<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a glass preform substantially free of OH impurities is 
disclosed. The method comprises the steps of introducing a moving stream of a vapor 

mixture including at least one compound glass-forming precursor together with an 
oxidizing medium into a tube, while generating a hydrogen-free isothermal plasma on 

an outer surface of the tube to react the mixture and produce a glassy deposit on an 
inner surface of the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the field of optical fibers, and more
particularly, to making optical fibers drawn from preforms.The widespread use of optical fibers (lightguides) in telecommunications,
medicine, and metrology can, in general, be directly related to the advent of low-loss
glass fibers. Though some loss is inherent, low loss fibers result from reducing the
loss mechanisms incorporated in the fiber during manufacture. These mechanisms
include, among others, impurities that act as light absorbers, and geometrical
distortions that lead to scattering of light inside the fiber.Additionally, widespread deployment of low loss optical fibers has generally
required that fibers possess the material strength to withstand placement in harsh
environments. This has been facilitated by reducing structural faults, such as bubbles
or chemical impurities, that can cause significant mechanical stress and weakening of
the fiber and/or can cause added loss. Typically, the loss mechanisms and structural
faults in an optical fiber drawn from a glass preform result from these imperfections
existing in the glass preform. Thus, to manufacture high strength, low loss glass fibers
efficiently, techniques must be employed that reduce the loss mechanisms and
structural faults present in the glass preform.When loss mechanisms and structural faults result from preform surface
imperfections, they can be substantially eliminated by removing surface material
comprising the imperfection (this removal process being referred to as an etching
process). Etching techniques, such as mechanical milling, chemical etching and
plasma etching, are available that can be applied to glass preforms.Conventional chemical etching is relatively slow and is typically not a clean
process. Though some imperfections are removed by chemical reaction, different
imperfections can be incorporated as a byproduct of the etching reaction. In addition,
chemical etching is typically preferential, which is generally not suitable for selectively 
removing preform surface material.Mechanical milling is adaptable to the normal processing environment,
but can introduce mechanical stress into the glass preform, and can lead to preform
structural failure (e.g., formation of cracks that can propagate through the preform).Imperfections can also be removed quickly and cleanly by contacting
the preform surface with an electrically conducting plasma region (a plasma fireball)
using a isothermal plasma torch. The surface material is substantially removed by
vapori

<CLAIMS>
A method for making an optical fiber substantially free of OH
impurities, comprising the steps of introducing a moving stream of a vapor mixture

including at least one compound glass-forming precursor and an oxidizing medium
into a glass tube, heating the outer surface of the glass tube, whereby the mixture

reacts and a glassy deposit is produced on an inner surface of the glass tube, and
drawing an optical fiber from the resulting glass-preform, characterized in that:


a hydrogen-free isothermal plasma heat source is used to heat the outer
surface of the glass tube.
The method of claim 1, wherein said heating step comprises the step
of heating with an oxygen plasma heat source.
The method of claim 2, wherein said oxygen plasma further comprises
argon.
The method of claim 1, wherein the glass tube is collapsed after the
glassy deposit is produced and glass-forming precursor vapors are maintained in the

glass tube during at least a portion of the collapsing.
The method of claim 1, wherein the temperature of the glass tube is
changed by adjusting an oxygen flow, or adjusting radio frequency energy provided

to the plasma, or adjusting the position of the plasma relative to the glass tube.
