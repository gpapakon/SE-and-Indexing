<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical
recording medium and a method of reading-out the same as known from
EP-A-0 498 461.Magneto-optical recording media are popularly used as
a high-density and low-cost rewritable information
recording medium. Especially, those having a recording
layer composed of an amorphous alloy of a rare earth metal
and a transition metal, show very excellent recording
characteristics.Magneto-optical disc is a recording medium with a very
large capacity, but further large capacity storage is
required with the advance of the increasing amount of
information in the society.The recording density of an optical disc is usually
decided by the size of the readout beam spot. Since the
spot size can be lessened by shortening the laser
wavelength, studies are being made for shortening the laser
wavelength, but great difficulties are involved in
attaining this purpose.On the other hand, various attempts such as a super
resolution technique have been made in recent years for
obtaining a higher resolution than decided by laser
wavelength. One of the noticeable proposals is a "magnetically
induced super resolution system" (hereinafter referred to
as MSR system) which makes use of the exchange coupling
force working between the multiple layers in a magneto-optical
disc. In one form of this system, there is used a
recording medium having an exchange-coupled magnetic layer
comprising a readout layer with small coercive force, a
cut-off (switching) layer with a low Curie temperature and
a memory layer with a high Curie temperature and a large
coercive force. When the medium is heated by readout beams
while applying a readout magnetic field, the exchange
coupling is broken at the high-temperature region of the
medium. Since the readout layer per se is small in
coercive force, the magnetization is oriented in the
direction of readout magnetic field in the high-temperature
region, thereby erasing the recording bits. Consequently,
the low-temperature region alone is read out. Thus, since
the readout area is actually narrowed, there is obtained
the same effect as when the readout beams are closed down,
allowing readout of high-density recording bits.The erased recording bits are revived since the
recording bits are transferred from the memory layer when
the medium temperature lowers to restore exchange coupling.
This system is called "front aperture detection system (FAD
system)" as the signal is detected in front of the readout
beam spot. A drawback to this FAD system is that a readout
