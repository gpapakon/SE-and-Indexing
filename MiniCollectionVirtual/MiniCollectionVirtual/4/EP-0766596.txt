<ABSTRACT>
A distributor system (18, 36) for uniformly directing vapor and liquid across the surface of a fixed bed (42) of solids in a downflow reactor (14). A first array of open-ended downpipes (33) has a plurality of vertically spaced elevations of holes (39, 40) above the level of a distributor tray (18). A second array of the downpipes (34) has at least one elevation of holes (41) but no elevation of holes as the same height as the lowermost elevations of holes (40) in the first array (33). The absence of holes causes the liquid flow rate through the distributor tray (18) at a given height to be reduced when that liquid height falls below the elevation of holes (39) second from the bottom in the first array (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-liquid
distribution system for downflow reactors which have one or
more fixed beds of solids. The distributor system of the
present invention is particularly useful for effecting
mixed-phase reactions between a liquid and a vapor over a
solid catalyst.Fixed-bed reactors typically contain one or more beds
of solid particulate catalyst over which a gas, a liquid,
or a gas/liquid mixture passes in a downward flow. Optimal
reactor performance is achieved when all catalyst is fully
contacted by the process fluid(s).It is common in fixed-bed reactors to employ multiple
solids beds disposed vertically throughout the vessel with
injection of gas or liquid between each pair of beds.
Interbed injection may be needed to replenish depleted
reactants, to quench the process fluids following
exothermic reactions, or to introduce a different feed
stream. If the beds contain different catalysts, it is
possible to stage somewhat different reaction zones within
a single vessel. In all cases it is critical to establish
good fluid distribution at the top of each catalyst bed.Distributor design for fixed-bed reactors typically
has two objectives. The first is completeness of coverage,
which usually involves maximizing the number of points from
which the distributor disperses the fluid onto the
catalyst. The second is uniformity of coverage, which
requires that the amounts of fluid dispersed from each
point be equal across the reactor. Of the two, uniformity
of coverage is more difficult to achieve because in
commercial reactors it is not practically possible to
assure perfect levelling of the distributor. Fabrication
and installation inaccuracies typically result in variation
of 3.18 mm (1/8") to 12.7 mm (1/2") in distributor
elevation across the diameter of a commercial vessel, and 
variations as large as 19.1 mm (3/4") have been measured.
Even if perfect leveling could be achieved at the outset,
it would likely deteriorate during operation as the reactor
internals are subject to thermal expansion and significant
static load. Typically distributor design involves
accepting a baseline variation in levelness and devising a
system to be as insensitive to these variations as
possible.The consequences of poor fluid distribution in fixed-bed
reactors can be severe. Poor micro-distribution, that
is local dispersion in the area of each distribution point,
leads to delayed contacting of reactants, and also to
regions of unutilized solids. Poor macro-distribution,
that is distribution across the
