<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an overheating detection 
circuit for use with a power integrated circuit (IC) and, more 
specifically to an overheating detection circuit comprising a 
simple circuit construction which may be formed in the same 
substrate as that of a power IC, and which can produce a large 
output signal in response to a detection of a temperature within a 
range of detection temperatures. Because power devices are used under high voltage and large 
currents, an abrupt increase in a load connected to the device or 
a shortcircuiting of the load can result in large currents in 
excess of the rated current of the device flowing through the 
device, thereby creating a danger that the device will become 
excessively heated and, in an extreme case, that the device will 
be destroyed. To protect a power device against such thermal 
destruction, the temperature of the power device is constantly 
monitored and, when the temperature of the device exceeds a 
predetermined temperature or an overheating of the device is 
detected, some protection action is taken, for example, the power 
device is turned-off. In monitoring a power IC, it is preferable to fabricate an 
overheating detection circuit including a temperature sensor into 
a substrate in which the power IC is formed in order to improve 
temperature sensitivity and to simplify the circuit arrangement. 
Typically, however, discrete elements have been used for forming a  
 
circuit which stops an operation of a power device upon 
detection of eddy currents or an overheating of the power 
device. In connection with this, a thermal sensor using a 
bipolar transistor as a thermo-sensitive sensor is described 
in E. Habekott√©, Bull, ASE/UCS 76 (1985), 9mars, pp. 272-276. From RCA Technical Notes 1270, 2 March 1981, pages 1 to 3 
"Thermal Shutdown Circuitry" by 0.H. Schade, a protection 
circuit for reducing the on-chip power dissipation when the 
chip temperature exceeds a predetermined threshold is known. 
The circuit comprises a detector element, implemented as a 
reverse biased diode for generating a leakage current which is 
strongly dependent on the junction temperature of the diode. 
The leakage current is amplified by a reasonable number of 
current mirror amplifiers which may be connected in cascade. 
The final amplifier stage comprises a transistor and a 
resistor which is connected between the base and emitter 
terminals of the transistor. When the current amplified by the 
cascade-connected current mirror amplifiers generates a
