<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method of ink jet printing on a cloth
with satisfactory saturation
and to a printed cloth obtainable by the printing
method.At present, textile printing is mainly performed by
screen printing and roller printing. However, the foregoing
methods are not suitable for manufacturing various products
in a small quantity and difficult to follow the fashion
quickly. Therefore, an electronic textile-printing system
using no plate has been desired.In order to meet the foregoing desire, a multiplicity
of ink jet textile-printing systems have been disclosed from
various industrial fields.The ink jet textile-printing system must meet the
following requirements: 
(1) Realized colors must have sufficiently thick density.(2) A high degree of exhaustion of pigment must be realized
on a cloth and waste water must easily be treated after the
washing process.(3) Irregular bleeding due to color mixture must be
restricted on the cloth.(4) A large color-reproduction range must be realized.(5) Production must always stably be performed.(6) Clear color must be realized.(7) Saturation must not deteriorate even in a case where
colors in the same type are mixed as well as in a case where
different colors are mixed with one another.In order to meet the foregoing desires, there have been
employed the following means: any of various additives is
added to an ink; the quantity of ink ejection is adjusted;
and the cloth is subjected to pre-treatment.EP-A-0 212 655 discloses ink-jet printing
on cloth with various disperse dyes. Printing
with two different inks is not mentioned.A textile-printing method using a disperse dye, for
example, an ink jet textile-printing method for printing on
a polyester cloth, has been disclosed in
JP-A-61-118477. The method uses a disperse dye,
the sublimation temperature of which is 180Â°C or higher.EP-A-0 533 760 (published 04.08.93 filing data
26.01.93, priority data 27.01.92) discloses ink-jet
printing with different inks, forming mixed color
regions. Disperse dyes are only generally mentioned.However, if textile-printing is performed by using an ink
comprising a disperse dye having a high-saturation hue while
paying attention to only the sublimation temperature,
excellent color can be imparted with excellent saturation in 
a case where each ink is used individually in dyeing.
However, some combinations of dyes, in the foregoing case,
deteriorate the saturation and considerably vary the
density, tone and the reproducibility after dyeing if dyeing
is performed under the
