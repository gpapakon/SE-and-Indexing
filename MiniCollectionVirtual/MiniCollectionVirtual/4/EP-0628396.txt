<ABSTRACT>
A marking insert for an injection mould, with a sleeve having a cylindrical receptacle and with a marking element held rotatably in the receptacle and prestressed in the axial direction. The technical problem is that of providing a marking insert whose marking element is stably guided and centred, in order that the desired markings are always reproduced accurately and in the correct position. In addition, the marking element is to be such that it can be screwed in and released just by a rotational screwing movement from the mould side. The receptacle has an inner collar (3) for the head (17), an adjoining passage (4) for the shank (18) of the marking element (16) and a hexagonal chamber (7) at the base for a hexagonal nut (12). The shank (18) of the marking element (16) bears a base thread (19) of greater diameter than the shank (18), and a compression spring (11) is arranged between the end face of the hexagonal nut (12) and the end wall of the receptacle.

A marking insert for an injection moulding tool with 
a sleeve (1) having a cylindrical receiver and with a 

marking body (16) which is held rotatably in the receiver 
and is pre-tensioned in the axial direction, the receiver 

having an inner collar (3) for the head (17) of the marking 
body (16) and, adjoining the inner collar (3), a passage 

(4) for the shaft (18) of the marking body (16), 
characterized in that a hexagonal chamber (7) at the base 

side is provided for a hexagonal nut (12), in that the 
shaft (18) of the marking body (16) has a base thread (19) 

with a larger diameter than the shaft (18), and in that a 
pressure spring (11) is arranged between the end face of 

the hexagonal nut (12) facing the passage (4) and the end 
wall of the receiver adjoining the passage (4). 
A marking insert according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the hexagonal nut (12) has a projecting collar (14) 

which surrounds an inner space (15). 
A marking insert according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the length of the unthreaded shaft (18) is, in the 

relaxed state of the pressure spring (11), smaller than the 
spacing from the end face of the inner collar (3) to the 

outlet face of the inner thread (13) of the hexagonal nut 
(12).
