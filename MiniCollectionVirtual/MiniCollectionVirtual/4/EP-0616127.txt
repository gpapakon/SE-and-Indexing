<ABSTRACT>
A structure of a piston of the pump of the trigger type liquid discharger in which pistons (101, 105) have annular skirts 
(102, 104, 106, and 108) extending to the approach end side and the stroke end side of the piston, and being structurally integral 

with each other to be in close contact with the inner wall of the cylinder (H) of said pump part (E); the entire width of each of 
said annular skirts (102, 104) in the axial direction is adapted to be as small as approximating to the axial length of the suction 

port (100) opened in the peripheral wall of said cylinder (H), or at least one underfill part (109 or 110) is formed in a position 
corresponding to said suction port (23) of the annular skirts (106, 108) on the stroke end side; so that the air can surely be sucked 

into the liquid container even when pistons (101, 105) move over only a short stroke as required by discharge of only a small 
quantity of liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in a piston
of a pump section of a trigger-type liquid dispenser or
sprayer to be fitted to an opening of a liquid container
for exhausting or ejecting the liquid content of the
container.In US-A-4,480,768 there is disclosed a hand-operated
pump for dispensing a fluid from a container which includes
a body containing a pumping chamber having an inlet and an
outlet conduit. A piston is reciprocably mounted in the
pumping chamber, the piston having a convexly contoured
outer end surface. A trigger pivotally mounted and locked
to the body has a plurality of triangular supports cojoined
to form a tapered socket receiving the outer end
surface of the piston. A channel-defining insert is
received in the outlet conduit, the insert having a
centrally situated, forwardly facing, fixed protuberance.
An elastic, cup-shaped member secured at its periphery to
the body has a central aperture situated in contact with
and closed by the fixed protuberance. The central aperture
of the cup-shaped member is a cavity in the center of the
interior surface of the member extending only partway
through the member, at least two depressions on the
exterior surface of the member spaced from each other and 
yet each intersecting the cavity, and a swirl chamber
situated between and connected to the depressions. The top
of the pump is mechanically secured to the outside of the
outlet conduit by tabs straddling and locking to the
conduit.Fig. 10 of the accompanying drawings illustrates a
conventional trigger-type liquid dispenser or ejector to be
fitted to an opening of a liquid container for exhausting
or ejecting the liquid content in the container, where a
tilted pump section A is arranged between a vertically
disposed dispenser main body B and a horizontally disposed
exhausting section C to allow a piston section D to have a
sufficient stroke so that the liquid content in the
container may be exhausted by a large amount in a single
stroke. When, however, the dispenser is made of synthetic
resin, it requires a cumbersome operation of being three-dimensionally
released from a mold in X-, Y- and Z-
directions, entailing necessarily the problem of the low
productivity.U.S. Patent No. 4,819,835 discloses an improved
dispenser for solving the problem of the low productivity.Fig. 8 of the accompanying drawings schematically
illustrates a trigger-type liquid dispenser disclosed in
the U.S. Patent No. 4,819,835. It includes a pump section
E and an exhausting section F arranged horizontally and in
par

<CLAIMS>
A piston (101, 105) and cylinder (H) arrangement of a pump
section of a trigger-type dispenser to be moved back and forth

within a cylinder (H) of the pump section by a trigger (2), the
piston (101, 105) having a first annular skirt (102, 106)

directed towards a rearward end of travel of the piston (101,
105) and a second annular skirt (104, 108) directed towards a

forward end of travel of the piston (101, 105) and formed
integrally with the first annular skirt (102, 106), the annular

skirts (102 and 104, 106 and 108) being held in close contact
with an inner wall surface of the cylinder (H) and an air intake

port (100) being provided in a peripheral wall of the cylinder
(H), 
characterised in that
 a forward edge of the second annular
skirt (104, 108) is adjacent to that side of the air intake port

(100) which is closer to the forward end of travel of the piston
(101, 105), whereby liquid is unable to pass through the air

intake port (100) should the dispenser be accidentally inverted,
whilst even a short stroke of the piston (101, 105) in the

rearward direction of travel thereof will open the air intake
port (100), 
in that
 a rear edge of the first annular skirt (102,
106) is adjacent to that side of the air intake port (100) which

is closer to the rearward end of travel of the piston (101, 105),
whereby liquid is unable to pass through the air intake port

(100) should the dispenser be accidentally inverted, whilst at
the same time substantially the whole distance from that side of 

the air intake port (100) to a bottoming-out end wall of the
cylinder (H) is available for travel of the piston (101, 105),

and 
in that
 the distance between the respective edges of the said
first and second annular skirts does not extend substantially

beyond the axial length of the air intake port when the piston
is at its forward end of travel.
A piston and cylinder arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the forward edge of the second annular
skirt (108) is provided by a notch (109, 110, 115, 116, 117, 118

or 119) therein.
