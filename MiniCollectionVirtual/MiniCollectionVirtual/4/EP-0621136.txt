<ABSTRACT>
A full-width ink-jet printer comprises a printhead (14) defining in a surface an array 
of nozzle (22) openings for the emission of ink droplets therethrough. A shuttle (50) is adapted 

to travel on a track (52,56) through a fixed path generally parallel to the array. Mounted on 
the shuttle (50) are an applicator (60) for applying a liquid to the nozzle (22) openings and a 

vacuum device (62) for applying suction to the nozzle openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink-jet printing, and is more particularly concerned 
with an effective liquid applicator/vacuum device for cleaning contaminants from a full-width 
array ink-jet printhead. In existing thermal ink jet printing, the printhead typically comprises one or more ink 
ejectors, such as disclosed in US-A-4,463,359, each ejector including a channel communicating 
with an ink supply chamber, or manifold, at one end and having an opening at the opposite 
end, referred to as a nozzle. In a single-color ink jet printing apparatus, the printhead typically comprises a linear 
array of ejectors, and the printhead is moved relative to the surface of the print sheet, either by 
moving the print sheet relative to a stationary printhead, or vice-versa, 
or both. In some types 
of apparatus, a relatively small printhead moves across a print sheet numerous times in swaths, 
much like a typewriter; alternatively, a printhead which consists of an array of ejectors and 
extends the full width of the print sheet may be passed once down the print sheet to give full-page 
images, in what is known as a "full-width array" (FWA) printer. When the printhead and 
the print sheet are moved relative to each other, imagewise digital data is used to selectively 
activate the thermal energy generators in the printhead over time so that the desired image 
will be created on the print sheet. With any kind of ink-jet printer in which a printhead is in close and extended contact 
with a substrate such as a sheet of paper with partially-dried ink thereon, an important 
practical concern is contamination of the area around the ejectors. External debris such as lint 
or stray paper fibers are likely to become caught in the small gap between the front face of the 
printhead and the sheet, possibly entering the nozzles of the ejectors and causing a failure of 
ejectors. Another cause of failure of individual ejectors is the fact that, if a particular ejector is 
not used for an appreciable length of time, even while the system is printing a document, a 
"viscous plug" of partially-dried ink will, in effect, cause a clot in the particular ejector, causing 
the ejector to fail at least temporarily, at least until the reheating of the particular ejector 
softens the viscous plug. A viscous plug often creates a partial blockage of an ejector, causing 
an ink droplet ejected therefrom to be misdirected. In ink-jet printers, a failure of even one 
ejector will have conspicuous results on a print, because the plugged

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printer comprising: 

a printhead (14) defining an array of nozzle (22) openings in a surface, the array 
extending in a main direction, for the emission of ink droplets therethrough; 
a shuttle (50); and 
a track (52,56), adapted to support the shuttle (50) thereon for movement in a path 
generally parallel to the main direction of said array 

of nozzle (22) openings characterized in that said shuttle (50) comprises a wetting device (60) for applying a 
liquid to one or more of the nozzle (22) openings and a vacuum device (62) for applying suction to one or 

more of the nozzle (22) openings. 
A printer as in claim 1, wherein 
said wetting device (60) is adapted 

to 
provide pressurized liquid into a nozzle (22) opening, preferably at a pressure of from 

about 0.015 to 0.075 PSI (0.104 to 0.518kPa). 
A printer as in claim 2, wherein the 
wetting device (60) 

is spaced apart from the surface during 
said movement, the device (60) preferably being adapted to create a meniscus of liquid that 

bridges to the surface.. 
A printer as in claim 1, wherein the wetting device 60 and the vacuum device are disposed 
on the shuttle (50) in a direction substantially parallel to the main direction of the array. 
A printer as in claim 4, wherein the shuttle is movable along said track alternately in a 
first direction, in which said vacuum device (62) is operative, and a second direction, opposite 

to said first direction, in which said wetting device (60) is operative. 
A printer as in claim 4 or 5, further comprising means (64,66) for resiliently 
supporting the wetting device (60) and the vacuum device (62) on the shuttle (50). 
A printer as in any of the preceding claims wherein the printhead (14) is pivotable 
about an axis (13), parallel to said main direction, between a first position in which the 

printhead (14) is operable to emit ink droplets, and a second position in which the printhead is 
in facing relationship with said shuttle (50).  

 
A printer as in any of claims 4 to 8, wherein the shuttle further includes a follower 
which is preferably adapted to maintain said wetting device (60) and/or said vacuum device (62) 

spaced apart from said surface during said movement. 
A method of maintenance for a printhead (14) having a surface defining an array of 
nozzle (22) openings for the emission of ink droplets therethrough, the array of nozzle 

openings extending in a main direction, comprising the steps of: 

(a) providing a shuttle (50) having a wetting device (60) and a 
vacuum device (62); 
(b) using said wetting device (60) to apply a liquid at a 
predetermined pressure into a nozzle opening; 
(c) using said vacuum device (62) to apply suction to said nozzle 
opening; and 
(d) moving the shuttle in a direction generally parallel to the main direction of the 
array of nozzle openings while applying said suction and said liquid to a series of nozzle openings in 

the array.
