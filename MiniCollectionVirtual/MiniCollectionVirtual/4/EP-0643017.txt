<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the use of 
novel hydrophobic polyelectrolyte compositions as coagulants 
for coal tailings thickening or concentrating. These 
polyelectrolyte compositions are preferably hydrophobically 
associating copolymers of diallyldimethylammonium chloride 
(DADMAC) and either dimethylaminoethylacrylate (DMAEA) or 
dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEM). Coal is the most abundant natural energy source in the 
world. A significant portion of the U.S. domestic energy 
requirements are met by burning coal as a fossil fuel. 
There are various types of coal found within the U.S., i.e., 
anthracite, semi-anthracite, low-volatile bituminous coal, 
medium and high volatile bituminous coal, sub-bituminous 
coal, and lignite. Coals such as anthracite and semi-anthracite 
typically have high ash and sulfur contents and 
therefore require beneficiation prior to use. The primary purpose of coal beneficiation is to reduce 
the incombustible ash content thus enhancing the heat 
content. Reduction in the ash content results in savings in 
transportation and ash disposal costs. Sulfur, mainly in 
the form of purite, is also reduced.  
 Another important economic factor to be considered in 
coal processing is the recovery and reuse of process water. 
Water is typically very expensive and there are often limits 
on total usage. Also, strict environmental controls 
prohibit or severely limit discharge of process water. 
Thus, it is imperative that solids be efficiently removed 
from the process water and water recycled to the process 
stream. Beneficiation of coal is effected using two primary 
properties of coal, i.e., (1) differences in specific 
gravity between coal and its impurities, and (2) differences 
in surface characteristics between coal and its impurities. 
Since the higher ash content fractions are usually found in 
the finer coal sizes, some plants only screen out these 
sizes to beneficiate the coal. However, since the quantity 
of such fine coal is on the rise, even this is treated. A coal beneficiation plant may be broadly categorized 
into specific gravity separation and fine coal treatment. 
In gravity separation, cleaning units make use of the 
differences in specific gravity between coal and its 
impurities to effect separation. Normally, the specific 
gravity of the clean coal is less than its impurities. Some 
commonly used equipment for gravity separation are: jigs, 
heavy medium baths and cyclones, washing tables, water only 
cyclones and spirals.
