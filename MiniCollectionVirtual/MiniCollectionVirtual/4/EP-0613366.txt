Hair colouring formulations containing indolines 
corresponding to formula I: 


 
in which R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ independently of one another 

represent hydrogens or C₁₋₄ alkyl groups or R⁴ and R⁵ 
together with the oxygen atoms to which they are attached 

represent a C₁₋₄ alkylenedioxy group,
 
or salts thereof in a carrier, characterized in that, in 

addition to the indolines corresponding to formula I or 
salts thereof in a quantity of 0.05 to 5% by weight, 

based on the hair colouring formulation as a whole, they 
contain typical substantive dyes in a
 quantity of 0.05 to 
5% by weight, based on the hair colouring formulation as 

a whole.

characterized in that, in addition to the indolines 
corresponding to formula I or salts thereof in a quantity 

of 0.05 to 5% by weight, based on the hair colouring 
formulation as a whole, they contain typical primary 

intermediates in a quantity of 0.05 to 5% by weight, 
based on the hair colouring formulation as a whole, and 

typical secondary intermediates in a quantity of 0.05 to 
5% by weight, based on the hair colouring formulation as 

a whole. 
Hair colouring formulations as claimed in any of 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the groups R¹, R², 

R³, R⁴ and R⁵ in formula I represent hydrogens and one of
