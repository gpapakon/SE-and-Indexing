<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing hydroxyoxaalkylmelamines
of the formula I



where R
1
 is a radical of the formula II

H(O-CHR'-CHR')
n

where the radicals R' can be identical or different and
are hydrogen or C
1
-C
4
-alkyl and n is 2 or 3, and the
radicals R
2
 and R
3
 are one of the radicals R
1
 or
hydrogen, by reacting melamine with a compound of the

formula III

H(O-CHR'-CHR')
n
-NH
2

where R' and n are as defined above, at from 120 to
250Â°C in the presence of an acid catalyst, wherein

hypophosphorous acid (H
3
PO
2
) in an amount of from 0.01
to 0.15 mol, based on one mol of melamine, is used as

acid catalyst.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein
hypophosphorous acid in an amount of from 0.01 to 

0.15 mol, based on 1 mol of melamine, together with a
strong or intermediate-strength protic acid or Lewis

acid are used as acid catalyst.
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein
phosphoric acid or ammonium chloride is used as strong

or intermediate-strength protic acid.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein R' is hydrogen and n is two (2).
