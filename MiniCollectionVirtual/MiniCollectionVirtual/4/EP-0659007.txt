<ABSTRACT>
The invention is an ISDN terminal equipment which will
maintain connectivity with existing analog modems by setting

up a voice-grade connection to existing analog modems
and using the power of a digital signal Processor DSP to

generate the digital equivalent of the analog modem signals
for transmission on an ISDN "B" channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of data 
communications and, more particularly, to a system and 
method for enabling a computer system to communicate with 
analog and digital devices. Data communication connections may be classified by the 
type of connection which is established between the caller 
and callee (or endpoint). The two types of connections are 
(1) leased, wherein the connecting line permanently connects 
the caller and endpoint; and (2) switched, wherein a 
connection may be established between a caller and any of 
one of multiple endpoints as required. Data communications 
connections may also be classified by the type of 
transmission technique which is used. They are (1) asynchronous 
(start/stop), wherein characters are transported 
as individual elements; and (2) synchronous, wherein characters 
are transported in contiguous packets. Thus, the 
data communications environment is divided into four 
classes represented by the combinations of the type of 
connection and transmission technique used. The asynchronous leased-line class is virtually empty. 
With the possible exception of outmoded industrial or 
governmental installations persisting from the period when 
switched-line data communication was not believed to be 
feasible, there are few users in this class of Data Communications.  Formerly, the concentration was on synchronous leased-line 
concentrators and terminal controllers. These uses have 
become far outnumbered due to the proliferation of inexpensive 
personal computers and workstations which almost 
invariably use asynchronous transmission. These single 
user devices often include asynchronous communications 
capability as a standard feature of the machine. Since switched-line communication is generally significantly 
less expensive than leased-line communication, and 
it is much more flexible, its acceptance has been much 
greater. Often no separate line cost need be considered. 
The popularity of switched-line communication is enhanced 
because it enables a personal computer to share an analog 
phone line otherwise used for voice communications. Thus, 
the most rapidly growing class of data communications is 
the asynchronous switched-line class. Despite the advent of digital networks, the use of analog 
technology to carry data has continuously increased. The 
number of modems which have been installed, especially 
asynchronous, switched-line modems, has grown significantly, 
and is expected to continue to do so in the future. 
This continued growth of

A system for providing information telecommunication 
services between a computing device and a selected 

one of plurality of diversely equipped analog and 
digital devices remotely linked to said computing 

device through parts of a public switched network, 
said computing device being required to be able to 

process information contained in signals transferred 
to said computing device via said network, said system 

comprising: 
a digital channel for carrying signals between said 

computing device and said network; said digital channel 
carrying digitized log PCM signal functions representing 

diverse types of information when said 
remote device is analog in nature, said digital channel 

carrying various other digital formats when said 
remote device is digital in nature and having various 

different signal formats in accordance with diverse 
characteristics of equipment at said devices; said 

log PCM signal functions being incompatible in form 
with information signal processing requirements of 

said computing device, and therefore the information 
content of said signal functions is not directly 

processable by said computing device while said signal 
functions are in said log PCM forms; and 

digital signal processing means for coupling said 
computing device with said digital channel for exchanging 

signals in diverse signal forms compatible 
with requirements of equipment at said remote devices, 

and for exchanging signals with said computing 
device in forms directly compatible with information 

processing requirements of said computing device but 
incompatible with signalling requirements of said 

remote devices, and for converting said signals in 
 

transit between said computing device and said digital 
channel into forms respectively compatible with 

said signalling requirements of said devices and said 
computing device.
