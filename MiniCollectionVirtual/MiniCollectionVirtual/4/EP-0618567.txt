<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
recording and reproducing apparatus of helical scan
type for recording and reproducing signals by using a
rotation head. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a signal recording and reproducing
apparatus capable of positively reproducing signals
recorded at predetermined positions of a recording
medium even when the reproduction is to be performed at
a speed which is different from the speed at which the
signals were recorded.In a signal recording and reproducing apparatus
of helical scan type, signals are recorded on or
reproduced from a tape-like recording medium such as a
magnetic tape by using rotation heads. A prior art
signal recording and reproducing apparatus of helical
scan type has a problem in that, when the recording
medium is made to travel at a high speed in reproduction,
it is very difficult to obtain data required for
the high-speed reproduction. This is because the path
of the head relative to the recorded tracks varies
depending on the traveling speed of the recording
medium. As a conventional solution to the problem, for
example shown in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 2-94071, the high-speed reproduction speed is
limited to only one specific speed, and data required
for the high-speed reproduction is recorded at a position
corresponding to the head path at that specific
speed. In such a prior art signal recording and
reproducing apparatus, the data for high-speed reproduction
is located at a position corresponding to the
head path at the specific high-speed reproduction
speed. Accordingly, the reproduction can basically be
performed only at that specific high speed, in addition
to the normal reproduction speed. In other words, it
is impossible to reproduce data for high-speed reproduction
at various high speeds.Moreover, when an image is to be reproduced
at various reproduction speeds by using the above
conventional solution, it is necessary to record data
for high-speed reproduction at positions corresponding
to the head paths at the various reproduction speeds.
This causes a problem of an increase in the recorded
bit rate.The apparatus for recording and reproducing
data of this invention is defined in claim 1. With the above construction, according to the
invention, it is possible to reproduce a fundamental
data group which is required for the reproduction at a
plurality of high speeds.If the recorded data is a video signal, it is
possible to perform the high-speed reproduction at a
plurality of high speeds, and the
