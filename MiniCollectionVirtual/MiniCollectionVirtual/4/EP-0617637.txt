<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski brake with doubly-bent wire brake arms pivoting in a base plate, the free braking pin sections of which, when in the ready position, are in a plane above the top of the ski and inside its two side surfaces. To this end there is an intermediate member which, with the ski brake in the ready position, is supported on the base plate and presses facing spring-linked end sections of the two wire brake arms away from the transverse axis of an actuating pedal. The purpose of the invention is to absorb overloads on the brake pin sections occurring in the braking position or during brake travel without having to reinforce the wire brake arms further. This is achieved by the invention in that at least one component or the whole of the braking device is supported against a stop so as to be elastically damped.

portions (7a-7'''a), and in the stand-by position, to be held 
in a depressed position above the ski top face with their 

free end portions (7a-7'''a) swiveled inwards in the direction

the force of at least one spring (6-6''') (a so-called erector 
spring), the end portions (7d-7''' d) of said wire brake 

arms located in said actuator pedal (5-5''') being angularly 
bent towards one another and interconnected by a coupling 

spring, or by a cross member so as to result in a U-shaped 
bow structure, said actuator pedal (5-5'''), spring (6-6''') 

and wire brake arms (7-7''') cooperating to form a brake mechanism, 

characterized
 in that in the braking position of the 
ski brake (1',1'',1'''), at least one component of said brake 

mechanism, and as the case may be, the brake mechanism of 
the ski brake (1,1'',1''') as a whole, takes resiliently-dampening 

support on a stop (11',11'',11'''), said stop (11',11'') 
being either mounted on a section of said actuator pedal 

(5') proximate to said transverse axis (4') or on the base 
(2''a) of said base plate (2''), or is formed by the cooperation 

of a leg (6'''a) of at least one torsion spring (6'''a) 
acting as said erector spring, with an abutment (12'''b) of a 

mounting plate (12'''), to act as said resiliently-dampening 
stop (11'''), the base plate (2''') as a whole being mounted 

for limited free displacement in a cavity (12'''a) of the 
box-shaped mounting plate (12'''), and in the stand-by position 

of said brake mechanism is retained in position by the 
lower leg (6'''a) of said torsion spring (6''') taking support 

on said abutment (12'''b) of said mounting plate (12'''), and

double-faced adhesive strip, to the component whereon it is 
mounted.
