<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds of
a stilbene derivative, a stilbene homologue derivative
and an α,β-diarylacrylonitrile derivative inhibiting
12-lipoxygenase selectively, and medicines containing
the above compounds as effective components; more
specifically, the present invention relates to a
stilbene derivative, a stilbene homologue derivative and
an α,β-diarylacrylonitrile derivative having an
effect of inhibiting the activities of 12-lipoxygenase
on the 12-lipoxygenase route selectively, and medicines
containing said compounds as effective components and
inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase selectively useful as
medicine for the prevention and remedies of various
circulatory diseases such as arteriosclerosis and
vasospasm and the prevention of the metastasis of some
cancers (e.g., Lewis lung cancer).In addition, the present invention relates to novel
compounds of a stilbene derivative and a stilbene
homologue derivative capable of forming a substance
whose modified part is cleaved in vivo and which
inhibits 12-lipoxygenase selectively, and medicines
containing the above compounds as effective components;
more specifically, the present invention relates to a
stilbene derivative and a stilbene homologue derivative
(hereinafter may be described as precursors) capable of
being converted to compounds whose modified parts are
cleaved in vivo and which inhibit 12-lipoxygenase on the
12-lipoxygenase route selectively, and medicines
containing said precursors as effective components and
inhibiting 12-lipoxygenase selectively useful as 
medicine for the prevention and remedies of various
circulatory diseases such as arteriosclerosis and
vasospasm and the prevention of the metastasis of some
cancers.The indication of percentage in the present
specification means values by weight unless otherwise
noted.It is known that a metabolic route called the 5-lipoxygenase
route exists in arachidonate cascade and
that arachidonate is converted to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
acid (hereinafter may be
described as 5-HPETE) by the function of 5-lipoxygenase
("Prostaglandin and Morbid States", edited by Seiitsu
Murota, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 1984).It is known that various leukotrienes are
biosynthesized with this compound as an intermediate
("Prostaglandin and Morbid States", edited by Seiitsu
Murota, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, 1984), and it is also known
that, for example, leukotriene B4 of these leukotrienes
has a strong leukocyte migration effect and is a
mediator of inflammations and that leukotriene C4 and
D4 are
