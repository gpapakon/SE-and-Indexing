<ABSTRACT>
A method for FM modulation of a digital carrier with a digital AF signal by means of a feedback-type phase accumulator and a carrier oscillator which generates the samples of the modulated FM oscillation, characterised in that the carrier oscillator operates at a sampling rate fA = 1/T which is greater than the FM bandwidth, in that a complex-valued FM intermediate-frequency signal g(kT) is generated, the intermediate frequency of the unmodulated carrier being f0 = 0 or, respectively, f0 = M.fA, with the integral number M 
>
 1, in that then real and imaginary part of the FM signal on each band are limited and interpolated by means of two identical real-valued low-pass filters and are filtered by means of two second identical real-valued low-pass filters for increasing the sampling rate fA by the factor L. Fully digitised frequency modulator with reduced nonlinear distortion after the demodulation, integrable as VLSI/ASIC chip, general application in the field of frequency modulation and especially in digital FM broadcasting and for transmitting its signals via optical fibre.
