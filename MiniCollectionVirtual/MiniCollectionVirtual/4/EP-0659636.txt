<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmission (drive) with an energy storing system for a bicycle. According to the invention, a spiral spring store (22) is mounted within a rear roadwheel (9), it being possible for an outer end of the spiral spring to be coupled to the roadwheel (9) and the other end of the spiral spring (22) being connected to an axial rear-wheel hollow shaft (16). Kinetic energy stored in the spiral spring store (22) is directed, so that it can be reused, by way of a rear-wheel pinion set (20) on the rear-wheel hollow shaft (16) via a chain (30) to a sprocket set (4) and is guided via a bottom-bearing hollow shaft (5), a sprocket set (3), a chain (29) and a rear-wheel pinion set (18) to drive the roadwheel (9). In conjunction with free-wheels (6, 7, 19, 25) this arrangement makes variable use of the energy storing system (22) possible.

Transmission with energy storing system for a 
bicycle, with a pedal crank arrangement comprising pedals 

as a pedal crank on a pedal crankshaft (2), a first 
chainwheel set (3) being arranged on a first side of the 

pedal crank arrangement and a second chainwheel set (4) 
being arranged on a second side, with a rear wheel 

arrangement comprising a running wheel (9) having a rim 
and a hub, and with a fixed rear-wheel axle (15), a first 

rear-wheel sprocket set (18) being arranged on a first 
side of the rear-wheel axle (15) and a second rear-wheel 

sprocket set (20) being arranged on a second side, with 
a first chain (29) for the rotatable connection of the 

first chainwheel set (3) to the first rear-wheel sprocket 
set (18) and with a second chain (30) for the rotatable 

connection of the second chainwheel set (4) to the second 
rear-wheel sprocket set (20), and with a spiral-spring 

storage device (22) as an energy storing system; characterized 
in that rotatably mooted on the pedal crankshaft 

(2) is a hollow bottom-bracket shaft (5), on one end of 
which the first chainwheel set (3) is rigidly mounted and 

on the other end of which-the second chainwheel set (4) 
is rotatably mounted; in that the hollow bottom-bracket 

shaft (5) is connected to the pedal crankshaft (2) by a 
freewheel (6) which freewheels when the speed of the 

pedal crankshaft (2) is lower than that of the hollow 
bottom-bracket shaft (5); in that the second chainwheel 

set (4) is connected to the hollow bottom-bracket shaft 
(5) by a freewheel (7) which freewheels when the speed of 

the second chainwheel set (4) is lower than that of the 
hollow bottom-bracket shaft (5); in that the first rear-wheel  

 
sprocket set (18) is connected, on the one hand, to 

the first chainwheel set (3) by the first chain (29) and, 
on the other hand, to the running wheel (9) by a free-wheel 

(19) which freewheels when the speed of the first 
rear-wheel sprocket set (18) is lower than that of the 

running wheel (9); in that rotatably mounted within the 
running-wheel region is a second wheel serving as a 

storage wheel (21), within which the spiral-spring 
storage device (22) is contained and into the region of 

which a hollow rear-wheel shaft (16) projects, where an 
inner end of the spiral spring of the spiral-spring 

storage device (22) is attached, and the hollow rear-wheel 
shaft (16) is rotatably mounted on the rear-wheel 

axle (15); in that the second rear-wheel sprocket set 
(20) is rigidly mounted on the hollow rear-wheel shaft 

(16) and is connected to the second chainwheel set (4) by 
means of the second chain (30); in that the speed of the 

second rear-wheel sprocket set (20) and of the hollow 
rear-wheel shaft (16) can be reduced relative to the 

speed of the storage wheel (21) by a speed reduction 
device that can be actuated by the cyclist; in that the 

other end of the spiral spring (22) is attached to the 
outside diameter of the storage wheel (21) or of the 

storage-wheel rim (26); in that the storage wheel (21) is 
connected to the running wheel (9) by way of a driving 

connection (27, 28); and in that the rotatably mounted 
storage wheel (21) is connected to the fixed rear-wheel 

axle (15) by a freewheel as a reverse-rotation lock (25) 
which supports the storage wheel (21) against backwards 

rotation. 
Transmission according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the speed reduction device is an actuable braking 

and/or locking device for braking and/or locking the 
rear-wheel sprocket set. 
Transmission according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the driving connection is situated 

at the outside diameter of the storage wheel (21) and is 
formed releasably by an adjustable slider (27) on the 

storage wheel (21) and by an associated lug component  
 

(28) on the running wheel (9), for the purpose of making 
a contact connection. 
Transmission according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the hollow rear-wheel shaft (16) 

projects with an overlap (17) from one side of the hub 
region of the running wheel (9), a first side of the 

running wheel (9) running with a first hub part (13) on 
the rear-wheel axle (15) and the other, second side of 

the running wheel (9) running on the overlap (17) of the 
hollow rear-wheel shaft (16). 
Transmission according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the outside diameter of the storage 

wheel (21) corresponds approximately to the inside 
diameter of the running-wheel rim and/or in that the 

storage wheel (21) has the same transverse dimension over 
its radial extent, corresponding to the smallest interior 

transverse dimension of the running wheel (9), with an 
associated identical transverse dimension of the spiral 

spring (22) arranged in the storage wheel (21). 
Transmission according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that when the energy storing system is relatively 

full, the driving connection can be released by the

of the spiral spring (22) and/or in that the lug component 
(28) is displaceable by means of actuable lever 

components as it passes a part of the frame. 
Transmission according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the locking means for the second rear-wheel 

sprocket set (20) comprises a locking bar which can be 
adjusted relative to a fixed part of the frame with the
