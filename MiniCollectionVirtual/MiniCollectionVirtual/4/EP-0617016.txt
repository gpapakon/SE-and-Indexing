<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel cyclohexene derivatives useful in the preparation 
of compounds having antibacterial activity and to processes for their 
preparation. European patent applications EPA Nos. 0416953A and 0422596A2 describe a 
novel class of tricyclic antibacterial agents and processes for their preparation. 
The present invention relates to novel intermediates which are particularly 
useful for preparing compounds within this class of tricyclic antibacterial 
compounds. Thus the present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I) 
wherein R₁ is a hydrogen atom or a nitrogen protecting group. The compounds of formula (I) contain two centres of asymmetry, one at 4 
position of the lactam ring and the other at the 3' position of the cyclohexene 
ring. For each centre of asymmetry there are two possible configurations which 
may be designated R and S in the conventional manner according to the rules 
of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, Experientia 1956, 12,81. The compound of formula 
(I) includes both the (4R), (3'S) isomer and the (4S), (3'R) isomer and mixtures 
thereof, including the racemate thereof. Examples of suitable nitrogen protecting groups R₁ include tri(C₁₋₆alkyl)silyl 
e.g. trimethylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl, C₁₋₄alkythio e.g. methylthio, 
C₁₋₆alkoxymethyl e.g. methoxymethyl, optionally substituted benzyloxymethyl 
e.g. benzyloxymethyl or p-methoxybenzyloxymethyl, or C₁₋₆alkylsilyloxymethyl 
e.g. t-butyldimethylsilyloxymethyl.  Conveniently the nitrogen protecting group R₁ is tri(C₁₋₆alkyl)silyl e.g. 
trimethylsilyl or more particularly t-butyldimethylsilyl. Preferred compounds of formula (I) are those which comprise of at least 50% of 
the (4R) (3'S) isomer (Ia) and more preferably 70-100% e.g. 85-100% of the 
(4R) (3'S) isomer (Ia). 
Preferred compounds of formula (Ia) include those wherein R₁ is hydrogen or a 
tri(C₁₋₆alkyl)silyl group e.g. trimethylsilyl or more particularly t-butyldimethylsilyl. The compound of formula (I) wherein R₁ is hydrogen may be prepared from the 
reaction of the azetidinone (II) 
wherein R₂ represents C₁₋₄alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl group with 
the borane derivative (III) 
wherein each of R₃ represents a C₆₋₁₀cycloalkyl group or the two R₃ groups 
together represent a 1,5-cyclooctadiyl grouping. When R₃ represents a
 
C₆₋₁₀cycloalkyl grouping this may be for example monocycloalkyl group e.g. 
cyclohexyl, or 2-methylcyclohexyl or a bicycloalkyl group e.g. isopinocampheyl. The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as an
