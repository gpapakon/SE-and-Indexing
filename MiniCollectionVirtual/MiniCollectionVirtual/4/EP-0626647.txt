<ABSTRACT>
A copying apparatus is connected to active and 
stand-by sections (11, 12) each of which has a specific 

data signal. The active section has a memory unit (14) 
for memorizing a plurality of data signals and an 

accessing unit (13) for accessing the memory unit to read 
one of the data signals as the specific data signal out 

of the memory unit in a readout operation. The accessing 
unit produces readout information which is representative 

of the readout operation. The copying apparatus 
comprises a memory section (23) of a first-in-first-out 

fashion that successively memorizes the specific data 
signal of the active section as a copied data signal to a 

predetermined data number. A monitoring section (24) 
monitors the memory section to produce a monitored signal 

when the number of the copied data signals is equal to 
the predetermined data number. A control section (31) 

controls the memory section in response to the monitored 
signal and the readout information to make the memory 

section stop memorizing the specific data signal of the 
active section as the copied data signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a copying apparatus for
copying a data signal as a copied data signal from a
first data section to supply the copied data signal to a
second data section.In general, it is known that a data system
comprises first and second data sections each of which
has a data signal. Such a data system may be used as a
data exchange system. The first and the second data
sections will be called first and second data processing
sections, respectively. In the data system, one of the
first and the second data processing sections serves as
an active data processing section. Another one of the
first and the second data processing sections serves as a
stand-by data processing section.The first data processing section comprises a
first central processing unit (CPU), a first main memory,
and at least one first peripheral device. The first CPU,
the first main memory, and the first peripheral device
are connected to one another by a first bus. Similarly,
the second data processing section comprises a second
CPU, a second main memory, and at least one second 
peripheral device. The second CPU, the second main
memory, and the second peripheral device are connected to
one another by a second bus.It will be assumed that the first and the second
data processing sections are operable as the active and
the stand-by data processing sections, respectively.
Under the circumstances, let the first data processing
section be changed to the stand-by data processing
section according to a result of a situation of the first
data processing section. In this event, the second data
processing section is changed to the active data
processing section. In order to continue processing in
the second data processing section, it is necessary to
make the content of the first main memory be equal to
that of the second main memory. Therefore, a
conventional data system further comprises a copying
apparatus for copying the content of the first main
memory as a copied data signal to supply the copied data
signal to the second main memory.The copying apparatus is connected to the first
and the second data processing sections. More
particularly, the copying apparatus is connected to the
first and the second buses. The copying apparatus
comprises a memory section of a first-in-first-out
fashion that is successively capable of memorizing the
data signal as a memorized data signal to a predetermined
data number. It will be assumed that the first and the second
data processing sections are operable as the active and
the stand-by data

<CLAIMS>
A copying apparatus (30) connected to active
and stand-by sections (11, 12) each of which has a

specific data signal, said copying apparatus being for
copying said specific data signal of said active section

as a copied data signal,

said active section comprising a memory unit (14) for
memorizing a plurality of data signals and an accessing

unit (13) for accessing said memory unit to read one of
said data signals as said specific data signal out of

said memory unit in a readout operation, said accessing
unit producing readout information which is

representative of said readout operation,

characterized by

memory means (23) for successively memorizing the
specific data signal of said active section as a copied

data signal to a predetermined data number;
monitoring means (24) for monitoring said memory
means to produce a monitored signal when the number of

said copied data signals is equal to said predetermined
data number; and 
control means (31) responsive to said monitored
signal and said readout information for controlling said

memory means to make said memory means stop memorizing
said specific data signal of said active section as said

copied data signal.
A copying apparatus as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized by:


detecting means (22) for detecting whether or not
said copied data signal is coincident with the specific

data signal of said stand-by section to supply said
copied data signal to said stand-by section when the

copied signal is coincident with the specific data signal
of said stand-by section.
A copying apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the accessing unit (13) is connected to said

memory unit (14) through a bus (16).
A copying apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein said copying apparatus is located between

said active and stand-by sections (11, 12).
