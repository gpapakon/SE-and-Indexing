<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a test circuit for the amperometric determination of the current flowing through a sensor (41). The circuit comprises a current source (V+, 46) for passing a direct current through the said sensor, switching means (45) for selectively controlling the said current source, means of comparison (42) for comparing the potential difference (VBS) across the terminals of the said sensor with a reference voltage (Vref) and for producing a control signal (D), control means (44) for controlling the said switching means (45) in response to the said control signal, and clock means (48, 49) for measuring the total elapsed time of the operation of the said switching means during a measurement period so as to determine an average value (IBSave) of the current flowing through the said sensor (41).
