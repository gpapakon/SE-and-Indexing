<ABSTRACT>
A symmetrical electroacoustical transducing apparatus 
includes a first electroacoustical transducing system 

(11,12,13,33) having first electroacoustical transducing 
structure (33) constructed and arranged to transduce 

spectral components in substantially the full range of 
audio frequencies. A second electroacoustical transducing 

system (14,15,31) has a second electroacoustical 
transducing structure (31) constructed and arranged to 

transduce spectral components only in the upper range of 
audio frequencies. The first and second electroacoustical 

transducing structures (33,31) are relatively displaced and 
coact to be capable of radiating a composite stereo sound 

signal when the first electrical transducing structure (33) 
receives a first electrical signal representative of a 

first stereo signal with spectral components in the upper 
frequency range and the second electroacoustical 

transducing structure (31) receives a second electrical 
signal representative of a second stereo signal with 

spectral components in the upper frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to 
electroacoustical transducing and more particularly 
concerns novel apparatus and techniques for stereo 
electroacoustical transducing. According to the invention, there are first and 
second transducing systems. The first electroacoustical 
transducing system is operative over substantially the full 
audio frequency range and is constructed and arranged to 
electroacoustically transduce input electrical signal 
spectral components in the upper frequency range of only a 
first stereo signal. The second electroacoustical 
transducing system is constructed and arranged to 
electroacoustically transduce spectral components in the 
upper frequency range only and representative of only those 
spectral components of the second of first and second 
stereo signals. The first electroacoustical transducing 
system preferably includes a first electroacoustical 
transducing structure for also transducing spectral 
components in the bass frequency range, preferably 
representing the sum of bass frequency spectral components 
in both the first and second stereo signals. The first and 
second stereo signals are typically left and right signals. According to one aspect of the invention, the first 
electroacoustical transducing system radiates only spectral 
components in the bass frequency range sufficiently low so 
that the source thereof is nonlocalizable. Typically the first electroacoustical transducing 
system includes a summer having a first input connected to 
a first stereo signal input terminal and a second input 
coupled to a lowpass filter having its input coupled to a 
second stereo input terminal. The first stereo 
electroacoustical transducing system typically includes a  
 
first equalizer and first amplifier intercoupling the 
output of the summer and the first electroacoustical 
transducing structure. The first electroacoustical 
transducing structure typically includes a woofer and upper 
frequency driver with a capacitor coupling the output of 
the first amplifier to the upper frequency driver. 
Alternatively, there may be a full range driver coupled to 
the amplifier. The second electroacoustical transducing 
system typically includes a second equalizer, a second 
amplifier and an upper frequency driver. According to one form of the invention, there are 
first and second enclosures. The first enclosure includes 
a woofer driver mounted between first and second 
subchambers ported to the outside embodying the principles 
of Bose U.S. Patent No. 4,549,631
