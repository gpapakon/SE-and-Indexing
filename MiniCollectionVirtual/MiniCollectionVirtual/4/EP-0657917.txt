<ABSTRACT>
A wire bonding apparatus has an image pickup unit for 
obtaining image data of an image frame of a square area 

encompassing wire bond objects including electrode pads of 
an IC chip and corresponding inner leads of a lead frame. 

The image of the square area is picked up at the bonding 
station where the bonding operation is executed. The image 

data is transmitted to an image processing unit, which 
detects the position of each of inner leads and electrode 

pads and calculating deviations of position of each of wire 
bond objects from corresponding design position stored in a 

memory unit. A control unit controls XY-table based on the 
deviations to align a bonding tool to each of the bonding 

points of the wire bond objects. In the case of lead 
frames, tape carriers or ceramic packages, the accuracy of 

wire bonding can be improved without being affected by 
deformation of the inner leads due to transportation, 

thermal deformation, thermal expansion, or vibration 
remaining in the image pickup unit. In addition, the amount 

of time required for the detecting operation can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire bonding
apparatus used for fabricating a semiconductor integrated
circuit (hereinafter referred to as an "IC") device.Wire bonding apparatus is used for manufacturing an IC
device in a final stage of the fabrication thereof. A
conventional wire bonding apparatus will be described below
with reference to drawings.Figs. 1 and 2 show plan views each illustrating a
general configuration of an IC chip and a lead frame before
or after bonding operation is performed thereto. Fig. 3
shows a cross-sectional view along line A-A' of Fig. 2,
while Fig. 4 shows a plan view of a lead frame in which a
plurality of IC chips are fabricated.In Figs. 1 through 3, the IC chip 6 has been fixed,
prior to a bonding operation onto the lead frame 11, in a
region surrounded by inner leads 5 for connection of the
electrode pads 7 of the IC chip 6 with the inner leads 5 of 
an IC package by wires 20. As shown in Fig. 4, a plurality
of IC chips 6 are successively arranged on a single lead
frame 11 at a constant pitch for a mass production.
Position marks 21a and 21b both serving as reference
coordinates for the positions of all of the inner leads 5
are provided for corresponding one of the IC chip 6. Tips
of some of the inner leads 5 may be used as a substitute for
the position marks 21a and 21b. The IC chip 6 also has
position marks 7a and 7b each constituted by an electrode
pad as shown in Fig. 1.In a conventional wire bonding apparatus for bonding
the electrode pads 7 of the IC chips 6 with the inner leads
5 of the lead frame 11 as described above, a detection
camera for detecting position of each of wire bond objects
including electrode pads 7 and corresponding inner leads 5
is generally fixed to an XY-table moving in a horizontal
direction, on which a bonding head is mounted. Before a
bonding operation is carried out, the detection camera is
successively moved by the XY-table to a location right above
each of the position marks 7a, 7b, 21a and 21b and the
bonding point of each of the inner leads 5 so as to store
the coordinates of each of the electrode pads 7 and the
inner leads 5. Thereafter, a wire bonding operation is
carried out while moving the bonding head by the XY-table
based on the stored coordinates. Fig. 5 shows a detail of a portion of an area
encompassing wire bond objects including the inner leads 5
and the electrode pads 7 of Fig. 1. In the region as shown
by Figs. 1 and 5, a detection camera is first moved to each
of the positions of specific electrode pads 7a and 7b
servi
