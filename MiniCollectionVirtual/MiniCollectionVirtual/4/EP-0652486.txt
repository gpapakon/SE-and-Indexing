<ABSTRACT>
This is a device and method of forming such, wherein the device has 
an amorphous "TEFLON" (TFE AF) layer. The method comprising: 

depositing an TFE AF layer 36 on a substrate; combining a fluorosurfactant 
with a first material to produce a second material 38; and depositing the 

second material 38 on the TFE AF layer 36. The method may include: 
patterning and etching the second material; removing the second material; 

and forming a third material 42 on the TFE AF layer 44. The third material 

may be a metal or a semiconductor. The ZFSNF fluorosurfactant may be 
combined with a photoresist and then patterned and etched. The TFE AF 

layer may also be heated. A second coating of the second material may also 
be added.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed towards the field of fabrication of electronic
and optoelectronic components, and in particular to a method of patterning
a TFE AF layer.As device geometries continue to decrease in electronics and
optoelectronics, capacitance density will increase and the performance of
integrated circuits will be limited by the high RC time constants caused by
high resistivity metals and high capacitance interlevel dielectrics (ILD).
Reducing the dielectric constant of the interlevel insulator will not only
enhance performance, but also decrease the power consumption and crosstalk
of electronic/optoelectronic devices.For a given interconnect layout, both power dissipation and crosstalk
decrease as the dielectric constant of the insulator decreases. Figure 1
shows the power dissipation of 0.25 mm and 0.50 mm metal lines when
different ILDs are used. The data show that using the same dielectric,
scaling down from 0.50 mm to 0.25 mm will result in a 30% increase in power
dissipation. The power dissipation can be decreased more than 50% if SiO2
ILD is replaced by a copolymer made from tetraflouroethylene and 2,2-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,5-difluoro-1,3-dioxole
(TFE AF). (TFE AF is
commercially available from "DU PONT" in a product known as amorphous
"TEFLON"; "TEFLON" is a polymer made from polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) also commercially available from "DU PONT"). This change is
particularly important for high frequency operation because power 
dissipation increases proportional to frequency. The power consumption can
be further reduced if a metal of lower resistance, such as Cu, is used to
replace current metalization materials such as Al or W.Figure 2 shows the crosstalk between 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm metal lines
when the power supply voltage (Vcc) is 1 V. The crosstalk increases more
than 50% when the design rule is reduced from 0.5 mm to 0.25 mm,
primarily due to the increase in line-to-line capacitance. The increase in
crosstalk/Vcc ratio degrades the noise margin and hence circuit performance.
Replacing SiO2 by TFE AF will significantly reduce crosstalk.Several material properties are required for a successful low-er
technology. These include: 1) low dielectric constant, 2) high mechanical
strength, 3) good thermal stability, 4) high dielectric strength and low
leakage current, 5) low stress, 6) good adhesion, 7) good gap filling
capability/ease of planarization, 8) ease of pattern and etch, 9) low water
absorptivity, 10) good etch selectivity to metal and 11) good thermal
conductivity. A list
