<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for measuring the instantaneous torque 
of an engine by measuring the change in pressure in the 

combustion chamber at two crank angles. The crank angles are 
chosen to approximate the time when the change in pressure is 

the greatest and when the pressure is the greatest and the 
change in pressure is zero. These crank angles may be either 

determined by measuring the values or by approximately the 
crank angles at which the values will exist. In some 

instances, the torque is measured by summing the change in 
pressures during the time interval and in other methods the 

torque is measured by determining the pressure difference at 
the two crank angles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine torque-detecting method 
and apparatus therefor, and more particularly to an improved 
method and apparatus for measuring engine torque during 
running. It is well known to attempt to improve the efficiency and 
exhaust emission control of an internal combustion engine to 
operate it in such a manner as to accurately control the 
amount of fuel supplied to the engine. Also, other engine 
parameters are controlled in order to maintain good 
combustion with the minimum amount of fuel for environmental 
and efficiency reasons. In order to ensure stable running, 
however, it is necessary to ensure that adequate amounts of 
fuel are provided to the engine and that other running 
conditions are accurately controlled. Therefore, there is a 
need to measure the actual engine output so as to ensure 
stability in its operation. For example, it is known that fuel economy and exhaust 
emission control may be achieved by operating the engine on 
a so-called "lean burn" system at least at low and partial 
lows. With lean burn running the fuel-air mixture supplied 
to the combustion chamber is less than stoichiometric. 
However, it is also known that the limits of lean burn may 
be readily determined by measuring the output torque of the 
engine. When the output torque falls below a predetermined 
value it is known that the stability and engine running 
speed will deteriorate significantly. Therefore, it is 
desirable to be able to measure the output torque of the 
engine during its running so as to permit optimization of 
the lean burn running.  Obviously, it is not possible to measure the engine output 
in the form of torque through the use of normal measuring 
apparatus employed for engine testing. That is, the 
torque-measuring devices used to determine the performance 
of the engine cannot be incorporated feasibly in a motor 
vehicle. There have, therefore, been proposed methods for attempting 
to measure the engine output torque during its running by 
measuring some other parameter of the engine. It has been 
found that pressure in the combustion chamber can be 
utilized to project engine output torque and ensure 
stability in running. One method for measuring the engine 
output torque has been to sample the pressure readings at a 
number of output shaft angles during a single cycle of 
operation beginning near the end of the compression stroke 
and ending during the power or expansion stroke and then 
predict the engine torque from these readings. However, the 
necessity of
