<ABSTRACT>
A gasket (10) for sealing two flange faces against each other 
comprising at least two compressible layers (21,22), a reinforcing metal 

ring (26) sandwiched between the compressible layers (21,22), said 
compressible layers and metal ring having a combined thickness 

and an inner and an outer edge, a resilient O-ring (24) located at the 
inner edge of the combined compressible layers and metal ring, 

said O-ring having an inner edge and having a diameter greater 
than said combined thickness, and a fluoropolymer sheet (18) 

enveloping the O-ring (24) and combined compressible layers (21,22) 
and metal 

ring (26) to form the gasket such that when the gasket is installed 
the fluoropolymer sheet contacts both flange faces and covers the 

inner edge of the O-ring. The gasket is particularly suitable 
for sealing the surfaces of glass coated flanges where the 

contents of materials within the flanges are under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seals for flanges faces and more 
particularly relates to sealing gaskets for such flange faces. Gaskets for sealing flange faces together are well known in 
the art. Unfortunately readily removable and cost effective 
gaskets for sealing flanges faces have not been as good as 
desired, especially when the flange faces have been glass coated 
and surround openings in vessels or conduits having corrosive 
contents which are under pressure, e.g. 300 psi or higher. Under 
such conditions seals between flange faces have often been known 
to leak or even blow out. Further such known gaskets require 
high seating loads which can cause glass lining failures. Such 
seals also require a large number of clamps or bolts around the 
seal area in order to maintain the high loads required. In 
addition such seals have required the use of flange thicknesses 
which are greater than desired because thick flanges have been 
necessary to withstand the high loads. Known seals for glass and other smooth surfaces generally 
use gaskets having flat surfaces which can seal a almost any 
location on the surface. Such seals are not as sanitary as 
desirable for pharmaceutical and food applications due to cracks 
at the edge of the contact areas between the sealing flange and 
gasket which may harbor contamination because the actual seal may 
be formed at another location on the flat gasket surface.  It has been known to use O-rings to form seals between 
flange faces; however, grooves have been placed in the flange 
faces in order to position and retain the O-rings, especially 
when any significant pressure is involved. Such grooves still do 
not retain the O-rings as well as desired and such grooves cannot 
be practically placed in a glass coated flange surface. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved gasket for flange faces to overcome 
disadvantages of gaskets for flange faces known to those skilled 
in the art. Figure 1 shows a top view of a gasket in accordance with the 
present invention. Figure 2 shows a magnified cross sectional view of the 
gasket of figure 1 taken on lines 2-2 of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows a cross sectional view of a gasket in 
accordance with the present invention in compression and sealing 
two flange faces. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a 
gasket for sealing two flange faces against each other comprising 
at least two compressible layers, a reinforcing metal ring 
sandwiched between the compressible layers, said

<CLAIMS>
A gasket for sealing two flange faces against each other 
comprising at least two compressible layers, a reinforcing metal 

ring sandwiched between the compressible layers, said 
compressible layers and metal ring having a combined thickness 

and an inner and an outer edge, characterized in that a resilient 
O-ring is located at the inner edge of the combined compressible 

layers and metal ring, said O-ring having an inner edge and 
having a diameter greater than said combined thickness, and a 

fluoropolymer sheet enveloping the O-ring and combined 
compressible layers and metal ring to form the gasket such that 

when the gasket is installed the fluoropolymer sheet contacts 
both flange faces and covers the inner edge of the O-ring. 
The gasket of claim 1 wherein it is in a sealing position 
between two flange faces. 
The gasket of claim 2 wherein a first of said flanges is a 
flange at an opening in a vessel and a second of said flanges is 

a flange on a cover for said opening and said inner edge of said 
O-ring and said inner edge of said combined compressible layers 

and metal ring both face toward the vessel opening. 
The gasket of claim 2 wherein flanges are flanges about 
sections of conduit having a conducting opening therethrough and 

said inner edge of said O-ring and said inner edge of said 
combined compressible layers and metal ring both face toward the 

conducting opening. 
The gasket of claim 2 wherein the two flange faces are 
forced together by means of bolts with the gasket in sealing 

relationship therebetween. 
The gasket of claim 2 wherein the two flange faces are 
forced toward each other by means of clamps with the gasket in 

sealing relationship therebetween. 
The gasket of claim 1 wherein the fluoropolymer sheet is 
polytetrafluoroethylene. 
The gasket of claim 1 wherein the compressible layers 
comprise Kevlarî‹“. 
The gasket of claim 1 wherein the metal ring comprises 
stainless steel having a thickness of from one-sixteenth to one-eighth 

inch. 
The gasket of claim 2 wherein the surfaces of the flanges 
are glass coated.
