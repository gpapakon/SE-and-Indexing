<ABSTRACT>
A mobile rail line 2 with an essentially horizontal wagon runway 16 resting on the chassis 4 is distinguished by the fact that the rail line 2 has a pack of several track elements 18 - 24 displaceably arranged one inside the other, of which in each case the outer track element, after its extension, is held in a horizontal position by means of its coupled supporting legs 32. By the extension of the track elements 14, 18 - 24, a rail line 2 is advanced over the ground like a bridge up to the desired location. The rail line 2 enables a wagon with an appropriate tool to approach the target location and remove the conveyed material from the target location. The relevant rail line 2 can be easily manoeuvred at any location and to this end can be given any length within certain limits without thereby jeopardizing its stability.
