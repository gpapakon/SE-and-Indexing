<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a wear-resistant surface coating for the rollers of high-pressure roller mills for pressure-grinding of granular material, which is suitable for autogenous wear protection, simple in terms of production and has, even when acted upon with great pressing pressure loads, a great service life capacity with a minimised risk of tear formation, it is proposed according to the invention to weld onto the roller surface by form welding a large number of profiles arranged at a distance from one another, such as in particular knob bolts (17), and in particular with the aid of a mould (11) which is placed on the basic roller body (10) and provided with continuous radial openings (12, 13, 14) which are filled with application welding material, whereupon the preferably water-cooled mould (11) is lifted off the roller (10) after solidification of the welding material.

<CLAIMS>
A method to yield a wear-resistant surface reinforcement for the rollers of 
high-pressure roller presses for the pressure-comminution of granular 

material, with a plurality of outwardly-projecting profiles arranged at a 
distance apart from one another on the roller surface, especially stud-type 

bolts,
characterised in that
 a chill mould (11) matched to the contours of the roller 
surface is laid on the basic body (10) of the roller or on its linings/segments 

and is provided with radial through-openings such as through-holes (12, 13, 
14) which correspond in size and distance apart to the field of profiles such 

as stud-type bolts (17) and the radial through-openings (12, 13, 14) of the 
chill mould are filled with build-up weld materials, after which once the weld 

material has set the chill mould (11) is lifted off the roller (10). 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the chill mould (11) is 
provided with coolant channels (15, 16) and can be connected to a coolant 

delivery and drain line. 
A method according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 the chill mould 
(11) is manufactured from copper or a copper alloy.
