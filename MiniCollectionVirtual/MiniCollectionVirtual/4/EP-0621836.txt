<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pumping set for a controlled braking system (ABS/drive slip control). In such an assembly, brake fluid forced by the piston accumulates in the spaced around the eccentric (4) and, when in sufficient quantity, is pressurised by the moving pistons. The use of a simple outlet channel in the environment raises problems, at least in immersion-proof vehicles, through the penetration of moisture and dirt. The invention helps here by the introduction of a check valve (15) fitted in the outlet channel which is so designed that it opens under the weight of the accumulated brake fluid and reliably prevents the ingress of dirt and moisture in the opposite direction.

<CLAIMS>
A pump assembly including a piston pump driven by an 
electric motor through an eccentric (4) and adapted for use 

in a controlled brake system for automotive vehicles, 
wherein a connecting conduit (12) is provided between a 

space (7) directly surrounding the eccentric (4) and an exit 
aperture (14) in the pump housing (1) placed beneath this 

space (7) in the installation position of the pump (1),
characterized
 in that the exit aperture (14) 
opens into the ambient space and in that a non-return valve 

(15) opening towards the exit aperture (14) is arranged in 
the connecting conduit (12). 
A pump assembly as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the non-return valve 
(15) is dimensioned such that it opens in response to the 

load exerted by a quantity of pressure fluid which 
accumulated upstream of the movable seal (23). 
A pump assembly as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that it opens in response to 
the weight exerted by the quantity of pressure fluid. 
A pump assembly as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized
 in that the non-return valve 
(15) is a complete unit inserted into the connecting conduit 

(12), wherein a valve member (16), preferably made of 
plastic having a sealing edge (19), carries a seal (23) 

which, under preload, abuts with a circumferential sealing  
 

surface on the sealing edge (19). 
A pump assembly as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the preload is generated 
by the curving of the seal (23) because the plane of 

abutment of the seal (23) with the sealing edge (19) is 
offset in the direction of outlet of the pressure fluid with 

respect to the attachment of the ring seal (22) to the valve 
member (16). 
A pump assembly as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized
 in that the valve member (16) is 
pressed into the connecting conduit (12), thereby effecting 

a seal, or is inserted into the connecting conduit (12), 
thereby effecting sealing through a circumferential ring 

seal (26). 
A pump assembly as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized
 in that the exit aperture (14) 
of the connecting conduit (7, 11, 8, 12, 14) is a 

through-bore (13) in the pump housing (1) which serves to 
accommodate an assembly screw (2) and ex
tends substantially 
in a horizontal direction in the installation position of 

the pump assembly.
