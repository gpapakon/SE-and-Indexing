<ABSTRACT>
Air compression systems for internal combustion 
engines are utilizing an integral part of the engine to 

produce the compressed air necessary for operating the 
brakes of a vehicle. The ability to produce compressed air 

from an integral part of the engine is important in order 
to reduce the cost and weight associated with the engine 

and to increase performance capability and reliability. 
The integral air compression system (10) includes a valve 

means (32) associated with one of a plurality of combustion 
chambers (20). A housing (42) is connected to a cylinder 

head (18) and has first and second bore (44,46). A master 
piston (50) is disposed within the first bore (44) to 

define a first oil chamber (52). A slave piston (54) is 
disposed within the second bore (46) to define a second oil 

chamber (56). A means (60) fluidly connects the first and 
second oil chambers (52,56). The master piston (50) is 

forced toward the first oil chamber (52) when another one 
of the combustion chambers (21) is in the exhaust stroke. 

The second oil chamber (56) becomes pressurized and forces 
the slave piston (54) to open the valve means (32) during 

the compression stroke of the one combustion chamber (20) 
allowing compressed air to flow through a passage (30) in 

the head (18) and into a storing means (36). A means (80) 
for monitoring the pressure in the storing means (36) is 

utilized to control the integral air compression system 
(10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to internal combustion engines 
and more particularly to an integral air compression system 
therefor. Air compression systems for internal combustion 
engines normally include a separately mounted air 
compressor which produces compressed air mainly for the 
purpose of operating the brakes of a vehicle. The 
separately mounted air compressor increases the overall 
cost and weight of the internal combustion engine, and due 
to the horsepower needed by the engine to drive the air 
compressor even when compressed air is not in demand, 
overall engine reliability and performance is decreased and 
fuel consumption is increased. For these reasons, it is 
known in the prior art to eliminate the separately mounted 
air compressor and to utilize one or more of the engine's 
cylinders as a compressed air source. However, the prior 
art generally relates to systems which draw compressed air 
from the cylinders on a full-time basis. The inability of 
the prior art to control when the cylinders are utilized as 
a compressed air source may hamper engine performance by 
reducing power within the cylinders during normal 
operation. One prior art reference discloses a electronically 
controlled air compression system wherein the compressed 
air is devoted to driving the engine's turbocharger. This 
system discloses an electronic control means which sends a 
control signal to actuate the intake and exhaust means 
independently so that the compressed air is drawn from the 
engine's cylinder in response to specific operating 
parameters. The compressed air is then immediately 
directed to drive the engine's turbocharger. The ability 
of this system to respond to engine parameters 
substantially eliminates the performance problems which may 
plague full-time dedicated air compression systems. 
However, the electronic control means is a complicated and  
 
expensive system which increases the overall cost of the 
engine and is specific for driving the turbocharger. US-A-4492192 discloses an integral air compression 
system for an internal combustion engine having a block 
defining a plurality of cylinders, a head mounted in 
closing relation to the cylinder block to define a 
plurality of combustion chambers, a piston reciprocally 
disposed within each of the cylinders and movable between 
top dead centre and bottom dead centre positions 
sequentially defining an intake stroke, a compression 
stroke, an expansion stroke, and an exhaust stroke, and 
exhaust means operatively associated with each
