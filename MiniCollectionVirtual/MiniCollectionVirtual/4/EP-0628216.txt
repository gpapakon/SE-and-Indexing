<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical hydrogen storage alloy having decreased hydrogen overpressure as well as other desirable operational parameters, comprising on an atomic percent basis: 14 to 22 vanadium; 28 to 39 percent nickel; 7 to 15 percent titanium; 15 to 34 percent zirconium; and at least one member selected from the group consisting of 0.001 to 7 percent chromium, 0.0001 to 7 percent cobalt, 0.001 to 7 percent iron, 0.001 to 3.6 percent manganese and 0.001 to 2.7 percent aluminum, wherein the atomic ratio of the vanadium to zirconium is in the range of 1:2.26 to 1:0.68. An electrochemical hydrogen storage alloy having a reduced self-discharge rate comprising an alloy having a heterogeneous, disordered microstructure resulting from changes in the mutual solubility of the elements of the alloy, wherein hydrogen in a particular phase is not easily discharged either through a low surface area or an oxide of limited porosity or catalytic property. The alloy is used in the negative electrode (12) of an electrochemical cell (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrochemical hydrogen 
storage alloy according no claim 1 and to rechargeable 
electrochemical cells accoring to claim 4. More particularly, 
the invention relates to rechargeable cells and batteries 
having negative electrodes formed of multicomponent, electro-chemical 
hydrogen storage alloys according to claim 1, cells 
Which incorporate the alloy of the present invention are 
characterized by superior electrochemical properties, a low 
hydrogen overpressure, and/or low self-discharge rate under 
conditions of use. Secondary cells using rechargeable hydrogen storage negative 
electrodes are an environmentally non-threatening, high energy 
density, electrochemical power source. Such hydrogen storage 
cells operate in a different manner than lead acid, nickel-cadmium, 
or other battery systems.  
 A rechargeable hydrogen storage electrochemical cell or 
battery utilizes a negative electrode that is capable of the 
reversible electrochemical storage of hydrogen. Hydrogen 
storage cells usually employ a positive electrode of nickel 
hydroxide material although other positive materials may be 
used. The negative and positive electrodes are spaced apart in 
an allcaline electrolyte. A suitable separator, i.e., a 
membrane may also be positioned between the eletrodes. 
Upon application of an electrical potential across a hydrogen 
electrochemical cell, the negative electrode maternal (M) is 
charged by the electrochemical absorption of hydrogen and the 
electrochemical evolution of a hydroxyl ion: 
M + H2O + e- → M-H + OH-Upon discharge, the stored hydrogen is released to form a 
water molecule and evolve an electron: 
M-H + OH- → M + H2O + e-In the reversible (secondary) cells of the invention, the 
reactions are reversible. The reactions that take place at the positive electrode of a 
secondary cell are also reversible. For example, the reactions 
at a conventional nickel hydroxide positive  
 
electrode as utilized in a hydrogen rechargeable secondary cell are: 
Ni(OH)2 + OH- → NiOOH + H2 + e- (Charging),NiOOH + H2O + e- → Ni(OH)2 + OH- (Discharging).A secondary cell utilizing an electrochemically rechargeable hydrogen storage 
negative electrode offers important advantages over conventional secondary cells and 
batteries, such as nickel-cadmium cells, lead-acid cells, and lithium cells. First, hydrogen 
storage secondary cells contain no cadmium, lead, or lithium; and thus, are not a hazard 
to consumers or to the environment. Second, electrochemical cells with
