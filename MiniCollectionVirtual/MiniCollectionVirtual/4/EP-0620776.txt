<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a recyclable agglomerate from plastic waste, the base material used contains besides pure plastic waste, fibrous and/or coated, impure plastic waste. This base material is at first ground and mixed, and then goes at least twice through a treatment cycle with a heating and a cooling phase.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing a recyclable agglomerate from 
plastic waste, in which 


a) in addition to pure plastic waste, the starting 
materials used for the method also contain fibre-containing 

and/or coated contaminated plastic waste, 
b) the starting materials are comminuted, mixed, heated and 
cooled, and 
c) the comminuted and mixed starting materials go at least 
twice through a treatment cycle consisting of heating 

and cooling, 
 
characterised in that 


d) during the treatment cycle the plastic waste at raised 
pressure of 5 to 10 bars is heated
 to a temperature of 
110 to 170°C, preferably 150 to 160°C, and cooled by the 

delivery of water to a temperature below 100°C. 
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the 
proportion by weight of the pure plastic waste is greater than 

that of the contaminated plastic waste. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the plastic waste is heated by agitation 

work. 
Method as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that 
agitation work is performed for 5 to 20 minutes, preferably 8 

to 10 minutes. 
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the  
 

total quantity of water delivered to the agglomerate is up to 
10% by weight, preferably 3 to 6% by weight. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that PVC, polyamide, PES waste containing 

woven or non-woven fabric, paper-contaminated or other 
contaminated plastic waste is used as starting materials. 
Use of the agglomerate produced according to one of the 
preceding claims for the production of plastic films which 

contain up to 100% of this agglomerate.
