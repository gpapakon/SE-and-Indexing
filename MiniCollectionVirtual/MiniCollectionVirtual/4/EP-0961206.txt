<ABSTRACT>
An input/output driver circuit which provides a buffer
interface between a functional digital circuit (14) and a

common bus (18) for other digital circuits achieves high
levels of voltage tolerance and compliance, while requiring

only two power supply pins (38,42), by using two PMOS
switching transistors (T1A,T1B) between the circuit's output

line (30) and an output power supply terminal(42),
rather than only one. To turn the transistors OFF, the

output power supply (40) voltage is applied to the gate of
one of them and the output line voltage to the gate of the

other. This assures that at least one of the transistors
is fully OFF when desired, whether or not the output line

voltage exceeds the output power supply level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to driver circuits which provide a digital input/output interface, and more particularly to driver circuits that can tolerate voltages greater than their power supplies and can produce outputs at voltage levels different from their internal operating voltages.Input and output buffer circuits are commonly used to interface between multiple digital circuits such as memory and DSP (digital signal processing) chips. The buffer driver circuits are often subjected to multiple voltage levels. For example, a driver circuit that is designed to produce a 3.3 volt output, and thus operates from a 3.3 volt output power supply, may receive 5 volt signals if it is connected to a bus that receives 5 volt outputs from other chips. This may result, for example, from the two chips using different types of logic families. Furthermore, the drivers commonly have input and output stages that operate off of separate power supplies, with the input stage isolated from the output power supply to protect it from the output switching noise. The input power supply level may either be the same as or different from the output power supply level, depending upon the application.Two characteristics that are desirable in a driver circuit of this type are tolerance and compliance. "Tolerance" refers to an ability to withstand voltages greater than the power supply level. For example, a driver that had a 3.3 volt output power supply and could tolerate 5 volts received from a common bus would be said to have a 5 volt tolerance (or whatever greater voltage level it could withstand). "Compliance" refers to the ability to produce a higher voltage on the driver's output than the power supply level used for the main portion of the driver circuitry. A compliance to a higher voltage generally requires that the driver's output power supply be at the higher voltage. For example, a driver with a 3.3 volt input power supply but a 5 volt output power supply capable of producing 5 volt outputs would be said to be compliant to 5 volts.Higher output than input power supplies are commonly used to bias input protection circuitry, resulting in a tolerance up to the output power supply level (plus about 0.3 volts). However, the user may elect to set the output power supply equal to the input power supply level, perhaps because the only power supply available to the user is at the input power supply level, or because other circuits connected to the common bus could not withstand higher voltages being driven onto the bus. In such a case
