<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to o-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines, to a process for the
preparation of these compounds, to the use of said compounds as stabilisers for organic
polymers, and to the polymer stabilised with said compounds.Hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines that carry at least two o-hydroxyphenyl substituents are known,
inter alia, from Helv. Chim. Act. 55(1), 1566-1595 (1972). The shortcoming of these
compounds, is however, that their maximum absorption spectra are of relatively long
wavelength and they therefore normally have an undesirable inherent colour.Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain s-triazines that have only one o-hydroxy
function have a maximum absorption spectrum of substantially shorter wavelength. Such
compounds are better able to absorb in particular energy-rich radiation and, because of
their insignificant inherent colour, are suitable for use as UV stabilisers in synthetic
materials and resins, especially polyesters.Accordingly, the present invention relates to o-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines of formula

wherein
Y is hydrogen or C1-C18alkoxy and Z is C1-C18alkoxy, 
and the compound 2-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-6-phenyl-s-triazine.C1-C18alkoxy are straight-chain or branched alkoxy, typically including methoxy, ethoxy,
propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy, isooctyloxy, nonyloxy,
undecyloxy, dodecyloxy, tetradecyloxy, pentadecyloxy, hexadecyloxy, heptadecyloxy or
octadecyloxy.Suitable compounds of formula (1) are preferably those in which both Y and Z are
C1-C12alkoxy.Particularly preferred triazines are those wherein Y and Z are C1-C4alkoxy.Further interesting compounds of formula (1) are those wherein
Y is C1-C12alkoxy, and
Z is hydrogen.Illustrative examples of the invention are:
2-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-6-phenyl-s-triazine2-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-6-phenyl-s-triazine2,4-bis(2'-methoxyphenyl)-6-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-s-triazineThe compounds of formula (1) may conveniently be prepared by selective alkylation of
the hydroxy groups of corresponding triazines. The starting compounds must contain at
least two hydroxyl groups. This process is novel and constitutes a further object of the
invention. The process for the preparation of the triazines of formula (1) comprises
selectively alkylating a hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine of formula 

wherein
Y1 and Z1 are each independently of the other hydrogen or hydroxy, with the proviso that
at least one of Y1 and Z1 is hydroxy, with an alkylating reagent.Suitable alkylating reagents
