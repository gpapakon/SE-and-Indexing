<ABSTRACT>
A device for adjusting the oblique register in clamping apparatus for tensioning printing plates in an offset printing machine, in which a clamping rail is aligned on the outer surface of the plate cylinder parallel to the cylinder axis using means for opening and closing a gap for inserting the leading or trailing edge of a printing plate, and in which a centring bolt is fixed, which is aligned radially to the plate cylinder, extends into the insertion gap, and whose profile corresponds to the profile of a centring groove in the insertion edge of the printing plate, characterised in that the centring bolt is fixed in the one outer edge region of the clamping apparatus, in that a stop aligned in the circumferential direction of the plate cylinder is produced to be adjustable in the circumferential direction of the plate cylinder in the insertion gap in the other edge region of the clamping apparatus, and in that at least one adjusting means is arranged on the plate clamping apparatus to adjust the position of the stop.

Arrangement for adjusting the diagonal register
in a clamping arrangement for clamping printing plates

(1) in an offset printing machine, in which a clamping
strip with means for opening and closing a gap for

inserting and securing the front or rear edge of a
printing plate is aligned parallel to the cylinder axis

on the surface of the plate cylinder (4), and in which
centring bolts (2, 3) arranged radially in relation to

the plate cylinder in each case in the outer edge region
of the clamping arrangement and reaching into the insertion

gap are fastened, the profile of which corresponds
to the profile of a centring groove in the insertion edge

of the printing plate, one centring bolt (2) being
fastened permanently, characterized in that the other

centring bolt is designed as an alignable stop (3) and is
mounted adjustably in the circumferential direction of

the plate cylinder (4), in that an adjusting means (9) is
provided for adjusting the circumferential position of

the stop (3), which adjusting means is arranged on the
plate-clamping arrangement or in the plate cylinder, and

Claim 1, characterized in that the stop is of

rotationally symmetrical design, that the stop is mounted
rotatably about its axis of symmetry in the clamping

arrangement, that corresponding deflecting elements are
provided on the stop and on the clamping arrangement for 

deflecting the rotary movement of the stop into a
translatory movement in the insertion direction of the

plate.
