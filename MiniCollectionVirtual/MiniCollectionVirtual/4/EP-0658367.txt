<ABSTRACT>
Oxygen is separated from air by means of a high temperature ion 
transport membrane which is integrated with a gas turbine system for energy 

recovery from the membrane nonpermeate stream. Air is compressed, heated 
in a first heating step, and passed through the feed side of a mixed 

conductor membrane zone to produce a high purity oxygen product on the 
permeate side of the membrane zone. Nonpermeate gas from the membrane zone 

is heated in a second heating step and passed through a hot gas turbine for 
power recovery. The operating temperatures of the membrane zone and the 

expansion turbine are independently maintained by controlling the rate of 
heat addition in the first and second heating steps, whereby the membrane 

zone and expansion turbine are thermally delinked for maximum oxygen 
recovery efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the recovery of oxygen by a high temperature ion transport membrane system, and in particular
to heat integration of a mixed conductor membrane system with a hot gas expansion turbine.Oxygen is an economically important gas which is widely used in large-scale industrial applications. New uses for
oxygen are emerging in advanced high-temperature processes for iron and steel manufacture, coal gasification, oxygen-enriched
combustion, and in particular integrated gasification combined cycle power generation. In these large-scale
applications, the cost of oxygen produced by conventional cryogenic or noncryogenic technology is a major portion
of the overall operating cost, and lower oxygen cost will encourage the commercialization of these emerging technologies.
New oxygen separation processes which can be thermally integrated with these advanced high-temperature
processes will reduce the energy consumed in oxygen production, which in turn will promote the technical and commercial
development of such integrated systems.Oxygen can be recovered from air at high temperatures by inorganic oxide ceramic materials utilized in the form of
selectively permeable nonporous ion transport membranes. An oxygen partial pressure differential or a voltage differential
across the membrane causes oxygen ions to migrate through the membrane from the feed side to the permeate
side where the ions recombine to form electrons and oxygen gas. An ion transport membrane of the pressure-driven
type is defined herein as a mixed conductor membrane, in which the electrons simultaneously migrate through the
membrane to preserve internal electrical neutrality. An ion transport membrane of the electrically-driven type is defined
herein as a solid electrolyte membrane in which the electrons flow from the permeate side to the feed side of the membrane
in an external circuit driven by a voltage differential. A comprehensive review of the characteristics and applications
of ion transport membranes is given in report entitled "Advanced Oxygen Separation Membranes" by J. D. Wright
and R. J. Copeland, Report No. TDA-GRI-90/0303 prepared for the Gas Research Institute, September 1990.In the recovery of oxygen from air at high temperatures (typically 700°C to 1100°C) using ion transport membranes,
a significant amount of heat energy is available in the membrane permeate and non-permeate streams. The effective
use of this energy in the overall operation of an ion transport membrane system is necessary if the system is to be
