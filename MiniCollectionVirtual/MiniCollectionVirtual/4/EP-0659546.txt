<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for adjusting bottom-dead-center 
position of a slide in mechanical press including a connecting 

rod 4 connected to a crank shaft 3, and a hydraulic 
cylinder 15 provided between the connecting rod 4 and a 

slide 5. The hydraulic cylinder 15 has a piston rod 16 
having one end connected to the connecting rod 4, a cylinder 

body 17 capable of moving relative to the piston rod 
16, a hydraulic chamber 27 formed below a piston portion 

16A, and a pressure adjusting means 45 connected to this 
hydraulic chamber 27. An extending member 19 for connecting 

the connecting rod and the cylinder body is fitted 
around an outer periphery of the piston rod 16, and the 

adjustment of the bottom-dead-center position of the slide 
can be effected as the extending member 19 is extended by 

the adjustment of hydraulic pressure within the hydraulic 
chamber 27.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
adjusting B.D.C.position (bottom-dead-center position) of a 
slide in an apparatus for a mechanical press. In cases where a material is punched with a punch 
and a die, it is necessary to effect punching by maintaining 
an accurate bottom-dead-center position of a slide so 
as to prolong the life of the punch and the die. In cases 
where coining is effected in which a material is compressed 
by the punch and the die, or scoring is effected in which 
the material is marked with notches and incisions, an 
additional load due to the contacting of the slide against 
a stopper block occurs in a mechanical press in addition to 
a working load. Because of this, it is conducted to accurately 
control the penetration of the punch into the material 
and the thickness of a remaining portion of the material 
when the slide which has approached a bolster is 
brought into contact with the stopper block. When a press 
operation is started, the temperatures of members such as  
 
connecting rods which connect a crank shaft and the slide 
increase due to the motion, and such members undergo thermal 
expansion. Since the temperature rise is not uniform 
depending on the members, in the case of punching, the 
bottom-dead-center position of the slide is offset downward 
from an accurate position. Also, in the cases of coining 
and scoring, the additional load due to the stopper block 
increases, so that a large press load is generated during 
press working. To overcome the above problem, a method in which 
temperature-controlled oil is applied to the connecting 
rods (Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 
30569/1989), and the use of an adjusting screw mechanism 
for adjusting the die height are conventionally known. With the conventional technique in which temperature-controlled 
oil is applied to the connecting rods, an 
apparatus for adjusting the oil temperature is required. It 
is very difficult to adjust the length of the connecting 
rods accurately by the temperature-controlled oil, thereby 
making it virtually difficult to obtain a predetermined 
bottom-dead-center position of the slide. With the conventional 
technique using the die-height adjusting screw 
mechanism, an adjustment screw for eliminating the looseness 
of the adjusting screw during a press operation must  
 
be locked with a lock nut, and during the die height adjustment, 
the die height adjustment must be made after the 
lock of the lock nut is released, and then the lock must be 
provided

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for adjusting bottom-dead-center position 
of a slide in mechanical press including a connecting 

rod (4) connected to a crank shaft (3), and a slide (5) connected to 
said connecting rod (4) by means of a hydraulic cylinder (15), 

wherein:
 
   said hydraulic cylinder has a piston rod (16), one end of 

which is connected to said connecting rod (4) by means of a 
plunger (13), a cylinder body (17) connected to said slide (5) and provided 

in such a manner as to be movable relative to said 
piston rod (16), and a hydraulic chamber (27) provided below said 

piston rod (16), pressure oil adjusted by means of a pressure 
adjusting means (45) capable of being supplied to and discharged 

from said hydraulic chamber (27); and an extending member (19) having 
one end connected to said connecting rod by means of said 

plunger (13) and another end connected to said cylinder body (17) is 
fitted around an outer periphery of said piston rod (16), said 

extending member (19) being provided in such a manner as to be 
capable of being extended by the adjustment of hydraulic 

pressure within said hydraulic chamber (27). 
The apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein a bottom-dead-center 
position of said slide (5) is corrected by 

adjusting the hydraulic pressure within said hydraulic 
chamber (27) by means of said pressure adjusting means (45).  

 
The apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said 
pressure adjusting means (45) includes a pressure adjusting 

valve (39) connected to said hydraulic chamber and a 
bottom-dead-center position detecting means (11) provided in a 

vicinity of said slide (5) and is provided in such a manner as 
to be capable of outputting a value of a detected bottom-dead-center 

position each time said slide (5) undergoes upward 
and downward motion, and wherein said pressure adjusting 

valve (39) maintains the accuracy of the bottom-dead-center 
position of said slide (5) as said pressure adjusting valve (39) is 

changed over on the basis of a difference between the 
output value of said bottom-dead-center position detecting 

means (11) and a predetermined set value.
