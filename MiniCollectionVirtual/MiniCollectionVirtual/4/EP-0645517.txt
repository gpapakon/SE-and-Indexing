<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a door consisting of a door 
sheet and jambs and jamb-linings pertaining thereto, and 

which are to be fitted in a wall opening, characterized 
in that said jamb has at least on the side of the pivot 

axis (X) a continuous bowl-shaped cavity (2) directed 
towards the door sheet (4) and wherein the concerned 

edge of the door sheet (4) fits, which bowl-shaped 
cavity (2) has a radius which is substantially equal to 

the distance between the centre line of the pivot axis 
(X) of the door sheet and said edge of the door sheet 

(4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a door consisting of a door
sheet and jambs and jamb-linings pertaining thereto, and which are to be
fitted in a wall opening, the pivot axis of the door sheet being situated on a
distance from a first jamb which extends in vertical direction against a first
side of the wall opening and comprises a first continuous open recess with
a bowl-shaped cross section directed towards the door sheet for receiving a
first vertical edge of the door sheet, whereby the radius of the first recess is
substantially equal to the distance between the centre line of the pivot axis
of the door sheet and the first vertical edge of said door sheet, whereby a
first abutment is removably mounted into the continuous open recess, and
the door sheet further comprises a second bumper to be received by a
second abutment which is removably mounted into said jamb.It has already been proposed to hinge a window or door
sheet on one of its vertical edges with its extremity on an arc-shaped cavity
of a jamb for a window or a door. Examples of such solutions can be found
in the following documents: DE 87 127, DE 27 25 159 and LU 36 870.In US-A-3,827,183 a centre-hung pivot door assembly is
disclosed which substantially eliminates the hazard of damage to fingers
being caught in the door and which at the same time is weather resistant.
The door assembly disclosed in US-A-3,827,183 comprises at least one
door pivotally mounted in a door frame, the latter comprising parallel pivot
and strike jambs, the door comprising parallel pivot and lock stiles. Along
substantially the entire length of the pivot jamb, a concave jamb projection
member which projets into the door opening is attached. In the door frame,
in closely spaced relation with the jamb projection an arcuate-shaped pivot 
stile is mounted. A resilient weather seal spans the gap between the pivot
stile and the pivot jamb. The space between the jamb projection and the
pivot stile always being less than the thickness of human fingers. On the
outer edge of the lock stile of the door a resilient, arcuate edge guard is
mounted, the width of which is greater than the thickness of human fingers,
so that an adult can grasp the door when it is closed. Because of the
resilience of the guard, the risk to pinching of the fingers between door and
jamb is eliminated. Into the strike jamb a resilient weather strip is mounted
which span the gap between the edge guard and the door jamb, to ensure
weather resistance.A particular object of the invention is to prescribe a door
hav

<CLAIMS>
A door assembly consisting of a door sheet
(4), jambs (1) and jamb-linings (29) which are to be fitted in a wall opening

pertaining thereto, the pivot axis (x) of the door sheet (4) being situated on
a distance from a first jamb (33) which extends in vertical direction against

a first side of the wall opening and comprises a first continuous open
recess (2) with a bowl-shaped cross section directed towards the door

sheet (4) for receiving a first vertical edge of the door sheet (4), the radius
of the first recess (2) being substantially equal to the distance between the

centre line of the pivot axis (x) of the door sheet (4) and the first vertical
