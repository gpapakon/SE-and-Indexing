<DESCRIPTION>
 Additives and Fuel CompositionsThis invention relates to the use of additives for improving the cold flow properties of crude oil, lubricating oil or fuel oil, for example distillate petroleum fuel such as middle distillate fuel oil boiling within the range of 110°C to 500°C.When oils and fuel oils are subjected to low ambient temperatures, wax may separate out from the fuel and impair the flow properties of the oil. For example, middle distillate fuels contain wax which precipitates at low temperatures to form large waxy crystals which tend to plug the small pore openings of fuel filters. This problem is particularly acute when the fuel is a diesel fuel because the nominal apertures in the fuel filter of diesel engines are typically of diameter between about 5 and 50 microns. Additives are known in the art for overcoming the above problem and are called Flow Improvers.Such additives may act as wax crystal modifiers when blended with waxy mineral oil by modifying the shape and size of crystals of the wax therein and reducing the adhesive forces between the crystals and between the wax and the oil to permit the oil to remain fluid at a lower temperature than in the absence of the additive.EP-A-0 261 957 describes the use of additives for improving the cold flow properties of distillate fuels, and exemplifies an additive (designated Additive C therein) comprising the reaction product of one mole of phthalic anhydride with two moles of dihydrogenated tallow amine, to form a half amide/half amine salt, in combination with an additive (designated Additives A therein) comprising an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer or a mixture of two ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers. Specific examples of Additives A used with Additive C in EP-A-0 261 957 are:Additive A1 , which is a 1 :3 (w/w) mixture of two copolymers, one being A2 as defined below and the other being A3 as defined below. Thus, the average vinyl acetate content of A1 is 32.75 wt%, i.e. 13.7 mole%;Additive A2, which is a copolymer consisting of ethylene and about 17 wt% vinyl acetate and having an Mn of about 3000 as measured by Vapour Phase Osmometry (VPO), i.e. 6.25 mole% of vinyl acetate; 

Additive A3, which is a copolymer consisting of ethylene and about 38 wt% vinyl acetate and having an Mn of about 1800 as measured by VPO, i.e. 16.6 mole% of vinyl acetate; andAdditive A4, which is a 50:50 mixture of Additives A2 and A3 as defined above, the average vinyl acetate content of A4 therefore being 27.5 wt%, i.e. 1 1 mole%.Mn in this specification is the
