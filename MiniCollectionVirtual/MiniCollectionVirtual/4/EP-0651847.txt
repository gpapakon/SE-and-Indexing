<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a label that can be attached
easily and fast to garments or cloth, or any other product,
which have to be protected, and which label can be removed
easily and fast by personnel, without traces or damage. The
label is reusable.The label has several embodiments and corresponding uses:
1. The label as ordinary label, without further built-in
equipment;2. The label provided with equipment, which in conjunction
with further equipment brings about an alarm signal
when the label, thus with stolen garments, threatens to
leave the shop; for example, a coil in conjunction with
an antenna near the exit;3. the label can be attached to a secured chain;4. the label is provided with a capsule with ink or acid,
which bursts when the thief tries to detach the label.A well assorted shop will prefer a combination. For
example, with underpants type 1, with sweaters type 2, with
leather coats type 3, on garments displayed outside type 4.Many security labels are known and come with their specific
draw-backs. Existing labels are produced as type 2, type 4,
or a combination of type 2 and type 4.It is important that security labels when attached to
garments, can carry the weight of a chain, at least without
tearing the cloth. Furthermore, security labels must be
strong enough to resist, once stolen, the manual power of
the shoplifter. The label provided with a coil has become a classic. One
member of the label contains a 1.2 mm thick pin, the other
member of the label comprises a hole, in which the pin is
clasped by a jaw mechanism. The pin punctures the garment.
Such label can be shielded with aluminium foil which
prevents detection and putting the alarm equipment into
action. Two labels flat against each other also prevent
detection.Labels exclusively with ink should serve a precautionary
purpose. It turned out that this does not always work, or
only for cheap articles which are roughly as expensive as
the label itself. Several labels comprise a combination of
ink and signalization. The label of Custavsson US patent
4.483.049, with a built-in coil according to Heaton US
patent 4.649.397, has the following draw-backs: It can only
be attached to the edge of the cloth and may, consequently,
be cut out easily. It takes new personnel one day to learn
how to unlock this label. It can be shielded from detection
manually. It is expensive.Hogan's label US patent 5.054.172 has some drawbacks. The
pin is rough and may puncture thin cloth. When a shoplifter
unfamiliar with this label tries to remove the label,

<CLAIMS>
A device for temporary attachment to goods having flexible material (2) for the
protection thereof against theft, comprising a first part (3, 40) and a second part (1,

32) which are adapted for clamping there-between a layer of the flexible material of
the good, said first part (3, 40) having a side (24) with a recess (27) formed therein,

said second part (1, 32) being complementary to said recess (27) of said first part (3,
40) and adapted to be inserted in said recess (27), said recess (27) of said first part

(3, 40) being bounded laterally by undercut rigid side walls, said recess (27) and said
second part (1, 32) being additionally provided with locking means (5, 8, 29, 30) for

mechanically locking said second part (1, 32) in said recess (27) of said first part (3,
40) with the layer of material (2) clasped in between, whereby said second part (1,

32) is blocked against movement out of said recess (27), said locking means being
releasable only by an adapted unlocking means such as a strong magnet (12) or an

airgun (9a).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said first part (3, 40) is
substantially flat and said recess (27) has a wedge shape as seen parallel to said flat

side.
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that said second part (1,
32) is adapted to be inserted slidably in said recess of said first part by a linear

movement of said second part (1, 32) parallel to the clasped layer of material.
A device according one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said locking means
comprise a protrusion (16, 30) 
formed on said second part (1, 32) and an indentation
(29) formed in said recess (27).
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that said indentation and said
protrusion (16) are formed such that said second part (1) can be locked in said

recess at a plurality of positions relative to said first part (3).
