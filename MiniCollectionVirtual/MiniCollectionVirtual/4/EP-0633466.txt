<ABSTRACT>
A bulk material analyzer assembly (10) of the type in which the bulk material is 
transported through the material analyzer assembly on a conveyor belt (68) between at 

least one radiation source (33) and at least one radiation detector (37), includes a plurality 
of lower modules (11, 14, 16, 22, 24) and upper modules (12, 18, 20, 26, 28) that contain 

radiation shielding material (30, 34, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54) and are so shaped as to 
define a passageway (38) for the conveyor belt between the upper module
s and the lower 
modules when the upper modules are placed on the lower modules. A primary centrally 

located lower module (11) also includes the radiation sources (33) and a primary centrally 
located upper module (12) also includes the radiation detectors (37). Some of the 

outwardly located modules contain less radiation shielding material. The radiation 
shielding material includes a plurality of personally portable blocks. The conveyor belt is 

supported by compressed air passed through apertures (72) in central upper walls (73) in 
the outwardly located lower modules. The lower modules contain alignment members 

(84) on upward facing surfaces thereof and the upper modules contain alignment members 
on downward facing surfaces thereof that are complementary to the alignment members 

on the upward facing surfaces in order to enable the upper modules to be accurately 
placed on the lower modules. The lower modules each include a central upper wall 

bounded by outwardly inclined inner side walls (78) to define a trough for accommodating 
passage through the passageway of a conveyor belt having a contour corresponding to the 

trough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to bulk material analyzers and is
particularly directed to an improved assembly for bulk material analyzers of the type in
which bulk material is transported through the assembly on a conveyor belt between at
least one radiation source and at least one radiation detector.Bulk material analyzers are used to measure the elemental content of bulk
materials. In one type of bulk material analyzer, the radiation source includes one or more
neutron sources and the radiation detector includes one or more gamma-ray detectors that
produce signals which are processed to provide a measurement of the elemental content of
the bulk material. When the bulk material is bombarded by neutrons, secondary emissions
of gamma-rays are produced from the bulk material. Different characteristic gamma-ray
energy spectra are produced from different elements in the bulk material. By processing
detected signals that are indicative of the gamma-ray spectrum a measurement is provided
of the elemental content of the bulk material. This measurement process is known in the
art as prompt gamma-ray neutron activation analysis (PGNAA). In addition to containing
the radiation source and the radiation detector, the bulk material analyzer assembly
necessarily includes a large quantity of radiation shielding material in order to protect
persons using the bulk material analyzer from harmful dosages of radiation. The required
quantity of radiation shielding material is such that the bulk material analyzer assembly is
so large that the assembly is not easily handled for transportation from one site to another.
A prior bulk material analyzer is disclosed in US-A-4028267.The present invention provides an improved assembly for a bulk material analyzer
of the type in which bulk matenal is transported through the assembly on a conveyor belt
between at least one radiation source and at least one radiation detector, said assembly
comprising container means defining at least one radiation source cavity, at least one
radiation detector cavity and a passageway disposed for enabling passage of a conveyor
belt between the at least one radiation source cavity and the at least one radiation detector
cavity; and radiation shielding material disposed within the container means; wherein the
container means include a lower pnmary module containing a first portion of the radiation
shielding material and defining either said at least one radiation source cavity or said at 
least one radiation detector cavity; an upper primary
