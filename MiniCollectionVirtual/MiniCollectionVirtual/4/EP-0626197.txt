Process for discharging a powder from a reactor containing both a powder
and a gas under pressure, by means of a device including a densification zone in which

the volume available for the powder is decreased without, however, compacting it and
which consists of at least one Archimedes' screw arranged in a barrel and exhibiting a

decrease in the screw pitch and/or a gradual increase in the diameter of the shaft of the
screw.
Process according to Claim 1, applied to the discharging of a reactor in
which one of the reactants is in gaseous phase.
Process for discharging according to any one of Claims 1 to 2, applied to the
discharging of a fluidized bed reactor.

phase polymerization of α-olefins containing from 2 to 22 carbon atoms.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
densification of the powder is accompanied by a decrease in the quantity of gaseous

phase originating from the reactor.
Process according to either of Claims 1 or 7, characterized in that the
densification zone consists of two co- or counterrotating
 screws.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in that the two screws are
corotating. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the
powder is next dedensified in a dedensification zone containing an inert gas at a

pressure higher than the pressure prevailing in the reactor and in which the volume
available for the powder is increased while the powder being diluted with an inert gas.
Process according to Claim 10, characterized in that the densification and
the dedensification of the powder are performed in a single volume including a

densification zone and a dedensification zone which are or are not distinct from one
another.

dedensification zone consists of one or more Archimedes' screws arranged in one or

more barrels maintained under pressure by an inert gas.
Process according to Claim 12, characterized in that the discharging of the
powder is carried out by means of a device consisting of a barrel containihg two

corotating screws which have a first zone of densification in which the pitch of the
screws is decreased, followed by a second zone of dedensification in which the pitch of

these screws is increased while the inert gas is introduced through a side pipe.
Process according to any one of Claims 10 to 13, characterized in that it
contains several sequences of densification and of dedensification.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 14, comprising the final
discharging of the reactor in a terminal zone.
