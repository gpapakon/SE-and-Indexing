<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machining method and device, especially a grinding machine, comprising a bed (14) on which two work surfaces (A, B) are shaped, at least two oscillating elements (11, 12) located on one of the work surfaces (A, B), each of the said oscillating elements (11, 12) comprising at least one first tooling member (15, 16), at least one second tooling member (15, 16) being located on the other work surface (A, B), at least one means (20) for generating an oscillating movement allowing a to-and-fro movement to be generated at each of the said oscillating elements (11, 12) so that the result of the vectors representing the dynamic forces associated with displacement of each of the said oscillating elements (11, 12) is substantially equal to zero value; the induced vibration is therefore non-existent or minimal.
