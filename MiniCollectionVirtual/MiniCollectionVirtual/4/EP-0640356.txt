<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (2) which supplies breathing 
gas mixed with an additive gas to a patient for pulmonary 

diagnosis or pulmonary treatment. The device (2) comprises 
a gas mixing unit (4) through which a relatively 

large flow of breathing gas is achieved from a first gas 
source (6) through a first pressure regulator (8) and a 

second pressure regulator (10). The breathing gas passes 
through a connecting tube (24) from which the patient can 

breathe spontaneously through an inspiration tube (26), 
thereby inhaling air from the connecting tube (24). Expired 

gas passes via an expiration tube (36) to the connecting 
tube (24). Additive gas is supplied from a separate gas 

source (16) via a second pressure regulator (18) and a second 
flow regulator (20). The additive gas is supplied in a 

flow which is considerably smaller than the flow of breathing 
gas, whereby a very small but accurate concentration of 

the additive gas can be achieved in the breathing gas. The 
large flow prevents a reactive additive gas from reacting 

before being supplied to the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for supplying a 
breathing gas containing a predetermined concentration of a 
specific additive gas to the lungs of a living creature, 
comprising an inspiration tube through which breathing gas 
and additive gas are delivered to the lungs, an expiration 
tube through which expired gas is carried away from the 
lungs, a first adjustable gas source for supplying breathing 
gas to the inspiration tube and a second adjustable gas 
source for supplying at least the additive gas to the inspiration 
tube. In the diagnosis of pulmonary function and treatment of the 
lungs, having a patient spontaneously breathe a breathing 
gas containing a predetermined concentration of a specific 
additive gas nay be appropriate. The additive gas could be 
e.g. nitric oxide, NO, nitrous oxide N₂O, or sulphur 
hexafluoride, SF₆. For example, NO could be used for relaxing 
the smooth muscle in blood vessels and bronchi or for 
determining the diffusion capacity of the lungs. N₂O can be 
used for determining the blood's rate of flow through the 
lungs, and SF₆ could be used for determining the functional 
residual capacity (FRC) of the lungs. Measurement of pulmonary 
pressure also supplies a measure of the resistance to 
flow through the lungs. Certain additive gases, such as NO, react strongly with e.g. 
oxygen and must therefore be added to breathing gas close to 
the patient so the additive gas is fed down into the lungs 
without having time to combine chemically with oxygen and 
form NO₂. In order to simplify the supplying of small 
amounts, one or two ppm, of an additive gas, the additive 
gas is usually mixed with some other gas, such as N₂, in a 
higher concentration, e.g. 100 ppm. This gas mixture is then  
 
added to the flow of breathing gas at a flow rate which is a 
predetermined fraction of the flow of breathing gas in order 
to produce the correct concentration. So gas is supplied in 
two stages. In a European patent application no. 92108636.9 is described 
a ventilator which can control very small flows. An accurate 
concentration of NO or some other additive gas can be delivered 
to a patient's lungs with such a ventilator. However, 
the ventilator is complex. One object of the invention is to achieve a device which can 
supply a breathing gas containing a specific additive gas to 
the lungs, simply and reliably, in such a way that active 
additive gases do not have time to react with other gases 
before passing down into the lungs. The object is achieved with a device
