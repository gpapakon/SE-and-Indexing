<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a building for testing aircraft engines, particularly of propeller type, and comprising vertical walls and a roof which on a ground surface (2) delimit a closed test hall (3) in which the aircraft (4), the engine or engines (5) of which are to be tested, is adapted to be parked and with air inlet and outlet ducts (6, 7) provided with silencing baffles (8) and extending substantially horizontally forwardly and rearwardly of the parked aircraft (4), respectively, and which have an adjoining inlet and outlet portion (6a, 7a), respectively, which is directed substantially vertically. In order to provide that the airflows in the test hall effectively are taken care of and a laminary and stable airflow might be maintained, it is suggested according to the invention that the air outlet duct (7) has diffusor shape in its portion located closest to the test hall (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a building for 
ground testing of aircraft engines, particularly of turboprop 
type, and comprising vertical walls and a roof, which 
on a ground surface delimit a closed test hall, in which 
the aircraft is to be placed, the engine or engines of 
which is/are to be tested, and air inlet and outlet ducts 
equipped with silencing baffles and extending substantially 
horizontally forwardly and rearwardly of the parked 
aircraft, respectively, and which have an adjoining inlet 
and outlet portion, respectively, directed in substantially 
vertical direction. Ground testing of aircrafts most often is made 
outdoors and in unprotected environment. In doing so problems 
arise particularly in the form of noise which is 
disturbing to surrounding houses and the ever-increasing 
environment requirements therefore have led to a frequent 
location of the aircraft engine testing places at great 
distance from the workshops and other facilities at the 
airports. In its turn this requires extensive and time-consuming 
transports which constitute a basic problem 
which possibly could be solved by means of a suitable 
testing building. Such testing buildings have been utilized 
to a small extent in connection with military aircrafts 
with turbojet engines but due to the concentrated 
character of the jets it is relatively simple to collect 
and cool such jets and damp the noise therefrom. In propeller-driven aircrafts the situation is 
different in that substantial technical difficulties have 
to be overcome which are associated with the great air 
flows which are difficult to control and occur in a limited 
test hall due to the great air volumes which furthermore 
varies from one operational case to another. Said air 
flows might give rise to sound amplifications in the form 
of acoustic resonances which influence on the aircraft in 
the form of vibrations. In order to avoid a re-circulation  
 
of air flows in the test hall the under-atmospheric pressure 
therein ought not to exceed 20 mm water column. Behind 
an aircraft propeller a helical air flow with low 
speed occurs which "circulates" in the test hall. Now, the object of the present invention is to 
provide a testing building in which the air flows in the 
test hall can be effectively taken care of and a laminary 
and stable air flow can be maintained. This is obtained 
according to the invention substantially in that the air 
outlet duct in its portion closest to the testing hall has 
diffusor shape. With the invention an

A testing building for testing aircraft engines, 
particularly of propeller type, and comprising vertical 

walls and a roof, which on a ground surface (2) delimit a 
closed test hall (3), in which the aircraft (4) is to be 

placed, the engine or engines of which is/are to be tested, 
and air inlet and outlet ducts (6, 7), which are 

equipped with silencing baffles (8) and which extend substantially 
horizontally forwardly and rearwardly of the 

parked aircraft (4), respectively, and which have an adjoining 
inlet and outlet portion (6a, 7a), respectively, 

directed in substantially vertical direction, 
characterized 
in
 that the air outlet duct (7) in its 
portion closest to the testing hall (3) has diffusor 

shape. 
A testing building according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that in the diffusor-shaped air 
outlet portion (7d) are mounted suction fans (10) acting 

transversely to the outlet direction. 
A testing building according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that interior of the walls 
and roof are mounted protruding guide wall panels or portions 

(12) in order to prevent a re-circulation of air 
possibly contaminated with engine exhaust gases. 
A testing building according to claim 3, 
characterized in
 that the guide wall panels (12) 
are mounted at positions in the lengthwise direction of 

the hall 3 which lie behind the engine or engines (5) of 
the parked aircraft.
