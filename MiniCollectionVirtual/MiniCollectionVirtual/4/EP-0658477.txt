<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structure with several adjacent seats of a public transport vehicle, particularly an airliner, which is convertible and of variable size along a sliding axis (100), comprising:   - a fixed part (2) of longitudinal underframe elements (5), with overall axis parallel to the sliding axis; - at least one moving part (3) comprising an end transverse seating face (6) rigidly combined with longitudinal support elements (7), and intermediate transverse seating faces (8) parallel to the end transverse seating face (6) and associated with the longitudinal support elements (7); and   - means of locking the moving part (3) onto the fixed part (2) characterised in that each longitudinal underframe element (5) comprises at least two slider elements (9) integral with the longitudinal underframe element (5), in which a longitudinal support element (7) of the moving part (3) slides and is guided in translation along the sliding axis (100).

A structure comprising a plurality of adjacent seats for a public 
passenger vehicle, in particular an airliner, the structure being 

convertible and of variable size along a sliding axis (100), and 
comprising: 


a fixed portion (2) comprising at least two transverse 
underframes (4) that are spaced apart from each other, fixed to the 

floor of the passenger cabin, and rigidly connected to one another by 
longitudinal underframe elements (5) having an axis that is generally 

parallel to the sliding axis; 
at least one moving portion (3) that is movable relative to the 
fixed portion between two extreme positions, namely a maximum-size 

first position and a minimum-size second position, said moving 
portion (3) including an end transverse seat side member (6) rigidly 

associated with longitudinal support elements (7), and intermediate 
transverse seat side members (8) parallel to the end transverse seat 

side member (6) and associated with the longitudinal support elements 
(6), and serving to mount seat backs and arms; and 
locking means for locking the moving portion (3) to the fixed 
portion (2) in each of the two extreme positions; 
the structure being characterized in that each longitudinal 
underframe element (5) includes at least two sliding support elements 

(9) secured to the longitudinal underframe element (5) for sliding 
along an axis that is parallel to and distinct from the general axis 

of the associated longitudinal underframe element (5), with one of 
the longitudinal support elements (7) of the moving portion (3) being 

slidably received therein and guided in translation along the sliding 
axis (100). 
A structure according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
intermediate transverse seat
 side members (8) are slidable relative 
to the support elements (7) with which they are associated. 
A structure according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
support elements (7) include driving abutments disposed at 

predetermined locations for driving said intermediate transverse seat 
side members (8) in translation along the sliding axis (100) over a  

 
previously-chosen distance that is not necessarily the same as the 

displacement distance of the moving portion (3). 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the locking means comprising abutment means for limiting 

sliding motion between the two extreme positions, and safety means 
for locking the moving portion (3) in each of the two extreme 

positions. 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that one of the end transverse seat side members (10) is rigidly 

associated with the longitudinal underframe elements (5) so that only 
one of the seat ends (6) is movable. 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that each of the end transverse seat side members (6) is rigidly 

associated with a moving portion (3), each of the two seat ends (10) 
being movable independently of the other. 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the safety means for locking the moving portion (3) in either 

extreme position comprise a manual actuator device that is made safe 
by being retained by the structure unless it has been properly locked 

in position against translation. 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that at least one of the longitudinal support elements (7) of each 

moving portion (3) is hollow, and in that the safety means comprise a 
rod (11) coaxially mounted inside the hollow support element (7), 

free to rotate about the axis of said support, opening out to one of 
its ends (16) in the outside face (12) of the end transverse seat 

side member (6), and having a cam (13) at its other end (15), two 
grooves (14a, 14b) being provided in the associated underframe 

element (5) in such a manner that when the cam (13) is in the first 
position it co-operates with the first groove (14b) to lock the 

moving portion (3) in translation, and when the cam is in its second 
position it co-operates with the second groove (14a), changeover  

 
between the two positions being achieved firstly by rotating the rod 

(11) so as to disengage the cam from one of the grooves (14a, 14b); 
then by sliding the moving portion (3) towards the other position; 

and then by rotating the rod (11) in the opposite direction to engage 
the cam (13) in the other groove (14a, 14b). 
A structure according to claim 8, characterized in that the end 
(16) opening out in the outside face (12) of the end transverse seat 

side member (6) has an axial safety lock (17) designed to co-operate 
with the removable manual actuator device (18) that enables rotary 

motion to be imparted to the rod (11) in order to pass from one 
position to the other, which device is prevented from being removed 

so long as the cam (13) is not correctly positioned in one or other 
of the grooves (14a, 14b). 
A structure according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the 
cam (13) is properly positioned in one or other of the grooves (14a, 

14b) by means of a system comprising a ball (18) that co-operates 
with a cavity (19), one of the ball and cavity being disposed in the 

bottom of the groove and the other at the radial end of the cam. 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that the sliding supports (9) are fitted with ball-bearing sockets 

(20). 
A structure according to any one of claims 8 to 11, characterized 
in that a resilient member urges the rod (11) into a cam position 

that causes the cam (13) to be engaged in one or other of the grooves 
(14a, 14b). 
A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that the rigid connections between the sliding supports (9) and 

the longitudinal underframe elements (5) are constituted by links 
that absorb energy in the event of major acceleration due to an 

accidental collision of the public passenger vehicle.
