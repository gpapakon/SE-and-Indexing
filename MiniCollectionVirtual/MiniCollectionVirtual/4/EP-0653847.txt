<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit includes a digital signal processor (DSP) (e.g., 
101) and an error correction co-processor (ECCP) (e.g., 113) that implements a 

Viterbi decoding function. The DSP and ECCP share a block of multi-port memory 
(e.g., 116), typically by bus multiplexing a dual-port RAM. When the ECCP 

possesses the RAM, it inhibits the DSP from accessing that block of the RAM by 
asserting an EBUSY flag. This technique conserves and optimizes the RAM usage, 

allowing the DSP and ECCP to advantageously be formed on the same integrated 
circuit chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated circuit having a digital 
processor, a Viterbi decoder, and a shared memory. Viterbi decoders are used in signal processing applications to give an 
improved estimate of a received digital signal sequence in the face of channel noise. 
For example, cellular telephones are increasingly moving to digital transmission 
techniques of various types. One digital standard (GSM) has been generally adopted 
for use in Europe, while another (IS54) is intended for use in North America, with 
still others under consideration. However, the nature of cellular transmission and 
reception, often occurring from moving vehicles or pedestrians, gives rise to a 
variety of channel disturbances. For example, multi-path interference exists when 
reflections from nearby objects causes several signals, delayed in time from the 
original signal, to be received. Therefore, the received digital sequence may not 
exactly match the transmitted sequence. The digital sequences are sent in "packets" 
having a desired number of digital bits, which may be fixed, or alternatively variable, 
in order to compensate for transmission difficulties. The above-noted standards 
provide various forms of Forward Error Correction (FEC), by which additional bits 
are included in the packets to provide a degree of redundancy in transmission, so that 
errors may be detected and corrected to some degree at the receiving end. The 
packets may contain digitized voice information or other forms of data, including 
computer files, video information, etc. A Viterbi trellis decoder is one commonly used method of decoding the 
received packets in order to recover the transmitted sequence. That is, given the 
properties of the FEC encoder used, some sequences of bits are more likely than 
others. Therefore, the Viterbi decoder provides a MLSE (Most Likely Sequence 
Estimation) deconvolution output, to more accurately recover the transmitted 
sequence in the face of channel noise and distortion of various types. In addition to 
correcting errors due to random noise, a Viterbi decoder can improve receiver 
performance in the presence of multi-path interference, since the received digits are 
then not independent of one another, but correlated to some degree. The decoding of  
 
a known bit sequence can then be used to adjust the tap weights of an equalizer, 
which compensates for the multi-path interference. Therefore, a knowledge of the 
history of a received signal sequence can be used to improve the accuracy of
