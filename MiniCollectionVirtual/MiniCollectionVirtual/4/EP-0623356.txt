<ABSTRACT>
The dual lumen needle (1), according to the present invention, for withdrawal of body fluids, for example blood or tissue fluid, essentially comprises first and second cannulas (3, 12) arranged in parallel. The first cannula (3) has an insertion needle (2) which can be removed after insertion of the withdrawal needle (1) and whose ground end (4) projects beyond the first cannula (3). Furthermore, the handle (8) of the withdrawal needle (1) comprises connections (10, 11) for the two cannulas (3, 12) as well as a separate opening sealed by an elastic stopper (18) for withdrawal of the insertion needle (2). The second cannula (12) is integrally formed with the first cannula (3), and the wall of the first cannula (3) has wall openings (5) in that region which is not occupied by the second cannula (12).

<CLAIMS>
Two-channel sampling needle (1) for withdrawing body fluids, 
such as blood or tissue fluid, comprising two substantially 

parallel flexible cannulas (3, 12), the first cannula (3) being 
provided with an insertion needle (2) which may be removed after 

the sampling needle (1) has been introduced, the sharpened, 
pointed or knife-shaped end (4) of said insertion needle (2) 

projecting beyond the end of the first cannula (3), and a 
mounting part (8) of the sampling needle (1) being provided with 

fittings (10, 11) for the two cannulas (3, 12) and a separate 
opening for removing the insertion needle (2), which opening is 

plugged by an elastic stopper (18), both cannulas being made of 
synthetic material, 
characterized in that
 the second cannula (12) 
is configured in one piece with the first cannula (3), the wall 

of the first cannula (3) having perforations (5) in the area not 
used by the second cannula (12). 
Sampling needle according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the lumen of the second cannula (12) extends into that of the 

first cannula (3) only after the insertion needle (2) has been 
removed. 
Sampling needle according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 both fittings (10, 11) of the sampling needle (1) can be 
inserted into a coupling element (21) with ingoing and outgoing 

lines, without any risk of confusion.
