<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrically operated preheater for driers for producing green, carbonaceous compounds. A known preheater has the disadvantage of the inhomogeneous flow of the compound and the inhomogeneous preheating of the drier. This disadvantage is avoided with the embodiment according to the invention.

Apparatus for electrically preheating a dry substance for the
production of green materials for electrodes, wherein the apparatus has a

round silo housing (22) with a core (34), electrodes (41. 43) which extend
at the top and bottom ends between the silo housing (22) and the core (34)

and which are connected to a current source (15), and at the upper end a
concentric first filling pipe (19). characterised in that provided at the

lower end is a concentric second filling pipe (20) into which a rotating
discharge tool (47) conveys, wherein the first filling pipe (19) and the

second filling pipe (20) are arranged in covers (31 and 33).
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the silo
housing (22) comprises rings (23) or ceramic. electrically non-conducting

material, which are arranged in concentric superposed relationship.
Apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in that the rings are
held in their concentric position by steps (25).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that
the silo housing (22) is surrounded by a tubular casing (28) in spaced

relationship by way of support means (29).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the upper-end (41) inner electrodes detemine the concentric position of the

core (34) with respect to the silo housing (22) and a metal ring (42)
determines the axial position of the core in the silo housing (22).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the upper-end (41) and lower-end (43) inner electrodes are connected by way

of an upper electrode (17) to a current source, preferably a rectifier (15). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that
the discharge device (47) comprises a star of a plurality of arms (48)

curved in a circular configuration.
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that there are
provided two preheaters which are rotatable about a perpendicular axis.
