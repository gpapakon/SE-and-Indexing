<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE FOR EVALUATING SHORT STATURE ETIOLOGYFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention provides a method for diagnosing the etiology of short stature in children.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONStimulated growth hormone GH secretion using a variety of provocative agents including 1-dopa, clonidine, arginine and insulin have been assessed in slowly or poorly growing children in an attempt to determine the etiology of short stature. However, the reliability of those tests has been the subject of significant debate because differential GH secretion in subsets of short-statured children makes the data difficult to interpret. For example, provocative agents whose action is mediated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) cannot differentiate hypothalamic defects from pituitary defects in the GH neuroendocrine axis. Thus, the isolation, characterization and synthesis of growth hormone- releasing hormone (GHRH) provided a potentially valuable diagnostic tool for evaluation of growth hormone (GH) deficiency and differentiation between hypothalamic and pituitary decrements (O. Butinandt, Acta Paediatr. Scand [suppl.] 1989; 349. 93-9). However, its diagnostic value has been surprisingly limited because of marked variability in GH secretion following administration of GHRH (A. Pertzelan et al., 

Hormone Res 1985; .22., 24-31) . In an attempt to explain this variability, it was proposed that some children with GH deficiency due to hypothalamic etiology were hyporesponsive to a single dose of GHRH because of chronic deprivation of the exposure to the peptide (E.A. Schriock et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984, 58.: 1043-1049). This explanation was not completely adequate because subnormal GH responses to a single GHRH injection were also observed in GH sufficient children (P. Chatelain et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987: 65: 387-394) .Another proposal to explain variable responses to provocative GHRH tests was that GH releasing activity of the peptide varied with the time of its administration (P.M. Martha et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67, 449-454). Endogenous hypothalamic-somatotroph secretory rhythm affect the GH response to GHRH in humans (J. Deversa et al., Clinical Endocrinology 1989; 30. 367-377) , and rats in vivo (G.H. Albini et al.. Clinical Pharmacol Ther. 1988, .43., 696-700) and in vitro (G.S. Tannenbaum et al., Endocrinology 1989; 124. 1380-1388) and this rhythm might cause the variation in GH responsivity following exogenous GHRH. Thus, debate has considered whether

 CLAIMS
1. A method for measuring the effect of a growth hormone releasing compound and GHRP-6 or a peptide which causes release of growth hormone by the same cellular mechanism as
GHRP-6 on the blood levels of growth hormone in a child of short stature which comprises the steps of:
(a) establishing a baseline level of growth hormone in the blood of said child;
(b) administering an amount of growth hormone releasing compound known to be effective to cause an increase in growth hormone levels in the blood; (c) administering an amount of GHRP-6, or a peptide which causes release of growth hormone by the same cellular mechanism as GHRP-6, known to be effective to cause an increase in growth hormone levels in the blood; (d) administering a combination of GHRH and GHRP-6 or a peptide which causes release of growth hormone by the same cellular mechanism as GHRP-6 in amounts known to be effective to cause an increase in growth hormone levels in the blood; and
