<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the production of a 
hydroxylic compound selected from alcohols and diols by 

hydrogenation of a hydrogenatable material selected from 
monoesters of carboxylic acids, monoesters of dicarboxylic 

acids, diesters of dicarboxylic acids, aldehydes, 
olefinically unsaturated aldehydes, and mixtures of two or 

more thereof, which process comprises the steps of: 

(a) providing a hydrogenation zone containing a charge 
of a granular hydrogenation catalyst which has a total 

surface area of at least about 15 m²/g, a pore size 
distribution such that more than 50% of the pore volume is 

provided by pores in the size range less than about 40 nm, 
and a surface area distribution such that more than 50% of 

the total surface area is provided by pores in the size 
range of from about 7 nm to about 40 nm; 
(b) supplying to the hydrogenation zone a feed stream 
of a mixture containing hydrogen and the hydrogenatable 

material; 
(c) maintaining the hydrogenation zone under 
temperature and pressure conditions which are conducive to 

effecting hydrogenation of the hydrogenatable material; and 
(d) recovering from the hydrogenation zone a product 
stream comprising the hydroxylic compound. 
The process is exemplified by the hydrogenation of 
dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate to yield 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of a hydroxylic compound selected from alcohols 
and diols by hydrogenation of a corresponding hydrogenatable 
material selected from monoesters of carboxylic acids, 
monoesters of dicarboxylic acids, diesters of dicarboxylic 
acids, aldehydes, olefinically unsaturated aldehydes, and 
mixtures of two or more thereof. It is known to produce alcohols by hydrogenation, 
or more properly hydrogenolysis, of monoesters of carboxylic 
acids. The reaction can be summarised as follows:- 
 
In the book "Catalytic Hydrogenation" by M. Freifelder, 
published by John Wiley and Sons Inc. (1978), it is stated 
at page 129 et seq. that the catalyst of choice is barium 
promoted copper chromite. In "Organic Reactions", Vol. 8, 
published by John Wiley and Sons Inc. (1954), Chapter I is 
by Homer Adkins and is entitled "Catalytic Hydrogenation of 
Esters to Alcohols". It is suggested that a "copper 
chromite" catalyst is more correctly described as an 
approximately equimolar combination of cupric oxide and 
cupric chromite, i.e. CuO,CuCr2O4. Reference may also be 
had to Kirk-Othmer's "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology" 
(Third Edition), Volume 1, page 733 to 739. Patent specifications describing hydrogenation of 
esters to yield alcohols include US-A-2040944, US-A-2079414, 
US-A-2091800, and FR-A-1276722. It is known to effect hydrogenation of certain 
esters and diesters in the vapour phase. For example it has 
been proposed to use a reduced copper oxide/zinc oxide 
catalyst for effecting hydrogenation of esters in the vapour  
 
phase. In this connection attention is directed to GB-B-2116552. 
Also of relevance is WO-A-90/8121. It is further known to produce diols, such as 
butane-1,4-diol, by catalytic hydrogenation of esters of 
dicarboxylic acids, such as a dimethyl or diethyl ester of 
maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, or a mixture of 
two or more thereof. Such processes are described, for 
example, in GB-A-1454440, GB-A-1464263, DE-A-2719867, US-A-4032458, 
and US-A-4172961. Production of butane-1,4-diol by vapour phase 
hydrogenation of a diester, typically a dialkyl ester, of a 
C4 dicarboxylic acid selected from maleic acid, fumaric 
acid, succinic acid, and a mixture of two or more thereof 
has been proposed. In such a process the diester is 
conveniently a di-(C1-4-alkyl) ester, such as dimethyl or 
diethyl maleate, fumarate, or succinate. A further 
description of such a process can be found in US-A-4584419, 
EP-A-0143634, WO-A-86/03189,
