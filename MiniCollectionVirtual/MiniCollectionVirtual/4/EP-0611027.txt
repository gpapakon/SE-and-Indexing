<ABSTRACT>
A padlock including a lock body (1) and a substantially 
U-shaped shackle (2), a lock mechanism (4) fitted into a 

cavity (3) in the lock body and to which at least one lock 
bolt (5) is functionally connected for locking the shackle to 

the lock body (1), a cover element (6), which is turnably 
connected to the lock body (1), preferably by means of 

threads, and which is located in a key-insertion direction in 
front of the lock mechanism (4), and blocking means for 

fastening the cover element (6) to the lock body (1). The 
blocking means comprise a stop member (7) which is arranged 

in the lock body transversally with regard to the cover 
element (6), is removable in the open position of the shackle 

(2) and prevents, in its blocking position, turning of the 
cover element (6) relative to the lock body (1), and a locking 

ring (10) positionable in a groove (9) in the lock body (1) 
surrounding the cover element and arranged to be installed 

in its position if the cover element (6) is to be locked 
permanently to the lock body (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a padlock of the kind including 
a lock body and a shackle, typically a substantially U-shaped 
shackle, a key-operated lock mechanism, preferably a cylinder 
lock with turnable locking discs, fitted into a cavity in the 
lock body to which at least one locking means is functionally 
connected for locking the shackle to the lock body, a cover 
element which is turnably connected, preferably by means of 
threads, to the lock body and which is arranged in front of 
the lock mechanism in a key insertion direction, and blocking 
means for fastening the cover element to the lock body. Different versions of padlocks are produced for different 
purposes, inter alia depending on whether the padlock is to 
be provided with a facility for changing the lock mechanism 
or at least its opening combination. For this purpose it is 
known to provide padlocks with a cover element which is 
positioned in front of the lock mechanism and is removably 
fastened to the lock body. For instance US-A-4545223 shows a turnable cover element which is retained in its position in the lock body by means of a separate blocking means. The cover element can then be 
removed after first opening the lock mechanism, moving the 
shackle into its releasing or open position and then removing the 
blocking means from its blocking position. If there is no need to provide the padlock with the 
facility referred to above, of changing the lock mechanism or 
its opening combination, a locking ring, for example 
as shown in DE-A-3421754, can be used as a fastening arrangement. From the view 
point of production and in order to reduce stock items, on the 
other hand, it would be of advantage to keep different 
versions of padlocks to a minimum. The above cited documents represent the prior art as referred to in the preamble of the appended claim 1. An aim of the invention is to provide a padlock of the 
kind referred to that is favourable from the view point of 
production and that can still be easily modified for different 
purposes according to need so that the mentioned possibility 
of changing the lock mechanism or the opening combination 
thereof is especially taken account of.  
 The aim of the invention is achieved by providing a 
padlock of the kind referred to according to the 
characterising part of the ensuing claim 1. By designing a padlock in accordance with the invention 
it is sufficient to have only one padlock construction, 
whereby the facility for changing the lock mechanism or its 
opening combination, is

<CLAIMS>
A padlock including a lock body (1) and a shackle (2) 
movable between open and closed positions, a key-operated lock 

mechanism (4) fitted into a cavity (3) in the lock body to 
which lock mechanism at least one locking means (5) is functionally connected 

for locking the shackle to the lock body (1), a cover element 
(6) which is turnably connected to the lock body (1) and which 

is arranged in front of the lock mechanism (4) in a key 
insertion direction, and blocking means for fastening the 

cover element (6) to the lock body (1), characterised in that 
the said blocking means comprise a stop member (7) which is 

arranged in the lock body transversally with regard to said 
key insertion direction, is removable in the open position of 

the shackle (2) and prevents turning of the cover element (6) 
relative to the lock body (1) when in a blocking position, 

a groove (9) in the lock body (1) surrounding the cover 
element, and a locking ring (10), said locking ring (10) being adapted to be retained 

in the groove (9) for engagement with the cover element (6) to lock the latter 
permanently to the lock body (1). 
A padlock according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the locking ring (10) is positioned in said groove (9) in the 

lock body (1) and engages with the cover element (6) to lock 
the latter permanently to the lock body (1). 
A padlock according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the cover element (6) includes a groove (11) for partly 

receiving the locking ring (10), and that the groove (11) is 
located in front, in the 

key insertion direction, of at least one recess (12) arranged to partly receive the stop member (7) at the blocking position thereof. 
A padlock according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the cover element (6) includes a 

plurality of recesses (12) angularly spaced apart around the 
cover element (6), any one of which is able to partly receive 

the stop member (7), at the blocking position thereof, depending 
on the angular position of the cover element (6).  

 
A padlock according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the key-operated lock mechanism 

comprises a cylinder lock with turnable locking discs. 
A padlock according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cover element (6) is screwthreadedly 

connected to the lock body (1).
