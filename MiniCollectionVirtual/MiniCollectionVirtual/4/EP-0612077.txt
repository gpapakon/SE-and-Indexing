<ABSTRACT>
The confinement and cover enclosure (10) includes a thermally insulated wall (13, 14) intended to thermally insulate the external surface (2a) of the vessel head (2). The thermally insulated wall (13, 14) is leaktight with respect to the fluid coming from the reactor vessel in the event of a leak and includes leaktight means (15, 27), for connection to the external surface (2a) of the head and to the adaptors (nozzles) (6), making it posible to define a chamber (30) for confinement and recovery of the leakage gas.

Containing and covering shell (10) for the 
upper convex surface (2a) of the cover (2) of the 

vessel of a pressurized-water nuclear reactor of 
bulbous form, through which tubular adaptors (6) 

pass, which adaptors have a part projecting above 
the upper surface (2a) of the cover (2) of the 

vessel (1) at the end of which there is secured a 
displacement mechanism (7) of a control rod, the 

shell (10) comprising a lateral wall (13) of 
tubular shape bearing on the upper surface (2a) of 

the cover (2) of the vessel and surrounding all 
the adapters (6) passing through the cover (2) and 

an upper closing wall (14) secured on the upper 
part of the lateral wall (13) below the control 

mechanisms (7) and through which the adaptors (6) 
pass, characterised in that the lateral wall (13) 

and the upper wall (14) are produced in the form 
of heat insulated walls connected to one another 

and resting on the cover (2) of the vessel by 
means of leaktight joints (15,25), the joints (27) 

also ensuring the leaktightness of the of the 
passages through which the adaptors (6) pass in  

 
the upper wall (14) in such a manner as to delimit 

a fluid recovery chamber (30) between the shell 
(10) and the outer surface of the cover (2) of the 

vessel, the shell (10) comprising means (31) for 
sampling gas inside the fluid-recovery chamber 

(30). 
Shell according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the upper wall (14,16) is formed of flat 

panels (35,36,50) connected to one another along 
their edges with interposition of leaktight joints 

(37,37',57), at least one of the edges of the 
panels delimiting apertures (55) through which the 

adaptors (6) pass. 
Shell according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that each of the panels (35, 35a, 35b) 

comprises a first flat side connection surface 
(38,38a,38b) and a second side connection surface 

in the form of a step (39,39a,39b), the apertures 
through which the adapters (6) pass being provided 

in the flat connection surfaces (38, 38a, 38b) of 

the panels (35, 35a, 35b). 
Shell according to Claim 2, characterised 
by that fact that each of the panels (50) 

comprises two flat opposite side connection 
surfaces (51a,51b) in which there are provided  

 
apertures (55) through which the adaptors (6) 

pass. 
Shell according to any one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the means (31) for 

sampling the fluid is formed of a network for 
sampling the fluid at a plurality of points on the 

lower surface of the flat upper wall (14, 16). 
Shell according to any one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that it comprises at least two 

girders (45) for maintaining the panels (35, 35a, 
35b) secured to the adapters (6) or on a fixed 

skirt (8) surrounding the adapters. 
Shell according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the leaktight joints (15, 

25, 33, 37, 37') are produced of one of the 
following materials: 


braided glass fibres; 
braided ceramic fibres; 
glass fabric envelope packed with glass 
fibres in bulk; 
ceramic fibre envelope packed with 
ceramic fibres in bulk; 
metallic braid of austenitic stainless steel ;  
 
braid of glass in which is included a spring of 
austenitic stainless steel fibres ; and 
silicone joint. 
Vessel according to any one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that the heat-insulating walls 

(13,14,41,46) comprise external layers of 
stainless steel sheet between which there is 

intercalated an alveolar stack of stainless steel 
leaves.
