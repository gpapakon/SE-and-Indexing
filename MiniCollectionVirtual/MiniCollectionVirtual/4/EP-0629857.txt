<ABSTRACT>
An immunoassay for quantitatively determining an 
antigen in a sample is disclosed, which comprises 

immobilizing a primary antibody in a purified state or in a 
diluted serum to the surface of a carrier via an affinity 

ligand, particularly protein A, immobilizing an antigen to be 
determined to the primary antibody, and reacting a labelled 

secondary antibody with the antigen. This method can attain 
a markedly improved identification limit and measurement 

limit which have not been attained by conventional methods, 
eliminates purification of the primary antibody, and enables 

one to save the amount of immobilized antibody. In addition, 
it provides a measuring method which is inexpensive and yet 

effective and which can determine a trace amount of 
ingredient with high sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an immunoassay for 
quantitatively determining antigens in a sample. Immunoassay useful for determinig trace amounts of 
substances have been extensively employed in various fields 
including basic investigations and clinical diagnosis. In the non-competitive immunoassay system well 
known as the sandwitch method, antigens to be determined are 
captured on a solid phase via a primary antibody immobilized 
on the solid phase, then the antigens are reacted with a 
secondary antibody labeled with a proper marker such as an 
enzyme or radioactive iodine, followed by measuring the 
activity of the bound marker. Thus, the antigens are 
quantitatively determined based on the measured activity. The most popularly employed method for 
immobilizing a primary antibody is a method which comprises 
applying an antibody-containing solution to a microtiter 
plate made of a synthetic resin such as polystyrene to 
thereby immobilize the antibody onto the plate through 
physical adsorption or formation of chemical bonds. In 
immobilizing antibodies by such method, the antibody 
molecules are considered to be adsorbed or bound disorderly 
onto the surface of the carrier through intermolecular  
 
attraction with the carrier or through formation of covalent 
bonds. Hence, the variable region of the antibody which 
should be used for specifically binding an antigen may be 
bound to the carrier, that is, all of the antigen-binding 
region of the immobilized antibody molecules may not 
effectively bind the antigen, which means decrease of the 
antigen-binding ability, or titer, of the immobilized 
antibody. This results in a lower sensitivity than is 
desired. In determining trace amounts of substances 
according to the sandwitch method, the primary antibody must 
usually be purified before use, because antiserum contains 
large amounts of other proteins such as albumin than 
immunoglobulin, which compete against immobilization of 
immunoglobulin. If immobilization of a primary antibody can 
be conducted using antiserum, complicated purification of 
immunoglobulin can be eliminated. Elimination of the 
purification serves to save an expensive antiserum. In 
addition, antiserum generally has greater stability than 
that of purified immunoglobulin. As described above, conventional immobilizing 
methods are not fully satisfactory, and there it has been 
desired to develop a system in which a primary antibody is 
immobilized onto a carrier in high yield, and most of the 
antigen-binding region of the
