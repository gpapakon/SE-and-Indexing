<ABSTRACT>
A composition and method for passivating a 
galvanized metal surface is disclosed. The treatment 

solution comprises phosphoric acid, boric acid and 
optionally molybdic acid and is preferably essentially 

chromium free. The passivation treatment which may be 
rinsed or dried-in-place includes phosphoric acid, 

boric acid optionally molybdic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition and method 
for passivating a galvanized coating on a metal substrate. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a treatment of a 
galvanized or Galvalume (trademark of Bethlehem Steel Corporation) 
metal surface to inhibit corrosion without painting. The purposes of a formation of a chromate conversion 
coating on the surface of galvanized metal are to provide 
corrosion resistance, improve adhesion of coatings and for 
aesthetic reasons. Chromate passivation of a galvanized steel 
surface is done to provide corrosion resistance and for aesthetic 
reasons on materials which are not to be painted. A bulky, white 
corrosion product may form on an unprotected bright zinc surface 
when it becomes wet. This corrosion product is a mixture of zinc  
 
carbonate and zinc oxide or hydroxides resulting from zinc 
oxidation. The conditions producing the "humid storage" stain (so 
called white rust) most frequently occur in shipment and during 
storage, especially when daily temperature variations cause 
atmospheric water vapor to condense on a zinc surface. Likewise, 
black stains form on unprotected Galvalume. Galvalume is a 
trademark of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation for a zinc-aluminum 
galvanized coating over steel. Chrome based passivation treatments are applied to 
galvanized metals and Galvalume to provide both long term and 
short term corrosion protection. A chromate treatment is 
typically provided by contacting galvanized metal with an aqueous 
composition containing hexavalent and trivalent chromium ions, 
phosphate ions and fluoride ions. Growing concerns exist 
regarding the pollution effects of the chromate and phosphates 
discharged into rivers and waterways by such processes. Because 
of the high solubility and the strongly oxidizing character of 
hexavalent chromium ions, conventional chromate processes require 
extensive waste treatment procedures to control their discharge. 
In addition, the disposal of the solid sludge from such waste 
treatment procedures is a significant problem. Attempts have been made to produce an acceptable chromate 
free conversion coating for passivation of galvanized metal. 
Chromate free pretreatments based upon complex fluoacids and salts 
or metals such as cobalt and nickel are known in the art.  
 
U.S. Patent No. 3,468,724 which issued to Reinhold discloses a 
composition for coating ferriferous and zinc metal which 
comprises a metal such as nickel or cobalt and an acid anion 
selected from the group
