<ABSTRACT>
A rubber or plastic sleeve (6) is described which, once mounted on a 
flexible hose (1) for hydraulic brakes in coincidence with the hose 

connections, improves its resistance to mechanical, thermic and 
environmental stress, thus allowing the flexible hose (1) to get through 

the fatigue test foreseen by the type-testing rules in force for said 
kind of hoses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention consists of a sleeve (made of plastics or rubber) 
which, once mounted on a flexible hose for hydraulic brakes in 
coincidence with the hose connections, improves its resistance to 
mechanical, thermic and environmental stress thus allowing the flexible 
hose to get through the fatigue test foreseen by the type-testing rules 
in force for this kind of hoses. Flexible hoses for high- and low-pressure fluids are known in the Art and 
widely used as particularly demanding devices such as, for instance, 
braking systems for racing vehicles (particularly motorbykes and racing 
cars) or off-roads, chemical and pharmaceutical devices working by means 
of high-pressure fluids, and so on. Among the known types of flexible hoses, the most advantageous are those 
consisting of a hose made of plastic or rubber provided with an outer 
sheath made of woven metal wire or of textiles, said sheath conferring to 
the flexible hose a high resistance to pressure and the faculty of being 
bent without danger of flattening. A further type of hose connections are also known in the Art which, once 
mounted on both ends of a flexible hose, allow the connection of said 
hose to two elements (e.g. a pump for the braking system and, 
respectively, one of the braking systems) connected by means of said 
flexible hose, with no pressure or fluid loss. Among the known types of hoses the most efficient is the one described in 
EP 0 258 524 consisting of a metal coupling comprising a shank with 
suitably shaped seats on which one end of the flexible hose (preferably  
 
the kind coated with metal sheath) is inserted by pressure and of an 
outer metal sleeve which, once tightened against the flexible hose by 
means of punches or by another equivalent means, blocks said hose in the 
seats made in the shank of the metal coupling. Flexible hoses equipped with the aforesaid hose connection have been 
successfully used for a long time in braking systems for racing vehicles 
but they are not used for hydraulic brakes in normal vehicles since they 
are not type-tested for this use. The rules presently in force for type-testing of hydraulic brakes such 
as, for instance, the American rule SAE J 1401 cited as a reference in 
the present description, foresee getting through several tests among 
which there is a fatigue test. Said fatigue test briefly consists in 
fastening the hose connection linked to one end of the flexible hose to 
a fixed point and in fastening the hose connection linked to the other 
end of the flexible
