<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing system.Conventionally the performance of a copier has
been limited to faithful reproduction of an original
or magnification or reduction of the original image
with a fixed ratio.Such copier basically functions by illuminating
the original with a light source such as a fluorescent
lamp or a tungsten lamp, projecting the reflected
light from said original through lenses and mirrors
onto a photosensitive member charged in advance thereby
forming an electrostatic latent image thereon, and
applying developer onto said photosensitive member to
obtain a visible image. Consequently the image
forming process is conducted all under mechanical
control, and the magnification or reduction of the
original image is achieved through a relative change
between the lens movement and the original scanning
speed. The range of multiple functions in such
conventional copier is inevitably limited, since such
lens movement or speed change has a certain physical 
limit. It has also been difficult to arbitrarily move
the image position on the copy sheet, and such movement
has been considerably limited.Also there is proposed a copier in which the
original image is once stored in a memory and then
read as image data for making a print, but such
apparatus is quite unsatisfactory as a copier since an
extremely long time is required from the start of image
scanning to the completion of printing operation.Besides the conventional copier is often unable
to produce a satisfactory image quality from an
original with a dark background, and is unable to
faithfully reproduce certain originals such as photographs.Furthermore, in copying with a modified size
different from the original size, the selection of
direction of original or of image magnification
becomes quite cumbersome with the increase in the sizes
of copy sheets and of originals.Furthermore, in book copying, it is often
difficult to place the book to be copied on an exact
position on the platen, and is therefore difficult to
obtain the copied image on a desired position of the
copy sheet. Also in such book copying mode, the image
quality is inevitably deteriorated since shadows are
formed around the book and reproduced on the copy.
Also in case of copying both pages at left and at 
right of an open book, the book has to be moved at
each copying operation.EP-A-0 105 517, filed by the same applicant as the present application, and part
of the prior art under Article 54 (3) EPC only, discloses an image processing
apparatus which
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image processing apparatus comprising:

means 
(A)
 for scanning an original document placed on an
original supporting glass 
(3)
;
printer means 
(606)
 for detecting coordinates 
(X1-X4, Y1-Y4)
 defining an area surrounding
the original document on the original supporting glass 
(3)
,
on the basis of an image signal produced by said scanning

means 
(A)
;
means 
(B)
 for reproducing an image of the original
document scanned by said scanning means 
(A)
 on a material;
means 
(614)
 for determining a length and a width of said
original document on the basis of said detected coordinates,

and for determining a first magnification ratio on the basis
of said determined length of the original document and a

length of the material and a second magnification ratio on
the basis of said determined width of the original document

and a width of the material;
means 
(614)
 for selecting a smaller one of the first
magnification ratio and the second magnification ratio

determined by said determining means; and
means 
(1)
 for controlling said reproducing means 
(B)
 in
accordance with the selected magnification ratio so as to

reproduce the image of the original document within the

boundaries of the surface of the material.
An image processing apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein said detecting means 
(606)
 detects the coordinates of
the original document on the basis of the image signal

produced by said scanning means 
(A)
 during a pre-scanning
operation. 
An image processing apparatus according to claim 1
or 2, wherein said detecting means 
(606)
 comprises means
for discriminating that a certain image signal is

continuously produced for a predetermined period by said
scanning means 
(A)
, and said detecting means 
(A)
 detects the
coordinates if

said discrimination means indicates that said certain
image signal is continuously produced for a predetermined period.
An image processing apparatus according to claim 3,
wherein the certain image signal represents a predetermined number of bits of white image data.
An image processing apparatus according to claim 3
or 4, wherein said image processing apparatus further

comprises means

original document by detecting the minimum and maximum

coordinates in the main- and sub-scanning directions so that, even if the
original document is set obliquely on the original supporting

glass 
(3)
 said area surrounding the original can
nonetheless be detected.
