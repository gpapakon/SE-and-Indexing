<ABSTRACT>
An aircraft servicing system comprises four robot arms 
mounted to the ground so as to form a lane with the base of two 

of the robot arms delineating one side of the lane and the base 
of the other two robots delineating the other side of the lane. 

The robot arms may assume a low position which allows an 
aircraft's wings to pass over the arms while the aircraft enters 

the lane between the arms. Thereafter, the arms may be moved so 
that a nozzle array at the end of each arm may de-ice or wash the 

aircraft. Subsequently, the arms may again assume a low position 
to allow the aircraft to leave the lane. Each robot arm has an 

elongated member (24) connected to the base by a yaw joint (23), a first 
arm segment (28) connected to the elongated member by a pitch joint (30), 

second arm segment (28) connected to the first arm segment by a pitch 
joint (36), and a third arm segment (38) connected to the second arm 

segment by a telescoping joint (40). This gives the arm the needed 
range of motion and provides one degree of redundancy so that the 

arm has some freedom of movement while the end effector is 
stationary in free-space. This allows the arm to be reconfigured 

as necessary, on a dynamic basis, so as to anticipate 
possible singularities and avoid these. The system has 

application for servicing other large structures, such as the 
hull of a dry docked ship.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a robot arm and, in one 
aspect, a robot arm system, and method for its use, for servicing 
aircraft. The great majority of aircraft de-icing is accomplished 
with mobile boom trucks. An operator sits in a cab on a boom and 
has controls in order to position the boom appropriately so that 
the operator may spray an aircraft by way of nozzles which extend 
from the cab. Aircraft safety would be enhanced if aircraft hold over 
time available subsequent to de-icing were increased. 
Furthermore, the glycol used in de-icing causes environmental 
concerns and the ability to recycle this glycol would be 
advantageous. The present invention seeks to overcome drawbacks of 
known de-icing systems. More generally, the present invention 
seeks to provide a robot system for servicing large structures. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a robot arm comprising the following: a base; a member mounted 
to said base by a yaw joint such that said member has an axis of  
 
rotation; a first arm segment joined to said member by a first 
pitch joint, said first pitch joint having an angular range 
sufficient to allow said first arm segment to make about a right 
angle with said axis of rotation of said member; a second arm 
segment joined to said first arm segment by a second pitch joint; 
a third arm segment joined to said second arm segment by a 
telescopic joint; an end effector joined to said third arm 
segment. According to another aspect to this invention, there 
is provided a method of servicing an aircraft with an aircraft 
servicing system comprising four robot arms, each of said robot 
arms of the type having a base mounted to the ground; a member 
mounted to said base by a yaw joint such that said member has an 
upstanding axis of rotation; a first arm segment joined to said 
member by a first pitch joint, said first pitch joint having an 
angular range sufficient to allow said first arm segment to make 
about a right angle with said axis of rotation of said member; 
a second arm segment joined to said first arm segment by a second 
pitch joint, said second pitch joint having an angular range 
which permits end-to-end alignment of said second arm segment 
with said first arm segment; a third arm segment joined to said 
second arm segment by a telescopic joint; an end effector joined 
to said third arm segment; said first pitch joint, said second 
pitch joint, and said telescopic joint providing one degree of 
redundancy such that, at least for some orientations of said
