<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cephem compounds having 
antimicrobial activity, inter alia, antibacterial activity, 
and to antimicrobial agents which contain at least one of the 
compounds as an active ingredient. Various cephem compounds or derivatives thereof have been 
hitherto synthesized which have a quaternary ammonium methyl 
group at the 3-position and, at the same time, a 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido 
group was located at 
the 7-position. Among them, there are some compounds which have 
a pyridinium group as the quaternary ammonium group and 
substituent groups on the pyridinium ring. These substituent 
groups are, however, extremely limited and these compounds are 
not always satisfactory in terms of the strength of 
antimicrobial or antibacterial activity and the broadness of 
antimicrobial or antibacterial spectrum. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a microbial or antibacterial agent, especially one which 
is effective against MRSA. The term MRSA used in the present  
 
specification is an abbreviation of methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus. The present invention thus provides novel antimicrobial or 
antibacterial agents and novel cephem compounds usable as an 
active principle of such antimicrobial or antibacterial agents, 
which satisfy the above object and other objects of the present 
invention which will become apparent from the description of the 
invention given hereinbelow. In an aspect of the present invention there are provided 
some novel cephem compounds. In another aspect of the present 
invention, there are provided some novel antimicrobial or 
antibacterial agents containing, as an active ingredient, at 
least one of such cephem compounds. The inventors of the present invention have examined 
various substituent groups to be located on the aforementioned 
pyridinium ring and found that compounds having a certain 
substituent group on the pyridinium ring can show an excellent 
antimicrobial activity, and a more excellent antibacterial 
activity especially on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus . Accordingly, the present invention relates to cephem 
compounds represented by the followinq general formula (I) or 
physiologically or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,  
 
and to antimicrobial or antibacterial agents which contain at 
least one of the compounds as an active ingredient. 
In the above formula, R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or an amino 
group protecting group; R² represents a hydrogen atom or a 
hydro
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cephem compound represented by the following general 
formula (I) : 

 
wherein R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or an amino group-protecting 

group; R² represents a hydrogen atom or a 
hydroxyimino group-protecting group; R³ is a 3- or 4-position 

substituent group on the pyridinium ring and represents a 
carbamoylmethyl group, 
a ureido group, a thiazol group which may 
be substituted with an amino group, a thiadiazol group which may 

be substituted with an amino group, an oxadiazol group which may 
be substituted with an amino group, or a group represented by 

the following general formula (1) 
 

(wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group); 
 

R⁴ represents a carboxyl or carboxylate group which may be 
protected; and Q represents CH or N; and a physiologically or 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 
An antimicrobial or antibacterial agent which contains 
as an active ingredient at least one of the cephem compounds 

represented by the general formula (I) described in claim 1 
and/or a physiologically or pharmaceutically acceptable salt 

thereof. 
A compound according to claim 1 for pharmaceutical 
use. 
Use of a compound according to claim 1 in the 
manufacture of an antimicrobial. 
Use according to claim 4 wherein the antimicrobial 
is an antibacterial.
