<ABSTRACT>
The downstream obstacles (4) of a turbojet thrust reverser include means for aerodynamic guidance of a layer of cold air cooling the obstacle (4) and isolating it from hot gases. These guide means include retractable deflectors (baffles) (12) located on the internal face of the obstacle (4).

<CLAIMS>
A thrust reverser for a bypass turbojet engine comprising at least two
obstacles (4) which, in forward thrust configuration, are incorporated into the

outer wall and into the prolongation of the engine exhaust duct and, in reverse
thrust configuration, are positioned in the path of the hot and cold flows so as

to divert the flows and reverse the thrust, said obstacles (4) comprising means
for aerodynamically guiding a cold air layer contacting said obstacle (4), said

guide means consisting of retractable deflectors (12) disposed on the inner
surface of said downstream obstacles (4) such that, in forward thrust

configuration, the deflectors (12) are retracted into a recess in the wall of the
obstacle so as not to disturb the aerodynamic flows, whereas, in thrust reversal

configuration, the deflectors (12)are moved out of the recess and act on the
flow along the inner wall of the obstacles (4), characterised in that the

dimensions and position of said emerged deflectors (12) are so determined as to
channel the cold flow and prevent the hot flow from striking said obstacles (4)

and in that an axis of rotation of the obstacles (4) carries a lever (16) which is
stationary relative to the engine structure and is connected to a first rod (15)

actuating a bell crank (14) whose other end actuates a second rod (13)
connected to said retractable deflector (12) so that the displacement of the

obstacle (4) causes the displacement of the associated deflectors (12).
