<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a colour image (print) in which a photosensitive material containing a temporary backing film, a coloured photosensitive layer and an adhesive layer which can be activated by warming is laminated at elevated temperature and under pressure on to an image-receiving material which carries a pigment layer containing a white pigment on a layer support, the photosensitive layer is exposed imagewise and developed to give the image, the temporary backing film is peeled off from the image-receiving material before or after the exposure, and these steps are optionally repeated with at least one further photosensitive material whose coloured layer has a different colour. The process gives colour images with low dot enlargement compared with a screen mask and is particularly suitable for colour proofing of copying masks for multicolour printing.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of a colour image in which 
a photosensitive material, which has a temporary 

support film, a coloured photosensitive layer and an 
adhesive layer activatable by heating, is laminated at 

elevated temperature and under pressure onto an image-receiving 
material, the photosensitive layer is 

exposed with the image and developed to yield the 
image, the temporary support film is peeled off the 

image-receiving material before or after exposure and 
these stages are optionally repeated with at least one 

further photosensitive material having a coloured 
layer of a different colour, characterised in that an 

image-receiving material is used which bears on a 
layer support a pigment layer containing a white 

pigment, wherein the pigment layer is transferred by 
lamination under pressure and with heating from a 

temporary support film of a layer material which 
consists of 


the temporary support film, 
the pigment layer, which contains at least 
10 wt.% of the white pigment, and 
an adhesion layer applied onto the pigment layer, 
which adhesion layer is not tacky at room 

temperature and has a softening point of below 
160°C. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the pigment layer of the image-receiving material 

contains a polymeric binder. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the photosensitive layer is exposed before the 

temporary support film is peeled off and the image is  
 

developed by peeling apart the temporary support film 
and image-receiving material. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the temporary support film is peeled off the 

photosensitive layer and the image is developed by 
washing the exposed photosensitive layer with a 

developer liquid. 
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the temporary support film is peeled off before 

exposure. 
Layer material for transferring a white pigment onto 
an image-receiving material for the production of 

coloured images, which material consists of 

a temporary support film, 
a pigment layer, which contains at least 10 wt.% 
of a white pigment and optionally a polymeric 

binder, and 
an adhesion layer which is not tacky at room 

temperature and has a softening point of below 
160°C. 
Layer material according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the white pigment is an inorganic pigment. 
Layer material according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the inorganic pigment is a water-insoluble oxide, 

sulphide, sulphate or carbonate of a metal of main 
group 2 or 4 or of sub-groups 2 and 4 of the periodic 

table. 
Layer material according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the polymeric binder is an alkyd resin, a  

 
phenolic resin, a vinyl polymer or a polyacrylate or 

polymethacrylate. 
Colour image producible in accordance with one or more 
of claims 1 to 5.
