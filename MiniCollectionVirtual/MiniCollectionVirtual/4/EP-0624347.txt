<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a 
cryoprobe for ablating a body surface, the cryoprobe 

comprising one or more non-linear elements adapted to receive 
refrigerant medium and arranged to conform to the body surface, 

such as the surface of a T-shaped body cavity, e.g. the uterus. 
One or more such elements may be kinked, curved or bent so that the 
probe is Y- or T-shaped in use. 
The elements may be flexible or articulated, and urged into the use 
configuration by a resiliant member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cryoprobe and is particularly, 
though not exclusively, concerned with an endometrial 
cryoprobe. The occurrence of both prolonged and heavy periods is a major 
problem for some women in their 30's, 40's and early 50's. 
Current methods of treatment for this condition have certain 
disadvantages as discussed below. The most radical approach to this problem, a hysterectomy, is 
disadvantageous in that it is a major operation which must be 
carried out under a general anaesthetic. The operation is also 
costly to perform. Currently available medications work poorly or have 
unacceptable side effects. Hysteroscopic transcervical resection of the endometrium 
(surgery on the endometrial wall performed through the cervix 
with the aid of an optical fibre probe) is an in-patient 
procedure requiring a general anaesthetic which is also costly. Radio frequency endometrial ablation (RFEA) has been used on 
an out-patient basis (e.g Phipps, J.H etal. Lancet 1990 
335:374-376). However, the equipment required is relatively 
costly - a typical unit costs about Â£60,000 - and the treatment 
does not satisfactorily ablate the fundal uterine wall.  Furthermore, dilation of the cervix to about 10 mm is required 
which is unsatisfactory. Endometrial cryosurgery employing a straight urological 
cryoprobe (Spembly DFS - 30 range) shown in elevation in the 
accompanying drawing Figure 1 and using liquid nitrogen as the 
refrigerant has been reported (Davies, W.A.R etal J. 
Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1985) 6, 117-119). However, the 
cryoprobe used may be disadvantageous in that it does not 
satisfactorily ablate the fundal endometrial wall because its 
shape does not conform to the complex configuration of the 
uterine cavity. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved 
apparatus and method for endometrial ablation. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a 
cryoprobe for ablating a human or animal body surface, 
preferably a surface of a substantially T-shaped body cavity, 
the cryoprobe comprising one or more elements adapted to 
receive refrigerant medium and which extend in use into the 
arms of the cavity. Preferably, the cavity is that of the 
human uterus. Where the probe comprises one element, that element may be 
curved kinked or bent in plan view. Where the probe comprises two elements, each element may be  
 
curved or kinked or bent, whereby the probe is substantially 
Y-shaped in use, or L-shaped in use so that the probe is 
substantially

<CLAIMS>
A cryoprobe for ablating a body surface, the cryoprobe 
comprising one or more non-linear elements adapted to receive 

refrigerant medium and arranged to conform to the body surface. 
A cryoprobe according to claim 1 for ablating a body 
surface of a substantially T-shaped body cavity having two 

minor arms, the cryoprobe comprising one or more elements 
adapted to receive a refrigerant medium and which extend(s) 

in use into the arms of the cavity. 
A cryoprobe according to claim 1 or 2 which is an 
endometrial cryoprobe. 
A cryoprobe according to any preceding claim and which 
comprises one refrigerant receiving element in which the said 

element is curved or kinked in plan view. 
A cryoprobe according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in 
which each refrigerant receiving element is curved, kinked or 

bent whereby the probe is substantially Y-shaped in use; or L-shaped 
in use so that the cryoprobe is substantially T-shaped 

in use. 
A cryoprobe according to claim 5 in which at least one 
refrigerant receiving element is flexible or articulated 

whereby it can move from a substantially straight configuration 
 

to a substantially L-shaped configuration. 
A cryoprobe according to claim 6 in which the or each 
flexible or articulated refrigerant receiving element is urged 

into the in use configuration by a resilient member. 
A cryoprobe according to claim 7 which is substantially 
T-shaped in use and in which both articulated refrigerant 

receiving elements are urged into position by resilient 
members. 
A cryoprobe according to any preceding claim in which 
the or each refrigerant receiving element is retained within 

a collar, sleeve or other cover prior to use. 
A cryoprobe according to claim 9 in which the or each 
refrigerant receiving element is held in a substantially linear 

non-use configuration within the collar, sleeve or other cover.
