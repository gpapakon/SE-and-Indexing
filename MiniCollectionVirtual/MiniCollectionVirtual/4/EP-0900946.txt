<ABSTRACT>
A rolling bearing clutch (51) including an inner ring (52),
an outer ring (53), and a plurality of rollers (54)

interposed between track surfaces (55, 56) of hyperboloidal
contour on the outer periphery of said inner ring (52) and

the inner periphery of said outer ring (53), said rollers
(54) having a twist angle relative to the center axis of said

rings (52, 53), and including a means for moving the track
surfaces (55, 56) close to each other so that said rings (52,

53), when relatively rotated in one direction, are brought
into the locked condition, said rings (52, 53) being freely

rotatable when relatively rotated in the other direction. In
order to ensure that the clutch can be disengaged even during

torque loading without a screwing-back operation, the means
for moving the track surfaces (55, 56) is a thrusting means,

such as a hydraulically operated piston (62), so that when a
thrust force is impart
ed to one of said rings (52, 53) with
said rings (52, 53) being relatively rotated in said other

direction, said clutch (51) is engaged, and when said thrust
force is released, said clutch (51) becomes disengaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rolling bearing clutch according 
to the preamble of patent claim 1. The ON/OFF operations of the clutch are performed by causing 
the track surfaces of an inner ring and an outer ring to move 
close to each other or away from each other. The Document WO-A-93 00519 describes the use of a uni-directional 
clutch of this kind in a safety coupling between an 
input shaft and an output shaft. An inner race supporting a 
plurality of thrust transmitting cylindrical rollers is fixed 
to the input shaft and surrounded by a coupling race that can 
be moved close to the inner race by means of a mechanical 
lever or an electrical actuator, causing the rollers to slide 
in their axial directions against a thrust washer on an annular 
shoulder at the end of the inner race and the clutch to 
be locked. Retraction of the coupling race separates the 
rollers from the thrust shoulder and disengages the clutch. The Document US-A-1 955 880 describes the use of a clutch of 
this kind in the transmission gearing of a motor vehicle. An 
end of a driving shaft is aligned with a shaft to be driven 
and has an outer conical surface that is surrounded by a similarly 
inclined inner conical surface of a projecting end 
portion of a hub which is slidable on and rotates with the 
shaft to be driven, cylindrical rollers being arranged between 
the conical surfaces. The actuation of a gear lever 
mechanism slides the hub to bring the conical surfaces into 
contact with the rollers and causes components of spring 
forces to retain the clutch in engagement with a firm but not 
excessive pressure. The rollers are wedged between and connect 
the cone surfaces in one direction of relative rotation, 
and release the surfaces in the other direction to permit 
free-wheeling. The gear lever mechanism disengages the 
clutch by positively retracting the hub.  
 A typical conventional rolling bearing 
clutch as shown in Fig. 4, 
includes 
an inner ring 100, an outer ring 101 and a plurality of 
rollers 104 interposed between the outer periphery of the 
inner ring 100 and the inner periphery of the outer ring 101 
as shown in Fig. 4(a). The rollers 104 are arranged in 
the inclined condition with a predetermined twist angle β 
relative to the center axis X of the inner and outer rings 
100 and 101 as shown in Fig. 4(b). A track surface 102 of 
the outer periphery of the inner ring 100 exhibits a substantially 
convergent cone-like taper surface, and a track 
surface 103 of the inner periphery of the outer ring

A rolling bearing clutch (51) including 

an inner ring (52), an outer ring (53), and a plurality 
of rollers (54) interposed between the track surfaces 

(55, 56) formed on the outer periphery of said inner ring 
(52) and the inner periphery of said outer ring (53), 

said rollers (54) being provided with a predetermined 
twist angle (β) relative to the center axis (X) of said 

inner and outer rings (52, 53), and each of the track 
surfaces (55, 56) of said inner ring (52) and said outer 

ring (53) being formed by a hyperboloid contour that is a 
revolving locus scribed when said rollers (54) are 

rotated about the center axis (X), and 
a thrusting means for moving the track surfaces (55, 56) 
of said inner ring (52) and said outer ring (53) close to 

each other, and when said inner and outer rings (52, 53)
