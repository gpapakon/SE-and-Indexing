<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid processing chemical for
a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material use
(hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as a solid
processing chemical) and particularly to a solid processing
chemical which can be supplied stably and precisely and can
also be excellent in solubility, when the solid processing
chemical is directly put into an automatic processor for
processing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as an
automatic processor).A silver halide color photographic light-sensitive
material (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a light-sensitive
material or a photographic material), after exposed
to light, is then processed in the steps such as a series of 
developing, desilvering, washing and stabilizing steps. And,
a silver halide black-and-white photographic light-sensitive
material, after exposed to light, is then processed in the
series of developing and fixing steps. In these processes, a
black-and-white developer or a color developer for carrying
out a developing step, a bleacher or a bleach-fixer for a
desilvering step, city water or deionized water for a washing
step, a stabilizer for a non-water washing step, and a
stabilizer for a dye-stabilizing step, respectively.A liquid having a processing function for carrying out
each of the above-mentioned processing steps is referred to as
a processing solution. Each of the processing solutions is
usually controlled to be a temperature within the range of 30
to 40°C, and a light-sensitive material is dipped in these
processing solutions in order, so that it can be processed.Such a process as mentioned above is commonly carried out
by transporting a light-sensitive material, by making use of
an automatic processor, through the respective processing
tanks containing the above-mentioned processing solutions in
order.The term, "an automatic processor", stated herein
generally means a processing machine having a developing unit,
a fixing unit, a desilvering unit, a washing or stabilizing
unit and a drying unit and also a means for automatically
transporting a photographic light-sensitive material in order
through each of the processing tank units. When processing a light-sensitive material by making use
of such an automatic processor as mentioned above, it has been
popular to use a system for replenishing a processing
chemical, for the purpose of keeping constant the activity of
a processing solution contained in a processing tank.As for the
