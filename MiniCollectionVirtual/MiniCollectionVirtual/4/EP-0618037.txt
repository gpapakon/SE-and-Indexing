<ABSTRACT>
An optics and environmental protection device for laser 
processing applications in which a laser processing assembly 

including a laser beam source is used to process a substrate 
(22). The laser processing assembly includes an optical 

focusing assembly (21) including at least one lens (2) located 
between the laser source and the substrate (22) for focusing 

the laser beam (1) on the substrate (22). The optics and 
environmental protection device includes a housing (23) 

defining a chamber (24) located between the optical focusing 
assembly (21) and the substrate (22). The housing (23) includes 

a first opening (25) located adjacent to the optical focusing 
assembly (21) for admitting the laser beam (1) into the chamber 

(24), a second opening (26) located adjacent to the substrate 
(22) which allows the beam (1) to exit the chamber (24), a 

third opening (29) adjacent to which a source of pressurized 
gas is located, and a fourth opening (41) adjacent to which a 

vacuum source is located. Pressurized gas and a vacuum source 
direct smoke, vapor, particles, and other debris produced by 

the laser processing away from the optical focusing assembly 
(21) and the substrate (22) and toward the fourth opening (41) 

in the housing (23). The vacuum source also removes the smoke, 
vapor, and particles from the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser process apparatus for 
selectively removing material from a substrate using a laser beam. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a device to 
protect an optical focusing assembly associated with the laser 
processing apparatus and to direct and remove smoke, particles, and 
other debris created by the process from the optical focusing 
assembly and the work area, and contain such smoke, particles, and 
debris thereby preventing them from entering the atmosphere. Lasers are used in a variety of fields for removing material 
from a substrate. Such applications include, among others, the use 
of lasers to write information onto an information storage medium 
and the formation of vias and other passages in circuit boards. 
The laser acts to remove material by burning and/or vaporization. 
Such a method allows for the very precise removal of material for 
the fabrication of a variety of components and devices. However, laser processing suffers from the drawback of 
creating smoke and other debris including a variety of oxidation 
products and particulate matter which can litter and obscure the  
 
work surface as well as enter the atmosphere. Debris lying upon a 
work surface can obscure the work surface as well as interfere with 
the impact of the laser upon the work surface. Smoke and other 
debris passing into the atmosphere can create a health hazard as 
well as an environmental hazard. Further, flying debris can impact 
with the laser and/or associated optical apparatus thereby damaging 
it and adversely affecting its efficiency. Smoke and other debris 
can also absorb the laser energy thereby negatively affecting the 
beam's effectiveness. GB-A-2 048 785 discloses an apparatus for engraving a rotating 
cylinder by means of a laser beam focused onto a small area of 
the cylinder surface by a lens. A flow of compressed air is 
directed obliquely across the path of the laser beam, and a 
suction device communicates with the region between the lens 
and the cylinder for extracting air from this region. The flow 
of air serves to remove debris from the area being engraved and 
to prevent it from reaching the lens, without causing excessive 
cooling of the cylinder surface. Therefore, it is among the objects of the present invention to 
provide an apparatus which can remove smoke and other debris 
produced by a laser ablation apparatus thereby protecting the 
apparatus as well as to remove the debris and smoke from the work 
surface and the environment.
