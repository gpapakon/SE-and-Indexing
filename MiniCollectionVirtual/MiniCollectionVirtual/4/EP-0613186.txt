<ABSTRACT>
The breakdown characteristics of a lateral transistor 
integrated in an epitaxial layer of a first type of 

conductivity grown on a substrate of an opposite type 
of conductivity and comprising a drain region formed in 

said epitaxial layer, are markedly improved without recurring 
to critical adjustments of physical parameters 

of the integrated structure by forming a buried region 
having the same type of conductivity of the substrate 

and a slightly higher level of doping at the interface 
between the epitaxial layer and the substrate in a zone 

laying beneath the drain region of the transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lateral, 
double-diffused transistor (e.g. an LDMOS) having 
improved breakdown characteristics, particularly suited 
for high voltage integrated circuits (HVIC's). Typically, high-voltage, integrated circuits 
(HVIC's) contain one or more high-voltage power transistors 
together with a low voltage signal processing 
circuitry on the same chip. The use of this type of 
integrated circuits is becoming more and more 
viable alternative to the use of a plurality of 
discrete circuits, in a wide variety of applications. In these integrated circuits, lateral, double-diffused, 
MOS transistors (LDMOS) are widely used as 
active power devices. One way to improve the voltage handling capability 
of a lateral transistor is intrinsic to a so-called 
RESURF (an acronym for REduced SURface Field) technique. 
This particular technique is described in an article 
of J. A. Appels et al., appeared on: "Philips J. 
Res. 35, 1-13, 1980". The physical structure 
of a RESURF LDMOS transistor, as depicted in 
Figures 1 and 2, is substantially identical to the 
structure of a conventional LDMOS transistor. The main 
difference between the two devices consists in the fact 
that the structure of a RESURF LDMOS is generally 
formed in a much thinner epitaxial layer than a 
conventional high voltage device. For this reason, the 
bottom-side depletion region pertaining to the junction  
 
between the epitaxial layer, for example of an 
n- conductivity, and a substrate layer, for example of 
a p- conductivity, has a significant effect on high-voltage 
withstanding capability in the case of a RESURF 
type LDMOS structure. The document US-4,300,150 discloses a lateral double 
diffused MOS transistor, the integrated structure of 
which includes field-shaping semiconductor layers. The 
field shaping layer may be a buried layer formed 
beneath the channel region of the transistor and having 
the same type of conductivity and a higher doping level 
than the substrate. Alternatively the field-shaping 
layer may be diffused in the epitaxial layer alongside 
the drain region of the transistor or the integrated 
structure may include both layers. The transistor is 
reportedly capable of having a breakdown voltage of 370 
Volts. The document EP-A-69429, describes an insulated 
gate, field effect transistor, the structure of which 
includes a buried layer of the same conductivity type 
as the epitaxial layer, formed beneath the channel 
region of the transistor and a field plate connected to 
the source
