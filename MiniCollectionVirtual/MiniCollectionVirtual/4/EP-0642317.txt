<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dispenser apparatus for 
sequentially dispensing sheet material from a plurality 
of rolls. The teachings of the invention are 
particularly applicable to coreless paper rolls and for 
automatically initiating dispensing from a reserve 
coreless paper roll in response to depletion of a 
primary coreless paper roll. It is well known in the prior art to dispense paper 
tissue, toweling and the like from coreless rolls of 
such product. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,905,868, 
issued March 6, 1990, discloses a paper towel dispenser 
including a housing accommodating a coreless roll and a 
nozzle of particular construction which defines an 
outlet through which the toweling is pulled. U.S. Patent No. 4,760,970, issued August 2, 1988, 
also discloses a dispenser for dispensing paper toweling 
or the like from a roll of such material. The web is 
pulled from the center of a roll through the bottom of 
the dispenser. An arrangement is provided to prevent 
unwanted dispensing of the web under the influence of 
gravity. Other dispensers for dispensing from coreless rolls 
of web material are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
3,627,216, issued December 14, 1971, U.S. Patent No. 
3,523,653, issued August 11, 1970, and U.S. Patent No. 
2,864,495, issued December 16, 1958.  
 All of the dispenser mechanisms shown in the above 
listed patents are for the purpose of accommodating and 
dispensing from a single coreless roll. Once that roll has 
been depleted an attendant must refill the dispenser with 
another roll. This is highly undesirable since a person 
wishing to use a towel or tissue, whichever the case may be, 
will find that none is available in the interim between roll 
depletion and replacement. On the other hand, replacement 
before depletion results in waste. While it is known in the prior art to store a plurality 
of paper toweling or tissue rolls in a cabinet, and in some 
cases effect automatic transfer therebetween, some of these 
arrangements do not readily lend themselves to use with 
coreless rolls, while in other cases such transfer 
mechanisms are characterized by their relative complexity 
and high expense. A search of the prior art located the 
following dispensers for dispensing toilet tissue and the 
like which accommodate a plurality of such rolls: U.S. 
Patent No. 2,991,951, issued July 11, 1961, U.S. Patent No. 
4,177,958, issued December 11, 1979, and U.S. Patent No. 
2,908,451, issued October 31, 1959. A search directed to the present invention also located 
the

<CLAIMS>
In combination: 

dispenser means (10) defining a dispensing 
aperture (22) in a housing (12); 
a first coreless roll (44) of sheet material 
disposed in the housing (12) in operative association with 

said dispenser means (10) and including a lead end (50) 
and a tail end (52), said lead end projectable outwardly 

from the center of said first coreless roll for passage 
through said dispensing aperture (22); and 
a second coreless roll (46) of sheet material 
including a lead end (56) and a tail end (58), the tail 

end (52) of said first coreless roll (44) being connected 
to the lead end (56) of said second coreless roll (46) 

whereby said second coreless roll lead end will follow 
said first coreless roll tail end through said dispensing 

aperture upon depletion of said first coreless roll and 
said first and second coreless rolls are sequentially 

dispensed through said dispensing aperture, characterized 
by a support platform (34) disposed in said housing (12) 

intermediate said first and second roll for supporting 
said second roll (46) above said first roll and with the 

support platform (34) having a central opening (36) in 
alignment with said dispensing aperture which diverges 

outwardly toward the housing (12) to facilitate access for 
readily repositioning the second roll upon depletion of 

the first roll and for attaching the second roll to the 
new roll during servicing of the dispensing means. 
The combination according to Claim I wherein 
said first and second coreless rolls are in general axial 

alignment relative to each other and relative to said 
dispensing aperture further characterized in that said 

first roll being urged against the dispenser means 
defining the dispensing aperture by gravity.  

 
The combination according to Claim 2 wherein 
said second coreless roll 

is vertically mounted over the said first coreless roll.
