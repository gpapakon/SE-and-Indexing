<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire essentially has a luminaire chamber (2) with a lamp holder (8) arranged in its wall (7) and with a metallic screen element (14), which is impenetrable for microwaves, is arranged in the region of the luminaire opening (6), is removable from the luminaire opening, and makes contact with the luminaire wall (7). According to the invention, the screen element (14) covers only a part of the luminaire opening (6), specifically the region where the lamp (4) is positioned.

Light for microwave ovens with a lamp chamber, which is fastened 
at the oven muffle and in the wall of which serving as reflector, 

there is arranged a lamp holder which is accessible from the oven 
chamber and the lamp disposed situated therein is covered by a 

metallic screening element, which is impermeable by microwaves, makes 
contact with the wall and is arranged in the region of the lamp 

opening, which faces the oven chamber, and to be withdrawable out of 
this, characterised thereby that the screening element (14) covers 

only a part of the lamp opening (6) and namely the position region of 
the lamp (4), wherein the lamp (4) is not enclosed by the screening 

element (14) so that the light can issue unhindered through the not 
covered region. 
Light for microwave ovens with a lamp chamber, which is fastened 
at the oven muffle and in the wall of which serving as reflector, 

there is arranged a lamp holder which is accessible from the oven 

chamber and the lamp disposed situated therein is covered by a 
metallic screening element, which is impermeable by microwaves, makes 

contact with the wall and is arranged in the region of the lamp 
opening, which faces the oven chamber, and to be withdrawable out of 

this, characterised thereby that the screening element (50), which 
partially covers the lamp opening, consists of a unit which is 

tiltable away and formed of a perforated metal casing (51) and a 
crinkly foil (52). 
Light according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
screening element (14), with the exception of the wall (7) standing 

in contact with the screening element, is spaced at all sides from 
the rim of the lamp opening (6). 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the screening element (14) is provided with 

perforations (23) permitting a passage of light. 
Light according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that the  
 

screening element (14) is formed as perforated sheet metal part of 
stable shape and borne at the wall (7), which displays the lamp 

holder (8), of the lamp chamber (2) to be tiltable out of the lamp 
opening (6). 
Light according to claim 5, characterised thereby, that the 
screening element (14) is borne to be tiltable at a metallic carrier 

(12), which is fastened at the wall (7) and partially surrounds the 
lamp holder (8), and in the closed setting is urged against an 

abutment (20) of the carrier (12) by means of spring force (25). 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the screening element (14) is provided in the axial 

region with arcuate spring lobes (16), which partially surround the 
tilt axle (13) and at least in the closed setting bear against the 

adjacent wall (7). 
Light according to one of the claims 1, 3 and 4, characterised 
thereby, that a flexible contact foil (29) or a metal spring plate 

acting as restoring spring is provided between the tilt axle (13) and 
the adjacent wall (7). 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the tilt axle (13) of the screening element (14) 

projects through at least one wall (7') of the lamp chamber and 
outside the lamp chamber stand in operative connection with elements, 

such as springs (25), abutments (22') or the like, which cause and/or 
limit a tilting movement into the closed setting. 
Light according to claim 9, characterised thereby, that the tilt 
axle projects through the wall at only one side and is borne in a 

pressed-out concavity at the opposite wall. 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the lamp (4) is a high-voltage halogen lamp. 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised  
 

thereby, that a transparent cover (30) is placed on the lamp opening 
(6) to be removable and consists of a glass plate (33) with a frame 

(34), which consists of metallic spring material, is firmly mounted 
on the side facing the lamp opening and as integral components 

comprises spring cheeks (38), which project freely and surround the 
frame opening (36) at least for the largest part, and at least two 

likewise resilient detent elements (39), which lie against oppositely 
disposed frame limbs and by which the cover (30) is tightenable to a 

bearing surface which surrounds the lamp opening (6) in the manner of 
a frame and is provided with counterdetent elements (40). 
Light according to claim 12, characterised thereby, that an 
electrically non-conductive insulating frame (41), which covers over 

the entire frame, is pluggable onto the detent elements (39) of the 
frame (34). 
Light according to one of the claims 12 and 15, characterised 
thereby, that a metallic plate (31), which extends around the lamp 

opening (6) in the manner of a frame and is firmly tightened to a 
circumferential flange (5), which bounds the lamp opening (6), in a 

given case with the interposition of the opening rim of an opening 
provided for the lamp in the oven muffle wall (10), is provided as 

bearing surface for the cover (30). 
Light according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the 
crinkly foil (52) forms a microwave-tight closure place between the 

reflector wall of the lamp chamber and the perforated metal casing 
(51) and in that case protects a restoring spring against discharges 

due to field intensity.
