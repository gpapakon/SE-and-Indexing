<ABSTRACT>
In the passage of a steel strip through a continuous strip treatment plant, the "good side" of the strip is occasionally turned, for the purpose of checking, from the bottom side to the top side, or vice versa. Between stations of the plant, the strip is introduced into a strip-turning tower and is guided in the latter successively over vertically spaced upper and lower deflection rollers, being twisted in the process from roller to roller by in each case an angular amount, in such a way that between strip entry and strip exit it is set into any desired angle and is occasionally twisted in such a way that, after deflection through 180@, the bottom side of the strip on entry into the first roller is turned to the top side of the strip on exit, and vice versa. The device provided for this has a strip-turning tower (20), of similar construction to a vertical looping store, with a number of vertically spaced upper (21) and lower (22) strip deflection rollers, the rollers being arranged rotated in the running direction of the strip (30) from roller (21) to roller (22) by angular amounts (Phi1 to Phin), in the same direction, relative to the strip entry axis (x-x), in such a way that the strip (30), on winding round in each case one roller pair formed by a lower (22) and an upper (21) roller, is twisted by the angular amount (Phi) and if all of the twisting angular amounts are added up it is eventually turned through 180@.
