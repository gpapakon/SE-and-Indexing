<ABSTRACT>
For the transport of samples to different treating arrangements (for example 5), a circulating conveyor belt (13) with sample carriers (21) circulating thereupon is led past the treating arrangements (for example 5). Each sample carrier (21) is provided with a data carrier (23), in which data for the identification of the transported sample and of the treatment steps intended for it or carried out in the treating arrangements (for example 5) are stored. Each treating arrangement (for example 5) is assigned a writing/reading station (24), which reads the data from the data carriers (23) of incoming sample carriers (21) and, dependent thereon, activates a handling device (29) for the transport of the sample carrier (21) to the treating arrangement (5). The data are buffer-stored and the sample carrier (21) now marked as empty, is set back again on the conveyor belt (13). Once treatment of the sample has taken place, an empty sample carrier (21) is stopped to receive the treated sample and is marked with the buffer-stored data and new data.
