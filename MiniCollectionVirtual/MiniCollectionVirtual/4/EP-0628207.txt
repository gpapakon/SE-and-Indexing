<ABSTRACT>
A helical tape recording and reproducing system which has longitudinal physical address track (174) for recording physical address data relating to the physical layout of the tape and a logical address track (172) that contains data relating to the content of the recorded helical tracks. Each address track has recorded segments with each of said segments containing data corresponding to a particular pair of helical tracks recorded in said helical recording area. Each segment has a multiple bit front field of a first predetermined timing synchronization bit pattern, a first predefined synchronizing word, a multiple bit segment information field of data, a second predefined synchronizing word and a multiple bit rear field of a second predetermined timing synchronization bit pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more 
particularly, to recording and reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high 
density recording of digital information at very high transfer rates.  
 The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever 
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous 
industries ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing 
power of these high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster 
than the ability of storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid 
retrieval is particularly pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create 
huge amounts of data that need to be accessed in seconds rather than minutes, hours or 
even days. Magnetic disks remain the preferred media for direct access to frequently 
used files because of their fast access times. However, because of their high cost per-unit 
of storage (such as a megabyte) and their limited capacity, magnetic disk recorders are 
prohibitively expensive and therefore impractical for large-scale data storage. With the 
advances in magnetic tape technology, tape based systems remain the preferred choice for 
mass data storage. In addition to cost, magnetic tape exceeds the storage density of any 
other medium, at least from a volumetric standpoint, because tape is a much thinner 
medium than, for example, magnetic disks, and tape can be tightly packed. A general 
discussion of such technology may be found in Mass Storage Technologies, by S. 
Ranada, published in 1991 by Meckler Publishing. The tape format basically defines the recording path used to record signals 
on the tape. There are many different recording formats developed for data recording and 
reproducing. A commonly used format for high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multitrack 
tape cartridge format in which the tape transport employs a stationary head and 
records data along longitudinal tracks. Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan 
recorders, a technology developed originally for video recorders, have been used for 
recording data. In helical scan recorders, the tape is transported past a rapidly rotating 
head along a helical path whereby data is recorded diagonally across the tape. Compared 
to longitudinal recorders, helical scan recorders generate high recording densities and 
lower tape speeds for a given data transfer rate. Such systems are described in 
IEEE
