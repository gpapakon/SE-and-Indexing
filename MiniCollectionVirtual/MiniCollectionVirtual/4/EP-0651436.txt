<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming tungsten plugs and layers is disclosed. A thin 
layer of polysilicon or amorphous silicon (e.g., 15) is formed within a contact 

opening. The silicon is exposed to WF₆, thereby forming a tungsten plug (e.g., 21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of semiconductor integrated circuit 
processing in general, and more particularly to integrated circuit processing methods 
which involve the use of tungsten conductors. Tungsten has become an increasingly popular material for 
semiconductor integrated circuit metallization. Tungsten has often been found 
superior to aluminum for the filling of vias and/or windows. There are two 
commonly used methods for forming tungsten. The first method, often termed 
"blanket tungsten" involves the reaction of tungsten hexaflouride (WF₆) and silane 
on an underlying nucleating substrate layer of TiN or TiW. The reaction produces a 
blanket layer of tungsten upon a substrate surface. The second method for forming 
tungsten, often termed "selective tungsten" involves the reaction of tungsten 
hexaflouride with silicon - typically a crystalline silicon substrate upon which 
integrated circuits are formed. Those who employ selective tungsten to form a tungsten contact to a 
source/drain region (or other active silicon semiconductor region), often discover the 
subsequent formation of "worm holes." A worm hole is a microscopic tunnel formed 
in the silicon. The worm hole usually contains a small amount of tungsten material 
at its remote end. The presence of worm holes can destroy semiconductor junction 
integrity. In an attempt to alleviate the worm hole problem, designers frequently 
deposit one or more barrier or glue layers within a window. The barrier or glue layer 
covers the exposed silicon of the source/drain region and helps to avoid the 
formation of worm holes. However, the presence of the barrier or glue layer 
precludes the use of selective tungsten because the crystalline silicon substrate is 
covered by the barrier or glue layer and therefore unavailable for reaction with WF₆. 
Consequently, a blanket tungsten reaction must be employed if a barrier/glue layer is 
used in a window. A typically used barrier/glue layer is a bilayer of titanium/titanium 
nitride. Titanium is deposited within the window first. Then a layer of titanium 
nitride is formed atop the titanium. Next, a blanket tungsten layer is formed in 
contact with the titanium nitride layer. However, the first-deposited titanium layer 
forms a silicide with the underlying silicon substrate. The silicide formation may be 
undesirable if the underlying junction is extremely shallow.  Designers have consistently sought better methods of tungsten 
deposition. The present invention provides a method of forming
