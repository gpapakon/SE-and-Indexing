<ABSTRACT>
The fuzzy logic controller of analogue type makes it possible to implement a set of behavioural rules whose output values are polynomial functions of the input variables. The controller operates by determining firstly the weights of the various rules, and then by evaluating a global value for each of the coefficients of the polynomials yielding the output values of the various rules. Finally, the controller yields a global output value determined by evaluating the value of a polynomial whose coefficients are the global values evaluated above.

<CLAIMS>
Analog fuzzy logic controller implementing a set
of fuzzy rules with which are respectively associated

output values expressed as many polynomials, the
coefficients of said polynomials having predetermined

values specific to the different rules, and each of said
rules including at least one condition consisting of a

fuzzy relationship, more or less true, between one of said
input variables (x) and a reference value (p), said

controller comprising :

first means for determining the weight of each of
the fuzzy rules, said weight being determined by combining

results of comparison of the values of the input variables
with the reference values in the different conditions of

said rule; said controller being characterized in that it
further comprises:
second means for estimating, for each of said
coefficients, a global value of said coefficient, said

global value being determined starting from the different
values of said coefficient in the different rules, taking

into account said respective weights of said rules, and
third means for delivering, as output of said
controller, the value of a polynomial in said set of input

variables, the coefficients of said polynomial being said
global values delivered by said second means.
Analog fuzzy logic controller according to claim
1, characterized in that the output values of said set of

rules are expressed as polynomials of degree 1.
Analog fuzzy logic controller according to claim
1, characterized in that said second means determine the

global value of each coefficient by a center of gravity
calculation.
