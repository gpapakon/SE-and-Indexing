<ABSTRACT>
Device (1) for carrying equipment such as a flowmeters (6 and 
7) through a conduit (2) comprising an elongated body (5) provided 

with the flowmeters (6 and 7), an active centralizing system to 
position the elongated body (2) in the conduit (5) and a position 

control system that causes the active centralizing system to adjust 
the position of the elongated body (2), wherein the active 

centralizing system comprises two support arms (15 and 18) located 
near the ends of the elongated body (5) and two support arms (16 

and 17) located near the middle of the elongated body (5), each 
support arm (15, 16, 17 and 18) being provided with adjusting means 

controlled by the position control system to adjust the extension

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for carrying equipment, 
for example a flowmeter, through a conduit. Such a device 
comprises elongated body provided with the equipment, a passive 
centralizing system to position the elongated body in the conduit 
so that the position of its central longitudinal axis relative to 
the position of the central longitudinal axis of the conduit is 
maintained within a predetermined range. The predetermined range is 
smaller than the diameter of the elongated body. Such a device for carrying a flowmeter through a conduit is for 
example described in SPE paper No. 5089 entitled 'The full bore 
flowmeter' by B C Leach, J B Jameson, J J Smolen and Y Nicolas, 
American Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum Engineers, 
Inc, 1974. In the known device the passive centralizing system 
comprises six protective centralizer skids and six centralizer 
arms, which are with one end connected to the longitudinal body by 
axially displaceable hinges, the other end of each arm being 
mechanically linked to a protective centralizer skid. The protective 
centralizer skids are pushed against the inner surface of the 
conduit by the centralizer arms which are actuated by springs. The 
central longitudinal axis of the elongated body is maintained 
within a predetermined range from the central longitudinal axis of 
the conduit by the reaction forces between the outer surface of the 
protective centralizer cage and the inner surface of the conduit. 
These reaction forces not only depend on the relative position of 
the central longitudinal axis of the elongated body but also on 
uncertain quantities such as variations in spring stiffness and the 
friction in the axially displaceable hinges. As a result the 
magnitudes of the reaction forces are undetermined and consequently 
precise positioning of the central longitudinal axis of the elongated 
body is not possible.  It is an object of the present invention to overcome this 
disadvantage. To this end the device for carrying equipment through a conduit 
according to the present invention comprises an elongated body 
provided with the equipment, an active centralizing system to 
position the elongated body in the conduit and a position control 
system that causes the active centralizing system to adjust the 
position of the elongated body if the position of its central 
longitudinal axis relative to the position of the central longitudinal 
axis of the conduit is outside a predetermined range, wherein 
the active centralizing system

Device for carrying equipment through a conduit comprising an 
elongated body provided with the equipment, an active centralizing 

system to position the elongated body in the conduit and a position 
control system that causes the active centralizing system to adjust 

the position of the elongated body if the position of its central 
longitudinal axis relative to the position of the central longitudinal 

axis of the conduit is outside a predetermined range, wherein
