<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to a low-shaft furnace for the disposal of filter dusts, filter sludges and filter ashes. In order to be able to obtain the charge quantity of such filter materials in the slags of the low-shaft furnaces and to recover a maximum quantity of valuable materials from the slag, it is proposed that the material for disposal is charged onto or into the slag bath, that simultaneously additives are introduced into the slag via an immersion lance and that, during the charging of the additives, the parameters determining the electric resistance, namely the height of the slag bath and the depth of immersion of the electrodes, are adjusted in a special way. For this purpose, the electrodes (21-26) have a defined diameter (D), and at least one delivery pipe (31-33) of a disposal feeder device (30) is provided in the upper part of the furnace vessel (12) underneath the cover (13). Parallel to the electrodes (21-26), a lance (41,47-49) is fixed to a support arm (43), which lance is connected to a burdening ring (42) and communicates via a sliding seal (14) with the furnace cover (13).

A method for disposing of filter materials, in
particular from the metallurgical industry or from

refuse combustion plants, in which the material for
disposal is brought into contact with molten slag from

an electric low-shaft furnace,

characterised by the following steps:

a) the material for disposal is charged on to and/or
into the slag bath by means of a charging means,
b) at the same time, fluxes, slag-forming
constituents and additives containing reducing

agents are introduced into the slag via a separate
immersed lance,
c) during the charging of the additives, the
variables forming the electrical resistance,

essentially the electrode diameter and distance
between electrode centres, the ratio of electrode

diameter (D) to the distance between electrode
centres (M) being D/M = 0.25-0.35, the height of

the slag bath and the immersion depth of the
electrodes, are adjusted such that 70% of the

electrical energy is introduced between electrodes
and 30% of the electrical energy is introduced

between electrodes and the metal bath located on
the hearth bottom.

that additional additives and/or materials for disposal
are charged via the electrodes, which are provided with

hollow bores. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the additives are introduced into the centre of

the highest energy concentration.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the additives can be introduced into the slag bath

that electricity is introduced into the melt bath via

the immersed lance in addition to the electrodes.
