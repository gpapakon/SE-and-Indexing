<ABSTRACT>
The percussion tool has a piston (15) which oscillates in the cylinder (10). In order to determine which piston surface of the piston (15) impinges on the head (7) of a tool holder (2) and thus to determine whether the percussion tool generates forward percussions or backward percussions the cylinder (10) is pneumatically displaced in the housing (1) of the percussion tool. The displacement takes place as a function of the position of an actuating element (21). This type of adjustment of the percussion direction is simple and permits firm mounting of the tool holder (2) in the housing (1), so that the percussion tool is stable.

Pneumatic battering tool, particularly for
surgical use, with a casing (1), a piston/cylinder assembly

with a pneumatically driven oscillating piston (15),
and with a tool holder (2) which carries tool holding

means (3) outside of the casing and which within the casing
forms two impact surfaces (8, 9) for the piston in

order to selectively generate forward directed or backward
directed strikes, characterized in that the tool

holder (2) is essentially immobilised in the casing (1),
that the cylinder (10) is an element separate from the

casing and displaceable within it, and that manually operable
switch means (21) are provided which when actuated

are able to displace the cylinder, whereby the piston
(15) which is urged pneumatically to oscillate in the

cylinder will, according to the displaced position of the
cylinder, hit either one of the impact surfaces (8, 9)

depending on the displacement of the cylinder.
Pneumatic battering tool according to
claim 1, characterized in that the displacement of the

cylinder is obtained through pneumatic pressure.
Pneumatic battering tool according to
claim 2, characterized in that the switch means comprise

a valve which in one position delivers compressed air to
at least one annular surface (35, 36) of the outer cylinder

wall, and which in another position delivers compressed
air to a frontal surface (27) of the outer cylinder

wall.
Pneumatic battering tool according to one
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a first chamber

(34) continuously fed with compressed air is provided between
the casing and the outer wall of the cylinder, and

that at least two passages (38, 39) spaced apart in the 
longitudinal direction of the cylinder lead from the

chamber to the inside of the cylinder.
Pneumatic battering tool according to one
of claims 3 and 4, characterized in that the annular surface

(35, 36) of the cylinder is part of the wall of said
chamber.
Pneumatic battering tool according to one
of claims 4 or 5, characterized in that the piston (15)

is a stepped piston which oscillates in a way controlled
by compressed air which acts continuously on an annular

piston surface (47) and only intermittently on the frontal
surface (41) of the piston, and in that the annular

piston surface is acted upon by compressed air delivered
from the chamber through one (38) of the passages.
Pneumatic battering tool according to
claim 6, characterized in that the frontal surface (41)

of the piston is acted upon intermittently by compressed
air delivered through a control line (46) controlled by

the piston.
Pneumatic battering tool according to
claim 7, characterized in that the control line comprises

several channels (46) in the piston, which channels intermittently
communicate with the chamber (34) through

the second passage (39), depending on the movement of the
piston.
Pneumatic battering tool according to one
of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the tool holder

(2) is fixedly maintained against the action of transversal
forces through a block-shaped bearing means (4) fixed

in the casing (1), and that it is maintained in the axial
direction by springs (5) or elastic rubber or plastic

elements inserted between the casing and the block-shaped
bearing means.
