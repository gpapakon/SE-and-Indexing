<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device whereby on a surface 
(3) of a semiconductor body (1) a conductor track (21) of polycrystalline silicon 

insulated from the surface (3) is provided in a layer of doped polycrystalline silicon (11) 
provided on a layer of insulating material (10), and whereby a strip of polycrystalline 

silicon (19, 35) is formed between an edge (18) of the conductor (21) and a portion (24, 
34) of the surface (3) adjoining the edge (18), after which a semiconductor zone (30) is 

formed through diffusion of dopant from the conductor (21) through the strip (19, 35) 
into the semiconductor body (1). During the formation of the insulated conductor (21) 

and the strip of polycrystalline silicon (19, 35), a window (15) is etched into the layer 
of polycrystalline silicon (11) by means of a first etching mask (13), after which the 

insulating layer (10) is removed from the surface (3) within the window (15), the 
window (15) is provided at its edge (18) with a strip of polycrystalline silicon (19, 35), 

and the conductor (21) is etched into the layer of polycrystalline silicon (11) by means 
of a second etching mask (20), this second etching mask (20) covering at least a portion 

of the edge (18) of the window (15). Further conductors (22, 23) may be formed in the 
polycrystalline layer (11) next to the insulated conductor (21), all conductors (21, 22, 

23) being given dimensions such as defined by the second etching mask (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor 
device whereby on a surface of a semiconductor body a conductor track of 
polycrystalline silicon insulated from the surface is formed in a layer of doped 
polycrystalline silicon provided on a layer of insulating material, and whereby a strip of 
polycrystalline silicon is formed between an edge of the conductor and a portion of the 
surface adjoining said edge, after which a semiconductor zone is formed in the 
semiconductor body through diffusion of dopant from the conductor through the strip. A strip of polycrystalline silicon with a very small width of, for example, 
less than 100 nm may be provided between the edge of the insulated conductor and the 
portion of the surface adjoining this edge. The semiconductor zone formed through 
diffusion will accordingly be very narrow, having a width of approximately 150 nm. 
The method may be used, for example, for the manufacture of a bipolar transistor with 
a very narrow emitter zone, also called ribbon emitter, which is suitable for the 
amplification of very high-frequency signals. In practice, said method is particularly suitable for the manufacture of 
integrated circuits which comprise besides bipolar transistors having a very narrow 
emitter zone also other semiconductor elements such as field effect transistors. Besides a 
pattern of conductors from which said narrow semiconductor zones are formed, 
accordingly, a pattern of conductors may be provided in the layer of polycrystalline 
silicon which comprises, for example, gate electrodes of field effect transistors. EP-A-493,853 discloses a method of the kind mentioned in the opening 
paragraph whereby the conductor is etched into the layer of doped polycrystalline 
silicon by means of a first etching mask during the formation of the insulated conductor 
and the strip of polycrystalline silicon. Then the layer of insulating material is etched 
away next to the edge of the conductor from the surface of the semiconductor body by 
means of a second etching mask at the area of the semiconductor zone to be formed. 
Finally, the conductor is provided along its entire edge with the strip of polycrystalline  
 
silicon. Wherever the surface is exposed, the strip of polycrystalline silicon is then 
present between the edge of the conductor and the portion of the surface adjoining this 
edge. The semiconductor zone will be formed there during a subsequent heat treatment. When the known method is used in the manufacture of semiconductor 
device
