<ABSTRACT>
The device combines a compensation device, which is located in the longitudinal centre axis (FML) of the bogie frame (2), with a centering device located above the centre of the bogie frame. This is to accommodate the opposite vertical movements of the outer transverse struts (2b) of the frame, which result from the drive or braking momentum, for the prevention of galloping, stabilize the individual bogie, and guarantee the cross movement of the waggon body above the transverse vehicle axis. The compensation device consists of a pendulum arrangement (6), with a coupling element, which acts as torsion bar (7). The arrangement is formed by hinged bars (6a,b), and the position of the bars on the transverse struts is determined by U-shaped holder units (8).

Individual running gear for rail vehicles, particularly for local tracks and regional
tracks, wherein the two-stage sprung individual running gear connected to the coach body

is constructed as a wheel set running gear or single wheel running gear, characterised by
the combination of a compensating device (K), which is arranged in the region of the

running gear centre longitudinal axis (RML) of the running gear frame (
2
), with a centring
device (Z), which is arranged above the centre of the running gear frame (
2
), for reception
of the oppositely directed vertical movement of the outer crossbeam (2b) of the running

gear frame (
2
), which result from the drive or braking moments, in order to avoid pitching
and to stabilise the individual running gear, as well as for guaranteeing the transverse

movement of the coach body by way of the running gear transverse axis.
Individual running gear according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the
compensating device (K) is formed from a pendulating arrangement (
6
) with a coupling
alement serving as a torsion bar (7), wherein the pendulating arrangement (
6
) is formed by
pivotably mounted links (6a and 6b), the lateral position of which is determined on the one

hand at the crossbeams (2b) of the running gear frame (
2
) itself by the direct arrangement
of downwardly pointing receiving devices (8), which are constructed to be U-shaped, on

the running gear centre longitudinal axis (FML), and thereby that the ends of the coupling
element constructed as torsion bar (7) on the other hand receive the opposite side of links

(6a and 6b), in that each end region of the torsion bar (7) in turn has a receiving device (9)
constructed to be U-shaped, wherein the open sides of both receiving devices (8 and 9),

which are constructed to be U-shaped, for the bearings (10 and 11) of the links (6a and
6b) are offset relative to one another in the rest setting by 90° on a centre perpendicular

line (MS).
Individual running gear according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the
pendulating arrangement (
6
) is formed from pneumatically or hydraulically actuated
adjusting cylinders with adjusting pistons, wherein the coupling of both partial systems is

effected by way of pneumatic, hydraulic or other force-transmitting elements.
Individual running gear according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby
that the centring device (Z) is formed from a rocker (13) guided by way of links (12a and

12b), and that at on the one hand the fastening of the rocker (13) to the coach body (1) is 
effected by way of a radial bearing (14) arranged vertically in the rocker (13) and on the

other hand a resilient guidance of the rocker (13) itself is effected by way of the equal
length links (12a and 12b), which are arranged diagonally opposite, and by way of

brackets (15a and 15b) relative to the crossbeams (2b) of the running gear frame (
2
), and
that the two ends of the rocker (13) point towards a defined region of the crossbeams (2b)

of the running gear (
2
), where U-shaped brackets (16a and 16b) are arranged, wherein
pivot axes (17) of the brackets (15a and 15b or 16a and 16b) for reception of the bearings

(11) of the links (12a and 12b) lie offset relative to one another by 90°.
Individual running gear according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby
that a ball-race turntable finds use for formation of the fulcrum (D) of bogie to coach body.
Individual running gear according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterised thereby
that the torsion rod (7) used as coupling element is rotatably mounted in the coach body

(1).
Individual running gear according to one of claims 4 or 5, characterised thereby
that the torsion rod (7) used as coupling element is mounted to be horizontally rotatable in

the running gear frame (
2
) and the links (12a and 12b) are pivotably connected with the
coach body (1).
Individual running gear according to one of claims 2 and 4 to 7, characterised
thereby that the bearings (10 and 11) of the links (6a and 6b) are used with a reaction-free

characteristic.
