<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a device for determining the rotational speed gradient dn/dt of a shaft of an internal combustion engine, where the rotational speed gradient dn/dt is determined in the control unit as a function of the cube of the engine speed and the difference of two segment times, the speed gradient being determined only in time-uncritical phases, whereas in the time-critical phases only segment times are read or stored so that in these time-critical phases the data required for the control of the internal combustion engine can be computed independently of the engine speed determination.

<CLAIMS>
Method for determining the speed gradient (dn/dt) 
of a shaft driven by an internal combustion engine and to 

which there is connected an increment disc which has a 
multiplicity of identical angle marks on its surface, a 

prescribable number of angle marks forming a segment and 
the angle marks being scanned by a sensor to generate a 

speed-dependent pulse train, having a computer in which 
the temporal spacings between selectible pulses or 

between similar pulse edges of the pulse train are 
determined and the temporal spacings correspond to 

segment times, a segment time in each case being the time 
in which the crank shaft of the internal combustion 

engine rotates by an angle of 360Â°/z/2, z being the 
number of cylinders of the internal combustion engine, it 

being the case that in a time-critical pattern the 
computer continuously determines with segment timing, as 

a function of these times, parameters which are required 
for controlling and/or regulating the internal combustion 

engine, characterized in that the speed gradient (dn/dt) 
is determined in a non-critical time pattern. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the computer is the control unit of the internal 

combustion engine. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the speed gradient (dn/dt) is formed as a function 

of the third power of the speed (n) and the difference 
between the current segment time (t
seg
(i)) and a previous 
segment time (t
seg
(i-1)). 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the constant (K) and/or the constant (K
2
) are stored  
 

in a non-volatile memory of the computer. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the speed gradient dn/dt is calculated 

in the control unit in accordance with the formula: 

ngrad = dn/dt = n

/k

*[t
