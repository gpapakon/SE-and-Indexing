<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to means for jointing a bundle 
of longitudinal elements, such as a composite electrical/fiber 

optic cable. A fiber optic jointing cabinet (21,58) is fitted 
to a cradle-like structure (20,59) encompassing a bundle 

(27,50) of the remaining longitudinal elements. An outer 
housing (23,24) encompassing the cabinet/cradle (21,20;58,59) 

structure has threaded areas for providing controlled 
tensioning of armour wires.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means for jointing a 
bundle of longitudinal elements and in particular to means for 
jointing a composite electrical/optical cable. Such composite 
electrical/optical cables may have three or more insulated 
power conductors and one or more fiber optic cables and other 
longitudinal elements arranged within a common armouring. If 
one of the elements in a bundle is damaged, it may be 
necessary to cut the bundle and make a controlled joint of all 
elements, in order to obtain equal tension in all elements and 
the protecting armour. If the optical part of a composite 
cable is damaged, a repair will most probably also require 
jointing of the power part of the cable. Composite cables of the type concerned are frequently used 
in offshore installations and the jointing procedures must be 
as simple as possible to make reliable joints. Jointing 
procedures for damaged submarine cables usually require 
cutting of the cable at the sea bottom, while making sure that 
sea water does not penetrate into the cut cable ends, - 
bringing a first cut end to the surface, - jointing this first 
cut end to one end of a short length of a fresh cable, - 
bringing the second cut end to the surface, - jointing this 
second cut end to the other end of the fresh cable length, - 
and finally lowering the jointed cable to the sea bottom. It should be well understood that handling of the two 
joints, and the bight between the two joints, on a cable ship, 
can be a rather difficult task, - in particular in rough 
weather and high sea. The object of the present invention is 
to provide improved means for jointing a bundle of 
longitudinal elements such as a composite cable of the type 
described. The features of the invention are defined in the 
accompanying claims. A bundle of longitudinal elements such as 
a composite cable of the type described can be efficiently 
jointed with a minimum amount of time. One advantage of the 
invention is also that tensioning of the armour wires are 
simplified and improved. The part of the composite joint 
comprising the jointing cabinet for the fiber optic cable is 
short and will easily pass over the bow wheel of a cable ship.  Above mentioned and other features and objects of the 
present invention will clearly appear from the following 
detailed description of embodiments of the invention taken in 
conjunction with the drawings, where 
Figure 1 illustrates a length of a composite cable, Figure 2 shows a crossection of a cable, Figure 3 shows a crossection

that it includes at least one fiber optic jointing cabinet 
(21,58) fitted to a cradle-like structure (20,59) encompassing 

the power conductor bundle (27,50). 
Means according to claim 1,characterized in that 
the cabinet (21) has a bottom part (40) fitted to the 

curvature of said remaining bundle (27).

the outer surface of the cabinet/cradle structure 

(21,58;20,59) with a lid (43) is substantially circular. 
Means according to claim 1,characterized in that 
the cabinet (21,58) is made of sea water resistant material 

such as stainless steel and that the cradle (20,59) is made of 
a polyamide such as nylon. 
Means according to claim 1,characterized in that 
it comprises an outer housing (23,24) encompassing the 

cabinet/cradle (21,20;58,59) structure. 
Means according to claim 8,characterized in that 
the outer housing comprises a first (25) and a second part 

(26) having arrangements for terminating cable armouring (31), 
as well as a third (23) and a fourth (24) part which are 

rotatable relatively to each other and to the first and second 
parts. 
Means according to claim 9,characterized in that 
the rotatable third and fourth parts (23,24) are interconnected 

with a threaded area (32) so as to enable controlled 
tensioning of the armour (31). 
Means according to claim 9,characterized in that 
the third and/or fourth parts (23,24) are provided with 

through-holes (33,34) enabling use of tools for rotating said 
parts on their threads, and for enabling filling of voids
