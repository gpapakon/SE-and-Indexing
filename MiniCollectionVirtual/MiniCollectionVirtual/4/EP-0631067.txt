<ABSTRACT>
Belts (10) which exhibit a basic body (11) with the smooth outer surface (12), on which a profiling is arranged, are known. According to the invention, the profiling is formed by a sheathing body (13) which encloses the outer surface (12) of the basic body (11). As a result, the belt (10) can transmit high drive forces and conveying forces. The belt (10) is thus particularly suitable as a drive belt or transporting belt.

<CLAIMS>
Belt comprising a main body (11) having a smooth 
circumferential surface (12) and a profiling associated 

with the circumferential surface (12) and formed by an 
envelope body (13, 20, 23, 26, 29) which surrounds the 

circumferential surface (12) of the main body (11), 

characterized in that the envelope body (13, 20, 23, 26, 
29) is formed as a separate netting tube having at least 

two intercrossing strands (16). 
Belt according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the strands (16) are joined to one another at preferably 

all of the common crossing points (17). 
Belt according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the strands (16) are arranged in different layers 

(14, 15) or planes, the strands (16) of the one layer 
(14, 15) preferably intercrossing with the strands (16) 

of the other layer (14, 15). 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the strands (16) in the respective 

layer (14, 15) extend substantially parallel. 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that all the strands (16) of the respective 

layer (14, 15) are spaced apart. 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the strands (16) of the inner layer 

(14) extend in the axial direction of the main body (11) 
and the strands (16) in the outer layer (15) extend 

transversely to the axial direction of the main body 
(11). 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the strands (16) of at least one of  

 
the layers (14, 15), preferably of both layers, have a 

uniform cross section. 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the cross section of the strands 

(16) is triangular, circular, elliptical or rectangular. 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the envelope body (13, 20, 23, 26, 

29) is at least partly joined to the main body (11). 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the inside diameter of the envelope 

body (13, 20, 23, 26, 29) or of the netting tube is 
slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the main 

body (11). 
Belt according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the envelope body (13, 20, 23, 26, 

29) is formed from a material which has different properties 
to the material of the main body (11), the 

material of the envelope body (13, 20, 23, 26, 29) in 
particular having a higher frictional resistance and/or 

a lower hardness than the material of the main body (11).
