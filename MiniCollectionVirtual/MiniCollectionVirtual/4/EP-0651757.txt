<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of formula (I) in which R1 is hydrogen, a straight-chained, branched, saturated or unsaturated, possibly phenyl-substituted alkyl radical with 1-9 carbon atoms or a phenyl ring, which may be substituted by C1-C3-alkyl, C1-C3-alkoxy or halogen; R2 is hydrogen or C1-C3-alkyl, in which the two radicals may be the same or different, R is hydrogen or a straight-chained or branched alkyl radical with 1-4 carbon atoms, X is an alkylene chain with 1-6 carbon atoms, which may be singly or multiply substituted by C1-C3-alkyl and may be interrupted by oxygen, and 1 or 2 carbon atoms in the alkylene chain may be a component of a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring, and A is hydrogen or possibly amino substituted by alkyl groups with 1-6 carbon atoms, and their pharmacologically acceptable salts, process for producing them and medicaments for the treatment of calcium metabolism disorders.

-alkyl, whereby the two radicals can be the 
same or different, R represents hydrogen or a straight-chained 

or branched alkyl radical with 1 - 4 carbon 
atoms, X signifies an alkylene chain with 1 - 6 carbon 

atoms which can be substituted one or more times by

whereby 1 or 2 carbon atoms of the alkylene chain can 

possibly be part of a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring 
and Y signifies hydrogen, hydroxyl or amino possibly 

substituted by alkyl groups with 1 - 6 carbon atoms, 
as well as their pharmacologically acceptable salts.

 and X have the above-given meaning, 
with a mixture of phosphorous acid or phosphoric acid 

and a phosphorus halide or phosphoryl halide or can 
also bring to reaction the phosphorus halide alone in 

the presence of water and subsequently hydrolyses to 
the free diphosphonic acid or, if desired, converts 

the isolated compounds of the general formula I into 
their esters or into pharmacologi
cally acceptable 
salts.
