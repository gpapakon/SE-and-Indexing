<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid permanent cracks in the case of prestressed-concrete sleepers with post-tensioning which are subjected to high loading, it is proposed to use as stressing reinforcement, in place of the hitherto-used smooth hairpin-shaped stressing bars, those of profiled cold-drawn steel.

<CLAIMS>
Prestressed concrete sleeper with prestressing with later bonding, in which
a steel reinforcement consisting of two hairpin-shaped reinforcing rods laid

crosswise is introduced into prefabricated channels after the hardening of
the concrete and tensioned,
characterised by the fact
 that reinforcing rods made of
profiled cold drawn steel which are provided with trench-like depressions

in their surface through a later rolling operation, are used for the steel
reinforcement.
