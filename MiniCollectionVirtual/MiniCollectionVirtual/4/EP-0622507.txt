<ABSTRACT>
A supporting means for a load-bearing floor constructed in a modular manner from prefabricated elements, and in particular a lightweight-construction parking deck, comprises a vertical support (4), of which the lower end is supported on a supporting foot (5). The supporting foot bears, by means of load-distribution surfaces (13) formed on its underside, without foundation on the underlaying surface (11) and has a hollow (14), on the base (15) of which there bears a load-bearing plate (21). The upwardly curved upper side of the load-bearing plate (21) forms a rest (22) for a supporting plate (24) which terminates the support (4) towards the bottom. In order to design the supporting means such that a restricted degree of lateral compensation is also possible once the supporting means has been positioned on the underlying surface, the invention proposes to design the supporting plate (24) such that it is flat on its underside bearing on the load-bearing plate (21). With one configuration, it is further proposed that the load-bearing plate (21) has horizontal play on all sides with respect to the wall of the hollow (14).

Support for a modular supporting floor constructed 
of prefabricated elements, in particular a 

parking deck of lightweight construction, having a 
vertical pillar (4) whose lower end is supported on a 

supporting foot (5) which rests with load-distributing 
surfaces (13), constructed on its underside, without a 

foundation on the ground (11), and which is provided with 
a recess (14) on whose base (15) a bearing plate (21) for 

the pillar (4) rests, characterized in that the supporting 
foot (5) is provided with a through-bore (16) which 

starts from the base (15) of the recess (14), runs 
axially, and through which a centering body (17) extends, 

which projects into the ground (11). 
Support according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the supporting foot (5) consists of solid material, 

in particular of reinforced concrete. 
Support according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that the supporting foot (5) has in cross-section 

the shape of a short truncated cone with outer 
surfaces (12) curved concavely inwards. 
Support according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the centering body (17) tapers slightly conically 

towards the bottom and bears without lateral clearance 
against the correspondingly conically designed outer 

surface of the through-bore (16). 
Support according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the upper end face (18) of the 

centering body (17) is located below the base (15) of the 
recess (14).  

 
Support according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the centering body (17) is provided 

with a continuous longitudinal bore (19). 
Support according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the recess (14) of the supporting 

foot (5) is filled with a non-shrinking mortar (25). 
Support according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the depth of the recess (14) is 

approximately half the height of the supporting foot (5). 
Support according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the length of the pillar (4) is 

adjustable. 
Support according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the bearing plate (21) has an upper side which is 

formed to be curved towards the top and forms a rest (22) 
for a supporting plate (24) which terminates the pillar 

(4) towards the bottom, and in that the supporting plate 
(24) is designed to be flat on its underside which rests 

on the bearing plate (21). 
Support according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the bearing plate (21) has a horizontal clearance on 

all sides relative to the wall of the recess (14), and it 
has an underside of flat design, which rests so as to be 

horizontally displaceable on the base (15) of the recess 
(14), said base likewise being of flat design.
