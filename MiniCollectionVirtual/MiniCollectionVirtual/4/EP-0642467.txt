<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the direct preparation of alpha -calcium sulfate hemihydrate by converting an organic calcium salt with a sulfate compound in an aqueous system at a temperature exceeding the  alpha -calcium sulfate hemihydrate/calcium sulfate dihydrate transition temperature. In spite of the fact that said transition temperature has not been essentially decreased on account of the presence of the ions different from the calcium and sulfate ions it has been possible to obtain  alpha -calcium sulfate hemihydrate in a high yield at a temperature, which is hardly higher than the hemihydrate/dihydrate transition temperature, for instance less than 1  DEG C. In view of the above it is possible to cary out the reaction below the boiling point of the solution or suspension of the organic calcium salt and the sulfate compound i.e. it is possible to perform the reaction at atmospheric pressure which is considered benificial from a technological point of view. Examples of organic calcium salts are calcium lactate, calcium acetate, calcium gluconate and calcium citrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the direct formation 
of α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate by converting a calcium salt with a 
sulfate compound in an aqueous system at temperatures exceeding the 
α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate/calcium sulfate dihydrate transition 
temperature. The ability of calcium sulfate hemihydrate to readily convert 
to the dihydrate form and harden when mixed with water is the basis 
for its many uses (e.g. in wallboard or in cement to control set). 
Two forms of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, i.e. the α- and β-forms, 
are identified. α-Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is distinguishable 
from β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate in that its particles 
disintegrate very little when mixed with water. Hence it requires 
less mixing water to form a workable slurry and consequently, it has 
the ability to produce denser and higher compressive-strength casts. 
Furthermore, less excess water has to be removed after dehydration 
is complete. β-Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is obtained when natural or 
synthetic gypsum is dehydrated in a vacuum at 100°C, or under 
conditions where a nearly saturated steam atmosphere does not 
prevail. α-Calcium sulfate hemihydrate may be prepared by dehydration 
of gypsum in water at temperatures above 97°C under elevated 
pressure or by conversion in an atmosphere of saturated steam (under 
elevated pressure). Conversion of calcium sulfate dihydrate to α-calcium 
sulfate hemihydrate can also be realized at lower 
temperatures and pressures not exceeding the atmospheric pressure in 
certain salt or acid solutions. These salt or acid solutions are 
characterized in that they either increase the boiling point of the 
solution or decrease the transition temperature considerably (ref.: 
"Crystallization as a separation process", ACS Symposium Series 438, 
1990, E.T. White and S. Mukhopadhyay, p. 300. Fig.5). However, it is 
possible to form α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate directly out of 
solution. This is done by adding sulphuric acid to a solution 
containing a calcium salt as described in DE-C- 2,519,122. More in 
particular DE-C- 2,519,122 relates to a process for the preparation  
 
of α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate by converting a calcium compound 
with a sulfate or bisulfate ions containing compound in an aqueous 
medium at a temperature exceeding the calcium sulfate 
hemihydrate/calcium sulfate dihydrate transition temperature, which 
process is characterized in that the calcium compound is calcium 
chloride. As appears from the description of said DE-C the chloride
