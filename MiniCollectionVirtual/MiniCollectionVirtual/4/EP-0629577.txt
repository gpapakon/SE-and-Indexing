<ABSTRACT>
An improved load-lifting and orienting apparatus (10) in which the 
load orienting part (13) of the apparatus can be removably and pivotally 

coupled to the load-lifting part (11) of the apparatus. The load-lifting 
part (11) includes a boom assembly (70) having a shiftable boom (72). 

The load orienting part (13) includes a beam (12) having a capstan (20) 
around which a single cable (60) is wound. The end portions (60a,60b) of 

the cable (60) extend downwardly from bearing structure at the ends 
(28,30) of the beam (12), whereby the lower ends of the cable can be 

coupled to a load, such as a telephone pole (86) or vehicle engine (92). 
The capstan (20) is rotatable by a hand tool or by a drive motor, 

whereby the capstan (20) can be rotated in one direction to shorten the 
length of one cable portion and to lengthen the other cable portion. 

Rotation of the capstan (20) in the opposite direction lengthens the one 
cable portion and shortens the other cable portion. The shortening and 

lengthening of the cable portions (60a,60b) allow the load to be shifted 
about as desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in the 
lifting of loads of various kinds and, more particularly, 
to apparatus which allows for orienting a load after the 
load has been lifted above the ground. Load-lifting and orienting devices have been 
known and used in the past. Generally, these devices are 
quite complex in construction and operation and are 
expensive to produce and maintain. Disclosures relating 
to this general subject matter are found in U.S. Patents 
2,020,306, 2,412,488 and 3,541,888. Patent 2,020,306 shows a load-lifting apparatus 
having a beam and a pair of sheaves mounted on a 
rotatable shaft for lifting a load from a vehicle. A 
pair of cables are connected to the lower of the load and 
the cables are wound around the sheaves. A motor which 
drives a worm rotates a worm gear coupled to the shaft. 
The patent states that when the motor is not operating, 
the worm will hold the sheaves stationary. Patent 2,412,488 shows a load-lifting apparatus 
including a frame having end blocks so that a screw can 
be rotated by a crank arm to shift a hoist cage along the 
length of the frame to equalize a load. Chains are 
secured to a load, such as a vehicle engine, and a screw 
is rotated so that the cage is approximately in the 
center of the frame. The hoist is lifted until the 
engine is raised a slight distance, and the cage is 
repositioned along the length of the frame so that the  
 
weight of the engine is equalized between the supporting 
chains. Patent 3,541,888 discloses a worm which can be 
used to prevent uncontrolled reverse rotation of a winch 
assembly comprised of a winch drum and a rope. Because of the drawbacks and problems 
associated with prior load-lifting and orienting 
structures of conventional design, a need exists for 
improvements in this type of mechanical equipment and the 
present invention satisfies this need. The present invention provides an improved 
load-lifting and orienting apparatus in which the load 
orienting part of the apparatus can be removably and 
pivotally coupled to the load-lifting part of the 
apparatus. The load-lifting part of the apparatus 
includes a boom assembly having a boom which is raised 
and lowered and which can be connected by a chain and a 
pivotal connector to the load orienting part of the 
apparatus. Thus, the load orienting part can be raised 
and lowered relative to a support surface and the boom 
assembly which has a carriage which allows the boom to 
move from place to place over a surface. The load orienting part of

between the ends thereof; 

bearing structure on the beam near respective ends 
thereof; 

a cable wrapped around the capstan and in frictional 
engagement therewith, said cable extending outwardly 

from the capstan and partially about and downwardly from 
the bearing structure, whereby a load can be coupled 

with the cable at the ends of the cable below the beam; 
and 

actuatable means coupled with the capstan for rotating 
the capstan in opposed directions relative to the beam, 

there being means for releasably holding the capstan 
against rotation when said rotating means is deactuated. 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1, wherein the cable 
is wrapped around the capstan a number of times to form
