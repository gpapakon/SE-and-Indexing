<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for encrypting an decrypting information, for storing the encrypted information, and for decrypting the information stored in an encrypted manner, a processor being used for processing data, unencrypted information being fed to the processor by means of an input unit connected to the processor, the encrypted information being stored in a mass memory (bulk memory) and the information being encrypted and decrypted by a cryptographic unit, the cryptographic unit (2) being connected between the processor (1) and the mass memory (3).

Method of enciphering and deciphering information, for
storing the enciphered information, for deciphering the

information stored in enciphered form, wherein

a processor is used for processing data,
unenciphered information is supplied to the processor by
means of an input unit connected to the processor,
the enciphered information is stored in a memory,
the information is enciphered and deciphered by a
cryptographic unit, wherein
the cryptographic unit is connected between the processor
and the memory

characterised in that a signal is transmitted from the
cryptographic unit (2) to the processor (1) as soon as the

information has been completely enciphered or deciphered again
by the cryptographic unit (2), the processor (1) sending new

data to the cryptographic unit (2) only after receiving this
signal.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that,
depending on a signal present at the cryptographic unit (2),

either the information coming from the processor (1) is
enciphered and transmitted to the mass memory (3) in

enciphered form by the cryptographic unit (2) or the
information filed in the mass memory (3) is deciphered by the

cryptographic unit (2) and transmitted to the processor (1) in
deciphered form. 
Device for enciphering and deciphering information, for
storing the enciphered information, for deciphering the

information stored in enciphered form with

a processor for processing information,
an input unit which is connected to the processor and by
means of which the unenciphered information can be input,
an output unit which is connected to the processor and on
which the information can be displayed in unenciphered

form,
a cryptographic unit with which the information can be
enciphered and deciphered again,
a memory in which the enciphered information can be
stored and from which the information can be read out

again, wherein
the cryptographic unit is arranged between the processor
and the memory,

characterised in that the cryptographic unit (2) comprises an
output (9) by means of which a signal can be transmitted to

the processor on completion of enciphering or deciphering.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
cryptographic unit (2) comprises bidirectional contacts (6, 7)

and a read/write input (8), and the bidirectional contacts (6,
7) act as input or as output as a function of a signal present

at the read/write input (8).
