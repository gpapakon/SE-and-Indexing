<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for selectively modifying the refractive index of 
an optically transmissive body (20) having an optical propagation axis. 

According to this 
method, polarized, actinic radiation (40) is impinged on at least a 

portion of the body. In 
contrast to methods of the prior art, the actinic radiation is at least 

60% polarized 
with a polarization direction parallel (p) to a plane containing the 

propagation axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to methods for using actinic radiation to modify 
the optical properties of optical materials by producing refractive index perturbations 
having desired characteristics. The invention pertains, in particular, to the 
application of such methods for manufacturing Bragg gratings in optical 
waveguiding articles such as optical fibers. Certain optical media, including at least some silica-based optical fibers, 
can be modified by exposure to electromagnetic radiation in an appropriate spectral 
range. (Ultraviolet radiation is typically used.) That is, exposure of a photosensitive 
optical fiber (or other optical medium) to appropriate radiation may cause the 
refractive index to change in the exposed portion of the medium. A periodic pattern 
can be imposed on the impinging radiation by, e.g., superimposing a pair of beams 
of substantially monochromatic radiation to create an interference pattern. When 
such a patterned radiation field impinges on an optical fiber or other optical 
waveguide having a core of the appropriate photosensitivity, a corresponding pattern 
is imposed on,the core in the form of periodic (or quasiperiodic) fluctuations in the 
core refractive index. Such a pattern, which is referred herein to as a "Bragg 
grating," can behave as a spectrally selective reflector for electromagnetic radiation. A technique for creating these Bragg gratings is described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,725,110, issued to W. H. Glenn, et al. on Feb. 16, 1988, and U.S. Patent No. 
4,807,950, issued to W. H. Glenn, et al. on Feb. 28, 1989. An optical fiber laser 
having a DBR-terminated cavity is described in G. A. Ball and W. W. Morey, 
"Continuously tunable single-mode erbium fiber laser," OpticsLett.17 (1992) 420 - 
422. Bragg gratings are useful, inter alia, as spectral filters. An optical filter 
which comprises a Bragg grating formed in an optical fiber is described in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,007,705, issued to W. W. Morey, et al. on April 16, 1991. Practitioners in the art have reported that Bragg gratings formed in this 
manner are anisotropic. That is, an optical signal of a given vacuum wavelength has 
an effective wavelength within the Bragg grating that is polarization-dependent. As  
 
a consequence, the wavelength of maximum reflectivity of the Bragg grating tends to 
shift as the polarization of a linearly polarized input signal is rotated. The anisotropy 
of Bragg gratings in optical fibers has been reported, for example, by G. Meltz and 
W. W. Morey, "Bragg Grating Formation
