<ABSTRACT>
For tying a compressed bale (10,50) tending to expand 
primarily along a major axis, a bale tie (30,60) made preferably 

from steel wire or alternatively from steel strap is 
bent to form two marcelled portions (40,70), which are 

characterized by sinusoidal undulations, which are 
oriented so as to be generally parallel to the major 

axis, and along which the tie can straighten to absorb 
tensile forces. A joint (34,64) is formed at the opposite ends 

of the tie. Where bent to form the marcelled portions (40,70), 
the tie has an ultimate strength less than the ultimate 

strength of an undeformed portion of the tie but more 
than the ultimate strength of the joint. An apparatus 

for forming a wire with a marcelled portion comprises 
upper rolls (130) and lower rolls (140), which are mounted rotatably 

and respectively on an upper block (108) and a lower block (110). 
The upper block is mounted pivotally to the lower 

block.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a bale tie for tying a compressed bale, 
such as a cotton bale, which tends to expand along a major axis. The invention especially pertains to a tie for tying a compressed 
bale conforming generally to a rectangular solid, defining mutually 
orthogonal axes including a compression axis, and tending to expand 
primarily along said compression axis after being compressed and 
tied, with a tie element, with two opposite ends of the tie element 
which are joinable to each other, and with at least one marcelled 
means between substantially straight portions of the tie element 
comprising a series of sinusoidal undulations. The invention pertains 
also to a package according to the preamble of claim 6. The invention 
pertains further to an apparatus for forming a wire according to the 
preamble of claim 10. U.S. Patent No. 2,356,936 relates to bale ties according to the 
preamble of claim 1. This tie comprises a portion of sinusoidal 
undulations, which are slightly straightened only in the event of 
excessive tension, such as would occur if the bale were dropped. This 
portion has the disadvantage, to be so proportioned as not to be 
affected by the normal tension in the tie, in other words the bale 
tie is not able to absorb tensile forces imparted to the bale tie by 
such a bale having the bale tie wrapped therearound.  
 Specifications for cotton bale packaging materials are approved from 
time to time by the Joint Cotton Industry Bale Packaging Committee 
(JCIBPC). According to the 1992 JCIBPC specifications, approved 
materials for bale ties inculde cold rolled, high tensile steel 
strapping, which may employ a fixed-seal connection, a 
controlled-slip connection, or a keylock type connection, and steel 
wire conforming to ASTM A 510-82 and employing an interlocking 
connection or a twistlock connection. Steel strapping ties with controlled-slip connections are exemplified 
in Huson U.S. Patent No. 4,466,535 and in Urban et al. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,501,356. Steel strapping ties with keylock type connections are 
exemplified in Lems et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,156,385, Duenser U.S. 
Patent No. 4,226,007, and Lems et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,228,565. 
Steel wire ties with interlocking connections are exemplified in 
Bailey U.S. Patent No. 3,949,450 and in Simich U.S. Patent No. 
4,070,733. Typically, a cotton bale is compressed along a  
 
major axis and tends to expand primarily along the major axis, which 
is vertical in a context of the aforenoted specifications. Such a 
bale may

A tie for tying a compressed bale (10) conforming generally to a 
rectangular solid, defining mutually orthogonal axes including a 

compression axis, and tending to expand primarily along said 
compression axis after being compressed and tied,

straight portions (42) of the tie element (30) comprising a series of 

sinusoidal undulations (44), 
 
characterized by
 
two marcelled means (40), which are located with distance to the 

joinable ends such that in use they extend, related to the 
rectangular solid, upon opposite sides of it in a direction parallel 

to the compression axis,
 
with the sinusoidal undulations of each marcelled means (40) 

straightening out under the tensile forces imparted to the tie 
element (30), whereby the marcelled means (40) absorb tensile forces 

and prevent maximum tensile forces from being applied to the opposite 
ends forming the joint (34) for the tie element (30).  

 
The tie of claim 1 wherein said two marcelled means (40) together 
utilize less than one half of the overall length of the tie.

so as to have the marcelled means (40) and to form a joining 

formation (32) at each of the opposite ends, the joining formations 
(32) being engageable with each other so as to form the joint. 
The tie of claim 3, wherein the joint has an ultimate strength 
equal approximately to 65% of the ultimate strength of an undeformed 

portion of the wire and wherein the ultimate strength of the wire 
where bent to form the two marcelled means (40) is approximately 85% 

to approximately 90% of the ultimate strength of an undeformed 
portion of the wire.

compression axis, whereby the sinusoidal undulations (44) of each 

marcelled means (40) are straighted out under the tensile forces 
imparted to the tie element (30) by the bale (10) tending to expand, 

and whereby the marcelled means (40) absorb tensile forces and

forming the joint for the tie element (30).
