<ABSTRACT>
A child seat module (16) integrated with a rear vehicle seat (10), and including fold-down lower (19) and upper (20) segments, interconnected by a flexible and detachable hinge (21) and plastic back panel (26) mounted against the back frame of the bench seat. A plastic seat pad support platform (40) is mounted on the inner surface of the lower segment. A pad (90) having seat and back segments is removably mounted on the platform and against the back panel. A safety belt system (22) is operably included in the module. The interconnected lower and upper segments are adapted to being folded down to form, with the platform (40) and pad (90) a child seat cushion and leg support. Alternatively, the leg support (20) may be removed for a child whose size is such that use of the leg support would be uncomfortable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle seats and
more particularly to vehicle seats integrated so as to
provide an adult seat in an adult seat mode and a
child's seat in a child seat mode.The type of integrated vehicle seat herein
contemplated is the type disclosed in the PCT
International Publication WO 92/20549, published May
14, 1992, entitled "Integrated Child Seat for
Vehicle". The vehicle seat disclosed in the PCT
application is a three-mode seat for a motor vehicle
cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide
three modes of operation including an adult seat mode,
a large child booster seat mode, and a small child
mode.As was indicated in the specification of the
PCT application, by providing for both a small child
mode and a large child booster seat mode, the
integrated seat was able to conveniently accommodate
a fairly wide range of children's sizes, thus
rendering the integrated seat more useful for a
greater number of years and hence more useful to a
greater number of family situations. An important
feature of the subject matter of the PCT application
is the provision of the large child booster seat mode.
In this mode, the child seat module is deployed to
accommodate the child and the adult seat belt assembly
is used to provide restraint; whereas in the small
child mode, restraint is provided by the child's seat
belt assembly included as part of the child's seat
module.The exemplary embodiment of the three-mode
seat, disclosed in publication WO 92/20549, is with 
respect to the bench seat of a van-type motor vehicle.
In sedan-type motor vehicles, it may be desirable to
integrate the back seat so as to provide the child
seat mode alternative to the usual adult seat mode.
Moreover, it may be desirable to integrate the back
seat so that only one child is accommodated in the
center of the rear seat. Under these circumstances,
it may be difficult to provide sufficient restraint in
a third large child booster seat mode simply by
utilizing lap belt components. The requirement for
restraint is included in United States Motor Vehicle
safety Standard No. 213-80. Consequently, it becomes
necessary to provide for simple convenient
adjustability to child's seat belt assembly embodied
in the child seat module to accommodate a full range
of sizes.While the patent literature contains
proposals for integrated seats which provide child's
seat belt adjustments for accommodating both a large
child and a small child, to date there has been no
widespread usage of such adjustable integrated
arrangements.One
