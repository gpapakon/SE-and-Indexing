<ABSTRACT>
A coil former having a top part and at least one bottom part (13) tapering downwards in the form of a truncated cone is proposed, which coil former is produced from a thermosetting plastic using the injection moulding process and is distinguished by the fact that a thin injected-on lug (12) is provided over the complete height (H) of the bottom part (13). In addition, a mould for shaping the coil former is specified, which mould has at least one blind cavity in the bottom part of the mould, which blind cavity is connected to the mould cavity by a gap running over the complete height of the mould cavity provided for the injection moulding.

<CLAIMS>
Coil former with an upper part (14) and at least one
lower part (13) tapering downwards in the form of a

truncated cone, said coil former being produced in an
injection-moulding process and the transition from the

upper part (14) to the lower part (13) being defined by
the injection-moulding seam (15) that is caused by the

separation plane of the injection-moulding die,

characterised in that
 the lower part (13) exhibits an
integrally moulded thin vane (12) over its full height

(H).
Coil former according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the vane (12) is capable of being broken off from the
lower part (13).
Coil former according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the vane (12) connects the lower part (13) to an
extension extending parallel thereto and corresponding

approximately to the dimensions of the lower part (13).
Coil former according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

several lower parts (13) are provided.
Coil former according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that

four identically formed lower parts (13) are provided
which are arranged symmetrically in relation to the

upper part.
Coil former according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 by way of material use is made of
a thermosetting plastic.
Coil former according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that

the material is an unsaturated polyester compound. 
Coil former according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the thickness of the vane (12) corresponds maximally to
one third of the diameter of the lower part (13).
Injection-moulding die with an upper die part (1) and a
lower die part (2) in which the mould hollow (3,4) for

an injection-moulded article, in particular a coil
former, and at least one blind cavity (7) are formed and

between which in the closed state a separation plane (5)
is formed, 
characterised in that
 the at least one blind
cavity (7) is provided in the lower die part (2) and is

connected to the mould hollow (3) by means of a gap (6)
extending over the full height (H) of the mould hollow

(3).
Injection-moulding die according to Claim 9,

characterised in that
 the blind cavity (7) opens at its
upper end (7') into a ventilating channel (8) extending

horizontally.
Injection-moulding die according to Claim 9 or 10,

characterised in that
 the volume of the blind cavity (7)
is at least as large as the volume of the mould hollow

(3) connected to it.
Injection-moulding die according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 in each instance a blind
cavity (7) is assigned to a plurality of regularly

arranged mould hollows (3).
Injection-moulding die according to Claim 9,

characterised in that
 the gap (6) is narrow in relation
to the diameter of the mould hollow (3) and serves to

form a thin vane (12) on the injection-moulded article
(10). 
Coil former with an upper part (14) and at least one
lower part (13) tapering downwards in the form of a

truncated cone, said coil former being produced in an
injection-moulding process and the transition from the

upper part (14) to the lower part (13) being defined by
the injection-moulding seam (15) that is caused by the

separation plane of the injection-moulding die,

characterised in that
 the lower part (13) exhibits a
breaking edge over its full height (H).
Process for the production of an injection-moulded part,
in particular of a coil former having an upper part and

a lower part, wherein synthetic material is injected in
plastic form under high pressure into an injection-moulding

die comprising at least one mould hollow that
is sealed by the flow front that forms, said mould

hollow being located substantially in the mould-release
direction, 
characterised in that
 over the height of the
mould hollow parallel to the mould-release direction a

thin vane is integrally moulded, the volume of which is
connected to a compensating volume.
Process according to Claim 15, 
characterised in that
 the
compensating volume is a blind cavity.
Process according to Claim 16, 
characterised in that
 the
flow front presses the air which is present in the die

into a ventilating channel that is connected to the
compensating volume.
