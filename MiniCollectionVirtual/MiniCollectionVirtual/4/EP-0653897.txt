<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is disclosed for producing one 
or more audiospatial effects in an original audio signal. 

A spatially disorienting signal, typically a modified 
white noise pattern, is combined with the original audio 

signal. A spatially reorienting signal is further 
combined with the original audio signal in order to give 

a listener the perception, upon hearing the original 
audio signal played back, that the sound emanates from a 

predetermined direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
audio reproduction. More specifically, the invention 
relates to techniques for producing or recreating three-dimensional, 
binaural-like, audiospatial effects. Binaural (literally meaning "two-eared") sound 
effects were first discovered in 1881, almost immediately 
after the introduction of telephone systems. Primitive 
telephone equipment was used to listen to plays and 
operas at locations distant from the actual performance. 
The quality of sound reproduction at that time was not 
very good, so any trick of microphone placement or 
headphone arrangement that even slightly improved the 
quality or realism of the sound was greatly appreciated, 
and much research was undertaken to determine how best to 
do this. It was soon discovered that using two telephone 
microphones, each connected to a separate earphone, 
produced substantially higher quality sound reproduction 
than earphones connected to a single microphone, and that 
placing the two microphones several inches apart improved 
the effect even more. It was eventually recognized that 
placing the two microphones at the approximate location 
of a live listener's ears worked even better. Use of 
such binaural systems gave a very realistic spatial 
effect to the electronically reproduced sound that was 
impossible to create using a single microphone system. 
Thus, quite early in this century, it was recognized that 
binaural sound systems could produce a more realistic 
sense of space than could monaural systems.  However, building a commercially viable audio system 
that embodies the principles of binaural sound and that 
actually works well has proven immensely difficult to do. 
Thus, although the basic method of using in-the-ear 
microphones has been known for many decades, the method 
remains commercially impractical. For one thing, even if 
a recording made by placing small microphones inside one 
person's ear yields the desired spatial effects when 
played back on headphones to that same person, the 
recording does not necessarily yield the same effects 
when played back for other people, or when played over a 
loudspeaker system. Moreover, when recording with in-the-ear 
microphones, the slightest movement by the 
subject can disturb the recording process. Swallowing, 
breathing, stomach growls, and body movements of any kind 
will show up with surprising and distracting high volume 
in the final recording; because these sounds are 
conducted through the bone structure of the body and 
passed
