<DESCRIPTION>
Formulation of a coating which is suitable for
exterior use such as on the surfaces of an automobile is
complex. The reason is that the coating must remain
essentially unchanged in appearance over a period of
several years while being exposed to a variety of weather
conditions. The two major components of the coating are
the vehicle and the pigment, and individually both can
vary widely in stability properties.Titanium dioxide is a most important pigment in
such coatings and there is large quantity of literature
on the methods and techniques to increase the stability
properties of pigmentary titanium dioxide. Metal oxide-coated
mica nacreous pigments such as titanium dioxide-coated
mica, on the other hand, present a much more
complicated entity than pigmentary titanium dioxide with
respect to stability properties per se and to the coating
exposed to the weather. Methods and techniques which are
used to stabilize pigmentary titanium dioxide are either
ineffective or insufficient to provide stability for
titanium dioxide coated mica platelets.The industry standard weatherstability testing
is to subject coated metal panels to outdoor Florida
weather for at least 2 or 3 years. The conditions
prevalent there are most severe since the daily cycle
includes the night with lower temperature and high
humidity, possibly with some water condensation on the
panels, a change to intense sunlight in the morning along 
with substantial temperature increases, the possibility
of liquid water on the panel from rain in the afternoon
followed by sunlight again and decreasing humidity, and
finally the night again with falling temperatures and
increasing humidity. This type of testing is especially
common in connection with coatings intended for
automotive use.Since it takes such a long time to obtain
meaningful outdoor exposure results, a number of
accelerated weathering tests have been developed which
can be completed in a much shorter period of time. These
tests are used to screen potential candidates and
determine whether the long term outdoor exposure testing
should be conducted.Three types of accelerated tests have evolved
over the years. The first is a low temperature water
immersion test (LTWI) where a pigment is incorporated in
a paint system and then applied to a primed steel panel.
The panel is then partially immersed in 35-50Â°C water for
a week to ten days. After drying, changes in the
immersed section of the panel relative to that part of
the panel which was not immersed in the water are noted.The second type of
