<ABSTRACT>
A mesuring device (8) has a radiation emitter (9) and a linear arrangement (10) of detector elements (11 to 14). The radiation emitter (9) emits a narrow radiation bunch (15) which penetrates a narrow area (20) of the plate-like workpiece (7) at an angle (19). The measuring paths (21 to 24) in the workpiece (7) of the individual beams (1 to 4) in the radiation bunch (15) are of different length and their intensity is thus attenuated to differing degrees. Apparent densities in the narrow area (20) are thus calculated by finding the difference in the final intensities of the beams (1 to 4) thus obtained and finally an apparent density profile over the thickness (6) of the workpiece (7) is drawn up.
