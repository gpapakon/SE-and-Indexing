<ABSTRACT>
A procedure and an apparatus for improving a plating apparatus used for diamond plating, in which plating process a first arc is started between a first electrode (1') and a firing element (5') placed in connection with it, another arc is started by means of the first one between the first electrode (1') and a second electrode (3) and a plasma spray formed from material released from the first electrode (1') is directed towards the material to be plated. That surface (10') of the first electrode from which material is released is abraded continuously during the plating process by an arrangement whereby the emitting surface and at least one grinding element (11', 5') placed in contact with it are brought into motion relative to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure and an apparatus 
for improving a plating apparatus used for diamond plating, as 
defined in the introductory part of respectively claims 1 and 3. Diamond and diamondlike films have properties resembling those 
of corresponding traditional diamonds. The first property is 
hardness. Another significant mechanical property is a low 
friction coefficient. The resistance to wear is also excellent. 
Moreover, such a plating remains unchanged in all known 
bases and acids. Thus, diamondlike platings and films are especially 
applicable for the coating of bodies subject to wear 
and corrosion, such as non-lubricated bearings. Another notable 
feature is the high refraction coefficient of diamonds. WO publication 89/06708 presents an apparatus for diamond 
plating. The apparatus described in said publication works by 
forming from carbon by means of a plasma accelerator a plasma 
spray which is accelerated and deflected towards the body 
under plating. The plasma accelerator has a cylindrical 
graphite cathode. The conducting rod serving as a firing 
device is placed inside the cathode. During plating, carbon in the form of charged ions and uncharged 
atoms is released from the cathode. That surface of 
the cathode which releases carbon is subject to wear, which 
may manifest itself e.g. in the form of microscopic holes 
appearing in the cathode surface, producing spongy structures. 
At first, the arc is normally started from the cathode surface, 
but with the progress of wear the starting of the arc 
occurs more and more frequently at the bottom of the holes. 
Gradually the holes are covered up and the cathode becomes 
incapable of emitting a plasma pulse. For this reason, the cathode surface has to be smoothed out. 
This is generally effected by removing the cathode and 
refacing it e.g. by turning. This is a complicated procedure.  
 Moreover, it is impossible to keep the plating apparatus 
running continuously for a long time. Typically, the cathode 
has to be refaced at a few hours' intervals. The object of the present invention is to achieve an improvement 
to diamond plating equipment using known techniques. The 
procedure of the invention for improving a plating apparatus 
is characterized in that the plasma surface of the cathode is 
continuously ground by means of a grinding blade or equivalent. 
Preferred embodiments 
of the invention are disclosed in dependent claims 2 and 4 to 7. Using the procedure of the invention, it is possible to 
achieve a decisive
