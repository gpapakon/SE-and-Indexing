<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ester 
compound, an active agent for controlling noxious insect 
pests containing the ester compound as an active 
ingredient, an intermediate for production of the ester 
compound, and a process for producing the intermediate. Certain ester compounds have been disclosed as 
an active ingredient of pesticides, for example, in 
JAPANESE PATENT KOKAIs (Laid Open) No.S-56-75459 and 
No.S-57-67537. However, these ester compounds are not 
satisfactory for controlling noxious insect pests.  
 JP-A-56-156 238 discloses a carboxylic acid ester 
represented by the formula [A] 
 
wherein R1 is methyl or hydrogen; R2 is allyl, propargyl, 
benzyl, or p-halogenobenzyl; Y is hydrogen or methyl; X is 
isobutenyl or dihalovinyl when Y is hydrogen, and X is 
methyl or methoxyl when Y is methyl group, 
useful as insecticidal and acaricidal agents. As a result of extensive study, the inventors 
have found that an ester compound represented by a 
formula I (shown below) having a unique alcohol moiety 
of the formula II is much more effective for controlling 
noxious insect pests. They also found useful processes 
which can provide said ester compound and said alcohol 
compound in good yields. Thus the present invention provides an ester 
compound (hereinafter referred to as 'the present 
compound') represented by a formula I:  
 
 
wherein R1 denotes a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; 
R2 represents 
a 3,3-dihalogeno-1-methyl-2-propenyl 
group, or a C1-C6 alkyl group which may be substituted 
with at least one halogen atom; 
R3 represents an acid residue of pyrethroids. It also provides an pesticidal agent containing 
the same as an active ingredient for controlling 
noxious insect pests. The present invention further provides an 
intermediate alcohol compound represented by the formula 
II: 
 
wherein R1 and R2 are the same as defined above, a 
process for producing the ester compound I and a process 
for producing the alcohol compound II.  
 The ester compound of the present invention 
shows good effect for controlling noxious insects, 
acarines or mites and nematodes. First, description will be made on the ester 
compound represented by the formula I: 
 
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are the same as defined above. Preferably 3,3-dihalogeno-1-methyl-2-propenyl 
group for R2 is a 3,3-difluoro-1-methyl-2-propenyl group 
or a 3,3-dichloro-1-methyl-2-propenyl group. Preferable C1-C6 alkyl groups which may be 
substituted with at least one halogen atom for R2 
include a 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl group,
