<ABSTRACT>
In a method of minimizing disturbances caused by depositions on a feeding apparatus for a combustion or gasification plant, secondary air is fed via perforated tubes (13) which by affecting the emission levels of the process with longer or shorter time intervals are inserted and withdrawn from the chamber, respectively, while being cleaned from slag, dust and other deposits outside the chamber. The combustion process may continue by using the remaining tubes (13) while one or more thereof are cleaned. A feeding apparatus implementing said method is also described and claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method of the kind stated in 
the preamble of Claim 1. The invention also concerns a feeding apparatus for implementing 
the method. With different types of actual combustion and gasification 
processes there exists an increasing demand for quality and 
quantity gas analysis. Nitrogen oxides are at present the most 
exposed flue gas components, especially when considering 
tariff which has been introduced in Sweden for plants larger 
than 10 MW and with an annual energy production greater than 
50 GWh. These effect and energy limits, respectively, will most 
probably be reduced while at the same time greater demands 
will be made on the measurement of other types of flue gas 
components, i.e. CO and N2O (laughing-gas). The large majority of existing combustion systems are so 
designed that a minimum quantity of all unwanted flue gas 
components is very difficult to attain simultaneously. In 
other words "compromise agreements" e.g. high CO-concentrations 
- low NO-concentrations are unavoidable in these 
systems. The fuel composition often varies from one operation condition 
to another, particularly with regard to different types of 
waste fuels and also wood fuels.  
 Examples of ash and/or slag enriched fuels comprise wood 
fuels, straw, waste such as industrial, municipal, hazardous 
and hospital waste and also hard coal, lignite, peat, lime 
sludge and black liquor. Also crematories and cement kilns are 
included in this category of combustion/gasification systems. "Ash" is a term which designates an inorganic and unburnable 
substance which is originally within the fuel. "Slag" is a term which designates "additives" of inorganic and 
unburnable substances, such as metals, ceramics, glass, stone 
etcetera. "Ash" is often considered contained within the term 
"slag". Fuel price is another important parameter for optimization of 
flue gas or gas parameters. Sulphur content and to a certain 
degree also nitrogen content in the fuel are directly proportional 
to the emission level ahead of a flue gas cleaning 
system. This of cource has the consequence that the fuel price 
becomes higher when i.e. the nitrogen content in the fuel is 
higher. Of course also the economical result is influenced by 
the market price and this will sometimes change quickly. Trade in emission rights according to so called bubble models 
are systems which are expected to have a break-through on the 
market in the future. The above parameters show a future need of flexible 
combustion/gasificatio

<CLAIMS>
A method of minimizing disturbances caused by depositions 
on a feeding apparatus for a combustion or gasification 

plant when optimizing flue gas or gas parameters, particularly 
for fuels rich in ash or slag, with a combustion or gasification 

chamber containing one or more perforated tubes for the 
flow of a fluid and/or solid particles which are fed to the 

chamber in order to maintain a combustion or a gasification 
process therein, in which the tube or tubes in order to affect 

the emission level of the process with longer or shorter 
periods of time are being inserted and withdrawn, respectively, 

from the chamber in order to clean the outside from 
slag and other dust deposition and the flow of fluid via the 

tubes is being controlled, 
characterized
 by 
cleaning the tube or tubes in combination with a withdrawal or 

a subsequent inserting movement in an axial direction. 
A method according to Claim 1, in which the chamber 
contains several similar tubes, possibly at different levels, 


characterized
 by withdrawing one or more tubes 
simulaneously, one or more remaining tubes then compensating 

fluid decrease due to the withdrawn tube or tubes, so as to 
continuously maintain the combustion or gasification process. 
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized
 
by using signals from various transmitters, such as 

for temperature, pressure, flow, existing flue gas components, 
etcetera to determine initiation of the cleaning operation. 
A method according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
by said output signals also for adjusting the feed 

of fluid and solid particles, respectively, to the tubes, said 
feed optionally being carried out in thrusts or intermittently 

at different angles.  
 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
by adding a cooling fluid to reduce the temperature 

of the jacket of the tube to make slag and other dust deposition 
of such a kind that the cleaning operation is facilitated. 
A method according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 
by quickly cooling the tube or tubes before or 

during the cleaning operation thereby using water, liquid 
nitrogen or a similar substance to create a shrinking of the 

tube or tubes, making heavy depositions on it to crack and 
loosen. 
A feeding apparatus for a combustion or a gasification 
plant for minimizing disturbances caused by depositions 

and optimization of flue gas or gas parameters, particularly 
for ash or slag rich fuels, with a combustion or gasification 

chamber (4) carrying one or more perforated tubes (13) for 
flowing a fluid and/or solid particles which are fed to the

the emission level of the process and for cleaning from soot 

and other depositions are insertable in and withdrawable from 
the chamber, respectively,

connection with the withdrawal movement and/or a subsequent 
returning movement in axial direction. 
A feeding apparatus according to Claim 7, comprising 
a means for regulating the flow of fluid to the chamber (4),

17) is adapted to axially withdraw and insert, respectively, 

the tube out of and into the chamber (4), said driving device 
possibly comprising oppositely positioned driving rollers

mantles, said rollers for instance via a belt (16) being 

driven by a motor (17). 
A feeding apparatus according to any of Claims 7-9, 

characterized
