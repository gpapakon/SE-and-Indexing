<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the coating of paper with a coating system which comprises a plurality of components, the single application of material leading to a multilayer structure of the coating material applied. The coating system is preferably aqueous and free from organic halogen compounds, and leads to an improved barrier effect of the paper substrate with respect to water vapour and flavourings.

<CLAIMS>
An aqueous and organohalogen-free, multi-component
coating composition for paper, applied as a single

coating, which leads to the formation of a multilayer
structure, characterised in that the difference in the

surface tensions (in accordance with DIN 53914)
between the optionally pretreated paper, cardboard,

paperboard and paper surface to be coated which
constitute paper composite materials and the coating

in the form in which it is applied is at least 10 mN/m
and preferably at least 20 mN/m, the coating

composition containing a wax component and a
copolymeric binder, the binder being composed of at

least two of the following monomers: acrylates,
methacrylates, vinyl acetate, vinyl alcohol, ethylene,

propylene, butadiene, styrene, acrylic acid,
methacrylic acid, acrylamide and acrylonitrile, and

the difference in the surface tensions of the two
components in the form in which they are applied being

at least 5 mN/m and preferably at least 10 mN/m.
A coating composition according to claim 1,
characterised in that the wax melts between 50째C and

120째C and preferably between 60째C and 90째C.
A coating composition according to claim 2,
characterised in that the wax is a paraffin wax.
A coating composition according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that the proportion of wax is 3 to

50% and preferably 5 to 20% (based on the copolymer).
A paper material having a coating of a composition
according to one of claims 1 to 4.
The use of paper material according to claim 5 for the
production of packagings impermeable to water vapour

and aromas. 
The use according to claim 6 for greasy and moist
products.
