<ABSTRACT>
The compound contains nutritive products and various additives and is produced using an external energy source. 
The nutritive products are cooking salt, sugar and honey in various proportions. Sea salt is sometimes used instead of 

cooking salt. The quantities in gramme per litre are as follows: cooking or sea salt 1-400, sugar 1-3000, honey 1-6000. The 
additives used are chlorides or carbonates of alkaline or alkaline-earth metal, or sea salt, or a mixture of these compounds 

in a quantity of 1-320/gramme/litre. Alternatively, these additives can be trace elements in the form of chlorides or 
carbonates of copper, molybdenum, manganese, iron, cobalt or nickel in a quantity of 1-4/gramme/litre. The process 

involves subjecting the compound to electrical pulses lasting between 1 x 10⁻⁸ and 1 sec., with a potential wave slope at the 
trailing edge of 1 x 10⁻⁸ - 1 x 10¹³ V/sec., a duty cycle of 1 - 10⁴ and an electrical field potential between the electrodes of 

10 - 9 x 10⁴ V/cm. The electrical pulses sometimes undergo initial conversion to magnetic, electromagnetic, light or audio 
pulses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biology and medicine
and more specifically to compositions for effecting the inheritable
structure and for treating the animals and human
being.Said composition may be widely used in the R & D as
well as practical activity including to research the mutagenises
of organisms and in practice for treating different
diseases of animals and human being such as alopecia,
oncological diseases of thyroid gland, gastrointestinal
tract, kidneys and urinary organs, male and femals
sex organs.These compositions are supposed to meet a number of
requirements. Said compositions must not produce any side
effects but shall have a high density of information, be
stored for a long time and preferably under room conditions
as well as shall possess good taste properties.There are known conventional medicinal preparations
obtained under the effect of outside power source (see
US, A, 4,771,130).The conventional preparation comprises three chemically
bonded components:
(1) therapeutically active medicinal component which
exerts influence upon suitable sites of a receptor accessible
to form covalent bonds;(2) therapeutically acceptable component able to be
activated under the effect of an outside power source
(visible, ultraviolet or X-rays) to form a covalent bond
of component(s) of a medicament with specific sites of a
receptor;(3) therapeutically acceptable component for bonding
components 1 and 2.Said conventional preparation is multicomponent, i.e. 
comprising actually three preparations and without influencing
the inheritable structure of an organism.There is a known wound healing agent (see SU
Pat.A 1,553,134) comprising sodium alginate, antiseptic
and calcium salt, consisting of two compositions wherein
a first composition contains ingredients at a ratio thereof
in wt. percent as follows:
sodium salt12 to 14glycerine0.5 to 1.5antiseptic0.1 to 6.0waterbalance
a second composition contains ingredients at a ratio, in
wt. percent as follows:
CaCl21 to 2glycerine0.5 to 1.0waterbalance
Said conventional healing agent does not exert any influence
upon the inheritable structure of an organism.Known in the prior art are methods for effecting
an organism with different factors. Thus, known are a
method intensifying the metabolism and growth of microorganisms
and a device for performing the same (see DE.
Al OS 3,538,194). Said conventional method is characterized
in that microorganisms are subjected to an impact of
electric field whereby the field effect is in the form
of E-pulse and does not exceed
