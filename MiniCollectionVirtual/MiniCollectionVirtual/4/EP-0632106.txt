<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a quinacidone via a 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic acid
dialkyl ester having a high purity as an important
intermediate for the production of a quinacridone pigment,
at high yields without purification.It is known that a 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic
acid dialkyl ester as an intermediate
for the production of a quinacridone pigment is obtained by
polycondensation-reacting 1,4-cyclohexanedione-2,5-di(carboxylic
acid alkyl ester) with an aromatic amino
compound in such amounts that the molar ratio of the 1,4-cyclohexanedione-2,5-di(carboxylic
acid alkyl ester) to
aromatic amino compound is 1/2.The purity of the above intermediate is a critical
factor for producing a quinacridone having a high purity at
high yields and for the subsequent formation of the pigment.
For producing a quinacridone, there is known a method in
which 6,13-dihydroquinacridone is synthesized by allowing
2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic acid dialkyl ester
to undergo a intramolecular-alcohol-elimination, ring-closing
reaction at a high temperature and oxidized to
obtain a quinacridone, or a method in which 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic
acid is synthesized by 
saponifying an ester portion and oxidizing a formed central
ring and further allowed to react with a ring-closing agent
to obtain a quinacridone. In both the above methods, the
purity of the 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic acid
dialkyl ester affects the properties of a quinacridone as an
end product when no purification procedures are carried out
in the course of carrying out the above methods.Therefore, studies have been made to improve the
purity of the above 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic
acid dialkyl ester or the purity of
other intermediates. Japanese Patent Publication No. 37-18733
discloses a method in which succinosuccinic acid
diester is synthesized from succinic acid ester in a
dialkylcarboxylic acid solvent, an arylamino compound such
as aniline and an acid catalyst are added to the reaction
mixture and the mixture is allowed to react in nitrogen
current under atmospheric pressure to obtain a 2,5-di(arylamino)-3,6-dihydroterephthalic
acid dialkyl ester.
This method requires an additional step in which water is
added to the reaction mixture and the resultant mixture is
cooled to precipitate a reaction product, since the reaction
product is present being dissolved in the solvent. In this
method, therefore, a longer period of time is required for
the
