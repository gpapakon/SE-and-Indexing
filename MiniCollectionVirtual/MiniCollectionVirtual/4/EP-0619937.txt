<ABSTRACT>
The machine includes a frame (2) adapted to move along 
spaced ridges (C) planted with crop plants (B), frame support runners 

engaging the furrows (D) between the ridges (C), transverse rows of 
weeding implements carried by the frame (2) for vertical movement 

from an inoperative to an operative position also transversely 
displaceable relative to the frame in opposite directions to 

closely run along the ridges (C) and furrows (D). The actuating rams 
(42,66) are controlled by an operator supported by the frame (2) in a 

position to have a direct view of the weeding implements. 
These weeding implements can be earth working discs (16) for 

mechanically loosening the earth and uprooting the weeds and 
for earth refilling. The distance between the implements can 

be adjusted in accordance with the distance between the 
ridges (C).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to agricultural 
machines and, more particularly, to a machines for working row 
crops such as weeding. In row crop cultivation, it is necessary to remove 
weeds on each side of and as close as possible to the crop 
plants. Known weeding machines use a guidance system, for 
instance runners, running in a ground trace, for instance in 
a furrow, for laterally guiding the earth working implements. 
Such known guidance systems are often not precise enough, for 
instance in the case of carrots cultivation wherein it is 
necessary to weed lateral zones which are very close to the 
planted carrots otherwise the weeds will overwhelm the young 
plants. It is therefore the general object of the present 
invention to provide an agricultural machine for row crop 
cultivation having means for treating the earth at a very 
close distance to the planted crops for effecting, for 
instance, precision weeding and earth refilling. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a machine with precision guidance as above described 
which is particularly adapted for crops planted on equally 
spaced ridges with intervening furrows and in which the 
distance between the ridges may vary. The row crop machine of the invention includes a 
frame which may be self propelled or hitched to a farm tractor 
for movement in a longitudinal direction, earth engaging means 
depending from the frame and preventing movement of the frame 
transversely of said longitudinal direction, at least one 
transverse row of earth working implements carried by the 
frame for movement in said longitudinal direction and also 
transversely displaceable relative to the frame in opposite 
transverse directions and actuator means reacting on the frame 
and acting on the implements to move the row of implements in 
either one of said transverse directions. The actuator means 
are under the control of an operator who has a direct vision  
 
of the ground and, consequently of the crop plants. The 
actuator means could also be under the control of a 
conventional guidance system. Therefore, the working 
implements can be laterally adjusted as the machine moves 
along so as to treat or work the soil very close to the crop 
plants during weeding. The earth engaging means are 
preferably tire wheels carried by the frame and which are used 
for guiding the machine along ground traces such as furrows. Additional actuator means, which serve to raise and 
lower the implements, are also controlled by the operator. Means are
