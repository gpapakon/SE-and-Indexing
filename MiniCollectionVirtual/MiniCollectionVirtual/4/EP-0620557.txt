<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with an arrangement for 
detecting defects in static random access memories, and in 
particular although not exclusively with an arrangement for 
detecting open circuit or "soft" defects in six-transistor memory 
cells. In large memories over half the area of a chip may be taken 
up by the array of memory cells, and in order to allow for the 
occurrence of defects a number of spare circuits or memory cells may 
be provided on the chip so that during testing any failed circuit or 
block of memory cells may be replaced by a spare, for example by 
blowing fuse links, in order to minimise the number of chips 
rejected. With advances in technology it is now possible to integrate 
large amounts of memory into complex systems on single chips, and 
the costs involved in producing such a system depend increasingly on 
the defect levels in the embedded memory, and its area and test 
requirements can be the dominant factors. The use of the 
comprehensive test and redundancy techniques employed for standard 
memory chips makes little sense in embedded applications, since the 
cost of these techniques is justified only by high volume production 
and little variation in product. The wider the range of designs 
using external testing and fuse techniques, to more time and effort 
is required to characterise and implement specific schemes for each  
 
variant. Self testing of memories is now employed in embedded 
systems to reduce test cost. However, one of the major problems is 
testing for retention failure and open circuits, which still require 
tests to be done externally. According to the present invention in a semiconductor 
integrated circuit incorporating a static random access memory 
comprising an array of rows and columns of memory cells an open 
circuit or soft defect detection arrangement comprises, in respect 
of a column of memory cells of the array, means to lower the supply 
voltage to the cells of said column of memory cells, means to apply 
a sequence of test signal levels to the bit lines of said column of 
memory cells, and means to indicate an open circuit defect in one or 
more of the cells of said column from the response to said test 
signal levels. Preferably said means to indicate an open circuit defect in 
one or more cells of said column comprises a latch circuit the 
outputs of which are connectable to said bit lines of said column 
whereby said column exhibiting said defect may be identified. The 
supply voltage to said column of cells may be switched to
