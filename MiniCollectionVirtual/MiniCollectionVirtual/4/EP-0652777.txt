<ABSTRACT>
A method for initiating metastasis of human tumor cells under experimental conditions is provided. Immunocompromised non-human mammals having a viable, xenogeneic organ or tissue are used as a host for human tumor cells. The cells are introduced into the chimeric animal after the solid tissue is implanted and are then able to grow and metastasize as they would in situ. Therapeutic regimens may be evaluated in this system to determine efficacy against metastatic processes.

<SMALL ANIMAL METASTASIS MODELCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 08/027,148 filed March 4, 1993.INTRODUCTION Technical FieldThe field of this invention is immunocompromised mammals comprising xenogeneic tissue, and their use in the analysis of metastasis.10BackgroundOne of the most serious problems that faces a practicing oncologist is the metastasis of malignant tumor cells from the primary site to multiple, distant sites.15 Surgery is often effective against a primary tumor, but cannot excise all malignant tissue if the cancer has etastasized.Existing studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of tumor metastasis have used rodent neoplasms20 as a model system. It has not been possible to experimentally study human neoplasms in vivo for moral and ethical reasons. Attempts have been made to study heterotransplantation systems in which human malignant cells have been transplanted into a subcutaneous site on25 nude mice, but they rarely produce metastatic tumors.However, recent studies have shown the importance of the site of implantations in xenografts. When human tumors are implanted into the correct anatomical site of 

nude mice, (for example, renal carcinoma cells into kidney, or colon cancer cells into spleen or cecu ) , then metastases can be produced. This suggests that interactions between malignant cells and the surrounding organ environment may regulate metastatic activity.It is desirable to have an animal model for human tumors where the malignant cells could grow and move between human organ systems. This would allow anti- metastatic drugs and therapies to be evaluated under controlled and reproducible conditions.Relevant LiteratureThe isolation and metastatic properties of B16 melanoma cells are described in Briles and Kornfield, J. Natl . Cancer Inst . , 60, 1217 (1978). A discussion of invasive variants of this cell line may be found in I. Hart, Am,. J . Pathol . , 97, 587-600 (1979), and G. Poste, et al., Cancer Research , 40, 1636-1644 (1980).The metastatic properties of colorectal carcinomas are discussed in R. Giavazzi, et al., (1986), R.Bresalier, et al., Int . J . Cancer, 39, 625-630 (1986), and the selection of metastatic variants found in K. Morikawa, et al., Cancer Research , 48, 1943-1948 (1988), and K. Morikawa, et al . , Cancer Research , 48, 6863-6871 (1988). X. Fu, et al., P .N .A.S . 88, 9345-9349 (1991), describes models of human metastatic colon cancer in nude mice which are orthotopically
