<ABSTRACT>
The benzofuranyl- and -thiophenyl-alkane-carboxylic acid derivatives 
of the formula (I) 


wherein R₁, R₂, R₃, T, V, and W are as defined in 
Claim 1 are prepared 

by cyclisation of hydroxy acetophenones and related compounds or by 
Wittig-reaction 

of benzofuranyl aldehydes. The compounds can be used to prepare 
medicaments showing antiinflammatory activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to benzofuranyl- and -thiophenyl-alkanecarboxyclic acids
derivatives, processes for their preparation and their use in medicaments.It is known that the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is the physiological source to the
superoxide radical anion and reactive oxygen species derived therefrom which are
important in the defence against pathogens. Uncontrolled formation leads to tissue
damage in inflammatory processes. It is additionally known that elevation of phagocyte
cyclic AMP leads to inhibition of oxygen radical production and that this cell
function is more sensitive than others such as aggregation or enzyme release (cf.
Inb. Arch. Allergy Immunol., vol. 97: pp 194-199, 1992).Benzofuran- and benzothiophene derivatives having lipoxygenase-inhibiting action
are described in the publication EP 146 243.Surprisingly it was found that compounds given by the general formula (I) inhibited
oxygen radical formation and elevated cellular cyclic AMP levels probably by
inhibition of phagocyte phosphodiesterase activity.The invention relates to benzofuranyl- and -thiophenyl-alkanecarboxyclic acids derivatives
of the general formula (I)
