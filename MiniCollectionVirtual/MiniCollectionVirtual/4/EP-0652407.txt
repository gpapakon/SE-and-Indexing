<CLAIMS>
Multi-storey building with a double façade and
ventilating shafts (3) inside the double façade which

are connected to a collector duct (1), characterised
in that the collector duct (1) connects the leeward

side of the building to the windward side of the
building and is provided with outward-opening ports

(5) in order to discharge the air flowing from the
shafts (3) into the collector duct (1) to the

outside, the ports (5) being provided with devices
which prevent air from the outside from entering the

collector duct (1) on the windward side of the
building.
Building according to claim 1, characterised in that
the collector duct (1) is a peripherally extending

annular duct.
Building according to claim 1, characterised in that
the collector duct (1) runs right through the

building and that it forms a collector volume (6).
Building according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the aperture of the port (5)

varies as an "open" function or "close" function in
accordance with the underpressure and overpressure,

respectively.
Building according to claim 1 having window casings
constituted by horizontal bulkheads and vertical

bulkheads which create a window interspace delimited
from the air space in the double façade, which

interspace can be made to communicate with the air
space via at least one overflow opening and is

equipped with an air intake joint which leads to the
outside and is adjustable in size, characterised in 

that the openings at the joints (7) of the window
casings are controlled in a manner whereby a

restriction of the volume flow is achieved upwards of
a certain pressure differential.
Building according to claim 5, characterised in that
additionally provided in the window casing or in the

shafts (3) are openings which can be controlled,
opened and closed via the air temperature in the

window casing.
Building according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in
that when the inner window is shut in winter, the

joint (7) is closed completely or so as to leave only
a minimum aperture, but when the window is open it is

correspondingly fully opened and is controlled in
accordance with Claim 5 and/or Claim 6.
Building according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in
that when the wind is blowing hard, the wind-dependent

control takes precedence and thus even when
the temperature of the window casing is elevated the

temperature-controlled opening is reduced.
Building according to claim 4, characterised in that
the shafts (3) are provided at the overflow openings

of the window casings with nozzle-type devices which
encourage the air to flow from the window casing into

the shaft (3) and make it difficult for the air to
flow back from the shaft into the window casing.
