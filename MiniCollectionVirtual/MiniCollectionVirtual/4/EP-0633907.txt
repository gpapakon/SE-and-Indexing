<ABSTRACT>
The degradation rates of bioerodible polymers used in sustained-release drug delivery formulations are regulated by the incorporation in the polymer of a regulating agent, or erosion rate modifier, which has substantially higher solubility in the polymer than in water. In polymers whose degradation rate is accelerated or decelerated by acids, bases or both, the erosion rate modifier is an acid or base with the appropriate solubility characteristics. Dissolving of an acid or base erosion rate modifier in the polymer as a solid solution permits the use of an acid or base of weaker strength than those used as erosion rate modifiers in the prior art, and achieves a more prolonged regulating effect on the polymer with a lesser potential for undesired injury to the polymer, to the drug, or to the tissues or the organism to which the formulation is applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ADDITIVES FOR BIOERODIBLE POLYMERS TO REGULATE DEGRADATIONThis invention resides in the field of bioerodible polymers for use as drug delivery vehicles. In particular, this invention addresses means for controlling the rate of biodegradation and degradation in general of such polymers.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION One of many known methods of achieving sustained delivery of a drug is by incorporating the drug in a solid polymeric matrix formed from a bioerodible polymer. Formulations of this type are primarily used for parenteral administration. The matrix may assume a variety of forms, but most often is either in the shape of thin rods suitable for injection, or microscopic particles suitable for application as a dry sprinkle or in a suitable liquid vehicle for injection.The term "bioerodible" refers to the quality of the polymer that causes it to be degraded or eroded in vivo. This occurs either through enzymatic action or other types of action, and decomposes the polymer into biocompatible, non-toxic by-products which are further metabolized or excreted from the body through the normal physiological pathways, without raising an immunological reaction.Among the wide variety of polymers having this quality, some which are of particular interest in this invention are poly(orthoester)s and poly(orthocarbonate)s. Such bioerodible polymers are disclosed in Schmitt, U.S. Patent No. 4,070,347, January 24, 1978; Choi, et al. , U.S. Patent No. 4,093,709, June 6, 1978; Schmitt, U.S. Patent No. 4,122,158, October 24, 1978; Choi, et al. , U.S. Patent No. 4,131,648, December 26, 1978; Choi, et al . , U.S. Patent No. 4,138,344, February 6, 1979; Schmitt, U.S. Patent No. 4,155,992, May 22, 1979; Choi, et al . , U.S. Patent No. 4,180,646, December 25, 1979; Capozza, U.S. Patent No. 4,322,323, March 30, 1982; and Schmitt, U.S. Patent No. 4,346,709, August 31, 1982. The disclosures in these patents are incorporated herein by reference. Other bioerodible polymers which are of interest in this invention are poly(lacticacid), poly(glycolic acid) and copolymers of 

lactic acid and glycolic acid. Published literature relevant to these polymers are Schmitt, et al., U.S. patent No. 3,991,766, issued November 16, 1976; Yoles, S., et al., Polymer News 1(4/5):9-15 (1971); Kulkarni, R.K., et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 5:169-181 (1971); and Wise, D.L., Ada Pharm. Suecica 13(suppl.):34 (1976).In these formulations in general, the drug is originally dispersed in and held immobile by the polymeric matrix, and the release of the drug
