<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for forming composite articles which comprises a stretchable or pre-shaped membrane (12) adapted to be placed on a mould and a rigid framework (10) carrying an outer seal (14, 14a), there being an inner seal (18, 18a) attached to the membrane and located between the membrane and the inner side of the rigid framework, the membrane being attached to the seal at the lower-most point thereof. The seal may be affixed to the membrane only, and not to the vacuum manifold. The manifold may comprise a flat bar and the vacuum is then introduced into the cavity (22) by having one or more vacuum valves (26) passing through the bar directly into the cavity. A rigid channel (34) may be placed in the cavity to support the seals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus useful in the production 
of composite products by the vacuum bagging system and in 
particular relates to an improved seal therefor. Vacuum bagging is the term used to describe a method of 
producing pressure and vacuum on various resin filled, carbon, 
glass, synthetic material and metal laminates known as 
composites while curing and consolidation takes place, usually 
by means of heating in a pressurised autoclave or oven or 
hydraulic press. The method may be used in the production of 
various composite parts useful in the aircraft and motor 
industries as well as for the production of things such as 
printed circuit boards for the electronic industry. EP-A-0175510 describes an apparatus of the type described which 
comprises a stretchable membrane or vacuum bag held within a 
rigid framework which is hollow and forms a vacuum manifold 
supplying vacuum to a seal affixed to the membrane and carried 
on the framework by one or more passages communicating with a 
cavity, the resilient seal defined in the cavity within which 
vacuum can be drawn when the framework and membrane are placed 
on a mould base. This system has been found to be very 
effective and the double seal arrangement defining a cavity 
within which vacuum can be drawn is much more secure than 
single seal arrangements since the cavity is considerably 
larger than the cavity adjacent to a single seal and thus a 
greater clamping effect can be obtained than with any single 
seal arrangement giving much more security to the vacuum bag. However, the membrane in the system of the above mentioned 
European patent publication is subject to maximum stress 
adjacent to the inner seal and this is the most common point of 
failure when a vacuum bag apparatus becomes worn. The present 
invention seeks to provide a sealing arrangement improved in 
this respect.  
 W087/05557 discloses an apparatus comprising a stretchable 
membrane with rigid sections attached to a rigid hold down 
frame. The frame carries outer and inner sections defining a 
vacuum cavity and the inner seal is attached to the membrane. 
The preamble of claim 1 is based on this reference. According to the present invention there is provided an 
apparatus for forming composite articles which comprises a 
stretchable or pre-shaped membrane adapted to be placed on a 
mould and a rigid framework carrying an outer seal, there being 
an inner seal attached to the membrane and located between the 
membrane and the inner side of the rigid framework
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for forming composite articles which comprises 
a stretchable or pre-shaped membrane (12) adapted to be placed 

on a mould and a rigid framework (10) carrying an outer seal 
(14a), there being an inner seal (18a) attached to the membrane 

and located between the membrane and the inner side of the 
rigid framework (10) defining a vacuum cavity (22), the 

membrane being attached to the seal on a lower part thereof 
characterised in that the seals are substantially square in 

section and have cut-out sections (36, 40) to enhance 
resilience, and in that the outer seal has an outwardly 

directed downwardly extending curtain portion (38) to form an 
initial loose seal with a mould base. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein a number of 
membranes (12) of different pre-shaped sizes are provided with 

a single manifold thus allowing stacks of composites of 
different sizes and configuration to be moulded without 

requiring a separate seal and manifold assembly for each one. 
An apparatus as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2 wherein 
the framework (10) comprises a flat bar and vacuum is then 

introduced into the cavity by having one or more vacuum valves 
(26) passing through the bar directly into the cavity (22). 
An apparatus as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2 wherein 
a support (34) is positioned between the inner and outer seals 

to prevent them being deformed into the cavity (22) and 
blocking it. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4 wherein the support (34) 
is a metal channel and has holes or other passages therein to 

allow passage of vacuum from the framework to the cavity (22). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5 wherein the channel (34) 
is of lesser height than the seals (14a,18a).
