<ABSTRACT>
A thin-film arrangement for a non-planar structure is 
described. The structure includes a substrate (14) and a 

plurality of thin-film layers stacked on top of each other 
above the substrate. The layers contain conductive patterns 

(27-30) and vias (19-26) that provide connections between the 
conductive pattern in one of the layers to the conductive 

pattern in another layer. Vias that provide a connection 
between the conductive pattern
 of one layer are offset and in 
contact with respect to each other and are positioned in a 

non-linear arrangement, preferably in the form of a helix or 
a multiple helix.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wiring layout, and more 
particularly, to a thin-film wiring arrangement for a non-planar 
structure. Very large scale integrated (VLSI) semiconductor 
circuits are generally manufactured by depositing and 
patterning conductive and non-conductive layers on a 
substrate and by stacking these layers one on top of the 
other. As VLSI circuits become more sophisticated and more 
complex, the number of stacked layers or planes increases, 
thereby creating planarity problems. Much attention has been 
directed to solving this problem. By way of example, J. L. 
Freeman et al, in US-A-5,149,674 provide a method for 
planarizing bonding and probe pads, and more particularly, 
multi-layer metal pads, in relation to the interior of the 
semiconductor VLSI devices. Although planarity has proven to present distinct 
advantages by better controlling critical dimensions and by 
more evenly distributing conductive and dielectric material, 
cost considerations may dictate maintaining a non-planar 
environment. This is particularly true for thin-film 
structures, and it is most evident in areas that surround 
vias. Vias are known in the art to establish electrical 
contact between wiring lines in one layer to wiring lines in 
some other layer, and to provide an external interface for 
interconnections. This contact can be maintained even if the 
lines to be contacted are not in adjacent planes, in which  
 
case contact is usually achieved by stacking vias one on top 
of the other. The process of stacking vias in a non-planar 
environment presents a problem in that vias display a dimple 
on the top surface usually caused by uneven plate-up of the 
metal features. The dimple on the surface of a via causes a 
reduction in the surface area available for contact between 
vias, thus eliminating the use of stacked vias for process 
and reliabilities reasons. Moreover, when vias are stacked 
in a column, the effect of these dimples tends to compound, 
leading to a non-planar structure at the top surface. Adding to the non-planarity problems, the manner in 
which a via column is layed out results in lines having non-uniform 
electrical characteristics due to the presence or 
absence of reference planes beneath or above the transmission 
lines. This unevenness causes a significant decrease in the 
uniformity of lines per channel for long wiring lengths. Due to a non-planar environment, the design of the 
wiring layer and reference layers is critical since 
dielectric non-planarity introduces waviness
