<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically
rewritable non-volatile memory, for example, a
semiconductor non-volatile memory device such as a flash
EEPROM, and to a decoder circuit thereof.In recent years, flash memories have been the
subject of vigorous development. The mainstream of
development has been the hot electron/Fowler Nordheim (FN)
tunnel injection phenomenon wherein channel hot electrons
are injected into a floating gate at the time of writing
and the electrons are discharged from the floating gate to
a source at the time of erasing by the FN tunneling.More specifically, at the time of writing, 12V
is applied to a control gate, 5 to 7V is applied to a
drain, 0V is applied to a source and a substrate, and the
hot electrons generated in the channel are injected into
the floating gate, whereby data is written.At the time of erasing, 0V or a negative voltage
of from -9 to -12V is applied to the control gate, a
positive voltage of 12V or 5V is applied to the source, 0V 
is applied to the substrate, and the drain is kept at the
floating state, to thereby discharge the electrons from
the floating gate to the source by the FN tunneling,
whereby data is erased.However, this hot electron/FN tunnel injection
method has a problem in that it is difficult to lower the
voltage, the channel current required for the writing is
large and therefore the booster circuit becomes big, etc.In a NOR type flash memory, the lowering of
voltage is the biggest topic.In the past, there has been proposed a NOR type
flash memory which solves these problems, has the feature
of enabling NOR type random access, and, further,
incorporates the merits of NAND type performance, i.e., a
high writing speed (refer to, for example, NIKKEI
MICRODEVICES pp. 66-67, October 1992).Figure 1 is a view of the arrangement and
configuration of a so-called NOR type flash memory
proposed in the past.In Fig. 1, MILa denotes a main bit line; SBLa
denotes a sub-bit line; SRLa denotes a source line, STa a
selection transistor serving as a selection gate; SGLa, a
selection gate line, MTa0 to MTa3 denote memory transistors;
and WLa0 to WLa3 denote word lines; respectively.In this memory cell, as shown in Fig. 1, the 
sub-bit lines SBL are branched from the main bit line MILa,
and a plurality of memory transistors (four in this
example) are arranged in parallel at each branched sub-bit
line SBL via the selection transistors ST.Figures 2A and 2B are views of an example of an
actual construction of the flash memory of Fig. 1, in
which Fig. 2A is a
