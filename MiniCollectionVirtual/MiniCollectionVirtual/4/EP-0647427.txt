<ABSTRACT>
This application discloses a portable type breath 
flowmeter apparatus and an asthma management system. 

The apparatus comprises a memory 
for storing a measured expiration data together with date 

and time period. Further, the system comprises a 
breath flowmeter apparatus 1 having a memory 23 and a 

transmitting interface (transmitting means) 21, and an asthma 
data management apparatus 30 having a host computer (analysis 

means) 31 and a printer (output means) 32. Where the patient 
measures an expiration 

the breath flow data are kept stored together 
with the measuring time information. 

The data is sent via the 
transmitting interface 21 to the host computer and 

the analysis graph is outputted from the printer 32.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to breath flowmeter 
apparatuses and asthma management system suitable for 
diagnosis and management of asthma. The peak exipratory flow rate (PEFR) analyzed from 
forced expiratory maneuver tends to gradually decrease before 
arising of an asthma attack. Therefore, if such tendency of 
decreasing is grasped by measuring PEFR everyday, a high dose 
of a predetermined medicine such as bronchodilator is given 
to the patient before the asthma attack to prevent an attack 
of the patient. In such circumstances, recently, a portable and 
mechanical type breath flowmeter apparatus for measuring the 
PEFR at patient's home has been developed. The asthma patient can measure, by using the breath 
flowmeter apparatus, PEFR everyday, for example, in the 
morning, the daytime and the evening, record the measured 
values or a trend graph thereof into a asthmatic diary and 
grasp the condition of the disease objectively. The patient 
takes the medicine in accordance with the medical doctor's 
instruction based on decision of the zone determination such 
as green, yellow, red and the like, that is, a lung function 
assessment information showing an extent of PEFR relative to 
the reference value of the patient previously set by the 
medical doctor, thereby the patient prevents occurring of a 
asthma attack and controls his disease condition. The 
medical doctor investigates the patient's condition and the 
asthmatic diary carried with the patient at every several 
week basis so as to perform an adequate diagnosis and 
treatment. The medicine for preventing the asthma attack, 
for example, bronchodilator may preferably be dosed to the  
 
patent at minimum but appropriate quantity depending on the 
disease condition because such medicine gives an adverse 
reaction to the patient. On the other hand, keeping the asthmatic diary is 
cumbersome and time-consuming, and the youngster and eldery 
patients sometimes mis-records or records forged values 
without measurement. In such case, if the medical doctor 
diagnoses the patients on the basis of the diaries, danger of 
an erroneous diagnosis may arise, this tends to cause death 
of asthma attack or the adverse reaction by the excess dosage 
of the medicine. For this reason, for the asthma management of the 
patients, it is extremely important to record PEFR exactly 
and to diagnose correctly based on the recorded data. The measurement of PEFR is an inspection depending on 
effort of the patient in terms of the expiratory physiology, 
thus,
