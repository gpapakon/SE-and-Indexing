<DESCRIPTION>
The process of blood coagulation, thrombosis, is
triggered by a complex proteolytic cascade leading to the
formation of thrombin. Thrombin proteolytically removes
activation peptides from the Aα and Bβ-chains of fibrinogen,
which is soluble in blood plasma, initiating insoluble fibrin
formation.Anti-coagulation is currently achieved by the
administration of heparins and coumarins. Parenteral
pharmacological control of coagulation and thrombosis is
based on inhibition of thrombin through the use of
heparins. Heparins act indirectly on thrombin by
accelerating the inhibitory effect of endogenous
antithrombin III (the main physiological inhibitor of
thrombin). Because antithrombin III levels vary in plasma
and because surface-bound thrombin seems resistant to this
indirect mechanism, heparins can be an ineffective
treatment. Because certain coagulation assays are believed
to be associated with efficacy and safety, heparin levels
are typically monitored with coagulation assays
(particularly the activated partial thromboplastin time
(APTT) assay). Coumarins impede the generation of thrombin
by blocking the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation in
the synthesis of prothrombin and other proteins of this
type. Because of their mechanism of action, the effect of
coumarins can only develop slowly, 6-24 hours after
administration. Further, they are not selective
anticoagulants. Coumarins also require monitoring with
coagulation assays (particularly the prothrombin time
assay).To better understand the invention, the
following brief description of the coagulation enzyme
system is provided. The coagulation system, sometimes
referred to as the "cascade", is best looked at as a chain
reaction involving the sequential activation of zymogens 
into active serine proteases which eventually lead to the
production of the enzyme, thrombin. Thrombin, through
limited proteolysis, converts plasma fibrinogen into the
insoluble gel, fibrin. Two key events in the coagulation
cascade are the conversion of clotting Factor X to Xa by
clotting factor IXa and the conversion of prothrombin into
thrombin by clotting factor Xa.Both of these reactions occur on cell surfaces,
most notably the platelet endothelial cell surfaces, and
both reactions require cofactors. The major cofactors,
factors V and VIII, circulate as relatively inactive
precursors, but when the first few molecules of thrombin
are formed, thrombin activates, by limited proteolysis, the
cofactors. The activated cofactors, Va and VIIIa,
accelerate, by about three orders of
