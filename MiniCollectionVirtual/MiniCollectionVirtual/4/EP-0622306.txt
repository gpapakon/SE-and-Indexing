<ABSTRACT>
A packaging material is disclosed for producing dimensionally stable, 
liquid-tight packaging containers for liquid foods. 
The packaging material (10) has a core layer (11) of thermoplastic 
and filler admixed into the thermoplastic in a quantity of between 30 and 

70% of the total weight of the packaging material. 
The thermoplastic in the core layer (11) consists of a mixture of a first 
thermoplastic which may be a propylene homopolymer or an 

ethylene/propylene copolymer, and a second thermoplastic which is a 
polyethylene. The quantity of said polyethylene is between 5 and 50% of 

the total thermoplastic quantity of the core layer. 
From a web or a sheet of the packaging material, dimensionally 
stable, liquid-filled packaging containers can be produced by fold forming 

and heat sealing in a conventional manner. Such packaging containers can 
also be produced using other conventional techniques such as blow 

moulding and thermoforming.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging material including a 
core layer of thermoplastic and filler admixed into the thermoplastic, and to 
packaging containers produced from the packaging material. Such 
packaging material and packaging containers, respectively, are known 
from, for example, EP-A-O 353 991, EP-A-O 353 496, EP-A-O 494 594, EP-A-O 
494 595, EP-A-O 499 086, EP-A-O 503 314, and EP-A-O 512 364. The packaging materials described in the above European Patent 
Publications include a core layer of polypropylene containing filler 
distributed in the polypropylene in order to give the packaging material 
increased rigidity. In such instance, the polypropylene consists of a 
propylene homopolymer with a melt index of less than 1 according to ASTM 
(2,16 kg; 230째C), or an ethylene/propylene copolymer with a melt index of 
between 0,5 and 5 according to ASTM (2,16 kg; 230째C). The quantity of 
filler is between 50 and 80% of the total weight of the core layer. From a web or from a prefabricated blank of the packaging material, 
configurationally stable, liquid-tight packaging containers are produced 
employing modern, rational packaging machines of the type which forms, 
fills and seals the packages. From, for example a web, such a configurationally stable, liquid-tight 
packaging container is produced in that the web is reformed into a tube, by 
both longitudinal edges of the web being permanently united to one 
another by so-called heat sealing in a mechanically strong, liquid-tight lap 
joint or seam. The tube is filled with the desired contents and divided into 
closed packages by repeated heat sealings of the tube, transversely of the 
longitudinal axis of the tube and beneath the level of the contents in the 
tube. The packages are separated from one another by incisions in the 
transverse sealings and are given the desired geometric, normally 
parallelepipedic, final configuration by a further forming and heat sealing 
operation, for the creation of the finished packaging containers.  From the packaging material, configurationally stable, liquid-tight 
packaging containers can also be produced by so-called thermoforming 
which takes as it point of departure the fact that the packaging material is, 
by heat and pressure (or heat and vacuum), formed into bowl or cup-shaped 
containers which are filled with the desired contents and thereafter 
sealed with the aid of a thermoplastic foil which is applied over the 
openings of the containers and is welded in place by heat sealing around 
the
