<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for feeding x-ray film cassettes from a 
storage supply to a daylight loading and unloading unit, said device consisting 

of a cassette stacking device (1) which is releasably connected 
with the daylight loading and unloading unit (111) by a locking mechanism 

(17, 17a) and whose stacking planes (11a to 11k) can be aligned by means 
of electromechanical setting means (9) with the cassette entrance plane 

(112) of the loading and unloading unit (111) in any order desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for feeding x-ray film cassettes from a 
storage supply to a daylight loading and unloading unit. Devices for the automatic loading and unloading of x-ray film cassettes are 
described for example in DE-PS 31 22 583 and DE-PS 37 05 851. In the case of the apparatus known from DE-PS 31 22 583, a plurality of 
identically sized magazine units are provided which are arranged in a 
frame and contain a number of supply magazines also identically sized and 
adapted to be loaded with unexposed film stacks of different formats. An 
unloading and feeding device each associated with a supply magazine is 
used to remove a film from one of the supply magazines and to subsequently 
feed it to a film cassette. Above the supply magazines, another 
magazine unit is provided for receiving the x-ray film cassette. The cassette loaded with an exposed film is unloaded and loaded by an 
automatic process of a type known per se. The automatic film loading device disclosed in DE-PS 37 05 851 includes a 
transfer means for the loading of a sheet film cassette, said means allowing 
a sheet film to be removed from a selected supply magazine and subsequently 
the whole device to be moved up to the level of the cassette to 
be loaded where the film is placed in the cassette. Both devices are disadvantageous in that only one single sheet film cassette 
at a time can be fed to the loading and unloading apparatus. Moreover 
the operator is tied to the device until the loaded cassette can be 
removed again. DE-PS 37 33 191 discloses a processing and handling apparatus for x-ray 
film cassettes which allows cassettes to be processed to be stacked before 
and after they are fed to the unit concerned.  In the case of another known device (DE-PS 12 07 210) for feeding sheet 
film cassettes to a loading and unloading unit, a plurality of hooks is provided 
to which the cassettes are attached and which allow them to be loaded 
or unloaded as well as fed to a film processor in the order of their 
attachment. Both of these apparatus are disadvantageous in that the x-ray film cassettes 
are fed for loading and unloading in a predetermined unchangeable 
order, i.e. one after the other. Moreover, the feeding operation cannot be 
interrupted in order that an intermediately introduced film be processed, 
since processing occurs in a predetermined order. It is an object of the invention to design a device of the generic type 
such that both individual x-ray film cassettes can be fed in a reliable 
manner and a

<CLAIMS>
Device for feeding x-ray film cassettes from a storage supply to a 
daylight loading and unloading unit (111), characterized by a cassette 

stacking device (1) which is releasably connected with a daylight 
loading and unloading unit (111) by a locking mechanism (17, 

17a) and whose stacking planes (11a to 11k) can be aligned with the 
cassette entrance plane (112) of the loading and unloading unit (111) 

by electromechanical setting means (9) in any order desired. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cassette stacking 
device (1) consists of a magazine (2) which includes a plurality 

of compartments (1a to 1k), is drivable via a threaded spindle (11) 
with a toothed rim (16) by a driving motor (9) provided with a gear 

(9a), and is movable along guide columns (6). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that in the side walls of 
each compartment (1a to 1k), light barriers (19a to 19k) are arranged 

at the cassette entrance side (EG) and light barriers (19a' to 19k') 
are arranged at the cassette exit side, the signals generated by said 

light barriers being applicable to an electronic storage and control 
unit. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that a positioning and 
transport device (23) allowing cassettes to be fed independently of 

their formats is arranged on the stacking device (1) in the cassette 
entrance plane (112) of the loading and unloading unit (111). 
Device according to claims 1 and 4, characterized in that the positioning 
and transport device (23) is composed of two unconnected, horizontally 

movable endless belt units (23a, 23b) having belt sections 
(25c) for positioning and transporting the cassette which are disposed 

parallel to each other and approximately at right angles to the 
loading and unloading unit (111) in the cassette entrance plane 

(112). 
Device according to claims 1, 4 and 5, characterized in that the horizontal 
displacement of the endless belt units (23a, 23b) is limited by 

power clutches (25a, 25b) arranged in the displacement path and in 
that the endless belt drives (26a, 26b) can be switched on and off.
