<ABSTRACT>
An ink absorbing member (11) is inserted in an 
ink tank housing (12) which at least partly has a 

transparent portion. Used as this ink absorbing 
member (11) is one having a reflection density after 

ink removal which is close to the reflection density 
of a melamine foam before ink injection. The amount 

of ink remaining in a cartridge of such a 
construction can be detected, for example, by a 

separate line sensor (101). The results of 
detection by the line sensor (101) can be displayed 

by a remaining ink amount indicator (52) provided on 
a control panel (51) of the printing apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink tank, an
ink tank-integrated head cartridge constructed of
the ink tank and an ink head integrated with the ink
tank, and an ink jet printing apparatus having the
ink tank or the head cartridge, and more
particularly, to an improved construction with an
absorbing member for holding ink provided in the ink
tank. Here, printing refers to processes involving
the imparting of ink to any of ink supports to be
inked, such as cloth, yarn or sheet materials. The
present invention can be used for all information
processing devices, or instruments including
printers as their output devices.Of print heads of the ink jet type, a print head
is known to have beating elements and eject a
printing liquid such as ink (hereinafter referred to
as ink) by utilizing thermal energy generated by the
heating elements. In the print head, the heating
elements or ink orifices can be miniaturized. Thus,
the use of a print head of this type permits the
printing of highly accurate images. This type of 
ejection also enables relatively high speed and low
noise printing.In addition to the above-described advantages,
this type of print head can be produced by the same
film forming step as for a semiconductor device, so
that its price can be rendered relatively low.
Hence, a proposal has been made of a head cartridge
constructed of such a print head and an ink tank
integrated with the print head and being attachable
to and detachable from the apparatus. With such a
construction, it becomes possible to replace the ink
tank together with the print head by a new head
cartridge when the ink in the ink tank has been used
up.In such a head cartridge, fresh ink in an amount
corresponding to the amount of ink consumed by the
print head needs to be fed to the print head through
a feed port from a liquid reservoir serving as an
ink tank for holding ink. Furthermore, when ink
need not be fed because no printing is done, ink is
required not to leak from the feed port to the
outside of the reservoir.Such a requirement is important for the above
reservoir used in the ink jet system of the kind
performing printing by ejecting ink from the print
head, particularly in consideration of the possible
influence of the feed amount of ink on image
quality. As ink tanks fulfilling that requirement,
the forms described below have been heretofore
known.Fig. 1 is a sectional view illustrating the
internal structure of an ink tank in a head
cartridge for use in a conventional ink jet printing
apparatus. In Fig. 1, the
