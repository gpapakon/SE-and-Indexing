<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device
having a stationary fulcrum according to the preamble of
claim 1 and 2 respectively.
Such a device is known from EP-A-427872.A lever apparatus is widely used in the field of
machinery, such as machine tools and industrial
machines, and in the power transmission portions of
moving mechanisms of structures of various types.
FIGS. 1 and 2 show examples of a power transmission
mechanism that utilizes the principles of a lever.In the example shown in FIG. 1, pin links 13 and 14
are provided for the circumferential portions of a disk
12 rotatable with a stationary fulcrum as a center, such
that the pin links 13 and 14 are apart from each other
by 90Â°. The pin link 13 serving as a force point is
coupled, through a coupling member 15a extending in a
tangential direction of the disk 12, to one end of a
driving arm 17 supported by a support shaft 16. The
other end of the driving arm 17 is coupled through a
driving link 18 to a driving section. The pin link 14
serving as an action point is coupled, through 
a coupling member 19a extending in a tangential direction
of the disk 12, to the tip end of a driven section
22 of a hydraulic device 21 supported by a support
shaft 20.In the example shown in FIG. 1, the linear motion
of the driving link 18 rotates the driving arm 17, and
power is transmitted through the coupling member 15a to
the disk 12 (i.e., a lever apparatus) and is further
transmitted through the coupling member 19a to the
hydraulic device 21. However, the pin links 13 and
14, respectively serving as a force point and an
action point, describe an arc when the disk 12 is
rotated. Therefore, each of the coupling members 15a
and 19a does not linearly reciprocate but swings
widthwise. In other words, the linear driving force of
the driving link 18 cannot be transmitted to the coupling
member 19 as a linear operating force.In the example shown in FIG. 2, where a fulcrum
23 is fixed and a force point 24 is lowered, an
action point roller 25 is strained in such a manner as
to bend a coupling member 19b in the indicated
direction. When this type of device is used for a long
time, those portions of a guide 26 which are depicted as
being upper left and lower right portions with reference
to a guide hole are likely to be abraded.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is
to provide a device as defined in claims 1 and 2 respectively. The inventor of the present invention developed
lever apparatuses wherein a fulcrum is moved in accordance
with the rotation of a lever
