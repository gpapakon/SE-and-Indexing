<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a composition comprising a carrier selected from the group consisting of lipoproteins, in particular reconstituted LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein), other microemulsion particles, liposomes and micelles, containing a therapeutically or diagnostically active, lipo- or amphiphilic agent, and associated with a suitable ligand recognizable by its specific (complementary) cell receptor, together with a lysosomotropic agent, for targeting of the active agent to a site of interest, such as cancerous tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
Composition for therapeutic or diagnostic use, process for its preparation and its useFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention is based on the use of a carrier selected from the group consisting of lipoproteins, in particular reconstituted LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) , other types of microemulsion particles, liposomes and micelles, and containing a therapeutically or diagnostical- ly active, lipo- or amphiphilic agent, and associated with a suitable ligand recognizable by its specific (complemen¬ tary) cell receptor, together with a lysosomotropic agent, for targeting of the active agent to the site of interest, such as cancerous tissue, and to optimize the effect thereof at the said site.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONLigand specific receptors on the cell surface mediate both information on the environment as well as nutrients into the cell. Such ligands to be recognized include a range of molecular structures, e.g. growth factors (for example platelet derived growth factor, endothelial cell growth factor, tumor growth factor, nerve growth factor) , hormones (e.g. insulin, vasopressin etc.), extracellular matrix protein (e.g. collagen) and lipoproteins (e.g. low density lipoprotein) . In many cases the binding of the ligand to the cell surface receptor is followed by a clustering of the ligand-receptor complex and subsequent internalization via coated pits, ultimately locating the ligand in ly- sosomes. This pathway is utilized for example by viruses in their entry into cells.It has been known for a long time that people suffering from cancer exhibit a cholesterol level in the serum which is lower than normal. Cholesterol circulates in the blood 

in the form of a lipid-protein complex, primarily as the so-called Low Density Lipoprotein, LDL. LDL is a spherical macromolecule having a diameter of about 180 A. LDL is surrounded by a surface film consisting of phospholipids, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, an of protein, i.e. apolipoprotein B (apo B) . The interior of LDL is formed by cholesterol in esterified form (compounds of fatty acids and cholesterol) , triacylglycerol, retinol, as well as other hydrocarbon soluble compounds.Cells contain on their surfaces specific LDL-receptors which bind to the LDL-particle by specifically recognizing the protein component of the LDL-surface, i.e. apolipopro¬ tein B. The density of LDL-receptors is much higher on cancerous cells than on normal cells and cancer cells bind LDL more effectively. It is evident that the lower serum cholesterol level of cancer patients is
