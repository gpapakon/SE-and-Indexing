<ABSTRACT>
A multi-media call center provides an interface tool for enabling non-technical personnel of a company running the call center to provision and configure the call center from available resources. The calls received (770) by the call center are identified and their attributes useful in queuing the calls are determined (780). Based on the attributes (785), priority ratings are computed for the calls by applying a predetermined function to the attributes (785), and the calls are queued in accordance with their respective priority ratings (790). The weights (720) to be given to the various priority attributes (780) and the initial values of the customer-specific priority attributes (710) are set through the interface tool during the provisioning and configuring process.

patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to call center provisioning, management, supervision, and to call prioritization, queuing, disposition, and routing.2. Background Organizations with more than trivial needs for customer interaction often use call centers to provide services to their customers and to organize sales personnel. A call center is the means by which an organization, e.g., company or "enterprise, " handles customer and other calls, usually with some amount of computer automation. Typically, a call center can handle a considerable volume of inbound and outbound calls at the same time, screen inbound calls, forward them to agents (e.g., customer service representatives) with appropriate skills, and maintain records of the calls and of the call center agents . Call centers have traditionally been used by mail-order catalog companies, telemarketing companies, computer product help 

desks, and other similar organizations that use the telephone to sell or support their products and services.Many call centers use computer-telephony integration (CTI) , also known simply as "computer telephony, " to process telephone calls. These terms refer to the use of computers in managing the calls. Since the advent of the information technology revolution, companies have increasingly felt the need to interact with their customers through alternative communication channels that include, for example, facsimile transmissions, email, and web-based contacts. The alternative channel contacts are generally susceptible to
