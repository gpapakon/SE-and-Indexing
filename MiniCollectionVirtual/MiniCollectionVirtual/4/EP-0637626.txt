<ABSTRACT>
Use of siliconate or of its derivatives in a detergent composition for a dishwasher, as antifoaming agent. The invention also relates to a product characterised in that it includes siliconate or its derivatives, alkali metal silicate supported on alkali metal carbonate and water associated with the silicate, the ratio of water associated with the silicate to the silicate, expressed on a dry basis, being higher than or equal to 33/100. It also relates to a detergent composition for a dishwasher including the abovementioned product.

<CLAIMS>
Use of siliconates as anti-filming agents in a
dishwasher detergent composition, characterized in that

the said siliconates are products corresponding to the
following formula (1):


R-Si(OM)
m
(OH)
3-m

and/or the condensation products of these, in which
formula R is a hydrocarbon residue of 1 to 18 carbon

atoms, substituted where appropriate by an amino, ether,
ester, epoxy, mercapto, cyano or polyglycol group; m is

a real number ranging from 0.1 to 3; M is an alkali

metal, an ammonium or phosphonium group or an alkaline-earth
metal.
Use according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that R is a hydrocarbon residue of 1 to

10 carbon atoms and more particularly of 1 to 6 carbon
atoms.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the siliconates are chosen from

alkali metal siliconates.
Use according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the siliconates correspond to

sodium methylsiliconates or potassium methylsiliconates.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the amount of siliconates or

condensation products thereof is between 0.5 and 20% by
weight in the detergent composition.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the siliconates or condensation 

products thereof are added either to the detergent
composition at the end of the preparation of the

detergent composition formulation, in particular by
spraying, or in a dry form by simple mixing with the

other constituents of the detergent composition; or
alternatively to another liquid compound introduced

during the manufacture of the detergent composition.
Use according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the siliconate adsorbed and/or

absorbed onto an inorganic support which is inert with
respect to the siliconate is added by simple mixing with

the other constituents of the detergent composition.
Use according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the support is an amorphous silico-aluminate

or an agent based on an alkali metal silicate
supported on alkali metal carbonate and water associated

with the silicate, the water associated with the
silicate/silicate ratio, expressed as dry material, being

greater than or equal to 33/100.
Use according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the support is an agent based on

alkali metal silicate supported on alkali metal carbonate
and water associated with the silicate, the water

associated with the silicate/silicate ratio, expressed as
dry material, being greater than or equal to 33/100.
Product, characterized in that it comprises a
siliconate of formula (1)


R-Si(OM)
m
(OH)
3-m

and/or one of its condensation products, in which formula
R is a hydrocarbon residue of 1 to 18 carbon atoms,

substituted where appropriate by an amino, ether, ester,
epoxy, mercapto, cyano or polyglycol group; m is a real

number ranging from 0.1 to 3; M is an alkali metal, an
ammonium or phosphonium group or an alkaline-earth metal;

and an agent based on alkali metal silicate supported on
alkali metal carbonate and based on water associated with

the said silicate, the water associated with the
silicate/silicate ratio, expressed as dry material, being

greater than or equal to 33/100. 
Product according to the preceding claim,
characterized in that the water associated with the

silicate/silicate ratio, expressed as dry material, is
less than or equal to 120/100.
Product according to either of claims 10 and 11,
characterized in that the maximum amount of siliconate or

condensation products thereof present in this product
corresponds to 15 %, preferably to 13 %, of the total

weight of the product.
Product according to one of claims 10, 11 and 12,
characterized in that the minimum amount of siliconate or

condensation products thereof present in this product
corresponds to 2 % of the total weight of the product,

and advantageously corresponds to 3 %.
Product according to any one of claims 10 to 13,
characterized in that the carbonate present in this

product represents from 45 to 75 % of the dry weight of
silicate and of carbonate present, and preferably from 50

to 70 %.
Dishwasher detergent composition, characterized
in that it comprises at least one product according to

any one of claims 10 to 14.
Detergent composition according to claim 15,
characterized in that the product represents 3 to 90% by

weight, preferably 3 to 70 %, of the weight of the said
composition.
Composition according to either of claims 15 and
16, characterized in that it lacks sodium

tripolyphosphate.
