<ABSTRACT>
Methods and machines effective for cutting tobacco or 
tobacco rod incorporate a cutting blade, a cutting edge of 

which is of ceramic material. The ceramic material has a 
superior resistance to wear in comparison with the cutting 

edge of a conventional steel blade and thus the 
requirement for blade feed means and blade sharpening 

means is obviated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to the cutting of 
tobacco in tobacco cutting machines and to the cutting of 
tobacco rod on cigarette making machines. Conventional for cutting lamina tobacco or stem 
tobacco in the preparation of cigarette filler are tobacco 
cutting machines tobacco feed means of which comprise 
upper and lower conveyors, which conveyors are convergent 
in the direction of tobacco feed. Because of the 
convergency of the feed conveyors, tobacco fed between 
them is progressively compressed to form a so-called 
cheese. At exit from the feed means constituted by the 
upper and lower conveyors the cheese passes into a 
passageway in a rigid throat block. Disposed to the 
downstream side of the throat block, i.e. to that side 
remote the feed means, is cutting means generally 
comprising a rotatively drivable cylinder, disposed 
horizontally and perpendicularly to the direction of feed 
of the tobacco, and a number of steel cutting blades, four 
for example, mounted on the cylinder. In operation of 
such tobacco cutting machine, as the compressed tobacco 
cheese is advanced through the passage in the throat block 
towards the downstream, outlet of the passage in the 
block, the cylinder is rotated, in synchronism with the 
feed of the cheese, whereby the cutting edges of the 
cutting blades pass across, and in close proximity to, the  
 
said outlet and, in doing so, effect a cutting of the 
cheese at the forward face thereof. Such a tobacco cutting machine is described in US 
3,117,602. As is disclosed in US 3,117,602, during each rotation 
of a cutting blade, the blade passes into contact with a 
grinding tool, there thereby being effected a sharpening 
action on the cutting edge of the blade. In that such 
continually repeated sharpening actions serve to remove 
metal from the outer, cutting edges of the blades, 
provision is made for the blades to be continuously fed 
outwardly of the cylinder during operation of the cutting 
machine. As is exemplified in US 3,117,602 the structure 
and mechanism requisite to effect such feed of the cutting 
blades is complex, and thus a cylinder so provided is 
costly. It is an object of the subject invention to 
obviate the necessity for such complexities and contingent 
costs of the cylinder. The subject invention provides tobacco cutting 
apparatus comprising tobacco feed means and tobacco 
cutting means, the feed means being operable to feed a 
compressed body of tobacco towards the cutting means and 
the cutting means comprising a cutting blade a
