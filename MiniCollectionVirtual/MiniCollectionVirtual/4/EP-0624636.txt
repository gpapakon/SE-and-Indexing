<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infrared
phosphor which is excited by irradiation with infrared
rays to emit light of infrared wavelength region, and to
a material having latent images and an optical reading
system which use said infrared phosphor.Recently, in various industries such as the
distribution industry, control of goods by means of bar
codes is extensively conducted and furthermore, bar
codes are printed on various prepaid cards and passing
cards and these bar codes are read by optical reading
apparatuses such as scanners to perform the desired
actions. Moreover, various attempts have been made to
apply forgery preventive means to credit cards and
prepaid cards or to detect forged cards. According to
one of them, the marks such as bar codes are printed
with an ink containing a phosphor by offset printing or
by using an ink ribbon to form latent image marks, the
latent image marks are irradiated with a semiconductor
laser beam to excite the phosphor and the light emitted
from the phosphor is received to read the bar code
information by an optical reading apparatus.The phosphors used in the above-mentioned
method are those which are described in USP 4,202,491. However, the conventional phosphors have a large
particle size of larger than 5 µm and cannot be used as
they are in the inks used for offset printing or ink
ribbons and they must be ground. During this grinding
step, crystallinity and composition of the phosphors are
damaged to cause considerable reduction in luminous
intensity. Another problem is reduction in productivity
due to the increase in the number of steps. For this
reason, the systems in which the above phosphors are used
have not yet been able to be put to practical use.Accordingly, the object of the present invention is
to solve the problem of the particle size encountered
with the aforementioned conventional products, namely, to
synthesize infrared phosphors of fine particles suitable
to be used in inks for offset printing or ink ribbons
without the step of grinding and to provide materials
having latent images and optical reading systems which
use the thus obtained infrared phosphors.The first invention for attaining the above object
is.an infrared phosphor comprising a phosphate
represented by the following formula:
LnxB1-xPO4
wherein B represents at least one of Y, La, Gd, Bi, Ce,
Lu, In, Pr and Tb; Ln represents at least one of Nd, Yb
and Er; and x is from 0.01 to 0.99.An Example is YPO4Yb The infrared phosphor can be
excited by infrared rays to emit infrared rays and
