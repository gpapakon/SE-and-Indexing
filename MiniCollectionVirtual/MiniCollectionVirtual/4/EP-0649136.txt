<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of digital signals having total 
data rates of n bit/s or less are input to a digital 

recording device recording digital signals having a 
data rate of n bit/s. The digital signals are subjected 

to format-conversion for the digital recording 
device to be recorded therein. Furthermore, signals 

having a data rate of n/i
1
 bit/s or less are subjected 
to format-conversion to be recorded i
1
 times in the 
digital recording device. In the case where the data 

rate of the digital signals to be input is n/j bit/s, 
the digital signals are subjected to format-conversion 

so that the amount of data capable of being recorded 
per unit time is decreased by i/j; thus, the digital 

signals are recorded for a long period of time under 
the condition that the data recording time is prolonged 

j times. Furthermore, when input data to be recorded 
on a magnetic tape at a normal data rate by using a 

magnetic head mounted on a rotary cylinder is recorded, 
the recording device of the present application makes it 

possible to select a plurality of types of track angles 
generated by the rotation number of the cylinder, the 

tape traveling speed, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
method of recording digital data by using a recording device recording
a data stream having a predetermined data rate of n bit/s on a recording medium.In recent years, various kinds of digital
video cassette recorders (hereinafter, referred to as
DVCRs) for recording video signals such as TV signals
in digital form have been developed. However, since
video signals contain a great amount of information, in
the case where the video signals are recorded in digital
form in a storage medium such as a tape, a long
recording time is required. In view of such a problem,
a method for recording video signals, which are subjected
to high efficiency coding, in digital form has
been proposed, for example in the International Conference
on Consumer Electronics (ICCE) 1989, June 6-9,
Digest of Technical Papers WPM8.6 "AN EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY ON A HOME-USE DIGITAL VTR".In the past, DVCRs record input video signals
in synchronization with a field frequency thereof.
More specifically, a magnetic head mounted in a rotary
cylinder rotating in synchronization with the field
frequency records video signals in tracks each having a
track angle predetermined in accordance with set standards. DVCRs use a rotary cylinder for the purpose
of enhancing a recording density, and record data in
tracks so as to be disposed on a magnetic tape in the
diagonal direction of a magnetic tape traveling direction.
For example, when a magnetic tape is wrapped
around a rotary cylinder provided with two magnetic
heads by about 180 degrees and the rotary cylinder
rotates at a speed of 9000 rpm (rotation per minute),
18000 tracks are recorded on the magnetic tape per
minute.In general, DVCRs reproduce data in the same
state as in the recorded state, except for special
reproduction such as scene search, still, and slow
reproductions. If data is reproduced in the state
different from the recorded state, normal reproduction
cannot be obtained. Thus, in the case of producing
DVCRs, mechanical design specifications such as a track
angle and a tape traveling speed should be strictly
observed.Since there are various kinds of high efficiency
coding, the data rate after being subjected to
high efficiency coding takes various values. Particularly
in pre-recorded soft tapes, etc., the data rate
is required to be decreased by high efficiency coding
for the purpose of reducing tape cost.In recent years, studies to supply digital
video signals at a very low data rate in video services
utilizing a digital TV broadcasting, a CATV, a
