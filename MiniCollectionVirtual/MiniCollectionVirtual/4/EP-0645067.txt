<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method in a radio system, comprising a subscriber database (202) containing data (Y, 203) informing of facilities activated for the subscriber, exchanges (201), base stations (205) and subscriber stations (206). In order to keep the subscriber stations (206) informed of the facilities activated therefor, the facility data (Y, 203) for a given subscriber station (206) are read from the subscriber data base (202) of the radio system and said data (Y, 203) are sent as a facility data message through a base station (205) via a radio path (207) to the subscriber station (206), the subscriber station (206) receives said message containing the facility data (Y) and presents these data (Y, 208) to the subscriber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method in a radio
system, comprising a subscriber database containing
data informing of facilities activated for the subscriber,
exchanges, base stations and subscriber stations,
in order to keep the subscriber stations informed
of the facilities activated therefor.A typical feature of subscriber stations of radio
telephone systems, i.e. radio telephones or other
such terminals, is that the subscriber stations move
within and from a network area, being sometimes outside
the coverage area of the network and thus loosing
the connection with the network. Due to the fact
that a radio telephone may move and operate in the
radio network area of several different operators and
that there is no data communication between the exchanges
of said radio networks, terminals, i.e. radio
telephones moving at times in the area of other radio
networks, may loose connection with their own actual
home radio telephone network. For this reason, a radio
telephone and its user dispose of data of facilities
and services activated for radio telephones
which are different from respective data contained in
the exchange of the home radio telephone network of
the radio telephone.Another typical feature of radio terminals is
that they are used periodically, which means that
they are at times switched on and in communication
with their own radio telephone network and at times
switched off, closed, and thus without communication
with the radio telephone network. Additionally, radio
telephones may sometimes loose connection with the
radio telephone network, because a radio telephone
power source, typically a battery, runs out of power. 
Furthermore, one radio telephone may have several
users in some cases, a typical example of which is
common use of a radio telephone in a company.On account of the above facts, there is also a
risk that a radio terminal and its user, on the one
hand, and an exchange of a radio telephone system and
an associated database, on the other hand, have different
information of which operations have been programmed
in said terminal to be implemented by the exchange
of the radio telephone network. The user of a
radio terminal, for instance, may then believe that
no call transfer has been activated for calls addressed
to said terminal, even though it is so in
reality, and accordingly, the subscriber waits for
calls to come to his terminal in vain, since these
calls have been transferred elsewhere. In addition to
said call transfer facility or call diversion facility,
being a facility by

<CLAIMS>
A method in a radio system, comprising
a subscriber database (202) containing data

(Y,203) informing of facilities activated for the
subscriber, exchanges (201), base stations (205) and

subscriber stations (206), in order to keep the subscriber
stations (206) informed of the facilities

activated therefor, 
characterized
 in
that


facility data (Y, 203) for a given subscriber
station (206) are read from the subscriber data base

(202) of the radio system and that said data (Y, 203)
are sent as a facility data message through a base

station (205) via a radio path (207) to the subscriber
station (206), and
the subscriber station (206) receives said message
containing the facility data (Y) and presents

these data (Y, 208) to the subscriber.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the transmission of the message
containing said facility data (Y, 203) occurs

when the subscriber station (206) enters the radio
system.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the transmission of the message
containing said facility data (Y, 203) occurs

when the subscriber station (206) tries to request
the radio system to start some facility, the data of

which facility are stored in the subscriber data base
(202) as per subscriber.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the message containing said
facility data (Y, 203) is transmitted at desired intervals

to the subscriber station (206). 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the message containing said
facility data (Y, 203) is transmitted to the subscriber

station (206) when there is free transfer
capacity on the radio path (207) between the base

station (205) and the subscriber station (206).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the message containing said
facility data (Y, 203) is transmitted to the subscriber

station (206) when the subscriber station
(206) requests for a transmission of the facility

data (Y, 203) to the subscriber station (206) by
sending a facility data request message.
A method according to any of the foregoing
claims, 
characterized
 in that said facility
data message contains an information (Y, 203)

of a call transfer facility activated for the subscriber
(206).
A method according to claim 1 to 6,

characterized
 in that said facility data
message contains an information (Y, 203) of a call

restriction facility activated for the subscriber
(206).
