<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nonferrous material sorting
apparatus which makes it possible to sort nonferrous materials
in accordance with every three kinds or more of sizes.As shown in Fig. 12, a conventional nonferrous
material sorting apparatus (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-102274)
is operated such that light covered pieces and heavy
copper pieces constituting the materials to be sorted are
mixed with powdery bodies constituting a fluidized bed used as
media, and the light covered pieces lighter than the powdery
bodies and the heavy copper pieces heavier than the powdery
bodies are respectively sorted to an upper portion and a lower
portion by a vibrated sorting deck S and a separation plate P,
while making use of the difference in relative specific gravity
between the materials to be sorted and the powdery bodies.However, since the conventional apparatus described
above is operated to sort the materials to be sorted to the
upper and lower layers by the sorting deck S and the separation
plate P due to the difference in relative specific gravity
between the materials to be sorted and the powdery bodies
constituting the fluidized bed used as media, it involves such
a problem that the weight and size of the materials to be 
sorted are restricted by the weight and size of the powdery
bodies. Further, since the resistance of the materials to be
sorted settling through the powdery bodies is varied depending
on the size of the materials to be sorted, it has been
necessary to regulate the size of the materials to be sorted
within a certain range. Thus, there has been such a problem
that some materials to be sorted cannot be sorted by the
conventional apparatus described above due to the kinds
and sizes thereof. EP-A- 524 396 discloses an apparatus for sorting material comprising metallic and non-metallic
parts, comprising: a first screening device for screening materials of not more than
a minimum reference size; a first sorting device for sorting the materials screened by the
first screening device; a second screening device for screening the materials into materials
of at least two kinds of reference sizes larger than said minimum reference size; and a
second sorting device for sorting materials screened by the second screening device. An object of the present invention is to provide a
nonferrous material sorting apparatus based on such a technical
concept of the present invention that nonferrous materials to
be sorted are screened into materials of a plurality of size
ranges by a screening device, and
