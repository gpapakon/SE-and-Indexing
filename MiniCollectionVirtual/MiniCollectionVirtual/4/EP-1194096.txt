<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an adhesive bandage (10) comprising a support (11) with an adhesive surface (12), a sterile pad (13) arranged on said adhesive surface and a protective film covering the adhesive surface and the sterile pad, which is formed by a first (14) and a second (15) tearaway tab. The first tab (14) is folded back on itself along a folding line (16), outside the sterile pad zone, to define a first flap (17) applied on the adhesive surface from a first end of the support up to the folding line and covering entirely the sterile pad, and a second flap (18) forming a tearing lead for the first flap and extending over said first flap beyond the support first end. The second tab (15) comprises a third flap (19) applied on the adhesive surface from the second end of the support up to the folding line, and a fourth flap (20) forming a tearing lead for the third flap which extends over the first tab from the folding line beyond the support first end.

An adhesive bandage, in particular, for application on an acutely affected
area of the epidermis which is very sensitive to contamination by bacterial

germs and must remain sterile, notably, an area comprising a site for the
implementation of an arteriovenous fistula giving vascular access to a

patient on hemodialysis, the said adhesive bandage comprising a support
with an adhesive side, a sterile pad situated on the said adhesive side of

the support and a protective film covering the adhesive side and the sterile
pad, the said protective film being made up of a first and a second

detachable tab, the said first detachable tab being folded back on itself
along a folding line, outside the sterile pad area and comprising a first flap

applied on the adhesive side of the support and which extends at least
from a first extremity of the said support towards its interior until the said

folding line in such a way as to cover entirely the sterile pad, and a second
flap consisting of a beginning which tears off from the said first flap and

which extends over the said first flap from the said folding line in the
direction of the said first extremity of the support, the said second

detachable tab comprising a third flap applied on the adhesive side of the
support, and which extends, outside the area of the sterile pad, at least

from a second extremity of the said support, opposite the said first
extremity, towards the interior of the said support until the said folding line

of the first detachable tab, 
characterised in that
 the said second
detachable tab (15) is arranged to be lifted from the adhesive side (12) of

the support (11) before the first detachable tab (14), 
in that
 the said second
flap (18) extends over the said first flap (17) at least beyond the area of the

sterile pad (13) in the direction of the said first extremity of the support
(11), and 
in that
 the said second detachable tab (15) comprises a fourth
flap (20) consisting of a beginning which tears off from the said third flap

(19) and which extends over the said first detachable tab (14) from the said
folding line (16) at least beyond the area of the sterile pad (13) in the

direction of the said first extremity of the support (11). 
An adhesive bandage according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
said fourth flap (20) has a length greater than that of the said first flap

(17) and extends beyond the said first extremity of the support (11).
An adhesive bandage according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
said second flap (18) has a length greater than that of the said first flap

(17) and extends beyond the said first extremity of the support (11).
An adhesive bandage according to claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that

the said second flap (18) has a length greater than that of the said
fourth flap (20) and extends beyond the said fourth flap (20).
