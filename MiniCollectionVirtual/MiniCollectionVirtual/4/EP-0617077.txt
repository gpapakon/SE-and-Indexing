<ABSTRACT>
Composition including an unsaturated elastomer and a plasticiser from the polyphenylmethane class in sufficient quantity to lower the glass transition temperature of the elastomer to make it a rubber. The unsaturated elastomer is chosen from polynorbornene, SBR or polybutadiene. The polyphenylmethanes may be dibenzyltoluene, tribenzyltoluene or polybenzyltoluenes.
