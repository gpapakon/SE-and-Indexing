<ABSTRACT>
The method enables the starting of the balance, without the test displays first appearing and having to be confirmed by the operating person. After a power failure, on the other hand, the balance first runs through the test mode. The starting is carried out by actuating the tare key or by placing a weight on the weighing pan.

<CLAIMS>
A process for starting up a balance (9), in which the balance
(9) is started up from the stand-by mode by applying a weight to the

weighing pan or by actuating the calibration key (7) and, skipping the
test displays, is taken by software means directly into a weighing mode

with display of the applied weight or with zero display.
A process according to claim 1 wherein after an interruption in
power the balance is only put into a weighing mode after confirmation of the

test displays.
An electronic balance having a measuring cell, a digital signal
processing unit for processing and displaying different weighing programs,

a display panel (3) for alphanumeric display of the measurement values and
a keyboard panel (5) for electronic calibration of the display and for

selecting and configuring a start-up program, characterised by a rapid-start
program (QuickStart) which can be switched on, in which when the

balance is started up out of the stand-by mode by actuation of a key (7)
or by applying a weight to the weighing pan the optically indicated test

displays are skipped and the weighing mode is directly displayed.
A balance according to claim 3 characterised in that it is
provided with a program which after an interruption in power prior to the

rapid-start program runs through the entire start-up program with the test
displays and displays the latter.
