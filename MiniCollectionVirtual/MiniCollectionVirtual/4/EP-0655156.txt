<ABSTRACT>
For industrial applications, there is a need for compact ultrasonic transducers whose radiation diagram exhibits small side-lobes. This requirement is met by an ultrasonic transducer of conventional design with a piezo-electric transducer element (1) over whose main surface (7) is bonded a disc-shaped (lambda)/4 matching element (2), the invention calling for the edge surface (3) of the (lambda)/4 matching element to have a notch (4) of an appropriate depth (5).

Ultrasonic transducer having a piezoelectric 
disc-shaped transducer element (1) which is provided with 

a rotationally symmetrical, disc-shaped λ/4 matching 
element (2), characterized in that the λ/4 matching 

element (2) has a notch (4, 9, 10, 11) on its circumferential 
surface (3) and/or on its rear surface (8) facing 

the transducer element (1), and in that the circumferential 
surface (3) of the notch (4) has a depth (5) of up 

to at most 1/4 of the disc diameter (6) of the matching 
element (2), and in that the fractional surface of the 

surface (8) covered by the notch (4, 9, 10, 11) is 
smaller than the end face of the transducer element (1). 
Ultrasonic transducer according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the circumferential surface (3) 

outside the notch (4) corresponds to the lateral surface 
of a regular cylinder. 
Ultrasonic transducer according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the circumferential surface (3) has 

a notch (4) at least of such a depth (5) that, given 
circular surfaces of unequal size at the top side and 

underside of the λ/4 matching element (2), said notch 
cuts t
he imaginary lateral cylinder surface projected 
into it and proceeding from the smaller circular surface. 
Ultrasonic transducer according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the piezoelectric 

transducer element (1) has a diameter D, and in 
that the underside circular surface (8), facing the 

transducer element (1), of the λ/4 matching element (2) 
has a diameter of between 0.8 × D and 1.2 × D. 
Ultrasonic transducer according to one of the  
 

preceding claims, characterized in that the depth of the 
notch (4) is 0.05 - 0.15 of the disc diameter (6) of the 

matching element (2). 
Ultrasonic transducer according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the entire 

ultrasonic transducer, except for the side of the matching 
element (2) facing the medium to be inspected, is 

provided with a foam encapsulation. 
Ultrasonic transducer according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the foam encapsulation essentially 

comprises polyurethane. 
Ultrasonic transducer according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the λ/4 matching 

element (2) comprises syntactic foam. 
Ultrasonic transducer according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the notch on the 

rear surface (8) of the matching element (2) is designed 
as a cylindrical cutout (9) having a depth of up to at 

most half the thickness of the matching element (2). 
Ultrasonic transducer according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that the notch (4) on the rear 

surface (8) of the matching element (2) exists in the 
form of concentric, annular grooves (10, 11) having a 

depth of up to at most half the thickness of the matching 
element (2).
