<ABSTRACT>
An improved font resolution method is disclosed for a data 
processing system, which enables the translation of an 

originally defined font for a document, into available fonts 
in a local data processing system where the document is to be 

displayed or printed. The method allows for the selective 
substitution by a user of alternate Code Page Names and 

Character Set Names for fonts which may be available on a 
local data processing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing 
systems and methods and more particularly relates to the 
resolution of diverse font definitions for the printing or 
display of stored document text. FONTs are used to print or display character data using a 
combination of metrics (size and positioning data) and raster 
patterns (shape and density of blackness). Each specific FONT 
is uniquely defined by a specific combination of a Code Page 
and a Character Set. A Code Page equates specific characters 
(hexadecimal values) to unique Character Identifications. A 
Character Set equates those same Character Identifications to 
specific metrics and raster patterns. Each Code Page and each
 
Character Set is stored as a member in a Font Library. The 
name of each such member is the name of the respective Code 
Page or Character Set. The Font Library may also contain members called Coded 
Fonts. Each Coded Font contains the name of one Code Page and 
one Character Set, which, in combination, define a specific 
FONT. The name of each Code Font member is the name of the 
Coded Font.  Within the Mixed Object Document Content Architecture 
(MO:DCA), a FONT is specified by a Map Coded Font (MCF) 
structure, of which there are two (2) formats, one of which is 
obsolete but is still supported for compatibility in some 
implementations. Depending on which of the MCF formats is 
used and which of the optional data and fields are utilized 
within the format used, a specific FONT can be specified by 
any one of the following (sets of) values: 
1. Coded Font Name; or 2. Code Page Name AND Character Set Name; or 3. Global Resource ID (GRID), in combination with any of the 
following Optional Font Modifiers which may be supplied: 
a) Font Weight Class value - specifies character stroke 
thickness; b) Font Width Class value - specifies character 
width-to-height ratio; c) Italics Characters indicator; d) Underscored Characters indicator; e) Outline Characters indicator; f) Overstruck Characters indicator; g) Proportionally Spaced Characters indicator; h) Kerned Characters indicator. i) Character Rotation value (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees - 
0 degrees assumed if not specified). Due to the methods by which these values are specified 
within the MCF formats, it is possible that more than one of 
the above values may be specified. The Global Resource ID (GRID) is an eight byte, hexadecimal 
value which is composed of four (4) two byte, hexadecimal 
values, as follows:  1. Code Page Global ID (CPGID) 2. Graphic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
In a data processing system, a method for font resolution 
between a first defined font in a document architecture 

and a second available font within the data processing 
system, comprising the steps of: 

loading data interpretation tables into the data 
processing system; 

loading a Font Substitution Table into the data 
processing system; 

loading a locally available Font Library into the data 
processing system; 

loading a source document which includes a map coded font 
structure into the data processing system; 

getting said map coded font structure and parsing it in 
the data processing system; 

matching parsed names extracted from said map coded font 
structure against said Font Substitution Table; 

generating an initial Code Page Name and an initial 
Character Set Name from said Font Substitution Table; 

searching said Font Library for a working Code Page Name 
and a working Character Set Name; 

printing said document using said working Code Page Name 
and said working Character Set Name on a printer in said 

data processing system. 
The method of claim 1 which further comprises: 
if said step of matching parsed names against said Font 

Substitution Table fails to generate an initial Code Page 
Name and an initial Character Set Name, the method 

further comprising the steps of: 
matching said parse names against said data 

interpretation tables; 
generating an initial Code Page Name and an initial 

Character Set Name; 
searching said Font Library for a working Code Page Name 

and a working Character Set Name; 
outputting said working Code Page Name and said working 

Character Set Name derived from said data interpretation 
tables to print and display said document in said data 

processing system. 
The method of claim 2 which further comprises: 
if said step of parsing said names against said data 

interpretation tables fails to generate an initial Code 
Page Name and an initial Character Set Name, the method 

further comprising the steps of: 
looking up an alternate Code Page Name and an alternate 

Character Set Name in said data interpretation tables; 
searching for said alternate Code Page Name and said 

Alternate Character Set Name in said Font Library; 
outputting a working Code Page Name and a working 

Character Set Name to print and display said document on 
said printer and said display in said data processing 

system.
