<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for detecting changes in quality of bulk 
goods on moving conveyor belts, having a pulsed 

monochromatic light source (1),
characterised by
a frequency multiplier (2) coupled to the light 
source (1) for producing several light beams of 

different wave length, 
several optical means for deflecting (4) and 
diverging (5) the light beams, which are disposed in 

such a manner that each of several defined regions 
(6) disposed one behind the other in the direction 

of movement of the conveyor belt (7) is irradiated 
with a light beam of a defined wave length, 
in each case detector systems assigned to each of 
these regions, which in each case comprise means for 

sampling (8) the defined region, means for selecting 
wave length ranges (9), means for detecting light 

signals from the defined region and for converting 
said signals into an electric signal (10) and 
means for pulsing (11) the light source in 
dependence on the running speed of the conveyor belt 

(7) in such a manner that the same region of a bulk 
article is located in succession in the various 

regions (6) defined by the optical means, where it 
is radiated by the different wavelengths. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the pulsed light source (1) is a 
laser. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the laser radiates monochromatic 
light from the wavelength range of 230 to 1,200  

 
nanometres (nm), such as for example an Nd:YAG laser, 

which radiates with a wave length of 1,064 nm. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a frequency multiplier (2) doubles 
to quadruples the frequency or several frequency 

multipliers produce a random multiplication and 
consequently a light beam having two or more wavelengths. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the frequency multiplier (2) 
quadruples the frequency and in the case of a initial 

wavelength of 1,064 produces a light beam having the 
wavelengths of 1,064 nm, 532 nm and 266 nm. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the pulsing means (11) pulse the 
laser (1) in dependence on the running speed of the 

conveyor belt (7) and thus in succession effect the 
radiant exposure of the same region of the bulk article 

with light beams of different wave length in the defined 
regions (6) disposed with equal spacing to one another.
