<ABSTRACT>
A number of boiler modules (1a, 1b) have an intermediate- and low-pressure turbine (10) which is common to these boiler modules as well as a separate high-pressure turbine (5a, 5b) for the respective boiler module (1a, 1b). The different high-pressure turbines (5a, 5b) are adapted in flow capacity to their respective boiler module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plant concept for power plants 
comprising boiler modules with reheating of steam for 
turbines in a common steam system. In power plants where more than one boiler module is used 
for generation of steam in separate steam generators for the 
respective boiler modules, steam from the respective steam 
generators may drive a steam turbine which is common to the 
boiler modules. If the steam generator in each boiler module 
comprises a high-pressure superheater and a reheater, the 
high-pressure steam from the different boiler modules is 
passed via valves to a common high-pressure turbine, where 
the steam expands and delivers energy, whereafter the steam 
is returned to the boiler modules for reheating in a reheater 
in the respective boiler module. The steam from the 
different reheaters is then passed to an intermediate-pressure 
and low-pressure turbine common to the modules, 
whereafter the steam after condensing is passed to a tank 
for feedwater, from which the water is utilized for new 
steam generation. One reason for utilizing fewer turbines than the number of 
boiler modules occurring is the considerable saving of costs 
for the installation of fewer steam turbine units in the 
plant. In the normal operating range, that is, 30% to 100% power 
output from the plant, sliding pressure control is nowadays 
used. By this is meant that the pressure of the high-pressure 
steam, in the following called live steam, as well 
as the pressure of the reheater steam are approximately 
proportional to the steam flow. During start-up and shutdown  
 
of the plant and in case of turbine trip (emergency stop of 
the turbine), the control of the boiler and the turbine, 
respectively, is performed in the most careful way. This 
means that the pressure in the reheater, determined by the 
pressure in the intermediate-pressure and low-pressure 
turbine, and hence the volume flow (the steam rate) through 
the high-pressure superheater and the reheater in the load 
range vary within acceptable limits without any special 
control. If two boilers comprising reheaters are installed with a 
common steam turbine for both boilers, no problems arise for 
the high-pressure outlet of the steam turbine and for the 
reheaters of the boilers since the two boilers are driven 
with the same power. The individual boilers and the steam 
turbine have the same load expressed as a percentage. On the 
other hand, the distribution of the steam flows of the reheaters 
in the two boilers must be controlled in

<CLAIMS>
A boiler plant comprising at least two boilers (1a, 1b) 
with a common steam system, wherein in each separate boiler 

a superheater (2a, 2b) and a reheater (3a, 3b) are arranged 
for generation and/or heating of steam and wherein the steam 

from said boilers drives high-pressure turbines (5a, 5b) and 
an intermediate- and low-pressure turbine (10), 
characterized
 
in that steam from the high-pressure 

superheaters (2a, 2b) in the separate boilers (1a, 1b) 
drives separate high-pressure turbines (5a, 5b) whereas 

reheated steam from the respective reheaters (3a, 3b) is 
passed to and drives an intermediate-pressure/low pressure 

turbine (10) which is common to the boilers (1a, 1b).  
 
A boiler plant according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the high-pressure turbines (5a, 5b), the intermediate-pressure/low-pressure 
turbine (10) and a generator (12) 

common to the turbines are arranged on the same shaft with 
the high-pressure turbines (5a, 5b) connected to the shaft 

over couplings (14a, 14b). 
A boiler plant according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one of the high-pressure turbines (5a, 5b) is 
arranged and drives a generator (G1, G3) on a separate 

shaft. 
A boiler plant according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
 
in that each boiler (1a, 1b) and the high-pressure 

turbine (5a, 5b) belonging to the respective boiler 
can be driven at partial load to the same degree by means of 

throttling valves (15a, 15b) associated with each of the 
reheaters (3a, 3b).
