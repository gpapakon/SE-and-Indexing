<ABSTRACT>
Prostheses, for example hip prostheses, have a prosthetic stem (5) which is anchored in a bone cavity by means of bone cement. During introduction of the prosthetic stem (5) into the prepared bone cavity the bone cement is displaced and forced outwards in the gap between the bone cavity and the prosthetic stem. In order to influence flowing-out in a controlled manner, a striplike sealing element (1) is wrapped around the prosthetic stem (5). The striplike sealing element (1) comprises a clamping or closing device (4) and an adjoining wrapped-around section (2) which ends in a terminal section (3). The clamping or closing device (4) has the task of maintaining the terminal section (3) under a tensile stress (16), so that the entire striplike sealing element (1) is wrapped around the prosthetic stem (5) under a prestress. The terminal section (3) is illustrated in two possible positions, namely as a terminal section (3a) in the loose state and as terminal section (3b) in the fixed state in which the terminal section (3b) is looped through the clamping device (4) and maintained under prestress (16) by the latter. The terminal section (3) ends in a tip (7) which facilitates threading of the terminal section (3) into the clamping device (4) between a jaw (4a) and a resilient tongue (4b).

Sealing element (1) for the sealing of the gap resulting during the
introduction of a shaft (5) of a prosthesis into the hollow cavity of a

bone between the opening of the hollow cavity and the shaft (5) of
the prosthesis, characterized in that the sealing element (1) is of

band-like form, comprises a clamping or closure device (4) and a
wrapping section (2) adjoining it, which runs out into an end section

(3), with the end section (3) being introducible into the clamping or
closure device (4), and wherein the sealing element (1) can be

brought into contact with the shaft (5) of the prosthesis in an arrangement
surrounding it.
Sealing element (1) in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that
the end section (3) and the clamping or closure device (4) are designed

to mutually cooperate in such a way that the end section (3)
is non-yieldably held in the clamping or closure device (4).
Sealing element (1) in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that
the end section (3) and the clamping or closure device (4) are designed

to mutually cooperate in such a way that the end section (3)
is yieldably held in the clamping or closure device (4) in dependence

on the tension force that is exerted.
Sealing element (1) in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that
the end section (3) and the clamping or closure device (4) are designed

to mutually cooperate in such a way that the end section (3)
is yieldably held in the clamping or closure device (4) and the tension

force exerted by the end section (3) onto the clamping or closure
device (4) remains approximately constant. 
Sealing element (1) in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that
the end section (3) and the clamping or closure device (4) are designed

to mutually cooperate in such a way that the end section (3)
is yieldably held in the clamping or closure device (4) and the

clamping or closure device (4) releases a part length of the end section
(3) stepwise when a specific tension force is exceeded.
Sealing element (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the wrapping section (2) is made inelastic.
Sealing element (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the wrapping section (2) is made elastic.
Sealing element (1) in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the wrapping section (2) is made with two layers

along its direction of extent and consists of an elastic layer (2c)
and a less elastic layer (2b).
Sealing element (1) in accordance with claim 8, characterized in that
the less elastic wrapping section (2b) runs out into the end section

(3), which is intended to enter into co-operating connection with the
clamping or closure device (4) (3).
Sealing element (1) in accordance with one of the claims 3 to 9,
characterized in that the clamping or closure device (4) has a resilient

tongue (4b) with a tooth (4d) and in that the end piece (3) has a
toothed region (6) with teeth (6h) spaced apart in the longitudinal direction,

with the flank angle of the teeth (6h) and also of the tooth
(4d) together with the spring force of the tongue (4b) jointly determining

the maintainable tension force.
