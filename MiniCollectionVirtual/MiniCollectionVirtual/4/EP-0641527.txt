<ABSTRACT>
A method for inflating a bladder (10) including a first and a second 
distinct 

chamber (16,18;20a,20b) linked in fluid communication by an 
interconnecting 

port (24b) and a fluid fill inlet (26) linked in fluid communication 
with the first 

chamber (16,18). A first nozzle set at a first predetermined pressure 
level and 

connected to a first fluid pressure source is inserted in the fill 
inlet (26) to 

thereby inflate the first and second chambers (16,18;20a,20b) to the first 
predetermined pressure. The interconnecting port (24b) is sealed to 

isolate the 
first chamber (16,18) from the second chamber (20a,20b) out of fluid 

communication with each other such that the second chamber (20a,20b) is 
isolated at the first predetermined pressure. 
The application is further directed to a shoe midsole, including a 
bladder having a plurality of distinct chambers at different pressures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a bladder for a shoe midsole, and in
particular, to a bladder having a plurality of distinct chambers, with at least one
chamber pressurized to a different pressure than the remaining chambers, and a
method for so inflating the bladder.Bladders used for cushioning shoes are known in the art. Such bladders
generally are made of an elastomeric material and are formed so as to have an
upper or lower surface enclosing one or more chambers therebetween. The
chambers are pressurized above ambient pressure by insertion of a nozzle or
needle connected to a fluid pressure source into a fill inlet formed in the bladder.
After the chambers are pressurized, the fill inlet is sealed, for example, by
welding, and the nozzle is removed. A bladder pressurized in this fashion is 
disposed during manufacture of a shoe between the outsole and the insole for at
least a portion of the extent of the shoe. Thus, the bladder forms all or part of the
midsole of the shoe and serves to provide cushioning. If desired, a conventional
foam material may be disposed between the outsole and insole at the locations not
occupied by the bladder to serve as the cushioning midsole at those locations.
Further, the bladder may be partially or totally encapsulated by the foam.Bladders of this type may be manufactured by the prior art two-film
technique in which two separate sheets of elastomeric film are formed having the
overall peripheral shape of the bladder. The sheets may be welded together along
the periphery to form a bladder having upper, lower and side surfaces, and at
predetermined interior areas to give the bladder a preferred configuration, that is,
to have chambers of a predetermined shape and size at desired locations.
Alternatively, the two sheets may be vacuum-formed to have the preferred
configuration and then welded together. In either case, the bladder is formed so
as to have one or more fluid inlets through which a needle can be inserted to
inflate the various chambers.Bladders also may be manufactured by the prior art blow-molding technique.
A liquified elastomeric material is placed in a mold having the desired overall
shape and configuration of the bladder. The mold has an opening at one location
through which pressurized air is provided. The pressurized air forces the liquified
elastomeric material against the inner surfaces of the mold and causes the material
to harden in the mold to form a bladder having the preferred shape and 
configuration. A sprue appendage is formed at the

<CLAIMS>
An inflated bladder, in or for a shoe midsole, the bladder (10) comprising a pair
of side flanking chambers (16, 18) lin
ked together by an interconnecting port (24c)
and at least one intermediate chamber (20a, 20b, 20c) disposed between said side flanking

chambers said interconnecting port providing a manifold section (24b, 24c) of said
bladder which is common to each of said chambers (16, 18, 20c), said side flanking

chambers being in fluid communication with one another but in fluid isolation from
the at least one intermediate chamber (20) and wherein said side flanking chambers are

pressurized to a first pressure level and said at least one intermediate chamber (20) is
pressurized to a second pressure level such that the stiffness of the side flanking

chambers is different to that of said at least one intermediate chamber.
The inflated bladder as claimed in claim 1 wherein the second predetermined
pressure is greater than the first predetermined pressure.
The inflated bladder claimed in claim 2 wherein the second predetermined
pressure has a value in a range of 1.05 - 3.5 kg/cm
2
 (15-50 psi) above ambient
pressure and the first predetermined pressure has a value in a range of ambient

pressure to 1.05 kg/cm
2
 (15 psi) above ambient pressure.
The inflated bladder claimed in claim 3 wherein the second predetermined
pressure is 1.75 kg/cm
2
 (25 psi) above ambient pressure and the first
pressure is 0.35 kg/cm
2
 (5 psi) above ambient pressure.
The inflated bladder claimed in claim 1 wherein the second predetermined
pressure is less than the first predetermined pressure.
