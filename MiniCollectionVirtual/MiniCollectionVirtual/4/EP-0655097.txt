<ABSTRACT>
A wet-laid nonwoven fabric comprises a blend of 1 to 50 % by weight of fibres of a water-swellable water-insoluble superabsorbent polymer and 99 to 50 % by weight of less absorbent fibres, for example fibres having an absorbency of less than 10 g/g measured by retention to centrifuging of a 0.9 % by weight saline solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Absorbent Nonwoven Fabric and its production Technical FieldThis invention relates to a wet-laid nonwoven fabric useful in absorbent products such as diapers, incontinence pads, sanitary napkins and tampons and in wiping materials for mopping up spills of aqueous fluids. A wet-laid nonwoven fabric is a fabric comprising fibres which have been deposited from an aqueous suspension of fibres.Background ArtEP-A-437816 discloses a nonwoven wet-laid superabsorbent material produced by the process of blending superabsorbent polymer particles with a liquid to form a slurry, mixing fibres with that slurry, filtering that slurry/fibre mixture to remove a portion of the liquid and drying the superabsorbent slurry/fibre mixture to form a nonwoven wet-laid superabsorbent material.EP-A-359615 discloses a method for the manufacture of a superabsorbent fibrous structure in which a dry solid absorbent is applied directly to a wet-laid web of cellulosic fibres prior to drying the wet web.EP-A-273075 discloses a high water-absorbency paper made by sheeting a mixture of wood pulp fibre, water-soluble resin and high water-absorbency resin.Absorbent products such as diapers which include particles of a superabsorbent polymer such as crosslinked sodium polyacrylate disposed between layers of wood pulp are known for example from EP-A-257951.Disclosure of inventionA wet-laid nonwoven fabric according to the invention comprises a blend of 1 to 50% by weight of fibres of a 

 water-swellable water-insoluble superabsorbent polymer and 99 to 50% by weight of less absorbent fibres, for example fibres having an absorbency of less than 10 g/g measured by retention to centrifuging of a 0.9% by weight saline solution.In a process according to the invention for the production of a wet-laid nonwoven fabric, fibres of a water- swellable water-insoluble superabsorbent polymer and less absorbent fibres, for example fibres having an absorbency of less than 10 g/g as measured above, are slurried together in water, the slurry is deposited as a layer on a foraminous support so that part of the water drains from the layer of slurry on the support, and the resulting fibrous layer is dried to form the nonwoven fabric.The use of fibres of the water-swellable water- insoluble superabsorbent polymer, rather than the same polymer in particulate form, has significant advantages in many respects. The superabsorbent polymer fibres are more securely retained both during formation of the wet-laid nonwoven fabric and when the fabric is in use as an

CLAIMS
1. A wet-laid nonwoven fabric comprising a blend of 1 to 50% by weight of fibres of a water-swellable water-insoluble superabsorbent polymer and 99 to 50% by weight of less absorbent fibres having an absorbency of less than lOg/g measured by retention to centrifuging of a 0.9% by weight saline solution.
2. A fabric according to claim 1, wherein the superabsorbent polymer is a crosslinked copolymer of 50 to 95% by weight ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomer and 5 to 50% by weight copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer.
3. A fabric according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the less absorbent fibres comprise fibres of length 1 to 10mm.
4. A fabric according to claim 3, wherein the less absorbent fibres comprise wood pulp fibres.
5. A fabric according to claim 3, wherein the less absorbent fibres comprise polypropylene or polyethylene fibrils.
6. A fabric according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the less absorbent fibres comprise textile fibres of length 10 to 100mm.
7. A fabric according to claim 6, wherein the less absorbent fibres of length 10 to 100mm are cellulosic fibres or polyester, polyamide, acrylic, polypropylene or polyethylene fibres.
8. A fabric according to any of claims 1 to 7, comprising a blend of 5 to 20% by weight of the superabsorbent polymer fibres and 95 to 80% by weight of the less absorbent fibres. 


 9. A process for the production of a wet-laid nonwoven fabric, characterised in that fibres of a water-swellable water-insoluble superabsorbent polymer and less absorbent fibres having an absorbency of less than lOg/g, measured by retention to centrifuging of a 0.9% by weight saline solution, are slurried together in water, the slurry is deposited as a layer on a foraminous support so that part of the water drains from the layer of slurry on the support, and the resulting fibrous layer is dried to form the nonwoven fabric.
10. A process according to claim 9, wherein the proportion of superabsorbent fibres to less absorbent fibres is from 1:2 to 1:50 by weight.
11. A process according to claim 9 or claim 10, wherein the total fibre content of the slurry as it is deposited on the foraminous support is from 0.1 to 50 grams per litre.
12. A process according to any of claims 9 to 11, wherein the superabsorbent polymer fibres are slurried in a water- miscible organic liquid in which they do not swell and the resulting slurry is mixed with a slurry of the less absorbent fibres in water.
13. A process according to any of claims 9 to 11, wherein the superabsorbent polymer fibres are added as dry fibres to a slurry of the less absorbent fibres in water.
