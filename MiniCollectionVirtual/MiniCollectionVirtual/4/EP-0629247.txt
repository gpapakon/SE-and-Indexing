<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a knit fabric
made with non-elastic yarn and a minor weight fraction of
elastic combination yarns. More particularly, the
invention concerns such a knit fabric in which the
combination yarn has an elastic elongation of 10% to 70%
and provides improved fabrication, shape-retention and
appearance to fabric knit therewith.Knit fabrics which contain non-elastic textile
yarns and a minor fraction of elastic combination yarns
are known. Such fabrics are used for sweaters, socks and
the like. For example, Strauss et al, U.S. Patent
5,050,406, discloses a knit fabric that comprises 30%
core-spun combination yarn,in which the yarn is 90% cotton
and 10% spandex. Also, Muller et al, U.S. Patent
3,392,552, describes a knit fabric, in which at least 20%
of the ends are of elastic yarn plied with inelastic yarn.Various types of elastic combination yarns are
known, such as covered, core-spun, plied, core-effect,
plaited, air-jet-entangled and like yarns. In such yarns,
elastic filaments are combined with non-elastic textile
yarns by known techniques. In the manufacture of some
combination yarns, the elastomeric components are
stretched during combination with inelastic yarn. For
example, Strachan, U.S. Patent 3,940,917, discloses a
spandex yarn being stretched at least 100%, usually 250 to
500%, during air-jet entanglement with inelastic
filaments, and Miyasaka, Japanese Patent Application 38-50045,
discloses an elastic yarn being stretched 50%
during a similar entanglement procedure.Although non-elastic textile yarns and elastic
combination yarns have been used together in various knit
fabrics, the utility of such fabrics in manufactured
garments such as sweaters, socks, and the like, has been 
somewhat limited. Incorporation of elastic combination
yarns into such fabrics often resulted in undesirable
"working loss" (i.e., area contraction) in the fabrics
immediately after the fabric was removed from the knitting
machine on which the fabric was made. However, various
garments knit from natural fibers, such as cotton and
wool, without any elastic yarns in the fabric, often
suffer problems of shape distortion during finishing,
cleaning and storage.An object of this invention is to provide an
improved knit fabric in which the problems of working loss
and shape distortion are significantly decreased.The present invention provides an improved knit
fabric, particularly suited for the manufacture of
sweaters, socks, skirts, dresses and the like. The knit
fabric is of a known type that
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A weft knit or circular knit fabric,
comprising inelastic yarn and elastic combination yarn,

wherein the elastic combination yarn comprises in the range
of 97.5 to 65 weight percent inelastic fiber and 2.5 to 35

weight percent elastic fiber characterized in that the elastic
combination yarn has an elastic stretch in the range of

10 to 70%. 
A fabric of claim 1 wherein the elastic fiber is
spandex.
A fabric in accordance with claim 2, particularly suited for use as a sweater fabric,
wherein the fabric is a weft-knit fabric, the elastic

combination yarn amounts to in the range of 2.5 to 5% of the
total weight of the fabric and the spandex content of the

fabric is in the range of 0.2 to 0.6%.
A fabric in accordance with claim 2, particularly suited for use as a sock fabric, wherein
the fabric is a circular-knit fabric, the elastic combination

yarn amounts to in the range of 10 to 40% of the total weight
of the fabric and the spandex content of the fabric is in the

range of 1 to 3.5%.
A process for knitting a fabric comprising

feeding an elastic combination yarn and conventional
textile fiber yarn to a weft knitting or circular knitting

machine, the elastic combination yarn having an elastic
stretch in the range of 10 to 70 percent and comprising in the

range of 97.5 to 65 weight percent inelastic fiber and 2.5 to
35 weight percent elastic fiber,
maintaining about equal tension on the elastic
combination yarn and the conventional textile yarn, and
adjusting the tension to be sufficient to fully extend
the combination yarn in the range of 10 to 70 percent.
