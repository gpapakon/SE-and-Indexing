<ABSTRACT>
Distilling tube apparatus (11) for converting salt 
water such as sea water into fresh water is provided. The 

apparatus includes a first tube (21) through which a feed 
stream of heated salt water (12) is caused to flow, the 

first tube being constructed of a porous material which is 
both water-vapor permeable and liquid water impermeable, 

which tube allows water vapor to permeate through its walls 
thereof when heated salt water flows therethrough, the 

vapor then condensing outside of the first tube upon 
cooling of the vapor thereat. This first tube (21) is 

preferably constructed of porous, expended 
polytetrafluoroethylene. A second tube (22) oriented in 

generally parallel relationship and in close proximity to 
the first tube is provided through which cooling water (17) 

is caused to flow. The cooling water is maintained at a 
temperature lower than that of the heated salt water, 

thereby resulting in a lowering of the temperature of the 
surroundings of the second tube and providing an enhanced 

driving force for distillation of the salt water. A third 
housing tube (23) is provided which houses both the first 

tube (21) and the second tube (22) within its interior. 
This housing tube has a plurality of spaced apart openings 

(24) in the wall thereof to permit fresh water which has 
condensed externally to the first tube and within the 

housing tube to flow through these openings and thence 
outwardly of the distilling tube apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fresh water generator for 
producing fresh water from salt water, brackish water or otherwise 
raw or nonfresh water. Specifically, fresh water can be produced 
from sea water for use as irrigation water. More specifically, 
distilling tube apparatus is provided involving the use of a vapor-permeable 
and water impermeable material that is suitable for use 
in such fresh water generators. The conversion of sea water into fresh water for use as 
irrigation water has been studied for the greening of deserts or 
the cultivation of agricultural crops in arid regions, and the use 
of fresh water generators such as those depicted in Figures 5 and 
6 have been proposed for irrigation facilities. These are systems 
in which a single distilling tube 1, formed using a vapor-permeable 
membrane having the physical property of liquid water 
impermeability but allowing water vapor to permeate, is buried in 
the ground in regions that are to be irrigated. Sea water 2 is 
stored in a tank 3 where it is typically heated to about 50 degrees 
C by a solar collector 4, for example, and the heated sea water 2 
is fed under pressure by a pump 5 and circulated to the distilling 
tube 1. In this fresh water generator, simply heating the sea 
water 2 and feeding it under pressure to the distilling tube 1 
allows the sea water 2 to be converted to vapor as a result of the 
difference between the temperature of the heated sea water itself 
and the temperature in the surrounding ground. The vapor permeates  
 
the material comprising the distilling tube 1 and is exuded into 
the ground, where it is immediately cooled and condensed, thus 
watering the ground in the form of distilled water, that is, fresh 
water. Fresh water is thus naturally generated by the 
afroementioned distilling tube 1 and immediately supplied into the 
ground. The salt component and other components in the sea water 
2 cannot permeate the distilling tube 1 and are thus gradually 
concentrated and collected in tank 3. Because the raw water 2 is heated to about 50 degrees C and 
fed under pressure to the distilling tube 1 in the aforementioned 
fresh water generator, the temperature in the ground surrounding 
the distilling tube 1 gradually increases to nearly the same 
temperature as the feed water 2, leading to concerns over the 
deleterious heating effects on the roots of the crops as well as 
the other drawback that adequate distillation efficiency (driving 
force resulting from actual temperature difference) is not 
nece
