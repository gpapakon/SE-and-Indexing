<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent composite (44) suitable for use in a disposable 
absorbent garment, includes means (50) for containing a 

superabsorbent material and a superabsorbent material (58) 

contained by said containment means. The superabsorbent 
material has a Pressure Absorbency Index of at least 100 and 

a 16-hour extractable level of less than 13 weight percent or 
a Pressure Absorbency Index of at least 100 and a Vortex Time 

of less than about 45 seconds; or a Pressure Absorbency Index 
of at least 110. The superabsorbent material is present in 

said containment means in an amount of from about 30 to about 
100 weight percent based on total weight of the containment 

means and the superabsorbent material. Further disclosed is 
a disposable absorbent garment including an outer cover, a 

body-side liner, and an absorbent composite (44) such as that 
described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
Absorbent composites suitable for use in disposable absorbent
garments such as diapers, adult incontinent products, and the
like, are known. Such absorbent composites are described,
for example, in U.S. Patent 4,699,619 issued October 13,
1987, to Bernardin; U.S. Patent 4,798,603 issued January 17,
1989, to Meyer et al.; U.S. Patent 4,834,735 issued May 30,
1989, to Alemany et al.; U.S. Patent 5,147,343 issued
September 15, 1992, to Kellenberger; and U.S Patent
5,149,335 issued September 22, 1992, to Kellenberger et al.Generally, such absorbent composites comprise a means of
containing a high-absorbency material and a high-absorbency
material. Suitable means for containing the high-absorbency
material include fibrous matrixes, such as those formed from
air-laid cellulosic fibers or a coform material comprising
cellulosic fibers and meltblown polyolefin fibers. A wide
variety of high-absorbency materials (also known as
superabsorbent materials) are known to those skilled in the
art. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,076,663 issued
February 28, 1978, to Masuda et al.; 4,286,082 issued August
25, 1981, to Tsubakimoto et al.; 4,062,817 issued December
13, 1977, to Westerman; and 4,340,706 issued July 20, 1982,
to Obayashi et al.Many known absorbent composites comprising a high-absorbency
material employ the high-absorbency material in relatively
low concentrations. That is, many of the absorbent
composites comprise airlaid cellulosic fibers and less than
about 20 weight percent of a high-absorbency material. This
is due to several factors.Many high-absorbency materials are unable to absorb a liquid
at the rate at which the liquid is applied to the absorbent
composites during use. Accordingly, a relatively high
concentration of fibrous material is desirable to temporarily
hold the liquid until the high-absorbency material can absorb 
it. Further, the fibers serve to separate the particles of
high-absorbency material so that gel-blocking does not occur.
Gel-blocking refers to the situation wherein particles of
high-absorbency material deform during swelling and block the
interstitial spaces between the particles, or between the
particles and the fibers, thus preventing the flow of liquid
through the interstitial spaces.U.S. Patent 5,147,343 issued September 15, 1992, to
Kellenberger describes an absorbent composite adapted to
avoid the problem of gel-blocking. U.S. 5,147,343 describes
the use of a superabsorbent material which can absorb at
least 27 milliliters of a 0.9 weight percent aqueous sodium
chlorid
