<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for 
the live scanning of fingerprint images and more 
particularly to a portable apparatus for the scanning 
and capture of fingerprint images and the wireless 
transmission of said images to a central location for 
identity verification. Over the years, the most commonly used 
techniques for both identity verification and the 
identification of potential crime suspects have been the 
use of fingerprints and photographs or "mug shots". Originally, fingerprinting was done by inking a 
suspect's finger and applying the inked finger to paper. 
As can be readily understood, fingerprint information in 
this form was difficult to use. Making a fingerprint 
match was an extremely time-consuming task. Digital 
technology significantly advanced the art of 
fingerprinting. Inked images could be scanned, the 
image digitalized and recorded in a manner that could 
later be searched in a reasonably expeditious manner by 
computer. Problems arose, however, due to the quality 
of inked images. Over- and under-inking resulted in 
blurred or vague images, thus rendering the digitalized 
information useless. Further, the process of scanning 
an inked image was relatively time consuming. These and other problems led to "live 
scanning". According to live scanning techniques, the 
fingerprint of a suspect is scanned directly from the 
suspect's finger, as opposed to being scanned from an 
inked image of the print. More specifically, live scans 
are those procedures which capture fingerprint ridge 
detail in a manner which allows for the immediate 
processing of the fingerprint image with a computer.  
 
Original work in the field dates back to original 
patents filed in 1964 concerning techniques used to 
capture high contrast images of fingerprint for 
photographic or digital capture of fingerprints. Since their introduction, live scans have 
become an important tool for law-enforcement. The live 
scan has the potential to overcome inherent weaknesses 
in the ink capture of fingerprints and provide immediate 
transmission of fingerprint images; and allow for image 
enhancement if necessary. These characteristics provide law-enforcement 
with the ability to improve the quality of the 
fingerprint data base, thereby improving the likelihood 
that identifications can be made either from latent 
fingerprints or from identity verification checks. In 
addition, live scan fingerprints are easily adaptable to 
computerized storage and processing techniques, 
increasing cooperation and

comprising the steps of:  

 

a) providing a portable personal identification unit 
(10) which can be used for field identification of a 

person, wherein the portable unit (10) comprises: 

first, video camera means (20) for recording a mug 
shot image of the person to be identified; 
fingerprint capture means (14) for propagating 
a fingerprint image; 
second camera means (18) for recording the 
propagated fingerprint image; 
a transmitter (30); and 
terminal means (28), connected to said 
transmitter and to said first and second camera 

means, for controlling capture and transmission of 
images by said first and second camera means; 
b) carrying the unit (10) to a first location; 
c) recording, with the first camera means (20), a 
mug shot image of the person being identified; 
d) capturing, with the second camera means (18), a 
fingerprint image representative of a fingerprint 

pattern of one of the person's fingers; 
e) selecting, via the terminal means, an image to be 
transmitted from a group of images including the mug 

shot image and the fingerprint image; and 
f) transmitting the selected image to a second 
location. 
The method of verifying the identity according to 
claim 9, wherein the method further comprises the step  

 
of comparing the transmitted fingerprint images to 

stored fingerprint images in an automated fingerprint 
identification system.
