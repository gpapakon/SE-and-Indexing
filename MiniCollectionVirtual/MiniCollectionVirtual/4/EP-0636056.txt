<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a chain magazine designed to hold the tools (8) of machining devices, the magazine comprising a continuous chain fitted with holders for the machining tools (8) and driven by at least two sprockets and guided by guide elements up to the point of contact with the pitch diameter of the drive or return sprocket. The chain magazine further comprises chain links (9) consisting of a connecting bar (10) and, joined to the bar, two tubular sleeve elements (11, 12) of different diameters which form the flexible couplings between the links. The tubular sleeve elements (11, 12) encircle each other with a small motion clearance, and tool holders are located in them coaxial to the coupling axis (Z). Each of the tubular sleeve elements (11, 12) has shaft-like zones (21, 22) with parallel surfaces spaced a certain distance apart and facing the central axis (19) of each tool holder. The shaft-like zones (21, 22) form, in the insertion or removal position of the chain coupling, an open insertion or removal route (23). The invention can call, in addition, for the outer sleeve element (12), which encircles the smaller-diameter inner sleeve element (11), to have an opening, extending along part of its circumference, of the same width as the connecting bar (10).

Chain magazine for holding machining tools (8) of machining 
equipment, especially machine tools, comprising 

an endless chain provided with holding fixtures for machining 
tools (8), driven by at least two chain wheels (3) and conducted 

by guiding elements up to the reference diameters of the driving 
or idle chain wheels,
 
characterized by 


a) chain links (9), each comprising a bridge part (10) and 
two bushes (11, 12) of different diameter forming the 

chain joints (13) which, atboth ends,have been connected 
to this bridge part, 
b) holding fixtures for machining tools (8) which have been 
arranged coaxially to the joint axes (Z) within the bushes 

(11, 12) enclosing each other with a light motional play, 
as well as 
c) pit-like cutouts (21, 22) with spaced parallel faces, 
adjusted to the centre axes (19) of the holding fixtures,  

 
to be found in each bush (11, 12) and forming an open 

load or unload groove (23) in the respective feed or 
removal position of the chain joint (13). 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the respective (outside) bush (12) enclosing the 

(inside) bush (11) of a smaller diameter shows, with a certain 
sector (14) of its periphery, a recess corresponding to 

the thickness (h) of the bridge part (10). 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the tooth spaces (4) of the chain wheel (3) will support 

the jointing (outside) bushes (12) of greater diameter. 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the chain wheels (3) consist of two spaced chain 

wheel disks (3, 30) which allow the engagement of the free 
(outside) bushes (12) of greater diameter, arranged at both 

sides, and between these disks, the bridge parts (10) of the 
chain (2) will be running. 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the jointing bushes (11, 12) engaging the tooth spaces 

(4) between the chain wheel teeth (5) have been linked to 
the bridge part (10) to form a single component.  

 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the jointing bushes (12) engaging the tooth spaces 

(4) between the chain wheel teeth (5), have been linked, one to 
the other, by a bridge part comprising two spaced straps. 
Chain magazine according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the two straps of the bridge part of the chain links 

(9) enclose the one-disk chain wheel (3) at both sides. 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the bridge parts (10) have been provided with 

guide rollers. 
Chain magazine according to claim 2, characterized in 
that each (larger) outside bush (12) encircling the inside 

bush of smaller diameter (11), has been provided with running 
rollers which will be received by the tooth spaces (4) of the 

chain wheels (3). 
Chain magazine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the holding fixtures for machining tools have been 

fitted with clamping elements (6) allowing the detachable fixing 
of the machining tools (8).
