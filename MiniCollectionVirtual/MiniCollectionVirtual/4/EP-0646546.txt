<ABSTRACT>
A basic metal salt expressed by the general formula given below and an alkaline water-soluble 
lithium 

compound are reacted in an aqueous medium at a molar ratio of Li/M²⁺ of from 0.3 to 1.3: M²⁺(OH)
2-nx
(A
n-1
)
x
m 
H₂O 

where M²⁺ is at least one member selected from Ni²⁺, Co²⁺ and Mn²⁺, A
n-1
 
is an anion having n valence (n = 1 to 3) 

such as NO₃⁻, Cl⁻, CH₃COO⁻, and CO₃²⁻, and x and m are positive numbers satisfying the relation 0.03 ≦ x ≦ 0.3 and 0 
≦ m ≦ 2. The resulting slurry is dried and is then sintered at not lower than about 500 °C in an oxidizing atmosphere. 

This invention can mass-produce industrially LiM³⁺O₂ or LiMn₂O₄ having high purity and high crystallinity. LiNi³⁺O₂ 
thus produced exhibits excellent charge/discharge characteristics as a positive pole active material of a secondary cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process
for producing a compound of the formula LiM3+O2 (wherein
M3+ is Ni3+ or/and Co3+) or LiMn2O4 useful as a
material of a positive electrode of a rechargeable
secondary battery, and further relates to LiNi3+O2 for
use in a positive electrode of a secondary battery
which is obtained by the above process.LiCoO2 (lithium cobaltate) is now being widely
used as an active material of a positive electrode of a
secondary battery. LiCoO2 is being produced by a
complicated and inefficient process comprising performing
dry or wet mixing of powdery Li2CO3 and powdery
CoCO3, preliminarily firing the mixture, carrying out
pulverization and mixing of the preliminarily fired
mixture and finally firing the resultant mixture as
described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Specification No. 294373/1989. In this process, not 
only is producing a LiCoO2 having a uniform composition
difficult but also impurities are liable to occur as
by-products, so that there has been a limitation in
obtaining an active material having high charge and
discharge characteristics. Moreover, cobalt output is
small from the viewpoint of natural resources, and it
is believed that meeting an increased demand would be
difficult in the future.In such circumstances, in place of the above
CoCO3, it has been attempted in recent years to treat
NiCO3 or MnCO3 which is less expensive and more abundant
in reserves, by the above method in order to use
the same as an active material of a secondary battery.
However, the LiNiO2 and LiMn2O4 thus produced more
clearly have the problems described above with respect
to LiCoO2, with the result that the resultant products
are so poor in purity that there is none which can be
put into practical use.On the other hand, Dyer et al developed another
process for synthesizing LiNiO2, which was disclosed in
Journal of American Chemical Society 76, 1499 (1954).
This synthetic process is illustrated in Fig. 4, in
which use is made of a double-pipe apparatus comprising
an outer nickel pipe 1 and, inserted therein, an inner
nickel pipe 2. The inner pipe 2 has its inserted tip 
portion opened thereby to have a blowoff aperture 3. A
predetermined amount, e.g., 50 g, of powdery LiOH 4 is
filled in the outer pipe 1. While the overall double-pipe
apparatus is heated at about 800 °C thereby to
melt the LiOH, oxygen is fed into the inner pipe 2 and
blown out from the blowoff aperture 3 for 24 hours.
Thus, LiNiO2 mass 5 covered with a LiOH film is formed
on the inner surface of the
