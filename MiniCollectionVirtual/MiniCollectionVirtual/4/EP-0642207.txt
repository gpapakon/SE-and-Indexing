Motor-gearbox unit comprising:

a circular motor (1) whose drive shaft (2) is coupled
to a drive gear (3) to transmit rotational movement of the

drive shaft to an output gear (4) through the intermediary of
an intermediate gear (5) coupled to said drive gear and to

said output gear,
first and second bearing assemblies (6, 7) disposed on
the drive shaft on respective sides of the circular motor,
a motor flange (8) disposed around said circular motor
and supporting said first bearing assembly, and
a gearbox flange (9) disposed around said drive and
output gears and said intermediate gear,
said first and second bearing assemblies (6, 7) being
disposed on respective sides of the circular motor (1) and the

drive gear (3),
said second bearing assembly (7) being supported by
said gearbox flange (9), and
said gearbox flange being cooled by forced
ventilation,

   characterised in that said gearbox flange is cooled by
part of the forced ventilation of said motor flange.
Motor-gearbox unit according to claim 1 wherein its
upper part is cooled by forced ventilation and its lower part

is cooled by natural ventilation.
Motor-gearbox unit according to claim 2 comprising
cooling fins in the lower part of said gearbox flange.
Motor-gearbox unit according to claim 2 or claim 3
comprising a first ventilation cover (10) on the upper part of

said gearbox flange and a second ventilation cover (11) on the
upper part of said motor flange.
Motor-gearbox unit according to any one of claims 1
to 4 comprising a front seal held between the contacting

surfaces of said motor and gearbox flanges.
