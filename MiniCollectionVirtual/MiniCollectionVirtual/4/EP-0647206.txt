<ABSTRACT>
A dual-impregnated activated carbon composition includes activated carbon impregnated with a Group 6-12 metal salt and a Group 1 metal carbonate salt, where the molar ratio on the activated carbon of the Group 1 metal to the Group 6-12 metal is 1 or greater. The dual-impregnated activated carbon composition is particularly suitable for filtering gaseous contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to chemically-treated activated carbon that has 
been impregnated with a Group 6-12 metal salt and a Group 1 metal carbonate 
salt. Activated carbon has been commonly used as a sorbent for removing 
gaseous contaminants from air. In many known activated carbon 
compositions, the activated carbon is impregnated with a metal or metal salt, 
which assists in removing a gaseous contaminant from the air. For example, 
it has been disclosed that hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can be removed from air 
by impregnating an activated carbon cloth with a metal carbonate salt that 
contains divalent cations of manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc (see 
Alder et al., The Adsorption of Hydrogen Cyanide by Activated Carbon Cloth, 
Carbon, v. 26, n. 5, pp. 701-711, 713-721 (1988); see also UK Patent 
Application GB 2,187,725). It also has been disclosed that activated carbon 
can be (i) treated with a salt that has a coefficient of solubility greater than 
1x10-2 grams per gram of water (for example, a nitrate, sulfate, tartrate, 
acetate, or chloride salts that contain cations of zinc, cadmium, copper, 
nickel, silver, cobalt, or barium), (ii) dried, (iii) treated with a metal salt that 
can be sodium or potassium carbonate, vanadate, chromate, tungstenate, 
permanganate, and molybdenate, and (iv) then washed thoroughly with excess 
water (see Czechoslovakian Patent 175,003). This invention provides a dual-impregnated activated carbon 
composition that is capable of removing gaseous contaminants from a fluid 
such as air. The composition comprises activated carbon impregnated with 
at least one first metal salt and at least one second metal salt. The first metal 
salt(s) contains a metal from Groups 6-12 of the periodic table (using the new 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) notation issued 
by the Commission on the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry in 1988). 
The second metal salt is a metal carbonate salt that contains a Group 1 metal. 
The molar ratio on the activated carbon of the metal(s) of the second metal 
salt(s) to the metal(s) of the first metal salt(s) is about 1 or greater.  
 This invention also provides a method of making a composition capable 
of removing gaseous contaminants from a fluid. The method comprises: 
(a) impregnating activated carbon with at least one first metal salt 
that contains a metal from Groups 6-12; and (b) impregnating the activated carbon with at least one second metal 
salt that is a metal carbonate that contains a Group 1 metal;
