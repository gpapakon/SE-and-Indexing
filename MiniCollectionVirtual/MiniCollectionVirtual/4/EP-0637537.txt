<ABSTRACT>
A steering device is disclosed which is compact, 
has a low load and which cannot be moved by a force 

from wheels. The steering device comprises a brushless 
electric motor (12) which is mounted onboard a vehicle 

and having a hollow rotating shaft (27) and including 
electric coils (44) connected in three-phase, two-circuits; 

a trapezoidal female thread (27sf) integral and concentric 
with the hollow rotating shaft; an operating shaft (25) 

extending through the hollow rotating shaft (27) in its 
axial direction for driving wheels for steering purpose; 

a trapezoidal male thread (26sm) integral and concentric 
with the operating shaft and threadably engaged with the 

trapezoidal female thread; and motor drivers (5, 6) for 
energizing the brushless electric motor (12) for rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a steering apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1. In particular it
relates to a steering apparatus, in
which wheels are steered by the power from an electric
motor, and in particular, while not intended to be limited
thereto, to an automatic steering mechanism of a so-called
four wheel steering system for automobile in which auxiliary
steering wheels (rear wheels) are driven by the power from
an electric motor for steering purpose in association with
the steering of main steering wheels (front wheels) of
a vehicle.In a typical arrangement of a steering apparatus
of the kind described, a rotating power from an electric
motor is transmitted, with a speed reduction through worm
and wheel, to a pinion, which in turn linearly drives an
output rack or operating shaft in order to drive wheels for
steering purpose (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Utility
Model Application No. 176,578/1989 or Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 164,382/1991). A high reduction
ratio through the worm and wheel is utilized in an attempt
to develop a driving force of a greater magnitude from
an electric motor of a relatively low power level, but
because the power is transmitted through the worm and
wheel substantially through a sliding contact, soft
metals such as phosphor bronze, aluminum bronze or the
like are used for the wheels in order to prevent brazure. 
This generally results in a low level of fatigue strength
of the tooth surface, requiring extreme cares to be
exercised in maintaining lubrication requirements and
the tooth surface and assembly accuracy. To withstand
greater forces, it is also necessary to provide an
increased area of contact between the worm and wheel,
by increasing the depth of meshing engagement therebetween
so that the gear on the wheel wraps the worm. This
results in a reduction in the power transmitting efficiency,
which means that an electric motor of a greater power and
a greater size is required. Since a steering apparatus
is disposed between the pair of rear wheels so as to
extend in the lateral direction of a vehicle, it follows
that the space in which the steering apparatus is disposed
is generally open in the lateral direction, but is
restricted in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle.
Accordingly, the size of the steering apparatus as viewed
in the fore-and-aft direction of the vehicle must be
reduced. From such point of view, there is proposed
a steering apparatus in which a hypoid gear is fixedly
mounted on an output pinion which meshes with an
