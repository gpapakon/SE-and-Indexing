<CLAIMS>
Process for the preparation of alkylaluminoxanes
immobilized on inert support materials, characterized in

that water is metered into solutions of alkylaluminium
compounds in hydrocarbons in a static mixer and the

resulting alkylaluminoxanes present in the form of
dispersions are fixed on inert support materials.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
dispersions of methylaluminoxanes in aromatic hydrocarbons

are used.
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that water and alkylaluminium compounds are used in a

molar ratio of 0.8-1.3, preferably 0.9-1.2.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the support material used is SiO
2
 having a water content

<
 5, preferably 
<
 3, % by weight.
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that 5-40, preferably 10-25, % by weight of aluminium is

fixed on the support material in the form of aluminoxanes.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the support material is metered into the dispersion.
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the support material is already present in the

mixture during the preparation of the dispersion.
Cocatalyst comprising alkylaluminoxanes immobilized
on inert support materials, prepared by one of the

processes according to Claims 1 to 7.
