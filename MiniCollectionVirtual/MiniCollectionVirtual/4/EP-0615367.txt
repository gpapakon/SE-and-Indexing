<ABSTRACT>
A digital cross-connection apparatus 
for connecting first and second 

communication networks (STM-N) 
which have respectively a plurality of 

first and second data channels, and have 
multiplexed information data and communication 

monitoring data of the channels. 
The apparatus is provided with 

add/drop units (TTF, TSAF, LCS) and 
a digital switch matrix (LPX). The add/drop 

unit (TTF, TSAF, LCS) is connected 
to the first network (STM-N), and 

can extract selectively the data from the 
first data channel. The output terminals 

of the digital switch matrix are connected 
to the second network (STM-N). The 

input terminals of the digital switch matrix 
are connected to the add/drop unit 

(TTF, TSAF, LCS) so as to receive the 
extracted data including the management 

data sent from the first network. 
Therefore, the management data can 

reach the second network via the digital 
switch matrix (LPX), and thereby, the 

monitoring of end-to-end paths between 
the networks are promoted. The apparatus is used advantageously in connecting two optical ring networks with each other. For 

example, when the apparatus is used to connect synchronous digital hierarchy networks, maintained are the continuities of the 
paths extending from the nodes of the first network to the nodes of the second network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interconnecting
communications networks, and in particular the present
invention relates to digital cross connect equipment.The International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT) has established a set of
recommendations describing the methodology for a
recently-proposed digital transport network called
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH).These recommendations cover the transport frame
structure, multiplexing methods, basic outlines of the
equipment functionality and the means of managing this
equipment. The directly relevant recommendations are:
G.707, G.708, G.709, G781, G.782, G.783, G.784, G.773,
G.sdx1, G.sdx2, G.sdx3, G.snal, G.sna2, G.81s, and G.82j.
Furthermore, the recommendations are backward compatible
with the existing PDH recommendations of G.702, and
G.703, etc.The CCITT recommendations are concerned with
functionality and are not specific to particular
equipment implementation strategies. Therefore it is
possible to combine several specific functional blocks to
form a particular equipment type.The present invention can provide equipment
conforming to the relevant standards set out in the
recommendations, and can assist in arriving at integrated
system solutions to equipment design problems in
particular SDH applications.In order to allow items of communications equipment
on different networks such as two optical ring networks
to communicate with one another, conventionally a Digital
Cross Connect element (DXC) is provided. This DXC is
essentially a digital switching matrix with an operation 
interface for setting up relatively static connection
between input and output signals or channels.For example, "An Asynchronous DS3 Cross-Connect
System with Add/Drop Capability", IEEE Global
Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition, Florida,
USA, November 23 - December 1, 1988, describes digital
cross-connection apparatus, suitable for
interconnecting first and second communications paths
each having a plurality of data channels, information
data and communications management data of the channels
in each path being multiplexed together therein, which
apparatus comprises: cross-connect switching means
having a first-path input which, when the apparatus is
in use, is connected operatively to the said first path
for receiving the data of a preselected through channel
of the first path and also having a second-path output
which, when the apparatus is in use, is connected
operatively to the said second path, the cross-connect
switching means being
