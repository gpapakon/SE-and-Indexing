<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the subject matter of the claims.Mammalian bone tissue is known to contain one or
more proteinaceous materials, presumably active during
growth and natural bone healing, which can induce a
developmental cascade of cellular events resulting in
endochondral bone formation. This active factor (or
factors) has variously been referred to in the
literature as bone morphogenetic or morphogenic
protein, bone inductive protein, osteogenic protein,
osteogenin, or osteoinductive protein.The developmental cascade of bone differentiation
consists of recruitment of mesenchymal cells,
proliferation of progenitor cells, calcification of
cartilage, vascular invasion, bone formation,
remodeling, and finally marrow differentiation (Reddi
(1981) Collagen Rel.Res.1:209-226).Though the precise mechanisms underlying these
phenotypic transformations are unclear, it has been
shown that the natural endochondral bone
differentiation activity of bone matrix can be
dissociatively extracted and reconstituted with 
inactive residual collagenous matrix to restore full
bone induction activity (Sampath and Reddi, (1981)
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA78:7599-7603). This
provides an experimental method for assaying protein
extracts for their ability to induce endochondral bone
in vivo. Several species of mammals produce closely
related protein as demonstrated by cross species
implant experiments (Sampath and Reddi (1983) Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA80:6591-6595).The potential utility of these proteins has been
recognized widely. It is contemplated that the
availability of the protein would revolutionize
orthopedic medicine, certain types of plastic surgery,
and various periodontal and craniofacial reconstructive
procedures.The observed properties of these protein fractions
have induced an intense research effort in various
laboratories directed to isolating and identifying the
pure factor or factors responsible for osteogenic
activity. The current state of the art of purification
of osteogenic protein from mammalian bone is disclosed
by Sampath et al. ((1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
84: 7109-7113). Urist et al. (1984) Proc. Soc. Exp.
Biol. Med.173: 194-199 disclose a human osteogenic
protein fraction which was extracted from demineralized
cortical bone by means of a calcium chloride-urea
inorganic-organic solvent mixture, and retrieved by
differential precipitation in guanidine-hydrochloride
and preparative gel electrophoresis. The authors
report that the protein fraction has an amino acid
composition of an acidic
