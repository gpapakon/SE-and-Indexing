<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fastening device for the housing of a shut-off fitting for a buried or exposed supply line (1). The shut-off fitting, preferably a shut-off valve, in particular for gas lines, can be located in a housing (2) which exhibits two connection studs (3) for the connections of the pipes of the supply line (1). The object of the invention is to provide an effective and universal possibility for fastening the housing (2) of a shut-off fitting, on and by means of which simple fastening is possible, which fastening permits large torques to be absorbed. The invention consists in the fact that the housing (2) exhibits at least one strap (9) which is provided with at least one hole (4) through which there is plugged a screw (6) which is mounted on an anchor (7) or a foundation (10). The struts (5) provided with a hole (4) can, in a simple manner and without any great amount of extra work, be produced in one piece with the housing (2). In this arrangement, said struts (5) provide a very firm grip when they are connected, in particular by screws (6) or bolts, to an anchor (7) or a foundation (10).
