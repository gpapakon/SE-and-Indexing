<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle driver restraint air bag (10), including 
releasable stitching (24, 26, 28, 30) for controlled 

deployment, comprises a circular front panel (12) and a 
circular rear panel which are joined at their peripheries 

(16). A central inlet opening in the rear panel is flanked 
by parallel lines of releasable stitching (24, 26, 28, 30) 

to form a central region (32) and lateral lobes (34, 36). 
Interruptions (38, 40) of the stitching adjacent the inlet 

opening produce passageways for direct flow of inflation 
gas to the lateral lobes (34, 36). The air bag (10) is 

folded in accordian folds perpendicular to the stitch 
lines, and thereafter in packing folds perpendicular to the 

accordian folds. During the inflation, outward deployment 
of the front panel is retarded by the stitching and the 

lateral lobes inflate to create a broad frontal surface. 
The stitches (24, 26, 28, 30) release prior to full 

inflation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein refers to a vehicle air bag, and 
more particularly to a driver's side vehicle air bag adapted to 
deploy in a controlled manner. Many modern vehicles incorporate one or more inflatable 
air bags for the protection of occupants in the event of a 
crash. The air bags are mounted in a folded, compact condition 
in conjunction with a gas generator, and upon sensing of a 
vehicle crash, the gas generator produces inflation gas which 
rapidly deploys and inflates the air bag. The driver's side air bag is typically mounted in the 
hub of a steering wheel and deploys toward the driver as the 
driver experiences relative motion toward the wheel and deploying 
air bag. The thrust or main axis of deployment of the air bag 
is directly toward the driver, and the material of the air bag 
initially forms an elongated column, the end of which may strike 
the driver (sometimes in the face) occasionally resulting in 
abrasions. As the gas generator continues to provide inflation 
gasses, and the air bag then fills laterally to provide the 
desired broad cushion. The formation and travel of the initial 
elongated column of air bag material is in large part a result 
of inertia provided to the material of the air bag upon initial 
rapid deployment, and is not solely a function of inflation 
pressure within the air bag.  Driver's side air bags have been provided with internal 
tether straps to restrain the range of initial inertial 
deployment toward the driver. Two to four anchored tether straps 
have their ends secured to the front panel of the air bag to 
limit the extent of deployment of the front panel toward the 
driver. This tether strap system, although efficient in limiting 
the extent of deployment, has some drawbacks of its own. The 
tether straps add concentrated points of mass to the front panel 
and this additional mass in part exacerbates the problem in that 
more kinetic energy is developed and imparted to the driver if 
the air bag reaches the driver, with a consequent greater chance 
of injury. The tether straps also cause stress concentration at 
the attachment points, thereby requiring additional reinforcement 
to prevent failure of the air bag. Further, the tether straps 
add bulk and weight to the air bag module, when it is desirable 
to keep the module as light and compact as possible for mounting 
in the steering wheel hub. Accordingly, there is a need for better control in the 
deployment of a driver's side air bag while retaining simplicity 
and reliability in the

A vehicle air bag for inflation in the event

(34, 36), said stitching further deployed to provide a 

passageway (38, 40) for direct flow of inflation gas to 
each of the lateral lobes (34, 36) upon initial gas 

generation and consequent deployment of the air bag (10),

wherein the front and rear panels (12, 14) of the air bag 

are fabric having a denier range of 400-450, the releasable 
stitching (24, 26, 28, 30) utilizes nylon thread in the 

range of 2268-2835gm (80-100 ounces), and the stitches are
