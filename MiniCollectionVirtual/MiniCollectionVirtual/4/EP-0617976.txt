<ABSTRACT>
The device has a valve block (1) in which there are formed a breathing channel (2), an air channel (3) which opens transversely into the breathing channel, and an aerosol channel (4) which opens transversely into the breathing channel, and in which control valves (S1, S2, R) which are arranged in the valve block for control of the supply of air and aerosol through the channels and can be operated mechanically, electromagnetically or pneumatically. According to the invention, the device is characterised in that a flow figure (5) is provided in the breathing channel in the region of the openings of the air channel and the aerosol channel, in that the longitudinal axis of the air channel is laterally offset relative to the longitudinal axis of the breathing channel for generation of a tangential flow against the flow figure, and in that the longitudinal axis of the aerosol channel lies laterally relative to the longitudinal axis of the breathing channel for generation of a tangential flow against the flow figure.

Appliance for generating aerosol pulses with

one valve block (1) into which open

-- one breathing channel (2),
-- one air channel (3), opening transversely into the breathing channel (2), and
-- one aerosol channel (4), opening transversely into the breathing channel (2)

and
control valves (S1, S2, S3, R) which are arranged in the valve block (1) to control
the supply of air and of aerosol through channels (2, 3, 4) and can be actuated mechanically,

electromechanically or pneumatically,
characterized
 in that
a flow body (5) having a tapering section (5a) whose tip points in the direction of the
flow in the breathing channel (2) during an inhalation process is provided in the

breathing channel (2) in the region into which the air channel (3) and the aerosol
channel (4) open,
the position of the longitudinal axis (3a) of the air channel (3) is displaced laterally
relative to the longitudinal axis (2c) of the breathing channel (2) to generate a tangential

flow against the flow body (5), and
the position of the longitudinal axis (4a) of the aerosol channel (4) is displaced laterally
relative to the longitudinal axis (2a) of the breathing channel (2) to generate a

tangential flow against the flow body (5).
Appliance according to Claim 1, characterised in that the flow body (5) has an enlarged
section (5b) at the tip of the tapering section (5a). 
Appliance according to Claim 2, characterised in that the enlarged section (5b) has a
diameter that is smaller than the maximum diameter (d
5amax
) and larger than the
minimum diameter (d
5amin
) of the tapering section (5a).
Appliance according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the enlarged section (5c) is
spherical or elliptical.
Appliance according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, characterised in that the transition from the
tapering section (5a) to the enlarged section (5c) is continuous.
Appliance according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the flow body (5)
has, at the end of the tapering section (5a) opposite to the tip, a cylindrical section (5c)

whose diameter is equal to the maximum diameter (d5amax) of the tapering section (5a).
Appliance according to one of the Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the maximum
diameter of the tapering section (5a) is smaller than the diameter of the breathing channel

(2), in that there is provided a flat carrier (6) in the breathing channel (5) to support the
flow body (5), whose diameter is essentially equal to the diameter of the breathing

channel (2) and which has arch-shaped slots (6c) in the region extending beyond the flow
body, and in that there is provided on the side of the support (6) facing away from the

flow body a thin elastic disk (7) which, at least based on elastic forces, seals the slots
(6a) in a resting position and during an inhalation process.
Appliance according to one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the longitudinal
axes (3a, 4a) of the air channel (3) and of the aerosol channel (4) respectively lie in one

plane and the longitudinal axis (2c) of the breathing channel (2) runs perpendicularly to
this plane.
Appliance according to Claim 8, characterised in that the arrangement of the air channel
(3) and of the aerosol channel (4) is symmetrical relative to the longitudinal axis (2c) of

the breathing channel (2).
Appliance according to one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the flow body (5)
is arranged in a sleeve (11) that can be plugged into the valve block (1) and surrounds 

the breathing channel (2), and the valve block (1) has first and second holes (13a, 13b)
drilled in it to accommodate the securing bolts to lock the sleeve (11) in position.
Appliance according to one of the Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the valve block
(1) has third and fourth holes (14a, 14b) drilled in it to accommodate PTC (positive

temperature coefficient) heating elements.
