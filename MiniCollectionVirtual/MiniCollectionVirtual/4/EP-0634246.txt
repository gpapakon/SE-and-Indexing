<ABSTRACT>
A computer-controlled robot cutting system for making angled 
or beveled cuts along a preselected path in a workpiece having 

a generally planar cutting surface. A cutting knife, such as a 
high-intensity fluid jet, is pivotably mounted in a support frame 

having two pairs of arcuate guides disposed at right angles to 
each other for motor-driven rotation of the cutting knife about 

orthogonal axes. The centers of curvature of both guides lie on 
a critical plane containing a pivot point about which the cutting 

knife pivots. An opposing workpiece gantry with horizontal and 

vertical slides for motor-driven translation of the workpiece 
along two axes also includes means for holding the workpiece such 

that its surface to be cut faces the cutting knife and lies in 
the critical plane. The workpiece is thus translated to define 

the cutting path on the obverse surface, while the cutting knife 
is pivoted to define the entry angle of the cut along the cutting 

path. Four motion controllers under computer control coordinate 
the motors driving each axis of rotation or translation. Because 

the obverse cutting surface of the workpiece is maintained in the 
critical plane containing the pivot point, pivoting of the knife 

does not change its entry point in the cutting surface, thereby 
simplifying motion control algorithms. Furthermore, because the 

cutting knife is pivoted and the workpiece is translated, the 
relatively massive gearing and movable frame structures are 

distributed between the cutting knife section and the workpiece 
gantry, lowering the inertia and enabling the use of lighter-duty 

motors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of robot
cutting and, more particularly, to cutting systems for making a
beveled cut in a workpiece along a preselected path by means of
computer-controlled motion controllers for coordinating the
translation and rotation of the workpiece relative to a cutting
knife, such as one emitting a high-speed fluid stream, wherein
the motion controllers control the path and entry angle of the
knife along a surface of the workpiece.Cutting tools that operate by directing a high-intensity
energy source such as a high-speed fluid stream along a cutting
path in a workpiece are used in many industrial applications to
cut various patterns. In simple cutting tools of this kind, the
fluid stream is emitted from a stationary nozzle and the
workpiece translated to produce the desired cutting path. A
similar effect can be achieved by maintaining the workpiece in
position and translating the nozzle. Often, it is necessary to
make a beveled or angled cut in a workpiece. To produce a
beveled cut, the nozzle must be pivoted with respect to the
workpiece to change the angle of entry of the fluid jet as it
advances along the cutting path. Coordination of translation and
pivotal rotation is essential to fast, accurate cutting.In the field of tuna fish processing, for example, the
completely or partly automated cutting of frozen slabs of tuna
to remove blood meat and skin portions from edible loin meat 
portions is described in three U.S. patents (3,800,363;
4,738,004; and Re. 33,917) to James M. Lapeyre and assigned to
the assignee of this application. Besides discussing the cutting
of tuna slabs along irregular paths, the patents also describe
scanners for producing images of one or both sides of the slabs
from which control signals are generated to control the cutting
apparatus. The two older patents US-A 3,800,363 and US-A 4,738,004
(preamble of claim 1)
discuss general methods of visioning and cutting tuna slabs with
few details of the conversion of the electrical signals
representing the cutting path as determined by the video scan
into control signals for the cutting apparatus. Reissued patent
Re. 33,917 shows a water jet robot relatively movable with
respect to the stationary slab to be cut. None of the patents
addresses the problem of achieving fast and accurate cutting
paths.The water jet nozzle on the water jet robot shown in Re.
33,917 is at the end of a sequence of pivot joints having long
and massive connecting arms that are unwieldy and slow,
exhibiting a lot of inertia,
