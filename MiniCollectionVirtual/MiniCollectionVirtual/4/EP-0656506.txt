<ABSTRACT>
A pressure vessel (10) is disclosed for holding fluids and the like. 
The vessel includes an outer shell (18) fabricated of a composite 

material. A 
damage mitigating material (50) is integrated within the outer shell, 

with a major 
thickness (52) of the shell being disposed inside the damage mitigating 

material 
and a minor thickness (54) of the shell being disposed outside the damage 

mitigating 
material. The minor thickness of the shell and the damage mitigating 

material are physically alterable or deformable upon impact by a given 
exterior force which may be insufficient to affect the major thickness 

of the shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the art of pressure vessels
and, particularly, to a damage mitigating system which improves impact
resistance and enables visual observation of potential interior damage to the
vessel.In many applications, the qualities of lightweight construction
and high resistance to fragmentation and corrosion damage are highly
desirable characteristics for a pressure vessel. These design criteria have
been met for many years by the development of high pressure composite
(fiber reinforced resin matrix) containers; for instance, containers fabricated
of laminated layers of wound fiberglass filaments or various types of other
synthetic filaments which are bonded together by a thermal-setting or
thermoplastic resin. An elastomeric or other non-metal resilient liner or
bladder often is disposed within the composite shell to seal the vessel and
prevent internal fluids from contacting the composite material.Such composite vessels have become commonly used for
containing a variety of fluids under pressure, such as storing oxygen, natural
gas, nitrogen, rocket or other fuel, propane, etc. The composite construction
of the vessels provides numerous advantages such as lightness in
weight and resistance to corrosion, fatigue and catastrophic failure. These
attributes are due to the high specific strengths of the reinforcing fibers or 
filaments which typically are oriented in the direction of the principal forces
in the construction of the pressure vessels.Composite pressure vessels of the character described above
originally were developed for aircraft and aerospace applications primarily
because of the critical weight restrictions in such vehicles. These applications
provided a relatively safe environment in which damage to the vessels
could be minimized and, in fact, impact damage from extraneous, unintended
collisions rarely occurred. However, the growing use of composite
pressure vessels in general commercial applications has significantly increased
the potential for the vessels to be subjected to uncontrolled damage
which may significantly affect the strength of a vessel without showing any
obvious visual damage. For instance, during shipment or other handling, a
vessel may be dropped and suffer interior or structural damage which is
visually undetectable when observing the exterior or shell of the vessel. A
damaged vessel might be installed for its intended or ultimate use without
anyone even knowing that the vessel was damaged.Some contemporary approaches to solving these
