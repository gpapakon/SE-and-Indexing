<ABSTRACT>
The implement is of the type which is hinged to a 
carrier arm (5) for pivoting around an axis (4) transverse 

to the carrier arm (5) and which comprises a stopping device 
for preventing said pivoting. The stopping device 

comprises a first member (8) fastened to the implement (1) 
and a second member (11) fastened to the carrier arm (5), 

the two members (8,11) being mutually connected in such a 
way that they and in particular their connections with the 

implement (1) and the carrier arm (5), respectively, are 
movable relative to each other between two extreme positions 

and adapted to take up a mutual position, in which 
they block the movement, the stopping device comprising an 

activating means (13) for acting on at least one of the two 
members (8) in a direction towards the position, in which 

the movement is blocked.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement of the
type which close to a vertical plane through the mass
centre of the implement is hinged to a carrier arm for
pivoting around an axis transverse to the carrier arm and
which comprises a stopping device for preventing said
pivoting, the carrier arm being hinged to a frame
connectable with a tractor for swinging between an
operating position and a transport position, wherein the
stopping device comprises a first member fastened to the
implement and a second member fastened to the carrier arm,
the two members are mutually engaging in such a way that
they and in particular their connections with the implement
and the carrier arm, respectively, are movable relative to
each other between two extreme positions, and that they are
adapted to take up a mutual position, in which they block
the movement. An implement of this art is known from DE-A-1
582 356.An implement of the above type is a lift-suspended
mower. Such a mower generally comprises several rotating
knife means placed in a row and is pivotally suspended in
a carrier arm for being adjustable during operation to the
surface of a field to be mowed. The mower in question is
adapted in view of transport to be swung with its carrier
arm to a raised position behind the vehicle, for instance
a tractor, on which it is mounted. For such transport the
uncontrolled swinging in relation to the carrier arm is
undesirable, and the implement therefore comprises a stopping
device, by means of which the mower can be locked
relative to the carrier arm. However, the known stopping
devices suffer from the drawback that they are manually
operated and requires that the driver of the tractor leaves
the tractor when switching to a transport position in order
to activate the stopping device and consequently lock the
mower relative to the carrier arm.The object of the invention is to provide an implement 
of the type mentioned by way of introduction, in which
implement the stopping device is automatically activated,
when the implement is switched to a transport position.From GB-A-2 157 936 is known a lift-suspended mower
which at one side is hinged to a carrier arm for pivoting
around an axis transverse to the carrier arm and which
comprises a stopping device for preventing said pivoting.
The stopping device comprises a sliding bolt and the
possibility of automatically moving the sliding bolt to an
unlocked position when the implement is in a mowing
position is mentioned. However an enabling disclosure is
not given.The object

<CLAIMS>
An implement of the type which close to a vertical
plane through the mass centre of the implement is hinged to

a carrier arm for pivoting around an axis (4) transverse to
the carrier arm (5) and which comprises a stopping device

for preventing said pivoting, the carrier arm (5) being
hinged to a frame connectable with a tractor for swinging

between an operating position and a transport position,
wherein the stopping device comprises a first member (8;

15) fastened to the implement (1) and a second member (11;
16) fastened to the carrier arm (5), the two members (8,

11; 15, 16) are mutually engaging in such a way that they
and in particular their connections with the implement (1)

and the carrier arm (5), respectively, are movable relative
to each other between two extreme positions, and that they

are adapted to take up a mutual position, in which they
block the movement, 
characterized
 in that
the stopping device comprises an activating means

comprising a string (13) which when pulled acts on at least
one of the two members (8; 15, 16) in a direction towards

the position, in which the movement is blocked, said string
(13) being connected with the frame in such a way that it

is pulled when the carrier arm (5) is swung to the
transport position.
An implement according to claim 1,

characterized
 in that the stopping device
comprises a spring (12) which acts on at least one of the

two members (8; 15, 16) in a direction away from the position,
in which the movement is blocked.
An implement according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized
 in that one of the two members
(8) comprises a track (10) with a long leg and a short leg

substantially perpendicular to one another, and that said
member is hinged to the implement (1) or the carrier arm in

such a way that the long leg of the track (10) extends
towards the hinge axis of the member (8), and that the 

short leg of the track extends transversely to the hinge
axis of the member (8), and that the second member comprises

a pin (11) adapted to engage the track, said pin
being stationary relative to the carrier arm (5) or the

implement.
