<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moulding machine with a sand-filling station (A) and a compaction station (B) and with a turntable (3) that can be rotated about a central column (2). In order to be able to transport moulding boxes (10) through the moulding machine in a straight line by means of a drive arranged outside the machine, the invention provides for the arrangement, in the region of the turntable (3), of a spacer element (13) which is mounted for horizontal reversible motion, can be introduced into an interspace between an empty moulding box (10) and the moulding box (10b) situated in the compaction station (B) and can be moved with the moulding boxes (10, 10b).

A moulding machine with a sand-filling station (
A
) and a compacting station (
B
) situated
downstream of the sand-filling station (
A
) in the conveying direction of moulding boxes
(10) by a conveying device, a vertical central column (2), on which a turntable (3) is

mounted, being arranged between the sand-filling station (
A
) and the compacting station
(
B
), and the turntable (3) being rotatable by 180Â° in each case for conveying a moulding
box (10a) filled with sand together with a pattern plate (5a) and a filling frame (8a) from

the sand-filling station (
A
) into the compacting station (
B
) and at the same time for conveying
an empty filling frame (8b) from the compacting station (
B
) into the sand-filling
station (
A
), and with one respective lifting station (1a, 1b) in the region of the sand-filling
station (
A
) and the compacting station (
B
), the conveying device being straight at
least in the region of the sand-filling station (
A
) and the compacting station (
B
), and the
moulding boxes being displaced in a clock-timed manner, 
characterized in that
 a spacer
element (13), which is mounted in a horizontally reversing manner and which can be

moved into an intermediate space between an empty moulding box (10) and the moulding
box (10b) present in the compacting station (
B
) and closes it and is movable together
with the moulding boxes (10, 10b), is arranged in the region of the turntable (3).
A moulding machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the spacer element
(13) has the length of two moulding boxes (10).
A moulding machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the spacer
element (13) is mounted in a central bearing element (14) arranged in the region of the

central column (2).
A moulding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the spacer
element (13) is arranged above the conveying plane of a conveying path (20) situated in

front of and behind the moulding machine.
A moulding machine according to one of Claims 3 [and] 4, 
characterized in that
 the
spacer element (13) and/or the bearing element (14) thereof can be moved into the conveying

path (20) of the moulding boxes (10).
A moulding machine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the spacer element
(13) and/or the bearing element (14) thereof can be moved into the conveying path by 

means of a rocking lever (21).
A moulding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 a plurality
of spacer elements (13) are provided.
A moulding machine according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the plurality of spacer
elements (13) are constructed in the form of mutually parallel spacer rods.
