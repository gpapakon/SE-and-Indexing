A method of making a pulley (1) having an essentially 
pot-shaped profile, whose belt rest (7) is bounded 

at least on one side in the axial direction by an 
integrally moulded-on flanged wheel (2), and having an 

inertia ring (6) which is connected to the pulley (1) by 
means of the damping ring (5) of elastomeric material, 

the moulded-on flanged wheel (2) merging in the axial 
direction into a hub ring (3) which is formed by a 

projection and is connected to the inertia ring (6) by 
means of the damping ring (5), characterized in that the 

belt rest (7) and the projection (8) are produced by the 
fact that the pulley body (1) extending in the radial 

direction is firstly split and the partial regions thus 
produced are shaped in each case in the opposite axial 

direction and that, following the shaping in the axial 
direction, on the one hand the profiling of the belt rest 

(7) is produced and, on the other hand, in the axial 
direction the torsional vibration damper (4) is 

completed. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the projection (8) shaped counter to the belt rest 

(7) is enclosed on the outer and/or inner circumferential 
side by the damping ring (5) and inertia ring (6) to 

complete the torsional vibration damper (4).
