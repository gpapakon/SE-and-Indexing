<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent a twin brake pressure regulator with a control plunger and a balance arm from exercising its pressure attenuating function by means of an electromagnetic locking device, and to avoid high costs and material expenditure, the electric coil (18), together with the cutout blade (17) and the locking member (16) secured thereto, is radially arranged with respect to the regulating piston (3), and the locking member (16) is interlocked with the control plunger (13). Preferably a U-shaped fork whose inner diameter is adapted to the control plunger is arranged for that purpose on the locking member (16). In an appropriate manner, the extended position, i.e. the position in which the locking member (16) locks the control plunger (13), is defined by the position of the cutout blade (17) when the coil (18) is energized, whereas the retracted position of the locking member (16), in which the control plunger (13) is released, results from moving back the cutcout blade (17) when the coil (18) is without current. This twin brake pressure regulator is thus suitable for use in antilock braking systems, in which the pressure attenuating function is suspended as long as the antilock function can be exercised, and only comes into operation when the antilock function is suspended.

<CLAIMS>
A twin-type brake force regulator having two bores (2) 
arranged in parallel in a housing, a control piston (3) being 

axially slidably guided and sealed in each of the bores, 
including an actuating device having a control tappet (13) 

and a beam of balance (14), and the control tappet (13) 
centrally applies an axial control force to the beam of 

balance (14), and the control force is transmitted by both 
arms of the beam of balance (14) to each of the control 

pistons (3), and including a locking device (16, 17, 18) 
having an electric coil (18), a magnet armature (17) slidable 

in the coil and a locking member (16) which is attached to 
the magnet armature (17) and is movable with it,
characterized
 in that the locking device (16, 
17, 18) is radially arranged so that the magnet armature (17) 

is radially movable with respect to the axes of the housing 
bores (2), and in that the locking member (16), in its 

advanced position, is in positive engagement with the control 
tappet (13) and, in its retracted position, releases the 

control tappet (13). 
A twin-type brake force regulator as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the magnet armature (17) 
retains the locking member (16) in its advanced position when 

the coil (18) is energized. 
A twin-type brake force regulator as claimed in claim 1 or in 
claim 2,
characterized
 in that, at its end close to the 
control tappet (13), the locking member (16) has a U-shaped  

 
fork (24), the inner curve (27) of which is adapted to the 

diameter of the control tappet (13) at the point of 
engagement, and in that the control tappet (13) has an 

enlarged portion with a step (26) directly beneath the point 
of engagement towards the beam of balance (14). 
A twin-type brake force regulator as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the control force is 
variable load-responsively.
