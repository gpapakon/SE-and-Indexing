<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for determining stable and labile glycated compound 
levels in blood. Electromagnetic energy covering a multiplicity of wavelength bands within 

a wavelength range from 380 nm to 2500 nm is directed into a sample volume containing 
blood. Portions of the energy representative of both the source energy and energy after 

interacting with material within the sample volume are collected. The energy portions 
carry information relating to the source energy and the levels of labile and stable 

compounds within the sample volume, respectively. The portions are converted into 
electrical signals representative of the intensities of the respective portions in each of the 

multiplicity of wavelength bands. The electrical signals are pretreated in accordance with 
known information to remove deviations from established reference conditions to form data 

signals that are a function of the fractional portion of the energy in each of the wavelength 
bands absorbed and scattered by the material in the measurement volume. Selected groups 

of the data signals are processed in accordance with chemometric models developed from 
analysis of such data signals together with known values of the analytes derived from 

measurements on a calibration set of samples larger in number than the number of 
wavelength bands included in the set of the selected groups of data signals to develop 

analyte signals representative of the amounts of glycated compounds for which 
chemometric models have been developed and utilized. The analyte signals may be stored 

and displayed in a form suitable for medical use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the in-vivo and in-vitro measurement of glucose-related
analytes by spectroscopic means.Diabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by a body's failure to either produce insulin
or use insulin effectively. The hormone, insulin, enables a body to utilize glucose.
Approximately 1.4 million Americans suffer from Type I diabetes, where the body fails. to
produce insulin, and an additional 13 million Americans suffer from type II diabetes, where
the body fails to utilize insulin effectively. Currently, seven percent of Americans have
diabetes. This percentage is expected to rise to approximately ten percent by the year
2000.Recent studies have indicated that frequent monitoring and control of blood glucose
levels reduces the possibility of serious complications in diabetics by fifty to sixty percent.
These studies utilized measurements of the stable glycated hemoglobin complex HbA1c to
evaluate the long-term time average blood glucose level over a several months period
immediately preceding the time the sample was taken. The long-term average is based on
the approximately 120 day life of the red blood cells containing the glycated hemoglobin.
HbA1c consists of 50 to 90% hemoglobin glycated by a ketoamine linkage at the beta chain 
N-terminal valine residue. Medical practitioners also use the level of the stable glycated
albumin complex fructosamine within the blood serum to provide an evaluation of the
approximately 2 to 3 week medium-term time average glucose level of the patient. These
two measurements, combined with the immediate blood glucose level, are of great value
in diagnosing and treating diabetes. There is medical evidence that the formation of
glucose-protein and glucose-lipid complexes may be the direct cause of some of the
degenerative effects of diabetes as well as those of aging. In addition to the stable
complexes, glucose forms labile complexes with proteins and lipids which are the
precursors of the stable complexes. The level of these labile complexes are in equilibrium
with the glucose level of the surrounding medium and are therefore highly correlated with
the present level of blood glucose. This is particularly true in-vivo because the equilibrium
has not been disturbed by the collection or handling of an in-vitro sample. Pre-Hemoglobin
A1c is a labile form of glycated Hb containing glucose bound in aldimine linkage to the beta
chain N-terminal valine residue.The methods currently used to directly measure the levels of stable glycated protein
and lipid
