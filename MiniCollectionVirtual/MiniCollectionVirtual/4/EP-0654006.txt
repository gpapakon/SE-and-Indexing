<ABSTRACT>
A combined stairway and lift apparatus comprising a stairway (40) which, by a lifting means (48), can be raised and lowered at least at one end, and wherein the steps (44) all the time are horizontal during the raising or lowering movement, the stairway (40) in a horizontal position forming a planar surface flush with a raisable and lowerable platform (47). The platform (47) is interconnected with the stairway (40) at the lower end thereof. Further, the stairway together with the platform may be raised and lowered by means of parallel stays (41, 42) which at one end are pivotally connected to a support means (45) at the upper end of the stairway (40), the parallel stays (41, 42) along their length being pivotally connected to a number of additional vertical stays (43) which are connected to respective steps (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a combined stairway and lift apparatus, specially intended
for handicapped persons, comprising a stairway which, by a lifting means, can be raised and
lowered at least at one end, and which is designed so that the steps all the time are horizonal
during the raising or lowering movement, the stairway in a horizontal position forming a
planar surface flush with a raisable and lowerable platform, according to the preamble of
claim 1.An apparatus of the above-mentioned type is known from SE laying-open print No.
462 335. This known apparatus consists of an elevator portion and a stairway portion
connected thereto, wherein the elevator portion comprises an elevator platform which is
raisable and lowerable between at least two levels, and wherein the stairway portion is
connected to the elevator portion in such a manner that the stairway portion automatically
follows the movements of the elevator portion, so that the stairway portion in a lowered
position forms a planar surface on which a load can be run onto the elevator platform. The
apparatus may be used as a stairway and/or a lift between stories in a house, as a loading
platform with side stairway at a loading quay, as a freight elevator in storage premises, etc.
The construction of the apparatus implies, however, substantial restrictions with respect to
fields of use. Among other things, it cannot be adapted for use as e.g. a wheelchair lift in
public means of transportation, such as buses, railway cars, etc., with a varying entering
height.Also US-A-784832 deals with a combined stairway and hoist apparatus, the steps of
which are horizontal during the raising and lowering movement of the one end of the
apparatus. Due to this construction however, there is a great risk of getting a limb caught
between a stay and a step.In the recent time there has been carried out some research activity with respect to
the possibilities of arranging the conditions for handicapped persons in public means of
transportation. In this connection it has become clear that today there do not exist sufficiently
good and quick solutions for lifts which can be recommended for short-distance traffic with
buses or the like. In public means of transportation for short-distance traffic there must be
made heavy demands on regularity, and it will then not be of current interest to install lifts
which become too time-consuming and make too heavy demands on drivers/conductors. A combined stairway and lift apparatus for public means
of transportation should also

<CLAIMS>
A combined stairway and hoist apparatus, comprising a stairway (1; 40; 62; 89)
which, by a lifting means (4; 48; 71; 101), may be raised and lowered at least at one end, and

which is designed so that the steps (2; 44; 63; 95) all the time are horizontal during the raising
or lowering movement, the stairway in a horizontal position forming a planar surface flush

with a raisable and lowerable platform (3; 47; 65; 97), the platform (3; 47; 65; 97) is
interconnected with the stairwa
y (1; 40; 62; 89) at the lower end thereof, and that the stairway
together with the platform can be raised and lowered by means of parallel stays (5, 6; 41; 42;

66, 67; 90, 91) which at one end are pivotally connected to a support means (7; 45; 68; 92) at
the upper end of the stairway (1; 40; 62; 89), 
characterized
 in that the parallel stays
along their length being pivotally connected to a number of additional stays (8; 43; 70; 94)

which are rigidly connected to respective steps (2; 44; 63; 95) and are essentially vertical in
operating position.
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the parallel
stays (5, 6) are arranged below the steps (2), the support means (7) being constituted by a

floor structure at the upper end of the stairway (1), and the parallel stays (5, 6) further being
connected to the platform (3) via a movement-transferring arm system (11, 12).
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the parallel
stays (41, 42; 66, 67; 90, 91) constitute string and/or railing members along the side of the

stairway (40; 62; 89), the vertical stays (43; 70; 94) forming balusters in the railing, and the
support structure being constituted by a column (45; 68; 92) with which the string or railing

members are connected.
An apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the vertical
stays (43; 70; 94) are perpendicular to the tread surface thereof.
An apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the vertical
stays (145; 163) are hingedly connected to the steps (146; 164), so that these are rotatable

between a position parallel with the stays (145; 163), and a position at right 
angles thereto.

CHARACTERIZED IN
 that the string and railing members (41, 42) at
their lower end are pivotally connected to a hollow column (46)

in which the lifting means (48) is built in, the lifting means
(48) being wheel-supported (49) for movement along the base (50;

53) when raising and lowering the stairway (40) and the platform

An apparatus according to any of the claims 3-6,

CHARACTERIZED IN
 that the platform (78) in the transverse
direction of the stairway (62) is divided into two or more

members (77, 78) which are displaceably arranged on top of each
other, so that the platform (78) may be pushed together and

extended in the longitudinal direction of the stairway (62).

are mounted at the inside of a scuttle or door-forming plate

(120) which is pivotally mounted about a horizontal axis (126)
at the lower end of a wall opening (121), and which is divided

at a transversely extending hinge axis (129) at the transition
between stairway (123) and platform (124), so that the stairway

(123) and the platform (124) may be brought into operative
position by swinging-out the door plate (120) by means of the
