<ABSTRACT>
A computer implemented abductive reasoner checks for 
contradictions in the reasoning operations during 

processing and determines subsequent processing dependent 
upon the results of the checking. Constraints on 

variables may be imposed to permit proofs to be pursued 
which otherwise would involve contradictions. Different 

types of abductive reasoning step may be assigned 
different costs and proofs or future processing steps 

selected dependent upon the costing. Alternatively or 
in addition, reasoning operations and the resulting 

proofs, if any, may be grouped according to the types of 
reasoning steps involved and provision may be included 

for pursuing operations involving less costly reasoning 
steps in preference or prior to operations which may be 

more costly. Where successive goals are to be proved, 
the proof of each successive goal may be performed by 

reference to hypotheses established in proofs of previous 
goals. In applications involving the production of 

control signals, commands defining required control 
signals may be provided in the form of premises in rules 

contained in a knowledge base with which the abducer 
operates and means may be provided for outputting said 

commands and converting them to the required control 
signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for data 
processing and/or for producing control signals, for 
example for controlling a further process or system or 
for controlling a display or other output device for 
providing information about the further process or 
system. The invention may be used in a wide range of 
applications. Methods and apparatus for generating signals for 
information which may be used for control purposes have 
long been known. An example of a very simple form of 
control is the thermostatic control of a heating system 
in which a temperature sensor provides a signal 
indicating the value of the temperature to be controlled 
and a signal to switch a heater on or off is generated 
so as to maintain the temperature within required limits. 
A wide variety of other simple control systems are known 
in the prior art in a wide variety of applications 
including the control of machinery and industrial 
processes where the value of a variable is sensed and a 
control signal generated, for example, to enable the 
variable to be maintained within desired limits. The 
control signals may be generated as part of a feedback 
arrangement so that the variable may be automatically  
 
maintained within the desired limits or may be used for 
providing a display or other output, such as a printed 
output or a warning signal, the information from which 
is used by an operator for monitoring or control 
purposes. As technology progressed, more complex control systems 
of hard-wired digital form were developed. Such 
digital control systems would comprise a logic circuit 
consisting of numerous logic gates for providing various 
logical functions, such as AND functions, OR functions, 
NAND functions, NOR functions or exclusive OR functions, 
and various registers for storing signals to be applied 
to and processed by the various logic gates. The logic 
circuit implements a set of logical operations in 
accordance with logical rules which would be determined 
by an engineer familiar with the system to be controlled 
and which specify the output signals to be produced in 
response to different input signals or combinations 
thereof. Thus, for example, if a particular output 
signal is represented as x and if a to d represent 
certain input signals, a logic circuit might be designed 
to produce the output signal x if input signals a, b and 
c but not d are present. A rule expressing such logical 
operation could therefore be expressed as follows:
 
   x if a and b and c andnot d.  The circuit
