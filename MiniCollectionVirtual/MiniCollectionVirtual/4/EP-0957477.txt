<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording medium, especially an optical disk,
for recording and reproducing a large capacity of
information with a laser beam, and recording and
reproduction therefor.A read-only optical recording medium with a laser
beam includes optical disks called as a compact disk (CD),
a laser disk (LD) and a digital video disk (DVD). Among
the commercial read-only optical information recording
media, a DVD disk can record signals at the highest density.
According to the DVD format, a read-only DVD has diameter
of 120 mm, and a user capacity of 4.7 GB at maximum for
single layer type for single side reading, that of 9.4 GB
for single layer type for double side reading, or that of
8.5 GB for two-layers type for single side reading. For
example, a two-layers type DVD for single side reading has
first and second information layers, and signals recorded
in either of first and second information layers can be 
reproduced with a laser bean irradiated from one side of
the optical disk. A method for fabricating a read-only DVD
having a multi-layer structure is described for example in
United States Patent No. 5,126,996.Optical information recording media which can
record and reproduce signals with a laser beam include a
phase-change type optical disk, a magneto-optical disk and a
dye disk. In a phase-change type optical disk, a
chalcogenide is used usually as a recording thin film
material. Generally, when the recording thin film material
is in the crystalline state, it is taken as a non-recorded
state. A signal is recorded by irradiating a laser beam to
melt the magnetic thin film material and to cool it quickly
to the amorphous state. When a recorded signal is erased, a
laser beam having a power lower than that for recording is
irradiated to change the recording layer to the crystalline
state. Because the chalcogenide magnetic thin film is
formed with deposition in the amorphous state, it is
necessary to crystallize all the surface of the recording
region beforehand to result in the non-recorded state. This
initial crystallization is usually included in a part of the
disk manufacturing steps. A recording thin film is
crystallized with a light source of a laser light source or
a flash one.In order to enhance the signal recording speed for 
a phase-change type optical disk on which recording and
erasing are possible, so-called light absorption correction
is proposed which is suitable for high linear speed
recording (for example, Japanese Patent laid open
