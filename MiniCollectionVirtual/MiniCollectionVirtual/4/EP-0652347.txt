<ABSTRACT>
The sealing strip for an extruded profile (section) is made of thermoplastic elastomer and is of the tubular type; it has an oblong shape with a substantially flat semi-rigid rear face (12) and is preferably domed in its central part (13), supporting a fastening shoulder (step, ledge) (15). The plane part (16) of its front face (14) is connected to the rear face (12) by front inclined sidewalls (17) and rear inclined sidewalls (18) which are joined by rounded edges (27). The angle ( beta ) between the inclined sidewalls (17, 18) is of the order of or slightly less than 90 DEG . The profile, made of polyvinyl chloride or made of a synthetic resin, for a fixed timberwork frame which includes at least one joint having the aforementioned characteristics, is capable of receiving, arbitrarily, a fixed glazing or an opening frame (a casement or a leaf).
