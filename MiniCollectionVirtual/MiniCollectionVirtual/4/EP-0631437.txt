<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for recording teletext data on a tape 
by a VCR having a pair of heads which are switched at every 

field. Teletext data are stored in a memory (15) at an address 
where the teletext data do not overlap with a switching 

time of the heads. The stored teletext data are read 
out and used as a signal to be recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for recording
data of a teletext broadcast, and more particularly to a
system for simultaneously recording the teletext data and
video data of a television signal or the same recording
medium.The teletext is a new type of multiplex broadcasting system
where information other than regular television programs in
the form of characters, simple graphics and additional
sounds is transmitted. The information is repeatedly transmitted
so that a user may receive the information he
chooses at any chosen time.The teletext data in the form of digital signal are carried
during the vertical retrace line interval which is an empty
time space in the television signal. The user may watch any
teletext program of his choice on a television receiver
having a built-in decoder, or an ordinary television receiver
having a teletext adapter connected thereto.In one of the systems for recording the teletext data, the
data are decoded and converted into a television signal,
which is recorded by a VCR.In another system, the teletext data is applied to a personal
computer, which is operated by an exclusive keyboard
and stored on a hard disc.Referring to Fig. 3 showing the first system, a television
receiver receives broadcast waves through an antenna. The
wave of a particular channel which is selected by a television 
tuner 1 is converted into a television signal. Teletext
data included in the television signal is derived at a
teletext decoder 2 and recorded at a VCR 3 on a recording
tape in a video cassette. The data is also fed to a television
monitor 4 on which the data is shown.Fig. 4 shows the second recording system where the broadcast
wave converted into the television signal at the television
tuner 1 is fed to a personal computer 5. The user
operates an operation keyboard 6 connected to the computer
5 to extract the teletext data from the television signal
and to correct errors included therein. The teletext data
is then recorded on a hard disc 8. When reproducing the
data, the personal computer 5 processes the data on the
hard disc 8 and shows it on a screen of a CRT display 7.The VCR has a pair of heads provided on opposite sides of a
rotating drum with which a tape is contacted. One of the
heads scans odd fields, and the other head scans even
fields. Hence, the heads are switched in the vertical retrace
line interval for completing one whole picture frame.On the other hand, the teletext data are transmitted during
lines 13H, 15H, 16H and 21H in the vertical retrace line
interval.

<CLAIMS>
A system for recording teletext data contained in a
video signal on a tape by a recording device (VCR)

having a pair of heads which are switched at every
field, the system comprising:


detector means (10 - 14) for detecting teletext data;
shifting means (16) for shifting detected teletext
data to a position in the video signal where the

detected teletext data do not overlap with a switching
time of the heads; and
output means (19, 22) for outputting the video signal
including the shifted teletext data to the recording

device (VCR).
The system according to claim 1, wherein the detected
teletext data are stored in a memory (15) at addresses

which are shifted to addresses where the teletext data
do not overlap with the switching timing.
The system according to claim 2, further comprising
information adding means (17) for adding information

on an original address of the teletext data to
teletext data derived from the memory (15).
