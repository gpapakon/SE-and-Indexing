<DESCRIPTION>
Chlor-alkali electrolysis is certainly the electrolytic 
process of greatest industrial interest. In general terms, 
said electrolysis process may be illustrated as the 
splitting of a starting reactant, which is an aqueous 
solution of sodium chloride (hereinafter defined as brine), 
to form gaseous chlorine, sodium hydroxide in an aqueous 
solution and hydrogen. This splitting is made possible by 
the application of electrical energy which may be seen as a 
further reactant. Chlor-alkali electrolysis is carried out 
resorting to three technologies: with mercury cathodes 
cells, with porous diaphragms cells or with ion exchange 
membranes cells. This latter represents the most modern 
development and is characterized by low energy consumptions 
and by the absence of environmental or health drawbacks. Of 
the others, the mercury cathodes cells are probably destined 
for a sharp decline in use because of the severe 
restrictions adopted by most countries as regards the 
release of mercury to the atmosphere and soil. In fact, the 
most modern cell designs allow one to meet the severe  
 
requirements of the present regulations, but the public 
opinion rejects "a priori" any process which could lead to 
the possible release of heavy metals in the environment. The diaphragm process has also problems as the main 
component of the diaphragm is asbestos fibers, which is 
recognized to be a mutagenic agent. The most advanced 
technology foresees a diaphragm made by depositing a layer 
of asbestos fibers mixed with certain polymeric binders onto 
cathodes made of iron meshes. The structure thus obtained is 
then heated whereby the fusion of the polymeric particles 
permits the mechanical stabilization of the agglomerate of 
asbestos fibers. As a consequence, the release of fibers 
during operation (particularly in the drain liquids of the 
plant) is minimized, as well as the release to the 
atmosphere due to various expedients adopted during 
manipulation of the asbestos in the deposition step. However, this appears to be only sufficient to prolong 
the life of the diaphragm technology, in view of the ever 
increasing difficulty in the supply of asbestos fibers due 
to the progressive closing of the mines. For this reason, 
porous diaphragms have been developed where the asbestos 
fibers are substituted by fibers of inorganic materials 
considered to be completely safe, such as zirconium oxide, 
mechanically stabilized by polymeric binders. The deposition  
 
and the stabilization by heating in oven are carried
