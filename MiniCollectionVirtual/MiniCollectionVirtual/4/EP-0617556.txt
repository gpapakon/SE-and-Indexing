<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a broadcasting signal receiver
such as television signal receiver (hereinafter, TV
receiver) or radio signal receiver (hereinafter, radio receiver).
The invention concerns especially a broadcasting
signal receiver having a user interface which makes
it easy for users to operate the receiver.Conventional broadcasting signal receivers, specially
TV receivers, have many features and various
functions. The more features and functions TV receiver
has, the more control knobs and dials for selecting programs
or controlling or adjusting picture and sound qualities
are necessary. Most of modem TV receivers have
its remote controller which makes such selections, controls
and adjustments easier.In such a conventional remote controller, for instance,
there are 10 keys, up/down keys and toggle
keys. Because there is not enough space to be distributed
such control keys for the exclusive use of individual
functions, each key is manually or automatically
changed the function correspondingly to the using conditions
so as to be used alternatively for a plurality of
functions. For example, 10 keys are utilized for preset
and selection of programs and selection of pages of teletext.
Because there are many broadcasting stations
which can be received in a same area, however, it is
difficult for a user to remember the correspondence between
broadcasting stations and program numbers so
that it is troublesome to select a desired program with
10 keys. Similarly, page selection of the teletext with 10
key is also not so easy.Therefore, the up/down keys can be used for sequentially
selecting programs or pages of teletext. The
up/down keys are also used for sequentially adjusting a
value of each parameter of picture or sound quality and
for entering the data of such as alphabet and other characters
or symbols to add or change the names of programs.
The toggle keys are also used for selecting one
to be operated from a plurality of functions and parameters.In order to make such up/down keys and toggle
keys used easier, on screen display control has been
introduced. As examples, in case of program selection,
while the program list including all receivable broadcasting
stations is indicated on the screen of the TV receiver,
respective programs are sequentially distinguished
from the other by, for instance, blinking, highlight, or a
different color with the sequential operation of the up/down
keys. When the desired program is distinguished,
the selection of the desired program is made by depressing
a confirmation
