<ABSTRACT>
In a procedure for determining a volume flow, a fluid is guided through a measuring line having a defined cross-section. In the measuring line, the flow velocity and the degree of filling of the measuring line are determined, and the volume flow is determined from the flow velocity, the cross-section of the measuring line and the degree of filling of the measuring line. The determination of the flow velocity and of the degree of filling is carried out using a measuring chamber at the same instant and at the same location with respect to the axial extension of the measuring line.

Method for determining a volume flow, in which

a fluid is passed through a measuring line with a clearly
defined cross-section,
the flow velocity of the fluid is determined with electrodes
of a magnetic-inductive flowmeter (MID), which is supplied

with a low frequency or clocked signal for generating a
switched or clocked steady or alternating magnetic field and

a velocity-dependent measuring voltage applied to two electrodes
is induced,
the degree of filling of the measuring line is determined
and
the volume flow is established from the flow velocity of the
fluid, the cross-section of the measuring line and the degree

of filling of the measuring line,

wherein

an a.c. voltage is supplied to the two electrodes, the frequency
of the a.c. voltage being significantly higher than

the frequency of the low frequency or clocked signal, so as
in this way to determine the conductivity of the fluid between

the electrodes for establishing the degree of filling
and
the determination of the flow velocity and the degree of
filling takes place at the same time and at the same location

and is performed in a measuring chamber with the aid of
control and evaluation electronics.
