<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a circuitry comprising an oscillator (1) for 
oscillating an electric signal, a comparator (14) being electrically 

connected to the oscillator (1) for fetching the electric signal from the 
oscillator (1) and subsequent comparison in phase of an external input signal 

with the electric signal for generation of a detecting signal according to 
a result of the comparison, a charge-pump (13) including first and second 

current sources (50,51) being electrically connected in parallel to the 
comparator (14) for fetching the detecting signal from the comparator (14) 

and subsequent generation of first and second pump currents by the first and 
second current sources (50,51) respectively on the basis of the detecting 

signal and a filter (12,22) being electrically connected to the oscillator 
(1) and the charge-pump (13) for fetching the pump currents from the 

charge-pump (13) and subsequent smoothing of the pump current to be supplied 
to the oscillator (1) thereby controlling the electric signal to match the 

electric signal to the external input signal by a negative feedback. This 
allows for an independent selection of the damping factor and of the natural 

frequency of the phase-locked loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a phase-lock loop circuit, and 
more particularly to a charge-pump phase-lock loop circuit 
which can readily be constructed by use of small resistance 
and capacitance. A charge-pump phase-lock loop circuit is suitable for a 
metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit. The 
construction of the charge-pump phase-lock loop circuit is 
disclosed in "Charge-Pump Phase-Lock Loops," IEEE 
TRANSACTION ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. COM-28, NO. 11, 
NOVEMBER 1980. Fig. 1 shows a conventional charge-pump 
phase-lock loop circuit. The conventional charge-pump 
phase-lock loop circuit comprises a voltage-controlled 
oscillator 31 controlled by a control voltage, a phase 
comparator 34 for detecting a difference in phase between 
an external input signal "IN" and an output signal "OUT" of 
the voltage-controlled oscillator 31, a charge-pump 33 for 
generating a pump current on the basis of an output signal 
of the phase comparator 34 and loop filter 32 for smoothing 
the pump current of the charge-pump 33 to generate the  
 
control voltage for the voltage-controlled oscillator 34. In operation, an external input signal "IN" and an output 
signal "OUT" from the voltage-controlled oscillator 31 are 
compared by the phase comparator 34. As a result of this 
comparison, a signal "UP" is supplied from the phase 
comparator 34 to the charge-pump 33 if the input signal 
"IN" leads the output signal "OUT" in phase. By contrast, 
a signal "DOWN" is supplied from the phase comparator 34 to 
the charge-pump 33 if the output signal "OUT" leads the 
input signal "IN" in phase. The signal "UP" or the signal 
"DOWN" is supplied for a predetermined time corresponding 
to the phase difference between the input signal "IN" and 
the output signal "OUT." After that, the pump current is 
generated by the charge-pump 33 to the loop filter 32 on 
the basis of the signal "UP" or the signal "DOWN" from the 
phase comparator 34. In the loop filter 32, the pump 
current is smoothed to be supplied as the control voltage 
to the voltage-controlled oscillator 34. The voltage-controlled 
oscillator 34 is controlled by the control 
voltage to supply an electric signal to the next stage. As explained above, the output signal of the voltage-controlled 
oscillator 31 is negatively fed back to the 
phase comparator 34 by a feedback control and a signal is 
handled by phase-lock loop circuit to be applied the 
control voltage to voltage-controlled oscillator 31 so that 
the phase of the output signal "OUT" approaches the phase
