<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric iron with a sole plate (3) which has a low thermal capacity and which can be heated by means of light energy from lamps (6), reflectors (7) being provided which reflect the light to the sole plate (3) and a sensor monitoring the temperature of the sole plate (3), having a microprocessor (13) which detects the measured values of the sensors (12), which compares these measured values with presettable desired values of a temperature setting device (14) and which is connected to a power control unit (15) which connects the lamps (6) individually, in series or in parallel, in the form of a halfwave control.

An electric smoothing iron comprising a soleplate (3) which has a low 
heat capacity and which is heatable by means of light energy produced by lamps (6), 

reflectors (7) being provided to reflect the light to the soleplate (3), and the temperature 
of the soleplate (3) being monitored by means of a sensor, 
characterized by
 a 
microprocessor (13) which receives the measurement values from the sensor (12), 

compares said measurement values with presettable nominal values of a temperature 
control device (14), and is connected to a power control unit (15) which acts as a half-wave 

control and operates the lamps (6) separately, in series or in parallel. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the heat capacity of the soleplate (3) is approximately 0.5 to 1.5 x 10
-4
 Wh/Kcm
2
. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized 
in that
 when the difference between the actual temperature and the nominal temperature 
remains uninterruptedly below, for example, 1 K - depending on the magnitude of the 

nominal temperature - for a duration of, for example, twelve measurement cycles the 
microprocessor (13) identifies this as a condition of rest of the iron and switches back to 

a lower standby temperature which is safe for the fabric to be ironed. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in any one or several of the Claims 
1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 after identification of the rest condition the microprocessor 
(13) stores and continually updates the last, for example, four soleplate temperatures, 

computes a gradient therefrom, stores said gradient and compares it with the preceding 
one, identifies distinct changes of, for example, 20% as the start of the ironing process 

and switches to the previous nominal temperature. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized 
in that
 a transparent partition (3a) is disposed inside the housing (1) of the iron spaced 
from the inner side of the soleplat
e (3) between the lamps (6) and the soleplate (3), 
between which partition and the soleplate (3) a steam chamber (3a) is formed into which 

water or steam can be fed. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in any one or several of the Claims  
 

1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the partition (3a) consists of a glass-ceramic or borosilicate 
glass. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 
the inner side of the soleplate has a heat-absorbing surface. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in any one or several of the Claims 
1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the microprocessor (13) has a timing element which at 
given time intervals checks whether the nominal temperature of the soleplate (3) has 

changed relative to its actual temperature and is responsive to a difference between the 
nominal and the actual temperature to control the temperature of the soleplate to the 

new nominal temperature by increasing or reducing the light power. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 
the steam is applied from a separate water heating device. 
An electric smoothing iron as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 
the steam ports in the soleplate are disposed in the direct radiation field of the lamps 

and reflectors.
