<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved receptacle connector for 
an IC card, which includes a housing (1) having terminal-receiving 

cavities (4) with terminals (2) mounted therein. 
Each terminal is fixed to a stopper (3) and the terminal-and-stopper 

assembly is press-fit within the housing to 
provide a seal which prevents the ingress of foreign 

particles into the IC card to avoid contamination of and 
damage to the circuitry of the internal circuit board of 

the IC card in which the receptacle connector is assembled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical 
connector, and more particularly, to a receptacle connector 
for an IC card. Figure 15 shows a conventional receptacle 
connector in an assembled IC card 54. As shown in the 
drawing, receptacle terminals 52 are press-fit in terminal-receiving 
cavities 53 of a housing 51. Although cover 
members 58 seal and protect the internal circuit board 56 
of the IC card from contaminants and other foreign 
substances, some moisture and other small size foreign 
substances may enter the IC card 54 via the cavities 53, as 
indicated by arrows 55. Therefore there is a potential for 
contamination of or damage to the integrated circuitry 57 
on the surface of internal circuit board 56 of the IC card. 
The portable nature of IC cards and the removal of the 
cards from relatively clean areas such as offices further 
increases the likelihood of the ingress of foreign 
substances into the IC card. In an attempt to solve the problem of 
contamination, it is proposed that housing 51 and terminals 
52 are integrally or unitarily formed, such as in a single 
overmolding process to eliminate cavities 53. The receptacle connector would then be sealed to 
the environment except for the smaller inlet apertures 61 
at the front mating edge thereof, which receive the contact 
pins of a mating connector (not shown).  
 This type of solution however is complicated and 
costly in terms of design, manufacturing and ultimate cost 
of the connector. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a sealed receptacle connector for an IC card, which 
receptacle connector prevents the ingress of foreign 
contaminants into the IC card, and which does not add 
significantly to the cost of manufacturing and assembling 
such receptacle connectors. To achieve this object, a receptacle connector is 
provided, which includes an insulative housing, a plurality 
of inlet apertures at a first end of the housing for 
receiving contacts of a mating connector, the inlet 
apertures communicating with terminal-receiving cavities 
extending rearwardly therefrom, and a corresponding 
plurality of receptacle terminals inserted in the cavities. 
Each of the plurality of receptacle terminals is connected 
to an insulative stopper, and each stopper is adapted to be 
press-fit within the housing at a second end thereof, 
whereby, when the terminals and stoppers are inserted in 
the terminal-receiving cavities, the cavities are sealed 
from the environment by the stoppers.

<CLAIMS>
A receptacle connector for an IC card 
comprising: 


an elongated housing (1) having a plurality of 
terminal-receiving cavities (4) extending therethrough, and 

a plurality of inlet openings (6) formed at a first end of 
the housing and communicating with the terminal-receiving 

cavities for receiving contact pins of a mating connector, 
a plurality of terminals (2) within the terminal-receiving 
cavities (4) for electrically connecting to the 

contact pins of the mating connector, 
a plurality of stoppers (3) each attached to a 
corresponding one of the plurality of terminals (2) 

wherein each stopper is press-fit within the housing at a 
second end thereof, whereby each terminal-receiving 

cavity is sealed by one of the stoppers to prevent the 
ingress of foreign particles therethrough. 
A receptacle connector as set forth in claim 
1 wherein the terminal-receiving cavities of the elongated 

housing and the terminals therein are arranged in two rows. 
A receptacle connector as set forth in claim 
1 wherein the plurality of stoppers are formed in a unitary 

member which fits within a recess (11) in the elongated 
housing. 
A receptacle connector as set forth in claim 
1 wherein the terminals are press-fit into the stoppers to 

form a single terminal-and-stopper assembly and the 
stoppers retain the terminals in their proper position 

within the housing.  
 
A receptacle connector as set forth in claim 
2 wherein the two rows of terminals are defined by an upper 

row of terminals and a lower row of terminals which are 
adapted to straddle a printed circuit board (5) of the IC 

card. 
A receptacle connector as set forth in claim 
1 wherein each terminal includes a terminal contact (2a) at 

one end thereof and a conductor extension (26) which 
extends from the terminal contact, wherein the respective 

stopper is located along the conductor extension (26) 
proximate the joint between the terminal contact and the 

conductor extension.  
 
A method of fabricating a receptacle 
connector for an IC card, the receptacle connector 

including an elongated housing (1) having a plurality of 
terminal-receiving cavities (4) extending therethrough, a 

plurality of terminals (2) in the form of a terminal strip 
and adapted for positioning within the terminal-receiving 

cavities (4), and a plurality of stoppers (3) each 
corresponding to one of the plurality of terminals and 

adapted to be press-fit within the housing, the method 
comprising the steps of: 


a) overmolding the strip of terminals to the 
stoppers to provide a unitary terminal-and-stopper 

assembly; 
b) inserting the terminal-and-stopper assembly 
into the housing so that each of the plurality of terminals 

is positioned within a corresponding terminal-receiving 
cavity; and 
c) fixing the stoppers within a recess in the 
housing wherein the terminals are properly positioned 

within the housing to receive the mating pins of a mating 
connector and wherein the terminal-receiving cavities are 

each sealed at one end by a corresponding stopper to 
prevent the ingress of foreign substances therethrough.
