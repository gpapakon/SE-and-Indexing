<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for a paper or board 
machine, said apparatus including a 

pressure-tight chamber. The chamber is 
adapted cross-directionally to the 

travel of a wire, felt or similar fabric 
so as to essentially extend over said 

fabric. The invention is characterized 
by having the pressure-tight chamber 

adapted to include a roll (1) with an at 
least partially permeable shell. The 

roll shell surface is advantageously 
formed by a fabric, furthermore, the 

roll is appropriately free-rotating 
mounted in bearings at both ends of roll 

shaft. The invention is further 
characterized by having the pressure-tight 

chamber operated with an over- or 
underpressure relative to the ambient 

pressure about the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus in accordance 
with the preamble of claim 1 for use in a paper/board 
machine. Conventionally, water removal in the wire section has taken 
place by means of gravity, table rolls, hydrofoils, vacuum 
foil boxes, flat suction boxes, centrifugal force and 
moving vacuum rubber belts. As a rule, all paper/board 
machines employ a combination of the above-mentioned water 
removal methods. The functions of the wire section have been characterized 
by the concomitant increase of the wire section frictional 
load with the increase of the machine speed as higher 
vacuum is required due to the need for keeping the solids 
at a constant level. However, this results in running 
problems and intermittent stops of the wire section. 
A major portion of the frictional wire load occurs in the 
region of the wet suction box, where the wire is sucked 
against the suction box surface with a high force that is 
exerted over a large area. The flat suction box has a limited water removal capability. 
Its effect can be increased by using a higher vacuum, 
whereby also the friction between the box cover surface and 
the wire increases, which results in greater wire wear and 
shorter life. The friction sets the limit to the maximum 
usable vacuum in the box. If the vacuum is above a certain 
limit, the wire stops from moving. In paper machines 
arming the sheet from pulp containing carbonate filler, 
the elevated friction causes rapid wire wear. Moving vacuum belts made from rubber (e.g., Rotabelt, 
FLO-VAC) are capable of eliminating the friction caused by 
the vacuum, but the high vacuum employed results in sheet  
 
marking by the slot pattern of the belt. Rubber belts are 
extremely costly and difficult to service. Moreover, they 
are problematic to drive. Felt suction box is a typical felt conditioner. Its operation 
requires a vacuum of 5-6 mHâ‚‚O, which must be accomplished 
using suction pumps. The felt suction box causes 
rather heavy felt wear on the side supporting the web and 
results in unnecessarily premature felt changes. The amount 
of air flow through the suction box is crucial to the conditioning 
result. In new felts the air is freely sucked 
through the felt, but with the gradual plugging of the 
felt, the amount of air passing through the felt is 
reduced. Then, the water removal capability of the felt 
conditioner is impaired as the amount of air sucked through 
the felt is no longer sufficient to remove all water from 
the felt. To overcome the above-described
