<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for producing a high purity nitrogen vapour product from 
the rectification of air within high and low pressure columns 24 and 26 

respectively, operatively associated with one another by a condenser-reboiler 28. 
The high pressure column incorporates a sufficient number of theoretical stages to 

produce a high purity nitrogen vapour which downstream of being condensed in 
the condenser-reboiler 28, serves partially to condense in a heat exchanger 42 a 

lower purity nitrogen fraction produced at the top the low pressure column 26. In 
such service, the condensed, high purity nitrogen vapour is at least partially 

vaporized and utilized as a product stream. Since there is intermixing with the high 
purity nitrogen produced within the high pressure column 24 and the lower purity 

nitrogen vapour produced in the low pressure column 26, the low pressure column 
26 can incorporate fewer theoretical stages and therefore can be built at less 

expense than similar air separation plants of the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air separation process and apparatus for 
producing high purity nitrogen. In such a process and apparatus compressed, 
purified, and cooled air is typically separated in an air separation unit 
incorporating high and low pressure columns. Many industrial processes require high purity nitrogen. For instance, the 
semiconductor industry uses high purity nitrogen as, for example, a carrier gas, 
a drying gas, an inerting gas, and etc. High purity nitrogen is produced through 
the cryogenic distillation or rectification of the air in one or more columns. 
When oxygen production is also required, an air separation unit is utilized that 
has high and low pressure columns operatively associated with one another in a 
heat transfer relationship by a condenser- reboiler. In such apparatus, air 
downstream of having been compressed, purified and cooled to near dewpoint 
temperatures is introduced into the bottom of the high pressure column. In 
either of the columns, contacting elements such as trays, plates, packing, either 
structured or random, are used to bring an ascending vapour phase into intimate 
contact with a descending liquid phase. As a result of such contact, the 
ascending vapour phase has an ever increasing nitrogen concentration as it 
ascends within the column and the descending liquid phase has an ever 
increasing oxygen concentration as it descends within the column. In the high 
pressure column, an oxygen-enriched liquid is produced at the bottom of the 
column and a high purity nitrogen vapour is produced at the top. The high 
purity nitrogen vapour tower overhead is condensed against boiling liquid 
oxygen produced within the low pressure column to supply reflux for both the 
high and low pressure columns. In order to utilize the high purity nitrogen vapour to supply reflux to the low 
pressure column, the low pressure column must also produce a high purity 
nitrogen vapour product and as such, the low pressure column must incorporate 
a sufficient height of packing or a sufficient number of trays or plates to 
produce the required nitrogen refinement. Thus, part of the initial capitalization 
of a double column high purity nitrogen plant is expended in the construction of 
a low pressure column designed to produce high purity nitrogen.  As will be discussed, the present invention provides a process and apparatus for 
producing a high purity nitrogen product through the separation of air in a 
double column air separation unit that does not require the
