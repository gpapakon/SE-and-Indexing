Process for the production of microparticles, 
characterised in that
 monomeric
cyanoacrylate is dispersed in an acidic, gas-saturated, aqueous solution optionally

containing at least one surface-active substance, the particles obtained after dispersion
for from 5 minutes to 3 hours are isolated, optionally washed with water, then

taken up in a pharmaceutically acceptable suspension medium and freeze-dried.
Process for the production of microparticles, 
characterised in that
 a polyester of
an α-, β- or γ-hydroxycarboxylic acid, optionally together with a water-dispersible

emulsifier, is dissolved in a physiologically harmless solvent, and that solution is
added, with dispersion, to a gas-containing liquid that contains, it the emulsifier has

not already been added together with the polyester, a water-dispersible emulsifier,
the particles obtained alter dispersion for from 30 minutes to 2 hours are isolated,

optionally washed with water, then taken up in a pharmaceutically acceptable
suspension medium and freeze-dried.
Microparticles obtainable by the process mentioned in claim 1.
Microparticles obtainable by the process mentioned in claim 2. 
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the pH value of the aqueous solution is from 1.8 to 4.5.
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 5, 
characterised
in that
 hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid is used to adjust the pH value.
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 polysorbates, octyl or nonyl phenols, macrogol glycerol esters or cetamacrogols
or substances from the group of the Poloxamers® or mixtures thereof are used

as the surface-active substances.
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 2, 
characterised
in that
 phosphatidylcholine or sucrose-patmitate-stearate 15 or mixtures thereof
is(are) used as water-dispersible emulsifier(s).
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 2, 
characterised
in that
 a lower alcohol, preferably ethyl alcohol, is used as the physiologically
harmless solvent for the polyester.
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 2, 
characterised
in that
 water or 87 % glycerol is used as the gas-containing liquid. 
Process for the production of microparticles according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 there is used as the suspension medium water for injection purposes
optionally with the addition of sodium chloride and/or glucose and/or mannitol and/or

lactose, which optionally contains, in addition, a surface-active substance according
to claim 13 and/or a polyhydric alcohol.
Ultrasound contrast medium, 
characterised in that
 the microparticles according
to claim 3 or 4 are resuspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable suspension

medium.
Ultrasound contrast medium according to claim 12, 
characterised in that
 there is
used as the pharmaceutically acceptable suspension medium water for injection

purposes which optionally contains an addition of sodium chloride, glucose, mannitol
and/or lactose and optionally, in addition, a surface-active substance according

to claim 7 and/or a polyhydric alcohol.
Ultrasound contrast medium capable of being produced by the process described
in claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 final freeze-drying is dispensed with.
