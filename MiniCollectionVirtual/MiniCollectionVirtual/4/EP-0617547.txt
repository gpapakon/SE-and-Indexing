<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of adjusting an imager in an electrophotographic printing 
machine to correct for registration errors when forming a composite image. Registration errors 

are sensed by forming one or more target lines (30) on the photoreceptor (17) surface, 
detecting the centre of the lines and controlling the operation of the imager in response 

thereto. In one embodiment, four LED print bars (10A,12A,14A,16A) form a composite color 
image in a single pass. A photosensor (40,42,44) is placed beneath the print bars; a narrow 

target line (30) is formed on the belt surface a few scan lines before the start (23) of an 
exposure frame. The centre of the line is detected by circuitry (Figs 4,5) connected to the 

photosensor output which produces a signal (Fig. 10) corresponding to detection of the centre 
of the target line (30). This output signal is generated for each of the three downstream print 

bars (12A,14A,16A) and a signal is applied to each print bar to start the image exposure 
sequence in registration with first image exposure (I₁). In a second embodiment (Fig.6), skew 

registration adjustments are enabled by forming two line marks (30;30') at opposite ends of 
the photoreceptor (17), detecting the centre of each mark and making the adjustments of the 

position of the downstream print bars (12A,14A,16A) based on time differences between 

detection of the centre of the two marks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an image forming apparatus, and, more
particularly, to an apparatus incorporating a photoreceptor belt having line indicia on the
surface thereof whose location must be precisely detected for image registration purposes.High speed copiers and digital printer machines typically employ a photoreceptor
belt as the imaging media since the belt can provide significantly more area to form a plurality
of latent images during a single pass or revolution when compared to a machine with a
photoreceptor drum as the imaging surface. The position of the belt during operation must be
known with a great deal of precision since the system timing control must ensure that the
images are formed within preselected frames on the photoreceptor surface and exposure must
be coordinated with the development, transfer and paper feeding functions. This is especially
true for color printing machines. Positional errors occur because the belt is subject to changes
in physical size and its rotational speed may vary because of mechanical wear and mechanical
tolerances in the drive components. Various techniques have been developed in the prior art
to compensate for these errors. These techniques include measurement of the movement of
the belt in some fashion so that images are formed at the same relative location from
revolution to revolution.One technique uses holes formed in the belt at a predetermined distance outside of
the image exposure frame. The passage of the holes through the viewing nip comprising a
light source and a sensor generates an output signal which is used for registration purposes.Formation of belt holes has disadvantages in that is reduces the structural integrity of
the belt and requires an extra process step when forming the belt. One alternative method is
to form registration marks on the surface of the belt, either at manufacture or by exposing the
belt in a non-image area with a target mark and developing the mark with toner. The mark
can then be sensed through the photoreceptor belt. The marker, rather than the hole, is then
sensed. This technique requires a partially, light transmissive type of photoreceptor.US-A-4,912,491 discloses an apparatus for forming superimposed images and
registration marks corresponding to the position of the images associated therewith. The
registration marks are formed apart from the imaging portion of the medium in a transparent
area to be illuminated from the opposite side of the belt. Detectors sense the position of the
registration
