<DESCRIPTION>
The use of compounds comprising solid-vapor compositions
formed by adsorption, sometimes referred to as absorption, of
gas molecules on a solid adsorbent as heat pump working
materials is known in the art. Heat pump systems using such
materials have a number of advantages over other heat pumps
for residential and commercial space conditioning, industrial
heat pumping and refrigeration. Such advantages include
higher temperature lift created by the solid-vapor media as
compared to other sorption media thus eliminating the need for
cooling towers or lift staging. Moreover, the apparatus used
for the solid-vapor compound heat pumps require few, if any,
moving parts, resulting in simple and reliable hardware.
Additionally, such systems do not use the objectionable CFC's.The solid-vapor compounds suitable for heat pumps include
complex compounds which are materials which adsorb molecules
of gas to form coordinative bonds in which the gaseous
reactant coordinates via electron displacement with the solid
adsorbent, commonly a solid metal inorganic salt. The
adsorption/desorption process releases significant heat during
adsorption and adsorbs energy during the desorption phase.
Unlike most other sorption processes, the entire adsorption or
desorption reactions may occur at constant temperature, thus
eliminating problems with hot and cold sorber end. Useful
gaseous reactants include water, ammonia, methanol and the
like. A number of such materials are described in U.S.
patents 4,822,391 and 4,848,994.Heat activated heat pumps consist of a heat engine
subsystem which generates high pressure refrigerant vapor,
essentially a thermal compressor, and a heat pump subsystem
which uses high pressure refrigerant to produce cooling or
heat pumping. The thermal compressor, heat pump, and their
combination in a heat activated heat pump comprise useful 
thermodynamic systems which make advantageous use of solid-gas
reactions. In U.S. Patents No. 5 027 607 and 5,079,928 (published after the priority date of the present application) there are described
apparatus and methods using constant pressure staging
techniques resulting in improved heat activated heat pump
systems. It is an object of the present invention to use such
reactions and staging techniques to even greater advantage and
efficiency.In the present invention as defined in claims 1 and 16, there is provided
a vapor recuperator and preferably, a liquid subcooler.
The vapor recuperator
is used with a system incorporating a refrigerant condenser
and evaporator, or
