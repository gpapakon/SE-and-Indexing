<ABSTRACT>
A signal characteristic variation apparatus for a high 
definition VCR in which a characteristic of a video signal 

transmitted is varied according to characteristics of a tape 
and a channel. A predetermined frequency band of test signal 

is recorded and played back on/from the tape for 
discrimination of the tape and channel characteristics in a 

recording mode. Therefore, the video signal can stably be 
recorded on the tape with its characteristic adjusted 

according to the discriminated tape and channel 
characteristics. In a playback mode, the tape and channel 

characteristics are discriminated by detecting the test signal 
recorded on the tape. Therefore, the video signal can stably 

be played back from the tape with its frequency characteristic 
adjusted according to the discriminated tape and channel 

characteristics.
