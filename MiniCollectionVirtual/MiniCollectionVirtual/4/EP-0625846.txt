<ABSTRACT>
Laser color printers include multiple laser sources 
formed of either diode lasers or laser diode arrays 

emitting light beams of different wavelengths, and an 
optical arrangement. The optical arrangement 

independently processes each of the light beams to 
provide a separate predetermined sized collimated light 

beam, and then focuses and scans the light beams over a 
printing media that prints separate colors for each 

different wavelength of light. Where different sized 
collimated light beams are required to match a printing 

media, a separate zoom lens is used is used in the 
optical arrangement to independently reshape each of two 

orthogonal cross-sectional directions of a separate one 
of the light beams before being properly sized at the 

output thereof. Where only one of the two orthogonal 
cross-sectional directions of the light beams has to be 

reshaped, the light beams are collimated and combined and 
pass through a beam shaper which reshapes that cross-sectional 

direction of the light beams before the light 
beams are focused and scanned over the printing media. 

Where laser diode arrays are used to generate separate 
wavelength light beams, each of the light beams from the 

lasers of an array are formed and focused into a linear 
array of spots on the printing media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laser color 
printers, and more particularly, to laser color printers 
using multiple lasers or laser arrays emitting separate 
light beams of different wavelengths that are each 
optically processed, focused, and scanned over a printing 
media. In recent years, thermal transfer systems have been 
developed to obtain prints from pictures which, for 
example, have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronically generated picture is first 
subjected to color separation by color filters to obtain, 
for example, three color-separated images. The 
respective color-separated images are then converted into 
three separate electrical signals. These three 
electrical signals are then operated on to produce 
representative cyan, magenta, and yellow electrical 
signals which are transmitted to a thermal printer. To 
obtain the print, a cyan, magenta, or yellow dye-donor 
element or sheet is placed face-to-face with a dye 
receiving element or sheet. The dye-donor element and 
the dye receiving element are then inserted between a 
thermal printing head and a platen roller or drum. A 
linear thermal printing head is used to apply selective 
heat from the back of the dye donor sheet to cause the 
dye from the dye donor element of the printing media to 
be released to reproduce the image portion of one color. 
The process is then repeated for the other two colors 
using any known accurate registration technique for 
ensuring that the corresponding pixels of each color 
image are properly registered to produce a sharp image 
print. Another way to thermally obtain a print using the 
electronic signals described above is to use one or more  
 
lasers instead of a thermal printing head. In such a 
laser printing system, the dye-donor sheet includes a 
material which strongly absorbs light at the wavelength 
of the laser being used. When the dye-donor sheet is 
irradiated, the absorbing material converts light energy 
to thermal energy and transfers the heat to the dye in 
the immediate vicinity, thereby heating the dye to its 
vaporization temperature for transfer to the dye receiver 
sheet. The light absorbing material is generally present 
in a layer beneath the dye and/or admixed with the dye. 
The laser beam is modulated by the electrical signals 
which are representative of the shape and color of the 
original image so that each dye color is heated to cause 
volitization only in those areas where its presence
