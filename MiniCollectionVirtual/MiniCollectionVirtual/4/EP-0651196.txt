<ABSTRACT>
The invention specifies a connection for the mutually facing ends of thin-walled metal tubes (pipes), the tube ends being brought into mutually positively locking engagement. For this purpose, the end of one tube (1) is inserted into a rigid counter-tube piece (2), or attached thereon, by means of at least one circumferential, radially directed corrugation (10), the counter-tube piece exhibits, distributed over the circumference, a plurality of lugs (4) which are cut out of it and extend with their free ends in the direction of the end of the tube, and the lugs are bent, in the radial direction of the tubes, towards the tube and into the corrugation cross-section thereof.

<CLAIMS>
Connection for the facing ends of thin-walled metal tubes
(5, 6) of a circular cross section, in particular tubes of

stainless steel for lining chimneys, wherein the end of one
tube (5) with at least one circulating, radially directed

corrugation (3) is inserted in a rigid counter tube piece
(6), which is widened over its end region to the outside

diameter of the tube (5), the counter tube piece (6) has a
plurality of lugs (8, 14) which are distributed at least

indirectly over the circumference, are cut out of this piece
and extend with their free ends in the direction of the end

of the tube (5) comprising at least one corrugation, and the
lugs (8, 14) are bent in the radial direction of the tubes

(5, 6) towards the tube (5) comprising at least one
corrugation into the corrugated cross section of the latter,

characterised in that a thin-walled sleeve (11) of metal
with an outside diameter corresponding to the inside

diameter of the tube (5) is inserted in the end of the rigid
counter tube piece (6) and firmly connected (12) to the part

of the counter tube piece (6) which is not widened.
Connection according to claim 1, characterised in that
the rigid counter tube piece (6) is the end of a rigid tube.
Connection according to claim 1, characterised in that
the tube is a tube (5) formed in a flexible manner by screw

thread-shaped or annular corrugations.
Connection according to claim 3, characterised in that
the rigid counter tube piece (6) is a tube piece which is

placed on the end of an adjacent flexible tube and firmly
connected to the latter by, for example, spot welding.
Connection according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the sleeve (11) is connected to the

counter tube piece (6) by spot welding. 
Connection according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, starting from its edge lying opposite

the front edge, the sleeve (11) comprises a plurality of
essentially U-shaped cutouts (15) distributed over the

circumference and extending paraxially and into the widened
end region (7) of the counter tube piece (6).
Connection according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the sleeve comprises the lugs (14)

instead of the counter tube piece (6).
Connection according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the lugs (8, 14) are U-shaped.
Connection according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the counter tube piece (6) comprises a

plurality of paraxial notches (13) which are distributed
over the circumference and start from its front edge.
Connection according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the widened end (7) of the rigid

counter tube piece (6) comprises a plurality of openings
(16), which are distributed over the circumference, for

introducing a sealing compound.
