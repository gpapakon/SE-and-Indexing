<DESCRIPTION>
BOVINE PANCREATIC TRYPSIN INHIBITOR DERIVED INHIBITORS OFFACTOR XaFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to Bovine Pancreat¬ ic Trypsin Inhibitor derived inhibitors of Factor Xa, and methods for their preparation and therapeutic use.BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (also re¬ ferred to as BPTI or Aprotinin) is a polypeptide having 58 amino acid residues, with internal cross linking by three disulfide bridges. Fritz, H. and underer, G. (1983) , Arznei .-Forsch/Drug Res., .33.: 479-494. The amino acid sequence of mature wild type BPTI is shown in (I) .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Arg Pro Asp Phe Cys Leu Glu Pro Pro Tyr Thr Gly13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Pro Cys Lys Ala Arg lie lie Arg Tyr Phe Tyr Asn25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Ala Lys Ala Gly Leu Cys Gin Thr Phe Val Tyr Gly37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Gly Cys Arg Ala Lys Arg Asn Asn Phe Lys Ser Ala 

 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 Glu Asp Cys Met Arg Thr Cys Gly Gly Ala(I)In the mature folded protein, disulfide bonds are formed between the following pairs of cysteines: 5-55, 14-38 and 30-51.The crystal structures of BPTI or BPTI variants complexed with trypsin, kallikrein, trypsinogen, and anhydrotrypsin show that two loops of the inhibitor form the interface with the serine proteases at residues 11-19 and 34-39. Bode, . , et al. (1984), Eur. J. Bioche . , 144: 185-190. These residues are believed to be largely responsible for defining the specificity of the inhibitor for the target protease. In combination with the sequenc- es of serine protease, the affinity and specificity of the protease inhibitors has been suggested to originate from sequence variations on both sides of the protease-inhibi- tor interface. Creighton, T. E. and Darby, N. J. (1989) , TIBS, 14: 319-325. In the art, the sequence for such a substrate or inhibitor of a serine protease is often represented by ...-P4-P3-P2-P1-P1 -P2/-P3/-P4/-... , where P(P') are amino acids and the proteolytic cleavage site, in the case of substrates, is defined to occur between residues PI and PI'. Schechter, I. and Berger, A., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1967) , 21.'. 157. The bond between the P-carbonyl and the P'-nitrogen in substrate is often referred to as the scissile bond.The primary specificity for a serine protease is defined by the nature of the residue immediately preceding the scissile bond. The residue, PI, corresponds to lysine 15 in the wild type or natural BPTI sequence. Residues surrounding the scissile bond taken together with
