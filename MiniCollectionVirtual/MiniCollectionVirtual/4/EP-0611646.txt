<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel composite adhesive used to 
adhere coating materials onto a substrate wherein the substrate material 

and the coating material have significantly different expansion properties, 
e.g., thermoplastic coating materials onto cellulose based substrate 

materials. The composite adhesive comprises both a rigid adhesive such 
as an epoxy or acrylic and a laminating adhesive such as a rubber based 

contact cement. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the 
composite adhesive is used in preparing composite articles such as 

counters, sinks, furniture, profile edging, chemical resistant lab tops, 
showers, etc. In another preferred embodiment according to the invention, 

the rigid adhesive is applied over a narrow portion of the coating material, 
substrate, or both, preferably the exterior region of said material, and the 

laminating adhesive is applied over the remainder of the surface area to be 
adhered. By the techniques of the present invention, it is also possible to 

adhere together several individual articles of manufacture so as to create a 
virtually seamless appearance between the individual articles of 

manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for adhering materials
that have significantly different expansion properties as well as the articles
produced therefrom. In particular, the present invention employs a
composite adhesive comprising a rigid adhesive and a laminating
adhesive. This rigid adhesive and laminating adhesive are applied
separately to different portions of either the substrate material, the coating
material, or both. The substrate and coating are then attached to one
another in a permanent fashion. The present invention also relates to
composite articles of manufacture such as counters, furniture, cabinets,
work surfaces, profile edging, etc., which are made by the present
process.GB 1403185 discloses an elongate laminated member
having at least two adjacent laminations secured together
at a longitudinally extending interface between them by
adhesive means extending over part at least of said
interface, said adhesive means having different adhesion
strengths over different regions for facilitating
separation of the laminations at selected portions along
the length of the member.Research disclosure, Vol. 1991, No. 328, XP
000217923 discloses a method for achieving high initial
tack in a composite pressure-sensitive adhesive. The
composite adhesive is made up of both acrylic-based and
rubber-based commercially available pressure sensitive
adhesives. This composite adhesive system would be
applicable to flexible foams, labels and nameplates. The
composite adhesive may consist of alternating stripes of
acrylic and rubber-based pressure-sensitive adhesives as
well as other patterns. The rubber-based adhesive
provides the high initial tack to hold the part in place
initially while the acrylic adhesive provides the long-term
holding properties. This system is of particular
use on difficult to bond substrates such as coarse
surfaces or low surface energy materials. Laminate materials come in various types and have a wide variety of
end uses. One area of laminate materials that has been very active is high-pressure
decorative laminates or HPDLs. High pressure decorative
laminates are used in such applications as countertops (hereinafter
referred to as counters), desk tops, cabinets, wall paneling, furniture, etc.
There are about seven different types of HPDLs; namely, general-purpose,
post-forming, cabinet-liner, backer, specific-purpose, high-wear, and fire-rated.
Each of these types of laminate materials are usually constructed
out of a coating material such as a laminate, a substrate and
