<ABSTRACT>
A bread slicer using endless blades, in which finger 
holders holding fingers for guiding the endless blades so as to 

position the same blades can be quickly and accurately 
positioned, is provided. 
A plurality of endless blades (B) are stretched over 
between drums (D1 and D2). Fingers (4) are provided each having 

engagement pieces (3) for guiding each of the endless blades (B) in 
engagement therewith so as to position the same blade, and each 

finger (4) is held on the finger holder (1). The finger holders (1) 
are slidably put on guide bars (2). A spacer shaft (5) is disposed 

in parallel to the guide bars (2), and rows of plural spacers 
different in width are attached on the spacer shaft (5). By 

rotating the spacer shaft (5), anyone of the rows of spacers can 
be made to intervene between the finger holders (1). The spacer 

shaft (5) will be rotated after it is shifted by an air cylinder 
(9). By clamping the finger holders from both the sides to fix 

them after the spacers are made to intervene between the finger 
holders (1), the finger holders are fixed, with their intervals 

kept at the width of the spacers. Thus, the endless blades (B) 
are guided at those intervals, and a loaf of bread (P) is sliced 

to a desired number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bread slicer for 
slicing a loaf of bread to a desired thickness by use of endless 
blades as defined in the preamble of claim 1. After baking, a loaf of bread is sliced at a 
predetermined thickness so as to provide four, six or eight 
slices per pound, and then packaged as a product. A bread slicer which carries out such operation 
automatically is constructed, as shown in Fig. 5, such that a 
plurality of endless blades B are caused to travel as crossingly 
stretched around drums D1 and D2 spacedly disposed in parallel 
and a loaf of bread P is laterally conveyed toward these endless 
blades B as shown by an arrow, wherein the bread is sliced to a 
predetermined number by the edges of these blades B. For the purpose of slicing a loaf of bread to a 
predetermined number by use of the endless blades B as mentioned 
above, it is necessary to control these endless blades B so as 
to be set at given intervals, and it is also necessary to hold 
the travelling blades B at predetermined intervals. In order to 
hold the endless blades B at given intervals, as shown in Fig. 
5, such a device is used that an endless blade B is made to pass  
 
between a plurality of fingers 4 each having engagement pieces 3 
supported on a holder 1. For controlling the position of these finger holders 1, 
there have hitherto been advised various constructions. In an apparatus disclosed, for instance in Japanese 
JP-A-329,430/1991 of the present applicant 
and shown in Fig. 6, a finger holder 1 is held movably 
along guide bars 2, a guide 26 is disposed in parallel to the 
guide bars 2 and an engaging member 27 which can be freely 
engaged or disengaged with said guide 26 is attached on the 
holder 1. When the engaging member 27 gets engaged with the 
guide 26, the holder 1 is not permitted to move and therefore 
positioned at that position. Further, a screw rod 31 is 
disposed in parallel to the guide bars 2 and a nut member 32 is 
screw-engaged with the same screw rod 31. On the nut member 32 
is provided a turning member 35 which is turned by an air 
cylinder 36. By means of this turning member 35, the engaging 
member 27 is released from its engagement with the guide 26, 
whereby the holder 1 gets movable along the guide bars 2. When the screw rod 31 is rotated to move the nut 
member 32 under such a condition that the finger holder 1 is 
made movable along the guide bars 2, the holder 1 is moved so as 
to be positioned. This device is advantageous because it can 
be reliably acutated and

<CLAIMS>
A bread slicer comprising a plurality of endless blades (B) 
stretched over two spaced drums (D1, D2) for slicing a loaf 

of bread (P), fingers (4) attached on respective finger 
holders (1) disposed in lengthwise direction of guide bars 

(2) and supported axially movably thereby parallel to said 
drums (D1, D2) for guiding each of said endless blades (B) 

so as to position said blade, and a finger interval holding 
member (11) having plural spacers which are slidably displaceable 

on a rotatable spacer shaft (5) parallel to said guide bars (2),  
 


characterized by
:
 
   springs (12) which are interposed between the respective 

finger holders (1), each of which biases the adjacent 
finger holders (1) so as to distance them from each other;
 
   the finger interval holding member (11) having rows of 

plural spacers (6, 7, 8) different in width from one another 
which are slidably displaceable on the rotatable spacer shaft 

(5) parallel to said guide bars (2) and adapted so that the 
spacers (6, 7, 8) of each row of spacers can intervene between 

the respective adjacent finger holders (1), 
wherein the rotatable spacer shaft (5) 

can be positioned in such a manner, that the spacers (6, 7, 
8) of a selected one of rows of spacers intervene between 

respective adjacent finger holders (1) so as to set and maintain 
predetermined intervals of the finger holders (1); and
 
   a finger holder fixing device (13) being adapted to 

move the outer finger holders (1) towards and away from each 
other in axial direction of said guide bars (2), thereby 

clamping together and releasing the finger holders (1) and 
the interposed spacers (6, 7, 8), respectively.  

 
A bread slicer as claimed in claim 1, wherein an air 
cylinder (9) is provided for distancing said spacer shaft 

(5) from the finger holders (1). 
A bread slicer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
finger holder fixing device (13) has air cylinders (13) 

connected to the finger holders (1) at both ends, and said 
air cylinders (13) are respectively composed of a two-stage 

cylinder consisting of large-stroke and small-stroke air 
cylinders (14, 15) connected in series. 
A bread slicer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein some of the 
finger holders (1), at the ends of said guide bars 

(2), are held at an interval corresponding to the maximum 
number of bread slices, without springs (12) interposed 

therebetween, and said several finger holders (1) are made 
displaceable as a unit. 
A bread slicer as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
finger holders (1) at the ends are formed in an united 

structure. 
A bread slicer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the rows 
of said spacers (6, 7, 8) are composed of spacers (6, 7, 8)

from one another respectively, and having three kinds of 

widths. 
A bread slicer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
spacer shaft (5) is made exchangeable by another spacer 

shaft equipped with spacers different in width.
