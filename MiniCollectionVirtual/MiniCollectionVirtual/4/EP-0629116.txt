<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a cupboard carcass (10) comprising a moulded plastics open fronted enclosure having a plurality of integral external flanges (18, 20) extending along the sides (13, 14), bottom (12) and optionally back (15) of the enclosure in spaced planes extending normally to the open front of the enclosure through or adjacent one or more of which the enclosure may be split to provide a number of carcass modules. Each module so formed has an encirling flange portion around each line of split and the modules may be used to form lager carcasses supplemented by modules from other carcasses or smaller carcasses from a reduced number of modules with the flange portions of adjacent modules forming a joint between the modules.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cupboard carcasses 
and is particularly, although not exclusively 
applicable to cupboard carcasses formed from one 
piece plastics mouldings. AT-310,378 discloses a cupboard carcass formed 
from a number of individually moulded plastics 
components. The carcass components have peripheral 
flanges which abut one another and are held together 
by clips to hold the carcass components assembled 
together. This invention provides a cupboard carcass 
comprising a moulded plastics open fronted enclosure 
having a plurality of integral external flanges lying 
in spaced planes extending normally to the open front 
of the enclosure through or adjacent one or more of 
which the enclosure may be split to provide a number 
of carcass modules from which larger carcasses can be 
assembled supplemented by modules from other 
carcasses or smaller carcasses from a reduced number 
of modules with the flange portions of adjacent 
modules forming a joint between the modules; wherein 
the carcass is a one piece plastics moulding. In one embodiment of the invention the flanges 
may extend in vertical planes along at least the 
top/bottom walls of the enclosure to enable the 
carcass to be extended/reduced in the horizontal 
direction. In a further embodiment of the invention the 
flanges may extend in horizontal planes along at 
least the side walls of the enclosure to enable the 
carcass to be extended/reduced in the verticial 
direction. In yet a further embodiment the enclosure may 
have two sets of encircling flanges one extending in 
horizontal planes and the other in vertical planes 
whereby the carcass can be extended/reduced either  
 
vertically or horizontally respectively. Preferably the parallel planes in which the 
external flanges are formed are equi-spaced from one 
another. In the case where vertical flanges are 
provided, the flanges may be spaced apart 
equi-distantly between the side walls of the 
enclosure. In the case where horizontal flanges are 
provided, the enclosure may be formed with integral 
internal ribs on the inner faces of the enclosure 
opposite the locations where said external flanges 
are formed to provide shelf supports within the 
enclosure. The following is a description of a specific 
embodiment of the invention, reference being made to 
the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a front elevation view of a 
cupboard carcass adapted to be severable into 
individual modules to permit a range of sizes of 
carcasses to be assembled; Figure 2 is a section

<CLAIMS>
A cupboard carcass (10) comprising a moulded 
plastics open fronted enclosure having a plurality of 

integral external flanges (18) lying in spaced planes 
extending normally to the open front (16) of the enclosure 

through or adjacent one or more of which the 
enclosure may be split to provide a number of carcass 

modules from which larger carcasses can be assembled 
supplemented by modules from other carcasses or 

smaller carcasses from a reduced number of modules 
with the flange portions of adjacent modules forming 

a joint between the modules: characterised in that 
the carcass is a one piece plastics moulding. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in claim 1, 
adapted to be split through the centre lines of the 

flanges. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the flanges are of hollow section rib form to 

create extended abutment faces when split for mating 
with corresponding ribs of adjacent carcass portions. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the carcass is adapted to be split 

immediately adjacent to the flanges. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the flanges extend in vertical 

planes along at least the bottom wall of the 
enclosure to enable the carcass to be 

extended/reduced in the horizontal direction. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein the flanges also extend down the back wall of 

the enclosure.  
 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of 
Claims 1 to 4, wherein the flanges extend in 

horizontal planes along the side walls of the 
enclosure to enable the carcass to be 

extended/reduced in the vertical direction. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 7, 
wherein the flanges also extend across the back wall 

of the enclosure. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of 
Claims 1 to 8, wherein the enclosure has two sets of 

flanges one extending in horizontal planes and the 
other in vertical planes whereby the carcass can be 

extended/reduced either vertically or horizontally 
respectively. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of 
Claims 1 to 9, wherein the parallel planes in which 

the external flanges (18, 20) are formed are equi-spaced from 
one another. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in Claim 10, 
and in the case where vertical flanges are provided, 

wherein the flanges formed are spaced apart 
equi-distantly between the side walls (13, 14) of the 

enclosure. 
A cupboard carcass as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims and in the case where horizontal 

flanges are provided, wherein the enclosure is formed 
with integral internal ribs (21, 22) on the inner faces of the 

enclosure opposite the locations where said external 
flanges are formed to provide shelf supports within 

the enclosure.
