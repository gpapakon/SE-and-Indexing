<ABSTRACT>
An immune suppressive product prepared by injecting an allergen or a mixture of allergens into the body of milk-producing species. Said product being the milk or a polypeptide subfraction of milk obtained from the allergen treated host. The immune suppressive product(s) is milk and/or the polypeptide fractions contained therein, which is ostensively free of the intact allergen or allergens used for the treatment of the host. The immune suppressive factor(s) being a subfraction of the allergen used for the treatment. A method of preparing immune suppressive polypeptides from intact allergens, which involves injection of the specific intact allergens into a milk-producing species, collecting the immune suppressive polypeptide fractions of the intact allergens from the milk of the treated host. The immune suppressive milk containing said polypeptide fractions, and/or the polypeptide fractions obtained from said milk, are non reactive in animals and humans as allergens. Said factor(s), however, are highly effective in preventing or alleviating allergic reactions.

 TITLE OF THE INVENTION IMMUNE SUPPRESSIVE PRODUCTCross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/431,639, filed November 6, 1989 and a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/177,223, filed April 4, 1988; U.S. Application No. 07/431,639 is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Application No. 07/161,039, filed February 26, 1988; both U.S. Application No. 07/161,039 and U.S. Application No. 07/177,223 are continuation-in-part applications of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/001,848, filed January 9, 1987 which is a divisional of U.S. Patent Application No. 06/546,162, filed October 27, 1983, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/384,625, filed June 3, 1982, now abandoned.The contents of all of the above applications are all fully incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThis invention is directed to the discovery of polypeptide fractions in milk which contain peptides derived from allergens administered to a milk-producing animal. These fractions are useful in suppressing allergic responses in humans and animals. 

 BAC GR0UN0 OF THE INVENTIONThe allergic reaction in man and animals has been extensively studied and the basic immune mechanisms involved are well known. The generic name for molecules that cause an allergic reaction is allergen. There are numerous species of allergens. Common examples include plant pollens, bee venom, house dust, animal dander, and a wide array of food proteins. Many allergens are protein or polypeptide in nature, as proteins and polypeptides are generally more antigenic than carbohydrates or fats. The allergic reaction occurs when tissue-sensitizing immunoglobulin of the IgE type reacts with foreign allergen. The IgE antibody is bound to mast cells and/or basophils, and these specialized cells release chemical mediators of the allergic reaction when stimulated to do so by divalent antigens bridging the antibody molecules. Histamine, platelet activating factor, arachidonic acid metabolites, and serotonin are among the best known mediators of allergic reactions in man.The symptoms of the allergic reaction vary, depending on the location within the body where the IgE reacts with the antigen. If the reaction occurs along the respiratory epithelium the symptoms are sneezing, coughing and asthmatic reactions. If the interaction occurs in the digestive tract, as in the case of food allergies, abdominal pain and diarrhea are common. Systematic reactions,

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A composition, wherein said composition comprises an active non-antibody-containing fraction of milk, and wherein said fraction is produced by the process comprising:
(a) administering an allergen to a milk-producing animal ;
(b) collecting the milk from the animal of part
(a);
(c) filtering the milk of part (b) through a filter which excludes molecules of greater than 100,000 daltons; and
(d) collecting the effluent from the filtration of part (c) wherein said effluent contains said active fraction.
2. A food product comprising the composition of claim 1.
3. An oral vaccine, wherein said vaccine comprises non-antibody active polypeptides from the milk of immunized animals, and wherein said active polypeptides comprise subfractions of the allergens used to immunize said animals, said subfractions being present in said vaccine at levels efficacious in suppressing an allergic reaction to said allergen in a subject who is orally administered said vaccine.
4. A method for the production of an allergic response-suppressive pharmaceutical composition, wherein said method comprises:
(a) administering an allergen to a milk-producing animal ;
(b) collecting the milk from the animal of part (a); 


 (c) filtering the milk of part (b) through a filter which excludes molecules of greater than 100,000 daltons; and
(d) collecting the effluent from the filtration of part (c) wherein said effluent contains said active fraction.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein said milk-producing animal is a bovine.
6. A method for desensitizing a subject to an allergen wherein said method which comprises orally administering to said subject a food product, in an amount and for a time sufficient to produce an allergic response-suppressive effect in said subject against said allergen, wherein said food product comprises allergic response-suppressive amounts of active, non-antibody polypeptides from the milk of milk- producing, immunized animals wherein said animals have been immunized against said allergens.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein said food product is selected from the group consisting of mi-Ik, skim milk, yogurt, and cheese.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein said food product is in powdered form.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein said food product is in liquid form.
