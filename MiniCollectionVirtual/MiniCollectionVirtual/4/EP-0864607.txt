<ABSTRACT>
A high modulus composition based on a mixture of
a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber which

has been modified with either zinc methacrylate or a
combination of zinc oxide and methacrylic acid and an

unmodified hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber
for use in high load-bearing synchronous drive belts

and belts made therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high modulus elastomeric
composition particularly suited for use in high load-bearing
synchronous drive belts.The use of hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene (HNBR)
rubber in belts, particularly for automotive use, has been
suggested in the past. See e.g. articles by Trevor A.
Brown: "Compounding for Maximum Heat Resistance and Load
Bearing Capacity in HNBR Belts", Rubber World magazine,
October 1993, page 53, and "Using HNBR to Improve Belt
Compounds", Rubber & Plastics News, June 7, 1993, page 45.
See also US-A- 5,405,690. There are, however, no
suggestions on what the composition should be.Fujiwara, in US-A- 5,599,246 (& EP-A-674 121),
discloses using a modified HNBR, specifically using the
ZSC-2295, in a belt composition. The modified HNBR is
blended with unmodified HNBR, blending 10-40 ppw of the
modified HNBR with 90-60 ppw of unmodified HNBR so that the
amount of zinc methacrylate is between 4 to 20 percent of
the rubber compound. Fujiwara teaches that if the amount
of zinc methacrylate becomes greater than 20 ppw of the
total rubber composition, fatigue of the tensile body
occurs.In accordance with the practice of the present
invention, there is provided an elastomeric composition
and a power transmission belt produced from such as defined
in the claims. A typical example of an HNBR modified with zinc
oxide and methacrylic acid is commercially available
as Zetpol ZSC2295 from Nippon Zeon Co. An unmodified
HNBR is available as Zetpol 2020, also from Nippon
Zeon Co.Typical of the peroxide cure co-agents are
trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trifunctional
organosiloxanes, triallyl cyanurate and triallyl
isocyanurate. While from 0.5 to 10 phr of the co-agent
can be used, 3 to 6 phr are preferred.Typical of the organic peroxides which can be
used with the invention are 1,3-bis(t-butylperoxy-1-propyl)
benzene, dicumyl peroxide and α,α-bis(t-butylperoxy)
valerate. While 0.25 to 20 phr of the
peroxide can be used, 1.5 to 4.5 phr are preferred.Typical of the phenolic resins which can be used
are phenol formaldehyde resins. Preferred is an oil-modified
thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin.
While from 1 to 20 phr of the phenolic resin can be
used, from 6 to 12 phr are preferred. It is believed
that the phenolic resin provides a high level of
adhesion to the reinforcement in the cured belts as
well as allows the belts to be built on conventional
elastomer processing equipment without the use of
solvents.In addition to those ingredients listed above,
the composition can
