<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of IGF-1 for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, the medicament comprising a subcutaneous dose not greater than needed to achieve an IGF-1 serum level characteristic for healthy individuals i.e. a physiological replacement of serum IGF-1. This treatment would be especially valuable for the treatment of children or adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and could lead to improvements in their pubertal growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of insulin-like growth
factor (IGF-I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment
of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the medicament comprising a
subcutaneous dose to achieve an IGF-I serum level characteristic
for healthy individuals, especially in children, adolescents and
young adults. Evidence for the efficacy of such treatment is
presented in adolescents with insulin dependent Type 1 diabetes
mellitus.Human IGF-I (hIGF-I) is a peptide present in plasma and other body
fluids. It has been purified from human plasma and the complete amino
acid sequence is known. The primary sequence comprises 70 amino
acids, including 3 disulphide bonds. Moreover, purified IGF-l:s from
plasma of other species show extensive sequence homologies to hIGF-l.hIGF-I can stimulate growth of a wide range of cell types. It has both
systemic and local effects and is present in the circulation mainly
associated with different binding proteins, six of which are sequenced
(IGFBP1-6). The binding proteins appear to modulate the biological
functions and availability of IGF-I variably. IGF-I analogues with
changed biological activities seemingly related to changes of affinities
to the binding proteins have been produced.
IGF-I appears to act mainly through the IGF-type 1 receptor exposed on
the outer surface of many different cell types. However, the relative
specificity of action may vary at the cell level, for example, due to
varying influence of binding proteins. The structures of the IGF-I and
insulin receptors are closely homologous, but binding of IGF-I and
insulin show only limited cross-reactivity. Because of the scarcity of purified plasma hIGF-I, there was a great
need to develop methodology for a commercial scale production.
Nowadays such large scale production of hIGF-I can readily be achieved
by using recombinant DNA techniques.IGF-I is primarily involved in mediating the somatogenic effects of
growth hormone (GH). As a result of studies with preparations of
recombinant DNA derived hIGF-I, it has been demonstrated that it
promotes skeletal growth and skeletal muscle protein synthesis.
Moreover, hIGF-I is also effective for the treatment or prevention of
catabolic states (WO 92/03154)).
In WO 91/12018 (Ballard et al.) the therapeutic use of IGF-I, or a
peptide analogue thereof, for gastrointestinal disease or the treatment
of the shortened gut after surgery was disclosed.
It has also been found that IGF-I improves the regeneration of
transected periferal nerves (EP 308 386)
