<ABSTRACT>
A digital photofinishing station (5) is capable of being loaded with
one or more distinct films in need of photofinishing. The digital photofinishing

station has the capability to identify the film and apply a specific correction
algorithm based on the identified film. More specifically, the digital

photofinishing station (5) is capable of handling films of different density forming
properties, process these films using a common developing process, and apply a

proper correction algorithm based on the type of film. Further, chemical
constituents of the developer solution in the development process can be

monitored, and based on known deviations in development caused by specific
deviations in the developer solution, a proper correction algorithm is applied. In a

further feature of the present invention, film can be developed and scanned at the
digital photofinishing station. When the proper correction algorithm for either the

film type or the developing solution deviations is not available locally, a remote
server can be accessed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing system and/or method
for processing and/or manipulating digital images. More specifically, the present
invention relates to the concept of updating photofinishing control software and
algorithms to correspond to specific film codes that require distinctive image
handling.In a typical digital photofinishing environment, films are
developed, scanned and/or digitized to yield corresponding digital images which
are then computer processed (such as for color balance, density, etc.) to yield final
digital images. The final digital images may be printed by a laser or other digital
printer, to provide customer service prints and/or uploaded to a remote hub for
later consumer access and/or copied onto a diskette, optical disk (Photo CD) or the
like.Parameters which the photofinishing processor uses to control (a)
the chemical processing (for example, development time in the case of
development of a conventional film, and contact time and temperature in the case
of development of a photothermographic film); (b) the scanner which scans the
film (for example, illumination control, degree of specularity); and (c) the digital
image processing of the digital images (for example, color balance), may
preferentially have different settings which depend on film type or history. For
example, images captured on film specifically designed for scanning may produce
poor images if handled by the scanner or image processor in the same manner as
conventional film images.Photofinishing processes are typically loaded with the appropriate
software and algorithms to control chemical processing, scanning and digital
image processing at set up and delivery. Software upgrades are made available for
loading by trained operators who much visit each and every site to reload and reset
the photofinishing processor. A drawback with the above procedure is that the software and
algorithm collection can be quickly outdated as manufactures supply improved
films with different properties, as improved digital manipulations become
available and as consumers request new and different image choices and features
which require changed image processing. While it is possible to manually update
the software and algorithm collection by supplying such code to trained operators
and having them reload the code, this manual intervention can be expensive and
difficult to implement on a recurring basis. It is especially troublesome when the
software and algorithms have a limited life and must be simultaneously
