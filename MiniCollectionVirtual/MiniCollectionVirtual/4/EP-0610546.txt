<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an antenna system for use in, for example, 
registration and identification applications. The antenna system includes a 

plurality of antenna loops which are adapted to act as single charge up loop 
antenna during a transmit cycle and individual antennae during a read 

cycle. One application of the invention is in automatic vehicle identification 
systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna system for use with a
registration and identification system as defined in the
precharacterizing part of claim 1.One example of a typical registration and identification system is an
automatic vehicle identification (AVI) system. The AVI system is used to
monitor vehicles for various applications such as for example motorway toll
charging, speed monitoring, access to restricted areas of only certain vehicles,
crime prevention etc. The AVI system typically includes a transponder on
the vehicle, for example the transponder described in our co-pending
application number GB 9220409.8 (TI-16821 UK); and an antenna system for
monitoring the transponder and to register the relevant information relating
to the vehicle on which the transponder is mounted. Two typical systems are
described in our co-pending applications GB 9220411.4 (TI-16817 UK) and
GB 9220412.2 (TI-17341). In AVI systems for monitoring motorway traffic
there are potentially many vehicles approaching at any one time. If for
example the system is being used for motorway toll charging it is important
that each vehicle is accurately identified and the relevant information stored.
For this type of application, it is necessary to have multiple antennae
covering the area. Generally, each antenna comprises a tuned Loop or LC
Circuits. The antennae and feeder cables typically need to be constructed of
litze wire and are designed such that the inductivity of the antenna is about
27µH ± 1µH.The close proximity of two antennae can cause dead zones in the area
to be covered. Forming a multiple antennae of tuned antennae would
produce an over critical coupled series of tuned LC networks which could
result in detuning of the individual antennae and heavy damping. Obviously
this would mean that the system is not capable of registering and identifying
all transponders in the field of view of the antennae. The problems caused
can, to some extent, be overcome by critical on-location antenna pre-tuning to
ensure that the resonant dead zones are minimised. This can be time
consuming, costly and inconvenient. An auto-tuning system for a tuned antenna system has been used to
solve the problem of tuning-on-location and detuning due to metal objects by
adding circuitry. This solution is expensive due to the complex circuitry
required.From EP-A-0 414 628 an electronic system is known including
a tranmitting antenna system and a receiving antenna system
having two or more loops each. Each loop of the transmitting
antenna system is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A transmit/receive antenna system for use with a
registration and identification system (10), having a signal

source and comprising:

a plurality of adjacent non-resonant antenna loops (14)
connected to said registration and identification system,

each one of said loops (14) laying in the same selected
plane, where one of said loops (14) is adjacent another one

of said loops (14), such adjacent loops being located such
that a first portion of one loop is located alongside a

second portion of an adjacent loop;

   characterized in that

said plurality of adjacent
antenna loops (14) forms a row that extends across at least

two adjacent and parallel pathways, each one of said loops
(14) associated with a single pathway and each one of said

loops (14) including a normal portion extending normal to
the direction in which said pathway extends and first and

second parallel portions extending parallel with or in
substantially the same direction on said pathway;
said antenna loops (14) are adapted to both transmit
and receive;
said system further comprises a switching means for
selectively switching said registration and identification

system (10) from a transmit to receive mode and from a
receive to transmit mode; and 
said signal source is connected to each of said first
and second portions of each of said plurality of antenna

loops (14) such that the field lines (20) generated by each
antenna loop are additive for said normal portions of

adjacent antennas and such that the field lines (24)
generated by a first portion parallel to a second portion

cancel each other so that said plurality of antenna loops
(14) act as a single large charge-up loop antenna during a

transmit cycle and act as an individual antenna during a
receive cycle.

(140, 140', ...) is driven by an associated amplifier (142,

142', ...).
The antenna system of claim 2, wherein the amplifier is a
class A amplifier.
The antenna system of claim 2, wherein the amplifier is a
class A-B amplifier (29).
The antenna system of any preceding claim, wherein the
switching means comprises a MOSFET device.
The antenna system of any preceding claim, wherein said
registration and identification system (10) is an automatic

vehicle identification system and said selected pathway is a
roadway.
The antenna system of any preceding claim, wherein said

signal source is a sine-wave source such that phase
synchronous signals are created at each of the individual

antennae.
