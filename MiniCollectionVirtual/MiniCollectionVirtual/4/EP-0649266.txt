<ABSTRACT>
A mobile radio network (PLMN) with a radio switching centre (GMSC) is proposed, to which a computer-controlled conference service device (SERV) is connected in such a manner that it balances at least three subscriber lines (1, 2, 3, N). To the subscriber lines, virtual subscribers (M1', M2', T1', T2') are allocated between which the conference service device (SERV) switches point-to-multipoint connections. To switch a subscriber conference, the radio switching centre (GMSC) switches point-to-point connections between real subscribers (M1, M2, T1, T2) and the virtual subscribers (M1', M2', T1', T2'). The conference service is only carried out in the conference service device (SERV), preferably under voice guidance by means of voice input and voice output devices (B). The conference service device is associated with a mobile radio subscriber number (TN 007), under which a subscriber of the mobile radio network (M1) or of a network connected to it can request a conference circuit.
