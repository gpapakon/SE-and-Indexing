<ABSTRACT>
A slot sorting arrangement for use in sorting 
postal items comprises an array of open fronted box 

units 9, 99 which are mounted in cantilevered manner. 
Each box unit 9, 99 includes at least one L-shaped 

dividing member 10 which can divide the unit vertically 
at any one of a plurality of positions along its 

length. A sorting bay is constructed from such a slot 
sorting arrangement which is mounted to a wall or frame 

11. Additionally, a further sorting bay is also formed 
when the above bay is constructed with a supplementary 

slot sorting arrangement mounted to a supplementary 
frame 111 set at an angle to the wall of frame 11.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
slot sorting for
example in the postal industry for the temporary
storage of letters and/or packages undergoing sorting.Sorting frames conventionally used in letter
sorting comprise a rectangular array of open fronted
boxes with each box being labelled in some way to show
the intended destination of the letters or other postal
items sorted to that box. On the assumption that each
destination box is to receive a similar number of
items, the construction of the array is relatively
simple and straightforward in that each box is
identical. However, it is usually the case that the
number of items per box is not similar and,
accordingly, a number of methods has been adopted to
allow for such variations. For example, where an
abnormally large number of items is to be routed to one
destination, the destination is allotted two or more
boxes, and for abnormally small numbers of items, two
or more destinations are allotted a single box which
may then require further sorting to separate each
destination. Alternatively, for a small number of
items, vertical dividers may be introduced into
particular boxes such that each destination box has
space generally for a maximum of two destinations, thus
allowing items being sorted to be placed in the array
in an appropriate box in a delivery sequence without
the need for further sorting.It has been found that the above-mentioned array
of boxes is not always ergonomically the most efficient
for the average or shorter than average height person
as certain boxes are difficult to reach, especially
from a restricted standing or sitting position.
Accordingly, improvements to such known arrays have 
been made whereby the outermost columns of boxes are
set at an angle to columns of boxes facing the person
performing the sorting function in order to assist
sorting. Indeed, columns of boxes intermediate the
outermost columns and the columns immediately facing
the sorter may have their dividing walls set at
decreasing angles to enable the person sorting to have
easier access to an increased number of boxes. The
sorter is thus positioned facing a bay with columns of
boxes located in an approximate curve.It has also been found that, even with the above
improvements, the labels for each box are often
difficult to see owing to reflective glare and
similarly the peripheral boxes of the array are often
difficult to distinguish from adjacent boxes owing to
distractions, caused by activities beyond the ends of
the array or the glare of lights.The known sorting

<CLAIMS>
A modular, open-fronted, rectilinear box unit
(9,99), for mounting in cantilevered manner in side-by-side

arrangement in a row with like box units to form a
slot sorting arrangement, comprising:


a back wall (39), a base (19) and side walls (29);
and
at least one planar dividing member (10),
removably mountable in the box unit (9,9) to divide

vertically the interior thereof at one of a plurality
of positions along the length thereof,
the back wall (39) having a plurality of dividing
member receiving sections (25,26), and the base (19)

having a plurality of dividing member receiving
sections (24), respective receiving sections of the

back wall and the base being in alignment with one
another,

the dividing member receiving sections (25,26) of the
back wall (39) being for receiving one outer edge of a

dividing member (10), and the dividing member receiving
sections (24) of the base (19) being for receiving an

other outer edge of a dividing member (10),
 
whereby a side wall (29) and an adjacent dividing

member (10) or a pair of adjacent dividing members (10)
between them define slots for receipt of items to be

supported on the base (19) of the box unit (9,99),
characterised in that
 the side walls (29) are
front-sloping

from the back wall (39) to the front
and the dividing member (10) is L-shaped to permit

easy sorting and removal of items by hand.
A box unit (9,99) as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the or each dividing member (10) is profiled

with deep front base (101) and back wall portions (103)
and a shallow back wall base portion (102).
A box unit (9,99) as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein the outer edge of the or each dividing

member (10) which is receivable in the back wall
dividing member receiving sections (25,26) inclines 

forward in an upper region thereof.
A box unit (9,99) as claimed in any preceding
claim, provided as a kit of substantially flat parts.
A slot sorting arrangement comprising a
plurality of box units (9,99) as claimed in any

preceding claim mounted in cantilevered manner in side-by-side
arrangement in a row.
A slot sorting arrangement as claimed in
claim 5, wherein the box units are mounted on a frame

(11,111).
A slot sorting arrangement as claimed in
claim 5, wherein the box units are mounted on a wall.
A slot sorting arrangement as claimed in
claim 5, 6 or 7, which is one of a plurality of like

slot sorting arrangements mounted in a vertical array.
A sorting bay comprising:

a plurality of slot sorting arrangements as
claimed in claim 5, 6, 7 or 8, arranged in rows one

above another to constitute a main sorting arrangement;
and
a supplementary slot sorting arrangement
comprising a plurality of rows of at least one said box

unit (99), each with at least one said dividing member
(10), and located at one end of the main sorting

arrangement such that the box units (9) of the main
sorting arrangement are at an angle to the or each box

unit (99) of the supplementary slot sorting
arrangement, the rows of the supplementary slot sorting

arrangement being in line with rows of the main sorting
arrangement.
A sorting bay as claimed in claim 9, wherein
a further supplementary slot sorting arrangement is

positioned at one end or at both ends thereof, at an
angle to the slot sorting arrangement thereadjacent.
A sorting bay as claimed in claim 9 or claim
10, wherein the or each supplementary slot sorting 

arrangement is mounted on a frame (111).
A sorting bay as claimed in claim 9, 10 or
11, further comprising further slot sorting

arrangements and/or supplementary slot sorting
arrangements arranged in a back to back arrangement

with respective slot sorting arrangements and/or
supplementary slot sorting arrangements, back wall

sections (39) of opposed box units being of sufficient
height to prevent inadvertent transfer of items to be

sorted through from one box unit to that behind it.
