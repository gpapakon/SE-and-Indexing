<ABSTRACT>
A dual-chamber pacemaker provides DDI pacing
with PVC-protected hysteresis and automatic AV interval

adjustment. An extended hysteresis atrial escape
interval (AEI
H
) is invoked in response to the occurrence
of either an atrial paced event followed by a sensed

R-wave (an AR event), or an atrial sensed event followed
by a sensed R-wave (a PR event). The occurrence of a

premature ventricular contraction (PVC) thus does not
trigger AEI
H
. In one embodiment, AEI
H
 is not invoked
unless the sensed AR or PR interval exceeds a prescribed

reference interval. In a further embodiment, the AV
interval (AVI) associated with the DDI operation is

automatically shortened following an atrial stimulation
pulse (A-pulse) delivered upon the timing-out of the

AEI
H
. The shortened AVI is maintained for a programmed
number of cycles of DDI operation, after which a

lengthened AVI is reestablished for one cycle. If AV
pacing follows after using the lengthened AVI, then the

shortened AVI is reinstated for a second number of
programmed cycles of DDI operation. If AR pacing

follows after using the lengthened AVI, signifying
intact AV nodal conduction, then the AVI is lengthened

to the programmed AVI over a prescribed number of
cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to implantable
medical devices, and more particularly, to
an implantable dual-chamber pacemaker configured to
provide PVC-protected hysteresis and automatic AV
interval adjustment in the DDI pacing mode.The basic function of the heart is to pump
blood (circulate) throughout the body delivering oxygen
and nutrients to the various tissues while removing
waste products and carbon dioxide. The heart is divided
into four chambers comprised of two atria and two
ventricles. The atria are the collecting chambers
holding the blood which returns to the heart until the
ventricles are ready to receive this blood. The
ventricles are the primary pumping chambers. The
pumping function of the heart is achieved by a
coordinated contraction of the muscular walls of the
atria and the ventricles.The heart is commonly thought of as having two
sides, the right side and the left side. Blood
returning to the heart from the body (legs, arms, head,
abdomen) returns to the right atrium. From there, it
goes to the right ventricle from which it is pumped to 
the lungs. In the lungs, the carbon dioxide collected
from the body is exchanged for oxygen.The oxygenated blood then travels to the left
atrium from which is enters the left ventricle. The
left ventricle is the major pumping chamber circulating
the blood to the remainder of the body.The atria are more than simple collecting
chambers. The atria contain the heart's own (natural,
native or intrinsic) pacemaker that controls the rate at
which the heart beats or contracts. In addition, the
atrial contraction helps to fill the ventricle, further
contributing to optimal filling and thus maximizing the
amount of blood which the heart is able to pump with
each contraction. Hence, atrial contraction is followed
after a short period of time (normally 120 to 200 ms) by
ventricular contraction.The period of cardiac contraction during which
the heart actively ejects the blood into the arterial
blood vessels is called systole. The period of cardiac
relaxation during which the chambers are being filled
with blood is called diastole. Atrial and ventricular
systole are sequenced allowing the atrial contraction to
help optimally fill the ventricle. This is termed AV
synchrony.A cardiac cycle comprises one sequence of
systole and diastole. It can be detected by the
physician by counting the patient's pulse rate. It is
also reflected by the cardiac rhythm as recorded by an
electrocardiogram. The electrocardiogram (ECG) records
the electrical activity of the heart as
