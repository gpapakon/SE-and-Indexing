<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in the formulation of the histamine
H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine, particularly for oral administration.Ranitidine, N-[2-[[5-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-2-furanylmethyl]- thio]ethyl]-N'-methyl-2-nitro-1,1-ethenediamine,
and its physiologically acceptable salts are
described and claimed in British Patent Specification No. 1565966, and a
particular crystalline form of ranitidine hydrochloride is described and claimed in
British Patent Specification No. 2084580B. In both these specifications there is
reference to formulations for oral administration, which may take the form of for
example tablets, capsules, granules, powders, solutions, syrups, suspensions, or
tablets or lozenges for buccal administration. Oral preparations of ranitidine are
also disclosed in British Patent Specification Nos. 2142820, 2198352, 2218336,
2219940, 2222772 and 2229094.Oral administration constitutes a preferred route for administering ranitidine.
Ranitidine, however, in common with many drug substances, has an inherently
bitter taste, and this constitutes a disadvantage with certain types of oral
preparation. Moreover, it is well known that patients may not complete a
necessary course of medicine if they are prescribed an oral presentation which is
particularly unpleasant to taste. The problems resulting from the bitter taste of
ranitidine are particularly acute in formulations such as chewable tablets.Chewable tablets are a particularly convenient form of oral presentation for
patients who prefer not to take swallowable tablets, or find difficulty in swallowing
them.We have now discovered a chewable tablet formulation which effectively masks
the bitter-taste of ranitidine and which also exhibits particularly advantageous
bioavailability.Thus the present invention provides the use of ranitidine, or a physiologically
acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a
minor condition where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity, wherein
the unit dose of ranitidine is in the range of 10mg to 150mg expressed as the
weight of free base. Chewable ranitidine tablets containing sucrose are described in GB2222772.
However, these tablets contain alginic acid and sodium bicarbonate as essential
components of the formulation and such tablets are excluded from the present
invention.Ranitidine may be employed in the tablets according to the invention in the form of
either its free base or a physiologically acceptable salt. Such salts include salts
with

<CLAIMS>
Use of sucrose as chewable base to enhance the bioavailability of ranitidine,
or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, in a chewable tablet, wherein the

tablet additionally contains a flavouring and, optionally, an intense sweetener.
Use according to claim 1 wherein the tablet contains an intense sweetener.
Use according to claim 2 wherein the tablet contains a peppermint
flavouring.
Use according to any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the ratio of ranitidine, or a
physiologically acceptable salt thereof, to chewable base is in the range of 1:85 to

1:15 by weight.
Use according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the tablet contains ranitidine
hydrochloride.
Use according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the tablet contains 10 to 800
mg ranitidine, expressed as the weight of free base.
Use according to claim 6 wherein the tablet contains 25 to 300 mg ranitidine,
expressed as the weight of free base.
