A key-lock for closing, notably of a door (11) of an 
electrical switchgear cabinet or enclosure, comprising a base 

(10) in the form of a plate for fixing to the door, a rotary 
shaft (13) extending perpendicularly to the base (10) and 

passing through an orifice (12) arranged in the door, said 
shaft (13) having an internal end (14) located on the inside 

of the door and an external end (17) located on the opposite 
side of the door, a handle in the form of an operating lever 

(19) of the key-lock having an end (20) articulated on said 
external end (17) of the shaft (13) on a transverse spindle 

(18) perpendicular to the shaft (13) and a free end (22), a 
locking part (16) securedly united to said internal end (14) 

of the shaft (13) and able to occupy a locking position and an 
unlocking position of the door, switching from one position to 

the other being brought about by rotation of the shaft (13) 
operated by the operating lever (19), a bolt (23) able to 

cooperate with the free end (22) of the operating lever (19) 
so as to maintain the lever (19), in the blocking position, in 

the position held down towards the base (10) and to release 
the lever (19) in the unblocking position, characterized in 

that said bolt (23) is pivotally mounted on a spindle (24) 
parallel to the base (10) and securedly united to the base 

(10) to enable movement from the blocking position to the 
unblocking position and vice-versa by simple pivoting of the 

bolt (23). 
The key-lock according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the bolt (23) is provided with a locking means (27, 28, 29) to 

hold the bolt in the blocked position. 
The key-lock according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said locking means 15 a cylinder (27) with operation by 

means of a key (28).  
 
The key-lock according to any one of the above claims, 
characterized in that the base (10) presents a housing (21) 

open in the direction of the operating lever (19) to receive 
with engagement said operating lever in the locking position 

of the locking part (16) and that said bolt (23) is arranged 
in the extension of said housing (21) being articulated on a 

spindle (24) transverse to said housing (21). 
The key-lock according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the bolt (23) presents on the part facing the free end (22) of 

the operating lever (19) a latching nose (25) against which 
said free end (22) is stopped at the end of the engagement 

travel to make the bolt (23) pivot to the blocked position. 
The key-lock according to claim 5, characterized in that 
said latching nose (25) cooperates in the blocking position of 

the bolt (23) with a retaining stop (26) of the engaged lever 
(19). 
The key-lock according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that it comprises a spring (30) urging the bolt (23) to the 

pivoted unblocking position to eject the operating lever (19) 
from the housing (21) of the base (10) when the bolt (23) is 

released and the operating lever is unblocked. 
The key-lock according to any one of the above claims, 
characterized in that it comprises a cover (33), slidingly 

mounted on the free end (22) of the operating lever (19) so 
that in the engaged position of the operating lever wherein 

this lever is blocked by the bolt (23), the cover (33) can be 
moved in the extension of the lever (19) to cover the bolt
