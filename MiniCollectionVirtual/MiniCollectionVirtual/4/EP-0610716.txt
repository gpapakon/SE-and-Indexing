<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for water inlet dispensing to a number of 
utilising 

elements in a washing-machine, specifically a laundry washer 
comprising a programmer (1), sensing means (3,4) for the different 

washing 
phases and connecting means (5,10) from the sensing means to a water 

dispensing element, the main feature consists in that said sensing means 
are obtained integrally with the programmer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for water inlet dispensing to a 
plurality of utilising elements in a washing-machine, specifically a 
laundry washer comprising a programmer, sensing means for the 
different washing phases and connecting means from the sensing means 
to a water dispensing element. It is known, for the existing laundry washing-machines, to have the 
washing agents and additives taken in with the water from the main 
that flows through the compartments containing said products before 
entering the washing tub. It is also known, for the intake of said products from the various 
compartments installed in the washing-agents dispenser (said 
compartments being selected according to the different washing phases), 
to feed water to the machine through water dispenser systems usually 
controlled by the washer programmer through a cam, a sensor and a 
return rod or through a lever-spring system. In said dispenser systems the programmer is fastened to the laundry 
washing-machine cabinet or control panel; subsequently the dispenser 
cam is assembled in a coaxial manner to the programmer along with the 
sensor. Said sensor is actuated by the cam profile and according to the set 
program it determines through mechanical returns water inlet  
 
orientation to the various compartments containing the washing agents. Both the cam and sensor are assembled outside the programmer, with 
the cam suitably keyed on the programmer shaft, whereas the sensor is 
assembled either on the cabinet or on the control panel. However, these 
systems cause some disadvantages, such as the large number of 
required components, namely the programmer, cam, sensor and 
fastening means for both the cam and sensor. Moreover, assembly of several components in various parts of the 
machine requires adjustments to compensate several coupling 
tolerances due to series production. As a matter of fact, if a number of components need to be assembled, 
the probability of errors on the assembly line will increase with 
consequent rejects of the finished product and repairing costs. The aim of the present invention is that of indicating how a device for 
water inlet dispensing to a plurality of utilising elements can be possibly 
obtained in a washing-machine, specifically a laundry washer, without 
the inconveniences of the known state of the art, but rather providing 
the advantages of low-cost manufacture and easy assembly. To this purpose the present invention has as its subject a device for 
water inlet dispensing to a
