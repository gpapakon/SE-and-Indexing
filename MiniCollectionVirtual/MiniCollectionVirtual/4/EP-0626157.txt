<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a gel shell splint for the hand 
which has an elongated support (12) constructed of an elastomeric 

material that is shaped to fit the center portion of a human hand. 
The support is releasably secured around the hand with the support 

being secured on either the dorsal or palmar side of the hand. A 
rigid shell (30) shaped to fit the center portion of the hand is 

releasably 
secured to the interior side of the support (12) and a compressible 

pad (40) is attached to the interior side of the shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a splint that cushions and protects a 
human hand following an injury, repetitive impact trauma, or pre- or 
post- surgical procedures. Surgery due to tendon, ligament, or bone repair in any part of 
the hand or carpal tunnel surgery in the palmar area of the hand 
frequently results in persistent pain in the area of the incision. 
Cumulative trauma disorder or repetitive impact trauma in the palm 
can also cause great discomfort resulting in incapacity of the hand. Pain and discomfort is aggravated as pressure is applied to 
the affected area during attempted use of the hand. Because 
patients tend to be reluctant to use their hand when there is pain, 
rehabilitation time is longer. Generally, scar tissue at an incision 
site becomes remodeled, softens and pain resolves over time. 
However, when a scar is formed in an area of the hand, individuals 
are extremely hypersensitive to touch or impact pressure on this 
area even when the wound is healed. Devices commonly used to protect the hand include elastic 
bandages and various types of padded gloves. Although they 
provide protection and support, these devices do not provide a solid 
barrier against physical contact or disperse the energy created as 
forces are applied to the hand during normal use. The splint of the present invention is designed to protect the 
sensitive and painful area of the hand while still allowing full motion 
of the hand and digits. Following surgery or trauma to the hand the 
invention allows a patient to start using his or her hand sooner and 
shortens the time required for rehabilitation by decreasing pain and 
preventing hypertrophic scar formation. Before describing the invention, definitions of relevant 
descriptive terms relating to the hand would be useful. The 
proximal area of the hand refers to the portion of the hand near the 
wrist; the distal area of the hand to the portion of the hand near the  
 
fingers; the radial side refers to the thumb side of the hand; the 
ulnar side to the side of the hand away from the thumb; the palmar 
portion of the hand to the inside of the hand at the palm; and the 
dorsal side of the hand refers to the back of the hand. The gel shell splint of the present invention solves the 
problems discussed above by providing a splint which facilitates 
healing by cushioning and protecting injuries or incisions in the 
affected area of the hand. The splint of the subject invention is 
generally formed of separate three parts, an outer support, a rigid 
shell, and an

A gel shell splint for the hand, comprising: 

a) support means adapted to cover at least part of the center 
region of a human hand; 
b) first securing means for releasably securing the support 
means to the hand; 
c) a shell formed of a rigid material shaped and dimensioned 
to fit in the center region of a human hand with a generally concave 

portion facing the hand; 
d) a pad formed of a compressible material shaped and 
dimensioned to fit in the concave portion of the shell; and 
e) a second securing means for releasably securing the side 
of the shell opposite the concave portion to the support means. 
The splint of claim 1, wherein the support means is generally 
rectangular in shape with a rounded end adapted to extend around 

the side of the hand opposite the thumb to the other side of the 
hand. 
The splint of claim 2, wherein the support means include a pair 
of narrow straps adapted to extend around opposite sides of the 

thumb to the other side of the hand. 
The splint of claim 3, wherein the securing means includes 
material having hook and loop genders of a fastening system 

attached to the rounded end and the narrow straps. 
The splint of claim 1, wherein the pad includes attachment 
means for attaching the pad to the shell.
