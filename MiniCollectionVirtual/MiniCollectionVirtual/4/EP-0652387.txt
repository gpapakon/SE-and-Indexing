<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for adjusting the brake shoes (2, 3) of an inside shoe brake with an expansion device (4) supported at a fixed point (6) on a brake anchor plate (1) and acting on the primary shoe (2), the primary shoe (2) being connected to the secondary shoe (3) by way of a floating adjusting device, the interval of which between its bearing surfaces on the brake shoes (2, 3) can be increased in order to compensate for brake lining wear. In order to create a simple and functionally efficient design, the brake application travel of the primary shoe (2), increasing due to the brake lining wear, serves in its return stroke as drive for increasing the interval of the bearing surfaces of the adjusting device.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the automatic adjustment of the
brake shoes (2, 3) of an inside shoe brake, having a

spreading device which is supported on a fixed point of
a brake anchor plate (1) and acts on the primary shoe

(2), the primary shoe (2) being connected to the
secondary shoe (3) via a floating adjusting device

whose clearance between its bearing surfaces (21c) on
the brake shoes (2, 3) can be increased in size to

compensate for the brake-pad wear by the brake
application stroke, which increases in size because of

the brake-pad wear, of the primary shoe (2) serving as
a drive for increasing the size of the clearance of the

bearing surfaces (21c) of the adjusting device, the
return stroke of the primary shoe (2) being able to be

transmitted via an adjusting lever (11), which is
mounted pivotably on the brake anchor plate (1), to an

adjusting wheel (15) which is arranged on a threaded
spindle (20) having opposed threaded sections (20a,

20b) which interact in each case with a spindle nut
(21a, 21b) containing a bearing surface for one of the

shoes (2, 3), and each bearing surface is formed within
a groove (21c) in the spindle nut (21a and 21b), which

groove engages at the end of one shoe in each case.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the adjusting wheel (15) is designed as a ratchet

wheel which, every time the ratchet spacing is exceeded
during the return stroke of the primary shoe (2), is 

rotated by one spacing by means of the adjusting lever
(11) stressed by a restoring spring (14).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the adjusting lever (11) can be fixed in a

manner disengaged from the adjusting wheel (15) by a
locking pin (24) which can be inserted into bores (1a,

11b) in the brake anchor plate (1) and in the adjusting
lever (11), respectively.
