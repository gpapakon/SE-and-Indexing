<ABSTRACT>
In a transmitter, information for transmission is received in the form of a digital signal, electrical or optical, which is converted into short signal fragments, each of which is assigned an index. A transmitter module (54) distributes this fragments to one or more receivers through a number of available communication channels (55, 61, 56, 60), the choice of channel depending on the capacity and availability of the particular transmision channel. In the receiver, the signal fragments are coordinated according as they are controlled by means of their indices, to produce a signal capable of generating an information display.

<DESCRIPTION>
Titel: METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATIONArea of applicationThe present invention refers to a procedure and a device for transmitting information, carried out by and comprised of a number of electronic modules and functions in accord¬ ance with the description contained in the introduction to patent claim 1.State of the artToday, substantial quantities of information are trans¬ mitted by means of electronic devices and networks. This information may be in various forms - written in the form of alphanumeric characters, as still or moving pictures, or as sound in the form of natural or artificial speech - and may be generated with the aid of devices such as printers, plotters, cameras of various types and sound recording equipment. Networks designed to transmit electrical or optical impulses across greater or lesser distances are used for transmission purposes. For trans¬ mission by this means, the generated information must be converted into an suitable train of pulses in accordance with the coding system selected for transmission purposes, while these pulses must, when received, be decoded to produce useful information, corresponding to that trans¬ mitted, for use for the intended purpose.Transmission and reception may take place in real time; in other words, coding may be carried out simultaneously with transmission and decoding simultaneously with reception. In many instances, however, the originally generated information may be stored in coded form in an electronic 

or optical memory, from which it is transmitted at a later time. In this case, the information stored in the memory often undergoes processing, such as readdressing or com¬ pression, allowing the subsequent utilisation time of the transmission channel to be shortened. The information may also be stored in similar manner at the receiving end for production in the desired form at a later time, following processing and/or decompression, if necessary. The informa¬ tion is usually stored on magnetically readable disks or tapes, or in optically readable, digital form (CD technology) .Clear distinction is made between a number of systems in the method of information transmission and storage describ- ed above. Thus, transmitters, receivers, transmission methods and networks which are completely different in technical terms are used to handle different types of original information, and for different application types and user groups.Information directed selectively to a specific receiver or a limited group of receivers is

Patent claims
1. Procedure for information transmission, whereby a signal carrying the information to be transmitted to the transmitter is generated in a transmission station, which signal is supplied to a communications system and, via the latter, is transmitted to the intended receiver or receivers, in which it (the signal) is used to generate a display representing the information used to generate the signal in the transmitter, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t several communications channels of different characters, such as a telecommunications network- and a broadcasting system, in particular a television trans¬ mitter, are made available within the communications system for transmitting the information from the transmitter to the receiver, in that prior to transmission, the signal is fragmented into time increments, which are analysed with respect to the time priority, addressing conditions, information content and signal character agreed between transmitter and receiver and, on the basis of which analysis, the signal fragments in question are transmitted to a correspondingly suitable channel based on its loading, cost structure and transmission capacity relative to the character of the signal, such as its frequency, as well as on the selective addressing facilities of the particular channel and the prevailing risk of unauthorised utilisa- tion, in conjunction with which each signal fragment is assigned an index specifying its position in time within the total signal representing the information, which signal shall be reassembled in the receiver from the incoming fragments with the aid of a coordination chart, in which each pre-assigned index corresponds to a specific position within the assembled signal which, furthermore, is con- 



figured so as to make it suitable for display, indexing and coordination charts being available in both transmitter and receiver.
2. Procedure for signal compression for the purpose of information transmission, whereby a signal carrying the information to be transmitted to the transmitter is gener¬ ated in a transmission station, which signal is supplied to a communications system and, via the latter, is trans- mitted to the intended receiver or receivers, in which it (the signal) is used to generate a display representing the information used to generate the signal in the transmitter, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t the signal generated from the information material in the transmitter undergoes compression, which may be carried out in an inherently known manner, following which it (the signal) is fragmented into short time increments, and in that, following fragmentation, the individual fragments are analysed to ascertain the feasibility of further com- pression, and are compressed in accordance with the results of this analysis prior to transmission.
3. Procedure in accordance with patent claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t compression of the signal before and/or after fragmentation is, at least in part, carried out using frequently occurring signal frames, which are recorded in a database, which signal frames are detected and replaced by indices specifying, in addition to coordination of the fragment positions in the informa- tion material, the complete signal content of each frame, whereby the database is available to both transmitter and receiver, thereby enabling the complete signal content of signal fragments indexed in this manner to be generated in the receiver. -:

4. Procedure in accordance with patent claim 3, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t the database for frequently recurring signals is divided into a base for standard information agreed between transmitter and receiver, which information is relevant to communication between the particular transmitter and receiver on most occasions, and a temporary database, in which signal frames occurring frequently during a transmission are temporarily recorded and indexed, and the content of which is trans mitted as part of the transmission in which they are to be included.
5. Procedure for security coding during information transmission, whereby a signal carrying the information to be transmitted to the transmitter is generated in a trans¬ mission station, which signal is supplied to a communica¬ tions system and, via the latter, is transmitted to the intended receiver or receivers, in which it (the signal) is used to generate a display representing the information used to generate the signal in the transmitter, whereby to protect the information from unauthorised access, address codes and/or authorisation codes and/or encryption pro¬ cedures are applied to the transmission, c h a r a c¬ t e r i s e d i n t h a t the said address codes and/or authorisation codes and/or encryption procedures are coded/ encrypted in a chart which is variable with time and/or with the utilisation sequence, which chart is available in both transmitter and receiver so that different coding/ encryption is applied on different occasions of communica- tion between transmitter and receiver.
6. Procedure in accordance with patent claim 5, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t, prior to trans¬ mission, the signal is fragmented into time increments, and in that each signal fragment is assigned an index specify¬ ing its position in time within the total signal represent- 


ing the information, which signal shall be reassembled in the receiver from the incoming fragments with the aid of a coordination chart, in which each pre-assigned index corresponds to a specific position within the assembled signal which, furthermore, is configured so as to make it suitable for display, indexing and coordination charts being available in both transmitter and receiver, whereby indexing for this purpose is coded/encrypted in a chart which is variable with time and/or with the utilisation sequence, which chart is available in both transmitter and receiver so that different coding/encryption is employed on different occasions of communication between transmitter and receiver.
7. Procedure in accordance with patent claim 5 or 6, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t the chart for varying coding and/or encryption is designed for most fore¬ seeable occasions of communication, the transmitter and receiver being programmed with the chart prior to commence- ment of the proposed communication sequence.
8. Device for implementing the procedure in accordance with patent claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i s e d i n t h a t it (the device) incorporates, in a transmitter, modules (32, 33) for receiving the information to be transmitted, in the form of a digital signal, electrical or optical, modules (34-50) for processing the signal, including a module (38, 41) for dividing the signal into short time fragments and linking these with coordination indices, and a module (54) for distribution of the signal fragments between a group of communications channels (55, 56) connected to the device, while adapting the choice of channel for each signal fragment to the character and priority of the fragment, to the capacity of the channels relative to the character of the signal and the trans¬ mission availability, and, in a receiver with modules (60, 


61) connected to the communications channels of the trans¬ mitter, modules (60-72) for processing the received signal fragments, including a module (68) for coordinating the individual signal fragments according as they are con¬ trolled by means of their indices, to produce a coordinated signal which, in further modules (72, 73) , generates a display of the information received originally by the transmitter.
