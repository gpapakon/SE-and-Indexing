<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing diglycerine poor in cyclic components by reaction of glycerine with epichlorhydrine according to EP-A 0 374 699. In order to produce diglycerine by a continuous process, the epichlorhydrine required for the reaction is introduced at several separate spots or reaction zones mutually separed in space in the direction of flow into at least one flow reactor, the reacted reaction mixture is largely freed or separated from excess glycerine in at least one evaporator and the remaining chlorhydrine ether mixture is hydrolysed in at least one first step with a 5 to 40 mol % excess alkaline carbonate solution, with respect to the organically bound chlorine in the chlorhydrine ether, in a pH range from 6.5 to 9.5, and hydrolysis is completed in a second step with alkaline hydroxide at a pH value above 10. Once hydrolysis is completed or practically completed, the raw product solution is set at a pH value from 5,5 to 8 with a mineral acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, and the resulting solution is condensed, precipitating salts are removed and the diglycerine solution containing less than 8 % by weight residual inorganic salts is freed by distillation in a flash evaporator from cyclic diglycerine and residual fractions of glycerine. Also disclosed is a device for carrying out the disclosed reaction of glycerine with epichlorhydrine.
