<ABSTRACT>
A heating boiler for the combustion of liquid or gaseous fuels consists of at least one intermediate member (3) arranged between two terminal members (1, 2), through which a heat transfer medium can flow. All members are made of light metal castings and are assembled together in a tight manner into a block (B) which forms a boiler body provided with flow and return connection pieces (4, 5) and having a furnace (10), heating air drafts and a combustion gas collecting chamber (12) with discharge pipes (9), in which at least the heat transfer surfaces located behind the furnace (10) are provided with heat transfer surface extensions (7). In each plate-shaped member (1, 2, 3) the cavity through which the heat transfer medium can flow consists of a pipe (6) or pipe system (6') formed, on casting, in the light metal body and whose flow and return connection pieces (4, 5) project out of each light metal body. These flow and return connection pieces (4, 5) are connected to flow and return collectors (4, 5) arranged outside of the block (B). The intermediate member (3) with an opening (10') which forms the furnace (10) is provided on both sides with a marginal connection projection (9) which extends around its circumference and whose ends are designed as gas-sealing surfaces (8'). Both terminal members (1, 2) are provided with similar projections on their side which faces the intermediate member.
