<ABSTRACT>
A metal cutting tool assembly comprising a rigid holder blade (1), an 
insert receiving slot (9) formed in a leading end of the holder 

blade and defined 
between a resiliently displaceable clamping jaw (3) formed integrally 

with the 
holder blade (1) and rigid base jaw (4) forming part of the holder blade, 

spaced 
apart displacement and supporting surfaces respectively formed 

in or on the 
clamping jaw (3) and the holder, and a slot opening key (21,33,41) 

a pair of spaced apart 
projecting prongs (24a,24b/34a,34b/42a,42b) 

of the key adapted to engage the surfaces. 
At least one 

of the prongs is displaceable with respect to the holder blade 
so as resiliently 

to displace the clamping jaw (3) outwardly with respect to the base 
jaw into an 

opening position for insertion or removal of an insert (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metal cutting tool
assembly according e preamble of claim 1 and as
known e.g. from GB 1 379 637. The invention relates
particularly to such a cutting tool assembly wherein the
inset is retainably clamped within the retaining slot
between a resiliently displaceable clamping jaw and a
rigid base jaw without the use of additional mechanical
clamping means such as clamping screws or the like.One known form of cutting tool assembly of
the kind to which the invention relates involves the so-called
"wedge clamping" of the insert in the insert
retaining slot. Here, the insert, having a single cutting
edge, is provided with a wedge-shaped body which is
forcibly inserted and is retained within a correspondingly
wedge-shaped retaining slot, the actual clamping
of the insert within the slot being effected by the resilient
outward displacement of the clamping jaw as a result of
the forced insertion of the insert into the slot. With this
type of cutting tool assembly, the resilient displacement
of the jaw is effected by the insertion of the insert into
the slot, but when it is desired to remove the insert, special
means have to be provided for mechanically ejecting
the insert from the slot, these means involving the
direct exertion of an ejection pressure on the insert. It
will be understood that both the insertion and removal of
the insert is accompanied by significant friction with
consequent wear on the blade jaws which are, in general,
of a much softer material than that of the insert.Alternatively, it is known (GB 1379637) to
introduce into and clamp an insert within an insert
retaining slot by first of all mechanically displacing outwardly
a resiliently clamping jaw, introducing the insert
into the slot and then allowing the jaw to spring back on
to the insert in a damping position. When it is desired to
remove the insert from the slot, the clamping jaw is
again displaced outwardly, allowing for the removal of
the insert. The outward displacement of the jaw is
effected using a mechanical key which is displaced in
frictional contact with the inside of the clamping jaw,
thereby leading to frictional wear of the jaw and/or the
key.US 402 400 is directed to a wrench for manipulating clamping jaws for saw-teeth
consisting of a stock having separated pins for engaging displacement and supporting surfaces in a saw plate
and bit holder.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a new and improved metal cutting tool assembly in
which the above-referred-to disadvantages are

<CLAIMS>
A metal cutting tool assembly comprising

a rigid holder blade (1)

an insert retaining slot (9) formed in a leading end of the holder blade (1) and defined
between a resiliently displaceable clamping jaw (3) formed integrally with said holder

blade (1) and rigid base jaw (4) forming part of the holder blade (1);

spaced apart displacement and supporting surfaces (14, 15), wherein the displacement
surface (14) is formed in said clamping jaw (3) and the supporting surface (15) is

formed in or on said holder blade (1);

said clamping jaw (3) having a leading portion and a trailing portion about which it is
resiliently displaceable relative to said base jaw (4),

and a slot opening key (21, 33, 41),
characterized in that

a first through-going aperture is formed completely in said clamping jaw leading
portion having an aperture rim constituting said displacement surface (14), and

said displacement surface (14) is spaced apart from said retaining slot (9); and

the assembly further comprises the slot opening key (21, 33, 41) having a pair of spaced
apart projecting prongs (24a, 24b; 34a; 34b; 42a, 42b) adapted to engage said surfaces

(14, 15) at least one of said prongs being displaceable with respect to said holder blade
(1) so as to resiliently displace said clamping jaw (3) outwardly with respect to said

base jaw (4) into an opening position for insertion or removal of an insert (7). 
The assembly according to Claim 1, wherein said
damping jaw trailing portion is coupled to a body

portion of said rigid holder blade (1) via a relatively
narrow neck portion (5) of a reduced height dimension

as compared with the height dimension of the
region of the clamping jaw (3) leading portion on

which said displacement surface (14) is formed,
said dimensions being transverse to a longitudinal

direction of said clamping jaw (3).
The assembly according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
a second aperture is formed in said holder blade

spaced from said first aperture and having an aperture
rim constituting said supporting surface (15).
The assembly according to Claim 3, wherein said
second aperture is formed in said base jaw substantially

opposite said first aperture and said slot
opening key (21,33) further comprises means

(25,28) for displacing said prongs (24a, 24b, 34a,
34b) apart
The assembly according to Claim 4, wherein said
means for displacing said prongs (24a, 24b) apart

includes a wedge-like spacer (25).
The assembly according to Claim 4, wherein said
means for displacing said prongs apart includes a 

fixed prong (34a) and an eccentrically rotatable
prong (34b).
The assembly according to Claim 3, wherein said
second aperture is formed substantially adjacent

said clamping jaw trailing portion, and wherein a
rotational movement of said key (41) about a first

prong engaging said supporting surface, displaces
said clamping jaw (3) relative to said base jaw (4).
The assembly according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
said supporting surface (15) is formed on an edge surface

of said holder blade (1) constituting a continuation
of the trailing edge surface of said clamping

jaw (3) and wherein a rotational movement of said
key (41) about a first prong engaging said supporting

surface displaces said clamping jaw (3) relative
to said base jaw (4).
The assembly according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
said supporting surface is formed as a trailing

extension of said insert retaining slot (9) and
wherein a rotational movement of said key (41)

about a first prong (42b) engaging said supporting
surface displaces said clamping jaw (3) relative to

said base jaw (4).
