<ABSTRACT>
A device for copying essentially transparent photographic originals (masters, manuscripts) (N) onto photographic copy material (P) comprises an original stage (document window) (1) on which the original (N) is transported to a measurement station (3) with the aid of first transporting means (T1, T2, R1, M). There, light is admitted to it and it is measured. The amounts of copier light required for the exposure are subsequently determined from this measurement. The measurement station is followed in the direction of transport by an exposure station (4) where the determined copier light amounts are admitted to the original (N) and it is copied onto the copy material (P). The device further comprises a transmission measuring arrangement (5) and a remission measuring arrangement (6) for measuring test originals or test copies, the transmission measuring arrangement (5) and the remission measuring arrangement (6) being provided in terms of construction in the region of the original stage (1) on which the original (N) is transported, measured and copied onto the copy material (P).

Device to copy essentially transparent photographic copying originals (N) onto
photographic copy material (P), with an original platform (1) on which the copying

originals (N) are transported to a measuring station (3) using the first transport system (T1,
T2, R1, M), where they are exposed to light and measured, and the copier light quantities

required for exposure are then calculated from this measurement, with an exposure station
(4) following the measuring station in the direction of transport, where the original (N) is

exposed to the calculated quantity of light and copied onto the copy material (P), and with
a transmission (5) and a reflection (6) measuring unit for the measurement of test originals

and test copies, characterised in that the transmission (5) and a reflection (6) measuring unit
are built in to the region of the original platform (1) on which the copying original (N) is

transported, measured and copied onto the copy material (P), in which the measuring
station (3), the exposure station (4) and the transmission measuring unit (5) on the original

platform (1) are arranged in immediate sequence on the transport path of the original (N),
and a common exposure device (7) is provided that covers the measuring station (3), the

exposure station (4) and the transmission measuring unit (5).
Device according to Claim 1, further characterised in that a transport system is provided
that comprises a drive motor (M) and that transports the originals (N) through the

transmission measuring unit (5), and that this transport system is formed of the first
transport system (T1, T2, T3, R1, M), which transport the originals (N) to the measuring

station (3) and to the exposure station (4).
Device according to Claim 2, further characterised in that a second transport system (T4,
R2) is provided, which transports the copies through the reflection measuring unit (6) and

that this second transport system (T4, R2) can be driven by the same drive motor (M) as
the first transport system (T1, T2, T3, R1, M).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, further characterised in that a detection unit (2)
is provided in the region of the original platform (1) in the direction of transport (F) to

detect the start and finish of the content of the test or copying original (N), followed by the 
measuring station (3), the exposure station (4) and the transmission measuring unit (5) in

sequence, and that the signals generated from these stations and units and those from the
reflection measuring unit (6) are passed to an electronic unit (8), and that a control

computer (9) is provided that reads the individual signals from this electronic unit (8) and
generates the appropriate signals on the basis of these signals read in, e.g. to control the

drive motor (M) or to control the quantity of light required, and/or processes measuring
data from the measuring station (3), e.g. calculates the quantity of light required to copy

the original (N) onto the copy material (P) from this measuring data, and processes the
measuring data from the transmission (5) and reflection (6) measuring unit and gives

information on the state of the wet chemical development baths.
Mini-laboratory to manufacture copies of photographic originals, with a copier station to
copy developed copying originals onto photographic copy material and with a developing

station to develop the copy material, characterised in that the copier station includes a
device according to one of Claims 1 to 4.
