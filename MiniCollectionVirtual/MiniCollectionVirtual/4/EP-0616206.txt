<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for measuring turbidity in liquid or gaseous media, in which the turbidity is determined by measuring the absorption and/or the scattering which are caused by pollution, and with which the absorption and/or the scattering is measured using an optical sensor. The disadvantages in known arrangements or methods consist in the sensitivity with which measurement is carried out. In addition, absorption effects due to colour cannot be distinguished from absorption effects due to contamination. These disadvantages are overcome by using an optical sensor consisting of a colour camera for the turbidity measurement. In the case of the arrangement according to the invention, the colour content involved in the light loss is determined from the RGB components of the signal received, by ascertaining the colour in comparison to a sample from the ratio of the colour contents to each other. The remaining light loss which is not caused by colour then provides the degree of turbidity.
