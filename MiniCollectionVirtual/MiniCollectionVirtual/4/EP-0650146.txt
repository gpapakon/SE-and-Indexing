<ABSTRACT>
Techniques for multiple verification of 
transaction cards incorporating digital image information 

and authorization data onto a transaction card to assist 
in the card verification process. This technique 

requires the authorized card holder to have a picture 
identification accompany the application for the card. 

Picture information is converted to a digital image that 
is stored and used in one or a plurality of means for 

verifying that the presenter of the card, at the point of 
the transaction, is the authorized user. Such means 

include visual comparison of card presenter and extracted 
digital image information and verification that the data 

has not been altered. Encryption of the data, as it is 
read from the card, at the point of origin is used to 

formulate encoded authorization data that is then 
compared against like encoded authorized card holder data 

stored at a centrally located data base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation of U.S. Serial No. 
08/019,538, filed February 18, 1993. The present invention relates to the field of 
transaction cards and to the verification of the owner of 
the transaction card. More particularly, the invention 
is directed to a method and associated apparatus for 
reading a transaction card with a digital picture of the 
owner or authorized user and multiply validating the 
authenticity of the card. Many types of transactions and access to 
services are authorized by the presentation of some form 
of identification/transaction/access card such as a 
credit card, debit card, voter registration card or a 
health care access card. Such cards will be hereinafter 
referred to as transaction cards. Many of these 
transaction cards have incorporated a stripe of magnetic 
material on which information has been written by the 
issuer of the transaction card to aid in either access to 
services and/or identification of the transaction card 
holder. Visual verification of identity plays a role in 
many types of transactions and security procedures. For 
example, signatures, fingerprints or images of faces are 
compared in to establish identity. The creation of a 
fraudulent identities or the misrepresentation of 
identity results can allow individuals to commit fraud 
and breach security systems.  One system which relies on verification of 
identity for transactions is the credit and charge card 
system. These cards are an increasingly popular means 
for consumers and validation requestors to complete 
transactions. However, part of the cost incurred from 
this convenience is the burgeoning growth of card fraud. 
In 1991 the estimated cost to the financial industry for 
credit card fraud was $1.58 billion. The cost of this 
fraud is paid for by the banking/credit industry, but it 
is passed to the consumer in the form of higher card 
interest rates and fees and to the validation requestors 
in the form of additional transaction commission fees. Methods used to combat this fraud have been the 
use of holographic images on cards, the need for 
validation requestors to obtain transaction approval, the 
encoding of cardholder information on magnetic strips on 
the back of the card, and signature verification. A 
well-known approach is to have image information 
available for visual verification that the card bearer is 
the authorized owner (see Luther G. Simjian, 
'Verification System using Coded Identifying and Storage 
Means," U.S. Patent No. 3,569,619, issued March 9, 1971)
