<ABSTRACT>
Roofcovering material, consisting of a base layer (1), onto 
which, under insertion of a separating layer (2), a bituminous 

covering layer (3) is applied, wherein in the base 
layer is formed by a supporting layer, by means of 

which the roofcovering material may be mechanically 
fastened to a foundation, such as a roof construction, 

and wherein the seperating layer is provided with

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a roofcovering material,
formed by a base layer, onto which base layer, under
insertion of a separating layer, a bituminous covering
layer has been applied.From EP-A-0 251 374 is known a roofcovering material,
formed by a base layer, onto which base layer, under
insertion of a separating layer, a bituminous covering
layer has been applied. The base layer is formed of
non-woven glass fibers and is provided with apertures
distributed over its surface through which molten
bitumen may pass to fasten the roofcovering material to
the roof. The separating layer is provided with perforations
through which a limited bond exists between the
covering layer and the base layer which is intended to
easily break when the roofcovering material is exposed
to stress as a result of the formation of cracks or
fissures in the roof.The known roofcovering material as described above has
the drawback, that this has to be applied to a roof
construction by heating the bitumen with an open
flame, which constitutes an important fire hazard. It
is not possible to apply the roofcovering material
mechanically to the roof, for instance by means of a
screw with washer plates or -strips, without the roofcovering
material to come to lie completely loose when
exposed to wind load.
The base layer comprised of the glass fibres tissue
tears easily, so that, when the roofcovering material
is exposed to windload, the base layer will break
down, and thereby the connection between the covering
layer, the base layer and the screwed connection will
be broken, resulting in the roofcovering material to
come to lie loose on the roof. The invention aims to obviate these drawbacks of the
known roofcovering material.The roofcovering material according to the invention to
that end is characterized, in that the base layer is
formed by a supporting layer, by means of which the
roofcovering material may be mechanically fastened to a
foundation, such as a roof construction, and wherein
the separating layer is provided with apertures,
through which the covering layer is firmly adhered to
the supporting layer, while the separating layer is
applied loosely or in spaced relationship over the
supporting layer or the covering layer, such, that the
covering layer and the supporting layer, outside of the
area of the apertures, are movable with respect to each
other, while the separating layer and the supporting
layer are compressible or foldable under an elastic
deformation of the covering layer.According to a characteristic of the
