<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluorescent lamp
which can ensure a color reproducibility at the minimum to
classify and identify the surface colors such as red, green,
blue, yellow and white which are basic colors for a
categorical decision of colors by human beings and realize
a highly efficient illumination light source with an
excellent visual brightness under a scotopic vision and a
mesopic vision.In a conventional fluorescent lamp, the design of
spectral characteristics thereof has been carried out by
evaluating the exactness of a subtle color reproduction for
a standard light source such as black body radiation or
combined daylight using an average color rendering
evaluation value Ra.On the contrary, the inventors of the present invention
put to practical use and develop the color reproduction 
characteristics that human beings roughly identify colors,
that is to say, a categorical color perception to evaluate
the exactness of the color reproduction, so that they
proposed a light source the design of spectral
characteristics of which is optimized (see PCT/JP96/02618:
Light Source, International Patent Laid-Open No.
W097/11480).This light source realizes a highly efficient light
source by mainly taking a visual efficiency under a photopic
vision into consideration, while maintaining the color
reproducibility for classifying and identifying
(categorical color perception) the surface colors including
red, green, blue, yellow and white which are basic colors
for the categorical decision of colors of human beings by
concentrating emitted light mainly to the wavelength bands
of green and red.This light source will be called a "highly efficient
light source," hereinafter.Since such a highly efficient light source gives
priority to the light emitting efficiency of the light source
while it satisfies a minimum appearance of color, it is mainly
employed for an exterior illumination. The above-described
light source is used for the exterior illumination, because
the high quality appearance of colors is not needed in the
exterior illumination as in an interior lighting and the 
light emitting efficiency of the light source is
preferentially taken into account.In the exterior illumination such as a road illumination,
a street illumination, etc. there is frequently carried out
an illumination with illuminance relatively lower than that
of the interior lighting.Further, it has been known that the visual cells of the
eyes of human beings include cones and rods, the cones operate
under the state of a photopic
