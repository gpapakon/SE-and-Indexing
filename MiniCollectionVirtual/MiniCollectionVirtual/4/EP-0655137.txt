<ABSTRACT>
A level measuring set for low frequency signals with superimposed direct voltage has a low-pass filter (7) to which is applied the measurement signal and whose output emits a reference potential (UB) which corresponds to the direct voltage. A measurement rectifier (2) forms a positive and a negative direct voltage component (+UM, -UM) superimposed on the reference potential (UB) for the positive and negative half-waves of the low frequency signal, respectively. The reference potential (UB) is applied to a reference point (6) of the measurement rectifier (2). A subtractor (5) receives at its input the positive and negative direct voltage components (+UM, -UM) and emits the level measurement value.

<CLAIMS>
Level-measuring device for low-frequency 
measurement signals with superimposed direct voltage, 

having a low-pass filter (7) to which the low-frequency 
measurement signal is applied and the output of which 

emits a reference potential (U
B
) which corresponds to 
the direct voltage, 


having a meter rectifier (2) for forming a positive and 
a negative direct-voltage portion (+U
M
, -U
M
), in each 
case superimposed with the reference potential (U
B
), 
for the positive and negative half waves of the low-frequency 

measurement signal respectively, in which 
case the reference potential (U
B
) is applied to a 
reference point (6) of the meter rectifier (2), and 
having a subtractor (5) to which, on the input side, 
the positive and the negative direct-voltage portion 

(+U
M
,-U
M
), in each case superimposed with the reference 
potential (U
B
), are supplied and which emits the 
measured value of the level of the low-frequency 

measurement signal.
