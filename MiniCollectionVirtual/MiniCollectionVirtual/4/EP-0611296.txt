<ABSTRACT>
A method of thawing of cryosurgical apparatus, and in particular a cryosurgical probe, subsequent to a freezing process involves the interruption of the cryogen supply to the probe followed by the introduction of a warmed inert gas. The gas is circulated within the probe cryogen circulation system to affect thawing of the apparatus so that the probe may easily be withdrawn from the body. The gas, which may be nitrogen, is preferably passed through a heat exchange arrangement before being introduced into the probe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns cryosurgical apparatus, and
relates in particular to a method of thawing a
cryosurgical probe subsequent to carrying out a freezing
process, in order that the probe may be withdrawn.Following an operation involving the destruction
of tumourous tissue by freezing with a cooled probe
inserted into the body, it is necessary to thaw or allow
to be thawed the tissue immediately surrounding the
probe in order that the latter may be withdrawn. Such
thawing is commonly carried out by one of two principal
methods. The first involves the use of latent body
heat. This has the serious disadvantage that the process
is extremely slow, thereby significantly increasing
operation times. The second method utilises electrical
heating of the probe tip. Although this is a considerably
faster method, there are inherent safety problems
which necessitate the utmost care in producing and using
equipment of this kind.The invention seeks to mitigate or obviate the
above mentioned difficulties by providing a relatively
fast yet safe method of raising the temperature of the
probe tip on completion of an operation. DE-A-2251626 describes a cryosurgical probe in which cryogen is supplied to a cooling
tip through an innermost tube of a concentric arrangement, and the exhaust cryogen gas is
removed through a second tube concentrically surrounding the first tube.Reference is also made to WO-A-83/03961 in which the use of x-ray computer
tomography is said to permit the monitoring of ice-ball growth using cryosurgery, thereby
enabling the cryosurgery of deep-lying lesions and tumours, and the optimisation of cryotherapy
of tissue close to the body surface and/or body cavities. This monitoring technique is
used in conjunction with special cryoprobes designed to have an attenuation co-efficient as close
as possible to that of biological tissue. The cryoprobes are constructed of low atomic number
metals and/or plastics and can be used with liquid nitrogen or liquid noble gas, especially
crypton and xenon.Reference is also made to SU-A-1217377 which describes a Joule-Thomson gas
cryosurgical instrument, and a method of thawing the instrument by using a gas of inversion
temperature below the ambient temperature, for example, helium, neon or hydrogen. The gas is
fed to the refrigerated head and, after passing through the Joule-Thomson throttle opening, the
expanded gas becomes hotter, to speed up thawing of the probe.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of cooling and
thawing cryosurgical
