<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the treatment of synthesis gas or fuel gas obtained by coal gasification, residue gasification, waste gasification or oil gasification, in which the gas stream obtained by gasification, which contains reducing and possibly inert gases, is treated for the removal of sulfur, optionally after separation of the desired product synthesis or fuel gas, is subsequently hydrogenated, the sulfur compounds still present in the gas stream thereby being converted to hydrogen sulfide, the hydrogen sulfide is removed from the gas stream by adsorption or absorption on a solid or liquid sorbent and the loaded sorbent is supplied to the coal, residues, waste or oil to be gasified.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: Process for treating gases obtained by coal gasification, residue gasification, refuse gasification or oil gasification.** The invention relates to a process for the treatment of gases obtained by coal gasification, residue gasification, waste gasification or oil gasification.Coal gasification plants are built for the production 5 of synthesis gas or fuel gas, which is used for generating electricity in generators which are driven by gas turbines. Coal gasification plants have advantages over directly fired coal-fired power plants, since such plants have more favorable properties with respect to emission and efficiency.10 Currently, many aromatics are being produced as lead replacements in gasolines. In the production of these aromatics, a great deal of H2 is released, which is used in the refineries again in hydrogenation and hydrogenating desulfurization processes. It is expected that the addition of15 aromatics to petrol will be reduced or even stopped completely because aromatics may be carcinogenic. This, however, will lead to a shortage of H2 in refineries. Accordingly, at present residue and/or oil gasification plants are already being installed for the production of hydrogen-containing gas. For20 residues, gasification is most attractive, because burning this type of sulfur-rich streams is prohibited even in marine motors.In the production of synthesis gas or fuel gas, as in coal, residue or oil gasification, many sulfur compounds are25 liberated, which must be removed so as to limit the emission into the atmosphere of SO in particular, which is formed upon combustion of such sulfur compounds.The synthesis or fuel gas originating from the A ' gasification of coal, oil or residues often contains COS, CS2.30 CO2, HCN and NH3 in addition to CO, H and H2S. Such a gas is highly reducing. 

 The extent to which the sulfur compounds must be removed depends on the intended application of the gas and the quality requirements to be met. If synthesis gas must satisfy the so-called "pipeline specification", the hydrogen sulfide content should be reduced to a value less than 5 mg/Nm3. In that case, requirements with respect to the maximum content of other sulfur compounds, such as carbonyl sulfide (COS) and carbon disulfide (CS2) , are to be met as well.In the prior art, many methods are known with which the amount of sulfur compounds in a gas, such as synthesis or fuel gas, can be reduced.Usually, for the removal of sulfur-containing components from gases, the following process route is utilized.

CLAIMS
1. A process for the treatment of synthesis gas or fuel gas obtained by coal gasification, residue gasification, waste gasification or oil gasification, in which the gas stream obtained by gasification, which contains reducing and possibly inert gases, is treated for the removal of sulfur, optionally after separation of the desired product synthesis gas or fuel gas, is subsequently hydrogenated, the sulfur compounds still present in the gas stream thereby being converted to hydrogen sulfide, the hydrogen sulfide is removed from the gas stream by adsorption or absorption on a solid or liquid sorbent and the loaded sorbent is supplied to the coal, residues, waste or oil to be gasified.
2. A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the sorbent consists in part or in whole of the medium to be gasified.
3. A process as claimed in claim 1 of 2, wherein, as sorbent, active carbon, which may or may not have been impregnated with iron oxide, pit coal which may or may not be activated, or brown coal is used. 4. A process as claimed in claims 1-3, wherein the H
2
S obtained after the hydrogenation is oxidized with oxygen at a temperature of less than 120Â°C to form elemental sulfur, which is deposited on the sorbent.
5. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein as sorbent a petroleum fraction, such as residue, is used.
6. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, as sorbent, use is made of iron oxide, copper oxide, calcium oxide and/or manganese oxide.
7. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a liquid sorbent is used, selected from the group consisting of mineral oil, vegetable oil and an alkaline reactive aqueous solution, such as a solution of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and/or calcium hydroxide, or lime milk. 


 8. A process as claimed in claims 1-7, wherein said treatment for the removal of sulfur at least comprises a selective oxidation, which is carried out in such a manner that the greater part of the hydrogen sulfide present is oxidized to elemental sulfur, which is separated.
9. A process as claimed in claims 1-7, wherein the sulfur compounds are separated from the synthesis gas, whereafter these sulfur compounds are converted to elemental sulfur in a conventional manner. 10. A process as claimed in claim 9, wherein the majority of the sulfur compounds are first converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus plant and subsequently the remaining sulfur compounds are subjected to a selective oxidation to elemental sulfur. 11. A process as claimed in claim 8 or 10, characterized in that the selective oxidation of the hydrogen sulfide is carried out using a catalyst as described in European patent application 242,920, 242,006 and/or 409,353.
12. A process as claimed in claims 8-11, characterized in that the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide is carried ' out using a small stoichiometric excess of oxygen relative to the hydrogen sulfide .
13. A process as claimed in claims 1-12, characterized in that when appreciable amounts of HCN and/or NH3 are present in the synthesis gas, these are washed out and/or converted prior to the selective oxidation.
14. A process as claimed in claims 1-13, characterized in that when appreciable amounts of COS and/or CO2 are present in the synthesis gas, these are hydrolyzed prior to and/or subsequent to the hydrogenation.
15. A process as claimed in claims 4-14, characterized in that CO is converted with water to H2 and CO2 prior to the selective oxidation.
16. Synthesis gas or fuel gas obtained utilizing the process according to one or more of claims 1-15.
