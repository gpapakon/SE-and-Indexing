<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (10) for an electronics box (blackbox) (26), which is provided with at least one electronic assembly (40), for accommodating further electronic assemblies (2,4) which can each be electrically conductively connected to the already existing assembly (40). According to the invention, the device (10) has a multi-piece accommodation element (8) which consists of a mounting plate (12) having panels (14,16) which are fitted at the ends such that they can pivot, the mounting plate (12) in each case having locking hooks (28) on the sides (6,42) facing and facing away from the assemblies (2,4), by means of which locking hooks (28), on the one hand, a rear panel (36) which is provided with female strip connectors (38) is detachably connected to the mounting plate (12) and, on the other hand, this device (10) is detachably connected to the electronics box (26). A particularly cost-effective capability is thus obtained of subsequently equipping an electronics box (26) with further assemblies (2,4) which can be electrically conductively connected to an internal equipment bus.
