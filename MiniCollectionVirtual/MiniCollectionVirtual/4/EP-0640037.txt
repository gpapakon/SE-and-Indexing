<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assembly of
corrugated sheets of a particular structure and,
more particularly, to an assembly which may be
adapted primarily for use as heat-transfer media or
contact bodies, fill for gas scrubbers for reducing
air pollution, media for trickling filters used in
water and waste water treatment, media for use in
air scrubbing or stripping equipment, and other
surface media, although other uses are also
contemplated for the assemblies, such as modular
artificial reef systems for marine environments.When the corrugated sheets forming the
assembly are oriented in a generally vertical
direction, the assembly of the present invention
may be used as wet deck fill for evaporative-heat
exchange apparatus. An example of a typical
evaporative heat exchange apparatus is disclosed in
U.S. Patent 3,132,190. Such wet deck fill may, for
example, be used in a cooling tower for air
conditioning or other industrial processes. In
many prior art evaporative-type heat exchangers,
water is distributed over the top of wet deck fill
formed of contact bodies. Generally, such contact
bodies are in the form of corrugated sheet
material. As the water flows over and down the
fill, a thin film of water is formed over the
surface of the fill. A gas stream, typically air,
passes over the water film on the fill to provide 
an evaporative cooling effect. Air flow may be
promoted by the use of a centrifugal blower or fan
from top to bottom (parallel flow), transversely
across the path of the water (crosscurrent) or in a
direction opposite to the flow of the water, namely
bottom to top (countercurrent). The structure of
the present assembly provides increased surface
area over typical prior art contact bodies, which
facilitates heat transfer. In addition, the
present assembly provides increased structural
integrity over many prior art contact bodies.The present invention is also useful as a
modular artificial reef. An example of an
artificial reef is disclosed in U.S. Patent
4,913,094. An assembly formed from corrugated
sheets of the present invention may be oriented as
desired with respect to the floor of a body of
water, such as a marine environment. For example,
the assembly may be oriented in a generally
horizontal or vertical direction. The sheets of
the assembly may be formed from polyvinyl chloride,
which attracts microbes required to establish a
food-chain foundation for higher forms of marine
life. Numerous chambers and openings within the
assembly are advantageous in attracting fish.

<CLAIMS>
An assembly (10) comprising a
plurality of generally parallel corrugated sheets

(12, 14, 16), the corrugations (22) forming
alternating apices (28, 30) in the sheets (12, 14,

16), the apices (28, 30) being connected by angled
walls (32, 34), the corrugations (22) in each sheet

(12, 14, 16) being substantially parallel and
disposed at an oblique angle to an edge (21, 23) of

the sheet (12, 14, 16), adjacent sheets (12, 14,
16) being oriented such that the corrugations (22)

of an adjacent sheet (14) at intersections of the

apices (28, 30), and the sheets having
substantially planar positioner pads (36)

positioned at least at some of the intersections of
the apices (28, 30) of the corrugations (22) of

adjacent sheets (12, 14, 16), the sheets (12, 14,
16) characterized in that the apices (28,30) have

indented portions (42, 44) between each positioner
pad (36).
An assembly (10) according to claim 1,
further characterized in that the positioner pads

(36) are formed at each intersection of the apices
(28, 30) of adjacent sheets (12, 14, 16).
An assembly (10) according to claim 2,
further characterized in that the sheets (12, 14,

16) comprising the assembly are fastened together
by adhesive bonds between abutting positioner pads

An assembly (10) according to claim 2,
further characterized in that the sheets

An assembly according to claim 1,
further characterized in that the sheets have a

pair of spaced, raised bars (38), each bar (38)

pad (36), the bars (38) being substantially
transverse to the corrugations (22), the bars (38)

of each pair being spaced from each other within
the pair such that the distance between the bars

(38) of each pad corresponds to the substantially
transverse dimension (T) of an abutting positioner

pad (36) of an adjacent sheet (12, 14, 16).
An assembly (10) according to claim 5,
further characterized in that the bars (38) of each

pair are parallel and disposed at an angle (C, D)
