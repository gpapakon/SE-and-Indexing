<ABSTRACT>
An all Zircaloy spacer having integral springs and 
single metallic layer spacer thickness between fuel rods is 

disclosed. Each spacer cell includes upper and lower 
octagonal crowns. These octagonal crowns have a full panel 

height adjoining the defined sub-channel volume between fuel 
rods and half panel heights adjoining adjacent cells. The 

crowns at opposite ends of each octagonal spacer cell are 
designed to interleave to form a single wall thickness of the 

spacer material. Accordingly, half wall heights at one crown 
are defined toward the spacer cell while half wall heights at 

the other crown end are defined away from the spacer cell. By 
inverting and adjoining the respective spacer cells at their 

respective crowns, the crowns form upper and lower crown 
matrices holding adjoining cells of the spacer together. From 

two adjacent sides of the four sub-channel adjacent full 
height sides, cell legs extend between the crowns with upper 

and lower stops immediately adjacent the crowns. From the 
remaining two adjacent sides of the four sub-channel adjacent 

full height sides, cell legs extend between the crowns 
defining the required cell springs with spring contact points 

centrally of the legs with respect to the crowns. The leg 
length is set to give the required stiffness for the springs. 

A spacer is disclosed constructed from a matrix of such cells 
preferably including inner and outer bands for adjoining any 

central water rod and surrounding channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nuclear fuel bundle 
spacers for boiling water nuclear reactors. More 
particularly, a fuel bundle spacer is disclosed, having upper 
and lower continuous octagonal grids formed of single metallic 
layer thickness. The spacer also includes integral springs 
and stops built into the body of an all Zircaloy material 
spacer. Modern nuclear fuel bundles for boiling water 
nuclear reactors include a matrix of vertical upstanding and 
sealed nuclear fuel rods. These fuel bundles are held 
together by a lower tie plate for supporting the fuel rods and 
permitting the entry of water, and an upper tie plate for 
permitting the exit of water and generated steam. Some of the 
fuel rods connect to the tie plates and together with the tie 
plates hold the fuel rods of the fuel bundle together as a 
discrete unit. This fuel bundle unit is placed within a so-called 
channel. In-operation, the channel serves to isolate flow in 
the channel interior discretely through the rods of the fuel 
bundle. This interior flow is a characteristic particular to 
boiling water nuclear reactors and is away from a surrounding 
water filled core bypass region. The core bypass region which 
is filled with water provides improved moderation when the 
reactor is operating. Penetration of control rods into the 
core bypass region to displace the water and absorb neutrons 
occurs to control of the reaction. The individual fuel rods are long -- in the order of 
4m (160 inches) -- and slender. Under the dynamics of steam 
generation and absent any kind of restraint, these fuel rods 
would vibrate into abrading contact one with another. For  
 
this reason, there has developed in the art so-called fuel rod 
spacers. The general construction and function of the fuel 
rod spacers is generally easy to understand. Specifically, a 
fuel spacer discretely surrounds each fuel rod at a discrete 
cell in a matrix of fuel rod cells within each spacer. 
Generally, five to nine -- and usually seven -- such spacers 
are utilized at differing elevations along the length of the 
fuel bundle. The result is that the fuel rods at the 
differing elevations along the length of the fuel bundle are 
held in a centered relationship. Spacers cells surrounding each fuel rod have two 
primary structures acting on the fuel rods. These structures 
are a system of stops and springs for centering of the fuel 
rod. The stops define the design centered positions of the 
fuel rods. When the fuel rods are pushed against the stops of 
each spacer
