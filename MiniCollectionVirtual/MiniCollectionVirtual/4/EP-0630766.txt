<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for projecting/reflecting images, in particular for burial monuments in order to make epitaphs (inscriptions) or other information easier to read. According to the invention the apparatus is characterised in that it consists of a box (2) which darkens the external light (7) and is open at a light inlet aperture (10) which is at least partly closed by a diffuser (6) which filters the external light, and has a light outlet aperture (11) equipped with a reflecting device such as a mirror (1), the image (5) to be projected being located at the inlet aperture. Application to burial monuments, street furniture, advertising media or the like.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the projection/reflection of images,
especially for grave markers, city furniture, but not

exclusively, to optimize the reading of a memorial image
(5) or of an information image (5),

characterized in that it is principally constituted by a
housing (2), having the function of dimming external light,

open at two points called respectively a light inlet
opening (10) of the housing and a light outlet opening (11)

of the housing, the light inlet opening (10) of the housing
being closed at least partially by, or comprising in its

vicinity, a diffuser (6) to distribute and possibly filter
the ambient external light (7) intended to pass through a

transparent or translucent image (5) of the kind of
photography or leaded glass window disposed in, or in the

vicinity of the light inlet opening (10) of the housing,
whilst the light outlet opening (11) of the housing is

closed a least partially by, or equipped in its vicinity
with, at least one reflective element such as a mirror (1),

visible to the observer (9) and on which is reflected the
projected image (8).
Device according to claim 1,

characterized in that the housing (2) is ventilated.
Device according to one of claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that the diffuser (6) is incorporated in
the image (5) of the photographic type developed on a

translucent support.
Device according to one of claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that the diffuser (6) is disposed before
the image (5) in the inlet direction of the light (7) into

the interior of the housing (2).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the image (5) is protected from

inclemencies by a support such as a frame, a pocket, an
envelope or the like, which limits a volume which is at

least partially closed and of which at least two surfaces
are translucent or transparent.
Device according to claim 5,

characterized in that the frame, the pocket, the envelope
or the like adapted to protect the image is constituted by

a double glazing.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that the housing is positioned by means of
at least one suitable support such as an arch (3).
Device for projection/reflection according to one of
claims 1 to 7,

characterize in that it is disposed on the surface of a
tombstone, the light inlet opening (10) of the housing (2)

being positioned towards the sky and the light outlet

opening (11) of the housing (2) being directed towards the
ground at a variable inclination from 0 to 180Â°.
