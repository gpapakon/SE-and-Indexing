<ABSTRACT>
A blood component collection system with optimization 
capabilities. In one embodiment, process parameters are 

derived from an input/configured predetermined blood 
component yield and which is based upon the maximization of 

at least one process parameter. Thereafter, the blood 
component collection procedure is performed with these 

derived process control parameters. In another embodiment, 
process parameters are derived from an input total 

procedure time from a maximized value for at least one of 
the other process control parameters so as to maximize 

blood component yield in this fixed time. Thereafter, the 
blood component collection procedure is performed with 

these derived parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field 
of blood component collection systems and, more 
particularly, to providing management capabilities by 
incorporating optimization principles into such systems. The utilization of blood taken from donors and infused 
into recipients is well known for purposes of treating 
medical emergencies and other conditions. More recently, 
selected blood components have been separated and collected 
from blood for subsequent infusion into recipients 
requiring blood component therapy. The primary blood 
components include platelets, red blood cells, white blood 
cells, and plasma.  In order to collect blood components, blood is removed 
from a donor by a needle assembly or other blood access 
device and is thereafter processed utilizing centrifugation 
or other appropriate separation techniques to isolate and 
collect the desired components. This procedure is carried 
out most effectively in an on-line process wherein blood is 
removed from a donor, processed through a disposable 
extracorporeal circuit to obtain the desired components, 
and thereafter returned to the donor. One blood component 
collection system which provides for this type of blood 
component collection procedure is the COBE Spectra™ which 
is commercially available from the assignee of the present 
application. The yield of a particular collection of blood 
components is an important factor. For instance, presently 
in the United States a yield must be associated with a 
collection of blood components in order to be a useful 
blood component product. COBE Spectra™ presently 
accommodates for this requirement by processing certain 
donor biological data such as height, weight, sex, and 
hematocrit, preconfigured/operator-input data such as the 
total procedure time, and system-related data such as the 
type of collection procedure (e.g., single or double 
needle) and collection efficiency to generate certain 
process parameters such as the inlet flow to COBE Spectra™ 
(a combined flow of whole blood from the donor plus 
typically a flow of anticoagulant) and a predicted blood 
component yield as well.  An additional consideration presently in the United 
States relating to blood component yield is that it is 
determinative of the product classification. With regard 
to platelets, presently a single platelet product is 
considered to be a collection of 3 x 10¹¹ platelets and a 
double platelet product is considered to be a collection of 
6 x 10¹¹ platelets. If the collection is between 3 x
