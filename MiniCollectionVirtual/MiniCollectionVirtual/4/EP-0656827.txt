<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods,
apparatus and compositions for making plastic lenses.It is conventional in the art to produce optical
lenses by thermal curing techniques from the polymer of
diethylene glycol bis(allyl)-carbonate (DEG-BAC).The polymer of DEG-BAC exhibits desirable optical
and mechanical properties. These properties include high
light transmission, high clarity, and high index of
refraction together with high abrasion and impact
resistance. These properties in the past made DEG-BAC
one of the leading monomers in the manufacture of high
quality lenses, face shields, sun and safety glasses.
Other properties of DEG-BAC, however, such as its slow 
rate of polymerization, make it an undesirable monomer in the manufacture of these items.
Moreover, DEG-BAC, without any additives or co-monomers, produces a hard but somewhat
brittle polymer that is very prone to cracking. In addition, DEG-BAC, without additives, tends to
adhere tightly to the lens forming molds, often leading to cracking of the molds.In addition, the thermal curing techniques for polymerizing DEG-BAC to produce optical
lenses have several disadvantages and drawbacks. One of the most significant drawbacks is that it
may take approximately 12 hours to produce a lens according to thermal curing techniques. A
lens forming mold, therefore, can produce at most two lenses per day.Moreover, thermal curing techniques employ a thermal catalyst so that a polymerizable
mixture of DEG-BAC and catalyst will slowly polymerize even while refrigerated. The
polymerizable mixture therefore has a very short shelf life and must be used within a short time or
it will harden in its container.Furthermore, the thermal catalysts utilized according to the thermal curing techniques are
quite volatile and dangerous to work with, thus requiring extreme care in handling.Curing of a lens by ultraviolet light presents certain problems that must be overcome to
produce a viable lens. Such problems include yellowing of the lens, cracking of the lens or mold,
optical distortions in the lens, and premature release of the lens from the mold.European Patent Application 0 322 353 A2 discloses a method and apparatus for curing a
photocurable plastic material by irradiating a central part of a mold cavity, one surface of which is
made of light transmitting material, and then enlarging a ring of light until the lighted area reaches
the periphery of the cavity, thereby curing the entire material.The present invention is directed to methods, apparatus and
