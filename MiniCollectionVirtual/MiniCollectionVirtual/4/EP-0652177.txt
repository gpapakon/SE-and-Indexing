<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for forming and transporting piles (stacks) of sheets in a stacking device (20) which is continuously fed, comprising a sheet conveyor (10) for supplying a succession of sheets to a stacking device (20). A principal support member (21) supports the piles (5) in the stacking device (20), this support (21) being vertically movable downwards in order to receive and unload (discharge) the piles (5) and vertically movable upwards in order to pick up the next piles. A separation member (23) can be inserted laterally between the edge of the pile (5) and is capable of separating a string (train) (25) containing a predetermined number of sheets of successive piles of sheets. The separation member (23) includes an elastic element (23a) enabling it to be inserted in front in the pile (5) of sheets in the stacking device (20) by means of a spring effect. The separation member (23) limits any descending displacement of an edge of the following piles above this one during lowering of the principal support member (21), thus creating a slot for the insertion of an auxiliary support member (22) and the support for the next piles. A transport conveyor (40) is provided for withdrawing the string (25) of sheets from the principal support member (21).

A method for the formation and the transport of
sheet stacks in a stacker (20) continuously supplied with

sheets, the method comprising the steps of:

continuously delivering the sheets to a sheet
conveyor (10),
passing the sheets gradually from the conveyor (10)
to the stacker (20),
collecting the sheets in one or more stacks (5) in
the stacker (20) upon a main carrying means (21),
lowering the carrying means (21) gradually as the
sheets collect on the carrying means (21) so as to

generally maintain a sheet drop off height between the
conveyor (10) and the uppermost sheet collected on the

carrying means (11),
actuating a separation means (23) in the stacker
(20) for separating a batch (25) of sheets containing a

predetermined number of sheets of the successive sheet
stacks passing into the stacker (20),
inserting an auxiliary support means (22) into the

stacker (20) beneath the bottom sheet of the successive
sheet stacks to support them in the stacker away from the

batch (25) on the main carrying means (21),

so that, when the separation means (23) is inserted in
the stack (5), the main carrying means (21) is lowered,

thereby creating a cleft between the separation means (23)
which limits the displacement of the edge of the successive

stacks and the top sheet of the batch (25) on the main
carrying means (21), to permit the insertion of the

auxiliary support means (22) and the support of the
successive sheet stacks,
forwarding the batch (25) on the main carrying
means (21) to a transport conveyor (40),

   characterized in that the separation means (23) is
forced forwardly into the sheet stack (5) in the stacker

(20) under the load of a spring (23a) during its actuation.
The method according to claim 1, characterized in
further comprising:


bringing the main carrying means (21) back into the
stacker (20) to transfer thereto support of the successive

stack from the auxiliary support means,
retracting the auxiliary support means (22) from the
stacker (20), and
moving the separation means (23) to a position
disengaged from the stack (5) in the stacker (20).
The method according to claim 2, characterized in
that the main carrying means (21) is returned empty to the

stacker (20) and in that

support of the successive stack is transferred to the
main carrying means (21) prior to accumulation of a

complete stack on the auxiliary support means (22).
The method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the batch (25) is transported by the transport

conveyor (40) in a first direction and is transferred on a
discharge means (60) comprising conveyor transporting belts

(61) to forward the batch (25) in a second direction
generally perpendicular to the first direction.
An apparatus for forming and transporting sheet
stacks in a stacker (20) continuously supplied with sheets,

the apparatus comprising:

a sheet conveyor (10) for continuously delivering
successive sheets into a stacker (20),
the stacker (20) having means for collecting the

sheets into one or more vertical stacks (5),
a main carrying means (21) for supporting the stacks
in the stacker (20), the carrying means (21) being

vertically movable downward to receive and discharge the
stacks (5) and upward to retrieve the successive stacks

(5),
a separation means (23) insertable laterally between
the edge of the stack (5) and adapted to separate a batch 

(25) containing a predetermined number of sheets of the
successive sheet stacks,
an auxiliary support means (22) insertable laterally
beneath the bottom sheet of the successive sheet stacks

while the main carrying means (21) transports the batch
(25) of predertermined sheets downward,
so that the separation means (23) limits any downward
displacement of an edge of the successive stacks above said

separation means (23) during the lowering of the main
carrying means (21), thereby creating a cleft for the

insertion of the auxiliary support means (22) and the
support of the successive sheet stacks,
a transport conveyor (40) for taking the batch (25) of
sheets from the main carrying means (21),

   characterized in that the separation means (23)
comprises an elastic element (23a) permitting its insertion

forwardly into the stack (5) of sheets in the stacker (20)
by spring power.
The apparatus according to claim 5, characterized
in that the separation means (23) comprises a spring leaf

(23a) having a shoulder (23c) to permit its insertion and
its engagement in the stack (5) in the stacker (20).
The apparatus according to claim 6, characterized
in that the spring leaf (23a) is attached to a spindle

(23b) adapted to rotate around an axis so as to pivot the
spring leaf (23a) and force insertion of the shoulder (23c)

into the stack by spring power.
The apparatus according to claim 5, characterized
in further comprising a discharge means (60) having a

series of conveyor transporting belts (61) spaced from each
other to forward the stacks from the transport conveyor

(40) in a generally perpendicular direction.
The apparatus according to claim 8, characterized
in that means are provided for moving the transporting

belts (61) in a vertical direction so as to be disposed 
between the rollers (41) of the transport conveyor (40) and

to receive the stack (5).
The apparatus according to claim 8, characterized
in that the sheets continuously supplied from the sheet

conveyor (10) comprise several regular adjacent flows of
sheets so as to form several stacks (5) in parallel, the

transporting belts (51) permitting the forwarding of stacks
(5) which are formed in parallel successively to a hoop

device.
