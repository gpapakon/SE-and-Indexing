<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal print head (10), a partial glazed layer (13) has a 
width of 0. 1 to 0. 4 mm and a height of 15 to 25 µm. With 

the partial glazed layer (13) of this size, since the amount of 
accumulated heat is reduced, no trailing phenomenon would 

arise so as to improve the printing quality. It is also 
advantageous that no defective product will be manufactured 

because the glazed layer (13) is not too small, with less energy 
consumption. As a result, a high-quality printing operation 

can be maintained even during such high-speed printing as not 
exceeding 1 ms per one line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printer having a print unit
with a thermal print head,
and more particularly a thermal head having an improved
glazed layer for enhancing printing efficiency.A thermal print head generates heat in response to
supplied driving current to perform printing on a heat sensitive
sheet. In this case, it is general to provide a glazed
layer beneath a heat generating resistor as a heat accumulating
layer, due to a large heat dissipation capacity of a
ceramic substrate.The glazed layer acts to prevent the heat from dissipating
so as to improve the energy efficiency. Without this
glazed layer, an excessively large amount of energy would be
required to sufficiently heat the head in order to start
printing, resulting in significantly poor energy efficiency.
If the glazed layer is too large, however, the heat dissipation
capacity would become deteriorated so as to prevent the
once heated printing section (heat generating section) from
quickly cooling. As a result, this residual heat causes a
tailing phenomenon.In this manner, while the glazed layer in a thermal head 
acts as a heat accumulating layer to improve the energy efficiency,
it may also lead to lowering of the printing quality.
The shape and size of the glazed layer play important roles
and should be determined in view of the relationship to the
energy efficiency and the printing quality.It has been impossible, however, to perform the printing
operation at a speed higher than approximately 3 msec which is
the cooling time of the conventional print head. For increasing
the printing speed, so-called heat history control
has been used, in which the heat generating amount is varied
by adjusting the printing energy in view of printing data
stored in a memory. Even with this control, however, the
critical recording speed is approximately 0. 8 msec, at which
speed it is not easy to carry out printing with high quality.Thus, in the conventional printing device provided with
such a type of thermal print head, the printing quality was
not sufficient in the case of high speed printing. High speed
printing of bar codes, for example, would easily result in
insufficient printing of bars, leading to reading errors. A known thermal print head (EP-A-0 523 884) comprises an insulating
substrate, a partial glazed layer, a heat generating resistor, common and
discrete electrodes fromed on the heat generating resistor to define a heat
generating section of the heat generating resistor on the partial glazed
layer, and a protective layer covering
