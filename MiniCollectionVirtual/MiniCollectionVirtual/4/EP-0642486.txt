<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a hydro(halo)fluorocarbon which comprises heating an  alpha -fluoroether in the vapour phase at elevated temperature.  alpha -fluoroethers are obtained by reacting a non-enolisable aldehyde with hydrogen fluoride to form an intermediate and reacting the intermediate with an alcohol or a halogenating agent. Novel  alpha -fluoroethers are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of hydrofluorocarbons from α-fluoroethers
and a process for the production of α-fluoroethers
and novel α-fluoroethers suitable for use in the
production of hydrofluorocarbons, particularly to a
process for the production of hydrofluoroalkanes.In recent years chlorofluorocarbons, which are
used on a large scale around the world, have been
perceived as having an adverse effect on the ozone
layer and/or as contributing to global warming.
Chlorofluorocarbons are used, for example, as
refrigerants, as foam blowing agents, as cleaning
solvents and as propellants for aerosol sprays in
which the vari-ety of applications is virtually
unlimited. Consequently, much effort is being devoted
to finding suitable replacements for
chlorofluorocarbons which will perform satisfactorily
in the many applications in which chlorofluorocarbons
are used but which will not have the aforementioned
environmentally harmful effects. One approach in the
search for suitable replacements has centred on
fluorocarbons which do not contain chlorine but which
may contain hydrogen, that is hydrofluorocarbons, of
which many have been proposed as suitable
replacements.Several methods for the preparation of
hydrofluorocarbons are known but many of these
methods involve the use of chlorine-containing
starting materials and the production of
chlorine-containing by-products. The present invention provides a chlorine-free
process for the production of hydrofluorocarbons and
a process for the production of
hydrohalofluorocarbons.According to the present invention there is
provided a process for the production of a
hydro(halo)fluorocarbon which comprises heating an
α-fluoroether in the vapour phase at an elevated
temperature.By an α-fluoroether there is meant an ether
having a fluorine atom attached to a carbon atom in
the α-position relative to the oxygen atom, that is
an ether containing the group -C-O-CF- and thus an
ether having the general formula R-O-CFR1R2, wherein
R, R1 and R2 are as hereinafter defined.We have found that α-fluoroethers of formula
R-O-CF-R1R2 may be caused to breakdown upon heating
to yield a hydro(halo)fluorocarbon R-F and a compound
containing a carbonyl group, usually an aldehyde
R1R2CO. The ether apparently breaks down by
transference of an α-fluorine atom from one α-carbon
atom to the other α-carbon atom to yield a
hydro(halo)fluorocarbon R-F (referred to hereafter as
the fluorine-exchange product). The ether may in some
cases also break down by transference of an
α-
