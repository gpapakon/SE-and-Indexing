 SODIUM IODIDE 131I CAPSULESBackgroundThe present invention relates to radiopharmaceutical products used in the treatment of thyroid diseases. In particular, the present invention relates to sodium iodide131I capsules which have increased stability and lower volatility.The use of 131I-iodide for the treatment of thyroid disease is known in the prior art. In particular, the administration of millicurie amounts of the 131I-iodide beta emitting isotope to destroy thyroid tissue is generally accepted as preferable to surgical treatment. This is particularly true when malignant or metastatic processes might be involved. The radioiodide has been effectively supplied in both liquid and capsule form, suitable for oral administration, with the choice between the two apparently based on the preference of the treatment provider.Because of the highly toxic and volatile nature of iodine, the radioiodide formulations have always presented a relatively high degree of risk to those handling the formulations. To reduce this risk, packages of the 131I- iodide are generally opened in fume hoods to avoid accidental inhalation of iodine. Further, special storage containers having adsorbent iodine traps are used to ship and store the prepared radioiodide.The iodide ion itself has no volatility, and therefore, the air-borne spread of radioactivity is believed to be caused by another chemical species. Several species are suspected as the carrier of radioactivity, such a hydriodic acid (HI), hypoiodus acid (HOI), iodine (I2) , and organic derivatives such as methyl iodide. The fact that the volatile component reacts with styrofoam, used in 

the shipping containers, and forms a relatively permanent bond therewith, indicates that the carrier is iodine (I2) -Difficulties in determining the radioactive volatility of iodide solutions, is caused by the presence of a second source of radioactivity within the capsules. Xenon-131m is formed by decay of radioiodide, and may be present in amounts generally of less than 1%. This makes volatility measurements somewhat misleading when the total volatility is below 0.08%. In particular, at total levels below 0.08%, the amount of radioiodide must be quantified by a detector capable of reading the 364 Kev energy of 131I. This is because the Xenon-131m has an energy of 164 Kev, which interferes with the standard ion chamber readings. When total volatility is above 0.08%, the volatility may be attributed entirely to iodine.The volatility of 131I capsules may be controlled and reduced by
