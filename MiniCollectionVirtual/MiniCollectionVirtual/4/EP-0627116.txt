<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a read-write optical memory comprising a plurality of juxtaposed memory cells (11), each receiving a respective light beam (3). Each memory cell contains a storage medium (10), which includes a storage element (23) having stable optical states. The storage element (23) is divided into a number of memory points, and the optical state in a given memory point can be both changed and read by means of a light beam (3) directed towards the memory point. The memory can be implemented entirely without any movable mechanical parts and has a very short read-write time and an exceptionally high storage capacity. Parallel writing and reading of multibit words is possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical memory.
More specifically, the invention relates to an optical
memory which has a high storage capacity, short access
time for writing and reading of information, and which
can be implemented entirely without any movable mechanical
parts.Today's systems for mass storage of binary information
can be roughly divided into three main categories:
1. Magnetic medium (hard disc)2. Optical medium (CD-ROM)3. Magneto-optical medium1. A hard disc, i.e. a magnetic disc storage which
is mechanically rotated when writing and reading information,
requires mechanical positioning of a read-write
head, entailing a relatively long average seek time for
positioning in the order of 10-15 ms, a limited read-write
speed, as well as a relatively limited storage capacity.
In principle, the storage capacity of a hard disc can only
be increased by using a larger area, which entails the
disadvantage of necessitating a larger movement for positioning,
i.e. a longer seek time.2. A CD-ROM has a comparatively high storage capacity,
but is a slow medium which does not permit writing
but only reading since, traditionally, the information is
stored when making the memory.3. A magneto-optical medium, which is of a design
closely related to that of a CD-ROM, acts such that the
information is stored on a rotary disc containing magnetic
particles which, when writing the information, are heated
by a laser beam above their Curie temperature. Drawbacks
of this type of storage medium are the relatively limited 
capacity and the slow writing speed. Writing may, for
example, be up to six times slower than for a hard disc.Optical memories employing a light beam are known from US-A- 4250 567
and use of acousto-optic deflection from US-A- 3703 137. Furthermore, a laser matrix is known
from FR-A- 2659 780With the ever increasing need of information storage,
there is a great demand for a storage medium that does not
suffer from the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art.
A general object of the invention is to provide a storage
medium meeting this demand.A first object of the invention is to provide a storage
medium having a high storage capacity.A second object of the invention is to provide a
storage medium having short access time for writing and
reading of information.A third object of the invention is to provide a storage
medium that can be implemented without any mechanically
movable parts.A fourth object of the invention is to provide a
storage medium having a compact structure and relatively
small

of which is adapted to receive a respective light beam
