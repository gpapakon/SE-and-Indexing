<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an optical system that images a 
matrix of LED sources (12) of different colors on a photosensitive medium 

(40). More specifically, the optical system comprises mirrors (22,24) for 
focusing light on a photosensitive recording medium (40). The optical 

system also includes a baffle (B) for blocking light omitted from the LED 
sources (12) from propagating directly towards the image surface (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
Cross-references are made to commonly assigned, copending
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 123,839, filed September 20, 1993, in
the names of Douglas H. Smith et al and entitled "Method and Apparatus
for Exposing Photosensitive Media With Multiple Light Sources".This invention relates to improved optical or imaging systems
for use in electro-optical color printers and method for using such an
optical system.A typical electro-optic printer comprises a printhead having a
plurality of point-like electro-optic recording elements, such as light
emitting diodes (LEDs) for providing a source of light and a refractive
optical system for focusing or imaging the light emitted by such LEDs on
a photosensitive material. In known color printers for recording on color
photographic film or paper, several LEDs are used that emit light with
different spectral content. The LED light is typically red, blue and green.When a single refractive imaging system (also called a lens
system) is used to focus light beams of different wavelengths, such a lens
system is likely to suffer from color aberrations. Correction of color
aberrations in a lens system requires additional lens elements and also
often requires the use of expensive glass materials. In addition, a typical
printer application requires that the lens system have a low F number to
ensure sufficient light for exposure. A low F number is also difficult to
achieve without having a large number of lens elements. Thus, a lens
system having a low F number and, which is also color corrected, is
complex, has many optical elements and is usually expensive to
manufacture.An alternative solution is to use multiple lens systems, where
each lens system focuses different color beams. Not only are multiple 
lens systems expensive, but they also have to be aligned with respect to
each other and each of them has to be aligned to the photosensitive
medium.Other types of electro-optic printers are also known. One such
printer is disclosed in European patent application having the publication
no. 0321143. This publication discloses a near contact printer which
utilizes a LCM or similar modulator and/or luminaries and does not
require an optical imaging system for imaging the luminaries onto a
photosensitive medium.Reflective systems are known. For example, US patent no.
5,212,588 discloses a two mirror imaging system. However, such mirror
systems are not and cannot be beneficially utilized in the prior art printer
apparati known to the applicant.It is therefore an object of the present

<CLAIMS>
An electro-optic printer apparatus, for printing onto an
associated imaging surface, said apparatus comprising:


(a) a matrix array of plural point-like, light-emitting sources,
said sources (12) emitting light in a plurality of colors;
(b) a single, non refractive imaging system located between
said matrix array of plural, point-like, light-emitting sources (12) and the

associated imaging surface, said single non-refractive system including a

first mirror (22) and a second mirror (24), each of said mirrors having a
curved reflective surface (25,27) with a space (32) defined between the

surfaces, the curved reflective surfaces (25,27) facing one another, said
first mirror (22) having an outlet opening (26) to permit light emitted by

said point-like emitting sources (12) to propagate from said space (32),
said light emitting sources (12) being located adjacent to said second

mirror (24) and emitting said light towards said first mirror, said surfaces
(25,27) being curved and spaced so that light from said light sources

reflects from said first mirror (22) towards said second mirror (24), then
reflects from said second mirror (24) and then propagates through said

opening (28) and is imaged upon the associated imaging surface (40);
(c) means supporting said associated imaging surface, said
associated imaging surface (40) being adjacent to said first mirror (22);

and
(d) a baffle (B) located in said space (32) and relative to said
sources (12) so as to block light emitted from said sources (12) from

propagating directly towards said associated imaging surface (40) without
reflecting in said imaging system.
The printer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein each
of the reflective surfaces (25,27) of said mirrors (22,24) is a conic section.
The printer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein each
of the reflective surfaces (25,27) of said mirrors (22,24) is hyperbolic. 
The printer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
first and said second mirrors (22,24) have the appropriate radii of

curvature and distance between said reflective surfaces so that the F-number
of the imaging system is less than 2.0.
The printer apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
F-number of the imaging system is about 1.0.
The printer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein a
focal point of said imaging system is located a distance, d
1
, from a rear
surface of said first mirror wherein 1 mm 
<
 d
1
 
<
 5mm.
The printer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
light-emitting sources (12) are LEDs that emit, respectively, light in

respective different colors.
A method for printing images comprising:

generating light from a light source array (12) that outputs light
at a plurality of point-like light source locations emitting light in a plurality

of colors; and
reflecting the light between reflecting surfaces (25,27) of two
mirrors (22,24) so that reflections of image-forming light beams each

follow a series of zigzag turns within a space between the mirrors (22,24)
and converge through an aperture (26) in one of the mirrors to exit the

space (32) between the mirrors and form an image on a light sensitive
surface (40) without passing through refracting optics.
