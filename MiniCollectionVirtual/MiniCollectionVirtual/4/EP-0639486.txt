<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile station (1) belonging to a radio communication system and transmitting in alarm mode, at least one message requesting that a connection be made, in response to first events. The message is transmitted through the transmission and reception means (21) in the station (1). These transmission and reception means (21) are capable of transmitting and receiving if, and only if, on the one hand they are powered and, on the other hand, a subscriber identification module (3) is validated in response to a positive comparison between data stored in the module (3) and a code which is keyed in. In order to increase the autonomy of the mobile station (1), means (20, 30, 4) are provided for selectively powering each of the said transmission and reception means (21) and module (3), so that, in this alarm mode, the module (3) is continuously powered in order to be kept validated and the said transmission and reception means (21) are powered in response to the said first events in order to transmit the said message, of which there is at least one.

<CLAIMS>
A mobile station (1) belonging to a radiocommunications system and 
responding, in a first operating mode, to first events by 

transmitting at least one connection set-up request message, said at 
least one message being transmitted via transmit and receive means 

(21) in the station (1), said transmit and receive means (21) being 
suitable for transmitting and receiving if and only if firstly they 

are powered, and secondly a subscriber identity module (3) is enabled 
in response to a positive result to comparison made between data 

stored in said module and an entered code;
 
   said mobile station being characterized in that it includes 

selective powering means (20, 30, 4) for selectively powering said 
module (3) and said transmit and receive means (21), so that, in said 

first operating mode, said module (3) is powered permanently so as to 
be maintained enabled, and said transmit and receive means (21) are 

powered in response to said first events so as to transmit said at 
least one message. 
A mobile station (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the means (20, 30, 4) for selectively powering said module (3) and 

said transmit and receive means (21) comprise first and second power 
supply devices (20, 30), and switching means (4), which switching 

means (4) are controlled to activate or to deactivate respective ones 
of said first and second power supply devices (20, 30) so that said 

module (3) and said transmit and receive means (21) are respectively 
switched either on or off. 
A mobile station (1) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that it further includes a microprocessor (22) associated with and 

powered in common with said transmit and receive means (21), and 

sensor means sensitive to said first events, said microprocessor (22) 
being powered in response to said first events, and in response to 

second events, and implementing processing as soon as it is switched 
on, which processing is defined by the following two alternatives: 


if the microprocessor (22) receives from said sensor means a 
detection signal indicating that one of said first events has been  

 
detected, said microprocessor (22) causes said set-up request message 

to be transmitted via said transmit and receive means (21); 
if the microprocessor (22) does not receive from said sensor 
means a detection signal indicating that one of said first events has 

been detected, said microprocessor (22) causes said selective 
powering means (20, 30, 4) to switch off the module (3), so that said 

module is no longer enabled, and so that it must be switched on and 
enabled again for the transmit and receive means to be capable of 

transmitting and receiving. 
A mobile station (1) according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by a second operating mode of said station (1), in 

which mode both said module (3) and said transmit and receive means 
(21) are switched on, it being possible for data to be transmitted 

and received via said transmit and receive means (21) provided that 
said module (3) is enabled.
