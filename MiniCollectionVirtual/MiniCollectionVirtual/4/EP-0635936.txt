<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmission system for time-division multiplex transmission of signals, having at least one transmitter with a power amplifier (1). This power amplifier has a control input, to which a control voltage (Uc) is fed. It amplifies a radio-frequency input signal (RFin) to produce a radio-frequency output signal (RFout). A detector (2), supplying a detector voltage (U0 + Uist), is provided to detect the power of the output signal (RFout). The detector voltage (U0 + Uist) represents the sum of a detector quiescent voltage (U0) and an actual voltage (Uist). The invention further relates to a transmitter and to a control loop having the abovementioned features. It is proposed to provide means (4) for generating a desired voltage (Usoll) and means (5) for generating the control voltage (Uc) from the difference between the detector voltage (U0 + Uist) and the desired voltage (Usoll), upon which desired voltage a detector quiescent voltage (U0) is superimposed. The desired voltage (Usoll) determines the time characteristic of the power of the output signal (RFout).
