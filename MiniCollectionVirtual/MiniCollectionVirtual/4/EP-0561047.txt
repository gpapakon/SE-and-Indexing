<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical cell for carrying out electrochemical processes - for example regeneration of chromic acid or electrochemical treatment of methanesulphonic acid - has a plurality of plate-shaped bipolar electrodes (4) which are kept apart by frames (2) - in each case forming an electrolyte compartment between two adjacent electrodes, the electrolyte compartments being sealed in a liquid-tight manner in the lateral and bottom region, and adjacent bipolar electrodes being electrically insulated from one another. The electrodes are tensioned with respect to the frames by means of tubular sealing elements (6) which can be expanded by pressurisation and which are each inserted, so that their position is fixed, in a U-shaped groove (8) of the frames. The cell is not sealed at the liquid surface of the electrolyte, but can be provided with a cover, depending on the application. In order to remove electrodes, the tension is released by reducing the pressure inside the sealing elements.
