<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the use of low molecular weight polymers in a high solids hair spray 
composition containing levels of volatile organic compounds 80% or lower by weight. The hair fixative 

polymers suitable for use in these hair sprays are based on acrylic and vinyl-ester resins that are water 
soluble with neutralization. The polymers have intrinsic viscosities ranging from 0.100 to 0.300 and are 

present in amounts ranging from 7 weight percent to 20 weight percent, based on the total weight of the hair 
spray composition. The use of a lower molecular weight polymer reduces the viscosity, enhances the spray 

characteristics, and promotes the hydrolytic stability of the system. The high solids content compensates 
for any lower fixative properties generally associated with lower molecular weight hair care polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of low molecular weight, hydrolytically stable polymers in a high 
solids hair spray formulation containing levels of volatile organic compounds 80% or lower by weight. Most hair spray formulations contain a film-forming polymer in an alcohol or a mixture of alcohol 
and water delivery system. In the case of aerosol delivery, the delivery system will also contain a 
propellant, which is typically a volatile hydrocarbon. Such aerosol systems are discussed in, for instance, 
United States Patent 3,810,977, Levine et al., wherein hair fixing terpoloymer compositions of vinyl 
acetate, crotonic acid and at least one vinyl ester of an alpha-branched saturated aliphatic 
monocarboxylic acid having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms in the carboxyl acid moiety are disclosed. The 
polymers may contain from 7% to 89% of vinyl ester of an alpha-branched saturated aliphatic 
monocarboxylic acid having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms in the carboxyl acid moiety are disclosed. The 
polymers may contain from 7% to 89% of vinyl acetate and from about 5% to 80% of the selected vinyl 
ester. United States Patent 4,567,035, Waxman et al., discloses a low molecular weight hair spray resin 
containing a vinyl monomer having an electron withdrawing group as described therein and consisting 
essentially of alternating units of vinyl ester and an alkyl half ester maleate derived from alternating vinyl 
ester/maleic anhydride copolymer. It is stated that using resins having alternating monomer structure 
and containing an approximate 50/50 mole ratio of vinyl ester/maleic anhydride half ester units is 
important in providing the soap solution solubility of the hair spray resin. Accordingly, it is essential that 
the "Waxman" resins be derived from a preformed vinyl ester/maleic anhydride alternating copolymer 
under specific reaction conditions for subsequent esterification of the anhydride group.  United States Patent 3,927,199, Micchelli et al., discloses hair fixative compositions containing 
as the film forming resinous binder an interpolymer derived from (1) N-alkyl acrylamides or 
methacrylamides, (2) acidic film forming comonomers, and (3) at least one polymerizable comonomer. 
The interpolymer is said to comprise 30-60% of the N-substituted acrylamide or methacrylamide. In order to be effective in a hair fixative composition, such as aerosol sprays in which alcohols 
and hydrocarbon delivery systems are used, the film forming polymeric binders utilized therein, as well 
as the films formed therefrom,
