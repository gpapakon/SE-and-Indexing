An acoustic characteristic correction device (10) 
includes a section (38, 140) for setting a desired 

characteristic of a response characteristic in a 
reproduction system including a sound field, a section 

(124, 126, 128, 130, 132) for outputting information of 
a measured characteristic of the response 

characteristic, a section (142) for computing a 
correction characteristic for realizing the desired 

characteristic on the basis of the desired 
characteristic and the measured characteristic, and a 

section (34) for imparting the computed correction 
characteristic to a sound signal to be reproduced. The 

device may further includes a display section for 
displaying the set desired characteristic, a section for 

controlling the level or frequency of the computed 
correction characteristic, a section for imparting a 

compensation characteristic to the correction 
characteristic. Results of measurement at plural points 

for plural measuring times may be stored and an average 
value of the results of measurement may be used as a 

measuring signal. In measuring a response characteristic 
by using a TSP signal, a 
convolution operator may be 
used commonly for time compression by an inverse filter 

characteristic and imparting of a correction 
characteristic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an acoustic
characteristic correction device for correcting a
response characteristic such as frequency response of a
reproduction system including a sound field such as a
listening room to a desired characteristic.As a device for correcting a response
characteristic of an entire reproduction system
including a room and loudspeaker, there is generally
known a graphic equalizer which divides an audio
frequency range into several regions and adjusts gain
of each divided region. It is, however, not possible in
the graphic equalizer to know how a reproduced sound can
be adjusted to a desired characteristic.For solving this problem of the conventional
graphic equalizer and enabling a response characteristic
of the entire reproduction system to be automatically
set to a desired characteristic, there is a device
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication
No. Sho 61-59004. According to this device, a user or a
listener sets a desired characteristic, reproduces a
measuring signal such as a white noise or impulse by a
loudspeaker of a reproduction system in a sound field in
which a tone signal is to be reproduced, collects the 
measuring signal by a microphone to measure a response
characteristic, obtains a correction characteristic so
that the measured characteristic will conform to the
desired characteristic, sets a filter characteristic of
the equalizer so as to agree with the correction
characteristic, and reproduces a tone signal through
this equalizer whereby music can be enjoyed in a state
adjusted to the desired characteristic. The amount of
correction obtained by the automatic adjustment is
displayed graphically as in the conventional graphic
equalizer.Since the graphic equalizer is used to equalize
(i.e., to obtain a flat characteristic) a response
characteristic of a reproduction system including a
sound field, it is conceivable, for setting a desired
characteristic in the case of automatically adjusting
the amount of correction, to preset, in a ROM or the
like device, several characteristics such as a flat
characteristic and, if necessary, a characteristic
obtained by attenuating a high frequency region or a low
frequency region from a flat characteristic and to
select a desired one of these preset characteristics on
the basis of an operation by a user and set this
selected characteristic as a desired characteristic. In
this case, the device disclosed in the above mentioned
Japanese Publication No. Sho 61-59004 which merely 
displays the automatically adjusted
