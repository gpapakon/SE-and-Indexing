<DESCRIPTION>
Glycoprotein processing is a complex, poorly understood
means by which the sugar groups of a previously
glycosylated protein are "trimmed" or "processed" in a
particular sequence to obtain a specific pattern of
glycosylation. The specificity is important to a number of
recognition processes and is the basis for cell-cell and
cell-virus interactions. The trimming is accomplished by a
set of highly specific enzymes which recognize particular
sequences of sugars. One such enzyme, Glucosidase I, is
responsible for cleaving the three terminal glucose residues
in the oligosaccharide structure (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2).
Clearly, inhibitors of such an enzyme could be useful in
treating diseases and conditions in which glycoproteins are
involved.Certain viruses including the retroviruses have, in
addition to the usual viral capsid, an outer membrane of
lipid and glycoprotein, similar to the membrane of ordinary
cells. Indeed, the lipid of the viral membrane is probably 
derived directly from the membrane of a previously
infected host cell; however, the glycoprotein of the viral
membrane is unique to the virus itself and is coded for by
the viral genome. Infection of a host cell by a
glycoprotein coated virus initially relies on the
interaction of various receptors on the host cell surface
with the glycoprotein membrane envelope of the virus.
Subsequently, the virus and cell membranes fuse and the
virion contents are released into the host cell cytoplasm.
Thus the glycoprotein envelope of the coated viruses plays
an important role in both the initial interaction of the
virion and the host cell and in the later fusion of the
viral and host cell membranes.Interference with the formation of the viral envelope
glycoprotein could prevent the initial virus-host cell
interaction or subsequent fusion or could prevent viral
duplication by preventing the construction of the proper
glycoprotein required for the completion of the viral
membrane. Inhibitors of Glucosidase I may be valuable
agents in the treatment of membrane-coated viral disease
and metastatic tumors. S.P. Sunkara et al., Biochem and
Biophys Research Commun. 148(1), 206 (1987); A. Karpas et
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85, 9229 (1977); B.D.
Walker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 8120 (1987).Tumor metastasis is also a process which relies on the
cell surface glycoproteins of a traveling tumor cell to
bind to the cell surface of a distant tissue. The binding
and subsequent cell fusion relies extensively on the cell
surface glycoprotein and clearly
