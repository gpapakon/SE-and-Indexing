<ABSTRACT>
The SQUID sensor device (2) contains a DC SQUID (7) and electronics (21) for amplifying voltage signals produced using the SQUID (7). According to the invention, it is intended for the SQUID (7) to be operated as a detecting SQUID with an electrical fundamental voltage (voltage bias) and to be part of a series circuit having an output coupling coil (11), via which a DC readout SQUID (15) is to be driven inductively using the signals of the detecting SQUID (7), the signals of the DC readout SQUID are to be supplied to the electronics (21) arranged downstream. Advantageously, a preamplifier (22) of the electronics (21) which is directly connected to the readout SQUID (15) can be at room temperature.
