<ABSTRACT>
A method of estimating the directions of 
radiating sources (56,58,60) with respect to an array 

(46) of a number of antenna elements (48), each of 
which elements has a separate gain/phase control (50). 

With nominal gain and phase selected a first estimte of 
the radiating sources directions (ϑ) is accompished by 

application of the MUSIC algorithm (2 ). The algorithm 
is iteratively applied to a microprocessor (54) using 

updated gain and phase values. Iteration is terminated 
at that iteration which produces the maximum difference 

values of the smallest eigenvalue pair of Q
ω
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method and means of radar signal processing for
direction finding purposes, and, more particularly, to
such a method and means especially advantageous for use
with a radar target seeker.A radar seeker operates generally by emitting
radar beam pulses toward a target, measuring the time
traveled by pulses reflected from the target and
adjusting the radar beam for maximum response, which
enables both the direction and distance of the target
to be determined.In the usual situation, there may be other
objects adjacent the sought after target which will
produce radar reflections and, in that way, induce
confusion and error into the tracking system. Also, in
a military context defensive measures are taken to
intentionally interfere with the operation and accuracy
of a radar seeker aboard, say, an aircraft. For
example, large quantities of radar reflecting foil
strips ("window") dropped in the vicinity of a flying
target aircraft can effectively block out radar
detection of the craft. Another frequently employed
radar camouflaging technique for an aircraft consists 
of having one or more escort craft flying near the
target aircraft which direct "jamming" radar beams of
appropriate frequency toward the search radar source to
confuse and induce spurious direction information into
the search tracking system.Direction-finding techniques based upon
eigenstructure methods have been proposed and
experimentally verified and have shown themselves to be
superior to conventional direction-finding equipment
for overcoming standard defensive measures.
Application of eigenstructure techniques requires a
radar system having an active antenna array, that is, a
plurality of antennae arranged in a matrix for sending
and receiving radar pulses over a relatively large area
including a sought after target and which antennae are
controllable as to phase and gain.A more detailed discussion of a prior
eigenstructure method can be found in the article,
"Eigenstructure Methods for Direction Finding with
Sensor Gain and Phase Uncertainties", by Anthony J.
Weiss and Benjamin Friedlander, Proceedings IEEE,
ICASSP 198, New York, New York. This technique
requires at least two sources (i,e., two reflected
radar signals) for proper operation which excludes
applicability to a very frequently encountered
situation, namely, a single-source encounter.
Moreover, in this and in all known prior eigenstructure
techniques precise knowledge of signals received by the
sensor array is required which, in turn,
