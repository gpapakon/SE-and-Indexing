<ABSTRACT>
Process for obtaining photoresist patterns which are not subject to the phenomenon of charge accumulation. The process according to the invention consists in depositing, on a surface of a substrate, a thin film of a photoresist solution containing an oxidising compound, heating the substrate and the thin film in order to obtain a denser photoresist film; forming, by exposure of the photoresist film through a mask, the image of a pattern carried by the mask; developing the image of the pattern in the film of photoresist; and causing a vapour of a reducer monomer to diffuse into the pattern of the photoresist in order to form a copolymerised conducting photoresist pattern on the substrate. Application to the fabrication of integrated circuits.
