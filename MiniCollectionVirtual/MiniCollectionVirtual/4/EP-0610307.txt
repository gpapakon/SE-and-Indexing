<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrosurgical 
device which delivers surgical clips to tissues such as 
ducts or vessels. Ligation or occlusion of ducts, veins, arteries 
or blood vessels is common in many surgical procedures. 
Often it is desirable to do so using one or more 
surgical clips which are intended to remain in place on 
either a temporary or permanent basis. Many designs 
for surgical clips and clip applicating devices are 
well known in the art. Where surgical clips are intended to permanently 
ligate a duct, vein, artery or vessel it is, of course, 
important that the clip not become dislodged or 
displaced over time. However, it is believed that 
approximately 30 percent of all permanently installed 
surgical clips do become dislodged or displaced over 
the course of time. Such dislodgement or displacement 
of the clip can result in the undesirable release of 
fluid or blood. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a surgical 
clip applicating device which enables surgical clips to 
be installed more securely so that they are less prone 
to displacement or dislodgement. Document US-A-4,712,549 discloses an 
electrosurgical device in accordance with the 
pre-characterising part of Claim 1. Furthermore, 
United States Patent Specifications Nos. US-A-4,862,889 
and US-A-4,969,885 disclose supply means for delivery 
of electrosurgical energy.  
 It is thus an object of the invention to 
provide an electrosurgical surgical clip applicating 
device which is able to install surgical clips safely 
and more securely. Another object is to provide a 
clip applicating device which securely bonds a 
surgical clip to adjacent tissue which more securely 
introduces surgical clips to tissue. It is also an 
object to provide a surgical clip applicating device 
which delivers clips in such a way that the clip is 
securely installed and clip-to-tissue fusion and 
tissue-to-tissue fusion are promoted. A further 
object is to provide a method of securely installing 
surgical clips during surgical procedures. Other 
objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art 
upon reading the disclosure which follows. The present invention relates to an 
electrosurgical device for applying surgical clips to 
tissues such as ducts, veins, arteries, and blood 
vessels. The surgical clip applicating device 
includes a handle portion which has a triggering 
mechanism which cooperates with an actuating 
mechanism for deploying surgical clips. Adjacent the 
handle portion is a member, which preferably is 
elongate,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrosurgical clipping device, comprising: 

a handle portion (12) adjacent an elongate 
member (16), the handle portion (12) having a 

triggering means (14) for deploying at least one 
surgical clip (24); 
a means (16) for housing a supply of surgical 
clips within the device; 
a surgical clip delivery means (22a,22b) for 
deploying at least one clip from the device to desired 

tissue, the clip delivery means extending from a distal 
end of the elongate member; 
actuating means (21) for effecting the 
deployment of one or more surgical clips (24) through 

the delivery means (22a,22b) in response to activation 
of the triggering means (14), the actuating means (21) 

connecting between the triggering means (14) and the 
delivery means (22a,22b);
 
   characterised in that there is provided a supply 

means (25) for delivering electrical current from a 
source remote from the clipping device to the delivery 

means (22a,22b) for discharge through the clip (24) to 
tissue contacted by the clip (24); and 
control means (26,30) for selectively activating 
and regulating the electrosurgical energy delivered 

through the energy supply means (25) to the delivery 
means (22a,22b). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
actuating means (21) and the delivery means (22a,22b) 

are made of conductive materials.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the supply means (25) is in electrical 

connection with the actuating means (21) such that 
electrical current is conducted through the actuating 

means (21) to the delivery means (22a,22b). 
A device as claimed in any of claims 1-3 wherein 
the delivery means (22a,22b) comprises at least one 

pair of opposed clamping elements (22a,22b) which 
extend from a distal end of the elongate member (16). 
A device as claimed in any of claims 1-4 wherein 
the supply means (25) comprises an insulated electrical 

wire (25) which extends from a connection port (18) 
disposed on the device to a connection point (28) on 

the actuating means (21). 
A device as claimed in any of claims 1-5 wherein 
the supply means (25) is in electrical communication 

with a voltage determinative, low source impedance 
generator (26) unit which provides electrosurgical 

energy. 
A device as claimed in claim 6 wherein the 
generator (26) provides electrosurgical energy in the 

range of 500-700 KHz. 
A device as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7 
wherein the current delivered to tissue through the 

clip (24) is in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 amps.  
 
A device as claimed in any of claims 6-8 wherein 
the voltage delivered to tissue through the clip (24) 

is in the range of 50 to 100 volts RMS. 
A device as claimed in any of claims 1-9, 
adapted to function as a monopolar electrosurgical 

tool, wherein the surgical clip (24) to be deployed, 
through electrical connection to the delivery means 

(22a,22b), serves as an active, energy-delivering 
electrode, and a remote ground plate (34) serves as a 

return electrode. 
A device as claimed in claim 10 wherein the 
actuating means communicates with first and second 

pairs of opposed clamping elements (40a, 40b, 42a, 42b) 
which extend from a distal end of the elongate member 

(16), and each pair is adapted to engage and close 
separate surgical clips (44,46) for simultaneous 

deployment of the clips. 
A device as claimed in claim 11 wherein the 
first pair of opposed clamping elements (40a, 40b) is 

electrically isolated from the second pair of opposed
