<ABSTRACT>
The dual-band antenna system comprises a dual reflec­
tor antenna rotatable around elevation and azimuth axes, 

having a main reflector (1) and a subreflector (2); first and 
second horn means (24, 25) for radiating first and second 

electromagnetic waves of first and second frequency bands. 
The concave mirrors (5, 4) and the plane mirrors (3, 6) 
being rotatable around the elevation and azimuth axes (EL 

and AZ); and a frequency selective reflector surface means 
(23) provided separately from the beam waveguide means (3 

to 6), for passing the first electromagnetic wave and 
reflecting the second electro-magnetic wave to feed them to 

the plane mirror (6), characterized in that the first and second 
electromagnetic waves radiated from the first and second 

horn means (24, 25) are directly fed to the frequency 
selective reflector surface means (23) and both the first and 

second electromagnetic wave provided from the frequency 
selective reflector surface means (23) are fed to the first 

plane mirror (6) by way of concave mirrors (22, 21). This 
antenna system renders the antenna elevation and azimuth 

angles (EL and AZ) variable with a simple construction and 
without imposing any limitation on the settings of communi­

cation equipment and, also, insures desirable cross polariza­
tion performance and a minimum of loss.
