<ABSTRACT>
Improved asymmetrical microporous hollow fibers incorporating a low molecular weight surfactant and the process for the production of the hollow fibers are disclosed. The hollow fibers have significantly improved flux and rewetting characteristics. The process involves passing a polymeric solution through an outer annulus of die to create an annular stream and a precipitating fluid through the inner orifice of the die creating a stream within the annular stream resulting in hollow fiber formation. The process further involves incorporating a low molecular weight surfactant into the hollow fibers at any one of several stages during the process.

 HOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANE INCORPORATING A SURFACTANT AND PROCESSFOR PREPARING SAMESPECIFICATIONTO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:Be it known that we, Louis C. Cosentino, a resident of Plymouth, Hennepin county, Minnesota, Robert T. Hall II, a resident of Welch, Dakota county, Minnesota, Robert G. Andrus, a resident of New Hope, Hennepin county, Minnesota, Paul D. Brinda a resident of Robbinsdale, Hennepin county, Minnesota and Randal M. Wenthold, a resident of Belle Plain, LeSuer county, Minnesota, all citizens of the United States have invented new and useful improvements in aHOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANE INCORPORATING A SURFACTANT AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME of which the following is a specification. 

 Background of the Invention1. Field of the invention,This invention relates generally to improved asymmetrical microporous hollow fibers incorporating a low molecular weight surfactant and to the process for the production of the hollow fibers. In particular, the invention relates to asymmetrical, microporous hollow fibers having improved flux and rewetting characteristics. The process involves passing a polymeric solution through an outer annulus of die to create an annular stream and passing a precipitating fluid through the inner orifice of the die creating a stream within the annular stream resulting in hollow fiber formation. The process further involves incorporating a low molecular weight surfactant on or into the hollow fibers at any one of several steps during the fiber manufacturing process.2. Description of the Related Art.Microporous, hollow fibers are polymeric capillary tubes having an outside diameters equal to about 1 mm or less and whose walls function as semipermeable membranes. The fibers are useful in separation processes involving transport mainly through sorption and diffusion. Such processes include dialysis, including hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, blood separation, drug release in artificial organs and water filtration. These applications have various requirements including pore size, strength, biocompatibility, cost and speed of production and reproducibility.Conventional art hollow fibers for these uses have typically included regenerated cellulose materials and modified polyacrylonitrile material. However, it is difficult to control the porosity and pore size of these fibers, and for some applications, composite membranes consisting of an ultra-thin layer contiguous with a more porous substrate are needed to provide the necessary strength.Conventional art hollow fiber
