<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the pollutants in the exhaust gas of regeneration plants for used hydrochloric acid from pickling plants, a process is provided including the thermal cleavage of iron chloride in the used pickling acid to give iron oxide and gaseous hydrochloric acid, at least one compound being added to the used pickling acid which contains nitrogen having a low oxidation number, for example ammonium compounds, ammonia, urea or amides.

<CLAIMS>
Process for regeneration of hydrochloric acid from pickling lines 
comprising thermal decomposition of iron chloride in the spent pickling acid into 

iron oxide and gaseous hydrochloric acid, where at least one reducing 
compound is added to the spent pickling acid, characterized by the fact that the 

compound contains nitrogen at an oxidation number having a reducing effect 
on NO, NO
2
 and Cl
2
. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
ammonium compounds, ammonia, urea or amides are used as the reducing 

compound. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by the fact that 
said spent pickling acid is fed to a Venturi washer together with at least one 

compound containing nitrogen at an oxidation number having a reducing effect 
on NO, NO
2
 and Cl
2
 and is then thermally decomposed in a reactor. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that said 
thermal decomposition takes place in a spray roasting reactor. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that said 
thermal decomposition is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized by 
the fact that the off-gas from said thermal decomposition is subjected to 

washing. 
Process according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that said 
washing is carried out using the rinse water from a rinsing plant downstream of 

the pickling plant. 
Process according to claim 6 or 7, characterized by the fact that at 
least one compound containing nitrogen at an oxidation number having a 

reducing effect on NO, NO
2
 and Cl
2
 is added to the rinsing water before 
washing the off-gas from said thermal decomposition. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
by the fact that at least one compound containing nitrogen at an oxidation  

 
number having a reducing effect on NO, NO
2
 and Cl
2,
 is added in at least fivefold, 
preferably ten-fold the stoichiometric quantity in relation to the chlorine 

content and/or in at least double, preferably triple the stoichiometric quantity in 
relation to nitrogen oxides. 
Process according to claim 9, characterized by the fact that said 
compound is added in at least ten-fold the stoichiometric quantity in relation to 

the chlorine content and/or in at least triple the stoichiometric quantity in 
relation to nitrogen oxides.
