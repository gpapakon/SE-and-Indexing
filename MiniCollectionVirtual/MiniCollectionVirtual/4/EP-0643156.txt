<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photo-electric
chemical apparatus and particularly to a photo-electric
chemical apparatus for generating hydrogen and oxygen from
water by utilizing light energy.It has long been known that water is decomposed to
oxygen and hydrogen in a photo-electric chemical apparatus
structured such that an n-type semiconductor electrode
and a platinum electrode are soaked into an electrolyte
is irradiated with a light beam (for example, "Nature",
No. 283, p37, by Fujishima et al. 1972). Such a phenomenon
occurs due to the fact that charge separation of electrons
and holes caused by irradiation of the light beam on the
semiconductor results from a Schottky-barrier-type field
distribution at the interface between the semiconductor
and the electrolyte. When the semiconductor electrode
is irradiated with the light beam with the semiconductor
electrode being connected with the platinum electrode
through a lead wire, electrons pushed out of a conduction
band of the semiconductor electrode are accumulated in the
platinum electrode, thereby causing the platinum electrode
to charge in the direction of negative potential. If a
voltage difference between both electrodes is equal to or
higher than 1.23 Ev which is required for decomposition of
water and an electric potential of the platinum electrode
is more negative than the reduction level of the hydrogen
ion, water is decomposed, resulting in the generation of
oxygen and hydrogen. Actually, hydrogen is generated when
an electric potential of the platinum electrode goes in
the negative direction further from the reduction voltage
of the hydrogen ion beyond a hydrogen overvoltage of the
platinum. It is noted that a platinum electrode is often
used because a hydrogen overvoltage of the platinum is low,
that is, platinum is a metal having an electric potential 
for hydrogen ion reduction which is the closest to
a theoretical value.Typically, titanium dioxide is used as a semiconductor
electrode for the electrolysis of water,
because it has a wide band gap and is very stable in
the electrolyte.However, since a flat band potential of a titanium
dioxide semiconductor is substantially equal to a reduction
potential of hydrogen ion, a potential of the titanium
dioxide semiconductor must come nearer to the flat band
condition in order to cause hydrogen ion reduction. But,
electrons and holes generated by light beam are not
immediately separated and, if separated, couple again at
a high rate, causing a photo current to become remarkably
small. For
