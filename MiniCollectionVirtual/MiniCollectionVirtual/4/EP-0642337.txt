<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to the novel use of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone and its didextrose sulfonate derivative and other closely related sulfones in the treatment of dementia (Alzheimer's disease). A method of treating dementia in a human being characterized by administering to the human being a therapeutic daily to weekly amount of a substance selected from the group consisting of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, its didextrose sulfonate derivative, and other closely related sulfone derivatives, and therapeutically acceptable salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the novel use of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone 
and its didextrose sulfonate derivative 
and closely related anti-lepromatous sulfones in the 
treatment of dementia (Alzheimer's disease) in human 
beings. Alzheimer's Disease is by far the most common 
cause of primary dementia. Either by itself, or in combination 
with multiple infarcts, it accounts for almost 80% 
of all cases. No treatment has been established which will 
prevent the onset or delay the progression of Alzheimer's 
Disease. It is possible that known drugs would have an as 
yet unrecognized efficacy in this respect. 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (Dapsone™) and its 
didextrose sulfonate derivative (Promine™) were first shown 
to have a favourable effect in treating rat leprosy in 1941 
(Cowdry and Ruangsiri, Arch. Pathol. 32:632, 1941). 
Successful clinical trials for the treatment of human 
leprosy followed and these two components are now the most 
important anti-leprosy drugs. The two drugs have since 
been used for treating a variety of skin diseases such as 
dermatitis herpetiformis and efficacy has been reported in 
several disorders of presumed autoimmune origin such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus and Behcet's 
disease. Dapsone™ is a drug that has been used worldwide 
for over 40 years. It has been found to have few side 
effects and these are well understood due to extensive 
experience with patients taking the drug continuously for 
many years. To the applicants' knowledge, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone 
and its didextrose sulfonate derivative, 
and closely related antilepromatous sulfones have never 
been used or considered for the treatment of dementia. Leprosy is no longer a fatal disorder, due in 
substantial measure to treatment with Dapsone™. It has 
anti-inflammatory action, which may seem paradoxical for  
 
treatment of an infectious disease. However, M.leprae 
survives in macrophages, and one of the deleterious 
consequences of the infection, which is reduced by Dapsone, 
is widespread amyloidosis. Dapsone has also been reported 
to be effective for the treatment of various presumed 
autoimmune diseases, including dermatitis herpetiformis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, polymyalgia 
rheumatica, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, Behcet's disease 
and polyarteritis nodosa. The alternative antileprosy 
drugs, clofazimine and rifampicin, have also been reported 
to have efficacy in anti-inflammatory therapeutic 
applications. The invention pertains to the use of a substance 
selec

<CLAIMS>
The use of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, the didextrose 
sulfonate derivative of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (glucosulfone 

sodium), or other closely related sulfone derivatives such as 
sulfoxone sodium, sulfetrone sodium and thiazolsulfone, and 

therapeutically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in 
the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation for treating 

dementia in a human being characterized by administering to the 
human being a therapeutic daily to weekly amount of the 

formulation. 
The use as claimed in claim 1 wherein the formulation 
is administered to the human being at a dosage rate equivalent to 

between about 50 mg and 300 mg per day of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone 
or its equivalent in molecular 

concentration for other sulfone derivatives. 
The use of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, the didextrose 
sulfonate derivative of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (glucosulfone 

sodium) or other closely related sulfone derivatives such as 
sulfoxone sodium, sulfetrone sodium and thiazolsulfone and 

therapeutically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in 
the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation in a package 

together with a notification that the pharmaceutical formulation 
can be used in a therapeutic amount for treating dementia in a 

human being. 
The use as claimed in claim 3 wherein the notification 
indicates that the treatment comprises administering the 

formulation to the human being at a dosage rate equivalent to  
 

between about 50 mg and 300 mg per day of 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone 
or its equivalent in molecular 

concentration for other sulfone derivatives. 
The use as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 , 
wherein the substance is 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone. 
The use as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the substance is the didextrose sulfonate derivative of 

4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone.
