<DESCRIPTION>
 HAND-HELD, MULTI-PURPOSE PORTABLE STEAMERFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an apparatus for using the physical and the therapeutic properties of steam and vapor, as well as the use of steam and vapor along with direct physical contact of the apparatus with the skin, and also the use of the apparatus spaced away at a reasonable distance so as to still get the effect of the steam and vapor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSteam has long been used for treating the body owing to the therapeutic effects of moisture-laden vapor for treating skin and hair.For example, the use of steam in hair treatment allows the hair fibers to be moistened and facilitates setting, shaping, and drying of the hair.The use of steam in skin treatment is generally known, such as applied at steam baths for causing perspiration and opening of the pores. The use of steam as a body treatment aids in relaxing muscles, and helps to cleanse the skin through heating of the natural body oils to a more liquified state in which removal of the 

oils is facilitated as by wiping or washing away the oils.It is known also that dead skin cells of the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) are easily exfoliated by moistening and loosening them and then wiping or washing away the dead skin cells.It is also known that many people find it easier to remove make-up after having showered or bathed, as the make-up to be removed has been softened owing to the action of warm water and/or steam thereon.U.S. Patent No. 4,399,349 to Deming et al. discloses an electrically heated facial sauna appliance having a heater such as a ceramic resistance or positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heater enclosed in an aluminum case. A thermostat calibrated to about 100° - 110°C is attached to the Deming heater. A fan is used to propel the steam toward the face. Deming et al. generally describe putting water or aqueous solutions or emulsions containing medicaments, colognes or perfumes, moisturizers, and the like, into a water tank steam generating chamber. None of the attachments in Deming et al. Figs. 5-8 is driven.U.S. Patent No. 3,800,810 to Mercer discloses an appliance construction for use as a hair dressing tool and a steam iron that schematically shows a tool or implement which may be a brush, comb, or the like, advantageously formed with passageways (not shown) through the comb back or brush back for passing fluid from the interior of a work head exteriorly thereof. Mercer describes the application of steam to hair for shaping hair in hair-dressing and
