<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to memories for 
computers and other electronic devices, and more 
particularly, to flash memories and circuits that 
control the threshold voltage distribution of the flash 
memories after erase. Flash EPROMs (erasable programmmable read only 
memories) are a growing class of non-volatile storage 
integrated circuits. These flash EPROMs have the 
capability of electrically erasing, programming or 
reading a memory cell in the chip. The entire array 
can be simultaneously erased electrically. The flash 
EPROM can also be randomly read or written. 
The cells themselves use only a single device per 
cell and are formed using so-called floating gate 
transistors in which the data is stored in a cell by 
charging or discharging the floating gate. The 
floating gate is a conductive material, typically made 
of polysilicon, which are insulated from the channel of 
the transistor by a thin layer of oxide or other 
insulating material, and insulated from the control 
gate word line of the transistor by a second layer of 
insulating material. The act of charging the floating gate is termed  
 
the "program" step for a flash EPROM. This is 
accomplished through a so-called hot-electron injection 
by establishing a large positive voltage between the 
gate and source, as much as 12 volts, and a positive 
voltage between the drain and source, for instance, 7 
volts. The act of discharging the floating gate is called 
the "erase" function for a flash EPROM. This erasure 
function is typically carried out by a Fowler-Nordheim 
tunneling mechanism between the floating gate and the 
source of the transistor (source erase) or between the 
floating gate and the substrate (channel erase). For 
instance, a source erase operation is induced by 
establishing a large positive voltage from the source 
to gate, while floating the drain of the respective 
memory cell. This positive voltage may be as much as 
12 volts. Figure 1 depicts a schematic of a section of a 
memory array. Memory cells, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 
are depicted in Figure 1. Column 1 is coupled to the 
drain of memory cell 10 and the drain of memory cell 
25. Column 2 is coupled to the drain of memory cell 15 
and the drain of memory cell 30. Column 3 is coupled 
to the drain of memory cell 20 and the drain of memory 
cell 35. Row 4 is coupled to the gate of memory cell 
10, the gate of memory cell 15, and the gate of memory 
cell 20. Row 5 is coupled to the gate of memory cell 
25, the gate of memory cell 30, and the gate of
