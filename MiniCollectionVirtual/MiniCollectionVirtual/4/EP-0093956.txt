<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter for frequencies higher than 
VHF band comprising a closed conductive housing (112), a 

pair of input and output means provided at both the extreme 
ends of said housing (112), a dielectric body (111) with a 

plurality of linear parallel grooves (118) arranged in said 
housing (112), a plurality of conductive linear means (113) 

with the length of approximately 1/4 wavelength mounted in 
said dielectric body (111) between said grooves (118) so that 

one end of said resonators (113) is fixed to the common 
plane of the housing (112), a capacitor means (114, 115) 

provided between the other end of resonators (111, 113, 118) 
and said conductive housing (112) so that an electrode (115) 

of said capacitor may be trimmed by a laser beam to adjust 
the resonating frequency of each of said resonators (111, 

113, 118) and a plurality of conductive rods (137) provided 
in said grooves (118) for improving the 
spurious characterisÂ­
tics of the filter.
