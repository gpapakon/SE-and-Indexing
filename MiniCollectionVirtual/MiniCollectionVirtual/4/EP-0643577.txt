<ABSTRACT>
A compound having an aromatic or heterocyclic ring with at least one primary amine group NH2 and at least one sulphydryl group SH directly attached to the ring, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of a complement related disorder or for reducing the risk of graft rejection. Complement related disorders include autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and rheumatism, myocardial infarction and tissue damage associated with radiotherapy. Examples for the compounds are 2-aminothiophenol and 4-aminothiophenol.

<DESCRIPTION>
USE OF AMINOTHIOPHENOLS IN THE TREATMENT OF DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEMThe present invention relates to drugs for the treatment of conditions aggravated or caused by 5 complement as a source of inflammatory mediators. An area of particular importance is autoimmune diseases and especially a group of autoimmune diseases known as the Arthritides which includes arthritis and rheumatism. The compounds of the invention will also10 be useful in treatment of myocardial infarction, as radioprotective agents in treatment of patients undergoing radiotherapy, and to help prevent graft rejection in transplant patients. Complement activation is known to have an adverse role in these15 situations (25, 26) .Available drugs presently used to treat arthritis and rheumatism have toxic side effects that often prohibit their use after only a few weeks. Penicillamine, a commonly used drug, causes serious20 proteinuria in up to 30% of patients. The toxic side effects can resemble the symptoms of the autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) , which include vasculitis, joint pains, rash and nephritis. The symptoms of SLE can be understood not so much in25 terms of specificities of the antibodies which are found but more in the formation of immune complexes between antibody and antigen.Other drugs are associated with SLE or "immune complex disease" as an adverse side-effect30 (12). Hydralazine, administered for hypertension, procainamide for cardiac arrhythmia and phenytoin for epilepsy are all examples.Immune complex diseases, whether of the SLE type or drug-induced, are considered to be disorders35 of immune complex handling. An individual becomes unable to deal successfully with an immune complex 

load and the result is immune complex deposition at inappropriate tissue sites such as small blood vessels and kidney glomeruli leading to tissue damage. Immune complexes are formed in all individuals but in healthy people they are removed through the reticuloendothelial system and removal is promoted through activation of the complement cascade (1). Subcellular components e.g. DNA and mitochondria, released from damaged tissue will also directly activate the classical complement pathway.When the complement cascade is activated through the classical pathway, components C1 , C2 and C4 become activated and a complex enzyme C3 convertase, consisting of C4b2a, is generated on the complement-activating surface. C3 which is activated, in turn becomes bound to the immune complex surface. Covalent binding
