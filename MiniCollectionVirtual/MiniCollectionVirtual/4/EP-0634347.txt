<ABSTRACT>
A device formed by a plurality of metal cores (51) 
having at the top hard metal scraper bits (1), said cores (51) 

being parallel but not in contact with each other and embedded 
in a one-piece block (45) of polyurethane, rubber or other 

elastomeric material, connected to a positioning shaft (8) by 
means of a housing pocket (5), and placed close to the belt 

conveyor drum. In order to automatically compensate for the 
wear of the scraper bits (1) the positioning shaft (8) is 

connected to the conveyor by an elastic suspension and a pair 
of hinge joints fixed to side brackets (56) placed on the 

frame. The arrangement for securing the block (45) to the 
housing pocket (5) causes a marked upwardly bending thereof, 

thus forcing the embedded cores (51) and therefore the scraper 
bits (1) to arrange themselves along a broken line tangent to 

the block bending.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for scraping 
the surface of belt conveyors. It is known that more or less thick deposits accumulate 
over the surfaces of belt conveyors, depending on the 
stickiness of the conveyed materials. Presently the most common devices used for cleaning the 
belt surface include scrapers substantially formed by a 
plurality of plates carrying blade-shaped scrapers - usually 
of steel - at the ends contacting the belt, to remove the 
material accumulated over the belt by means of a scraping 
action. The scrapers or cleaning devices actually on the market 
are generally provided with plates each pivotally mounted on 
rubber springs, and this arrangement results in a quick 
deterioration of their elastic properties because of the 
hysteresis of the elastomeric material they are made of, when 
the belt operating speed is faster than 3 m/s. Moreover in all cases the blades and the associated 
elastic members are carried by a pipe rigidly connected to the 
conveyor frame, thus requiring interventions for adjusting the 
whole system as the scrapers wear out. The object of the present invention is that to overcome  
 
said shortcomings by providing a decidly more convenient and 
rational scraping device, that does not require particular and 
frequent adjustments, said device being further provided with 
scraping members capable of automatically self-adjusting and 
continuosly adapting themselves to the belt conveyor moving 
surface. In case of reversible belts, it is known that the 
existing scrapers for such belts do not allow for an automatic 
disengagement of the scraping devices which continue to 
operate and therefore wear out the scraper members when the 
running direction of the belt is reversed. It is quite common the case in which a cleaning action 
is required on the upper surface of the belt lower (or return) 
section in order to intercept also the material that has 
fallen down from the transporting section. In some cases, it may be desirable that two scraping 
devices are located in series on the same scraper for an 
increased cleaning action. The scraping device for belt conveyors according to the 
present invention provides therefore for four main embodiments 
that although employing the same inventive idea, differ from 
each other for some specific features due to the different 
requirements of the above mentioned conveyors. The scraping device for belt conveyors according the 
present invention substantially comprises a one-piece block of  
 
polyurethane,
