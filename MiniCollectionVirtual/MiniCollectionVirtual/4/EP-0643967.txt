<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in and 
relating to pharmaceutical compositions. More 
particularly, the invention is concerned with 
pharmaceutical compositions comprising an opioid 
analgesic, for example morphine. It is well known that opioid analgesics, as typified 
by morphine, have a constipatory effect when orally 
administered. In order to overcome this problem it has 
been proposed to administer opioid analgesics together 
with a laxative in the same unit dosage form. It is 
also known that laxatives such as bisacodyl can cause 
abdominal discomforts such as colic or cramp. It is 
recommended in order to avoid such gastric irritation 
that these tablets be enteric coated (see Martindale, 
The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th Edition, Academic Press, 
1993). It has now been found, in accordance with the 
present invention, that, unexpectedly, administration of 
an opioid analgesic such as morphine in conjunction with 
a stimulant laxative whilst reducing the constipatory 
effect of the opioid analgesic also reduces the unwanted 
side-effects of the laxative without recourse to enteric 
coating.  According to the invention, therefore, there is 
provided a pharmaceutical composition for oral 
administration containing, as active ingredients, 
(i) an opioid analgesic or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof, and (ii) a stimulant laxative. Typical stimulant laxatives for use in accordance 
with the invention include bisacodyl, casanthranol, 
cascara, danthron, senna and the sennosides, and sodium 
picosulphate. Of these, bisacodyl is generally 
preferred. Typical opioid analgesics for use in accordance 
with the invention include morphine, hydromorphone, 
dihydrocodeine, and diamorphine. A particularly 
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt of morphine is 
morphine sulphate but, of course, other pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts may be used such as the hydrochloride, 
acetate or tartrate. When using morphine and bisacodyl as active 
ingredients, the weight ratio of morphine (calculated as 
morphine sulphate) to bisacodyl in the compositions of 
the invention is suitably from 100:1 to 1:1, preferably 
40:1 to 3:1. When, as is preferred as is discussed 
below, the composition of the invention is in dosage  
 
unit form, the dose of morphine (calculated as morphine 
sulphate) is suitably, for example, 30 mg/dosage unit 
form. As a result, the dose of bisacodyl is suitably 
2.5 to 30 mg/dosage unit. Where other stimulant laxatives are employed in 
place of bisacodyl, the amount of
