<ABSTRACT>
A terminal pin (18) for electrical connection, 
comprises an elongate body constituted of electrically 

conductive material in solid cross-section throughout the 
length of the body, the body having a first portion (18a) 

extending from adjacent one end of the body longitudinally 
to a location distal from an opposite end of the body and 

exhibiting at least one longitudinally extending marginal 
part defining an apex, the body having a second portion 

(18b) extending from adjacent the body opposite end to a 
location distal from the body one end and exhibiting a 

longitudinally extending marginal part defining an arcuate 
surface in alignment with the apex of the body member first 

portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrical connectors 
and pertains more particularly to improvements in apparatus and 
methods for interconnection of headers and like electrical 
components to other electrical components, such as printed circuit 
boards. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a currently widespread 
connection arrangement encompasses a so-called "square cross-section" 
electrical terminal pin 10, in the form of an elongate 
body of electrically conductive material so shaped in manufacture 
as to define apices, one being identified as 10a, with flat surface 
expanses extending between adjacent apices, one such flat surface 
expanse being identified as 10b. The square cross-sectional 
configuration of terminal pin 10 is dictated by the interior 
configuration of a socket intended for receipt of the terminal pin 
and electrical connection therewith. Terminal pin 10 is typically 
provided in a plurality, arranged in one or more rows having a 
given number of terminal pins. It is customary to mold a plastic 
body, such as a header, partly indicated at 12 in section, as 
molded about the terminal pin plurality which is maintained in 
desired position in the course of the molding operation. It is customary to seat the header on a printed circuit 
board (PCB), partly indicated at 14 in section, such that the 
terminal pins 10 come into electrical engagement electrically 
conductive eyelets 16, having portions 16a which are centrally 
apertured to receive the terminal pins. In present commercial 
practice, terminal pins 10 are configured throughout the 
longitudinal extent thereof, excepting conical end sections 10c and 
10d, fully in square cross-section. The dimensioning of the 
terminal pins between apices at one hundred and eighty degrees, 
i.e., apex 10a and its rearward counterpart in Fig. 1, is selected 
to be in excess of the interior diameter of eyelet portions 16a. 
The connection attained thus involves entry of the apices into 
matter of the eyelets, giving rise desirably to airtight electrical 
connection and retentive force maintaining the connection. At the  
 
least, the securement of components attendant on the apex-eyelet 
engagement assures readiness for attendant solder-assisted 
electrical connection. The connector industry has otherwise addressed the 
insertion force problem, i.e., by looking to terminal pins 
specially fabricated not in solid cross-section throughout, such as 
"compliant" terminal pins. Examples of this approach are seen in 
U.S. Patents No. 4,857,019, No.
