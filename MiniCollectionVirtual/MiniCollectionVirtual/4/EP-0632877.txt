<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
self-cooling fluid containers and specifically to an
internal self-cooling beverage container.Heretofore, self-cooling beverage containers
have not met with widespread commercial success owing
to a variety of design deficiencies. Complexity of
design structure has rendered many known devices as
impractical. Safety, in some cases, has presented a
concern. The opportunity for contact between the
refrigerant and beverage creates a risk of altering
beverage quality at best and toxicity to the consumer
at worst. Further, other known devices wherein the
refrigerant is vented in association with the tab
opening of the container presented a serious safety
hazard. When vented, the evaporating refrigerant was
expelled upwards towards the face of the consumer
with liquid particles of refrigerant being borne
within the refrigerant vapor. This problem was
addressed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,852,975 to Beck which
teaches a container provided with a safety shield to
protect the consumer from the upwardly expelled
spray. Inefficiency of refrigeration and/or
environmental concerns have been other deficiencies
of known devices. Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide an efficient, simple,
consumer-convenient and economical self-cooling fluid
container which will overcome the aforesaid problems
of the prior art.It is a further object of the present
invention to provide a self-cooling beverage
container, not only well-adapted for the
"outdoorsmen", but as an economical alternative to
the use of auxiliary refrigeration.It is a further object of the present
invention to provide an "ecology-friendly",
self-cooling beverage container which is adapted for
the use of new, non-toxic and ozone-neutral
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and which is readily
recyclable after use.EP-A-0 279 971 discloses a self cooling container according
to the preamble of claim 1. The present invention is characterized
by the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1.These objects are realized in one
embodiment of the present invention comprising a
beverage container of conventional exterior
dimensions, readily adaptable to existing packaging,
stacking, transporting and handling needs. An upper
chamber containing the beverage to be cooled is
axially provided with a refrigerant chamber affixed
to the base of the upper chamber and extending at
least partially into the upper chamber. The interior
region of the refrigerant chamber is fluidicly
isolated from the interior region of the upper
chamber.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A self-cooling container (10) for fluids, comprising:

A. a first chamber (12) including walls for defining a
fluid region interior thereto,
B. a second chamber (30) including walls for defining a
refrigerant region interior thereto, said refrigerant region

extending at least partially into said fluid region and being
thermally coupled to said fluid region, and said refrigerant

region being fluidicly isolated from said fluid region,
C. refrigerant dispersal assembly including:

i. means for forming a third chamber (21) including walls
(22, 27) for defining a dispersal region interior

thereto, said dispersal region including a first
portion adjacent to said refrigerant region and

separated therefrom by a coupling portion (32) of said
walls of said refrigerant region and including a

second portion adjacent to said fluid region and
separated therefrom, said third chamber (21) being

vented to regions exterior to said container, and
ii. cooling activation means for selectively forming a
fluidic path (29) from said refrigerant region to said

dispersal region through said coupling portion (32) of
said walls of said refrigerant region;

the container being characterized in that:

the second portion of the dispersal region and said fluid
region are separated by a coupling portion (11) of said walls of

said fluid region, said dispersal region and said fluid region
being thermally coupled through said coupling portion of said

walls of said fluid region for additionally cooling, in use, a
fluid in said fluid region through said coupling portion of said

walls of said fluid region.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 1 wherein
said cooling activation means includes a perforation member (26)

supported by one of said walls (27) defining said dispersal
region and extending therefrom into said dispersal region toward 

said coupling portion (32) of said walls of said refrigerant
region, and

wherein said wall (27) supporting said perforation member (26)
is displaceable in response to an externally, selectively applied

force to establish motion of said perforation member (26),
thereby piercing said coupling portion (
32) of said walls of said
refrigerant region, and forming said fluidic path.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 1 or 2
further comprising a predetermined amount of pressurized

refrigerant in said refrigerant region.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 2 wherein
said perforation member has a tapered, pointed portion extending

therefrom into said dispersal region toward said coupling portion
(32) of said walls of said refrigerant, and wherein


said tapered pointed portion pierces said coupling portion (32)
of said walls of said refrigerant region and forms said fluidic

path.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 2 or 4,
wherein said first chamber (12) is cylindrical having two

opposite ends and said chamber (30) is located axially within
said first chamber (12) at one end thereof and wherein said first

chamber (12) includes an openable port at the end opposite said
one end for dispensing said fluid therefrom.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 5 wherein
said coupling portion of said wall of said refrigerant region is

a perforatable seal.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 4 wherein
said first chamber (12) is substantially cylindrical and said

second chamber (30) extends from one end of said first chamber
(12). 
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 7 wherein
said second chamber (30) is substantially cylindrical and is

substantially coaxial with said first chamber.
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 4 wherein
said displacement of said perforation member (26) is guided by

a threaded connection (23a, 23b) between said first chamber (12)
and said third chamber (21).
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 4 wherein
said displacement of said perforation member (26) is guided by

a bead-and-groove connection (24a, 24b) between said first
chamber (12) and second chamber (30).
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 4 wherein
said displacement of said perforation member (26) is established

by deformation of said wall (27) of said third chamber (21)
supporting said perforation member (26).
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 1 or 4
wherein said third chamber (21) forming means includes a cup-shaped

member and means for detachably coupling said cup-shaped
member to said first chamber (12), whereby an exterior surface

of said walls of said first chamber (12) and an interior surface
of said cup-shaped member cooperatively form said third chamber

(21).
A self-cooling container in accordance with claim 12 wherein
said perforation member (26) is disposed on said cup-shaped

member and extends therefrom into said dispersal region.
A self-cooling container as claimed in any of the preceding
claims and including a fluid, the fluid being a beverage.
