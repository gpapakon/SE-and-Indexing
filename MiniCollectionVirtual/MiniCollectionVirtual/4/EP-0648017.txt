<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for monitoring the phase shift between any two clock signals from among several clock signals (CK1-CKn) of the same frequency. The two clock signals of each possible pair of clock signals respectively enable two successive flip-flops (50, 51) which are initially in separate states, the set of flip-flops being connected in a looped-back shift-register configuration. An alarm signal (AL) is supplied by an exclusive OR gate (43, 53) receiving the outputs of two successive flip-flops of the shift register.

<CLAIMS>
A device for checking the skew between two clock 
signals among a plurality of clock signals (CK1-CKn) having 

the same frequency, characterized in that the two clock 
signals of each possible pair of clock signals respectively 

enable two successive flip-flops (40, 41; 50, 51) initially 
set at distinct states, in a set of flip-flops connected in a 

looped shift register configuration, and in that an alarm 
signal (AL) is provided by an Exclusive-OR gate (43, 53) 

receiving the outputs of two successive flip-flops of the 
shift register. 
The checking device of claim 1, wherein the state of 
the alarm signal is stored in a flip-flop (54) that is 

enabled by the complement of one (CK1) of the clock signals.
