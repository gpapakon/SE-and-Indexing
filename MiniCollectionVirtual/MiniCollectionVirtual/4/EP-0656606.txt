<ABSTRACT>
Plural types of fixed format data for printing on a 
label tape are previously stored in a ROM (29) in a label 

printer. The label printer displays a menu for selecting a 
fixed format on a display section (15). A user operates a 

key input section (13) to select a fixed format and then 
input character data. The input character data is printed 

on a label tape in accordance with a format based on 
selected fixed format data. Therefore, the printing 

apparatus can easily input data and prepare elaborate label 
tapes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing apparatus
and a printing method which can print data using a fixed
format with a simple operation.There are label printers which prepare label tapes to
stick on audio cassettes, video cassettes, floppy disks,
name plates, furnishings, etc.With the use of the conventional label printers, a
user should input character data to be printed, should set
a detailed format including the length and width of a label
tape, vertical writing/horizontal writing, a block-by-block
form and a character size one by one and then
should print input character data on the label tape
according to the set format.The conventional label printers involve a troublesome
task of inputting data, particularly, format setting data,
do not allow users to easily prepare elaborate label tapes.Further, depending on the width of the label tape in
use, printing may not be executed according to the set
format data, making the setting of the format difficult.
The same problem also arises in selecting the frame, so
that printing may not be executed according to the selected
frame data.Document EP-A-0 297 568 describes a label printer that includes a thermal printer
section and a keyboard. The label printer further includes an I/O port to which a
memory card storing information of label issuing condition including a preset number
of printing formats is electrically connected, and a printing control circuit including a
CPU, ROM, RAM and printer controller and for selectively reading out print format
data from the memory card when it is detected that the memory card is connected to
the I/O port, setting a print format corresponding to the read out printing format data,
and driving the thermal printer section to print printing data supplied from the
keyboard according to the said printing format (cf. preamble of claim 1).Document US-A-4 936 693 describes a label printing device that comprises a
keyboard having a plurality of numeral keys for inputting an article code, a data
generator for generating data necessary for the formation of bar code data according
to the article code, a printer and a control unit for forming bar code data having an
arrangement predetermined by a bar code format read out from the memory
according to data from said data generator and causing the printer to print the bar
code data on label. In the memory are stored different bar code formats
corresponding to a plurality of operation modes including registration and training.
The control unit reads out, according to the input
