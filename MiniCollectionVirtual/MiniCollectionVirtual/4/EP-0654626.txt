<ABSTRACT>
A joint for mating exhaust pipes includes an 
exhaust pipe flange gasket (11) with a metallic body (12) 

having a planar portion (18) extending laterally inwardly 
from an outer edge (20) of the body, the planar portion 

(18) having at least one bolt hole (16), and a shielding 
grommet (26) integrally connected to an inner edge of the 

planar portion (18). The shielding grommet (26) defines an 
outer periphery (28) of an aperture (14), and a sealing 

element (46) is retained within the grommet. The gasket 
(11) is disposed between two mating exhaust pipes (62,64) 

each pipe having a flange (66,68) with an aperture (90,92) 
and a planar clamping face, at least one of the 

flanges including a recess (74,76) adjacent the clamping 
face (70,72). The planar portion (18) of the gasket (11) is 

disposed between the faces (70,72) such that when the 
apertures (90,92) of the members are aligned with the 

bolt hole (16), the shielding grommet is received in the 
recess (74,76).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gasket and more 
particularly to a joint for mating exhaust pipes, the joint 
including an exhaust pipe flange gasket with a body having a 
planar portion and a shielding grommet which retains a gasket 
sealing element. An exhaust pipe flange gasket bears a clamping load 
from a bolted joint involving the connection of two pipe-like 
members having flanges and opposing planar faces. The gasket 
relies upon that load to prevent exhaust gases and other 
materials from escaping through the joint from one member to the 
other. One known gasket comprises composite material which 
compresses under installation pressure, causing mating flanges 
to deform and bend. A non-uniform sealing stress distribution 
may be created, depending on the degree of flange deformation 
and the corresponding variable gasket compression. Further, the 
material is exposed to exhaust gases that can degrade the 
composite material. A shielding grommet may be added, but 
higher stresses resulting from the grommet may aggravate the 
flange deformation. Another known ring-like gasket requires a machined 
groove or recess in the mating flange for the proper 
installation of the gasket. Gasket stress and compression are 
determined by the construction of the gasket and the depth of 
the recess. When the gasket is fully compressed in the recess, 
a positive metal to metal lock may be achieved at mating  
 
opposing planar faces of the flanges to minimize bending. 
However, the installation location of the gasket is dependent on 
the location of the recess and the ability to maintain gasket 
position during installation. One method of devising a positive 
lock location of the gasket is to create an interference fit 
between an inner diameter of the recess and the minor inner 
diameter of an elliptically shaped ring-like gasket. Close 
tolerances are required between the machined recess and the 
gasket. A ring-like gasket may also be installed over an 
extended length pipe-like member having a planar face adapted to 
mate with a planar face of a corresponding member. For most 
applications, however, alignment of the respective opposing 
planar faces is extremely difficult because of the extended 
length of the pipe-like member. Further, interference fits are 
difficult because of outer diameter variability related to the 
pipe-like member. Finally, a ring-like gasket may be installed in a 
recess of a flanged pipe-like member and held in place by 
gravity. However, the member is usually angled during
