<ABSTRACT>
The iontophoretic device or patch (10) of the present invention includes an electrode assembly (12), having at least one electrode, an electrode reservoir (14) and at least one drug reservoir (16), which are held or contained within a pouch or other suitable structure (18). It should be appreciated that a return electrode may be combined in the assembly (12) or separately provided as is well known in the art. The device is divided or otherwise separated into two portions, one portion (20) (first) includes the electrode assembly (12) and the electrode reservoir (14) with the electrode reservoir being situated adjacent to the electrode assembly and holding an electrolyte (26). The other portion (22) (second) includes the drug reservoir (16) which holds the medication or drug (28), preferably in an ionized or ionizable form, to be delivered iontophoretically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to iontophoretic devices for delivering drugs or medicines to patients
transdermally, i.e., through the skin, and more specifically relates to an iontophoretic device capable of being activated
by the user.Transdermal drug delivery systems have, in recent years, become an increasingly important means of administering
drugs. Such systems offer advantages clearly not achievable by other modes of administration such as avoiding
introduction of the drug through the gastrointestinal tract or punctures in the skin to name a few.Presently, there are two types of transdermal drug delivery systems, i.e., "Passive" and "Active." Passive systems
deliver drug through the skin of the user unaided, an example of which would involve the application of a topical anesthetic
to provide localized relief, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,814,095 (Lubens). Active systems on the other hand
deliver drug through the skin of the user using iontophoresis, which according to Stedman's Medical Dictionary, is
defined as "the introduction into the tissues, by means of an electric current, of the ions of a chosen medicament."Conventional iontophoretic devices, such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,820,263 (Spevak et al.),
4,927,408 (Haak et al.) and 5,084,008 (Phipps), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, for
delivering a drug or medicine transdermally through iontophoresis, basically consist of two electrodes -- an anode and
a cathode. Usually, electric current is driven from an external supply into the skin at the anode, and back out at the cathode.
Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in iontophoresis to perform delivery of drugs for a variety of purposes.
Two such examples, involve the use of Novocaine, which is usually injected prior to dental work to relieve pain,
and Lidocaine, which is usually applied as a topical, local anesthetic.However, several disadvantages and limitations have been associated with the use of such devices, including storage
stability as a result of the drug not being in a form suitably stable to provide a commercially practical shelf life. Upon
storage for extended periods, the therapeutic agents can degrade and become less potent. In addition, such devices
have not delivered an efficient dosage of the drug resulting in poor performance and a need for larger amounts of the
drug, which upon completion of the application is wasted. Accordingly, such devices have been generally impractical for
use on outpatients and in

<CLAIMS>
A user activated device (10) delivering at least one medication (28) to an applied area of a patient, comprising:

   an electrode assembly means (12) for driving a medication (28) into the applied area of the patient to be
absorbed by the body of the patient;

   wherein the electrode assembly (12) is situated in electrical communication with a first reservoir (14) which
contains a substantially hydrated electrolyte;


a second reservoir (16) containing a substantially non-hydrated medication (28) to be delivered to the applied
area of the patient;
a first holding means (20) for holding the electrode assembly means (12) and the first reservoir (14), said first
holding means (20) including a means for maintaining the electrode assembly means (12) in electrical communication

with the first reservoir (14); a second holding means (22) including a means for holding the second reservoir
(16) and including a means for maintaining the second reservoir (16) separate in relation to the first 

reservoir (14); the first holding means (20) and the second holding means (22) each having a release liner (36,240,336,536,537,636,637)
for sealing the first holding means (20) and the second holding means (16) so that prior to activation the second

reservoir (16) containing the medication (28) is isolated from the first reservoir (14) and maintained in a
non-hydrated condition to prevent degradation and dilution of the medication contained in the second reservoir

(16); the device (10) being activatable by removing the release liner (36) and placing the first reservoir (14) in
contact with the second reservoir (16), thereby to at least partially hydrate the medication (28) contained in the

second reservoir (16) and to bring the first reservoir (14) and the second reservoir (16) into electrical communication
with one another, and in which either (a)

said first holding means (20) and said second holding
means (22) are hingedly connected together along a bendable member (34) so that the device (10) may be activated

by folding the holding means (20,22) along the bendable member (34) to bring the first reservoir (14) and the
second reservoir (16) into electrical communication or (b) the device comprises

barrier means (240) for separating said first reservoir from said second reservoir, which may be manipulated
to bring the first reservoir and the second reservoir into electrical conducting contact with one another; and

said barrier means (240) is adapted to include an upper release surface (242), a lower release surface (244)
and a pull tab (246) extending from the holding means so that the device may be activated by pulling the tab

(246) to remove the barrier (240) from the device to bring the first reservoir and the second reservoir into electrical
communication.
A user activated device as defined in claim 1 wherein said first reservoir indudes a second medication
to be delivered to the applied area of the patient, and said second reservoir is maintained in a dry state prior to

activation.
A user activated device as defined in either preceding claim, further comprising at least one barrier (38) situated
between the first reservoir and the second reservoir to limit the presence of competing ions when the two reservoirs

are in electrical conducting contact with one another.
A user activated device according to claim 1, which is an iontophoretic device wherein said second reservoir contains
a substantially non-hydrated vasoactive agent medication to be delivered to the applied area of the patient.
A user activated iontophoretic device as defined in claim 4, wherein the first reservoir includes a local anaesthetic and
the vasoactive agent is a vasoconstricting compound.
A user activated iontophoretic device as defined in claim 5, wherein the local anaesthetic is lidocaine and the vasoconstricting
compound is adrenaline.
A user activated device as defined in any preceding claim, wherein the electrolyte is an electrically conductive gel.
