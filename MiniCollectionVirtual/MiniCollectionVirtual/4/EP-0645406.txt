<ABSTRACT>
Amorphous copolymers of 65-99 mole % of perfluoro2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxole 
with complementary amounts of a) 

tetrafluorothylene and, optionally, at least one fluoro 
commonomer selected from monomers (b) to (i), have high 

glass transition temperatures of 140°C or higher, low 
indices of refraction, and good physical properties, and low 

dielectric constants, which make them suitable for cladding 
optical fibers as well as for many electronics applications, 

including the manufacture of substrates for circuit boards. 
They are all soluble at room temperature in perfluoro (2-butyltetrahydrofuran), 

which makes it practical to apply 
them as coatings from solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain amorphous
perfluoropolymers which are particularly suitable as
cladding materials in optical fiber constructions as
well as in certain electronics applications, molded
articles, and films.While tetrafluoroethylene homopolymers and
copolymers have many excellent properties, they
usually suffer from low modulus, especially at elevated
temperature; poor creep resistance; insolubility;
and in some cases intractability. Various fluoropolymers
have been proposed from time to time for cladding
optical fibers, mainly because of their low refractive
indices. A good polymeric cladding material for
optical fibers should be completely amorphous because
crystallites present in polymers would cause light
scattering. Further, it should have a high glass
transition temperature, Tg, especially if intended for
use at high temperatures because above its Tg it would
lose some of its desirable physical properties and in
particular it would be unable to maintain good bonding
to the fiber core. A desirable Tg would be above
140°C, preferably above 180°C, especially above 220°C.
Suitable, entirely amorphous fluoropolymers having
significantly high Tg's have not been heretofore
reported.U.S. Patent 3,978,030 to Resnick describes
certain polymers of perfluoro-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxole
(PDD), which has the following formula: 

The above patent describes both homopolymers of PDD,
which are not further characterized, and a crystalline
copolymer with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), which has a
melting point of about 265°C.Since Resnick's discovery of PDD homopolymer,
it has been established that the material is
amorphous and has a very high Tg of about 330°C. The
homopolymer, however, is not readily melt-processible
because of poor flow and some degradation.Crystalline copolymers of PDD with TFE
cannot be used in many applications, where, for
example, optical clarity, dimensional stability,
solubility, or high Tg is required.The polymers of U.S. Patent 3,978,030 have
thus not been produced commercially, in spite of the
fact that perfluoro polymers having desirable properties
would have many possible uses in various high
technology applications.US-A-4 530 569 discloses an optical fiber consisting of core clad with an amorphous copolymer of PDD with TFE selected from dipolymers and terpolymers containing in addition another ethylenically unsaturated monomer; the portion of PDD in the dipolymer being at least 11 mole % of the dipolymer; and the portion of PDD in the terpolymer being at least 12 mole % of the
