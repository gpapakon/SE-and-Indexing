<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a disengageable (disconnectable) freewheel comprising an axle (10) and a ring (12), the ring being able to rotate only in one free predetermined direction with respect to the axle. According to the invention, the freewheel comprises a gear motor unit (18) for driving the axle (10) in rotation in the opposite direction to the predetermined direction, and this results in the fact that the ring (12) can rotate at most as quickly as the axle in the opposite direction to the predetermined direction.

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a motor (18) and a free
wheel (8) to form a disengageable free wheel (8)

including a first (10) and a second (12) part, that can
rotate only in a free direction one relative to the

other, the motor (18) being fixed to a third part (20),
and being operative when powered, to rotate the first

part (10) only in its free direction with respect to the
second part (12) and, when still, to maintain said first

part (10) blocked with respect to the third part (20).
The combination of claim 1, characterized
in that the second part is a ring (12) and the first part

is a central shaft (10) on which the ring is blockable in
rotation by a ramp (13) and roller (14) system.
The combination of claim 1, characterized
in that said first part (10) is rotated by a worm gear

(26, 28).
An articulation characterized in that it
includes two coaxial free wheels (15, 15') according to

claim 1, with opposite free directions, the second parts
(12) of each free wheel being integral with a first

element (22) of the articulation, and the motors (18,
18') being integral with a second element (24) of the

articulation forming said third part.
