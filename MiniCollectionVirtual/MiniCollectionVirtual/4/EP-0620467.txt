<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-performance wide-angle 
aspheric zoom lens used for a video camera or the like, having a zoom 
ratio of approx. 3, a half angle of view of approx. 40° at the wide-angle 
end, and aberration correction. High image quality and high performance as well as operability 
and maneuverability are being demanded from the latest video cameras. 
Because of this, 1/3 inch high-resolution imaging devices have become 
popular and 1/4 inch imaging devices are now being developed. Thus, 
these devices have contributed to the decrease in size and weight of 
video cameras. In addition, a compact lightweight high-performance wide-angle 
zoom lens with a large aperture ratio is strongly in demand. 
Moreover, a decrease in cost is also strongly desired. Therefore, it is 
necessary to develop a high-performance wide-angle zoom lens comprised 
of fewer lenses that is machinable and has superior mass production 
characteristics. For a high-magnification wide-angle zoom lens, however, the 
outside diameter of the lens closest to an object increases; moreover 
several lenses are required to achieve high aberration correction. The  
 
size, weight, and price of the zoom lenses increase and therefore zoom 
lenses cannot be used in consumer video cameras. For compact and lightweight zoom lenses with a zoom ratio of 2 
to 3 and comprising fewer lenses, a two-group zoom lens is frequently 
used which zooms an object by arranging a lens group with a negative 
refracting power at the object side and a lens group with a positive 
refracting power at the image side and changing the distance between 
both lens groups. For example, the two-group zoom lens disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 5155629 has a zoom ratio of approx. 3, a half angle of 
view of 27° to 9° , and an F number of 2.8 to 5.7, comprising 7 to 8 
lenses. The two-group zoom lens disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 
No. Hei 3-16004 has a zoom ratio of approx. 2, a half angle of view of 
approx. 38° to 17°, and an F number of 4 to 4.5, comprising 10 lenses. In U.S. Patent No. 5 054 897 a two group lens with a 
zoom ratio of 2 a half angle of view at the wide 
angle zoom position of 27° and a F-number at the 
wide angle zoom position of 2 is described having 7 components. However, the existing two-group zoom lenses having the above 
constitution cannot simultaneously have a zoom ratio of approx. 3, a 
half angle of view of approx. 38°, and an F number of 2 because the 
lens comprises a small number of lenses. The present invention is
