<ABSTRACT>
A light intensity control apparatus includes a 
beam generation unit for generating a beam for image 

recording, a detection unit for detecting a light 
intensity of the beam generated by the beam generation 

unit, and a control unit for controlling the light 
intensity of the beam generated by the beam generating 

unit on the basis of the detection output from the 
detection unit. The control unit causes the detection 

unit to execute a monitor operation of the light 
intensity of the b
eam during an image recording period 
by the beam, and changes, during a non-image recording 

period, a light intensity control value of the beam on 
the basis of the light intensity of the beam monitored 

during the image recording period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light intensity
control apparatus for controlling a light intensity of
a light-emitting element and, more particularly, to a
light intensity control apparatus suitably used for an
optical printer or the like.As laser light intensity control in a conventional
laser beam printer, an APC (Auto Power Control) scheme
is used, and is employed in most of the existing laser
beam printers.In the APC scheme, a laser beam is emitted and is
received by a light-receiving element. The light
intensity of the received laser beam is
photo-electrically converted into an electrical amount.
The electrical amount is compared with a predetermined
reference value. As a result of comparison, if a
decrease in laser light intensity is detected, control
is made so that a laser drive current is increased to
increase a light intensity; otherwise, if an increase in light intensity is defected, the laser drive
current is decreased to decrease a light intensity.
This control will be referred to-as Laser APC
hereinafter. In the recent laser beam printers, the Laser APC
is executed at the beginning of printing and at a paper
interval during a printing operation. The paper
interval means a non-image region offset from an image
forming region on a drum in a rotating direction of a
drum (sub-scan direction of the laser).In this scheme, more specifically, an APC-START
request is issued from a central processing unit of the
laser beam printer at the paper interval, so that the
Laser APC is executed once.When the APC-START request is issued, the laser
drive current is temporarily cleared to 0 mA, and is
then gradually increased stepwise. In this case, an
electrical amount from the light-receiving element is
compared with a predetermined value in each step. When
the electrical amount from the light-receiving element
coincides with the predetermined value, an increase in
laser drive current is stopped, a forcible emission of
the laser is canceled, and the value is held until the
next APC-START request is issued. Therefore, in this
scheme, the light intensity of the laser is increased
stepwise, and when a predetermined light intensity is
reached, the laser is deenergized. Therefore, the
laser is continuously turned on to scan several lines
to several tens of lines on a photosensitive drum. The
Laser APC by this scheme will be referred to as paper
interval continuous Laser APC hereinafter. In another Laser APC scheme, when raster scan of a
laser scans a region other than a photosensitive drum
surface, the Laser
