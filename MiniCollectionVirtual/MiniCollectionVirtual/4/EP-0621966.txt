<ABSTRACT>
Electronic device to simplify the utilization of a data processing system by replacing the controls, visible on the screen, of the data processing system and accessible from a mechanical keyboard and/or any other inputting and/or pointing member by means of an interactive couple comprised of a tactile keyboard and icons, without having to modify the neither host computer nor its software applications. The device according to the invention comprises an electronic card with microprocessor (1) having a screen connector (102) for connection to the data processing system, a screen connector (103) for the screen, a keyboard connector (100) for the data processing system, and a tactile keyboard connector (101).

<CLAIMS>
Electronic device designed to simplify the use of a data processing system by
generating windows which are superimposed on the current application, these

windows being designed for control by means of a touch-sensitive screen covering the
screen of the computer, characterized in that it comprises at least one central unit with

a microprocessor associated with its RAM and ROM memories (4), a RAM memory
for the window position, a RAM memory (2) for data to be displayed in the windows,

a keypad interface (5) designed to be connected to the connector (100) of the
computer keyboard, and a peripheral circuit (6) for controlling the touch-sensitive

keypad (101), and in that an electronic switching system (1) enables it to be interposed
between the screen connector (102) of the computer and the screen (103) itself in such

a way that it is possible to select in real time the source of the data to be displayed,
namely the keyboard (100) or the touch-sensitive keypad (101).
Electronic device according to Claim 1, characterized in that it is fitted into a
casing which is interposed between the screen output of a computer and the screen

itself.
Electronic device according to Claim 1, characterized in that it is presented in
the form of an electronic card inserted directly into the computer.
Electronic device according to Claim 1, characterized in that it is presented in
the form of an independent module in a computer.
Electronic device according to any of Claims I to 4, characterized in that it
comprises a touch-sensitive keypad control unit (6) and a keyboard interface (5) for

connection to the host computer, and in that the central unit (4) converts the data from
pressure on the touch-sensitive keypad into standard keyboard data for entry into the

computer. 
Electronic device according to any of Claims I to 5, characterized in that the
microprocessor part (4) is capable of generating pre-programmed consecutive

keystroke sequences for entry into the computer.
Electronic device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that with the
touch-sensitive keypad covering the computer screen the central unit part (4) is

capable of linking the display windows of the device, the pressure on the touch-sensitive
keypad and the corresponding keystrokes generated for entry into the

computer.
