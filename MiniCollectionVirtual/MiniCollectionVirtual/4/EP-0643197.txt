<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
breaking an aqueous fracturing fluid comprising introducing 

said aqueous fracturing fluid into contact with an 
encapsulated breaker said encapsulated breaker comprising an 

aqueous fluid soluble breaker for said fracturing fluid 
encapsulated within a membrane comprising a partially 

hydrolyzed acrylic crosslinked with either an aziridine 
prepolymer or a carbodiimide, said membrane having 

imperfections through which an aqueous fluid can diffuse, 
such that an aqueous fluid in said fracturing fluid can 

diffuse through said membrane, dissolve at least a portion 
of said breaker and diffuse outward from said encapsulated 

breaker to contact and break the fracturing fluid in contact 
therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions and methods 
for treating subterranean formations. Specifically, the 
invention is directed to compositions used to break fracturing 
fluids utilized in the stimulation of subterranean formations. It is common practice to treat subterranean formations to 
increase the gross permeability or conductivity of such 
formations by procedures which are identified generally as 
fracturing processes. For example, it is a conventional 
practice to hydraulically fracture a well in order to produce 
one or more cracks or "fractures" in the surrounding formation 
by mechanical breakdown of the formation. Fracturing may be 
carried out in wells which are completed in subterranean 
formations for virtually any purpose. The usual candidates 
for fracturing, or other stimulation procedures, are 
production wells completed in oil and/or gas containing 
formations. However, injection wells used in secondary or 
tertiary recovery operations, for example, for the injection 
of water or gas, may also be fractured in order to facilitate 
the injection of fluids into such subterranean formations. Hydraulic fracturing is accomplished by injecting a 
hydraulic fracturing fluid into the well and applying 
sufficient pressure on the fracturing fluid to cause the 
formation to break down with the attendant production of one  
 
or more fractures. The fracture or fractures may be 
horizontal or vertical, with the latter usually predominating, 
and with the tendency toward vertical fracture orientation 
increasing with the depth of the formation being fractured. 
Usually a gel, an emulsion or a foam, having a proppant such 
as sand or other particulate material suspended therein is 
introduced into the fracture. The proppant is deposited in 
the fracture and functions to hold the fracture open after the 
pressure is released and the fracturing fluid flows back into 
the well. The fracturing fluid has a sufficiently high 
viscosity to retain the proppant in suspension or at least to 
reduce the tendency of the proppant to settle out of the 
fracturing fluid as the fracturing fluid flows along the 
created fracture. Generally, a gelation agent and/or an 
emulsifier is used to gel or emulsify the fracturing fluid to 
provide the high viscosity needed to realize the maximum 
benefits from the fracturing process. After the high viscosity fracturing fluid has been pumped 
into the formation and fracturing of the formation occurred, 
it is desirable to remove the fluid from the-formation to 
allo

A method of breaking an aqueous fracturing fluid, the method 
comprising introducing the aqueous fracturing fluid into contact with an 

encapsulated breaker, the encapsulated breaker comprising an aqueous fluid 
soluble breaker for the fracturing fluid encapsulated within a membrane, the
