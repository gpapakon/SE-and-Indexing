<ABSTRACT>
A two-step method for cloning restriction modification 
systems is provided which comprises introducing the modification 

or methylase gene into a host cell and expressing the gene 
therein to protect the host cell followed by introducing the 

restriction or endonuclease gene into the host whereby the 
restriction gene is expressed at lower levels relative to the 

modification gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a Divisional of European 
Application number 87305005.8 (EP-A-0 248 678). The present invention relates to a method for 
cloning restriction-modification systems, to the clones 
produced thereby, and to methods for producing 
restriction and/or modification enzymes from the 
clones. This invention also relates to clones for the 
DdeI and BamHI restriction endonucleases and 
modification methylases, and related methods for the 
production of these clones and enzymes. Restriction endonucleases are a class of enzymes 
that occur naturally in bacteria. When they are 
purified away from other contaminating bacterial 
components, restriction endonucleases can be used in 
the laboratory to break DNA molecules into precise 
fragments. This property enables DNA molecules to be 
uniquely identified and to be fractionated into their 
constituent genes. Restriction endonucleases have 
proved to be indispensable tools in modern genetic 
research. They are the biochemical 'scissors' by means 
of which genetic engineering and analysis is performed. Restriction endonucleases act by recognizing and 
binding to particular sequences of nucleotides (the 
'recognition sequence') along the DNA molecule. Once 
bound, they cleave the molecule within, or to one side 
of, the sequence. Different restriction endonucleases 
have affinity for different recognition sequences. 
Close to one hundred different restriction  
 
endonucleases have been identified among the many 
hundreds of bacterial species that have been examined 
to date. Bacteria tend to possess at most only a small 
number restriction endonucleases per species. The 
endonucleases typically are named according to the 
bacteria from which they are derived. Thus, the 
species Haemophilus aegyptius, for example synthesizes 
3 different restriction endonucleases, named Hae I, Hae 
II and Hae III. Those enzymes recognize and cleave the 
sequences (AT)GGCC(AT),PuGCGCPy and GGCC respectively. 
Escherichia coli RY13, on the other hand, synthesizes 
only one enzyme, EcoR I, which recognizes the sequence 
GAATTC. In nature, restriction endonucleases play a 
protective role in the welfare of the bacterial cell. 
They enable bacteria to resist infection by foreign DNA 
molecules like viruses and plasmids that would 
otherwise destroy or parasitize them. They impart 
resistance by scanning the lengths of the infecting DNA 
molecule and cleaving them each time that the 
recognition sequence occurs. The break-up that takes 
place disables many of the infecting

A method of cloning a non-plasmid-borne restriction-modification 
system which comprises: 


(a) introducing a modification gene corresponding to the 
restriction-modification system to be cloned into a cloning vector and 

expressing said gene in an appropriate host cell, wherein said expression 
of the modification gene is at levels sufficiently high to protect the host cell 

DNA from degradation by the restriction-modification system's restriction 
endonuclease; and 
(b) subsequently locating and introducing from the chromosomal 
DNA a restriction gene corresponding to the restricti
on-modification system

fragments; 
(c) ligating the fragment into the cloning vector; 
(d) transforming the host cell with the cloning vector of step (c) to 
form a library;
