<ABSTRACT>
Curing agent for aqueous epoxy resin dispersions, obtained by reacting an adduct (A) of at least one polyepoxide (A1) and at least one polyalkylene polyether polyol (A2), where the adduct (A) may have been modified by means of a secondary amine (A3), with     I. a product of the reaction of an amine (B) and an epoxide (C) or   II. an amine (B) followed by reaction with an epoxide (C), where the amount of amine (B) is selected so that the H atoms on the nitrogen are present in a 2- to 10-fold excess, based on the epoxide groups in (A).

<CLAIMS>
A curing agent for aqueous epoxy resin dispersions
obtained by reaction of an adduct (A) of at

least one polyepoxide (A
1
) and at least one
polyalkylene polyether polyol (A
2
), it being
possible for the adduct (A) to be modified

with a secondary amine (A
3
) if appropriate,
with a reaction product of an amine (B) and an

epoxide (C), the amount of amine (B) being
chosen such that the H atoms on the nitrogen

are present in a 2- to 10-fold excess, based
on the epoxide groups in (A), and the curing

agent containing primary amino groups.
A curing agent as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
epoxide compounds (C) employed are aliphatic and/or

cycloaliphatic mono- or diepoxides and/or aromatic
monoepoxides in an equivalent ratio of reactive

epoxide groups in (C) to N-H groups in (B) of (0.05
- 0.5) : 1.
A curing agent as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the epoxide compounds (C) employed are n-butyl

glycidyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether, cyclohexanedimethanol
diglycidyl ether and/or

polypropylene glycol diglycidyl ether (n = 2-12).
A curing agent as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 3, wherein component (A
1
) is a water-insoluble 
polyepoxide compound, preferably the diglycidyl

ether of bisphenol A, bisphenol F, cyclohexanedimethanol
and/or of a reaction product of bisphenol

A with propylene oxide, and component (A
2
) is a
water-soluble polyoxyalkylene glycol, preferably

polyethylene glycol.
A curing agent as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 4, wherein a (cyclo)aliphatic or araliphatic,

secondary amine is employed as the secondary amine
(A
3
) in an amount of up to 0.5 equivalent, preferably
0.02 to 0.25 equivalent, based on the epoxide

groups contained in the adduct of (A
1
) and (A
2
).
A curing agent as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 5, wherein the polyamine (B) is aliphatic,

cycloaliphatic, araliphatic and/or heterocyclic
amines, by themselves or as a mixture, and

preferably isophoronediamine, cyclohexanediamine,
TCD-diamine and meta-xylylenediamine.
A curing agent as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 6, wherein the curing agent is brought to a

solids content of 99 - 20% by weight with water.
The use of a curing agent as claimed in one or more
of claims 1 to 7, in combination with an aqueous

epoxy resin dispersion and/or water-dilutable
polyepoxide compound and water and if appropriate

customary paint additives and/or other curable
resins, for the preparation of paints, coverings,

primers, fillers, coatings, adhesives, troweling
compositions and the like and for modifying concretes

and mortars.
The use of a resin/hardener combination as claimed
in claim 8 for coating wood, plastics, mineral

substrates, composite materials, ceramics and pretreated
and unpretreated metals and as a binder for textile,

organic and/or inorganic materials.
