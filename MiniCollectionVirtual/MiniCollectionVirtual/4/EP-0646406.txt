<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas separators comprising membranes made from
a polyimide incorporating repeating units, derived from 9,9 disubstituted
xanthene dianhydrides and diamines and to a process for separating gases
making use of these membranes.US-A-Patents 5,101,004; US-A-5,051,520 and US-A-5,097,000 disclose certain 9,9-disubstituted
xanthene dianhydrides and methods for preparation. These
patents also disclose that the dianhydrides are useful for making polyimides
which have advantageous properties. The patents do not, however, disclose a
polyimide membrane based on such dianhydrides used in gas separation.US-A-Patent No. 5,051,520 discloses polyimide films derived from 9,9-Bis(trifluoromethyl)-xanthenetetracarboxylic
Dianhydride (V). Only 9,9-Bis(trifluoromethyl)-3.6-dihydroxy-xanthene
polyester (IX) is tested for gas
separation in the disclosure US-A-No. 5,051,520.European Patent Application EP-A-0 401 005 discloses amine-modified
polyimide membranes for O2/N2 gas separation. European Patent Application EP-A-0
437 611 and European Patent Application EP-A-0 446 947 disclose aromatic polyimide
membranes useful in O2/N2 gas separation.WO-A-91/15285 discloses films made of miscible blends of polyimide
polymers useful in O2/N2 gas separation.An article entitled "Polymeric Gas Separation Membranes," by R. E.
Kesting et al., pp. 144-152, 1993 describes the fundamental reactions leading
to the production of useful polyimide for gas separation membranes. The present invention relates to gas separators as defined in
claim 1, comprising specific polyimide gas separation
membranes, and the separation of at least one gas from a mixture of gases
using such membranes, according to claim 8. The polyimides are polymers or copolymers derived
from 9,9-disubstituted xanthene dianhydrides and diamines.
Preferably, at least about 10 mole percent and most preferalby at least about 50
mole percent of the dianhydride residues are derived from 9,9-disubstituted
xanthene dianhydride, which has the following structural formula:

where R and R' = -CH3, -CF3, -phenyl, substituted phenyl, alkyl or
perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 16 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms. R and
R' can be different or alike.These polyimides exhibit superior permselectivity with respect to
several gaseous mixtures and particularly with respect to mixtures of nitrogen
and oxygen, such as found in the atmosphere. The separation of one or more gases from a complex
multicomponent mixture of gases has been found to be necessary in a
large number
