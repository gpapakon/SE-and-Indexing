<ABSTRACT>
Polyvinyl chloride is prepared by 
suspension polymerization of a monomeric charge 

of vinyl chloride dispersed and suspended in an 
aqueous medium while agitating the suspension. 

An oil-soluble partially saponified polyvinyl 
alcohol is added to the monomeric charge as a 

dispersant at the start of polymerization. A 
water-soluble partially saponified polyvinyl 

alcohol and/or a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 
is continuously added as a suspending agent from 

the start of polymerization. The suspending 
agent is entirely added while the polymerization 

rate is in the range of 5-50%. The agitating 
power applied to the aqueous suspension is 50-110 

kg·m/s·ton while the suspending agent is 
being added, and increased above 110 kg·m/s·ton 

after the completion of addition. The resulting 
polymer has a high bulk density and a sharp 

particle size distribution and is susceptible to 
extrusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
preparing by suspension polymerization a vinyl
chloride polymer which has a particulate
structure with a high bulk density and a high
porosity, a sharp particle size distribution,
and improved processability and is thus suitable
for extrusion molding, injection molding and
blow molding.In the recent years, severer requirements
are imposed on the quality of vinyl chloride
polymers having a low degree of polymerization.
Those vinyl chloride polymers intended for use
in extrusion molding, injection molding and blow
molding are required to have a particulate
structure with a high bulk density and a high
porosity and a sharp particle size distribution,
and be easily processable.For the manufacture of vinyl chloride 
polymers, a suspension polymerization method is
well known in the art. This method is by
suspending and dispersing vinyl chloride monomer
in an aqueous medium for polymerization. In
particular, vinyl chloride polymers having a
high bulk density are manufactured by feeding
additional vinyl chloride monomer during
polymerization as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Kokai (JP-A) No. 168008/1984, or
using highly saponified polyvinyl alcohol as a
dispersant for suspending and dispersing vinyl
chloride monomer in an aqueous medium as
disclosed in JP-A 7600/1982.Also various attempts were made for
producing vinyl chloride polymers which are
easily processable and quickly gelled. For
example, JP-A 5866/1977, 15890/1977, 6392/1978,
and 112210/1980, and Japanese Patent Publication
(JP-B) No. 18562/1986 disclose the preparation
of vinyl chloride polymers using as a dispersant
an oil-soluble polyvinyl alcohol having a
degree of saponification of less than 55% and an
average degree of polymerization of less than
600. Finally, US-A- 5 096 988 describes a process for preparing
a vinyl chloride polymer, which comprises the following 3
steps of:
(1). suspending a monomer comprising vinyl chloride and an
oil-soluble polymerisation initiator in an aqueous medium
in the presence of a first dispersion stabilizer; this first
dispersion stabilizer comprises:
(A) a partially saponified polyvinyl alcohol with an
average polymerization degree of 1,500 to 2,700 and
a saponification degree of 75 to 85 mol %, and(B) a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose with a methoxy
substitution degree of 26 to 30% by weight, a hydroxypropoxy
substitution degree of 4 to 15% by weight
and a viscosity in a 2% by weight aqueous solution
at 20°C of 5 to 4,000 cP;(2). initiating suspension polymerization
