<ABSTRACT>
Device for monitoring the working lifetime (run-out time) of filter devices in air conditioning systems - having at least one filter and one air outlet for outlet of the conditioned air. In the intake region in front of the filter, at least one inlet nozzle for a test medium is provided which is connected to an input device. Between the inlet nozzle and the filter, at least one sensor for measuring the concentration of the test medium is arranged, at least one additional sensor for measuring the concentration of the test medium being connected downstream of the filter. A control and/or regulation appliance for automatically taking test measurements at defined time intervals of the order of hours or days is provided. The control and/or regulation appliance is connected to the input device for automatic input of test medium at the defined time intervals. The control and/or regulation appliance is designed for processing electrical signals from the sensors and is connected to at least one signal transmitter. The signal transmitter is arranged outside the air conditioning system.

The use of an apparatus for monitoring the life of filter devices, - having a fan (1) for
conveying the air to be purified, having at least one filter (2), and having an outlet channel

(3) with an air outlet (4) for allowing the conditioned air to flow out,

wherein at least one inlet nozzle (5) for a test medium is provided in the inflow region in front
of the filter (2), which inlet nozzle is connected to an input device (6) having a pump (7) and

tank (8) for the test medium,
wherein at least one sensor (9) for measuring the concentration of the test medium is

disposed between the inlet nozzle (5) and the filter (2), and wherein at least one further
sensor (10) for measuring the concentration of the test medium is disposed downstream of

the filter (2),
wherein at least one control- and/or regulating device (11) is installed for processing
electrical signals from the sensors (9, 10), characterised in that
the apparatus is inserted in a ventilation and air-conditioning installation, and the ventilation
air of an associated room to be ventilated is conveyed within the apparatus and the

conditioned ventilation air is allowed to flow from the air outlet (4) into the room to be
ventilated,
that automatic test measurements are made at defined time intervals of the order of
magnitude of several days with the aid of the control- and/or regulating device (11),
that a low-contaminant or contaminant-free test medium is introduced automatically, at the
defined time intervals, by the input device (6) connected to the control- and/or regulating

device (11), with the proviso that the amount of this low-contaminant or contaminant-free 
test medium which can be introduced each time is just sufficient for an operationally reliable

test measurement,
that the control- and/or regulating device (11) is connected to at least one signal transmitter
(12) at which an optical and/or acoustic signal is activated when the concentration values

measured in front of and behind the filter (2) approach each other, and that the signal
transmitter (12) is disposed outside the ventilation and air-conditioning installation in the

room to be ventilated and/or in at least one further room and/or in at least one central
monitoring location.
A use according to claim 1, characterised in that the test measurements are made at
time intervals of three to seven days.
A use according to either one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the apparatus
comprises operating elements for the manual activation of a test measurement.
A use according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the signal
transmitter (12) is disposed in the room to be ventilated, preferably in the region of the air

outlet (4).
A use according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the signal
transmitter (12) is constructed as a light-emitting diode (13, 15, 16, 17).
A use according to claim 5, characterised in that the light-emitting diode of the signal
transmitter (13) is a component of a control panel (14), on which at least one further light-emitting

diode (15, 16, 17) is disposed for displaying a satisfactory filter capacity and/or for
displaying the state of the tank level and/or for displaying a test measurement which is

proceeding.
