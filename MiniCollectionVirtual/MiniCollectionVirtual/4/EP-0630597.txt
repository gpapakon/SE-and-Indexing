<ABSTRACT>
Device for dispensing and applying a fluid product, comprising a bottle (2) containing the product, an applicator holder (30) equipped with an applicator (38), an impregnation channel (53) making it possible to impregnate the applicator (38) with the product, and a needle holder (12) equipped with a needle (13), the applicator holder (30) being movable in translation with respect to the needle holder (12) between a position in which the needle (13) closes off the impregnation channel (53) and a position in which the impregnation channel (53) is open, a manoeuvring device for the translation of the applicator holder (30) being provided, in which the manoeuvring device (40) consists of a sleeve actuated manually in rotation with respect to the bottle (2), in which sleeve the applicator holder (30) is displaced longitudinally, this sleeve having a length such that, in the position of closing off the impregnation channel (53), the applicator (38) is contained entirely inside the manoeuvring sleeve (40), the applicator (38) being a brush consisting of a ring of bristles fixed in annular fashion around the impregnation channel (53).

Device for dispensing and applying a fluid 
product comprising a container (2), containing the said 

product, an applicator holder (30) equipped with an 
applicator (38) and an impregnation channel (53) making 

it possible to impregnate the applicator (38) with the 
said product, the applicator holder (30) being translationally 

mobile with respect to an operating sleeve (40) 
carried by the container (2) between a position in which 

the impregnation channel (53) is closed off and a position 
in which the said channel is open, it being possible 

for the said operating sleeve (40) to be actuated manually 
in rotation with respect to the container (2) and 

having a length such that, in the position for closing 
off the impregnation channel, the applicator (38) is 

entirely contained within the said operating sleeve (40), 
the said operating sleeve (40) carrying an internal 

thread (44) interacting with an external thread (37) of 
the applicator holder (30), the said applicator holder 

(30) being rotationally blocked with respect to the 
operating sleeve (40), characterized in that, on the one 

hand, the obturator of the impregnation channel (53) is 
produced by means of a needle (13) integral with a needle 

holder (12) fixed to the container (2), and in that, on 
the other hand, the applicator (38) is a brush formed by 

a ring of bristles fixed annularly around the impregnation 
channel (53) and in that, finally, the applicator 

holder (30) includes a sealing bead (36) interacting with 
the internal wall of the operating sleeve (40) and continuously 

separating the brush from that region of the 
said operating sleeve (40) which carries the internal 

thread (44). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the operating sleeve (40) consists of four successive 

elements: 

the first (41) holding the sleeve (40) on the 
container (2) so that it can rotate with respect to the 

container (2); 
the second (43) carrying on its internal face  
 

a thread (44) intended to interact with a thread (37) of 
the applicator holder (30); 
the third (45) being a frustoconical element; 
and the fourth (46) being a cylindrical 
element, the internal surface of which interacts with the 

sealing bead (36). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the external thread (37) of the 

applicator holder (30) possesses only one to two turns. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the applicator holder (30) is 

rotationally blocked by a fin (35) integral with the said 
applicator holder (30) and arranged in a slot (23) made 

in the needle holder (12) which supports the needle. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that it possesses a cap (48) capable of 

covering the end of the operating sleeve (40) when the 
applicator (38) is in the position for closing off the 

impregnation channel (53). 
Assembly according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the cap (48) carries a sealing skirt (52) capable of 

bearing on the end of the operating sleeve (40).
