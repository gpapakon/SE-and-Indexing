<ABSTRACT>
The device includes a first and a second optical circulator (C1, C2) having an input port and an output 
port that are the inputs and the outputs of the switch, as well as an optical bandpass filter (FP) placed 

between the two circulators (C1,C2) and connected with means for switching its state so that the filter 
either reflects or transmits a given wavelength, thus allowing a carrier with this wavelength at the input 

port of one of the circulators (C1, C2) to reach the output port of the same circulator or the output port 
of the other circulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical switching devices and more particularly it concerns a two-by-two, 
wavelength selective optical switch. Wavelength selective optical switches can be used for example in routing nodes of a wavelength 
division multiplex network, i. e., a network in which information associated to various communications 
or groups of communications modulates separate carriers spaced apart by tens of nanometres to tenths 
of nanometre, depending on the requirements and the technologies used. For such applications, 
wavelength selectivity is necessary, so that the various carriers can be routed along different paths. 
Independence from polarisation is also desirable, so that polarisation state control systems need not be 
introduced and attenuation will not vary with the polarisation state. On the other hand, the switching 
speed need not be very high, response times of the order of some milliseconds being sufficient. A polarisation independent switching element particularly suited for low switching speed applications 
is described by A. C. Boucouvalas and G. Georgiou in the paper "Fibre-optic interferometric tunable 
switch using the thermo-optic effect", Electronics Letters, Vol. 21, No. 11, May 23, 1985. The switch 
consists in an optical fibre Mach- Zehnder interferometre, in which the optical length of one of the two 
branches can be varied through a heating electrode applied to a thin film connected to the fibre in the 
branch. By applying adequate voltages to the electrode, the power associated to an optical input signal 
is split as desired between the two outputs. Thermo-optical switches based on the same principle can be used to form switching matrices with  
 
several inputs and outputs, as described in the paper "Silica-based optical- matrix switch with 
intersecting Mach-Zehnder waveguides for larger fabrication tolerances" by M. Kawachi et alii, 
Conference OFC/IOOC '93, 21-26 February 1993, San Jos√©, California, (U.S.A.), paper TuH4. The behaviour of thermo-optical switches, however, is substantially independent from 
wavelength. Therefore, they must be coupled to optical bandpass filters for wavelength 
selective routing. A wavelength-division-multiplexing add-drop multiplexer employing an acousto-optical 
tunable filter between two optical circulators providing first and second inputs/outputs is 
described in Electronics Letters, Vol. 29, No. 10, 12-5-93, pages 905 to 907, in an article by M. 
Fukutoku et al. The filter being an acousto-optical polarization

a first three-port optical circulator (C1) with an input port (P1) and an 
output port (P2) respectively being a first input and a first output of the 

switch; 
a second three-port optical circulator (C2) with an input port (P'1) and an

viceversa. so that a carrier at that wavelength arriving at the input port of one of 

the circulators (C1, C2) is transferred to the output port of the same circulator in a 
straight state or to the output port of the other circulator in a crossed state.

state of the filter (FP) are capable of setting it to the crossed state for a given 

selectable wavelength in a wavelength-division multiplex present at the inputs, and
