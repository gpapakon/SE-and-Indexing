<ABSTRACT>
A pattern making and pattern drafting system is 
disclosed. 
The system has a pattern group, stored in memory, 
consisting of a plurality of patterns having prescribed 

base lines and base points. Commands are executed to 
perform prescribed processing on a reference pattern and 

are stored into memory, the thus stored commands then 
being reproduced sequentially on at least one object 

pattern other than the reference pattern. In 
reproducing a command, the target point to be processed 

and the amount of processing to be performed by the 
command are recognized by reference to existing line 

consisting of base lines and other lines drawn on the 
reference pattern and existing points consisting of base 

points, both end points of each existing line, and other 

points drawn on the reference pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pattern making 
and pattern drafting system used in the field of garment 
making, etc., and more particularly to a pattern making and 
pattern drafting system wherein a pattern making and 
pattern drafting process performed on a particular pattern 
according to a prescribed design is prestored in memory and 
the prestored contents are adapted to the making of other 
patterns, thus enabling patterns to be made using base 
patterns created for various body types and sizes without 
impairing the impression of the original design. In garment making, first a pattern is cut to 
actually form a garment from the design created by the 
designer. Usually, such patterns are made by hand or by 
using an apparel CAD; the pattern making and the pattern 
drafting process is called pattern making and pattern 
drafting. (In this specification, the term "pattern" is 
used to refer to a broad concept, including patterns 
displayed on the screen of a CAD machine from which paper 
patterns are cut.) Whether the finished garment is comfortable to wear 
and whether the image intended by the designer is reflected 
properly in the garment depend on how accurately the 
pattern is made. The quality of the pattern in turn 
depends on the skill of individuals, whether an apparel CAD 
is used or not, and under the current circumstances, it 
largely depends on the workmanship of skilled 
patternmakers. On the other hand, with the recent trend toward 
diversification and individuality of dress fashion design, 
apparel makers are urged to supply garments in a variety of 
designs and for different types of body shapes and sizes. 
Under these circumstances, apparel makers are being pressed  
 
with increasing amount of pattern making and pattern 
drafting work, and hence, the need to further reduce the 
time required for pattern making and pattern drafting. It 
is therefore imperative to reduce the dependence of pattern 
making and pattern drafting on skilled workers only. Various approaches have been made to solve such a 
problem, and one such approach, which aims at reducing the 
time and labor required for pattern making and pattern 
drafting by improving apparel CAD, is disclosed in Japanese 
Laid-open Patent Publication No. 54-161446. In the apparel 
CAD described in this Publication, processing instructions 
for pattern making and pattern drafting are supplied, using 
an instruction sheet, to a system in which a plurality of 
base patterns and pattern making and pattern drafting 
theories are
