<ABSTRACT>
A convolution of input data S0 and a Gabor function G(alpha),(omega) is implemented by a processing unit (20) to obtain a wavelet coefficient Tg(20,b) of a 0th stage. The input data S0 is applied to a low-pass filter (30) and is subjected to Gaussian-type filtering so as to be converted into input data S1 for a 1st stage. The frequency of the high-frequency components of this input data is halved by this filtering. A convolution of this input data S1 and a Gabor function G(alpha)/3,2(omega)/3 is implemented by a processing unit (21) to obtain a wavelet coefficient Tg(21,b) of the 1st stage. In the convolution of the 1st stage, the sampling interval is twice that of the 0th stage. Thenceforth, and in similar fashion, the sampling interval in processing operations of subsequent stages is doubled from one stage to the next. As a result, there is no increase in the amount of processing in each stage and a coefficient Tg(2j,b) can be obtained with identical precision in each stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high speed processing apparatus and method 
and the use of the apparatus in 
a signal analyzing system, and 
a measuring system, and the use of the method in a measuring method. More particularly, 
the invention relates to an apparatus and method that 
utilize a wavelet transform. The application of the wavelet transform to speech 
recognition, image processing, turbulence theory, nonlinear, 
non-equilibrium physics, chaos and fractals has 
become extensive in recent years. Wavelet analysis is signal processing that is used 
when it is desired to know not only the frequency 
contained in data but also time or position information. 
Wavelet analysis involves selecting, as a base function, 
a function localized about a certain time (space) and 
not a function spread uniformly in time (space), as in 
the manner of a trigonometric function used in Fourier 
analysis, and performing analysis of a signal by a 
parallel translation and similar transformation. By 
virtue of such analysis, it becomes possible to specify 
not only frequency but also the position of an event. Further, since the signal is decomposed by a 
similar transformation, which is dilation and  
 
contraction of the base, the nature of wavelet analysis 
is such that time-wise resolution rises with respect to 
sudden changes (high frequencies) while frequency 
resolution rises with respect to gradual changes (low 
frequencies). A wavelet transform Tg(a,b) of an input signal S(t) 
in which G(t) represents the base function is defined as 
follows: 
 
where * denotes the complex conjugate and Tg(a,b) is 
referred to as a wavelet coefficient. Further, a 
represents a scale parameter [the range of dilation of 
the base function G(t)] and b represents shift (the 
position of the base function in space or time). 
Equation (1) is the convolution of the base function 
G(t) and input signal S(t). By taking the discrete versions of the base 
function and input signal and representing these by 
G[(n-b)/a] and S(n) (n = 1, 2, ...), respectively, we 
may express Equation (1) as follows: 
Figs. 24a and 24b illustrate the distinction between a  
 
wavelet transform and a Fourier transform. Fig. 24a shows the wavelet transform. Here the 
input signal S(t) is decomposed into signals Gα0,ω0(t), 
Gα1,ω1(t) localized about a certain time (space). Here 
2ω0 = ω1 holds. The function Gα,ω (t) shown in Fig. 24a 
is the Gabor function, which is used generally as the 
base function, and is expressed by the following 
equation: 
G(t) =Gα, ω
