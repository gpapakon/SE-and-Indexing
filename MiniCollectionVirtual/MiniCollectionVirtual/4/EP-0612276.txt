<ABSTRACT>
The method and apparatus for reclaiming substantially pure sand from a heat treating furnace (19); wherein a casting with sand core and/or sand mold, comprising sand bound by a combustible binder, attached thereto is introduced into the heat treating furnace (19); or, wherein portions of sand core and/or sand mold that are not attached to a casting are introduced into the heat treating furnace (19). Wherein, the reclaiming within the furnace (19) is carried out, in part, by a fluidizer (40) that promotes binder combustion by one or more processes of agitating, heating, and oxygenating. Wherein the characteristics of the reclaimed sand (25) are selectively controlled by controlling the dwell time of the sand (25) within the heat treating furnace (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field
of heat treating metal castings and the field of reclaiming
sand from sand cores and sand molds used to make
metal castings.Generally, prior art methods and apparatus require
that two or three distinctly separate steps be taken in
order to heat treat a metal casting formed by a permanent
mold or sand mold with a sand core, and reclaim
sufficiently pure sand from the sand mold or sand core
(see e.g. US 4,478,572, upon which the preambles of
claims 1 and 10 are based; US 4,620,586; US
4,700,766). The present invention allows for heat treating
and reclamation of sufficiently pure sand in a single
step.Methods and apparatus for manufacturing metal
castings are well known. Molds and cores are used to
displace molten material so that when the molten material
is solidified, a casting is formed that reflects the features
of the mold and core. Molds have the exterior
features of the casting formed on the interior walls of the
mold and cores have the interior features of the casting
formed on the exterior surface of the core. The cores
are typically made from sand whereas the molds are
sometimes made from sand. Sand molds and cores are
typically pre-molded from a mixture of sand and a combustible
binder. For simplicity, sand molds and sand
cores are referred to hereafter as simply sand cores.In accordance with some of the prior art, once the
casting is formed, three distinctly different steps are carried
out in order to heat treat the metal casting and
reclaim sufficiently pure sand from the sand core. The
first step separates portions of sand core from the casting.
The sand core is typically separated from the casting
by one or a combination of means. For example,
sand may be chiseled away from the casting or the casting
may be physically shaken to break-up the sand core
and remove the sand. Once the sand is removed from
the casting, the second and third steps are carried out.
In this typical, three-step prior art, the order in which the
second and third steps are taken is not important, since
the sand has already been separated from the casting.
The second step consists of heat treating the casting.
The casting is typically heat treated if it is desirable to
strengthen or harden the casting. The third step consists
of purifying the sand that was separated from the
casting. The purification processes is typically carried
out by one or a combination of means. These may
include burning the binder that coats the sand, abrading
the sand, and passing portions of
