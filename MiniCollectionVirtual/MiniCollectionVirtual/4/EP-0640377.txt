<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method for the removal of 
pollutants from a combustion gas and a plant for carrying out the method, 
wherein, in a post-combustion type plant, SO2 and NOX 
are removed with the gas energizing technique. According to the state of the art, with the above mentioned methods and plants 
the removal of SO2 generally takes place through thermo-chemical reactions, 
even when there is no energy transferred to the gas, and through radical reactions, 
when energy is transferred to the gas. The radicals produced by the 
transferral of energy to the gas similarly provide for the removal of nitrogen oxides. Firstly, the interaction between the gas and electrons of suitable energy is 
caused, so as to transform the SO2 and NOX, respectively into H2SO4 and 
HNO3 and, hence, an input of NH3, so as to convert these acids into ammonia 
salts and, lastly, a collection of said salts in electrostatic precipitators and/or 
in sleeve filters. Within the state of the art we refer especially to a method and plant, as described 
by the applicant in EP-A-0 532 841, in which 
the removal of pollutants takes place conventionally by means of: cooling of 
the combustion gas; passage of the gas in at least a first electrostatic precipitator, 
to gather most of the light ashes; gas energizing, to partly convert SO2 into 
H2SO4 and NOX into N2, NO2, and HNO3; and addition of ammonia, to 
convert the latter acids into ammonia salts, to be gathered in at least a further 
electrostatic precipitator. The main characteristics of this process are the 
maintenance of the temperature at around 100°C, so as to reduce the thermo-chemical 
conversion of the SO2 into acidic sulphides and sulphates and, subsequently, the 
injection of H2O2 into the gas, to convert the residual SO2 into H2SO4 which  
 
reacts with NH3 to produce ammonia salts. The inconvenience of this state of the art is that it provides a limited removal of 
NOX, because of the strong concentration of NO2 deriving from the radical 
conversion of NO. This inconvenience is, formally, avoided by accepting an 
NH3 content of various dozens of ppmv in the output gas from the plant and, 
concretely, by inserting a sleeve filter into the plant; however, this causes blockage 
of the filter and leads to high operating costs and to interruptions in the running 
of the plant for maintenance activities. It is also worth mentioning that DE-A-3 907 703 discloses a method and an apparatus, 
pertaining the same field of the present invention, wherein the energizing
