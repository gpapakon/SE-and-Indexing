<ABSTRACT>
An automatic focus and indirect illumination control system for focusing a camera imaging lens on a scene and for selectively illuminating the scene with light from a camera associated light source wherein the camera includes active (40, 41) and passive scene range finders for automatic focus control of the imaging lens, an active bounce surface range finder and direct and indirect illumination lamps operable in relation to the detection of a reflective surface. The active range finders (40, 41) are connected to a common drive circuit and auto ranging circuit and are operated selectively by the camera microcontroller in conjunction with a scene illumination photometric sensor. A passive multi-spot scene range finder (43) is operated in conjunction with the active single-spot scene range finder for automatic focus control based on left, central and right subject distance information under normal scene illumination conditions and central subject distance information under low scene illumination, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
AUTOMATIC FOCUS AND INDIRECT ILLUMINATION CAMERA SYSTEMField of InventionThe present invention relates to automatic exposure (AE) , automatic focus (AF) , and automatic illumination apparatus for cameras and, more particularly, to active and passive range finding systems for providing distance related control signals for AE control and for detecting indirect reflecting surfaces for illumination of the scene captured by still cameras, video cameras and the like.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSophisticated, microprocessor based control systems for video cameras, still cameras and cine cameras have been developed together with advances in synchronized direct and indirect scene illumination systems for providing automatic exposure, automatic focus and, in the case of still cameras, automatic strobe flash illumination, mounted on or associated with the camera. The microprocessor based control systems for such cameras store operating algorithms for processing user interface and sensor developed signals and for developing imaging lens focus, image exposure, media (film or videotape) advance and illumination control signals as well as providing data and signals to the user. Such a highly developed automatic camera control system is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,049,916 to O'Such et al, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.The illumination of objects in a scene that is insufficiently lighted by natural or artificial indoor lighted is typically effected by a camera mounted or associated flood lamp, in the case of video or cine cameras, and the electronic strobe flash systems, in the case of still cameras. Electronic 

 strobe flash systems mounted on or in a camera and involving the rapid discharge of a high voltage through a flash lamp synchronized with the exposure of an image frame are well-known in the photographic art. For indoor illumination of a scene, it is desirable to provide indirect lighting so that it appears to be illuminated from above in a way characteristic of natural lighting and to illuminate the scene directly to soften dark shadows caused by downwardly directed light.In strobe flash illumination for still cameras, the indirect illumination is commonly known as "bounce" flash, since the light is typically directed upward and bounced off a reflective ceiling and onto the scene, although it is also known to bounce the flash light off a vertical wall or panel to provide side illumination. Flash light aimed directly at the scene is referred to as direct illumination or
