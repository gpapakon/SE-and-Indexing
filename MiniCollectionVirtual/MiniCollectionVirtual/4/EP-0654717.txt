<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a timepiece having a body or support on which may be held, in a removable manner, a detachable piece. The invention also relates to a method for fastening this piece to this body or support. The timepiece is characterised in that the means for fixing the detachable piece to the body or support consist of at least one revolving lock (10) which is anchored permanently into the actual material of the body or support (2) with axial immobilisation provided by this material.

Timepiece of the type including a body or frame 
(2) on which is held, in a detachable manner, an added 

element (6), such as for example a protective plate, this 
element being held on the body or frame (2) by fixation 

means attached to the body or frame able to rotate while 
remaining at a constant height in relation to the body or 

frame to enable said added element (6) to be unlocked and 
released, characterized in that the fixation means are 

formed by at least one bolt (10) which is anchored in the 
material itself of the body or frame, and is axially 

immobilised in relation to the latter. 
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the bolt (10) comprises a body (12) provided with at 

least one shoulder (20a, 20b, 20c) which is held axially 
by a deformed part of the material forming said frame (2). 
Timepiece according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the body (12) of the bolt (10) comprises along its 

length at least one flange (22) which comprises said 
shoulder (20b, 20c) and which is permanently anchored in 

the material forming said frame (2), this flange (22) 
improving the holding of the bolt (10) in the frame. 
Timepiece according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said flange (22) is chamfered on a first side 

oriented towards a foot (14) of said bolt (10) while it 
has a straight shoulder (20c) on a second side, opposite 

to the first one. 
Timepiece according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said flange (22) is arranged at a distance in 

relation to a foot (14) of said bolt (10). 
Timepiece according to claim 5, characterized in 
that said flange (22) has an external diameter (D2) 

greater than that (D1) of the foot (14). 
Timepiece according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said shoulder (20a) is formed by a face of a radial 

groove (26) arranged in the body (12) of the bolt (10).  
 
Timepiece according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said bolt (10) has a head 

(16) with at least one wing (28) able to be moved in an 
angular direction and formed to cover in a position called 

the locking position, a supporting area (30) arranged on 
the added element (6) in order to ensure its holding on 

the body or frame (2). 
Timepiece according to claim 8, characterized in 
that said supporting area (30) is arranged by the 

distortion of a rim of an access orifice (32) formed in 
the added element (6). 
Timepiece according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bolt (10) comprises at 

least one lateral flat part (32a, 32b) extending in a 
longitudinal direction in relation to the latter and 

comprising in the material of the body or frame (2) a 
corresponding flat shape to increase the rotational torque 

of the bolt (10) in said body or frame (2). 
Method of assembling an element added to a body 
or frame of a timepiece, characterized in that it consists 

of: 

arranging an initial hole in said body or frame 
(2), 
providing at least one fixing bolt (10) intended 
to hold an added element (6) onto the body or frame (2), 

this bolt (10) having at least one shoulder (20a, 20b, 
20c) and at least one locking wing (28), and 
introducing said bolt (10) into the initial hole 
(24) of the frame (2) while deforming the material forming 

said body or frame (2) to lead it to cover said shoulder 
(20a, 20b, 20c), in order to hold said bolt (10) in place 

by means of the material itself of the body or frame (2), 
this bolt in this position being suited to hold said added 

element. 
Assembling method according to claim 11, characterized 
in that said bolt (10) is introduced into the body 

or frame (2) by orienting said locking wing (28) into an  
 

angular position such that it comes to rest upon added 
element (6) which has been previously positioned on the 

body or frame in order to be locked. 
Assembling method according to claim 11, characterized 
in that the material of the body or frame (2) is 

deformed by heating the material, the heat being provided 
by the bolt (10) as it is installed. 
Assembling method according to claim 13, characterized 
in that the heating of the material is caused by 

applying high frequency vibrations to the bolt (10). 
Assembling method according to claim 14, characterized 
in that the high frequencies are selected in the 

ultrasonic range.
