<ABSTRACT>
Imidazolyl-substituted phenylacetic acid prolinamides are prepared by reacting appropriate imidzolyl-substituted phenylacetic acids with prolines. The imidazolyl-substituted phenylacetic acid prolinamides can be used as active ingredients in medicaments, preferably for the treatment of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
