<ABSTRACT>
The mixer and disperser head (1) comprises a cylindrical, 
tubular mixing chamber (3) having a plurality of equally 

angularly spaced discharge slots (7) through its periperal 
wall, a first plurality of impeller blades (11) rigidly 

connected to one axial end of the mixing chamber (3), a 
second plurality of impeller blades (27) rigidly connected 

to the other axial end of the other end of the mixing chamber 
(3), and a shaft (15) rigidly connected to the first plurality 

of impeller blades (11) coaxially with and situated 
quite outside the mixing chamber. The first (11) and second 

(27) pluralities of impeller blades being mirror-images of 
each other relatively off-set by an angle of 60° about the 

rotational axis (5) of the mixer and disperser head (1). 
The first plurality of impeller blades (11) consists of 

three identical blades (17) angularly off-set by 120° for 
each other. Each blade (17) comprising a portion (19) which 

is leading in the rotational direction (R) of the mixer and 
dispenser head (1) and a trailing portion (21) forming an 

inward obtuse angle with the leading portion (19). The leading 
portion (19) has a first part (23) lying in a plane 

perpendicular to the axis (5) of rotation and spaced from 
the one end of the mixing chamber (3) and a second part 

(24) bent inward about 90° from the first part (23) and 
rigidly connected such as by welding (9) to the rim of said 

one end of the mixing chamber (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary mixer and disperser 
head for operations such as dispersing, dissolving, emulsifying 
and blending of solids, liquids or gases with other 
liquids. The mixer and disperser head according to the invention is 
particularly useful in the food-processing industry, the 
chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry and other 
branches of industry for dispersing and dissolving of solids 
and semi-solids in liquids. A mixer head for such purposes is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of 
US-A-3,170,638. This mixer head has a mixing chamber comprising 
two sections in the form of truncated cones; one 
at each end of a cylindrical middle section which is slotted 
along its periphery, and a central shaft extends through the 
mixer head. The conical sections act as centrifugal pumps 
pumping the substances to be mixed into the cylindrical 
section where in a first stage they undergo a hydraulic 
shear where the two streams meet. The slots in the middle 
section act in a second stage as specific shear elements, 
while a third shear stage occurs when the radial discharge 
from the head meet the slower moving contents of the mixing 
vessel. The shear forces act to mix the substances and in 
particular to disperse and dissolve solids in the fluid 
mixture. Mixer heads of this type present several disadvantages. 
Thus, for a given diameter of the mixing chamber and a given 
rotational speed the throughput is delimited by the smaller 
cross sectional inlet areas of the conical sections. Further, 
in acting as centrifugal pumps the conical sections impart 
to the substances to be mixed a considerable tangential 
component of velocity which rather than to contribute to  
 
the hydraulic shear detracts therefrom. The central shaft 
extending through the mixing chamber reduces the volume 
thereof and thereby the retention time therein for the fluid 
mixture. Finally are such mixer heads not immediately accessible 
for ocular inspection after a cleaning-in-place procedure 
(CIP-procedure) due to the presence of the conical 
sections and the throughgoing shaft. A mixer and disperser head is furthermore shown in Figs. 1-3 
of US-A-4,900,159. In this mixer head a pair of impellers 
are clamped to each end of a generally cylindrical mixing 
chamber by means of a shoulder and a nut on a shaft extending 
through a bore in a central hub in the mixing chamber. The 
mixing chamber has a plurality of axially extending slots 
in its peripheral wall which is connected to the central 
hub by means of a
