<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screw type dewatering 
machine for compressing and dewatering sludge, sewerage, 
night soil and the like. A known dewatering machine of this type comprises inner 
and outer sleeves disposed coaxial with each other, and a 
coil-like screw disposed in an annular space chamber defined 
between said inner and outer sleeves, said screw being 
rotatably supported at one end thereof by said inner 
and/outer sleeves. And a material to be dewatered is charged into said 
annular space chamber through a charge port disposed in one 
end of the outer sleeve and is compressed for dewatering 
by the rotation of said coil-like screw. The dewatered 
material is discharged through a discharge port formed in 
the end of the annular space chamber corresponding to the 
other end of said outer sleeve. In this connection, according to the above arrangement, 
one end of the coil-like screw is only supported by the 
inner and/or outer sleeve, the other end not being 
supported by a special mechanism.  For this reason, the other end of the coil-like screw 
is elastically deformed under the reaction during 
compression, that is, the coil-like screw is contracted 
toward one end; therefore, there is a drawback that 
compression of material to be dewatered cannot be fully 
effected. In addition, increasing the thickness of the coil-like 
screw would be effective to prevent elastic deformation but 
this is disadvantageous in that it leads to an increase in 
weight and to a need for increasing the strength of the 
dewatering machine, resulting in a large-sized apparatus 
with an increase in cost. Accordingly, and object of the present invention is to 
provide a screw type dewatering machine adapted not to 
axially contract without having to increase the thickness 
of the coil-like screw. To achieve this object, the invention provides a screw 
type dewatering machine including inner and outer sleeves 
disposed coaxial with each other, an annular space chamber 
defined between said inner and outer sleeves, a charge port 
for material to be dewatered formed in one end of said 
outer sleeve, a discharge port for said material formed in 
one end of said annular space chamber, and a coil-like 
screw rotatably disposed in said annular space chamber to 
convey toward said discharging port the material to be  
 
dewatered charged into said annular space chamber through 
said charging port, the other end of said annular space 
chamber being adapted to serve as a dewatering zone to 
compresses said material to

outer sleeves disposed coaxial with each other, an annular 
space chamber defined between said inner and outer sleeves, 

a charge port for material to be dewatered formed in one 
end of said outer sleeve, a discharge port for said 

material formed in one end of said annular space chamber, 
and a coil-like screw rotatably disposed in said annular 

space chamber to convey toward said discharging port the 
material to be dewatered charged into said annular space 

chamber through said charging port, one end of said annular 
space chamber being adapted to serve as a dewatering zone 

to compresses said material to squeeze the water therefrom, 
the water being discharged to the outside through a 

discharge screen installed on the inner and/or outer 
sleeve, the other end of said annular space chamber being 

adapted to serve as a plug zone to compress material to be 
dewatered, said screw type d
ewatering machine being 
characterized in that it further includes;
