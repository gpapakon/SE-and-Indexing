<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a compact in-die tapping tool for 
threading holes in a sheet metal workpiece, of the kind known for example 
from US-A-2,314,138. A tool of this kind is 
particularly applicable to a progressive die method while 
advantageously eliminating the cost and inefficiency commonly 
associated with a secondary operation of having to move the 
workpiece to a drill press at a remote location at which the 
holes are threaded. As will be known to those skilled in the sheet metal 
industry, and particularly those familiar with progressive die 
methods, holes are initially punched in a sheet metal workpiece 
as one step of a progressive die method. It is then common to 
remove the workpiece to a (e.g. drill) press at a distant 
location so that the holes can be threaded as part of a secondary 
operation. The need for a secondary operation to thread the 
holes increases manufacturing time and handling requirements 
which correspondingly increases the cost of production. The tapping tool of this invention may be easily located in 
and removed from a die that is used in a progressive die method, 
whereby to thread holes in a workpiece and eliminate the wasteful 
secondary step of having to remove the workpiece for threading 
at a remote location. Tapping tools are commercially available in the sheet metal 
working art. However, such conventional tapping tools are  
 
generally characterized by large size, slow operation and high 
cost of manufacture. Consequently, such tools are not ideally 
suited for use in a progressive die method. One example of an 
efficient, relatively compact tapping tool that is adapted to be 
interfaced with a punch press is that described in U.S. Patent 
No. 5,016,335 issued May 21, 1991. An important distinction 
between the patented tapping tool and the tapping tool of the 
present invention is the fact that the patented tool requires 
that a threaded shaft assembly be axially advanced towards a 
workpiece to thread the holes formed therein. However, the axial 
position of a threaded shaft assembly of the instant tapping tool 
is fixed, and the tap is advanced relative to the shaft assembly 
towards the workpiece. Further attention is drawn to US patent 2,314,138 which 
discloses a thread tapping apparatus comprising a punch holder 
which may form a part of the ram of the punch press. The punch 
holder has a plate secured to its underside. Suitably fixed to 
the upper side of the plate 2 is an internally threaded multi-thread 
nut. The nut is adapted to receive a

<CLAIMS>
A tapping tool (1) for threading a hole (108) in a 
workpiece (106), comprising: 


a base (4) ; 
an end cap (8) to which an impact force is applied, said end 
cap (8) movable towards said base when an impact force is applied 

thereto; 
spring means (9, 10) located between said end cap and said 
base, said end cap (8) adapted to be moved towards said base (4) and 

against the normal bias of said spring means when an impact force 
is applied to said end cap (8); 
shaft means (26) having first (28) and opposite (30) ends, 
said first end (28) being threaded; 
a planetary roller nut (42) moving axially along the 
threaded end (28) of said shaft means (26) when said end cap (8) 

is moved towards said base (4) to cause said shaft means (26) to 
rotate; and 
tap carrying means (52) retaining a tap (56) and being 
coupled to said shaft means (26) at the opposite end (30) thereof 

so that the rotation of said shaft means is imparted to said tap 
carrying means, said tap carrying means (52) adapted to slide axially 

over said opposite end (30) of said shaft means (26) and towards 
the workpiece (106) in response to the rotation of said shaft 

means for correspondingly advancing the tap towards the hole 
(108) in the workpiece. 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 1, further 
comprising bearing means (36, 38) to support said shaft means 

(26) for rotation about the longitudinal axis of said shaft means  
 

such that the axial position of said shaft means relative to the 
workpiece (106) remains constant. 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 1, further 
comprising a roller nut housing (44) connected to said end cap 

(8) and movable therewith towards said base (4), said roller nut 
housing carrying said planetary roller nut (42) such that said 

roller nut moves axially along the threaded end (28) of said 
shaft means (26) when said end cap moves towards said base. 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 1, wherein said 
shaft means (26) has a polygon shaped opposite end (30) and said 

tap carrying means includes a sleeve (52) in which to receive 
said polygon shaped end of said shaft means, whereby to couple 

said tap carrying means to said shaft means so that a rotation 
of said shaft means is imparted to said tap carrying means (52). 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 4, further 
comprising a lead screw (70) having a cavity (78) formed therein 

in which to receive the sleeve (52) of said tap carrying means 
in order to couple said lead screw to said tap carrying means, 

such that the rotation of said tap carrying means is imparted to 
said lead screw. 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 5, further 
comprising a hollow cylindrical body (6) extending from said base 

(4) towards said end cap (8) and having threads formed at an 
interior wall (7) thereof, said lead screw (70) coupled to said 

cylindrical body such that the rotation imparted to said lead 
screw from said tap carrying means (52) causes said lead screw  

 
to rotate around and move axially along the threaded wall of said 

cylindrical body for correspondingly advancing said tap carrying 
means axially relative to the polygon end (30) of said shaft 

means (26) and towards the workpiece (106). 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 1, further 
comprising a tap collet (60) surrounding said tap carrying means 

(52) and applying a force to retain the tap (56) within said tap 
carrying means, said tap collet being slidable axially along said 

tap carrying means to release said tap therefrom. 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 1, wherein said 
spring means between said end cap (8) and base (4) are helical 

compression springs (9, 10). 
The tapping tool (1) recited in claim 8, further 
comprising a plurality of guide sleeves (12, 13) having first 

ends connected to said end cap (8) and opposite ends spaced above 
said base (4), and shoulder screws (15, 17) having first ends 

(22, 24) connected to said base and opposite ends (18, 20) 
received within and riding through respective ones of said guide 

sleeves (12, 13) when said end cap is moved towards said base, 
said guide sleeves being coaxially aligned with and extending 

axially through respective ones of said compression springs (9, 
10).
