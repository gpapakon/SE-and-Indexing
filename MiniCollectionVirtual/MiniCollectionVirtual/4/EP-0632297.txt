<ABSTRACT>
Multilevel surface relief phase grating structures (14, 16) of a binary diffractive optical 
element (10) are spacially offset from each other along the surface of the binary diffractive optical 

element (10) to induce a shift in phase from the light beams (22, 24) diffracted by the grating 
structures (14, 16). An offset of one half the period will cause a Π shift in the phase between beams 

(22, 24) diffracted by two multilevel surface relief phase grating structures (14, 16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a binary diffractive optical element, and, more particularly, to 
phase control by a binary diffractive optical element by spatial displacement of the structure of the 
binary diffractive optical element along its surface. The propagation of a light beam can be changed by three basic means: reflection by a 
mirror, refraction by a lens and diffraction by a grating. Optical systems traditionally rely on 
reflection and refraction to achieve the desired optical transformation. Optical design, based on 
mirror and lens elements, is a well-established and refined process. Until recently, the problems with 
diffraction and fabricating high efficiency diffractive elements have made diffractive elements 
unfeasible components of optical systems. The diffractive process does not simply redirect a light beam. Diffraction, unlike 
refraction and reflection, splits a light beam into many beams -- each of which is redirected at a 
different angle or order. The percentage of the incident light redirected by the desired angle into 
some given diffraction order is referred to as the diffraction efficiency for that order. The diffraction 
efficiency of a diffractive element is determined by the element's surface profile. If the light that is 
not redirected by the desired angle is substantial, the result will be an intolerable amount of scatter in 
the image or output plane of the optical system. Theoretically, on-axis diffractive phase elements consisting of a grating having a given 
period can achieve 100 percent diffraction efficiency. To achieve this efficiency, however, a 
continuous phase profile within any given period is necessary. The theoretical diffraction efficiency 
of this surface profile is also relatively sensitive to a change in wavelength. By contrast, refractive 
elements are relatively wavelength insensitive. The technology for producing high quality, high 
efficiency, continuous phase profiles of the diffraction does not presently exist. A compromise that results in a relatively high diffraction efficiency and ease of 
fabrication is a multi-level phase grating. The larger the number of discrete phase levels, the better 
the approximation of the continuous phase function. These multi-level phase profiles can be 
fabricated using standard semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication techniques. As disclosed in Binary Optics Technology:The Theory and Design of Multi-level
