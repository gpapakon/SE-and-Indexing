<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for cutting lengths of a backlining running off from a stock roll and for assembling it in an exact position together with supplied cover boards in a roll-on device for the mechanical production of book covers, having a pair of cut-length transport rollers for drawing the backlining forwards and positioning it in a cutting device, and having a series of pairs of lead-in rollers for conveying the backlining cut-to-length through a transport channel into the roll-on device. To achieve very high cutting accuracy and for assembling the backlining and cover board in an exact position, provision is made for the pair of cut-length transport rollers (3) and the pairs of lead-in rollers (4-6) to be drivable intermittently by a common regulating servomotor (12) and, after a specific draw-off length of the backlining (1) has been obtained, for the cut-length transport rollers (3a, 3b) to be capable of being brought into an ineffective state, and for the cutting device (9) to be assigned a clamping device holding the backlining (1). Arranged in the apparatus are, furthermore, control means (14, 17) for positioning the cut-to-length backlining (1) in a stand-by position in the transport channel (2) and for releasing the cut-to-length backlining (1) in time synchronism with the intermittently supplied cover boards (1a).

Apparatus for cutting to length portions of a spine
insert (1) running off a supply reel, and for bringing

them together, in a positionally accurate manner, with
cover boards (1a) which are fed in, in a roller

applicator (7, 8) for the mechanised manufacture of
book covers, the said apparatus having a pair (3) of

cut length transport rollers for drawing the said
spine insert forward and positioning it in a cutting

device (9), and a series of pairs (4-6) of lead-in
rollers for conveying the cut-to-length spine insert

through a transport channel (2) and into the roller
applicator, characterised in that the pair (3) of cut

length transport rollers and the pairs (4-6) of lead-in
rollers can be driven cyclically by a jointly

regulated servomotor (12) and the cut length transport
rollers (3a, 3b) can be brought, after a defined

drawing-off length of the spine insert (1) has been
reached, into an ineffective condition, that a

clamping device (10) which holds the spine insert (1)
is assigned to the cutting device (9) and that there

are provided control means (14, 17) for positioning
the cut-to-length spine insert (1) in a waiting

position in the transport channel (2) and for
releasing the said cut-to-length spine insert (1) in

synchronism with the cover boards (1a) which are fed
in cyclically, and a regulating device (15-17) for

continuously balancing the drive of the servomotor
(12) with the movement of the cover boards (1a) as a

master drive.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that
the pair (3) of cut length transport rollers is formed

by a roller (3a), which is directly driven by the
servo motor (12), and by a roller (3b) which is

driven, together with the said roller (3a), by 
frictional contact and the distance of which from the

opposing roller (3a) can be varied via actuating means
(11) for the purpose of transferring it into the

ineffective condition.
