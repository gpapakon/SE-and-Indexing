laminate material, the multi-layer laminate material having: a 

polyethylene layer; a barrier layer made of a substance selected 
from the group consisting of polyamide resins, saponified 

derivatives of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, thermoplastic 
polyesters, and a mixture of at least two of the polyamide 

resin, the saponified derivative and the thermoplastic 
polyester; and an adhesive layer made of a modified polyolefin

polyethylene which is obtained by using a 

specific chrome catalyst and a reducing agent, and which has a 
high-load melt flow rate (at a temperature of 190°C under a load 

of 21.6 kg) of 1 to 10 g/10 min., and a density of not less than 
0.935 g/cm³. The hollow multi-layer molding has excellent

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hollow multi-layer 
molding, and particularly to a hollow multi-layer molding that 
has excellent barrier properties (permeation-preventing 
properties) with respect to vehicle fuels (such as gasoline) and 
mixtures of hydrocarbons with oxygen-containing organic 
compounds (such as gasoline containing alcohol, i.e., gasohol), 
has excellent mechanical strength, such as impact strength, and 
is capable of being produced while allowing flash or the like to 
be recovered and reused (i.e., reclaimed) in an improved manner. Fuel tanks for vehicles have, through various 
approaches, been made of plastic materials by using blow molding 
techniques so as to achieve advantages such as improved safety 
upon impact, and improved freedom of shape design. Properties required of plastic products to be used as 
fuel tanks include excellent properties for preventing 
permeation of fuel (gas barrier properties), and mechanical 
strength, such as impact strength, sufficient to be able to 
serve as fuel tanks. Polyolefin, which is relatively cheap and which has 
excellent impact strength and similar mechanical strengths, is a 
material which may be suitably used to produce plastic fuel 
tanks. However, since polyolefin has poor gas barrier 
properties, various improvements have been proposed. These proposals include a chemical treatment method in  
 
which the inner surface of a polyolefin tank is chemically 
treated with fluorine gas (F2) or sulfur trioxide gas (SO3), and 
a laminar method in which layers of modified polyamide 
comprising a combination of polyamide having relatively good 
barrier properties and polyolefin substituted by an 
alkylcarboxyl group, are formed in a continuous matrix phase of 
polyolefin. However, these methods are not yet capable of assuring 
barrier properties sufficient for this use, and cannot be 
regarded as perfect since it may not be easy, with these 
methods, to cope with various environmental protection legal 
regulations which are expected to be more strict in the future. 
In addition, the laminar method has a problem in that the 
laminar state of modified polyamide tends to be unstable under 
some forming conditions, thereby involving the risk of reducing 
impact strength. The chemical treatment method has problems 
concerning the durability of treatment effect and a problem 
concerning environmental protection during the process. Another proposal is made, for example, in Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 1-14049, which is a multi-layer formation
