<ABSTRACT>
A conche having at least one rotor shaft (4) with conching tools (5) is divided into compartments (13-16) by means of partitions (10, 11, 12), in such a way that different recipes can be conched simultaneously in the said compartments (13-16). The rotor shaft passages (17) through the partitions (10, 11, 12) between the compartments (13-16) are sealed off by means of plate springs (18) in such a way that no chocolate compound is transported from one compartment (13-16) to another one. As the conche only includes one drive (8) and only two bearing units (6, 7) for each rotor shaft (4), a cost-effective and space-saving device is produced which is versatile in use. This means, for example, that different recipes can be conched at the same time or the same recipe can be conched in the different compartments (13-16) at staggered times.

Conching apparatus for conching chocolate 
masses in batches, comprising a trough and at 

least one rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 4c) with thereto 
attached and radially protruding tools (5) lying 

at a radial distance from the latter, with a 
common drive (8) provided for said rotorshaft 

(4a, 4b, 4c), and with provision for at least two 
compartments (13 - 16) for separate rubbing and 

joining of chocolate masses having each at least 

one filler opening (22 - 25) and each at least 
one outlet opening in such a manner that there 

can be no exchange of chocolate mass between the 
compartments (13 - 16) whilst the chocolate mass 

can be discharged or pumped out through a 
respective discharge opening (26, 27) following a 

respective processing period which suits a 
respective recipe and torque, 
characterised in 
that
a) the at least one rotorshaft (4) passes 
horizontally through the compartments (13 - 16), 

and the conching tools (5) of all compartments 
(13 - 16) are mounted on the at least one 

communal rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 4c); 
b) the at least one rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 4c) is 
only mounted on both trough ends; 
c) the compartments are separated from each 
other by at least one separating wall (10, 11, 

12) which is arranged transversely to a 
rotorshaft (4), and in this at least one 

separating wall (10, 11, 12) is arranged a 
throughbore (17) for each rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 

4c); and 
d) each throughbore (17) is associated with at 
least one seal (18, 19) with a sealing grinding  

 
part so that the rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 4c) which 

vibrates under load can move within the 
throughbores (17) transversely to the rotary axis 

of the rotorshaft (4). 
Conching apparatus according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the seal (18, 19) embraces 
a cup spring (18), preferably made of metal and 

in particular of steel, which is preferably 
mounted on the separating wall (10, 11, 12) and 

establishes on a grinding surface, arranged 
transversely to the rotary axis of a press-on 

ring (19), which is seated on the shaft (4) and 
presses the cup spring (18) against the 

separating wall (10, 11, 12), a grinding seal and 
permits both a shaft rotation and a shaft 

deflection transversely to the rotary axis. 
Conching apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 at least two compartments 
(13 - 16) have their own cooling or heating 

circuit (30 - 35) and that an insulation layer is 
provided in the separating wall which is passed 

through by the communal rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 4c), 
preferably between at least two compartments with 

separate cooling circuits. 
Conching apparatus according to one of the 
above claims, 
characterised in that
 between at 
least two adjacent compartments (13 - 16) are 

arranged two respective separating walls (10a, 
10b; 11a, 11b; 12a, 12b) which are passed through 

by the communal rotorshaft (4a, 4b, 4c), 
preferably at a distance which forms an airgap 

(37), and the two separating walls (10a, 10b; 
11a, 11b; 12a, 12b) are interconnected by a  

 
preferably conical tubular piece (36) in such a 

manner that the at least one rotorshaft (4) 
passes through this tubular piece (36).
