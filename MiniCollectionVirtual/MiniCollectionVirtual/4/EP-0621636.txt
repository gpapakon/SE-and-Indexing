<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated structure
protection device for the protection of logic-level power MOS
(MOSFET, IGBT and so on) devices against electro static
discharges.MOS devices are more and more employed in power electronics
thanks to the simplicity of the circuits necessary for their
driving operation and to their switching performances.Among power MOS devices, those which can be directly driven
by logic-level signal (called logic-level power MOS) hold a
significant market share. In their most common use, logic-level
power MOS can be directly driven by a microprocessor.Since it is known that most logic families have logic-level
voltage values compatible with those of the TTL technology, it
follows that logic-level power MOS must have threshold voltage
values ranging from 1V to 2V: in fact, they shall remain in the
"off" state for gate driving voltages between 0V and 0.8V
(corresponding to the "0" logic level), while they shall drain
the nominal current when the gate voltage is higher than 2.4V
(corresponding instead to the "1" logic level).Due to the low value of the threshold voltage, these devices
are labeled with the letters LT (Low Threshold).In order to achieve said threshold voltage values, it is
necessary for logic-level MOS power devices to have a gate
oxide layer that is rather thin, with thickness typically
ranging from 30 nm to 80 nm. Such a thin layer can be 
permanently damaged if a voltage higher than a few tens of
volts is applied to the gate of the device. For this reason
logic-level power MOS are particularly affected by Electro
Static Discharges (ESD) problems.To prevent ESD failures, manufacturers of logic-level power
MOS devices provide said devices with integrated structure
protections, usually made up of diodes.Such protections, however, set two opposing kind of limits:
the first is represented by the breakdown voltage of each of
said diodes, while the second deals with the series resistance
introduced by the diodes.Each diode should have a breakdown voltage higher than the
maximum driving voltage of the power MOS device, in order to
prevent it from draining current from the driving circuit of
the power MOS device. Since diodes obtained from p+/n+
junctions exhibit low breakdown voltages (with values even
below 5V), it is necessary to connect a plurality of such
diodes in series.Another possibility is represented by the use of p/n+
junction diodes, which generally have breakdown voltages of the
order of 10V.If, however, the series resistance introduced by the
