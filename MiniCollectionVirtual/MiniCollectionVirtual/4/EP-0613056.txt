<ABSTRACT>
The film comprises a base layer 1 of filled 
polyester, coated with a toner-receptive layer 2 of 

filled polyvinyl alcohol having a surface roughness of 
3 to 15µm, and with a photosensitive emulsion layer 3. 

The film can be imaged in a laser printer, applied to a 
printing screen, the screen exposed, 
the film removed 
to leave the photosensitive layer, and the 

photosensitive layer developed to produce a printing 
screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to origination films for 
use in screen printing. In a widely used method of preparation of screen 
printing stencils an emulsion which is sensitive to 
actinic light is brought in contact with a woven screen 
and dried to form a photoresist. A origination film 
consisting of a film carrier carrying a positive image 
is placed in contact with the dry photoresist and the 
whole is exposed to high intensity actinic light, 
generally provided by a mercury-metal halide source, or 
a UV-fluorescent tube. The areas of photoresist struck by the light 
cross-link and harden: the areas protected by the 
image area of the positive remain unhardened. On 
subsequent development, usually by water washing, the 
unhardened areas, which remain soluble, are removed, 
leaving a stencil having a negative image in the open 
areas of the screen. During the subsequent printing 
operation, ink is forced through the open areas of the 
stencil onto a suitable stock, thereby reproducing the 
original positive image. Generally, the positive image 
is made using high contrast silver films: in the case 
of colour printing, colour separations have to be 
produced, necessitating one silver photographic film 
for each colour to be printed. The cost of the silver 
films used in the process can be very considerable. Recently there has been considerable interest in 
the use of digitised information in printing processes. 
Such information can be created and manipulated on a 
computer, without the production of hard copy, until 
all changes have been satisfactorily completed. Clearly, it is desirable to be able to produce a 
screen printing origination film by an 
electrophotographic process, for example in a laser  
 
printer or photocopier, where such production can be 
under direct computer control and can avoid or minimise 
the preparation of any intermediate hard copy. Laser printers and photocopiers have however 
certain characteristics which would lead to 
disadvantages in the direct production of a screen 
printing origination film. Two such characteristics 
are: 
(a) The image produced by laser printers tends not to 
to be totally continuous and contains defects, 
among which are pinholes. If not corrected, this 
will create spots of hardened stencil material 
during exposure, which will lead to 'speckling' of 
the final print. (b) The image produced by a laser printer is 
susceptible to central void formation - the 
reduction of image density at the centre of solid 
'blocks' of the black image. The present
