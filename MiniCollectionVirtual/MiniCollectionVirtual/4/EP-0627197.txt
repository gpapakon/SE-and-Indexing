<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a collection assembly useful for collecting 
small quantities of blood. The assembly comprises a container with an 

integral lip for facilitating collection of the blood and a cap suitable for 
enclosing the container. The assembly further comprises a sealing 

arrangement for securing the cap with the container and a cam arrangement 
for unsecuring the cap from the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collection assembly and more particularly 
to a microcollection container and cap suitable for collecting small quantities 
of blood from a patient and maintaining the blood in secure fashion for 
subsequent testing. Analytical instrumentation has made it possible to carry out a variety 
of hematological diagnostic procedures on very small quantities of blood. 
Because of this, a patient's finger or earlobe, for example, may be punctured 
and a very small quantity of blood may be rapidly collected into a container 
for such testing. However, in order to carry out testing and analysis on small 
quantities of blood, the blood must be rapidly collected prior to any 
coagulation thereof. A collection arrangement as described in US-A-4,397,318, 
has been provided wherein a cap is configured to fit the top of a 
microcollection container with the cap having a removable capillary scoop for 
engaging the puncture site and transferring blood to the container. However, 
with such an arrangement, if precise positioning is not carried out, capillary 
action is not initiated or slowed and the collected blood will clot.  
 Moreover, when a sample is taken with this collection 
arrangement, blood droplets may be left in and around 
the top area of the container. When the scoop is removed 
from the cap and the cap is fitted onto the top of the 
container, the excess blood may be forced onto the outside 
surface of the container. A collection assembly comprising the features of the 
precharacterizing part of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 
517 119. In this collection assembly, the outer skirt of 
the cap has at its lower end a rim that abuts against a 
cap seating flange of the container when the cap is 
placed on the container. The seating flange of the container 
has a planar upper surface and the rim of the cap 
has a planar lower surface. When it happens that excess 
fluid is on the outside surface of the collector of the 
container, upon placing the cap onto the container, the 
excess fluid is pushed downwardly by the cap and will be 
squeezed between the cap and the cap seating flange of 
the container, thus causing radial spray of the fluid to 
the environment. Further, it may be difficult to remove 
the cap from the container because the cap is held on 
the container by a snap fit. DE-U-92 01 222 discloses a sample container closed by a 
cap. The sample container comprises on its open end 
triangular lugs for cooperating with triangular cam 
followers provided on a flange of the cap,

<CLAIMS>
A fluid collection assembly comprising: 

a cap (14) comprising a closed portion comprising a top portion (54) 
and an inner skirt portion (64), an 

open bottom portion, an annular skirt (58) extending 
from said top portion (54) to said bottom portion 

and having an inner surface (62) and an outer surface 
(60), an inner skirt portion (64) surrounded by 

said inner surface (62) of said annular skirt (58) 
and extending from said top portion (54) toward said 

bottom portion, an annular space (68) between said 
inner surface (62) of said annular skirt (58) and 

said inner skirt portion (64), and 
a container (12) comprising an open top portion 
(28), a closed bottom portion (30), a sidewall (22) 

extending from said top portion (28) to said bottom 
portion (30) and having an inner (26) and an outer 

surface (24), a collector made integrally with the 
container and extending from said top portion (28), 

and a cap seating flange (40) associated with said 
outer surface (26) of said sidewall (22),
characterized in that
the cap (14) comprises a cam follower (74) extending 
from said bottom portion of said annular skirt (58) 

and the container comprises at least one lug (44) 
having a cam surface (46) for cooperating with the 

cam follower (74) of the cap (14), and 
that the container (12) comprises a reservoir (42) 
positioned within said cap seating flange (40) for  

 
taking in excess fluid adhering to the outside surface 

of the collector, when the cap is being placed 
on the container, said cam surface (46) being positioned 

in said reservoir (42). 
The assembly of claim 1, further comprising: 

a locking ring (48) on said outer surface of said 
container (12) positioned between said collector and 

said cap seating flange (40), 
at least one protrusion (70) positioned on said inner 
surface (62) of said annular skirt (58) of said 

cap (14), 
a sealing ring (67) on said inner skirt portion (64) 
of said cap (14), and 
a rim (76) extending from said outer surface (60) of 
said annular skirt (58) of said cap (14),
 
wherein said protrusion (70) bears against said 

locking ring (48) of said container (12), said sealing 
ring (67) bears against said inner surface (26) 

of said top portion (28) of said container (12). 
The assembly of claim 2, wherein said lug (44) and 
said cam follower (74) are triangularly shaped, so 

that for removing the cap from said container a bi-directional 
rotational force may be applied to said 

cap around the longitudinal axis of the cap (14) to  
 

cause said cam follower (74) of said cap to rise on 
said cam surface of said container. 
The assembly of one of claims 1-3, wherein said inner 
skirt portion (54) of said cap is recessed from 

said bottom portion and said annular skirt (58) of 
said cap (14) extends beyond said inner skirt portion 

(54). 
The assembly of one of claims 1-4, further comprising 
an annular skirt (37) extending from said closed 

bottom portion of said container (12). 
The assembly of one of claims 1-5, wherein
 
the dimensions of the annular skirt (58) and of the 

open top portion (28) of the container (12) are such 
that said outer surface (24) of said top portion (28) 

of said container (12) is separated from said inside 
surface (62) of said annular skirt (58) of said cap 

(14) by an annular space (69) when the cap is placed 
over the open top portion of the container.
