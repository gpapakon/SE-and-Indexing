<ABSTRACT>
In order reliably to test the safe operation of contacts of switches (SKa, SKc) or relays which control a control device, with regard to whether they adopt the desired break-contact position and/or are at sufficiently high supply voltage, the break contacts (RK) of the two switches can be connected in parallel, each via one electrical resistor (R1, R2), to a pole (N) of the voltage source and both resistors can be connected in series to a charging capacitor (C1). The latter, when a particular electrical charging or voltage (threshold voltage) is reached, activates the control device and, in particular, supplies a threshold switch (SS) or itself acts as such.

A circuit arrangement for testing two series-connected contacts. 
which can be applied to a voltage source, of switches or relays which 

are controllable by a control device, characterised in that the rest 

contacts (RK) of the two switches (SKa, SKc) can be connected in 
parallel by way of a respective electrical resistor (R1, R2) to a pole 

(N) of the voltage source which by way of the parallel circuit of the 
two resistors (R1, R2) charges up a charging capacitor (C1) which 

activates the control device upon the attainment of a given electrical 
charge or electrical voltage. 
A circuit arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the charging capacitor (C1) is connected to the control device by way 

of a threshold switch (SS). 
A circuit arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the series circuit of the two resistors (R1, R2) 

is connected to the charging capacitor (C1) by way of a coupling 
resistor (R3) and a rectifier (D). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the two resistors (R1, R2) have difference ohmic 

values and that the series circuit of the one resistor (R1) with the 
coupling resistor (R3) is of high resistance relative to the series 

circuit of the coupling resistor (R3) with the parallel circuit of the 
two resistors (R1, R3). 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a protective circuit detects the failure of one 

of the two contacts of the switches (SKa, SKc) and blocks the control 
device. 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that an undervoltage detection circuit (USP) detects 

inadequate charging of the charging capacitor (C1) in the case of the 
rest contact circuit of the two switches (SKa, SKc) and inadequate  

 
mains voltage and prevents the control device from coming into 

operation. 
Use of the circuit arrangement according to one or more of the 
preceding claims for an automatic firing arrangement with the proviso 

that a switching contact is associated with the switch (SKa) or relay 
(A) of a pressure monitor and the other switching contact is associated 

with the switch (SKc) or relay (C) for a fuel valve (BV).
