<ABSTRACT>
A hinge for linking the free partial wing (16b) to the partial wing (16a) linked to the body of a two-part corner-cupboard door wing having two attachments (24) allocated to the partial wings which can pivot relatively to each other by means of a pivot pin (38) passing through aligned bores in the region of the frontal partial wing edges facing each other. The two attachments take the form of elongated supporting arms (24) on which one end of a pivot arm (60) is pivotably connected while the other ends are pivotably coupled together. At least one of the pivot arms (60) is coupled on the attachment side to a sliding member (42) which is guided to move longitudinally in relation to the supporting arm (24) and forced by a spring into an end position, whereby the length of the pivot arms is such that, in their extended position tending to hold the door wings closed, they maintain the partial wings (16a; 16b) in a position at right angles to each other, while it is still possible to pivot the free partial wing (16b; 16b) in a position at right angles to each other, while it is still possible to pivot the free partial wing (16b) further to the extent of the travel of the sliding member(s) (42).

<CLAIMS>
Hinge (20) for linking the free door leaf (16b) of a bipartite corner cabinet 
door to the carcase-linked door leaf (16a) hung by means of a hinge (18) on the 

carcase supporting wall, consisting of two hinge leaves associated one with each of 
the door leaves, which can rotate by means of hinge pins (38) passing through 

aligned bores (36) in the area of the confronting front door leaf edges from the 
position holding the door leaves in the closed state of the corner cabinet at 

approximately right-angles to one another by approximately 90Â° into a position in 
which they are substantially parallel and in line with one another when the corner 

cabinet door is open, the two hinge leaves having each at least one angular 
appendage (34) extending from in front of the edge face of the associated door 

leaf into the area of its front arris, in the extremities of which, which are at 
different levels, the bores (36) for the hinge pins are provided,
characterized
in that the two hinge leaves are in the form of elongated supporting arms 
(24) adjustably held on a mounting plate (22) that is to be fastened on the inside 

of the corresponding door leaf (16a; 16b), 
that on each of the hinge leaves the one end of a link (60) is articulated, 
the other ends being articulated to one another, and 
that at least one of the links (60) is linked at the hinge leaf end to a 
thruster (42) guided for displacement resiliently relative to the supporting arm 

(24) in the direction of its length and urged to an end position, the length of the 
two links (60) being made such that in their outstretched position associated with 

the closed position of the door leaf they hold the door leaves (16a; 16b) in the 
position aligned at right angles to one another, but an additional turning of the 

free door leaf (16b) in the sense of reducing the right angle included between the  
 

door leaves (16a; 16b) within the range of movement of the thruster or thrusters 
(42) is possible by overdrawing the free door leaf (16b). 
Hinge according to claim 1, characterized in that the hinge leaf associated 
with the free door leaf (16b) and the one associated with the carcase-linked door 

leaf (16a) are of identical configuration. 
Hinge according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the angular 
appendages (34) have each two parallel, spaced-apart knuckles (34a; 34b) 

between which there is an interval that is slightly greater than the width of a 
knuckle. 
Hinge according to claim 3, characterized in that one (34a) of the knuckles 
(34a, 34b) of each hinge leaf is disposed laterally in line with one of the lateral 

flanges of the supporting arm (24), while the other knuckle (34b) is offset 

outwardly from the other lateral flange. 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
thruster or thrusters (42) and the mounting plates (22) holding them adjustably 

are configured the same as the supporting arms (24) and corresponding mounting 
plates (22) of conventional cabinet hinges for hanging doors on a cabinet carcase. 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
thruster or thrusters (42) are disposed for lengthwise displacement in the end 

portion of the supporting arm or arms (24) in the angular appendage area, and  
 

one end of the associated thruster (42) protrudes through an opening (44) in the 
supporting arm, and the associated link (60) is journaled on an axis parallel to the 

pivot axis of the hinge (20), and that the thruster (42) is biased by a pretensioned 
spring directly or indirectly supported at one end in the interior of the 

supporting arm (24) and at the other end in the thruster (42), to a position 
largely withdrawn into the supporting arm (24). 
Hinge according to claim 6, characterized in that the spring is a helical 
spring held under compressive stress between a transverse wall of the thruster 

(42) remote from the angular appendage and an abutment affixed to the 
supporting arm. 
Hinge according to claim 7, characterized in that the abutment affixed to 
the supporting arm is formed by a pin (48) held in the lateral flanges of the 

supporting arm (24) and extending transversely through the supporting arm. 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the links 
(60) have at their extremities linked to the thruster (42) two bearing projections 

(58) straddling the associated thruster (42) with bores (56) aligned with a bore 
(52) provided in the thruster (42), and that the bores (52; 56) in the thruster 

(42) and in the bearing projections (58) of the links (60) are pierced by a pin 
(54). 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that at the 
ends of the links (60) remote from the thruster, two laterally spaced-apart bearing 

lugs (64a, 64b) are provided, whose distance apart is approximately equal to or  
 

only slightly greater than their width, and that the bearing lugs (64a, 64b) are 
offset laterally from the longitudinal central axis of the links (60) such that the 

longitudinal central axes of the two links articulated together are aligned by a pin 
(66) pass through the bearing bores in the bearing lugs (64a, 64b). 
Hinge according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the links (60) are 
flat, elongated plastic, injection-molded parts, and that the bearing lugs (64a, 

64b) and/or bearing projections (64a; 64b) are thickened to form bearing eyes. 
Hinge according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the links (60) are 
pressure-cast metal or stamped from sheet metal. 
Hinge according to one or more of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the 
thruster (42) is an injection-molded plastic part. 
Hinge according to one or more of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the 
thruster (42) is a metal part.
