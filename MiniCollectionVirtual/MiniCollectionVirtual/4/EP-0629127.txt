<DESCRIPTION>
An Incontinence GuardIhe present invention relates to an incontinence guard, i.e. an auxiliary device for male incraπtinent who are unable to control their evacuative functions.It is cαπparitively normal for males to suffer light incontinence, and various types of incontinence guards are available for males who suffer in this way. One such ___ncoπtinence guard has the form of a funnel which contains a liquid-absorbing substance. The guard is intended to placed around the penis and held in position by the wearer's underclothes. This guard is also extremely effective for people who suffer heavy ___nccntinence, since the guard is able to absorb a relatively large amount of liquid.Ihere are also people, however, who suffer very slight ij_coπtinence, for example people who discharge involuntarily from 5 to 15 drops of urine every twelve hours or so. This affliction raiders it necessary to use same form of guard or protection. Many people consider this affliction so slight as to render the use of the aforesaid guard too troublesome and uncomfortable to be worthwhile.The present invention relates to an incontinence guard which is' discrete and which will not cause discomfort to the wearer.The present invention thus relates to an incontinence guard for males who are slightly incontinent, and is characterized in that the guard has the form of a hood which is fitted onto the forward part of the penis and which is made from the same material and has generally the same cross-sectional dimensions as a condom; and in that when in use the hood has a length from about 3 to 5 centimeters.The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof illustrated in the ac_craιpaπying drawing, in which Figure 1 shows an inventive incontience guard in its position of use. 

The inventive guard is comprised of a hood 1 which is intended, to be fitted over the front end of the wearer's penis. The hood 1 is made of the same material as a condom and has generally the same cross- sectional dimensions as a cαndcm. The inventive guard can also be manufactured by the same te miques as those used to manufacture condoms. When in use, the hood, has a length of about 3 to 6 centimeters.The limited length of the hood, means that the guard will only be seated on the front part of the penis, and the skin on the remaining part of the penis will breath normally. This means that the hood, can be worn comfortably and that the guard will not give rise to the same feelings of discomfort as those caused
