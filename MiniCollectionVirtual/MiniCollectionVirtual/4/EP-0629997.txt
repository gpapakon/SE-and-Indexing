<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to voice communication method 
and apparatus and it is an object that when the acceptable 

vocabulary or grammar is dynamically changed in accordance 
with a communication state, a troublesomeness for allowing 

the user to again utter a speech which does not correspond 
to the predicted vocabulary and which cannot be acceptable 

is eliminated. For the above purpose, the speech which 
cannot be perceived is handled as an unknown word, a 

question to induce an answer such that the unknown word 
becomes included the acceptable vocabulary is performed, 

and the unknown word portion is reevaluated at a time point 
when the unknown word becomes included the acceptable 

vocabulary due to the induced answer. Thus, the user does 
not need to again utter the same answer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for
recognising input speech and for obtaining the speaking
intention of the speaker.The invention also relates to method and apparatus
for recognising a speech in consideration of the
communication situation with a speaker.i) Hitherto, in the speech perception in the voice
communication, a high efficiency of processes is realized
by limiting the vocabulary, sentences, or the like which
can be received. On the other hand, there is a technique
such that the user predicts words to be uttered next from
a flow of communication, thereby effectively limiting the
vocabulary, sentence, or the like.ii) There is also a technique which models
vocabulary, sentences, and the like which cannot be
accepted and used them together, and detecting cases
where the user utters the modelled vocabulary, sentences,
or the like.iii) Hitherto, there is a technique such that for
a word which cannot be recognised, the user is prompted
to again utter the same word and the speech which was
again input is changed to a different recognition method.According to the conventional technique (i), even 
if the speech which will be uttered next by the user is
effectively predicted, a possibility such that the user
will utter another vocabulary, sentence, or the like
which cannot be accepted still remains. Now, even if the
models of the vocabulary, sentence, and the like which
cannot be accepted are used by the conventional technique
(ii), when the user utters the vocabulary, sentence, or
the like which cannot be accepted, a fact that "the user
uttered vocabulary, sentence, or the like which cannot
be accepted" can be merely detected and which word the
user uttered cannot be recognised. Therefore, after the
acceptable vocabulary, sentence, or the like was
modified, the user needs to utter again the content which
was previously uttered. There is a problem such that
such an operation is difficult for the user and any
feeling of ease of use is lost.According to the conventional technique (iii), the
user must repetitively utter the same word many times
until the system can accurately recognise it, so that
ease of use is lost.In accordance with a first aspect of the present
invention there is provided a voice recognition method
as set out in claim 1.In accordance with a further aspect of the invention
there is provided voice recognition apparatus as set out
in claims 6 and 11. The invention intends to provide voice communication
method and apparatus in which the acceptable vocabulary
is dynamically
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A voice recognition method in which an acceptable speech vocabulary
is dynamically changed in accordance with a communication situation,

comprising the steps of :

detecting from an input speech an unknown word which cannot be
recognised by the acceptable speech vocabulary; and
reevaluating the unknown word portion by the acceptable speech
vocabulary as changed by information obtained after the speech

which included the detected unknown word had been input.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said
reevaluation of the unknown word portion is executed with

respect to an input speech information which had been
input before the just previous speech information had

been input.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said
information is a category information of a category to

which the unknown word belongs, and wherein this
information is extracted from the speech information

including the unknown word.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the
communication situation is judged by determining the

category to which the unknown word belongs.  
A method according to claim 4, wherein a reply
sentence to eliminate the unknown word is determined by

the judged communication situation.
A speech communication apparatus comprising:

changing means for dynamically changing an
acceptable speech vocabulary in accordance with a

communication situation; and
unknown word detecting means for detecting an unknown
word which cannot be perceived by the acceptable speech

vocabulary from an input speech;
reevaluating means for reevaluating the unknown word
portion by the acceptable speech vocabulary changed by

information obtained after the speech including the
detected unknown word had been input.
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said
reevaluating means

executes a reevaluation of the unknown word portion with respect to an input speech
information which had been input before the just previous speech information had been input.
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said
information is a category information of a category to

which the unknown word belongs, and wherein this
information is extracted by a category extracting means

from the speech information including the unknown word.
An Apparatus according to claim 8, further having 
judging means adapted to judge the communication

situation by determining the category to which the
unknown word belongs.
Apparatus according to claim 9, further having reply
sentence deciding means for deciding a reply sentence to

eliminate the unknown word by judging the communication
situation.
Speech recognition apparatus comprising means for
detecting speech input unknown to a data base in the

apparatus, means for requesting verbal clarification, and
means for altering the data base of the apparatus in

response to the clarification.
