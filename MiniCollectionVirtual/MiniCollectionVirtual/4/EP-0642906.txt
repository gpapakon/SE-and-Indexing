<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a molded part made of thermoplastic resin to which a 
foaming agent is added and including a protector body (51) having lock portions 

(56) serving as a strength required area, a lid element (52), and a hinge (54) 
between the protector body (51) and the lid element (52) and having a wall 

thickness less than that of the protector body (51) and the lid element (52), wherein 
the thermoplastic resin forming the protector body (51) including the lock portions 

(56) contains no foams but the thermoplastic resin forming the lid element (52) 
contains foams on opposite side of the hinge (54) from the protector body (51), 

thereby accomplishing a reduced weight and an ensured strength of the strength 
required area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a molded part made of
foamed thermoplastic resin employed as a protector or the
like for an automotive wiring harness and to a method of
fabricating the same.Wiring harnesses used for wiring in an automotive electric
system are generally protected by protectors,
as described in US-A-481 471,
so as not
to be damaged by a flash formed by punching in a press
molded vehicular body.Such protectors include e.g. a protector 100 shown in
Fig. 7. The protector 100 comprises a body portion 101 of a
U-shaped cross-sectional configuration, and an opening and
closing lid 102 for closing an open surface of the body
portion 101. The body portion 101 and the lid 102 are coupled
to each other with a hinge 103 which is thinner than
the body portion 101 and lid 102. The protector 100 as
above constructed is fabricated by injection molding using
thermoplastic resin such as polypropylene.There has been a need for weight reduction of automotive
vehicles for various reasons, and the protector 100 is
no exception. One of the approaches to reduce the weight of
a molded part of thermoplastic resin such as a protector is
to foam the molded part. Such a foamed molded part is
formed by adding a foaming agent to thermoplastic resin to
plasticize the thermoplastic resin, and injecting the plasticized
thermoplastic resin into a mold. In the past, and
as it is generally known in this art, plasticating conditions
in the fabricating steps of a foamed molded part have
been merely to contain foams in the resin throughout the
molded part.The protector 100 shown in Fig. 7 further comprises
lock portions 104 for closing the opening after the wiring
harness is housed in the protector 100 and a bolting portion 
105 for fixing the protector 100 on the vehicular
body. The lock portions 104 and the bolting portion 105 are
required to have a strength higher than that of other areas
and, hence, it is not preferred to form the lock portions
104 and the bolting portion 105 from the resin containing
foams. That is, the fabrication of the protector 100 by the
foam molding technique well-known in the art results in an
insufficient strength of the lock portions 104 and bolting
portion 105.DE-A-29 45 882 shows a molded part being made of thermoplastic
resin containing a foaming agent. The molded part
is comprised of two individual parts having a comparatively
high thickness which are coupled to each other by a hinge
portion with a comparatively low thickness. The two individual
parts have a different hardness, i.e. a

A molded part made of a single thermoplastic resin
to which a foaming agent is added, comprising:


a first thick-walled portion (51) including a strength
required unfoamed area,
a second thick-walled portion (52, 53) which does not
include said strength required area, and
a hinge portion (54, 55) formed between said first and
second thick-walled portions and having a wall thickness

of said hinge portion (54, 55) is not less than 0.4 mm

and not more than 0.6 mm.
The molded part of claim 1, said molded part being

protector body (51) of a U-shaped cross-sectional configuration,
a lid element (52, 53) for closing an open surface

of said protector body (51) , and a hinge portion (54, 55)
