<ABSTRACT>
In a steam condenser, the steam is precipitated onto tubes (pipes) (13) through which cooling water flows and which are combined into separate bundles. Each bundle is subdivided into compartments by support plates arranged perpendicular to the tubes. The tubes of a bundle, which are arranged in rows, enclose a cavity (19) in which there is arranged a cooler (3) for the non-condensable gases. The non-condensable gases pass from the cooler (3) via orifices (6) into a suction channel (4) which is common to all the compartments and extends over the entire length of the tubes (13). There is only one cooler (3), which is immediately adjoined by the suction channel (4), and the through-flow cross-sections of the orifices (6) in the compartments are dimensioned such that given the locally available pressure difference the local, non-condensable mass flow is exhausted.
