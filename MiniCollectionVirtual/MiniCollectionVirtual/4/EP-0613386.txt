body, consisting of an elastically flexible sheath (2), 

which is formed by sheath elements (11) lying one after 
another in the longitudinal direction, and a core (3),

the probe (1) a fixing (5a, 5b) between the sheath (2) and 

the core (3), and there being provided in the forward, 
distal region of the probe a forward fixing (4a, 4b) 

between the sheath (2) and the core (3) and a displacement 
spacing (S) between sheath (2) and core (3) being allowed,
 
characterised in that,
 
the displacement spacing is a displacement tolerance, 

whereby by bending (B) of the probe (1) in the rearward 
region thereof, projecting out of the body cavity, a 

relative displacement between the sheath (2) and the core 
(3) or a pushing or pulling force between the sheath (2) 

and the core (3) arises in that the sheath parts (11) lie 
against one another on the inner side of the bend (B), the 

displacement tolerance (S) being taken up, and on the 
outside of the bend are spaced apart from one another. 
Probe according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
one of the fixings is formed by a rigid fixing such as by 

clamping, welding, soldering or adhering and the other 
fixing is formed by a pair (5a, 5b, 4a, 4b) of longitudinal 

displacement limiting elements, which pair determines the 
displacement tolerance (S). 
Probe according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
that the sheath (2), at least in a rearward region or over 

the entire length thereof, is wound of a band or wire in 
the form of a helix, the windings (11) laying one against 

the other or at least a part of the windings having a  
 

spacing (a) from one another. 
Probe according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pair of longitudinal displacement limiting elements 

(5a, 5b, 4a, 4b) is in each case formed by means of a core 
head (6, 7) which cooperates with a facing shoulder (8, 9, 

13) of the sheath (2). 
Probe according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that,
 
the core heads (6, 7) cooperate with the ends (8, 9) of the 

sheath (2). 
Probe according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the ends thereof are similarly configured. 
Probe according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
there is associated therewith, preferably in the rearward 

region, a travel and/or force detector, in particular a 
pulling force detector (15), indicating the relative 

displacement. 
Probe according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that,
 
the travel and/or force detector (15) has a spring, in 

particular a compression spring (16), preferably in the 
form of a coil spring, in the rearward end region of the 

probe (1) between the sheath (2) and the displacement 
limiting element part (7) of the core (3). 
Probe according to claim 7 or 8,
 
characterised in that,
 
markings (19) corresponding with one another are provided 

on the sheath (2), or on components (15) attached to the  
 

sheath, and on the core (3), or on components attached to 
the core. 
Probe according to any of claims 7 to 9,
 
characterised in that,
 
the spacing between the displacement limiting element parts 

(6, 7) arranged on the core (3), if applicable including 
the travel and/or force detector (15), is greater than the 

spacing between the displacement limiting element parts 
(4b, 5b) associated with the sheath (2) and if applicable 

with the addition of the displacement tolerance (S), and in 
that a spacer (14) is associated with the probe (1), which 

spacer can be set between the rearward displacement 
limiting element part (7) associated with the core (3) and 

the rearward displacement limiting element part (5b) 
associated with the sheath (2) or the travel and/or force 

detector (15). 
Probe according to claim 10,
 
characterised in that,
 
the length (L) of the spacer (14) corresponds to the 

difference between the displacement limiting element parts 
(6, 7) associated with the core (3) and the displacement 

limiting element parts (4b, 5b) associated with the sheath 
(2), or is less than this difference by approximately the 

displacement tolerance (S1). 
Probe according to claim 10 or 11,
 
characterised in that,
 
the spacer (14) is formed by a U-profile piece. 
A method of using a probe (1) for medical procedures 
in cavities of the body, the probe consisting of an 

elastically flexible sheath (2), which is formed by sheath 
elements (11) lying one after another in the longitudinal 

direction, and a core (3), in the rearward, proximal region 
of the probe (1) a fixing (5a, 5b) is provided between the  

 
sheath (2) and the core (3), and that the sheath (2), at 

least in a rearward region or over the entire length 
thereof, is wound of a band or wire in the form of a helix, 

and at least a part of the windings having spacings (a)

displacement tolerance (S),
 
characterised in that,
 
by bending (B) of the probe (1) in the rearward region

pushing or pulling force between the sheath (2) and the 
core (3) is caused in that the sheath elements (11) come to

sheath (2), such as an injection needle (26), biopsy 

forceps (21) or a laterally deflectable guide end (24) of 
a so-called guide probe.
