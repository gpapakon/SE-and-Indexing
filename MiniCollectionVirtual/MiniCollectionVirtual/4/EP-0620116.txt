<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet printing
ink suitable for use in conducting textile printing, in
particular, on woven or nonwoven fabrics of cotton, silk
or the like, which are dyeable with reactive dyes and
composed principally of cellulose fibers and/or polyamide
fibers, or mixed woven or nonwoven fabrics composed of
these fibers and other fibers, and an ink-jet printing
process and an instrument making use of the ink. Further,
the present invention relates to processed articles
obtained by the ink-jet printing processes.At present, textile printing is principally
conducted by screen printing or roller printing. Both
processes are unfit for multi-kind small-quantity
production and difficult to quickly cope with the fashion
of the day. Therefore, there has recently been a demand
for development of an electronic printing system making no
use of any plate. In compliance with this demand, many
textile printing processes according to ink-jet recording
have been proposed. Various fields expect much from such 
textile printing processes.Ink-jet textile printing inks are required to have
the following performance characteristics:
(1) being able to color to a sufficient color depth
after conducting washing;(2) causing no clogging in an ejection nozzle;(3) being able to stably color upon fixing
treatment;(4) undergoing little irregular feathering on cloth;(5) undergoing no changes in physical properties and
ejection properties and depositing no solid matter in the
course of storage; and(6) undergoing no change in ejection properties even
in a long-time ejection durability test, and causing
neither disconnection nor deposition of foreign matter on
a heating head, in particular, in a case of textile
printing by a system making use of thermal energy.In order to satisfy these performance
characteristics required, the following means have
heretofore been proposed.First, in order to cope with the requirement (1), it
has been generally conducted to make the concentration of
a dye sufficiently high so as to give a satisfactory color
depth. This method is an essential means for using ink
droplets as minute as 200 pl or less, or conducting
textile printing on a cloth high in absorbing power. 
However, such an ink causes a problem of thickening due to
evaporation of water in the ink from an orifice of a
nozzle and the problem as to the requirement (2) because
of deposition of the dye as solid matter.It has therefore been conducted to add a polyhydric
alcohol such as glycerol to an ink in ink-jet recording on
co
