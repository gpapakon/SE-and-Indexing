<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
imidazonaphthyridine derivatives showing anti-allergic, 
anti-inflammatory and anti-asthmatic activities. U.S. Patent No. 4,994,468 discloses certain 4-thioimidazo[4,5-c]quinoline 
derivative showing bronchodilatory 
and anti-allergic activities. However, 4-thio- or 
4-substituted mercaptoimidazo[4,5-c][1,8]naphthyridine 
derivatives are unknown. The present invention relates to imidazonaphthyridine 
derivatives represented by Formula (I): 
wherein X-Y-Z represents 
[wherein R represents hydrogen, lower alkyl or -CH₂R¹ 
(wherein R¹ represents phenyl or pyridyl)] and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Compounds (I) wherein R is hydrogen can exist in the 
form of tautomers, namely Compounds (Ia), (Ia1) and/or 
(Ia2). All the tautomers are included in the scope of the 
present invention, and they are collectively referred to as 
Compound (Ia) in the following description. 
   In the definitions of the groups in Formula (I), lower 
alkyl means a straight-chain or branched alkyl group having 
1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, 
isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, 
neopentyl, and hexyl.  The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Compounds (I) 
include acid addition salts, metal salts, ammonium salts, 
organic amine addition salts, amino-acid addition salts. As the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts 
of Compound (I), inorganic acid addition salts such as 
hydrochloride, sulfate and phosphate, and organic acid 
addition salts such as acetate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate 
and citrate may be mentioned. As the pharmaceutically 
acceptable metal salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium 
salt and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as 
magnesium salt and calcium salt, aluminum salt, and zinc 
salt may be mentioned. As the pharmaceutically acceptable 
organic amine addition salts, salts with morpholine and 
piperidine are mentioned. As the pharmaceutically 
acceptable amino acid addition salts, salts with lysine, 
glycine, and phenylalanine may be mentioned. The processes for preparing Compounds (I) are described 
below. In the following processes, when the defined group is 
changed under the experimental condition or is inappropriate 
for practicing the processes, the processes can be readily 
carried out by applying the conventional manner in organic 
synthetic chemistry, for example, protection of functional 
groups and elimination of protecting groups. Compound (I) can be obtained by the
