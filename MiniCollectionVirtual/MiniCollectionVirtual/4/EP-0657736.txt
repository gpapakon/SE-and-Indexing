<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for measuring the composition of a liquid, in particular the composition of a motor vehicle fuel, characterised in that it comprises a casing (10) designed to hold the liquid whose composition is to be measured, means (20) capable of applying an acoustic wave to the liquid (L), and means (60) capable of measuring the velocity of the acoustic wave propagating through the liquid and of deducing the composition of the liquid from the measured velocity.

The use of a device for measuring the composition of a liquid contained in
a tank, the device comprising:
