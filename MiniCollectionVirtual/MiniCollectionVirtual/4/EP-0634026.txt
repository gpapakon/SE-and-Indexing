 OVERHEAD PROJECTOR FOR LCD PANELBackground of the Invention1. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to projection and display systems, and more particularly to an overhead projector having a computer integrated therein with several output ports for external devices, and having a unique interface card which electronically connects the overhead projector to a liquid crystal display panel and simultaneously aligns the panel with the stage of the overhead projector. The panel may be slidably or pivotally attached to the overhead projector.2. Description of the Prior Art Overhead projectors (OHP's) are known in the art, and generally consist of a base having a stage area, a light source to illuminate the stage, and a projector head which houses mirrors and lenses designed to project any image placed on the stage area onto a display screen. OHP's may be either transmissive or reflective. In a transmissive OHP, the light source is under the stage area, i.e., opposite the side of the projector head. In a reflective OHP, the light source is above the stage area, typically near or even in the projector head, and the stage has a mirror-like surface to reflect the light back toward the head.Use of OHP's has recently expanded from the traditional projection of images printed on transparent films, to the projection of images which are stored in machine-readable form (e.g., on magnetic or optical disks) and which are presented by means of a light- trans issive liquid crystal display (LCD) panel which is laid on the stage of the OHP. Exemplary LCD/OHP arrangements are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,846,694 and 4,944,578. In these patents, the LCD panels are controlled by external processors, such as a personal computer (PC) . This type of system enhances the use of an OHP since the LCD controller may simultaneously direct the video output to other viewing devices, such as 

television monitors, which may be placed at several stations among the audience.Several problems have arisen, however, in the use of LCD panels with OHP's. Foremost among these is the difficulty of storing and transporting the PC which controls the LCD panel, and connecting the PC to the panel. Three alternative systems have been devised to overcome this problem. The first system simply provides a portable "black box," much more compact than a normal PC and having simplified user inputs, which contains the minimum electronic components necessary to control the LCD panel, such as a microprocessor, memory storage and a monitor
