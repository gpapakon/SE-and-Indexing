<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic vehicle tyre with a thread profile which has in the central region at least one wide, circumferential groove (1) which extends in particular in a straight line and into which lateral channels (2) which are spaced from one another in the circumferential direction open. Lateral channels which end at a distance from the edge of the thread are arranged at least in that profile area which is assigned to the outside of the vehicle when the tyre is mounted on the vehicle, the said edge of the thread extending within an at least essentially unprofiled profile zone.

<CLAIMS>
Pneumatic vehicle tyre having a tread surface 
profile which includes in the central region at least 

one wide circumerential groove, which especially extends 
in a rectilinear manner and in which lateral notches 

terminate, said lateral notches being spaced apart from 
one another when viewed with respect to the 

circumferential direction, characterised in that lateral 
notches (2, 2
I
, 2
III
, 2
IV
) are disposed at least in that 
profile region which is associated with the outside of 

the vehicle when the tyre is assembled on the vehicle, 
and said notches end at a spacing in front of the tread 

strip ends, this tread strip edge extending internally 
of a profile zone which is at least substantially 

unprofiled. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the circumferential groove (1, 1
I
, 1
II
, 1
III
, 
1
IV
), which extends in the central region of the tread 
strip, has a width which is up to 25 mm, lateral notches 

(2, 2
I
, 2
III
, 2
IV
) terminating in this circumferential 
groove from both sides and, more especially, all of the 

lateral notches ending at a spacing in front of the 
tread strip edges. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that at least the lateral notches (2, 

2
I
, 2
II
, 2
IV
), which extend in the external profile 
region, are configured in such a manner that their 

width continuously becomes greater, more especially 
towards the wide circumferential groove (1, 1
I
, 1
II
, 
1
IV
). 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the spacing between the lateral  

 
notches (2, 2
I
, 2
II
, 2
III
, 2
IV
) and the respective tread 
strip edge is between 5 and 30 %, more especially 

between 5 and 15 % of the width of the ground engaging 
surface. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a narrow circumferential groove 

(4
I
), having a width of between 1 and 5 mm, is disposed 
between the ends of the lateral notches (2, 2
I
, 2
II
, 
2
III
, 2
IV
) and the associated tread strip edge, the 
spacing between said groove and the associated tread 

strip edge being between 2 and 20 %, more especially 
between 2 and 10 % of the width in the ground engaging 

surface. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that fine incisions (6), having a width 

of less than 1 mm, are disposed in the profile zone, 
which includes the tread strip edge and is at least 

substantially unprofiled, and extend at least 
substantially in the transverse direction of the 

profile. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the lateral notches (2, 2
I
, 2
II
, 
2
III
, 2
IV
) form substantially a V, or respectively an 
arrow, in respect of the direction of rotation of the 

tyre, the closed end regions of the lateral notches (2, 
2
I
, 2
II
, 2
III
, 2
IV
) preferably coming into contact 
initially with the underlying ground during the rolling 

movement of the tyre. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the lateral notches (2
IV
), which  
 

extend towards the external shoulder, are configured as 

grooves which become wider towards the centre of the 
tread surface, the grooves (8) extending towards the 

internal shoulders and either having a constant width or 
becoming wider towards the internal shoulder and 

extending more especially beyond the tread strip edge in 
the internal shoulder region. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the tread strip profile has an 

asymmetrical configuration in respect of the centre 
line, at least one additional rectilinearly extending 

circumferential groove (7) being provided in the profile 
region, which is orientated towards the internal 

shoulder, and intersecting the lateral notches (2
II
) 
extending there. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that grooves (10), which extend 

substantially in the axial direction, are disposed in at 
least one shoulder region, externally of the tread strip 

width (B).
