<ABSTRACT>
A reprogrammable electronic responder card, comprising a 
support provided with an electronic circuit in which information 

can be stored and from which the stored information can be read 
out. 
The support is, at least partly, provided with a thin film 
of liquid crystalline polymeric material which, by means of a 

temperature treatment, can be brought locally and selectively 
into a first condition wherein the material is clear or into a 

second condition wherein the material is opaque. Further, 
controllable means are provided, capable of effecting a local 

temperature change of the thin film, in order to visually 
represent at least a part of the information stored in the 

electronic circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reprogrammable electronic 
responder card, comprising a support provided with an electronic 
circuit in which information can be stored and from which the 
stored information can be read out. An electronic responder card, sometimes referred to as chip 
card, comprises an integrated electronic circuit in which 
information can be stored which can be read out automatically, 
preferably in contactless manner, by means of a suitable device. 
In reprogrammable form, such a card is sometimes referred to as 
smart card. If so desired, the card may comprise a magnetic 
strip. Applications of such a chip card, which may or may not be 
contactless, include its use as an identification and/or 
admission card, for instance for use in public transport in 
buses, trams, the underground and trains, etc., as an admission 
card in skiing areas, as an admission card for soccer matches or 
in amusement parks, as a telephone card, etc. Smart cards as described in the standard ISO 7816, or the 
contactless version thereof according to the standard ISO 10536, 
comprise an integrated electronic circuit and are reprogrammable. 
They are used as credit cards and also as debit cards. Because, 
relatively speaking, they have a rather long life and are little 
subject to wear, it is attractive, also in view of the price of 
such cards, to be able to use them again. Such reuse can for 
instance be effected by "revaluating" the card, but it is also 
possible to issue the card to different successive users within a 
particular environment of use. If the card is used as debit card, 
for instance as a telephone card, it is important for the user to 
be able to read the residual value of a card on the card itself 
with the naked eye, without having to go to a telephone booth for 
that purpose. The same applies to other applications, such as for 
instance the Dutch national 'strip' card for public transport.  It is also desirable to provide the possibility of 
"revaluating" the cards, so that they can be reused. In that 
case, too, the residual value of the card which can be read with 
the human eye must be provided again. In card systems where one 
and the same card can be issued to several users in the course of 
time, it is necessary that, in addition to the residual value, 
also information with regard to the validity and the identity of 
the user be provided in a form readable by the user. Accordingly, 
it must be possible to erase this information and to provide it 
again. Since the cost price of such a
