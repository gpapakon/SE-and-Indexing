<ABSTRACT>
A process for making conventional and low-unsaturation polyether polyols wherein 
during the polymerization a portion of the liquid or vapor phase is continuously or 

periodically removed from the polymerization reactor and treated to remove allyl alcohol 
and lower allyl alcohol propoxylates. Propylene oxide or propylene oxide and polyether 

polyol in the removed portion is returned to the reactor. The process can be performed at 
high temperatures and/or low catalyst concentrations. Polyether polyols with exceptionally 

low monol contents can be prepared.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polyether polyol synthesis. In
particular, the invention is an exceptionally productive process
for making conventional and low-unsaturation polyether polyols
with conventional base catalysts. The key to the process is the
discovery that allyl alcohol and lower allyl alcohol propoxylates
can be effectively and continuously removed from the reaction
mixture during epoxide polymerization.Polyether polyols, useful intermediates for the production of
polyurethanes, are manufactured commercially by polymerizing
propylene oxide in the presence of hydroxyl or amino group-containing
initiators and basic catalysts. While the nominal
functionality of the polyol product is that of the initiator, the
average hydroxyl functionality is actually less than the nominal
functionality. The lower actual functionality results because
some of the propylene oxide isomerizes to allyl alcohol under the
basic reaction conditions, and the allyl alcohol is propoxylated
to give a polyether monol impurity. Polyether monol impurities,
which are estimated by measuring polyol unsaturation, are
preferably minimized because they adversely impact polyurethane
physical properties. The isomerization side reaction limits the conventional
polyether polyol synthesis in two important ways. First, the
reaction must be performed at temperatures within the range of
about 95-120°C to achieve acceptable reaction rates and to
minimize propylene oxide isomerization. At higher temperatures,
polymerization rates are faster and batch times are shorter, but
the isomerization reaction rate also increases so that the the
unsaturation level of the polyol exceeds acceptable limits. At
lower batch temperatures, the batch times are measured in days
and weeks instead of hours. Thus, productivity is limited
because higher reaction temperatures cannot be used without
sacrificing polyol quality. Second, polyols having equivalent
weights greater than about 2,000 cannot generally be made using
conventional base catalysts without generating excessively high
levels of monol impurities.Previous approaches to preparing polyether polyols that
contain reduced levels of polyether monol impurities have focused
on preparing polyols at lower temperatures with conventional
catalysts, or have used special catalysts such as double metal
cyanide compounds. Because low-unsaturation polyols can give
improved polyurethanes, synthetic routes to the polyols are of
interest.Propenyl unsaturation is preferred over allylic unsaturation
because propenyl groups are
