fusion protein, which vector comprises a recombinant 

monospecific single chain cassette comprising a DNA sequence 
encoding a first binding domain capable of binding a cell 

surface antigen. 
In another embodiment the expression vector encodes a 
bispecific fusion protein, which vector comprises a 

recombinant bispecific single chain cassette comprising a DNA 
sequence encoding a first binding domain capable of binding a 

cell surface antigen and a DNA sequence encoding a second 
binding domain capable of binding a cell surface antigen, each 

domain capable of binding a different antigen. 
The present invention also provides a method for producing a 
biologically active monospecific or bispecific fusion protein 

in a mammalian cell. This method comprises: (a) transfecting 
the mammalian cell with the recombinant expression vector of 

the invention; (b) culturing the mammalian cell so transfected 
in step (a); and (c) recovering the biologically active 

bispecific fusion protein so as produced by the cultured 
mammalian cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to expression vectors encoding
bispecific fusion proteins and methods for producing a
biologically active bispecific fusion protein in a mammalian
cell.Because of the problems associated with traditional antibody
technology such as obtaining antibody from sera or hybridoma
technology, genetic engineering has been used with increasing
frequency to design, manipulate, and produce antibodies or
antibody derivative molecules (such as bispecific fusion
proteins) with a desired set of binding properties and
effector functions.Difficulties encountered with the production of stable
hybridomas producing human antibody have led to the
development of alternative technologies designed to circumvent
invivo antibody production and conventional invitro
techniques (Mayforth R.D., Quintans, J. (1990) Current
Concepts: Designer and catalytic antibodies. New Eng. J. Med.

Morrison, S.L. (1992) In Vitro antibodies: strategies for
production and application. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 10:239-266).Initial attempts to couple the binding specificities of two
whole antibodies against different target antigens for
therapeutic purposes utilized chemically conjugated
"heteroconjugate" molecules (Staerz, U.D., Kanagawa, O.,
Bevan, M.J. (1985) Hybrid antibodies can target sites for
attack by T cells. Nature 314:628-631; Perez, P., Hoffman,
