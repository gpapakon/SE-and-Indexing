<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control for the operation of a 
beverage dispenser of the refrigerated ice bank type (50) is 

shown. The control provides for reliable determinations 
of when ice production is needed and when it is not 

needed. A microprocessor (140) receives information from an 
ice bank probe (70) and from a temperature probe (72) located 

within the ice bank (53). Data collected by the 
microprocessor (140) from both the ice bank probe (70) and the 

temperature probe (72) is used to determine if the ice bank is 
either insufficient in size and should be increased or 

is of sufficient size such that the compressor (61) can be 
turned off. A carbonator level probe (38) is also shown and 

connected to the microprocessor (140). The microprocessor is 
programmed whereby the carbonator probes are sampled in a 

manner to accurately determine the level of water in the 
carbonator (10) and therefore the need for turning on or 

turning off any water pump (59) connected thereto. Both the 
operation of the compressor (61) and the water pump (59) are 

controlled by the microprocessor (140) wherein the programming 
thereof provides for adequate hysteresis protection so 

that short cycling of the compressor and water pump is 
avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to beverage 
dispensers and in particular electronically controlled 
beverage dispensers of the ice bank type. Beverage dispensers are well known in the art and 
are typically used to dispense carbonated beverages 
consisting of a combination of syrup and carbonated 
water. Beverage dispensers of the ice bank variety use 
refrigeration equipment including a compressor, condenser 
and evaporator to form an ice bank around the evaporator 
coils. The ice bank is suspended in a tank of cold water 
and provides a cooling reserve for the carbonated water 
and syrup beverage constituents. A major problem with ice banks concerns the 
regulation of the size thereof. Mechanical and 
electro-mechanical controls are known. However, such 
controls can be slow to respond and therefore result in 
wider than desired fluctuation in the size of the ice 
bank. Electronic controls are known whereby a pair of 
probes determine the presence of ice or water as a 
function of the conductivity thereof. However, early 
electronic controls suffered from reliability problems, 
and the probes over time can become corroded and 
therefore provide unreliable information. Furthermore, 
both mechanical and electronic controls have the problem 
of hysteresis management wherein undesirable short 
cycling of the refrigeration compressor can occur. Such 
prior art controls have not been able to determine with a 
high degree of certainty whether ice is present, and if 
so is there is sufficient thickness that further ice 
production should be terminated. A similar problem exists in prior art beverage  
 
dispensers with respect to the carbonator. The 
carbonator, of course, is the vessel wherein plain water 
and carbon dioxide are combined to produce the carbonated 
water. Typically, a carbonator includes a probe 
positioned therein having high and low probe contact 
points for electronically determining the level of water 
within the carbonator. Specifically, the probes 
determine the presence of water or air with respect to 
the difference in electrical resistance therebetween. 
Prior art level controls of this type, as with ice bank 
controls, suffer with the problem of accuracy. The 
interior of the carbonator is a dynamic environment where 
water and carbon dioxide are being combined causing 
turbulation and spray. Thus, it has always been 
difficult to know if the water is in fact sufficiently 
low to require water to be pumped to the carbonator. 
Since it is difficult to know the level of the water in 
the
