<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting a
deflated tyre on a vehicle suitable for cars,
trucks or the like.Prior applications such as French Patent
Publication FR-A-2568519 and European Patent
Publication EP-A-0 291 217 propose using wheel speed
signals from the vehicle wheels such as for example
the signals from an anti-lock braking system which
are multi-pulse signals of typically 48 to 96
pulses per revolution of each wheel. The prior art
system compares the speed derived signals in
various ways, and also attempts to overcome errors
due to vehicle factors such as cornering, braking,
accelerating, uneven or changing loads, which can
cause changes in the speed signals which are larger
than those caused by a tyre deflation of for
example 0.4 bar.French Patent Publication FR-A-2568519 avoided errors of
this type by monitoring the speeds of the
diagonally opposed pairs of wheels for a long time 
or distance period so that it averaged out
effectively cornering of the vehicle. The result
however was that the device operated very slowly
taking many Kilometres to sense a pressure loss.European Patent Publication EP-A-0 291 217 improved the
situation by calculating the lateral and
longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle using the
same four wheel speed signals and setting fixed
limits above which the detection system was
inhibited to avoid false signals due to cornering
and acceleration. This inhibition of detection
however meant that for a proportion of the time of
vehicle running the system was not sensing
punctures, the actual proportion depending upon the
type of roads and the way the vehicle was being
driven.The real difficulty with these types of systems is
that, apart from the lateral acceleration of the
vehicle which occurs during cornering causing
increased deflection of the outer pair of wheels
compared to the inner pair of wheels, each vehicle
has different characteristics due to the position 
of the centre of gravity and the type of suspension
and these different characteristics when cornering
produce additional deflections in the outer pairs
of tyres with regard to the inner pairs of tyres.However the vehicle characteristics make the tyre
deflections different in each of the tyres.
Similar problems occur due to vehicle
characteristics in the deflections in the front
pair of tyres compared to the rear pair when the
vehicle brakes, and vice- versa when the vehicle
accelerates.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a method of detecting a deflated tyre on a vehicle
which
