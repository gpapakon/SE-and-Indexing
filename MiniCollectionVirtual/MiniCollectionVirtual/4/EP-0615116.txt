<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring the temperature of 
polyurethane foam comprises a needle-shaped temperature 

measuring means positioned in the vicinity of a central 

portion of the polyurethane foam, a transmitter for 
transmitting an output signal of measured temperature data, 

a receiver for receiving the output signal, and a recorder 
for recording the received data. This apparatus can 

arbitrarily effect the setting of a temperature monitoring 
room and can measure the temperature of polyurethane foam in 

highly safe working conditions, simply and efficiently. A 
method for maturing polyurethane foam is constructed in 

that: after polyurethane foam is foamed, a temperature 
measuring sensor having a transmitter is inserted into a 

vicinity of a central portion of the polyurethane foam; in a 
maturing room, the polyurethane foam is matured while 

continuously measuring the temperature of the polyurethane 
foam; it is determined that a point in time, in which the 

temperature begins to fall, is the end of the maturing time 
period; thereafter, the temperature measuring sensor is 

taken out of the polyurethane foam. This method makes it 
possible to effect a maturing process of polyurethane foam 

in highly safe and efficient manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
measuring the temperature of polyurethane foam, which is 
suitable for use in a process for maturing the polyurethane 
foam, and a method for maturing the polyurethane foam. Polyurethane foam, particularly soft polyurethane foam, 
is generally formed by using polyole, polyisocyanate, water 
and the like as the raw materials so that a foam body is 
formed by a carbonic acid gas generated during the reaction 
of these raw materials. The reaction causes a generation of 
heat. Normally, the heat from the reaction is cooled 
naturally. However, since certain physical characteristics 
are required for polyurethane foam, such as hardness, there 
exist drawbacks in that when the amount of water in the raw 
materials is excessively increased so that the amount of 
generated heat increases, the heat from the reaction is 
accumulated by the effect of heat insulation of the 
polyurethane foam itself so as to cause discoloration of the  
 
polyurethane foam, and according to circumstances, the 
internal portion of the foam body is decomposed by heat 
deterioration so that a cavity is formed therein. Further, 
there is a problem in that the polyurethane foam combusts 
when air intrudes into the internal portion of the 
polyurethane foam. Conventionally, in order to prevent accidents caused by 
heat deterioration, the amount of generated heat was 
controlled by strictly controlling the mixture of the 
compounding ingredients and controlling the amount of 
supplied raw materials. Further, an abnormal condition 
caused by the generation of heat was detected when the 
temperature of a sampling from each production lot was 
measured. Specifically, for the purpose of controlling the 
maximum temperature so as to preferably be equal to or less 
than 180 ° C, the following steps are given: (1) a 
polyurethane foam modifier such as a flame retardant is 
added to the polyurethane foam raw materials; (2) the kind 
of catalyst used is selected; (3) the ratio of water to the 
raw material polyole is set to be less than or equal to 6.0 
parts by weight of water to 100 parts by weight of polyole; 
and (4) when water exceeding 6.0 parts by weight is mixed 
in, an inert foaming agent such as freon, methyl chloride, 
or the like, is added so as to restrain the generation of 
heat.  In a process for maturing and storing polyurethane 
foam, measurement of the temperature was effected by an 
operator inserting a needle-shaped temperature sensor 
comprised of a thermocouple into a sample
