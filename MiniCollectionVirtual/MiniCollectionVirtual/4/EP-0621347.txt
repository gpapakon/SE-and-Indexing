<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve guide member
as one of component members of an internal combustion
engine, which is formed of an Fe-based sintered alloy
having excellent wear and abrasion resistance.It is well known that conventionally a great
many Fe-based sintered alloys have been used as valve
guide members in internal combustion engines.In recent years, internal combustion engines
have made remarkable progress in output and speed
characteristics so that they exhibit higher output and
higher speed performance, and accordingly component
members constituting the internal combustion engines
are used under severer conditions. These component
members include valve guide members for guiding inlet
valves and exhaust valves of the engine which are
slidably fitted in central bores formed in the valve
guide members for reciprocating motion. The valve guide
members undergo heavy wear and abrasion due to the
eliding contact between the central bores of the valve
guide members and the valves (valve stems). Therefore,
further improved wear and abrasion resistance is
required of the valve guide members. In actuality,
however, the conventional valve guide members formed of
Fe-based sintered alloys do not exhibit satisfactory
wear and abrasion resistance to cope with the wear and
abrasion due to the sliding 
contact.It is, therefore, the object of the invention to
provide a valve guide member for internal combustion
engines, which is formed of an Fe-based sintered alloy
having excellent wear and abrasion resistance.To attain the above object, the present
invention provides an Fe-based sintered alloy
consisting of (in weight percent) 1 to 4 % C, 1.5 to 6 % Cu, 0.1 to 0.8 % P, the
balance being Fe and inevitable
impurities. The alloy may further contain 0.05 to 1 % wt
Mo, if required. The Fe-based sintered alloy has a
structure having a matrix formed mainly of pearlite, in
which are dispersed hard Fe-C-P compounds and free
graphite, or alternatively hard Fe-C-P compounds,
carbides and free graphite when the alloy contains Mo.
The free graphite includes 0.5 to 10 area % coarse free
graphite having a particle diameter of 70 to 500 µm.The above and other objects, features, and
advantages of the invention will become more apparent
from the following detailed description.Under the above stated circumstances, the
present inventors have made many studies in order to
obtain a valve guide member formed of an Fe-based
sintered alloy which exhibits excellent wear and
abrasion resistance under severe conditions, and
reached the
