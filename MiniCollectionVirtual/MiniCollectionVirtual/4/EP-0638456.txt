<ABSTRACT>
Sliding lining (6, 6') on pantograph horns (5, 5') of bow contacts (1) for current collectors of electrically operated vehicles, which sliding lining (6, 6') is attached to the upper side of a carrier component, serving as supporting surface (7, 7') for the sliding lining (6, 6'), of the pantograph horn (5, 5'). The sliding lining (6, 6') consists of longitudinal profiles (13) which are arranged parallel to one another and in the longitudinal direction of the pantograph horn (5, 5'), and are preferably metallic, and made of a filler-like, slidable artificial resin compound (14, 14') which fills the intermediate spaces between the profiles (13) and if appropriate covers the profiles (13). The profiles (13) and the filler-like artificial resin compound (14, 14') are permanently attached to the supporting surface (7, 7') of the pantograph horn (5, 5') by mechanical anchoring and/or by bonding. The sliding lining (6, 6') is better protected against the stresses which occur during operation by the chamber-like design consisting of various materials and the by the fact that the attachment function is shared between a plurality of elements and zones.
