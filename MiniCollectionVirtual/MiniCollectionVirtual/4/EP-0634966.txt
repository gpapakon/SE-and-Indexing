<ABSTRACT>
Described is an apparatus (1) for making concrete construction elements (100) having hollow channels (104) extending in the longitudinal direction thereof. Such an apparatus (1) comprises a first concrete-pouring element (20) for making a bottom layer (110) for the construction element (100) to be made; vibrator shoes (31) for compacting the concrete of the bottom layer (110); a second concrete-pouring element (40) for pouring a second concrete layer (120) onto the bottom layer (110); a vibrator plate (51) for compacting the concrete of the second layer (120); and bars or pipes (61) extending from the vibrator shoes (31) to beyond the vibrator plate (51) for ensuring that the hollow channels (104) are made in the constuction element (100) to be made. According to the invention, this apparatus (1) is improved in that between the vibrator shoes (31) and the bars or pipes (61) there is arranged a flexible filling piece (200) having a gradually extending contour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for making concrete 
construction elements having hollow channels extending in the 
longitudinal direction of these construction elements. Apparatuses for making such concrete construction 
elements are known in practice. An example thereof is 
described in US-A-3,177,552. The known apparatuses are 
intended for making the concrete construction elements in 
great lengths, with the concrete construction elements lying 
still on a work floor and the apparatus moving over the work 
floor to make the concrete construction element in two cycles 
of operations. To that end, the apparatus has a first 
concrete-pouring element for applying a bottom layer of the 
concrete construction element, means for compacting the 
concrete of the bottom layer, a second concrete-pouring 
element for pouring a second concrete layer onto the bottom 
layer, means for compacting the second layer as well, and 
means for ensuring that the hollow channels are made in the 
concrete construction element. The first compacting element is a vibrator element having 
vibrator shoes which, on the lower side thereof, have a 
contour that corresponds to the contour of the lower side of 
the channels to be formed. The vibration causes the 
thixotropic concrete mass to become fluid, so that it compacts 
and the lower side of the channels to be formed is formed. The 
elements serving to give the channels their final form consist 
of bars or pipes having a contour that corresponds to the 
contour of the channels to be formed, which pipes extend from 
the first vibrator elements to beyond the second concrete-pouring 
element and the second vibrator element. During 
pouring the second concrete layer onto the first layer, the 
pipes ensure that the concrete can only reach the channel 
walls between the channels, with the help of the second 
vibrator element which renders the concrete fluid, so that it 
also compacts. In this connection, the second vibrator element 
has a flat lower side, i.e. a lower side whose shape  
 
corresponds to the shape of the upper side of the concrete 
construction element to be formed. The pipes or bars move with the apparatus and can in 
principle be held still relative to the apparatus, thus having 
a uniform speed relative to the concrete mass formed, but in 
order to reduce friction of the pipes relative to the concrete 
mass, these pipes are given a vibrating motion in their 
longitudinal direction. This vibrating motion takes place at a 
frequency of, for instance,
