<ABSTRACT>
Starting from an agricultural machine at least with a device for gathering reaped crops deposited especially in a swath, preferably stalk crops, the device having multi-part gathering members (11, 12, 13), and the gathering members (11, 12, 13), each arranged on the end face of the device, including a worm (16), being designed pivotably, the object of the invention, to ensure that the gathering process proceeds as efficiently as possible and independently of the prevailing ground conditions and to guarantee that more than one swath or loosely deposited crops are gathered, is achieved in that at least the gathering members (11, 12, 13) arranged on the end face are assigned a device for detecting the ground conditions and a pivoting of the individual gathering members (11, 12, 13) takes place in dependence on the detected ground conditions.

<CLAIMS>
An agricultural machine with at least one device (1) for gathering in reaped
crop to be harvested, preferably crop with a stem, especially that laid in a

windrow, wherein the device (1) has take-up units (11, 12, 13) comprising

a plurality of parts and a screw conveyor (16) associated thereto, and the
take-up units (11, 12, 13) arranged on the ends of the device (1) can be

swivelled, wherein a device (17) for the capture of ground conditions is
associated at least to the take-up units (11, 12, 13) arranged at the ends
characterised in that
 the agricultural machine is arranged such that the
individual take-up units (11, 12, 13) are swivelled independently of one

another as a function of captured ground conditions.
An agricultural machine according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
device (1) for gathering in crop has at least one assembly, especially a

further assembly for adjustment of a pre-determinable height of the device
(1) above the ground.
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the take-up units (11, 12, 13) or the screw conveyor
(17) have a drive unit (15) and the drive (15) is dependent on the travel speed

of the agricultural machine.
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the drive (15) is dependent on the processing speed of
the assemblies arranged downstream of the device for gathering-in crop (1).
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the device (1) has a take-up table (10) which comprises
a plurality of parts, with some parts capable of undergoing swivel movement 

in height as a function of the captured ground conditions.
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 at least the take-up units (11, 12, 13) are swivellable
in height parallel to the ground surface as a function of the captured ground

conditions.
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 at least one take-up unit (11, 12, 13) is arranged as a
pick-up which is in the form of a belt.
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 means are arranged over at least part of the belt and
support take-up of the crop to be harvested.
An agricultural machine according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the belt extends substantially over the entire width of
the device (1) and is stretchable in the swivel region (in the region of the

articulations (14)).
