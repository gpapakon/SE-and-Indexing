<ABSTRACT>
The invention manufactures mechanical strong objects from a 
mixture of a plurality of fractions, which together have a 

high filling grade by accommodating them in plastic, 
preferably a thermosetter of the low viscosity type. The 

plastic is preferably resistant against leaching as 
defined in the Concept Bouwstoffenbesluit, when pollutions 

in the fractions are present. Finally the invention gives 
objects with good mechanical properties at low cost price, 

because of the relatively small use of plastic (to only 8 
volume % or less) and the favourable mechanical properties 

of strongly densified waste, residual or filler materials. 
Colouring of the objects is possible and the surface can be 

very smooth. Fibres or residues of fibres containing waste 
materials can improve the obtained products still further.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for working up of waste 
materials and structural parts obtained therewith. The term waste material in fact indicates an in itself 
undesired product that has no direct useful application. 
Once such an application has been found the same material 
can be called a raw material. In practice, by waste material is meant a material, which 
in its present state has no useful application and/or 
requires additional payment, sometimes in the form of 
transport free of charge, when being transferred. Examples 
of such waste materials are debris and materials derived 
therefrom such as refract sand, demolish sand and wash 
silt; glass; used plastic material that is not, or only 
after labour intensive selection, suitable to be used; 
fibres of natural or artificial materials and even of 
asbestos, moulding sand; silt or sludge, such as paper 
sludge, sludge from purification of waste water or 
preparation of drinking-water and used steal grit, often 
together with the material removed by grit blasting that 
for example may contain dyeing materials. The working up of such waste materials, such as demolition 
debris in practice often leads to difficulties, especially 
of certain components can be worked up and others not. 
Moreover many waste materials in principal have a good 
mechanical quality and therefore can be used for 
technically and economically highly valuable structural 
parts. Herewith it is pointed to it that waste material of 
have a negative "buying price". A further difficulty with working up of waste materials is, 
that they often contain demolitions, which on base of the 
Concept Bouwstoffenbesluit (Dutch environmental rules with 
respect to secondary building materials) prevent allowance 
to bring them in immediate contact with soil or use them as  
 
building materials. When working up demolition debris it is often allowed to 
use important quantities thereof in contact with the soil 
and/or ground water. These are the so-called residual 
materials, to which the Law about waste materials does not 
apply. However, there may be demolition debris, fractions 
of which contain so much pollution that for instance for 
dumping expensive precautions are necessary to counter 
leaching of the pollutions. Such fractions, possibly coming 
from or existing in polluted materials, as for instance 
occur in chimneys, in the following will be called residues 
of waste materials. Further in the invention so-called 
filler materials may find application, which consist in 
unpollu
