<ABSTRACT>
A dongle comprises means in the form of for example circuitry which is adapted to be able to change the information contained in a particular memory location in a predetermined manner. Software to be protected will not run unless it identifies a predetermined pattern in a particular memory location. The memory location may be either real or virtual.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A DONGLEThis invention relates to a method for preventing use of unauthorised copies of software and to a protected recording medium, unauthorised copies of which are rendered useless.The invention also provides a communication link between any device using a memory, whether physical or virtual, and also provides security for such a device. The invention is thus useful for protecting software and also the confidentiality of certain data.The use of magnetic recording media such as diskettes to record computer programmes has become very widespread in recent years. Conventional diskettes are easily copied and this leads to the problem that unauthorised copies can be widely disseminated thus depriving the software copyright owner from his rightful fees or royalties.It has been proposed to prevent copying of information from diskettes by encoding on them instructions which normally prevent the writing of the contents of the diskette onto another disk or diskette. However, what can be protected by software can be changed by software and sophisticated copiers can circumvent such protection.Another approach to software protection is the use of some sort of circuitry plugged into one of the computer ports and having a communication between itself and the software thereby providing security for the software since the latter could not be activated without communicating with this circuit. The latter is known as a "Dongle". However, the use of a conventional dongle is not generally favoured especially because it is inconvenient for the user who must place the required circuitry into a computer port or bus slot. Moreover, where several different types of software are employed each needing a different dongle, the computer user may need to change dongles between programmes which could well cause him to use other proprietary brands of software not employing this form of protection.In addition, such devices are never transparent and may 

therefore cause problems when it is required to interface other devices such as printers, modems etc with the computer.The invention seeks to provide an improved form of dongle for use in protecting computer software and data.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a device comprising means for changing information at a particular memory location forming part of a computer system.The device may be a dongle.The memory may be either real or virtual.The dongle according to the invention may comprise circuitry in the form of electronics which circuitry may be built
