<ABSTRACT>
The device serves for detecting disturbances and for indicating disturbances on signal lines in motor vehicles. A separately arranged sensor (10) of the device is fed with a special supply current (15'). The sensor output signal (16') has to fulfil different requirements relating to frequency and amplitude in order to be able to be accepted as valid. For this purpose, a specific circuit (12) within the sensor is used, this said circuit (12) cooperating with a corresponding pattern detection circuit (23) of a combined supply/reception unit (21, 22, 23).

<CLAIMS>
Device for verifying disturbances of the signal
transmission in motor vehicles, in particular in the signal

transmission between a distance-measuring instrument and
its associated measurement-signal transmitter (10) arranged

at a distance from the latter, the distance-measuring
instrument having a supplying and receiving unit (20) for

the measurement-signal transmitter (10), which is connected
to the supplying and receiving unit (20) via a

supply/reference voltage line (15'), to a signal feedback
line (16') and to a reference-potential conductor (17'),

characterized in that the supplying and receiving unit (20)
has a mixing stage (21) for generating an a.c. voltage

supply signal for the measurement-signal transmitter (10)
and a pattern-evaluating circuit (23), the pattern-evaluating

circuit (23) generating a logically active
output signal as soon as a signal derived from the signal

feedback line (16') has a substantially equal amplitude and
a substantially equal phase difference in comparison with

a synchronization signal.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
pattern-evaluating circuit (23) has two comparators (64,

74) for detecting variable voltage levels of approximately
equal magnitude.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
pattern-evaluating circuit (23) has a stage for checking

the phase position of a signal.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
mixing stage (21) generates a combined supply and reference

voltage, the a.c. voltage component of which is
approximately sinusoidal.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
phase difference has a constant value of about 170° - 190°.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
frequency of an oscillator (22) associated with the

supplying and receiving unit (20) is at least twice as high
as the frequency of the measurement-signal transmitter

(10).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
frequency of the oscillator (22) is altered or modulated as

a function of time.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
measurement-signal transmitter (10) includes, besides a

modulation stage (12), a voltage regulator (13), an a.c.
voltage filter (14) and a magnetic field sensor in the form

of a Hall IC (11).
