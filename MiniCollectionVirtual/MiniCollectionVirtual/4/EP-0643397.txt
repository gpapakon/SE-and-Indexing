<ABSTRACT>
Compositions are disclosed comprising electrically 
conducting polyaniline and particular substituted compounds 

that simultaneously form hydrogen bonds and ring-ring 
interactions with, respectively, the NH-groups and the six-membered 

rings of the conducting polyanilines. The present 
conducting polyaniline compositions show drastically 

enhanced processibility and their blends with insulating or 
semiconducting materials exhibit significantly improved 

electrical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to conducting
polymers, and more particularly relates to electrically
conductive compositions and shaped articles, such as parts,
containers, fibers, tapes, films, coatings and the like,
from polyanilines and blends thereof; and to the use of the
same compositions and conductive articles. More
specifically, this invention relates to liquid-phase
processable, electrically conducting polyaniline
compositions comprising particular substituted aromatic and
alicyclic compounds that simultaneously form hydrogen bonds
and ring-ring interactions with, respectively, the NH-groups
and the six-membered rings of the conducting polyanilines.
The present conducting polyaniline compositions show
drastically enhanced processibility and their blends with
insulating or semiconducting materials exhibit significantly
improved electrical properties.Electrically conductive, thermoplastic polymer
compounds are of increased practical interest, for instance,
for packaging electronic instruments and parts, and to solve
a wide range of static discharge, electrostatic dissipation
and electromagnetic shielding problems. Often, such 
compounds are made by mixing solid conductive particles such
as carbon black, stainless steel fibers, silver or aluminum
flakes or Nickel-coated fibers with insulating bulk
thermoplastics, for example polystyrene, polyolefins,
nylons, polycarbonate, acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene copolymers
(ABS), and the like. These filled compounds are
subsequently processed into desired shapes and articles by
common plastics processing methods such as extrusion,
injection molding and the like. Major problems related to
the above, so-called "filled" thermoplastic compounds are
that processing of these materials is not trivial and is
often associated with excessive machine wear; and the final
compounds frequently exhibit undesirable mechanical
properties such as brittleness and a reduced elongation to
break in comparison with the corresponding properties of the
unfilled matrix polymer.More recently, there has been an increased
interest in replacing such carbon black or metal particle-filled
compounds with intrinsically electrically conductive
polymers and their blends with common insulating polymers.
The latter systems are believed to be more cost competitive,
easier to process and to exhibit desirable mechanical
properties. Among the various conductive polymers, the
polyanilines in particular have attracted special attention
because of their excellent environmental stability and
