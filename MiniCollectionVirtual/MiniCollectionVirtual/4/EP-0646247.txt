<CLAIMS>
A terminal for connecting live conductors, comprising at least two
terminal components (9) for the electrical conductors and a

connecting piece (4) electrically interconnecting the terminal
components (9), characterised in that the terminal has one or

more magnetic field sensors (2) at a predetermined distance from
the connecting piece (4) which produces the electrical

connection between the terminal components (9).
A terminal according to claim 1, characterised in that one or more
insulators (11) are arranged between the connecting piece (4)

and the magnetic field sensor (2).
A terminal according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
insulators (11) interconnect the magnetic field sensors (2) and the

connecting piece (4).
A terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that an evaluation circuit (3) is provided in the terminal in addition

to the magnetic field sensor (2).
A terminal according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in
that a hybrid circuit (1) is arranged on the insulator (11). 
A terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the terminal is formed as a standard terminal.
A terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the terminal has a base (17) with connecting means for

fastening to a rail, in particular a top-hat rail.
A terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the connecting piece (4) has a predetermined defined

resistance.
A housing for holding a plurality of terminals, characterised in that
the terminals are formed according to any one of claims 1 to 8.
A housing according to claim 9, characterised in that the
connecting pieces of the terminals have different resistances.
