<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amidothiophosphate
derivative, and an insecticide, a
nematocide and an acaricide containing the amidothiophosphate
derivative as an active ingredient.Several amidothiophosphate derivatives are
known to have activities for controlling noxious
insects, nematodes and mites. For example, JAPANESE
PATENT KOKAI NO. 59-108796 discloses an amidothiophosphate
derivative represented by the formula I:

wherein A represents a n-propyl group, an isobutyl group
or a sec-butyl group; and R' represents a methyl group
or an ethyl group.The amidothiophosphate derivative of the
formula I, however, has rather high acute toxicity to
mammals and thereby cannot be practically used as an
active ingredient of insecticides, nematocides and
acaricides. To overcome the drawbacks of said compounds,
the inventors have conducted extensive studies and found
that the amidothiophosphate derivative (hereinafter
referred to as the present compound) of the formula II
shown below has excellent activities for controlling
noxious insects, nematodes and mites while having low
acute toxicity to mammals.Thus the present invention provides an
amidothiophosphate derivative represented by the formula
II:

wherein
R1 is a methyl group or an ethyl group;R2 is a n-propyl group or a sec-butyl group;R3 is a C1-C4 alkylthio group, a phenyl group, a C1-C4
alkoxy group or a phenoxy group; and n represents 1
or 2.The invention also provides an insecticide, a
nematocide and an acaricide containing the amidothiophosphate
derivative of the formula II as an active
ingredient, and a method of controlling insects,
nematodes or acarines which comprises applying the
compound II as an active ingredient to the locus where
pests propagate. The present compound exerts excellent
insecticidal, nematocidal and acaricidal activities
against noxious insects of Lepidoptera such as Chilosuppressalis
and Spodopteralitura, those of Diptera
such as Culexpipienspallens and Muscadomestica (house
fly), nematodes such as Meloidogyneincognita, and mites
such as Tetranychuscinnabarinus. The compound is
especially active against noxious insects and nematodes
in soil which damage a variety of agricultural products,
flowers and grass.Table 1 shows examples of the compound
(Substituents of the compound of the formula II are
listed.). The present compound is produced by the
following methods.
Method A:A method of producing the compound of the
formula II which comprises reacting a phosphoric acid
chloride of the formula III:
