<ABSTRACT>
A ball joint which comprises a housing (1) having a side 
wall and an open axial end, a ball seat member (5) fitted into 

the housing (1) and internally defining a cavity (7), a ball 
stud (2) having a spherical head (10) rotatably received in 

cavity (7) and a stem portion (11) extending out of the open 
end of the housing, and a dust cover (13) having a first end 

(14) fitted on the stem portion (11) of the ball stud (2) and 
a second end (15) secured to a peripheral part of the open end 

of the housing, in which the second end (15) of the dust cover 
(13) is held between an external flange (8) provided on the 

ball seat member (5) and an annular end surface (1a) of the 
open end of the housing. By virtue of this arrangement, the 

end of the dust cover is firmly clamped over its entire 
circumference between the external flange and the end surface 

of the housing so that a reliable clamping action can be 
produced. Also, because the securing process can be 

accomplished at the same time as the process of fitting the 
ball seat member into the housing without in any way 

complicating the assembly process, material and fabrication 
costs can be reduced, whereby an economical construction of 

ball joint can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ball joint, and 
in particular to a ball joint equipped with a dust 
cover. A number of ball joints have been conventionally 
known. For instance, Japanese examined utility model 
publication (kokoku) JP-Y2- 63-39452 discloses a ball 
joint equipped with a dust cover. According to this 
prior art, as illustrated in Figure 7, the ball joint 
comprises a housing 51 defining an inner chamber and 
having an open end, a ball seat member 53 fitted into 
the inner chamber of the housing 51, a ball stud 52 
having a spherical head disposed in a cavity defined in 
the ball seat member 53 and a stem portion connected to 
this spherical head and extending out of the open end 
of the housing 51, and a dust cover 54 extending 
between the housing 51 and the external surface of the 
stem portion of the ball stud 52. An annular recess 55 
is formed around the outer circumferential surface of 
the open end of the ball seat member 53, and an annular 
bead 56 provided on the peripheral edge of the 
associated end of the dust cover 54 is fitted into this 
annular recess 55. Furthermore, a thin walled open end 
portion 57 of the housing 51 is crimped onto the entire 
outer circumferential surface of the open end of the 
ball seat member 53 with the result that the ball seat 
member 53 is firmly secured in the housing 51 and the 
bead 56 of the dust cover 54 is firmly retained in the 
annular recess 55. According to this structure, one can obtain the 
advantage that the dust cover 54 can be secured without 
using any clips for securing purpose. However, because 
uniformly deforming the open end portion 57 of the  
 
housing 51 is highly difficult to accomplish, and excessive local 
deformations tend to occur, a high dimensional precision must be 
maintained. Furthermore, it is difficult to stabilize the 
securing force and the sealing capability. Various measures can 
be taken, but such measures will increase the fabrication cost. 
Thus, crimping for securing a dust cover has various 
shortcomings. A ball joint in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 is 
known from US-A- 5 044 811, whereby the second end of the 
dust cover is retained in a groove between the housing and the 
ball seat by a clip. In view of such problems of the prior art, a primary object 
of the present invention is to provide a ball joint equipped with 
a dust cover which can be fabricated both economically and 
simply. A second object of the present invention is to provide a 
ball joint equipped with a dust cover
