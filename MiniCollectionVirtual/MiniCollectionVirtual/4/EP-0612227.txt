<ABSTRACT>
A lancet device includes a body (242) within which is slidably located a trigger (224) and fixedly located a base. The base (214) contains, in an armed position, the lance (202) with its needle (204) and a spring affixed to the lance. The trigger includes means to release the lance during use. In preferred embodiment, the lancet device of the present invention is self-activated by the finger (or other body part) to be pierced. Depression of the trigger with the finger releases the lance and the spring so that the needle protrudes through an orifice in the end of trigger and pierces the tissues. Because the spring is held in a pre-armed position, release of the spring is consistent, and reproducibility of incision is well controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lancet
device for use in taking capillary blood samples
by pricking a body tissue, such as a fingertip.In the case of certain diseases, such as
diabetes, or test kits, such as cholesterol test
kits, a patient is required to provide small
specimens of blood for analysis. This involves
pricking a finger or other suitable body part in
order to obtain the blood specimen. It is
physiologically and psychologically difficult for
many people to prick their own finger with a hand-held
needle, which must be sterile.Other lancet devices for obtaining blood
samples, such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,869,249 and 4,817,603
(upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based),
include a cap which is used to
protect the needle or to keep the needle sterile. This
makes manufacturing of these devices more difficult and
costly, and makes the device harder to use.US-A-4 426 279 discloses a capillary blood sampling
device comprising longitudinal body having a finger
position area at one end and a longitudinal access
opening to receive spring operated lancet holder. The
release mechanism of D1 is rotationally actuated. US-A-4
426 279 requires the use of both hands in order to
actuate the device.US-A-5 026 388 discloses a single use puncture
device which has a spring that is armed during
manufacture of the device and which cannot be rearmed.
The puncture device is actuated by a user compressing an
area of the device through which the device extends for
piercing the skin of the user.In other devices, a spring used to shoot a needle
into the tissue is compressed during use by the trigger
mechanism, which can lead to misfiring or skewing of the
spring so that the incision made is not suitable for
obtaining a blood sample. Also, two hands are required
for operation of many of these devices. Thus, there is a need for a simple, inexpensive,
reliable, self-activating, disposable lancet device in
which reproducibility of suitable incisions is well
controlled.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an improved lancet device.
This object is solved by the lancet device of Claim 1.In one preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a
lancet device comprising a body within which is slidably
located a trigger and fixedly located base. The base
contains, in an armed position, a lance with its needle
and a spring affixed to the lance. The trigger includes
means to release the lance during use.In a further preferred embodiment, the lancet device of the
present invention is self-activated by
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lancet device (200) for piercing a body part comprising a
lance (202) carrying a needle (204), means for releasably

retaining said lance in an armed position, a trigger (224)
having a hollow centre, said trigger having an orificed end

(230) through which said needle is urged by a spring upon
release of said lance, a body (242) having a barrel to

longitudinally and slidably receive said trigger (224), said
body (242) having an orificed end through which said trigger

(224) is longitudinally actuable upon contact with the body
part to be pierced, said device being characterised by the

lance (202) having one or more arms (207), the trigger (224)
comprising one or more slots (236) to longitudinally and

slidably guide said one or more arms (207) of the lance (202)
when said lance is released from the armed position, and

means (220,236), responsive to longitudinal actuation of the
trigger, to release the lance from the armed position

comprising rotational means for translating movement along a
first central axis of the trigger into rotational movement

about said first axis to align said one or more slots (236)
with said one or more arms (207).
A lancet as claimed in claim 1, further comprising means for
engaging one end of the spring (208) with said base (214),

the other end being attached to said lance, optionally the
spring is fixedly attached to said base. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said lance
(202) carries a plurality of needles (204).
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said means
(238) for releasably retaining said lance (202)

comprises one or more pins (238) on said trigger
(224) which engage one or more angled slots (246) in

an outer surface of said body (242).
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
orificed end (230) of said trigger (224) has a

specific wall thickness and said needle or needles
(204) has or have a specific length which determines 

the depth of penetration thereof into said body
parts.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said

rotational means comprises one or more pins (238) on
said trigger (224) which engage one or more angled

slots (246) in an outer surface of said body (242)
such that the slots (246) cause the pins (238) and

the trigger (224) to rotate to align the slots (236)
with the one or more arms (207).
A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein said fixed
retention of said base (214) comprises moulding said

base (214) and said body (242) as a single piece.
A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein said means
for centring and guiding said trigger comprises one

or more pins (238) on said trigger (224) engaged
with one or more angled slots (246) in an outer

surface of said body (242).
A device as claimed in claim 2, wherein said base
(214), trigger (224) and body (242) are made of
