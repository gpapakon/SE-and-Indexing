<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for bushing cables through an opening (3) in a wall (2) of a housing. The wall (2) is preferably the rear wall of a switching cabinet. The invention is based on the object of creating a device which is suitable for bushing cables of different thicknesses. The object is achieved in that at least two layers of a compressible material (4) are provided, between which the cables (5) are pushed, and in that a holding device (6) is provided, by means of which pressure is exerted on the layers of the compressible material (4) and the cables (5) which run between it.
