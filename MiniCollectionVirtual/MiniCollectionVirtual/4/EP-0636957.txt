<ABSTRACT>
Partial programs, which are processed in numerical control systems, have high-level language instructions with symbolic identifiers, apart from normalised instructions for defined functions. These instructions must be programmed in accordance with a fixed syntax. So that syntax errors are recognised as soon as possible, but the partial programs are executed as quickly as possible, it is proposed according to the invention to translate the partial programs clause by clause into a binary intermediate language which is optimal for processing. The translation can be carried out off-line or on-line. The invention is used in numerically controlled machine tools.

<CLAIMS>
Method for processing programs of numerically 
controlled machine tools, which programs consist of 

motion records, having the following features: 

the program is input and edited in a high-level 
language or standardized language; 
the motion records are transposed individually 
from the high-level language or standardized language 

into records of a binary intermediate language; 
the records of the binary intermediate language 
are transposed into machine-language records; 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that first of all the whole of the motion records is 

translated into the records which form a binary 
intermediate language program, which records are then 

interpreted or transposed into the machine language. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the motion records are translated on-line and the 

machine is controlled with the records of the binary 
intermediate language.
