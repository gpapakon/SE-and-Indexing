<ABSTRACT>
An axial-flow separator device of a combine harvester contains a rotor housing and a rotor mounted rotatably in this, which are subdivided into threshing and separating portions (32) and (34). The rotor housing is closed on its top side by means of covers (53, 60) which are designed differently and which can be exchanged for those of other dimensions. By means of the size and shape of the covers (53, 60), it is possible to bring the rotor into an eccentric or a concentric position in relation to the rotor housing.

<CLAIMS>
An axial separating device (24) for processing harvested material, with a rotor 
housing (26) and a rotor (28) rotatably mounted therein and each extending through a 

threshing section (32) and a separating section (34), wherein the rotor housing (26) and 
the rotor (28) have an at least approximately concentric position relative to one another 

in the threshing section (32), characterized in that they have an eccentric position 
relative to one another in the separating section (34). 
An axial separating device according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
preferably lower region of the rotor housing (26) which allows material through is 

formed separately from a preferably upper region of the rotor housing (26) which can 
be closed by at least one cover (53, 60) and the cover (53, 60) is interchangeable, 

wherein covers (53, 60) of different forms can be selectively used, which lead to the 
eccentric or the at least approximately concentric position of the rotor housing (26) 

relative to the rotor (28). 
An axial separating device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a 
separator axis SA defining the middle of the rotor housing (26) in the separating 

section (34) runs parallel to and above the central rotor axis RA of the rotor (28). 
An axial separating device according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the covers (53, 60) are screwed on to rails (55, 57, 62), 

especially interchangeable rails.
