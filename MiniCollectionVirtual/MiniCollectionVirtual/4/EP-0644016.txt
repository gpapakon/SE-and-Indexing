<ABSTRACT>
A process of coating the internal surface of a 
hollow body (12) by depositing a coating (6) on a substrate (2) 

having an external surface similar to the internal 
surface of the hollow body; inserting the coated 

substrate to mate within and contact the internal 
surface of the hollow body (12); and then removing the 

substrate (2) while leaving the coating (6) secured to the 
internal surface of the hollow body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the coating of 
the internal surfaces of hollow bodies such as small 
diameter cylinders. In plasma spray coating technology, coatings are 
applied by injecting a powder into a plasma stream 
where they are heated, accelerated and then impinging 
the stream upon a surface, the point at which the 
stream impinges upon the surface or the impingement 
point, is moved over the surface, by moving the torch 
body and/or the object. In order to achieve an optimal 
coating, the angle of the axis of the plasma stream to 
the substrate surface at the moving impingement point 
should be maintained perpendicular. In addition, the 
standoff, the distance between the nozzle of the torch 
and the impingement point should be maintained 
substantially constant as the impingement point moves 
over the surface. An additional requirement for an 
optimal coating is that the impingement point move 
across the surface at a substantially constant rate. 
For simple surfaces of revolution, such as cylinders, 
conical sections, and annular surfaces, these 
requirements are met by merely rotating the object and 
moving the torch at a constant rate along a straight 
line. Flame plating by means of detonation using a 
detonating gun (D-Gun) has been used in industry to 
produce coatings of various compositions for over a 
quarter of a century. Basically, the detonation gun  
 
consists of a fluid-cooled barrel having a small inner 
diameter of about one inch. Generally a mixture of 
oxygen and acetylene is fed into the gun along with a 
comminuted coating material. The oxygen-acetylene fuel 
gas mixture is ignited to produce a detonation wave 
which travels down the barrel of the gun where it heats 
the coating material and propels the coating material 
out of the gun onto an article to be coated. U.S. Pat. 
No. 2,714,563 discloses a method and apparatus which 
utilizes detonation waves for flame coating. Using a 
detonation means with suitable coating materials can 
produce coatings having various characteristics, such 
as erosion resistant coatings, hard coatings and the 
like. Similar to plasma coating techniques, the 
detonation coating techniques require a barrel for the 
combustible gases and generally for optimal coating 
applications, the angle of the axis of the existing 
gases to the substrate surface should be maintained 
substantially perpendicular. For simple surfaces of 
revolution, this requirement is met by merely rotating 
the object and moving the barrel of the gun at a 
constant

A process for coating the internal surface of 
a hollow body comprising the steps: 


(a) preparing a hollow body for receiving on at 
least a portion of its internal surface a coating; 
(b) preparing a substrate having at least a 
portion of its external surface shaped to correspond to 

the internal surface of the hollow body to be coated; 
(c) depositing on at least a portion of the 
external surface of the substrate at least one layer of 

a coating to a desired thickness and composition; 
(d) inserting the coated substrate into the 
hollow body so that the coated surface of the substrate 

contacts the internal surface of the hollow body; and 
(e) removing the substrate from the hollow body 
while leaving the at least one layer of coating in 

contact with the internal surface of the hollow body 
thereby providing said hollow body with an internal 

coating. 
The process of claim 1 wherein in step (d) 
the hollow body is heated to expand the internal 

surface of said hollow body and then inserting the 
coated substrate into the hollow body while it is still 

heated. 
The process of claim 2 wherein the dimension 
of the external surface of the coated substrate is at 

least equal to the dimension of the internal surface of 
the hollow body to be coated. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the hollow 
body is a cylinder and the external surface of the 

substrate is a cylinder. 
The process of claim 4 wherein in step (d) 
the hollow body is heated to expand the hollow body and 

thereby expand the internal surface of said hollow body 
and then inserting the coated substrate into the hollow 

body while it is still heated. 
The process of claim 5 wherein the dimension 
of the external surface of the coated substrate is at 

least equal to the dimension of the internal surface of 
the hollow body to be coated. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the hollow 
body is made of a material selected from the group 

consisting of steel, nickel, cobalt, titanium, copper, 
aluminum and alloys thereof. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the substrate

iron, nickel, cobalt, titanium and alloys thereof, 

carbon-carbon composites, fiber reinforced composites 
and polymeric materials. 
The process of claim 1 wherein in step (c) 
the means for depositing the coating is selected from 

the group consisting of plasma spray means, detonation 
gun means, electrolytic means, electroless means, 

physical vapor deposition means, chemical vapor 
deposition means and high velocity oxy-f
uel means.
