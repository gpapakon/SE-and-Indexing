<ABSTRACT>
A dilution monitoring system for filter cigarettes 
comprises pairs of pressure sensors (114,120) 

provided individually for left- and right-hand manufactured 
filter cigarettes, a dilution processor card 

(62) adapted to receive pressure signals from the 
pressure sensors (114,120) through an A/D converter 

(61), and a server computer (39) connected to the processor 
card (62) by means of a communication line (38) 

and including a CRT. The dilution processor card (62) 
computes the respective dilutions of the individual 

filter cigarettes in accordance with the pressure 

signals, and stores the computation results into a RAM 
(68). Thereafter, the processor card (62) obtains 

quality informations, such as the average, frequency 
distribution, and standard deviation of the stored 

dilutions, for each group of the left- and right-hand 
filter cigarettes, also stores the quality informations 

into the RAM (68). The server computer (39) receives 
the quality informations transmitted from the 

processor card (62), and displays them in the form of 
a graph or table on the CRT.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for monitoring
dilutions of manufactured filter cigarettes.EP 0433800 A1 describes a method and an apparatus for
detecting micro-holes of examining the state of micro-holes
formed on each of rod-like matters. In this apparatus cigarettes having a
filtered section are successively carried to
a support section which is rotated, wherein each of the
cigarettes is supported between pads. The supported cigarette
is moved to a pre-pressurizing stage in which one end face of
the cigarette is closed and a pre-pressure is applied to the
other end face of the cigarette from a pre-pressure source.
The cigarette is reached to a measuring stage in which a
measuring pressure is applied to the other end face of the
cigarette so that air flows from micro-holes of the filter
section and a reduced pressure appears in the one end of the
cigarette. The measuring and reduced pressures are detected
by pressure transducers, and electrical signals from the
transducers are processed so that a dilution value of the
cigarette can be calculated.From GB 2259847 A, a filter cigarette manufacture machine
is known wherein double filter cigarettes may be packed or
subdivided to produce conventional cigarettes.In a machine for manufacturing filter cigarettes or a so-called
filter attachment, filter cigarettes are manufactured
by connecting filters to cigarettes which are fed from a
cigarette manufacturing machine. More specifically, the
filter attachment is provided with a cigarette transportation
path along which the cigarettes are transported in pairs.
Each pair of cigarettes are arranged in a line on the
transportation path, and are transported in a direction
perpendicular to the axis thereof. After a filter plug is 
supplied between each pair of cigarettes, in the process of
transporting the cigarettes, a paper piece is wound around the
cigarettes and the filter plug. Thereupon, the cigarettes and
the filter plug are connected to one another, thus forming a
double filter cigarette. Thereafter, the double filter
cigarette is cut in the center to be divided into two filter
cigarettes, which are then separated axially from each other.Further, the filter attachment comprises a device for
detecting the respective dilutions of the manufactured filter
cigarettes and a device for eliminating defective filter
cigarettes, if any, in 
accordance with the results of detection by the
detecting device. Thus, only nondefective filter
cigarettes can be delivered from the filter attachment
to a wrapping
