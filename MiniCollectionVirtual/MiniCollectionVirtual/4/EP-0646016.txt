<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to synthetic peptides
useful for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients,
and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these peptides by
themselves, in a polymerized form or attached to a
macromolecular carrier.Autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune
responses that are directed against self antigens. These
responses are maintained by the persistent activation of self-reactive
T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes are specifically
activated upon recognition of foreign and/or self antigens as a
complex with self Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) gene
products on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC).Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder, the
symptoms of which are caused by an antibody-mediated autoimmune
attack on the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of the post-synaptic
membrane of the neuromuscular junction. This antibody
attack results in loss of acetylcholine receptors and
jeopardizes normal neuromuscular transmission, leading to
episodic muscle weakness, chiefly in muscles innervated by
cranial nerves, and to fatigability.T lymphocytes are considered to play a central role
in the autoreactive process, but the specific immunoregulatory
mechanisms by which the T cells exert their regulatory role
leading to the induction and various clinical manifestations of
MG are poorly understood, and no specific cure is available for
the treatment of myasthenic patients. Presently, treatment is
with cholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine and
neostigmine, thymectomy, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive
agents and plasmapheresis. MG is a well defined autoimmune disorder mediated by
antibodies specific to determinants of the AChR. Specific
genes of the human MHC, the HLA system, were shown to be
significantly associated with the disease. The high frequency
of certain histocompatibility antigens (HLA - B8, DR3) in MG
patients suggests a defect of immunoregulation that might be
expressed on the level of T cells.In previous studies we found that two peptides
representing sequences of the human AChR α-subunit (p195-212
and p257-269) significantly stimulated peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBL) from MG patients in comparison to healthy
controls (E. Mozes et al., EMBO J.8(13):4049-4052; Brocke, S. et al.
(1988), J. Clin. Invest.82:1894-1900).
In addition, a correlation was demonstrated between the
HLA-DR types of the MG patients and their responses to these
peptides. Thus, all patients that expressed HLA-DR3 responded
to p257-269 and 83% of patients who
