<ABSTRACT>
Flashing strip, comprising:   - at least two profiled devices (1 to 4) for protecting a stepped (upstand) flashing (5) of a structure (work) (6), of longitudinal extension, which are intended to be fastened on two faces (61 to 64) respectively of the said structure, forming a dihedron between them, each profiled protection device comprising a protection band (fascia) (12), the inner face of which is oriented opposite the stepped flashing (5); - as well as at least one corner connector (13) including two flanges (wings) (16, 17), having a height which is substantially equal to the height of the two profiled protection devices, forming, between them, a dihedron adapted to that of the structure (6), at least one of which includes means (18, 19) for assembly on one (3) of the profiled protection devices; characterised in that, on the one hand, each profiled protection device is a section obtained by means of a cut adapted in terms of length and optionally in terms of angular size (cut) of a protection profiled section, which comprises, in a manner known per se, a fastening strip (7), capable of interacting with traditional fastening means (9), such as screws, capable of passing through the said strip respectively at a plurality of substantially aligned fastening points, and the inner face of which has at least one zone (11) for bearing against the structure, adjacent to the stepped flashing, and, on the other hand, only one of the flanges of each corner connector, called the first flange (16), includes means for assembly on one (3) of the two profiled protection sections, and the other flange of the same corner connector, called the second flange (17), forms a flap against the outer face of the other profiled protection section (2).
