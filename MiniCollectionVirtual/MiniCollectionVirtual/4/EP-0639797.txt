<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a positive type light-sensitive 
lithographic printing plate (or a positive type presensitized 
plate) and a development processing method of the 
positive type light-sensitive lithographic printing plate. A light-sensitive lithographic printing plate comprises a 
light-sensitive layer provided on a hydrophilic support. 
For example, in a positive type light-sensitive lithographic 
printing plate, an ink-receivable light-sensitive 
layer which is made soluble by exposure of active light 
such as UV ray is formed on a hydrophilic support. In such a positive type light-sensitive lithographic printing 
plate, when a light-sensitive layer is subjected to 
image exposure and then the plate is developed, a portion 
exposed to light of the light-sensitive layer which is ink-receivable 
is removed to expose the surface of the hydrophilic 
support, while the ink-receivable light-sensitive 
layer which is not subjected to exposed to light remains on 
the support to form an ink-receivable layer. In lithographic  
 
printing, there is utilized such a difference in properties 
that the portion exposed to light is hydrophilic and 
the portion which is not exposed to light is lipophilic. In general, a light-sensitive composition containing a o-quinonediazide 
compound as a light-sensitive component and 
an alkali-soluble resin as a component of heightening film 
strength and alkali-soluble property have been used in a 
light-sensitive layer of a positive type light-sensitive 
lithographic printing plate. As the above o-quinonediazide compound, a 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-5-sulfonate 
compound and a 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-4-sulfonate 
compound have been used as 
useful ones. Particularly preferred is an ester compound 
of a polycondensed resin having a o-quinonediazide group 
such as a polycondensed resin of pyrogallol with an 
aldehyde or an ketone. When an ester compound with a polycondensed resin is used 
as the o-quinonediazide compound, a polycondensed resin 
having a weight average molecular weight of 3,000 or more 
has been generally used for the purpose of improving press 
life. As to development, there has been used a method in which 
development is carried out by replenishing a developing 
replenishing solution in order to replenish a developing 
solution component consumed by development processing. When a positive type light-sensitive lithographic printing 
plate using a o-quinonediazide compound as described above 
is developed while replenishing a developing replenishing
