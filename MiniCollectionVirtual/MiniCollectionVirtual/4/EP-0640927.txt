<ABSTRACT>
A Local Area Network (LAN) adapter is provided. The adapter includes both 
a main processor and an auxillary processor. The auxillary processor 

operates under the control of dedicated hardware in the form of a 
horizontally microcoded datapath. This allows more than one operation to 

occur in a single adapter bus cycle, thus speeding up the frame transfer rate 
whilst not sacrificing other operational parameters. The auxillary processor 

operates in this manner to take over some of the tasks / operations formerly 
taken on by the main processor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a processor having frame-processing 
acceleration capabilities for use with, for example, Local Area Network (LAN) 
Systems, It is well known to provide Communications Processors integrating 
complete LAN subsystems and examples of such processors include the TMS 
380Cx6 family produced by Texas Instruments Incorporated. The TMS 
380Cx6 family provides processors which can provide both Token-Ring and 
Ethernet Network protocols. A typical LAN adapter (the TMS 380Cx6) 100 is shown in Figure 1. 
The LAN adapter includes the following main functional blocks: a host 
system interface (SIF) 102; a local microprocessor (CPU) 104; a Protocol 
Handler (PH) 106; and a memory interface (MIF) 108. The SIF provides an interface for the transfer of data and control 
information between the adapter 100 and the Host processor. It comprises a 
direct I/O (DIO) interface, and an intersystem Direct Memory Access (DMA) 
controller. The DIO is used for the transfer of command and status 
information, interrupt passing, and system initialization. The DMA 
controller is used by the LAN adapter CPU for the DMA transfer of data 
between the host and the adapter. The PH is the LAN controller responsible for the Media Access Control 
(MAC) level transmission and reception of frames. It is a list-driven machine 
that can transmit and receive frames without processor intervention. It has 
an interface to the PHY level network interface device 110. The adapter CPU controls the overall LAN adapter. CPU instructions 
are fetched from the external memory 112 connected to the MIF. In DRAM 
based systems CPU code is down-loaded from the host (using DIO) at  
 
initialization. The CPU is responsible for a number of adapter functions 
including:
 
   Executing network frame-level MAC and SMT protocols;
 
   Providing a high-level command interface to the host through SIF 
DMA operations;
 
   Transferring frames between host and adapter;
 
   Managing adapter buffer storage; and
 
   Managing the reception and transmission of network frames. The MIF provides a glue-less DRAM memory interface to the other 
adapter functions. The memory interface bus provided by the MIF also 
supports external bus masters that can access Memory or internal adapter 
registers. The diagram also shows the connection of the adapter to the Host bus 
114 to local DRAM memory (112) and to the Network interface device 110. The performance of TMS 380Cx6 adapters is constrained by the 
management tasks of the CPU, and the complexity of the
