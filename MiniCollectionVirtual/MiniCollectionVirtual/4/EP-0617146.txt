<ABSTRACT>
Copper alloys of aluminum are afforded extended protection 
against surface corrosion by anodizing the aluminum surface to 

be protected, treating the surface with a heterocyclic aromatic 
azole treating agent having up to 16 carbon atoms before, during 

or after the anodizing step, and coating the treated surface 
after anodize with a fatty acid of 5 to 24 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to corrosion protection of aluminum 
alloys with copper, and more particularly to the protection of 
aluminum alloys with copper as the principal though minor 
alloying ingredient by the application of a protective layer 
comprising anodize, fatty acid and a heterocyclic aromatic azole 
treating agent. Tests have shown that a synergistic improvement 
in corrosion resistance is obtained by combining the treating 
agent with fatty acid on anodized aluminum alloy panels, over 
the results obtained by either a fatty acid or the treating 
agent combined with anodize alone. Panels prepared in 
accordance with the invention have shown corrosion resistance 
in standard salt spray tests for over 4000 hours, more than ten 
times the MilSpec requirement of 336 hours. Aluminum alloys with copper, e.g. the Series 1000, 2000 and 
7000 aluminum alloys, are extensively used in architectural, 
aircraft and marine applications, and as such are desirably 
improved in corrosion resistance without adverse trade-offs such 
as increased weight or discoloration. At the same time, 
increasing environmental concerns dictate that improvements be 
obtained without undue use of environmentally hazardous 
chemicals in anodizing, such as chromates. In USP 5,169,458 to Shulman and Bauman, improvements in 
corrosion resistance of aluminum were obtained by conditioning  
 
a freshly anodized aluminum surface with alcohol and treating 
with a fatty acid. Corrosion resistance to as much as 2856 hours 
was obtained using stearic acid and isopropyl alcohol. It is an object therefore of the present invention to 
further improve the corrosion resistance of aluminum, 
specifically aluminum alloys with copper, beyond levels 
previously achieved. It is another object to employ an azole 
treating agent in combination with anodize and fatty acid 
treatments of aluminum copper alloy surfaces. These and other objects of the invention to become apparent 
hereinafter are realized in accordance with the method of 
protecting copper alloys of aluminum against surface corrosion, 
including anodizing the aluminum surface to be protected, 
treating the surface with a heterocyclic aromatic azole treating 
agent having up to 16 carbon atoms before, during or after the 
anodizing step, and coating the treated surface after the 
anodizing step with a fatty acid of 5 to 24 carbon atoms. In preferred embodiments, the method includes selecting an 
aluminum alloy of the 1000, 2000, or 7000 series; anodizing the 
aluminum surface to an
