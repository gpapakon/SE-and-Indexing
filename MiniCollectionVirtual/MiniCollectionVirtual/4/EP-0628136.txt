<ABSTRACT>
A system for burning biomass to fuel a gas turbine (10) which generally comprises a pressurized combustion chamber (54), a feed device (14) for feeding biomass particles into the combustion (54), an air compressor (82) for supplying compressed air to the combustion chamber (54), an ash extracting device (92) for removing ash from the combustion gases (75), a turbine (116) and a central controller (126) for monitoring and controlling various aspects of the system (10). The biomass is fed into the combustion chamber (54) where the particles combust and produce highly pressurized combustion gases (75). The ash extracting device (92) removes the ash in the combustion gases (75) before the combustion gases (75) enter the turbine (116). The highly pressurized combustion gases (75) enter the turbine (116) where they expand to produce work and cause the blades of the turbine (116) to rotate. The turbine (116) drives an electrical generator which is linked to a power transmission line through any suitable switching gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionA System for Burning Biomass to Fuel a Gas TurbineField of Invention This invention relates to a gas turbine power generating system and, in particular, to a system which utilizes the gases resulting from the combustion of biomass to fuel the turbine.Background of the InventionDuring the past decade developing alternative sources of fuel has become an increasing concern for both environmental and economical reasons. Fossil fuels are the traditional source for fueling gas turbine power generating systems. Sources for fossil fuels are becoming scarce and expensive, and concern has arisen about the environmental impact the byproducts of processing these fuels have.In general, an electric power producing turbine system includes an air compressor, a combustion chamber for burning fuel in the presence of the compressed air, a turbine into which the high pressure combustion gases are flowed to expand and produce power, and an electric generator which is powered by the turbine. 

 In an effort to solve the problems of fossil fueled power plants, research has been conducted in using biomass to fuel a turbine system. Wood, in the form of saw dust, and sugar cane bagasse have proven to be viable options for fueling turbine systems. Wood and sugar cane are renewable fuels and the burning of these fuels does not have the negative environmental impact which the traditional fossil fuels have.In developing a system for burning biomass several problems must be overcome. Biomass of the types mentioned above have a much higher combustion temperature than traditional fuels. The combustion chamber must be constructed to withstand such high heats associated with burning these fuels. Controls and sensors must be located throughout the system to avoid serious damage to the entire system from overheating. Because the combustion chamber is both pressurized and maintained at a high temperature, special attention must be paid to how the biomass is fed into the combustion chamber. The feeder system must be able to transport the wood particles from a zone of low pressure to a zone of high pressure while supplying means to protect the feeder system from the high temperature of the combustion chamber. Another problem associated with utilizing biomass as a fuel is that one of the byproducts 

of burning biomass is ash. If the ash is not removed before the combustion gases enter the turbine, the ash will adhere to the turbine blades and clog the system, seriously degrading the performance of the system and damaging the
