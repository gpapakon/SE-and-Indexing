<ABSTRACT>

  in which: R' and R'', which may be identical or different, represent a cholesteryl, behenyl or 2-octyldodecyl radical, and the mixtures of the said co-emulsifying agents, with the proviso that when only one co-emulsifying agent is present, its proportion by weight is less than or equal to 2%,  the remainder consisting essentially of an aqueous phase.   This composition may take the form of a cream, a milk, a mask or may alternatively take the form of a foundation.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic or dermatological composition in the
form of a stable oil-in-water emulsion, characterized in

that it contains:

(a) from 5 to 40 % % by weight of an oily phase
which may contain, in a proportion of less than 15 % by

weight, at least one vegetable oil which has more than
40 % by weight of linoleic acid triglycerides,
(b) from 0.5 to 5 % by weight of an auto-emulsifiable
composition containing from 60 to 90 % by

weight of at least one fatty alcohol having from 12 to
22 carbon atoms, from 10 to 40 % by weight of an alkyl

polyoside, the alkyl chain of which has from 12 to
22 carbon atoms and from 0 to 5 % by weight of

polyoside,
(c) from 0.5 to 4 % by weight of at least one
co-emulsifying agent chosen from fatty acids having from

14 to 22 carbon atoms, the mixtures of the said fatty
acids and fatty alcohols having from 14 to 22 carbon

atoms, alkyl glyceryl ethers, the alkyl chain of which
has from 14 to 22 carbon atoms, the compounds of

formula:


in which:

R' and R", which may be identical or different,
represent a cholesteryl, behenyl or 2-octyldodecyl

radical, with the proviso that when a lone co-emulsifying
agent is present, its proportion by weight

is equal to or less than 2 %, and
(d) the remainder essentially consisting of an
aqueous phase.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the weight ratio between the oily phase and the

alkyl polyoside of the auto-emulsifiable composition is
greater than or equal to approximately 15.
Composition according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the fatty alcohol of the auto-emulsifiable

composition having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms is (C
16
-C
18
)
cetyl/stearyl alcohol and the alkyl polyoside is

cetearyl glucoside.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the co-emulsifying agent is chosen from the

group consisting of: stearic acid, chimyl alcohol, batyl
alcohol and their mixtures as well as the mixture of

stearic acid and stearyl alcohol.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the fatty phase

of the said emulsion additionally contains an adjuvant
chosen from dyes, lipophilic active principles,

sunscreen agents, antioxidants and preservatives.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the aqueous

phase of the said emulsion additionally contains an
adjuvant chosen from dyes, preservatives, hydrophilic

active principles, trace elements, biological
derivatives, polyols, salts, clayey minerals which swell

in aqueous medium, amino acids and aqueous gelling
agents.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it additionally

contains at least one active substance chosen from
essential oils, perfumes, pigments, fillers, vitamins

and ceramides.
