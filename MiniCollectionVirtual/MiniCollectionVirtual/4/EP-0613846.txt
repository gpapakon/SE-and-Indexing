<ABSTRACT>
A paper transport system includes an apparatus (24) for controlling movement of the 
sheets (S₁,S₂) along the predetermined course (P) to provide sheet buffering. The apparatus 

(24) includes first (32) and second (34) friction surfaces mounted for movement in orbital paths 

on opposite sides of the predetermined course (P) in opposed relationship to define a nip (30) 
through which the paper sheets (S₁,S₂) pass. A selectively operable drive (40,42) is provided for 

independently controlling the movement of the first (32) and second (34) friction surfaces, and 
the first friction surface (32) has a coefficient of friction with the paper sheets (S₁,S₂) which is 

greater than the coefficient of friction of the second surface (34) with the paper sheets (S₁,S₂) 
which is in turn greater than the coefficient of friction between the paper sheets (S₁,S₂). In an 

alternative embodiment (Fig. 6), the friction surfaces are provided on corrugation feed rolls 
(68).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed to the art of paper sheet handling and, more
particularly, to a sheet buffering system. In particular, the present invention relates to a sheet buffering apparatus which includes
a pair of spaced apart guide members for defining a predetermined course to direct
sheets seriatim along the predetermined course toward a buffering nip, and first and
second friction surfaces mounted for movement in orbital paths on opposite sides of the
predetermined course in opposed relationship to define said buffering nip through which
the sheets pass, the first friction surface having a coefficient of friction with the sheets
which is greater than the coefficient of friction of the second friction surface with the
sheets which is in turn greater than the coefficient of friction between the sheets.Such a sheet buffering apparatus is known from JP-A-59 138 536. The invention is especially suited for use in the paper handling and transport
system of an electrophotographic printing machine and will be described with reference
thereto; however, as will become apparent, the invention could be used in many types of paper
sheet handling systems in a variety of different machines.In electrophotographic printing machines, it is sometimes necessary or desirable to
temporarily hold or delay the transport of individual paper sheets at various points in the paper
path to provide additional time for downstream processing to be performed. Such temporary
holding or delaying of sheets is generally referred to as "buffering and has been accomplished
in many different ways.One prior art method of buffering is to temporarily slow or stop a roll nip or other
paper transport for a period of time equal to the inter-copy-gap between successive sheets. Of
course, this yields only a very short buffering time. If longer times are required, other systems
must be used. For example, multiple path systems and systems which run sheets against stalled
roll pairs or stop gates have sometimes been used.US-A-4,801,134 discloses a paper feed apparatus capable of feeding common use
papers and specifically processed papers, comprising a feed out roller, a regular rotational
roller for feeding out sheets one by one towards a conveying roller pair at a
downstream position along a paper path defined by paper guides.US-A-2,979,330 discloses a sheet separating device for positively separating sheets of
paper, comprising pairs of axles with corresponding sets of nearly abutting rollers, or
a pair of axles provided with staggered
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sheet buffering apparatus (24; 60) which includes

a pair of spaced apart guide members (26, 28; 62, 64) for defining a
predetermined course (P) to direct sheets (S
1
, S
2
) seriatim along the
predetermined course (P) toward a buffering nip (30), and
first and second friction surfaces (32, 34; 68, 78) mounted for movement in orbital
paths on opposite sides of the predetermined course (P) in opposed relationship

to define said buffering nip (30) through which the sheets pass, the first friction
surface (32; 68) having a coefficient of friction with the sheets (S
1
, S
2
) which is
greater than the coefficient of friction of the second friction surface (34; 78) with

the sheets (S
1
, S
2
) which is in turn greater than the coefficient of friction between
the sheets,
characterized by
the pair of friction surfaces (32, 34; 68, 78) being selectively independently
operable to stop movement of a first one of said pair of friction surfaces (32) while

moving a second one of said pair of friction surfaces (34) to buffer a first sheet
(S
1
) at said nip (30) while impelling a second sheet (S
2
) into said nip (30).
The sheet buffering apparatus as set forth in claim 1, further comprising a pair of

selectively operable drive means (40, 42) for independently controlling the
movement of said pair of friction surfaces (32, 34).
The sheet buffering apparatus as set forth in claim 2, the pair of selectively
operable drive means (40, 42) being adapted to selectively stop and reverse a

direction of movement of said first one of said pair of friction surfaces (32) and 
said second one of said pair of friction surfaces (34) about their respective paths

of orbital movement.
The sheet buffering apparatus as set forth in claim 1, said pair of guide members
(26, 28) being curved to define a predetermined curvlinear course of sheet

movement (P), and a first one of said pair of guide members (26) including a step
region defined therein for positioning a trailing edge of said first sheet (S
1
)
laterally off said predetermined curvlinear course of sheet movement (P)

permitting said second sheet (S
2
) to be received along said predetermined
curvlinear course (P) of sheet movement avoiding contact with said trailing edge

of said first sheet (S
1
).
The sheet buffering apparatus as set forth in claim 4, a second one of said pair of
guide members (28) including a spring member for urging said trailing edge of

said first sheet (S
1
) laterally off said predetermined curvlinear course of sheet
movement (P) and into said step defined in said first one of said pair of guide

members (26).
