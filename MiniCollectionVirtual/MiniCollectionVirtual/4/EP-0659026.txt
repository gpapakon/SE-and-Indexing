<ABSTRACT>
A 3D printer comprises a scanning laser system (91). A donor sheet (81) 
is located in the focal plane of the optical system (91) and carries a 

thermally transferable colourant such as a dye or pigment. A lenticular 
screen (88) has a colourant receiving layer which receives colourant from 

the donor sheet to form 3D pixels, each comprising interlaced 2D pixels, 
aligned with lenticules of the screen (88). 
A detector array (205) responds to laser light which has been transmitted 
through the lenticular screen (88), and a print register control system uses 

the detector output correctly to position the scanning laser beam to 
compensate for irregularities in the lenticular screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for making
a print containing parallax information. Such a method and apparatus
may be used to provide a printer for producing 3D (three dimensional)
hard-copy in full-colour, which printer can be implemented with
technology consistent with a low cost device capable of operation as, for
example, a computer peripheral or fax in an office environment.True 3D displays can provide substantially more information than 2D
displays. There are many applications such as medical imaging and
CAD systems which can benefit from 3D visualisation. Hard-copy
allows this information to be disseminated effectively, particularly if the
image can be produced as an output from a computer workstation (using
computer graphic techniques or digitally captured images). To be
effective, there is a need for a computer peripheral printer with high
speed production technique, ease of use, low cost and convenience of
manufacture. Furthermore, it is very desirable to be able to view the 3D
hard-copy without the use of special viewing aids. This implies that an
autostereoscopic 3D technology is required.A known technique for computer-based 3D hard-copy production
involves multiplexed holography. In this method, computer graphic or
photographic techniques are applied to a 3D data base to construct a
sequence of 2D images on a photographic film, which images are
holographically multiplexed to produce a 3D image. Recently there 
have been suggestions to replace the photographic film with an LCD
(liquid crystal device) as the projection medium in order to speed
production. However, these techniques have problems concerning cost,
true colour, reproduction, materials, illumination requirements, and
hardware fabrication. These problems are not likely to be substantially
overcome in the foreseeable future. All these make holographic methods
impractical for general use as an office computer peripheral printer.Known non-holographic techniques for 3D hard-copy production include
lenticular, microlens and barrier parallax methods. Lenticular methods
are generally superior to barrier parallax in their brightness. Indeed,
lenticular hard-copy displays produced using photographic methods are
quite impressive. Here a special camera arrangement is used to produce
a continuous composite image which can be viewed with minimum
limitations of viewing distance. However, these methods are not suitable
for computer generated or other digital applications.In computer generation and other digital
