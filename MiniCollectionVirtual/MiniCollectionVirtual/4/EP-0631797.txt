<ABSTRACT>
A golf putter and putter head are disclosed which 
incorporates an angled or lofted and limited impact surface 

which imparts to a golf ball minimal lift without imparting 
significant undesirable backspin or skid to the ball, 

thereby minimizing the frictional effect of the ball moving 
accurately toward the target.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to golf putters. When a golf ball is struck by a putter, there is a 
certain amount of backspin or skid during the first part of 
the putt after the ball is impacted by the putter. It is generally acknowledged that, the shorter the 
skid distance of a putted golf ball, the better its 
performance. This result is due, in part, to the 
coefficient of rolling friction which is generally much less 
than that of sliding friction, often as low as a very small 
fraction thereof. Thus, a rolling ball will be less affected 
by surface irregularities of the green or impediments in the 
grass than a sliding ball. Reduction of skid minimizes the 
consequences of shortcomings in accuracy of alignment, 
errors in allowance for distance, the adverse effects of 
grain (direction of grass growth), and minor impediments 
which may be in the path of the ball in the first few inches 
of a putt. In the prior art, when a golf ball is struck in 
its centre by traditional putters being swung squarely in-line 
with the horizontal, the golf ball first skids without 
rolling for some distance before friction between the golf 
ball and the ground slows the golf ball's translational 
motion and induces a rolling action. This distance in which 
the golf ball skids before beginning to roll varies with the 
details of the prior art putter designs as well as the force 
of impact of the putter striking the ball. Efforts to 
minimize this skid condition in design and utilization of 
prior art putters have introduced other problems. For 
example, if the golf ball is struck above its horizontal 
centre line, a forward spin will result, but the ball will 
momentarily be driven slightly downward, thereby increasing 
the normal or perpendicular force on the putting green. 
This downward force can significantly increase the 
undesirable effects of grain and other irregularities in the 
putting surface. Correspondingly, if the golf ball is  
 
struck much below the centre line by a putter (without 
regard to the degree of loft build into the putter head), 
the golf ball will generally be lifted off the putting 
green, thereby reducing or eliminating the frictional force. 
However, in this latter case, the disadvantage is that, as 
the ball is being lifted, a significant amount of backspin 
may be introduced; this backspin will be present in the 
motion of the ball toward the target, producing skid which 
adversely affects control and predictability. Prior art putters and golf clubs of which the 
applicants are
