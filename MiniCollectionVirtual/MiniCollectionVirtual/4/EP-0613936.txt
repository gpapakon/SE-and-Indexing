<ABSTRACT>
A process for reducing the corrosivity of acid water contg. cyanide, ammonium and sulphide ions, using an appts. in which ammonium polysulphide-contg. aq. soln. is metered in and at least a part of the cyanide ions are converted onto thiocyanate ions. The ammonium polysulphide is produced by oxidative reaction in an electrochemical cell from an aq. soln. contg. ammonium ions and sulphide ions, supplied as the acid water from the appts.. The aq. soln. supplied to the electrochemical cell contains 1 g/l of ammonium ion and 200 g/l of sulphide ion. The aq. soln. from the electrochemical cell is prep. from 30-100% of acid water. The corrosivity of the acid water is established by a potential measurement and the metering of the ammonium polysulphide is controlled accordingly. The electrochemical cell is a membrane or diaphragm cell. Acid water is supplied to the anode compartment and an alkali solution to the cathode compartment. The cell is without hindrance between the anode and cathode compartments.

<CLAIMS>
A method for reducing the corrosiveness of an
acidulated water which is treated or carried in a

plant, which water contains cyanide ions, ammonium ions
and sulphide ions, wherein an aqueous solution

containing ammonium polysulphide (APS) is metered in to
the acidulated water in the plant and at least a

portion of the cyanide ions are converted into
thiocyanate ions, characterised in that the APS

solution is produced by oxidation in an electrochemical
cell from an aqueous solution having a content of

ammonium ions, calculated as NH
3
, of at least 1 g/l and
a content of sulphide ions, calculated as H
2
S, of 1 to
200 g/l, the aqueous solution supplied to the

electrochemical cell consisting of 30 to 100%
acidulated water which comes from the plant.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the corrosiveness of the acidulated water is

determined by means of at least one potential
measurement and the metering is regulated with APS

solution accordingly.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in tha
t the electrochemical cell is a cell with a
diaphragm or a membrane.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that acidulated water withdrawn from

the plant is fed into the anode space of the
electrochemical cell, and an alkaline solution into the

cathode space.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the electrochemical cell is formed without an

obstruction between the cathode and anode spaces.
