<ABSTRACT>
To simplify an electronic control device for gas burners of heating installations, the microcomputer MC of the automatic firing unit is extended to take over tasks from the heating regulator. The microcomputer or the device equipped therewith is provided with a signal generator SG, a comparator Ve, a controller R and a temperature watchdog. The signal generator generates, in particular, pulse-width-modulated control signals SST, which are used for controlling a D.C. motor M, which is used as drive element for an air blower G. The comparator compares rotational speed current values of the blower generated by a rotational speed sensor Fn with rotational speed desired values or limiting values stored in the memory SP and, as a function of the type and/or the magnitude of the difference values, triggers control signals SST or influences the latter. Furthermore, the microcomputer outputs control signals to the D.C. motor of the blower during the operational time of the burner as a function of parameters controlling the boiler temperature TK, and takes over temperature watchdog tasks.
