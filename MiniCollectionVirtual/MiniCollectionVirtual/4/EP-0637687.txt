Fuel guidance in the cylinder housing (1) of an internal combustion 
engine having cylinders disposed in series and upright housings (5) with 

receiving bores (6) for push-in pumps (7) which communicate with pipes for 
the feed and return of fuel and of which one crosses the receiving housings as 

a through-passage (3), characterised in that at least approximately at the height 
of the through-passage (3) provided as the fuel return, a continuous 

longitudinal passage (2) is disposed as a fuel feed alongside the push-in 
pumps (7) in the cylinder housing (1) which communicates with the push-in 

pumps (7) via associated oblique bores (4), each of which when extended lies 

within the opening (17) of the associated receiving bore (6). 
Fuel guidance according to Claim 1, characterised in that the housings 
(5) provided for the push-in pumps (7) project away from the long side of the 

row of cylinders and are connected to one another by connecting webs which 
project from the long side and in that the through-passage (3), as a fuel return, 

extends through all connecting webs (8) and housings (5), intersecting these 
latter at least approximately centrally. 
Fuel guidance according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
longitudinal passage (2) lies in the intersection of walls (9, 10, 11) which form 

the boundary walls of adjacent spaces. 
Fuel guidance according to Claim 1, with on each housing a pump 
support provided for the push-in pump, characterised in that in the region 

close to each pump support (15), the inclined bores (4) connected to the 
longitudinal passage (2) open out into the respective receiving bore (6).  

 
Fuel guidance according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised 
in that the longitudinal passage (2) and the through-passage (3) extend over 

the entire length of the cylinder housing (1) and are at both ends of the 
passage closed in sealing-tight manner by a ball closure means (23, 24). 
Fuel guidance according to one of the preceding Claims and which is 
provided for an internal combustion engine with a V-wise arrangement of 

rows of cylinders, characterised in that the oblique bore (4) associated with 
each cylinder in the two rows of cylinders (21,22) is disposed axially parallel 

with the receiving bores (6) of the oppositely disposed row of cylinders. 
Fuel guidance according to Claim 6, characterised in that the respective 
longitudinal and through-passage of both rows of cylinders communicate with 

one another through transverse bores (30, 31) which extend in at least one 
closure cover provided at the end of the cylinder housing. 
Fuel guidance according to Claim 6, characterised in that the respective 
longitudinal and through-passage of the two rows of cylinders are connected 

to one another by transverse bores (30', 31') disposed in the cylinder housing 
(1), so that they extend either in a straight line or in a V (32, 33), converging 

on one another in the nearby area of the bearing block wall (34) of the 
cylinder housing. 
A method of establishing fuel guidance in a cylinder housing as a 
roughly-contoured casting according to one of the preceding Claims, 

characterised in that, in the region of each housing (5) provided for the push-in 
pump (7), the roughly-contoured casting is constructed as a solid part and 

the through-passage (3) and longitudinal passage (2) in the cylinder housing  
 

is drilled by deep-bore drilling and that following the deep-bore drilling firstly 
each oblique bore (4) opening into the longitudinal passage (2) and finally the 

receiving bores (6) accommodating the push-in pump (7) are drilled. 
A method according to Claim 9, characterised in that the deep-bore 
drilling of the longitudinal and through-passages (2, 3) take place in one 

working operation, from both ends of the cylinder housing (1). 
A method according to Claim 9, characterised in that in the upper part 
of the housing (5) which is constructed as a solid part, there is a trough-like 

depression (37) with a lowest point (37a) in the centre of the housing, an 
obliquely extending wall area (37b) of the depression being at the same time 

a drilling-commencement area for the oblique bore (4) which extends at least 
approximately at a right-angle to the drilling-commencement area. 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in 
that, prior to drilling of the receiving bore (6), the area of the housing (5) 

remote from the trough-like depression and provided for the push-in pump, the 
roughly-contoured casting is hollow-cast, the solid part between the hollow 

casting and the depression being of web-like construction.
