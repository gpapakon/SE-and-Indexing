<ABSTRACT>
A homogeneous dry particulate cement mixture in ready-to-use 
form is provided, which comprises ground blast-furnace slag 

having a specific surface area of 500-750 m²/kg and ground fly 
ash having a specific surface area of 500-750 m²/kg, in a 

weight ratio in the range of 20/80-70/30, and further 
comprises the following components in the amounts indicated, 

calculated on the total mixture: at least 2% by weight of 
portland cement clinker and 2-12% by weight of sodium silicate 

(calculated as Na₂O + SiO₂). When processed, the cement mixture 
yields a mortar or a concrete having improved strength 

properties as well as a good resistance against an acidic 
environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cement based on blast-furnace 
slag and fly ash. From "Journal Soc. Chem. Ind." 9, 191-202 (1940) it is 
known to activate blast-furnace slag with an alkaline 
substance to improve its hydraulic properties. Further, "World Cement Technology" 11/12, 223-233 (1977) 
reports on an extensive study into the use of cement based on 
finely ground blast-furnace slag and fly ash in which a 
solution of sodium hydroxide is used as an activator. From "Silicates Industriels" 3, 79-82 (1983) a so-called 
F-cement is known, which yields a concrete of low porosity. 
The F-cement comprises low-lime silicates, such as blast-furnace 
slag and fly ash, and an F additive for activating the 
silicates. The liquid F additive contains an alkaline 
substance and, in addition, a lignosulfate as a dispersing 
agent. Further additives, such as an anti-foaming agent, may 
also be present. From LU-A-31,145 it is known to prepare a cement 
comprising a mixture of fly ash and ground blast-furnace slag. 
Various additives may be added, such as ammonium sulfate, 
calcium sulfate, and calcium chloride. Another additive is 
portland cement in a proportion of 5-10% or an alkaline salt, 
for instance sodium sulfate or sodium silicate. The mixture 
described in the Example comprises blast-furnace slag and fly 
ash in a weight ratio of 65/35, and contains, in addition to  
 
other additives, 7% of portland cement. This known cement is 
claimed to have good strength development characteristics. In an article by P.C. Maheshwari and D.S. Walia entitled 
"On the Process Development of SF Cements" in Indian Chemical 
Manufacturer, 1979, pages 35-39, cement mixtures are reported 
which comprise ground slag and fly ash in a ratio of about 
1:1, to which an activator is added. These known cement 
mixtures do not contain portland cement clinker. The 
activators that were tested are sodium hydroxide, sodium 
silicate, sodium carbonate, and hydrated lime. Only with 
sodium hydroxide could a moderate strength development be 
achieved. EP-A-0 375 081 discloses a homogeneous dry particulate 
cement mixture in ready-to-use form, which comprises blast-furnace 
slag having a specific surface area of 500-650 m²/kg 
and fly ash in a weight ratio in the range of 20/80-60/40, and 
further comprises the following components in the amounts 
indicated, calculated on the total mixture: 
portland cement clinkerat least 2 wt.% sodium silicate (calculated as Na₂O + SiO₂)2-12 wt.%  EP-A-0 375 081 mentions that this known cement mixture can be
