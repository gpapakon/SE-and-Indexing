<ABSTRACT>
A pilot stage for a pressure limiting valve comprises an axially displaceable valve piston (110) which delimits a valve chamber (141) axially at one end and forms a valve seat (140) therein for a closing cone (104). In a pressure chamber (164), the valve piston (110) forms an actuating surface which is considerably larger than the free cross-section of the valve seat (140). By subjecting this pressure chamber (164) to pressure, a large hydrostatic force is exerted on the valve piston (110), this force being opposed to the closing force of the pressure-setting spring (106). A housing stop (130) defines a first axial end position of the valve piston (110) in the direction of this hydrostatic force. The pilot stage has improved properties both in manually adjustable and in proportional pressure limiting valves.

Pilot stage for pressure limiting valves comprising

a valve chamber (132), which is connected to a first control line (133),
a valve seat (140),
a closing element (104), which can be installed with a close fit in the
valve seat (140) and is axially movable in the valve chamber (132), and
a pressure adjusting spring (106), which is assigned to the closing
element (104) in such a way that it exerts on the latter a closing force in

the direction of the valve seat (140),
characterised by
an axially movable valve piston (110), which limits the valve chamber
(132) axially on one side and forms the valve seat (140) therein, the

latter being connected via a connecting duct (142, 144) through the
valve piston (110) to a second control line (156),
a pressure chamber (164), which is connected to a third control line
(158) and in which the valve piston (110) forms an actuating surface

which is substantially larger than the free cross-section of the valve seat
(140) and is arranged in such a way that, as a result of pressure

admission to this pressure chamber (164), a hydrostatic force acting
against the closing force of the pressure adjusting spring (106) is

exerted on the valve piston, and
a casing stop (130) for the valve piston (110), which determines a first
axial end position of the valve piston (110) in the direction of this

hydrostatic force.
Pilot stage according to claim 1, characterised in that the closing
element is a closing cone (104), which is connected rigidly to a damping 

piston (134), which is guided axially in a guide hole (138) of the valve
piston (110).
Pilot stage according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in

that the valve piston (110) is arranged movably in a guide hole (124) of a
valve sleeve (112) and has a first and second cross-sectional area (148

and 150) axially sealed in this guide hole, an inner annular chamber
(146), into which the connecting duct (142, 144) to the valve seat (140)

leads, being delimited between the two cross-sectional areas (148 and
150) inside the guide hole (124), and
that the inner annular chamber (146) is connected to the second control
line (156) via connection open
ings (152) in the valve sleeve (112) and
an outer annular chamber (154) enclosing the valve sleeve (112).
Pilot stage according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that it is
designed as an intermediate plate.
Piloted manually adjustable pressure limiting valve with a main stage
(10), which has a first and second main flow connection and a control

chamber (16), the first main flow connection being connected to a
hydraulic system (18) and the second main flow connection being

connected without pressure via a relief line (20) to a tank (22),

characterised by

a pilot stage (100) according to one of claims 1 to 4 with a manual
adjusting device (108) of the pressure adjusting spring (106), the first

control connection (133) being connected without pressure to the tank
(22) and the second control connection (156) being connected to the

hydraulic system (18) and the control chamber (16) of the main stage
(10), and
a multi-way valve (170) controllable by a control signal, which is
connected to the third control line (158) and has a first and second 

switch position, whereby the pressure chamber (164) of the pilot valve
(100) can admit the pressure in the hydraulic system (18) via the multi-way

valve (170) and a control pressure line (172) in the first switch
position and the pressure chamber (164) can be connected to the tank

(22) without pressure via the multi-way valve (170) and a control tank
line (178) in the second switch position.

characterised by a discharge nozzle (180) installed in the control tank

line (178).
Piloted manually adjustable pressure limiting valve according to claim 5
