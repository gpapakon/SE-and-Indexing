<ABSTRACT>
Oscillator including an amplifier device (T), a capacitive divider bridge (11, 12) the ends of which are connected between a control electrode (A) of the device (T) and a voltage reference (VE), the intermediate node of this bridge being connected to a main electrode (B) of the device (T), and further including, in parallel between the control electrode (A) and the voltage reference (VE), a tuning circuit (20) with parallel branches: a first branch with inductor (La) and variable capacitor (21) in series, a second branch (22, 23) equivalent to a variable capacitor. The tuning circuit (20) has a third branch formed by a capacitor (24), in parallel with the first branch (La, 21), while, between the node (C) linking these last two branches and the node (A) linking the control electrode of the device (T) to the second branch (22, 23) and to the divider bridge (11, 12), a series inductor (Ls) is inserted, the value of which is less than that of the tuning inductor (La). Application: local oscillator for television receivers.

A voltage-controlled frequency oscillator comprising an amplifier device 
(T) which has a main current path defined between a first and a second electrode, and a 

control electrode for controlling the conduction of said device, and comprising a 
capacitive divider bridge (11, 12) effecting a feedback coupling between the first 

electrode of the device and its control electrode, while one terminal of the divider 
bridge is connected to the control electrode and the other terminal is connected to a 

reference voltage (VE) and the intermediate junction point connected to the first 
electrode, said oscillator being also connected to a tuning circuit (20) arranged between 

the control electrode and the reference voltage, which circuit comprises a first parallel 
branch constituted by a tuning inductance (La) arranged in series with a first variable 

capacitance (21) and a second parallel branch equivalent to a second variable 
capacitance (22, 23), characterized in that the tuning circuit comprises a
 third parallel 
branch constituted by a fixed capacitance (24), and in that the assembly of first and 

third parallel branches is connected to the junction point (A) between the control 
electrode of the device and the second parallel branch via a series inductance (Ls) which 

has a smaller value than the tuning inductance (La). 
An oscillator as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the second 
parallel branch is constituted by a fixed capacitance (23) arranged in series with a 

variable capacitance diode (C22) of the same model as the variable capacitance diode 
(C21) constituting said first variable capacitance. 
An oscillator as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the two variable 
capacitance diodes (C21, C22) are controlled by the same variable control voltage (VT). 
An oscillator as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the amplifier device (T) is a bipolar transistor whose base constitutes the control 

electrode, the emitter constitutes said first electrode and the collector constitutes said 
second electrode.
