<ABSTRACT>
The box made of cardboard or the like, with dispensing spout is 
obtained from a blank (F) having rectangular zones (A,B,C,D,E) 

intended to form the side walls of the box and from which upper and 
lower flaps (5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) forming the top and bottom closure 

portions of the box extend. For forming the dispensing spout the blank 
(F) comprises a zig-zag folding tongue (G) divided by converging 

scorelines (16,17) in tabs (13,14,15) forming the walls of the 
dispensing spout and a punched tab (18) having substantially the shape 

of the inner tab (13) of the zig-zag folding tongue (G) and arranged 
so as to be brought in register therewith. The punched tab (18) is 

glued to the outer tab (15) of the zig-zag folding tongue (G) when the 
box is assembled by overlapping and glueing to each other the two 

opposite rectangular zones (A,E) of the blank (F).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to boxes made of cardboard or 
the like and, more particularly, a box provided with dispensing spout 
having a very high strength and an excellent air-tightness. The boxes made of cardboard or the like and provided with dispensing 
spouts are already known in the market. They have usually a parallelepipedal 
shape and a dispensing spout formed on a side wall thereof. 
The dispensing spouts are formed by folded tongues, obtained from a 
starting blank, the outer one of which has a perforated line intended 
to be cut away from the wall in order that the dispensing spout can be 
taken by the fingers and brought in a pulled out position for 
dispensing the contents of the box. However, such dispensing spouts are affected by some drawbacks, among 
which the more important ones are the following: 
easiness of being broken during the cutting operation of the perforated 
line and the pulling out thereof; very poor air-tightness, which is necessary in the case that the box 
content is a perishable product. The former drawback is due to the fact that for opening the box and 
pouring the contents thereof, it is necessary to cut the box along the 
perforated line and pull out the dispensing spout with consequent 
opening of the folded tongues forming it. During the pull out operation 
a breakage of the dispensing spout can occur because it is made 
of cardboard and therefore it can be detached from the box. 
Furthermore, in the case that the dispensing spout is opened and 
closed for a plurality of times, a breakage thereof can occur.  
 The latter drawback is due to the fact that the perforated line serving 
to pull out the spout is made by perforations which communicate 
the environment air with the inner of the box. As a result of this, 
the product packaged in the box can be damaged with time and particularly 
if the product is stored for a long time. The present invention aims at providing a box made of cardboard or the 
like with a dispensing spout which obviates all the above mentioned 
drawbacks and gives the possibility to have a dispensing spout very 
strong and the safety of imparting to the box a perfect air-tightness.  
 US-A-1 975 963 discloses a box having walls of sheet material in which 
a wall has sections bounded by intersecting lines of perforations and 
one of such lines is between said sections and permits separation of 
said sections from said wall to provide an opening in the latter. The 
sections when opened comprise extensions from adjacent walls of

Box made of cardboard or the like with dispensing spout of the 
type obtained from a blank (F) having a substantially rectangular 

strip divided in rectangular zones (A,B,C,D,E) intended to form the 
side walls of the box and from which upper and lower flaps 

(5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) extend, forming the top and bottom closure 
portions of the box, a spout forming tongue (G) attached to one edge 

of the blank strip and divided by converging scorelines (16,17) in 
adjacent tabs (13,14,15) forming the walls of the dispensing spout and 

intended to be folded above each other in a zig-zag manner during the 
assembly of the box, and a punched tab (18) defined by perforated 

lines (19) in the opposite edge of said blank strip, characterized in 
that: 


said spout forming tongue (G) is substantially in the shape of a 
segment of a circle; 
said adjacent tabs (13,14,15) in said spout forming tongue (G) are 
also in the shape of segments of circle having arcs of circle of 

decreasing length from the inner tab (13) to the outer tab (15), 
said punched tab (18) having substantially the shape of the adjacent 
tabs (13,14,15) of said spout forming tongue (G), is arranged so as to 

be brought in register with one of said tabs (13,14,15), and has a 

radius of curvature different from that of the inner tab (13) of the 
spout forming tongue (G), so as to provide an overlapping zone (Z) 

acting as an air-tigthness seal, when the spout is in a closed 
condition, 
said punched tab (18) being intended to be glued to a tab (13; 15) 
of the spout forming tongue (G) when the box is assembled by 

overlapping and glueing to each other the two opposite rectangular 
zones (A,E) of the blank (F). 
Box according to claim 1, characterized in that the adjacent tabs 
(13,14,15) of the spout forming tongue (G) are three in number. 
Box according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that, in order to 
provide said overlapping zone (Z) acting as an air-tightness seal, the 

radius of curvature of the inner tab (13) of said spout forming tongue 
(G) is longer than that of the punched tab (18), when the zone (E) is 

glued over the zone (A) of the box. 
Box according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that, in order to 
provide said overlapping zone (Z) acting as an air-tightness seal, the 

radius of curvature of the inner tab (13) of said spout forming tongue 
(G) is smaller than that of the punched tab (18), when the zone (A) is 

glued over the zone (E) of the box. 
Box according to claim 1, characterized in that the center (O) of 
the radius of curvature of said spout forming tongue (G) having the 

shape of a circle segment is offset from the apexes of said tabs 
(13,14,15) in order to facilitate the folding operation of the spout 

forming tongue (G). 
Box according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the outer tab (15) of said spout forming tongue (G) has the outer side 

convex in shape (K) to facilitate the pulling out operation of the 
dispensing spout.
