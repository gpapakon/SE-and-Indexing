<ABSTRACT>
A digital data recording and reproducing method for use with a disc-shaped storage 
medium (21). Digital data is converted to a sector structure of a predetermined data 

quantity. The converted data is subjected to an error correction and encoding process 
including interleaving. The processed data is then recorded to the disc-shaped storage 

medium (21) rotated at a constant linear velocity, the storage medium having address 
information previously recorded thereon. The address information is composed of 

repetitions of a plurality of sectors. The recording of the data to the disc-shaped 
storage medium is performed in accordance with the address information and in 

increments of a recording unit made of a plurality of sectors including linking and data 
recording sectors. The recording unit is not greater than the number of the repeated 

sectors of the address information. The digital data thus recorded on the storage 
medium (21) is reproduced therefrom in increments of a data recording and reproducing 

unit on which the information is read from a specific location on the disc-shaped storage 
medium (21) to designate the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for formating
and reformating a disc shaped recording medium. More
particularly, the present invention relates to methods for
formating and reformating a disc shaped recording medium
having digital data as computer data recorded thereon.The applicant of this invention proposes a system that
utilizes audio compression technology in recording and
reproducing audio signals to and from a miniature optical
disc for up to 74 minutes.Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a typical disc recording
and reproducing system. Referring to Fig. 1, a disc
cartridge 21 accommodates an optical disc 21B with a
diameter of 64 mm. The optical disc 21B comes in three
types: read-only optical disc, recordable magneto-optical
disc, and hybrid disc containing both a read-only area and a
recordable area.Pre-grooves for optical spot control (i.e., for
tracking control) are formed in advance on the optical disc
21B. In the example of Fig. 1, absolute address data is
recorded in the 
pre-grooves multiplexed with the so-called wobbling signals for
tracking purposes. The absolute addresses will be described later
in detail.A spindle motor 22 rotates the optical disc 21B. The
rotation of the spindle motor 22 is controlled by a servo control
circuit 25. The spindle motor 22 keeps the optical disc 21 rotated
at a constant linear velocity.The disc cartridge 21 has a shutter which opens when the
cartridge is placed on a disc mounting tray and loaded into the
system. If the optical disc 21B is a recordable magneto-optical
disc, a magnetic head 23 for recording is placed on top of the
shutter of the disc. An optical pickup 24 is positioned
immediately below the shutter of the disc 21B.The optical pickup 24 has a light-emitting part and a
light-receiving part. A feed motor 26 controls the movement of the
optical pickup 24 in the radial direction over the optical disc
21B. The servo control circuit 25 provides focusing and tracking
control of the optical pickup 24.A system controller 20 incorporates a microcomputer and
supervises the operation of the entire system. The system
controller 20 is supplied to key input signals from a key group 10
including a playback key, a recording key, a pause key and a stop
key.A display unit 30 displays such time-related data as the
total playing time of the optical disc 21B currently loaded, the
elapsed time of the piece of music being played, the remaining time 
of the piece of music being played, and the total remaining playing
time. The display unit 30 also displays the

<CLAIMS>
A method for formatting a disc shaped recording medium
having address information previously recorded thereon for

forming a plurality of recording units (N), said method
comprising the steps of:


detecting (140) the size of said recording units (N),
dividing (100) said recording units (N) to form
multiple new recording units (N(5)+0, N(5)+1, ...) of a

designated recording unit, and
adding (100) a fixed number of linking (FC, FD, FE) and
data recording (FF) sectors to each of said new recording

units (N(5)+0, N(5)+1, ...), wherein the number of data
recording (FF) sectors is less than in said previously

recorded units (N).
The method according to claim 1,

wherein said new recording unit (N(5)+0, N(5)+1, ...)
comprises at least one data recording sector (FF) and at

least three linking sectors (FC, FD, FE).
The method according to claim 1,

wherein said new recording unit (N(5)+0, N(5)+1, ...) is the
sum of data recording sectors (FF) and at least three

linking sectors (FC, FD, FE), said sum being any sector
count between 4 and 36 inclusive.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
wherein, upon data recording, data indicating the size of

said new recording unit (N(5)+0, N(5)+1, ...) is recorded to
said disc-shaped storage medium (21).
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

wherein in said dividing step (100) the size of said new
recording units (N(5)+0, N(5)+1, ...) is set in accordance

with the type of the data to be handled.
The method according to claim 5,

wherein the size of said new recording units (N(5)+0,
N(5)+1, ...) is designated by a user.
