<ABSTRACT>
An in-line gearshift mechanism (10) for use with a powershift 
transmission of an agricultural vehicle. The gearshift mechanism 

includes a shift lever assembly (12), a shifter 
plate (34) and a switch 

plate (36) each separated by a plurality of spacers and secured as an 
integral unit to a frame portion of an interior of the 

agricultural vehicle. The shifter plate (34) includes a plurality of 
in-line detent positions defining forward upshift, forward, 

forward downshift, neutral, reverse downshift, reverse and 
reverse upshift detent positions at which the shift lever may be 

positioned. The shift lever includes a gear encoder plate (92) on 
which a plurality of switch activating elements (94a,94b,94c) 

are positioned. 
As the shift lever is moved between the above-mentioned detent 

positions, the switch activating elements selectively actuate 
selected ones of a plurality of reed switches disposed on the 

switch plate. The reed switches generate signals indicative of 
the position of the shift lever, which may then be used to inform 

an external controller of the position of the shift lever and 
thus the desired operation (i.e., forward upshift, shift to 

neutral, etc.). In the preferred embodiment a neutral detection 
limit switch (38) is also included which is actuated when the shift 

lever assembly is placed in the neutral position. The preferred 
embodiment also includes a throttle lever (16) for adjusting the speed 

of an engine of the agricultural vehicle. A program further 
determines if forward downshifts or reverse downshifts are in 

fact desired by the operator as the shift lever assembly is moved 
through the forward downshift and reverse downshift positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gearshift mechanisms and, more 
particularly, to an in-line gearshift mechanism for controlling 
the directional mode of operation and gear selection of a 
powershift transmission of an agricultural vehicle. Gearshift mechanisms are used in a wide variety of 
applications to allow an operator to control a transmission of 
a vehicle so as to select not only a directional mode of 
operation of the vehicle, but a specific gear in which the 
transmission of the vehicle is to be operated. Traditionally, heretofore developed gearshift mechanisms 
have usually required shifting to be performed in an "H" pattern, 
or some variation thereof. Accordingly, when shifting from, for 
example, first forward gear to, for example, third forward gear, 
the operator is required to not only move the gearshift lever 
linearly but also perpendicularly for a brief period of travel, 
and then typically linearly again. Accordingly, many shifts 
between gears, or between directional modes of operation, require 
the operator to move the gearshift lever in two or three distinct 
directions. Even with direction "reverser" transmissions, where 
levers are moved generally in a straight path, multiple levers 
are required to accomplish multiple gear selection.  
 In many applications, particularly agricultural and off-road 
earth moving applications, frequent shifting is required by the 
operator. The multiple, distinct movements required by the 
traditional gearshift mechanisms can often add significantly to 
the fatigue of the operator over the course of several hours of 
operation of the vehicle. The requirement of moving the 
gearshift lever in several distinct directions to accomplish a 
gearshift is further more apt to cause the operator to 
unintentionally select an unwanted gear, which may in turn 
needlessly stress or damage the transmission and/or engine of the 
vehicle. Thus, there exists a definite need to provide a gear 
shift mechanism which provides shifting action (i.e., shift lever 
movement) in logical directions to accomplish directional mode 
changes, as well as upshifts and downshifts, all with a single 
gearshift lever and with in-line shift movements. US patent number 4425620 discloses a transmission control system 
comprising a gear shift lever for selecting forward, neutral and reverse 
modes and lever position sensing means for providing signals indicative 
of the position of the lever. It also comprises a separate lever for 
providing upshift and downshift electrical signals in
