<ABSTRACT>
A logic gate is disclosed which includes a first 
logic gate circuit for generating an output signal 

representative of a function of two or more input 
signals. The present invention provides a NOR gate with 

a self-latching output, with minimal parts count and 
power consumption, which is suitable for use in a PAL 

system. 
Polarity option control logic is disclosed which 
provides an optimized design for a macrocell of a 

programmable logic array with a minimal parts count. 
Finally, an initialization circuit is disclosed 
which includes a latch circuit for providing a first 

stable output state immediately after the application of 
power thereto and a second stable output state at a 

certain delay on the application of power or when the 
power reaches a predetermined level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an initialization circuit for 
use, for example, in programmable logic arrays (PLAs) or more 
specifically, programmable array logic (PAL) circuits. While the present invention is described herein with reference to 
illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be 
understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those having 
ordinary still in the art and access to the teachings provided herein 
will recognise additional modifications, applications, and embodiments 
within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the present 
invention would be of significant utility. Programmable logic arrays provide "glue logic" for PC (printed 
circuit) boards. Glue logic is the logic required to interface two 
boards and generally includes a plurality of AND gates, OR gates and 
input/output I/O buffers. PLAs consume less space and therefore 
generally provide glue logic in a less costly manner than individual 
AND gates OR gates and I/O buffers. PLAs also offer the advantage of reconfigurability over discrete 
or individual gates. That is, PLAs generally include an array of "AND" 
gates, an array of "OR" gates, and some provision for interconnecting 
the outputs of selected AND gates to the inputs of selected OR gates. 
OLAs allow a wide varity of logic functions to be implemented through 
the combination, via the OR gates, of the product terms, provided by 
the AND gates. Further, the configuration of the array may be quickly, 
easily and relatively inexpensively reprogrammed to implement other 
functions. As described in U.S. Patent No. 4,124,899 programmable array 
logic circuits were developed to provide further improvements in the 
speed, space requirements, cost and power consumption of PLAs. In a 
most general sense, a PAL provides a field programmable logic array in 
which a programmable array of circuit inputs are provided to a 
plurality of AND gates to generate product terms. Outputs from  
 
subgroups of AND gates are, in turn, nonprogrammably connected as 
inputs to individual, specified OR gates to provide the sum of 
products. Hence, PALs provide programmable AND and fixed OR functions 
relative to generic PLAs. One PAL device is a zero power standby device. Power is 
consumed only when the inputs switch from one address to another. The 
power up initialization of such PALs is therefore somewhat problematic 
in that when power is applied to the PAL device, the inputs are not 
switching. That is, even if the inputs are proper for a given
