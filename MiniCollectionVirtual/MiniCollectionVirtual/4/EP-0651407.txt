<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the method, a specific amount of solder is initially applied to the connecting pin (4, 5) which is provided with the winding end. The solder can be applied, for example, by immersion of the pin end in a solder bath (11) at a relatively low temperature, or by melting a solder wire. Subsequently, the solder is melted, using a welding burner (13) under a barrier gas (protective gas), at the soft-soldering temperature. In this way, flux-free soldering is possible without the high thermal stress of welding.

Method for contacting the winding wire (6) of a
coil with a terminal post (4, 5), an end portion (7, 8)

of the winding wire being looped with a plurality of
turns around the terminal post and being connected to the

terminal post by a contactless, briefly acting supply of
heat (13), under inert gas and using a soft solder,

characterized in that, after the winding wire has been
wound on, the solder 10) is brought into contact, free of

fluxes, with the terminal post (4, 5) and is subsequently
melted by the heat source (13) at the soldering

temperature.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that heat is supplied by an arc under inert gas (TIG

arc).
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the arc has a burn time of 100 to 300 msec, depending

on the cross-section of the terminal post, and in
that the welding current is set in such a way that a

temperature of 300 to 400Â°C is reached.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that heat is supplied by a laser beam.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that, before the winding end is wound

on, the terminal post (4, 5) is pressed into a non-round
cross-sectional shape in the winding-on region.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the solder is applied by dipping the post

tips briefly into a solder bath, the temperature of which
is only slightly above the melting point of the solder, 

and in that the quantity of solder adhering during this
is subsequently melted.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the solder is slipped in the form of a

preshaped ring (31) onto the free end of the terminal
post (4) and is thereafter melted.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the solder is supplied in the form of a

wire (21), an end portion (21a) of the solder wire being
brought into contact with the terminal post (4) and then

being melted.
