<ABSTRACT>
A reactor for the biological treatment of waste water comprises a reactor vessel (1) intended to receive support material. Biomass is able to adhere to this material. The reactor vessel has an inlet (2) for the water to be treated and an outlet (3) for treated water. A number of module tanks (4) adjoining one another, over which said support material can be distributed, are placed in the reactor vessel. These module tanks can individually be inserted in and removed from the reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reactor for the biological treatment of waste 
water, comprising a reactor vessel intended to receive support material 
in the form of a great number of pieces such lava fragments, plastic 
rings or cylinders or corrugated sheeting-like packages, to which biomass 
can adhere, which reactor vessel is provided with an inlet for water to 
be treated and an outlet for treated water. Reactors of this type are known and are intended for fixed bed systems in 
which the support material is fitted in the system so that it is 
immobile. Examples of fixed bed systems are oxidation beds (trickling 
filters) for the aerobic treatment of waste water and submerged filters 
for the anaerobic treatment of waste water. In order to fix the support 
material for the biomass in the system, it is known in the case of 
aerobic trickling filters to fill the reactor vessel with small pieces of 
support material in the form of lava fragments, plastic rings or 
cylinders. It is also known to fill the reactor vessel with packages of 
corrugated sheeting-like constructions which are fitted staggered 
relative to one another. A disadvantage of these systems is that they are susceptible to blockage, 
which is caused by solid particles in the waste water or by excessive 
growth of biomass or by precipitate formation. In order to remove a 
blockage, the reactor has to be completely shut down, the water has to be 
discharged and the support material has to be removed by hand and 
replaced by cleaned or fresh support material. It will be obvious that 
removal of a blockage in this way takes considerable time. In addition, 
odour problems can arise. The aim of the invention is to overcome this disadvantage and to this end 
the reactor specified in the preamble is characterised in that a number 
of module tanks adjoining one another so that the horizontal cross 
section of the reactor vessel is occupied by the module tanks, and over 
which said support material pieces can be distributed, are placed in the 
reactor vessel, which module tanks can individually be inserted in and 
removed from the reactor. By replacing one or a few module tanks at specific times by clean module  
 
tanks which are ready for use, the time for which the reactor is shut 
down can be kept to a minimum. In particular, if the module tanks are fixed at their tops in an easily 
detachable manner, the tanks can be removed without the water having to 
flow out of the reactor. A robust, easily detachable anchoring of the module tanks is

Reactor for the biological treatment of waste water, comprising a 
reactor vessel (1) intended to receive support material in the form of 

a great number of pieces such lava fragments, plastic rings or

adhere, which reactor vessel is provided with an inlet (2) for water 
to be treated and an outlet (3) for treated water, characterised in 

that a number of module tanks (4) adjoining one another so that the 
horizontal cross section of the reactor vessel is occupied by the 

module tanks, and over which said support material pieces can be 
distributed, are placed in the reactor vessel (1), which module tanks 

can individually be inserted in and removed from the reactor. 
Reactor according to claim 1, characterised in that the module 
tanks are fixed in an easily detachable manner at their tops. 
Reactor according to claim 2, characterised in that the module 
tanks rest, at some distance above the base of the reactor vessel, on 

supports (5, 6) from which tension anchors (7) extend upwards to above 
the top of the modules through a slot in clamp plates (9), each clamp 

plate (9) pressing on the corners of a number of module tanks (4) and 
being detachably fixable by means of a wedge which is inserted through 

an eye in the upper end of a tension anchor (7). 
Reactor according to claim 3, characterised in that planks (11, 
12), which are fixed by means of the clamp plates (9), are placed over 

the top edges of the module tanks. 
Reactor according to one of the preceding claims, characterised by 
baffle plates (15, 16) to cause water to flow from the inlet via 

vertical downward and upward flows through the successive module tanks 
to the outlet.
