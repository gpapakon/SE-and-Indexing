<ABSTRACT>
The installation is of the double column type (5), comprising a first column (6) for nitrogen/oxygen separation, fed with the air to be treated, and a second column (7) for nitrogen/hydrogen separation, the head of which is coupled to the chamber of the first column via an evaporator/condenser (10), and which includes a chamber evaporator (11), and a nitrogen cooling circuit (12) whose high-pressure part feeds the chamber evaporator (11) of the second column (7), then this second column itself. The installation furthermore comprises means (10; 10A) for condensing the nitrogen in the high-pressure circuit by vapourising liquid in the tank of the first column (6).

Process for producing ultra-pure nitrogen by air 
distillation, of the type in which : 


air to be treated is separated in a first column (6) into 
top nitrogen and into bottom liquid rich in oxygen; 
the top nitrogen is used for circulating in a refrigerating 
cycle, a stream of cycle nitrogen from the high pressure part 

being purified from hydrogen in a second column (7) comprising 
a bottom reboiler (11) which ensures that this nitrogen is 

condensed before being introduced into this second column and 
a top condenser (10) cooled by the bottom liquid from the 

first column (6); 
bottom liquid from the second column (7) being conveyed to 
the first column (6) after a pressure reduction stage: 
ultra-pure production nitrogen being withdrawn (at 24) from 
the second column (7), and at least part of the nitrogen 

condensed by vaporizing bottom liquid from the first column 
(6) being purified from hydrogen in the second column (7), 
 
characterized in that a second stream of the cycle nitrogen 

from the high pressure part is condensed (in 10; 10A) by 
vaporizing bottom liquid from the first column (6) and at 

least part of the nitrogen condensed by vaporization of the 
bottom liquid from the first column (6) is introduced in 

reflux at the top of the first column (6). 
Process according to claim 1 wherein at least part of the 
nitrogen condensed by vaporizing the bottom liquid from the 

first column (6) is introduced into the second column (7).  
 
Process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein a variable part 
of the air is conveyed to a by-pass valve (16) of an air 

expansion turbine (4). 
Installation for producing ultra-pure nitrogen of the 
type comprising a double distillation column (5) which itself 

comprises a first column (6) for separating nitrogen and 
oxygen, supplied by the air to be treated, and a second column 

(7) for separating nitrogen and hydrogen, the top of which is 
coupled to the bottom of the first column by a reboiler-condenser 

(10) and which comprises a bottom reboiler (11), 
means for withdrawing a gas enriched in hydrogen, and a 

nitrogen refrigerating cycle (12) of which the high pressure 
part supplies the bottom reboiler (11) of the second column 

(7) and then this second column itself, means (22) for 
expanding bottom liquid from the second column and for 

introducing it into the first column, and means (24) for 
withdrawing ultra-pure production nitrogen from the second 

column (7), characterized in that it comprises in addition 
means (10; 10A) for condensing high pressure cycle nitrogen by 

vaporizing bottom liquid from the first column (6), and means 
for introducing at least part of the liquid nitrogen coming 

from the said means of condensation (10) in reflux at the top 
of the first column (6). 
Installation according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the said means of condensation comprises passages for high 

pressure cycle nitrogen in the said reboiler-condenser (10). 
Installation according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the said means of condensation comprises an auxiliary 

reboiler-condenser (10A) mounted in parallel with the 
reboiler-condenser (10) of the first column (6). 
Installation according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the auxiliary reboiler-condenser (10A) is mounted outside the 

first column (6).  
 
Installation according to any one of claims 4 to 7, 
characterized in that it comprises means for introducing at 

least part of the liquid nitrogen coming from the said means 
of condensation (10) into the second column (7).
