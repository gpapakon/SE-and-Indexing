<ABSTRACT>
Improvements for fluid meters, to be used in conventional 
fluid meters, in which there is no proportionality 

between the speed of the fluid that flows 
through it and the movement of its measuring part, the 

same being the cause of errors in the measurements 
upon directly taking the information transmitted by 

said measuring part as the basis for determining the 
measurement. This problem is eliminated upon including 

the electronic automatic correction system, which 
previously compares said information with a data base 

recorded in its memory, making the necessary corrections 
and providing the reading of a very precise real 

volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
As is expressed in the title of the present specification,
the present invention consists of a
fluid meter, which can be any type
of meter that has or may have a magnetic signal, as transmission
of movement of the measuring part.The fluid meter includes
an electronic correction circuit, which
receives the signal transmitted through a magnetic sensor,
compares said signal with the data stored in its
memory, processes and corrects the information and provides
the value of the real volume consumed.On the other hand, the fluid meter can carry out a
series of functions that represent an important advance,
so that the meter does not inform only about external
incidences of the same (detection of leakage, control only for
hot water, etc.), but also about internal incidences
of the same (indication of the state of the batteries,
indication of internal faults, etc.)In short, obtainment of a very precise measurement
of the water consumed, as well as information about the
existence of leaks so that appropriate action may be
taken in order to prevent the same is obtained among
other things.Besides, it can measure just the hot water consumed,
for which the control will be made as of a
specific temperature.This represents some big advantages not only for
the user but for society in general, since if a large
number of leaks that are produced can be detected and
eliminated, a large saving of water is achieved, which
is not used but rather wasted, water being such a
scarce commodity.In order to center the description of the object
of this invention, for the purpose of providing a better
understanding and as a example, as of now we will refer
to water meters, including home water meters, as well as
industrial ones, without this implying any restriction
to the use of said improvements to any type of meter
capable of measuring the consumption of any fluid and
that can include the proposed improvement, thus increasing
its advantages in terms of precision and/or increasing
the measuring range of the meter.The supply of drinking water to consumers and to
industry is becoming a problem, on the one hand due to
the volumes needed, which are larger and larger, and on
the other hand, due to the scarcity thereof. Consequently,
the costs for obtaining, transporting and treating water
are higher and higher for society and a correct control
of consumption is a very important requirement.Technology has echoed this need and the apparatus
used to measure consumption, meters, have undergone
noteworthy improvements over the last decades in
