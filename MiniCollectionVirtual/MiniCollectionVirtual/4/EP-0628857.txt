<ABSTRACT>
In a keyboard for a photographic printing apparatus 
comprising a set of entry keys arranged on a board base for 

entering corresponding data to correct the exposure and/or 
the color tone, a primary group of the entry keys are 

linearly aligned at the home position and the remaining keys 
are disposed along the path of fingers of the operator 

defined by inward and outward movements of the wrist of the 
operator about the home position so that the entire entry 

keys of the keyboard extend in an arc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic printing apparatus having a keyboard comprising
entry keys to perform exposure compensation and/or color correction.In a known photographic printing apparatus, an optimum
of the exposure for a desired picture frame of a color
negative film is determined by measuring a total transmitted
portion of the irradiation of light fallen on the negative
frame. It is however difficult to make prints with 100 %
perfect exposure because the frames are varied from each
other in the conditions of shooting and the type of an
object.For compensation, each frame of the color negative film
or its simulated image is viewed and examined by the operator
of the photographic printing apparatus. More specifically,
the operator enters corrected values of the exposure
to a computer using entry keys of a keyboard to produce a
print with an optimum result.Such a keyboard associated with a conventional photographic
printing apparatus comprises a set of entry keys 20
to 29 arranged linearly in a horizontal row on a board base
A2 as shown in Fig. 2. Another keyboard shown in Fig. 3 has
a set of entry keys 30 to 39 arranged in a matrix on a board
base A3, similar to the arrangement of common ten keys.The former is capable of accommodating a multiplicity 
of keys in a given space for the purpose of space saving.
Its disadvantage is that the lateral movement of a hand H
of the operator in selecting desired entry keys is
extensive to left and right as defined by the arrow in
Fig. 2, thus causing the operator to stretch his or her
arm AR.The arrangement of keys in the latter is not designed
to ease the continuous action of operating the keys. In
fact, the operator needs to move his or her arm AR in
zigzag or crosswise actions as shown in Fig. 3.As understood, the conventional keyboards for the
photographic printing apparatus are rather low in the
controllability. Also, their home positions are not
obvious making it difficult for beginner operators to
learn a blind-touch typing technique.GB-A-2191655, discloses a keyboard for a color
photographic printing apparatus, including a color and
density correction key arrangement, a function key
arrangement, a color paper type input key arrangement, a
start key, a negative inspection key, a print key, a
printing condition selection key arrangement, and a
printing exposure control mode selection key arrangement.
Each group of keys is arranged in a separate block.In CH 651504-A5, a keyboard for electronic apparatus
is disclosed which includes two

<CLAIMS>
A photographic printing apparatus having a keyboard (A), the keyboard (A) comprising
a set of data entry keys (N, 1 to 4 and 1A to 4A) arranged on a board base (A1), wherein said

data entry keys (N, 1 to 4, 1A to 4A) are arranged to enter
exposure correction data and/or color tone correction data, and

a first subset (N, 1, 1A) of said data entry keys (N, 1 to 4, 1A to 4A) is linearly aligned in the home
positions for fingers of one hand; characterized in that

all data entry keys in said set of data entry keys (N, 1 to 4, 1A to 4A) lie substantially on the same single arc, wherein
a second subset (2 to 4, 2A to 4A) of said data entry keys (N, 1 to 4, 1A to 4A) is disposed

along the path of fingers of the operator defined by movements of the wrist of said hand
from said home positions towards the left and right of said keyboard (A), whereby said

pivoting movements move said fingers of said hand from said home positions towards the
left and right of said keyboard (A) without substantial translation of said wrist.
A photographic printing apparatus having a keyboard (A) as claimed in claim 1,
wherein a plurality of control keys (M1 to M5) are arranged on the board base (A1) at a

location within the curvature of said single arc.
