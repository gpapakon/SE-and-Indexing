<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
an ink jet recording apparatus using an ink jet
recording head. More specifically, the present
invention is directed to an ink jet recording
apparatus capable of recording a color image on a
recording medium without ink blurring by thinning
the image by excluding some of ink dots.Color ink jet recording apparatus ejects a
plurality of ink droplets onto a recording medium
to form a single pixel. A color image may be
formed by varying the sort of ejecting ink. This
conventional ink jet recording apparatus records
on the recording medium at high speed using, for
example, low viscosity ink (mainly containing
water). Extremely high ink absorbing speed and
absorbing capacity are required to the recording
medium. Various sorts of coat paper for ink jet
recording purposes have been developed which owns
thick ink absorbing layers. However, the ink
absorbing speed and the absorbing capacity of
this coat paper do not meet the requirements of
the color recording using four different color
inks. Accordingly, the ink blurs at the edge of
the color, boundary among different colors, and
high density area, so that printing sharpness is 
lowered and ink concentration happens to
fluctuate.On the other hand, in view of cost, curling,
weights and so on, a recording medium with thin
coat layer and a recording medium of plain paper
are preferable. However, when a color image is
recorded on such recording paper, the ink blurs
conspicuously. The bleeding of ink is occurred
at the color mixture portion on the plain paper
and the plain paper cockles. The quality of the
image is debased by the contacts of the ink
ejecting surface of the rcording heads with the
paper while the heads are moving. Furthermore,
the ink is offset by the paper transporting
roller, so that the quality of the image is
debased. A similar problem occurs on OHP film
having low ink absorbing capacity. There are
some problems, taking account of the properties
of the recording head. The ink on the convex
portion of the recording material is attached on
the ink ejecting plane of the recording head,
which cause no ink to be ejected from the ink
ejecting ports. In addition, the water repellent
effect of the ink ejecting plane would be weaken
due to sliding between the convex portion and the
recording head, so that the ink may be readily
attached to the ink ejecting planes.The present invention has been made in an
attempt to solve the above-described problems,
and therefore, has a concern to provide an ink
jet recording
