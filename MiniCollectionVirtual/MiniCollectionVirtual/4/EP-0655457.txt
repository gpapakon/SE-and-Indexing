<ABSTRACT>
A novel sialic acid derivative containing moranoline, represented by general formula (I), which has a cell fusion inhibitor 
activity and is useful as a medicine for preventing or treating inflammation and accompanying thrombosis, rheumatism, immuno-logical 

diseases, viral infections and cancer, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl and R² represents hydroxy or lower 
alkoxy, or alternatively R¹ and R² may be combined together to represent a single bond; and R³s may be the same or different 

from one another and each represents hydrogen or acetyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel moranoline derivatives of the 
following general formula [I]. The compounds of the present invention are 
useful in the medical field, for example as an antiinflammatory agent or an 
antiviral agent. 
wherein R¹ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R² represents hydroxy or 
lower alkoxy, or R¹ and R², taken together, represent a single bond; R³ may 
be the same or different and each represents hydrogen or acetyl. Recent research has revealed that the carbohydrate moieties of 
glycolipids and glycoproteins containing a sialic acid have receptor 
functions for hormones, bacterial toxins, viruses, etc. and are profoundly 
concerned in fundamental, dynamic vital phenomena such as cognition, 
differentiation, growth, adhesion, canceration, immunity and aging of cells. Therefore, sialic acid derivatives are attracting attention as 
substances having useful physiological activities and are being explored for 
potential application to the therapy, diagnosis and prevention of diseases. 
Such antiviral agents are disclosed in Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho 63-139193 
and 03-251593 and the like, and immunomodulators are described 
in Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho 61-243074 and 62-209094. Furthermore, 
the application of such derivatives to cancer diagnosis and therapy is 
described in Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho 61-63700, for instance.  The inventors of this invention explored into a variety of carbohydrate 
antigen derivatives and discovering novel carbohydrate antigen derivatives 
inclusive of certain moranolines, which have excellent pharmacologic 
activities, already applied for patent (Japanese Application No. 04-46081). However, since these sialic acid derivatives occur only in trace 
amounts in the natural kingdom, consider able difficulties are encountered in 
obtaining them as pure simple compounds from a living body. It is for this 
reason that research into sialic acid derivatives as drugs has only just begun 
in these recent few years, although great hopes are harbored for their 
clinical application. The object of this invention is to provide a moranoline derivative 
which is useful as a medicine and is novel in chemical structure. The inventors continued research with increased enthusiasm and 
found that compounds of general formula [I], which are sialic acid derivatives 
of glucose type and galactose type moranolines, are suitable for the above-mentioned 
object. This invention has been developed on the basis of the 
above finding. The essence of this invention lies in
