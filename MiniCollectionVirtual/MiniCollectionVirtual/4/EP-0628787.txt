<ABSTRACT>
An optical sensing device including a light source, 
polarizing beam splitter, and a pair of photodectors. In 

a preferred embodiment, the device includes a reflecting 
device behind the polarizing device to allow the detectors 

to be positioned on one side of the polarizing device to 
make it more compact. 
The optical sensing device allows an object to be 
positioned at various angles and still provide consistent 

sensing, since the device compares one component of 
pol
arized light with respect to the other component of 
polarized light.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an optical sensing device 
which detects optically the presence of an object, what 
type of object it is, or the condition of its surface. Various sensing devices have been proposed to detect 
the condition of an object's surface. Typical of these is 
a sensing device which detects surface condition optically 
by projecting light from a luminous device onto an object 
and detecting by means of a photodetector device the light 
reflected by the object. In this way the sensing device 
can detect the condition of the object. Figure 46 shows a basic model of an existing sensing 
device to detect surface condition. The light emitted by 
luminous device LED a strikes the surface of object b 
obliquely. The reflected light is received by two 
photodetectors c and d. Photodetector element c is the 
device which receives the component of the light directly 
reflected by object b, and photodetector element d receives 
the component of the light which is scattered as it is 
reflected. The electrical outputs of photodetector 
elements c and d are then compared. With the detector shown in Figure 46, if object b has 
a smooth surface, the quantity of light striking 
photodetector c will be greater than that striking 
photodetector d. If the surface of object b is uneven, the 
quantity of light striking photodetector d will be greater 
than that striking photodetector c. Thus, by comparing the 
electrical outputs of photodetectors c and d, we can detect  
 
the condition of the surface of object b. With the prior art sensing device described above, the 
quantity of light striking photodetector c will vary 
greatly if the position or angle of object b is changed. 
Such changes will have a relatively small effect, however, 
on the quantity of light striking photodetector d. The 
fact that the output ratio of photodetectors c and d will 
vary with changes in the object's position or orientation 
makes it difficult to detect the condition of the object's 
surface in a consistent fashion. Furthermore, although this prior art detector can 
discriminate among a variety of uneven surfaces, it cannot 
distinguish between different types of objects (for 
example, between a smooth metal and glass). Its range of 
applications, then, as a sensing device to detect surface 
condition, is limited. It would be desirable to provide an optical sensing 
device capable of detecting, in a consistent fashion, the 
condition of the surface of an object, without being 
affected in a significant manner by changes in the
