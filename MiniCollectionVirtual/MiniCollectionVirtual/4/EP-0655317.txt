<ABSTRACT>
A method that is suitable for use in a rapid prototyping 
system and comprises separating a part (18) from a support (20) 

structure. The method comprises the steps of forming and 
shaping an interface (22) between a part (18) and a support 

structure (20); and determining the forming and shaping 
functionalities automatically depending on forces which are 

acting on a part during construction, so that adhesion 
between a part (18) and a support structure (20) is reduced and 

structural integrity for a part is maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method which is suitable for 
separating a support structure from a part which has been 
developed by a rapid prototyping system. Rapid prototyping systems can provide a capability for 
building three-dimensional objects or parts directly from 
computer aided design (CAD) models. This capability has introduced a significantly enhanced 
flexibility in current manufacturing processes. For 
example, manufacturing processes that involve a design, 
redesign, prototyping or production of three-dimensional 
models, molds or patterns, may now be efficiently realized 
in a matter of hours or days, not months, thereby obviating 
slower, more complex and expensive manual machining techniques. Rapid prototyping systems subsume at least seven technologies, 
including sterolithography, selective laser 
sintering, ballistics particle manufacturing, photochemical 
machining, fused deposition, layered object manufacturing 
and polymerization. A common feature of these seven technologies is that 
objects or parts are typically developed in horizontal  
 
layers, from the ground up. Moreover, for several of these 
technologies, for example, stereolithography, a 
"scaffolding" or support structure capability is 
advantageously employed concomitantly with the development 
of a layered part, so that e.g., a part may be supported 
against the force of gravity as it is being constructed. 
Again, in the case of fused deposition modeling, in which 
materials are extruded from a nozzle, a scaffolding or 
support structure may be advantageously used to resist 
tensile forces between material and the nozzle. A typical example of a development of a part and associated 
support structure is shown in FIG. 1. In particular, Fig. 
1 shows an assembly 10 comprising a part 12 and a support 
structure 14 which conforms or mates to an underside of the 
part 12. We make the following critique of the Fig. 1 
assembly 10. First, when the part 12 is completed, it is necessary to 
separate the part 12 from the temporal support structure 
14. Preferably, this separation action requires a minimal 
effort, and has no deleterious effect on a surface or fine 
feature of the part 12. We have discovered, however, that the separation of the 
part 12 from the support structure 14 can be labor intensive 
and require special tools. Moreover, the separation 
action can result in a derogation of fine features, 
including a ripping or tearing of the part 12. We moot that this problem of efficiently and cleanly separating 
the part

wherein step (a) comprises locating material in the 

interface between a part and a support structure at preselected 
locations, said preselected locations being 

determined so that forces acting on a part during its 
construction are counteracted.

wherein step (a) comprises forming and shaping an interface 

comprising dots spaced in intervals along a support 
structure. 
A method according to claim 1, 
wherein step (a) comprises forming and shaping an interface 

comprising a layer produced of varying density as 
compared to a part.
