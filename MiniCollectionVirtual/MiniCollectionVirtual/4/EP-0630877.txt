<ABSTRACT>
An improvement is proposed for the removal of the precipitates 
of a phosphine oxide compound as a by-product from a mixture 

thereof with an olefin compound obtained by the Wittig reaction 
for the preparation of the olefin compound from a phosphorane 

compound and a carbonyl compound. Instead of the conventional 
procedure of filtration to remove the precipitates, the mixture in a 

hydrocarbon solvent, after replacement of a non-hydrocarbon solvent 
with a hydrocarbon solvent, if necessary, is admixed with a 

lower carboxylic acid such as acetic acid so that the precipitates of 
the phosphine oxide are dissolved forming a viscous fluid which is 

immiscible with the mixture of the olefin compound and the hydrocarbon 
solvent. The fluid containing the dissolved phosphine oxide 

compound can be easily removed by phase separation so that a 
great increase is obtained in the yield of the desired olefin compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in the preparation of an 
olefin compound or, more particularly, relates to an improvement in the step of, 
in the process for the synthetic preparation of an olefin compound having 
usefulness as agricultural chemicals, perfumes, biologically active substances 
and the like by the so-called Wittig reaction for the synthesis of an olefin 
compound, isolating the olefin compound as the product from the reaction 
mixture with high efficiency. As is known, the Wittig reaction is one of very efficient routes for the 
synthetic preparation of an olefin compound, in which the carbonyl group in a 
carbonyl compound is converted specifically and position-selectively into a vinyl 
group. In a typical procedure utilizing the Wittig reaction, as is described, for 
example, in Org. React., volume 14, page 270 (1965), an organic phosphonium 
compound is subjected to a treatment with a basic compound to form a 
phosphorane compound which is admixed and reacted with a carbonyl 
compound to give a mixture of an olefin compound and a phosphine oxide 
compound. Furthermore EP-A-0 241 335 discloses a method for the preparation of a 
compound which is useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of diene 
compounds by said Wittig reaction. The above mentioned process of the Wittig reaction, however, has a 
serious problem that, since the reaction mixture after the reaction contains the 
phosphine oxide compound as a by-product in  
 
an equimolar amount to the desired olefin compound, isolation of 
the desired olefin compound from the reaction mixture is very 
troublesome. In principle, the olefin compound can be separated 
from the phosphine oxide compound by filtration. Difficulties are 
encountered, however, in practicing the filtration process in a 
large industrial scale because special and expensive facilities are 
required therefor and pollution of the working environment is 
more or less unavoidable to cause adverse influences on the workers' 
health. A method for facilitating separation of the phosphine oxide 
compound from the reaction mixture is known, in which the phosphine 
oxide compound is soluble in an aqueous alkali or acid solution 
when the phosphine compound of the formula Ph2PAr, in 
which Ph is a phenyl group and Ar is a group expressed by the formula 
C6H4COOH or -C6H4N(CH3)2, respectively, is used as the 
starting material in the reaction described in Chem. Ber., volume 
99, page 2663 (1966) and J. Chem. Soc., page 2130 (1961) or the so-called 
Wittig-Ho
