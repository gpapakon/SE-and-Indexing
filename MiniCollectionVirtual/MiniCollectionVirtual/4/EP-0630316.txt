<ABSTRACT>
Wrapped covering material (14), e.g. tape is applied around an elongate substrate (2), such as a pipe, using an apparatus comprising a hollow frame (2) mounted on rollers (12) that is rotatable about the substrate (2), a delivery device for holding the covering material, mounted on the frame, and pressure rollers (18, 20) designed to press down on the covering material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for applying a
wrapped covering material around an elongate substrate or around a joint
between such substrates, and in particular to a method for
applying tape or a wraparound sleeve around joints
between pipes in a void-free manner.It is well known to wrap covering material around elongate
substrates such as pipes or cables or joints therebetween in order to
provide a protective coating, for example against corrosion or mechanical
abuse or other environmental factors. One common example where a
protective coating is required is where metal pipelines, factory coated with
a thin polymeric outer layer (known as a mill coating), are joined by
welding in the field. The mill coating is traditionally a sintered or
extruded polyethylene layer. More recently multi layer coatings
comprising sequentially a fusion bonded epoxy layer, a hot melt adhesive
layer and an outer polyethylene layer have become popular. Typical mill
coatings are 1.5 to 9 mm thick. In order to form the weld, the mill coating,
whatever its nature, must first be removed. This means that after the
welding there is a bare pipe portion around the weld that needs to be
protected. Solutions to this involve wrapping tape e.g. polymeric tape, or
a wraparound polymeric sleeve around the bare portion. Where a
wraparound sleeve is used this may be heat recoverable (preferably heat
shrinkable), and may be closed around the pipeline by an adhesive coated
patch closure as described for example in US-4359504, EP-B-0023788 and EP-B-0163508
(MP227, MP296, B104), and as also described, for example, in
Raychem's WPC (Wraparound Pipe Sleeve) installation instructions. By a
heat recoverable article is meant one whose dimensional configuration
may be made to change when subjected to an appropriate treatment.
Usually these articles recover, on heating, towards an original shape from
which they have previously been deformed, but the term "heat
recoverable" also includes an article which, on heating, adopts a new 
configuration, even if it has not been previously deformed. Typically
heat-recoverable articles comprise a radially heat-shrinkable sleeve
exhibiting the property of elastic or plastic memory, as described, for
example, in US-A-2027962, US-A-3086242 and US-A-3597372.In order to achieve good bonding of the tape or sleeve to the
pipeline it is known to preheat the substrate (in the case of an applied heat
recoverable tape or sleeve) or to use epoxy primers applied to the pipeline
before application of the sleeve or tape as

<CLAIMS>
A method of applying a wrapped covering material around a welded joint
between two coated metal pipes (2) bared of coating in the region of the weld

(4) said method comprising:

(a) positioning an apparatus comprising

(i) a hollow frame (10) which can be positioned around the joint, and
which is mounted on two or more wheels or rollers (12) that, in use can

be rolled around the joint;
(ii) a covering material delivery device (14) mounted on the frame, for
receiving a wraparound covering material coated with an adhesive

having a tack temperature and for delivering the adhesive-coated
covering material onto a surface of the joint as the frame is rotated;

at least two pressure rollers (18, 20) which are arranged to press
radially inward onto the delivered covering material as the frame is

rotated; and a heater for heating the adhesive-coated covering material
before it contacts the pressure rollers,

said positioning being such that the frame surrounds the joint and
wheels,
(b) mounting the adhesive-coated covering material in the delivery device;
(c) pre-heating the adhesive-coated covering material with the heater; 
(d) rotating the frame relative to the joint thereby delivering the covering
material and causing the pressure rollers to press radially downward on

the covering material

characterized in that

i) the frame is arranged to rotate about the joint in a
circumferential manner;
(ii) a first pressure roller (18) is arranged to press against the weld
region and a second pressure roller (20) is arranged to act on a

transition region between the pipe coating and the bared region
of the pipe;
(iii) the joint is preheated to 130° to 170°C;
(iv) the adhesive-coated covering is pre-heated to about the tack

temperature of the adhesive; and
(v) the frame is rotated circumferentially relative to the joint so to
cause the first pressure roller to press down radially on the

covering material in the weld region and the second pressure
roller to press down radially on the transition region.
2. A method according to Claim 1 wherein at least one of the pressure rollers (18,
20) has a bevelled surface facing the pipes, to conform to irregularities in the

pipe surface.
