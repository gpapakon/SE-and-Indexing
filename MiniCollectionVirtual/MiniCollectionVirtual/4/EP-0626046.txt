<ABSTRACT>
A linear moving device (10) with overload protection consists of a controllable drive (12) with a spindle shaft (14) integral in rotation therewith, at least one direct contact component in engagement with said spindle and a linearly movable carriage supporting it. Here, the direct contact component consists preferably of two worm wheels (20, 22) arranged on either side of and engaging with the spindle shaft (14). These worm wheels are rotationally fixed in the longitudinally guided carriage (16) and an overload protective device is allocated to them by means of which the worm wheels (20, 22) rotate when an adjustable overload torque occurs and halt the carriage (16). Together with the longitudinal axis of the spindle shaft (14), the worm wheels (20, 22) preferably form a plane, while their axes of rotation lie on a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spindle (14). This novel, linear moving device is thus both simply and economically constructed and provides a completely solid structure while, in addition, ensuring proper operation meeting safety requirements in all respects. In addition, its design is extremely low and it is therefore particularly suitable for stair-lifts.

A linear moving device with overload protection, 
comprising a controllable drive (12), a spindle shaft (14) 

rotatably connected therewith, at least two gears (20, 22) 
arranged either side of the spindle shaft and engaged 

therewith, and a linearly movable, longitudinally guided 
carriage (16), which accommodates the gears and in which the 

gears are mounted via bearing journals (18), the overload 
protection comprising one or two friction discs (24, 26), 

which is/are associated with both gears and are pressed by 
means of a spring element with a contact pressure against 

the gears, so that for linear operation the gears are 
rotationally rigidly mounted in the carriage, characterised 

in that the gears are constructed as worm gears (20, 22), 
and the friction disc is pressed by the spring element (19), 

whose contact force is adjustable, against one end face of 
each worm gear with a defined contact pressure, so that in 

the presence of an overload moment the worm gears rotate 
causing the carriage to be stationary. 
A linear moving device according to claim 1, in which 
the worm gears form a plane with the longitudinal axis of 

the spindle shaft and in which the rotational axes of the 
worm gears lie on a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal 

axis of the spindle shaft. 
A linear moving device according to claim 1 or 2, in 
which an adjustable spring element (19) is associated with 

each worm gear. 
A linear moving device according to claim 3, in which a 
further friction disc (26) is arranged at the other end face 

of the worm gears, and in which a screw (18') is adjustably 
screwed into each bearing journal (18) carrying a worm gear, 

the screw (18') generating the defined contact pressure for 
the friction discs via the associated spring element (19).  

 
A stair lift with at least one linear moving device 
according to one of claims 1 to 4, which comprises a 

platform (40) with adjustable ramps (32, 33) on both sides 
and a rear wall (35), characterised in that the moving 

device (10) is fitted in the rear wall (35) for the upward 
or inward folding of the ramps (32, 33). 
A stair lift according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the moving device (10) is secured in said rear wall 

(35) approximately in the horizontal direction and its 
carriage (16) is articulatedly connected to a cross lever 

(42) pivotably mounted at the lower end of the rear wall 
(35), the cross lever (42) having a steering connection via 

a guide track (43) with a cam lever (44) on each side, a 
transmission rod system (46) supported by the cam lever 

causing the ramp (32) secured to the transmission rod system 
(46) to be folded upwards or downwards. 
A stair lift according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the cross lever (42), which is pivotably mounted at the 

lower end of the rear wall (35) and is articulatedly 
connected at its upper end to the carriage (16), is arranged 

in such a manner that, in its vertical position, the 
carriage (16) which is associated with the cross lever (42) 

is located in the centre of said cross lever (42), viewed in 
the longitudinal direction of the spindle shaft (14), and 

the ramps (32, 33) arranged on the left and right-hand sides 
of the cross lever (42) are folded upwards, and, proceeding 

from this position, the cross lever (42) can be pivoted into 
one or the oth
er end position of the spindle shaft (14), a 
folding downwards of the corresponding ramps (32, 33) being 

effected by means of the cam levers (44) and the guide 
tracks (43) provided in the cam levers and guiding the cross 

lever (42). 
A stair lift according to claim 7, characterised in 
that locking elements (49) are associated with the cross  

 
lever (42) and secure the cross lever (42) against 

displacement when both ramps (32, 33) are folded upwards. 
A stair lift with at least one linear moving device 
according to one of claims 1 to 4, which comprises a 

platform (40) with adjustable ramps (32, 33) on both sides 
and a rear wall (35), the platform (40) being articulatedly 

connected to the rear wall (35) and being foldable upwards 
or inwards towards the rear wall, characterised in that the 

moving device (10) is provided on the rear wall (35) for the 
upward or inward folding of the platform (40). 
A stair lift according to claim 9, characterised in 
that, for the upward and inward folding of the platform 

(40), the moving device (10) and a gas pressure spring (50) 
supporting the moving device (10) are integrated in the 

platform (40), both being pivotably mounted on the rear wall 
(35) and during displacement an upward or downward folding 

of the platform (40) pivotably mounted on the rear wall (35) 
being effected by the carriage (16) of the moving device and 

a piston rod (58) of the gas pressure spring (50).
