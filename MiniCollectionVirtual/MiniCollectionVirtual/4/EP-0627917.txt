In a first embodiment, the cytoprotective composition comprises (a) pyruvate selected from the group consisting of pyruvic acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of pyruvic acid, and35 mixtures thereof, and (b) an antioxidant. In a second embodiment, the cytoprotective composition comprises pyruvate selected from the group consisting of pyruvic acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of pyruvic acid, and mixtures thereof, (b) an antioxidant, and (c) a40 mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids wherein

The cytoprotective compositions may be incorporated into a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to prepare pharmaceutical products. This invention also relates to methods for preparing and using the cytoprotective compositions and the pharmaceutical products in which the cytoprotective compositions may be used.Description of the BackgroundCancer is a group of neoplastic diseases affecting different organs and systems in the body. A common feature in all cancers is cellular mutation and abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth usually at a rate greater than that of normal body cells. Neither the etiology of cancer nor the manner in which cancer causes death is completely understood.Significant advances have been made in the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. Most anticancer agents act at specific phases of the cell cycle and are therefore only active against cells in the process of division. Although differences in the duration of the cell cycle occur between different types of cells, all cells show a similar pattern during the division process which may be characterized as follows: (1) a presynthetic phase; (2) a DNA synthesis phase; (3) a postsynthetic phase following termination of DNA synthesis; and (4) a mitosis phase, wherein the cell containing a double complement of DNA divides into two daughter cells. Most anti-neoplastic agents act specifically on processes such as the DNA synthesis phase, the
