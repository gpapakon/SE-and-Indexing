<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for delivering metered quantities of a 
fluid substance (B) into a container (24A), under the 

control of a programmable process unit (23), and a 
weighing device (24). The apparatus comprises a main 

storage tank (25) to fill by gravity a pressurisable 
auxiliary vessel (26) connected to the inlet (12) of 

delivery valves (13, 14, 15) having different flow 
rates; the process unit (23) is programmed to 

modulate the flow rates and to control the delivery 
time of the valves (13, 14, 15) as a function of 

control signals received from a weighing device (24). 
The auxiliary vessel (26) is hermetically sealed and 

connected to air pressure source (31, 32), to provide 
a constant pneumatic head in the vessel (26) under 

the control of the process unit (23), at each 
delivery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
delivering fluid substances in metered quantities 
according to precharacterising part of claim 1, 
wherein metering is performed by weight control of 
the delivered substance. The invention is above all 
applicable in the preparation of dyeing agents used 
in printing or dye works although other applications 
are possible for which accurate controls and extreme 
precision of the delivered quantities of fluid 
substances having high viscosity, are required. In preparing colouring or dyeing substances, 
particularly for dyeing works, fluid components are 
used as a basis for a dyeing substance which must be 
mixed together in metered quantities, strictly 
observing the required tolerances. Generally use is 
made of special delivering devices provided with 
motor-driven valves, to carry out weight control by 
modulating the flow rates of components and  
 
controlling the delivery times of the valves. In general the flow rate may be modulated by 
appropriately varying the outflow from a valve, or by 
providing separate delivery valves having different 
flow rates; the valves are sequentially opened for 
predetermined lengths of time, under the control of a 
programmable process unit which receives control 
signals from a weighing device. In weight metering systems which make use of flow 
modulating valves, wherein the weight is controlled 
by gradually reducing the flow of the substance to be 
metered, the final adjustment of the weight is the 
most delicate phase, in that it can be easily 
affected by many external factors, such as the 
viscosity of the fluid, temperature and, mainly, 
pressure or hydraulic head acting on the delivery 
device. In traditional apparatus, in which the substances are 
simply delivered by gravity, the delivery device is 
directly connected to a storage tank of adequate 
capacity, positioned at a predetermined height above 
the delivering device on a support structure. Since  
 
the flow rate delivered by the device is a direct 
function of the hydraulic head which acts on the 
delivery device itself, clearly in systems of this 
kind considerable variations in flow may occur, 
particularly in the final weight adjustment phase, 
given that the hydraulic head changes as the filling 
conditions of the storage tank vary. In systems of this kind constant care and attention 
is required to prevent excessive lowering of the 
level of fluid in the storage tank, without 
nevertheless eliminating the inherent limitations and 
defects of
