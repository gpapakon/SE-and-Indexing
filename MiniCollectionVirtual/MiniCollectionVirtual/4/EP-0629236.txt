<ABSTRACT>
Methods, compositions and devices are provided for the growth of human stem and/or hematopoietic cells in culture. Bioreactors (106) are provided in which diverse cell types are simultaneously-cultured in the presence of appropriate levels of nutrients and growth factors substantially continuously maintained in the bioreactor (106) while removing undesirable metabolic products. This simultaneous culture of multiple cell types successfully reconstructs hematopoietic tissue ex vivo. Optionally, at least one growth factor is provided through excretion by transfected stromal cells, particularly heterologous cells. Means are provided for maintaining the stromal cells (112) and hematopoietic cells (110) separately, and to allow for harvesting of both the adherent (110, 112) and non-adherent cells (114).

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is methods and devices for the
growth of normal mammalian cells in culture, including the
maintenance and selective growth of human stem and/or
hematopoietic cells.There is significant interest in the ability to use cells
for a wide variety of therapeutic purposes. The hematopoietic
system exemplifies the extraordinary range of cells involved
in protection of mammalian hosts from pathogens, toxins,
neoplastic cells, and other diseases. The hematopoietic
system is believed to evolve from a single stem cell, from
which all the lineages of the hematopoietic system derive.
The particular manner in which the stem cell proliferates and
differentiates to become determined in its lineage is not
completely understood, nor are the factors defined. However,
once the stem cell has become dedicated to a particular
lineage, there appear to be a number of factors, for example
colony stimulating factors, which allow, and may direct the
stem cell to a particular mature cell lineage.There are many uses for blood cells. Platelets find use 
in protection against hemorrhagings an well an a source of
platelet derived growth factor. Red blood cells can find use
in transfusions to support the transport of oxygen. Specific
lymphocytes may find application in the treatment of various
diseases, where the lymphocyte is specifically sensitized to
an epitome of an antigen. Stem cells may be used for genetic
therapy as well as for rescue from high dose cancer
chemotherapy. These and many other purposes may be
contemplated.In order to provide these cells, it will be necessary to
provide a means, whereby cells can be grown in culture and
result in the desired mature cell, either prior to or after
administration to a mammalian host. The hematopoietic cells
are known to grow and mature to varying degrees in bone, as
part of the bone marrow. It therefore becomes of interest to
recreate a system which provides substantially the same
environment as is encountered in the bone marrow, as well as
being able to direct these cells which are grown in culture to
a specific lineage.In this vein, U.S. Patent No. 4,721,096 describes a
3-dimensional system involving stromal cells for the growth of
hematopoietic cells. See also the references cited therein.
