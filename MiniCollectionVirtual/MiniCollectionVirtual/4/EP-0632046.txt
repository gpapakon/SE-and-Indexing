<ABSTRACT>
The present invention makes available alkanephosphonic acid alkoxylates of the general formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 where X = H, CH3 or C2H5 and R = CnH2n+1, CnH2n-1 (cyclic or open-chain), n being an integer from 1 to 8 and m = 1 to 5 and s + t = m. These alkanephosphonic acid alkoxylates are accessible by reaction of the corresponding alkanephosphonic acids with alkylene oxides. The novel alkanephosphonic acid alkoxylates are particularly suitable as flame-retarding agents in the textile and plastics industries.
