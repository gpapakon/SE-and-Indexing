<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electric motor with a metal casing associated with a control circuit, the components of which are mounted on a printed circuit card (4). At least one of these components is an integrated circuit (7) which comprises inhibition means acting when its temperature exceeds a predetermined value. This integrated circuit is mounted in such a way that its face opposite the printed circuit constitutes the surface which projects furthest among the components mounted on the printed circuit. The printed circuit is mounted on one wall (3) of the casing in such a way that the projecting face of the integrated circuit bears against the said wall.

<CLAIMS>
An electric motor, the external aspect of which
is that of a metal casing (1), a rotation shaft (2) of the motor

protruding from at least one side of the casing, this motor being
associated with an electronic control circuit, the components

(6a, 6b) of which are assembled on a printed circuit board (4),
characterized in that:


at least one of said components is an integrated
circuit (7) including means for inhibition when its temperature

exceeds a predetermined value,
the integrated circuit (7) is assembled so that its
surface opposite to the printed circuit (4) protrudes most among

the components mounted on the printed circuit, and
the printed circuit (4) is mounted on a wall (3) of
said casing (1) so that said surface of the integrated circuit

(7) bears against said wall and is in direct contact therewith.
The electric motor of claim 1, wherein the
printed circuit is screwed to the wall (3), the screws (9) being

arranged so that said surface of the integrated circuit (7) is
applied against the wall by the effect of the resilience of the

printed circuit board (4).
The electric motor of claim 1, further including
an insulating protection plate (10) assembled facing the printed

circuit board (4) on the side opposite to the wall (3).
The electric motor of claim 1, wherein the wall
(3) is located on the side opposite to that from which the rotation

shaft (2) of the motor protrudes.
Use of the motor of any of claims 1 to 4 as a
motor for driving a coaxial turbine which is peripheral to this

motor.
