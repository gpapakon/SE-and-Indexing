<ABSTRACT>
A surgical needle (10) is disclosed which is made up of two 
concentric 

tubes (12,14). The inner tube (12) has a sharp tip (18) like a 
conventional 

hypodermic or intravenous needle. The inner tube (12) can be 
retracted into 

the outer tube (14) after use. In one embodiment, the needle (10) 
forms part of a 

catheter assembly. A catheter (24) is mounted coaxially around 
the both tubes 

(12,14). The inner tube (12) has a latching member attached to the 
end without the 

sharp tip (18). The latching member engages detents on a housing to 
hold the sharp 

tip (18) in an extended position or a retracted position. The latching member 
is provided with a porous plug to assist in venting gases during catheter introduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical needles. More specifically, it relates to a catheter 
introduction device equipped with a needle shielding feature to shield the needle after 
withdrawal of the needle from the blood vessel. With the proliferation of the AIDS virus, attention has increasingly focused on the 
transmission of blood borne pathogens from infected to healthy people. The transmission 
of blood borne pathogens through needle-stick injuries has received special attention. Several devices have been proposed for the shielding of surgical needles after use. 
For catheter introducer needles, such shields have been in the form of sheaths which 
attach to the needle hub (e.g. McDonald's U.S. Patent No. 4,834,718, Luther et al.'s U.S. 
Patent No. 4,762,516) and sheaths which attach to a stop on the needle (e.g. Lopez's U.S. 
Patent No. 4,778,453, Vanderhoof's U.S. Patent No. 4,846,811). These devices prevent 
the sheath from sliding off the end of the needle by restraining the rear of the sheath. 
Other device include a barrier which prevents the sheath from being pulled back to 
expose the needle tip (e.g. Kulli's U.S. Patent No. 4,929,241). In the cited references, a 
conventional needle is shielded by a separate sliding sheath. In contrast, the present 
invention focuses on the design of the needle and involves a redesigned needle which 
incorporates a sheath. The invention is a surgical needle having two coaxial tubes. One tube is fixed to a 
housing and the other is slidable relative to the housing. The inner tube has a sharp tip.  
 
When the needle is used to penetrate the body, the sharp tip protrudes from the outer tube 
and the inner tube is held in place by a latch. Once the needle has been used, the inner 
tube is withdrawn into the outer tube and latched into a shielded position. The sharp tip 
is thus shielded by the outer tube. Figure 1A is a partially cut away view of the needle of the present invention in a 
first position in which the sharp tip of the needle protrudes from the outer tube; Figure 1B is a partially cut away view of the needle of the present invention in 
which the sharp tip of the needle is shielded by the outer tube; Figure 2 is a perspective view of an embodiment of the invention in which the 
needle forms part of a catheter introducer assembly; Figure 3 is a partially cut away perspective view of the embodiment of Figure 2; Figure 4 is a perspective view of the latch member of the invention showing a 
flash back plug. The distal end of needle 10 is shown in Fig.

<CLAIMS>
A surgical needle assembly comprising: a housing; a first tube having a 
longitudinal axis, a proximal end and a distal end, the distal end having a sharp tip, the 

first tube being moveable relative to the housing; a second tube secured to the housing 
and having a proximal end and a distal end, the second tube being mounted coaxially 

around the first tube and extending substantially along the length of the first tube such 
that in a first position the sharp tip protrudes from the distal end of the second tube and in 

a second position the sharp tip is shielded by the distal end of the second tube; means for 
moving the first tube relative to the second tube along the longitudinal axis from the first 

position to the second position.

mounted to the first tube and interactive with the housing, for latching the first tube 

relative to the second tube in the first and second positions. 
The needle assembly of Claim 2 wherein the latching means comprises a 
first detent in the housing for holding the first tube in the first position and a second 

detent in the housing for holding the first tube in the second position.

resilient member for locking the first tube in the second position. 
The needle assembly of Claim 1, further comprising a catheter cannula 
mounted coaxially around the second tube. 
A catheter introducer assembly comprising: 
   a housing, a first tube having a longitudinal axis, a proximal end and a 

distal end, the distal end having a sharp tip, the first tube being moveable relative to the 
housing; a second tube secured to the housing and having a proximal end and a distal end, 

the second tube being mounted coaxially around the first tube and extending substantially 
along the length of the first tube such that in a first position the sharp tip protrudes from 

the distal end of the second tube and in a second position the sharp tip is shielded by the 
distal end of the second tube; a catheter cannula mounted coaxially around the second 

 
tube; means for moving the first tube relative to the 
second tube along the longitudinal 
axis from the first position to the second position; first detent means in the housing for 

holding the first tube in the first position; second detent means in the housing for holding 
the first tube in the second position. 
The catheter introducer assembly of Claim 6 further comprising a latching 
member mounted to the first tube, the latching member comprising means for engaging 

the first and second detent means.
