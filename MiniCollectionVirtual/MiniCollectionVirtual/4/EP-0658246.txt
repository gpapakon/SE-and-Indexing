<ABSTRACT>
A system using a printer (13) with a fuser-heater (15) has control means for turning off the fuser-heater (15) during times when no printing is required, while leaving the rest of the printing system operable. Time (tWI) between print requests is monitored (step 41), and the fuser-heater (15) is turned off when a preset time is reached without a print request (step 45). A next request (INIT) turns the fuser-heater (15) back on again (step 31). Data is accepted at a reduced rate while a heater warms up (step 35).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of apparatus and
methods for controlling a nonimpact laser printer or
laser-type printer, and has particular application as a
power saving device.As printing technology becomes more sophisticated
and printers more capable of producing text and graphics
with quality that is acceptable for almost any intended
application, printers are becoming more available to all
computer users. The most popular printer for its ease of
use and quiet, dependable operation is the laser-type
electrostatic printer, which produces a superior print
quality and is faster and quieter than printer types that
predate it, such as the dot matrix, daisy wheel, thermal,
and ink-jet. For purposes of this specification printers
that write on a drum by LED or LCD instead of a laser, and
use a fuser-heater to fuse toner to the paper, are
included as laser-type printers.The laser-type printer uses a mechanism similar to
that of a photocopy machine. The image is written on a
photosensitive drum by a laser in the case of a laser
printer. In other printers the image is written by an LED
bar or an LCD shutter. Toner is attracted to the areas on
the drum that have been written. The toner is then heated
by the fuser-heater to fuse it to the paper to produce the
printout. Because laser-type printers print an entire
page at a time and the drum may be scanned quickly, they
are much faster than most other printer types. Typically
such a printer has an electronic buffer that can store a
page or several pages of data depending on the amount of
memory it has available for use. In a network comprising 
several computers and printers, printer buffers are
inclined to be rather large and a network server, if
present, usually means that a more than adequate amount of
memory is available. A print request sent by a computer
is received by the printer buffer and scheduled for
printing, which typically commences when the buffer
contains a full page and a "not busy" message is received
from the printer. The process of printing is one of
processing pages sent by the computer to the printer that
are held in the printer's buffer. If the amount of
material being sent to the printer is greater than the
size of the buffer, the host computer is forced to hold
until the buffer is cleared and can again accept print
input, and so on until all pages are printed.In a typical working environment, the printers are
left on all the time as a convenience to users and are
consequently consuming power in order to keep the fuser-heater
at the proper

A system for operating a printer (13) having a fuser-heater (15)
comprising:


means (26) for initializing the printer (13) by turning
on the fuser-heater (15) and printer circuitry, and

readying the printer (13) to accept print requests and
data;
means (27) for transmitting a print request and
data to be printed to the printer (13);
means (29) for ascertaining, when a print request
is received, whether the printer (13) is initialized, and

if it is, whether the fuser-heater (15) is off, on but
not at operating temperature, or on and at operating

temperature;
means (31) for turning the fuser-heater (15) on in
response to the condition that a print request and

data is received, the printer (13) is initialized, and
the fuser-heater (15) is off;
means (35) for limiting the data acceptance rate at
the printer (13) to a rate less than the maximum rate in

response to the printer (13) being initialized and the
fuser-heater (15) being on and not at operating

temperature, and accepting data at maximum rate (37) in
response to the printer (13) being initialized and the

fuser-heater (15) being on and at operating temperature;
means (41) for measuring time in response to the
condition that the printer (13) is initialized, a print

request and data is received, and the fuser-heater (15)
is on and at operating temperature, the measured

time reset to zero each time a print request is
received; and
means (45) for turning off the fuser-heater when
the measured time reaches a preset maximum time

without being reset to zero.
A system as in claim 1 further comprising user

A system as in column 1 comprising a plurality of
computers (25) connected to one another and to at least one

printer (13) by a data transmission link (23) operating on a network
protocol.
