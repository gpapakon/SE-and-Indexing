<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transdermal or 
interdermal drug delivery devices for delivering a liquid 
drug to a subject via the subject's skin. The invention is 
particularly useful with respect to the drug delivery device 
described in our Patent No.5,156,591, and is therefore 
described below with respect to that device, but it will be 
appreciated that the invention could advantageously be used 
in other types of drug delivery devices. Our Patent No.5,156,591 describes a transdermal 
drug delivery device which delivers a drug to the subject by 
means of an electrically-induced mass transfer phenomenon 
called iontophoresis. This process for drug delivery has 
recently become of great interest, and many such transdermal 
delivery devices have been described in the patent 
literature, including US Patents 4,164,226, 4,640,689, 
4,708,716, 4,752,285, 4,693,711, 5,057,072, US Statutory 
Invention Registration H516, and European Patent Application 
Publication 0299631. Other methods of electrically-aided or 
electrically-controlled transdermal drug delivery devices 
are described in US Patent 4,886,513, as well as in our 
prior US Patents 5,062,834 and 5,090,963. A device for transdermal administration of drugs using solid 
skin needles is known from EP-A-429 842. The solid skin 
needles of EP-A-429 842 do not conduct liquid through their 
interior. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a drug delivery device for delivering a liquid drug 
to a subject via the subject's skin, comprising: a housing; 
a liquid reservoir in the housing for a liquid drug to be 
delivered;, and a drug delivery body of resilient deformable material 
carried by the housing 
and having one side communicating with one side of the 
liquid reservoir, and the opposite side exposed to engage 
the skin of the subject to receive the drug; characterized 
in that the drug delivery body includes a plurality of 
hollow stiff 
tubular elements extending through the body, each having an 
inlet end communicating with the liquid reservoir, and an 
outlet end at said opposite side of the drug delivery body 
to conduct the liquid drug directly to said opposite side.  
 The plurality of stiff tubular elements may be in 
the form of hollow needles having inner diameters of less 
than 1 mm and projecting at least 0.1 mm from the face of 
the drug delivery body. Preferably, the drug delivery body 
includes at least fifty of such stiff tubular elements or 
hollow needles. Their tips may be cut at a bias to pierce 
the outer layer
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A drug delivery device (2) for delivering a liquid 
drug to a subject via the subject's skin, comprising: 


a housing (4); 
a liquid reservoir (24) in said housing (4) for a 
liquid drug to be delivered; and 
a drug delivery body (10; 50) of resilient deformable 
material carried by said housing (4) and having one side 

communicating with one side of the liquid reservoir (24), 
and the opposite side exposed to engage the skin of the 

subject to receive the drug; 
 
   characterized in that said drug delivery body (10; 50) 

includes a plurality of hollow stiff tubular elements (26) 
extending through the body (1
0; 50), each having an inlet 
end (26a) communicating with said liquid reservoir (24), and 

an outlet end (26b) at said opposite side of the drug 
delivery body (10; 50) to conduct the liquid drug directly 

to said opposite side. 
The device according to claim 1, further including 
control means (12, 28, 30) for controlling the rate of 

delivery of the drug from said reservoir (24) via said 
plurality of stiff tubular elements (26) extending through 

the drug delivery body (10; 50). 
The device according to claim 2, wherein said 
control means (12, 28, 30) includes a first displaceable 

membrane (12) for controlling the pressure in said reservoir 
(24) in order to control the rate of feed of the liquid from 

the reservoir (24) via said tubular elements (26) to the 
subject's skin. 
The device according to claim 3, 
wherein said drug delivery body (10; 50) is in the form of a 

second displaceable membrane (10) through which said  
 

plurality of stiff tubular elements (26) extend and 
displaceable by the pressure in said reservoir (24). 
The device according to claims 3 or 4, wherein said 
control means (12, 28, 30) further includes an electrolytic 

cell (30) capable of generating a gas to displace said first 
displaceable membrane (12) corresponding to the electrical 

current applied to the electrolytic cell (30). 
The device according to one or more of claims 2-5, 
wherein said control means (12, 28, 30) includes a partition 

(60) between the liquid reservoir (24) and the drug delivery 
body (50) and formed with a metering orifice (64) for 

metering the flow of the drug from the reservoir (24) to 
said drug delivery body (50). 
The device according to one or more of claims 1-6, 
wherein said housing (4) further includes a first electrode 

(36) exposed for contact with the skin of a subject, and a 
second electrode (38) in contact with the liquid drug in 

said reservoir (24). 
The device according one or more of claims 1-7, 
wherein said plurality of stiff tubular elements (26) have 

inner diameters of less than 1 mm. 
The device according one or more of claims 1-8, 
wherein said plurality of stiff tubular elements (26) are 

hollow needles of metal coated externally with insulation. 
The device according to one or more of claims 1-9, 
wherein said drug delivery body (10; 50) includes at least 

50 of said stiff tubular elements (26).
