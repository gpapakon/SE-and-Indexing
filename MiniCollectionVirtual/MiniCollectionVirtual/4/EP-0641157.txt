Machine for destroying banana plantation debris, of the type having a 
wheel-mounted automotive chassis (A, A') of which at least two wheels are 

drive wheels and at least one is a steering wheel, characterized in that it 
comprises, from the front to the back in the direction of operation: 


a shield (B) for pushing over uncut false trunks, 
and a tunnel chassis (2, 2a) which, having a cross section in the form of 
an upside down U, is connected to the automotive chassis (A, A') w
ith 
interposition of means (15, 19; 15, 87) for adjusting its level and tilting the 

cutting plane of the inertial grinder that it supports with respect to the 
horizontal, 
this tunnel chassis having, at the upper part, a means (25) for 
rotationally driving a shaft (28) that is substantially vertical, at the lower end of 

which is wedged an inertial flywheel (35) and at its median part a fixed bearing 
(39-40) for an intermediate shaft (38), coaxial with the first and whose upper 

end is connected rotationally to inertial flywheel (35) while, on its lower end is 
wedged a circular plate (47) bearing at least two cutting blades (49) mounted 

freely rotationally on pivots (48). 
Machine according to Claim 1 characterized in that shield (B) is 
disposed in front of automotive chassis (A), this automotive chassis being a 

farm tractor, whose two lower lateral connecting rods (15) are each connected 
to one of two gussets (13) of the tunnel chassis and whose upper central 

hitching point is connected to a hitching pin (18) of tunnel chassis (2) by a 
double-acting hydraulic jack (19). 
Machine according to either of Claims 1 and 2 characterized in that 
tunnel chassis (2) is associated with a towed roller (72) for protection against 

ejected matter, the ends of the horizontal shaft (74) of which roller are attached, 
freely rotationally, to the rear ends of two levers (75) articulated by their front 

ends, and by (77) behind tunnel chassis (2). 
Machine according to anyone of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
tunnel chassis (2) rests on the ground by means of lengthwise skids (9) each 

provided with at least two risers (10) positioned on one of the spars of the 
chassis by removable transverse pins (12) passing through one of the openings 

with which they are provided.  
 
Machine according to anyone of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
tunnel chassis rests on the ground by means of lengthwise skids (9) each 

provided with a perforated anterior riser (10a) articulated around a removable 
transverse pin (12) attached to a bearing of the tunnel chassis and passing 

through one of the openings in this riser and with a posterior riser (10b) 
connected to means able to adjust its position relative to tunnel chassis (2). 
Machine according to Claim 5, characterized in that the means 
regulating the positions of risers (lob) relative to the ground and determining the 

cutting angle of the grinder have on the one hand, above tunnel chassis (2), a 
double-acting hydraulic jack (60) articulated on a clevis (62) on the chassis and 

at the end of a lever (63) joined to a transverse shaft (64) and on the other hand 
two levers (66) joined to the ends of transverse shaft (64) which project beyond 

tunnel chassis (2) and, moreover, two connecting rods (67) each connecting one 
of levers (66) to the rear riser (10b) of the corresponding support skid. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that tunnel chassis (2a) 
is hitched behind a farm tractor A', while shield (B) is at an adjustable 

inclination and is articulated to the edge of tunnel chassis (2a) which is in front 
of it relative to the direction of operation corresponding to movement of the 

tractor in reverse. 
Machine according to claim 7 characterized in that the central, upper 
hitching tie rod (82) of the three-point hitch of the tractor is articulated to an 

attachment plate (83) which is attached to a frame (85) and has at least one bore 
for articulation of the body of a hydraulic jack (87) for adjustment of the 

inclination of the tunnel chassis, the rod of said jack being articulated to another 
frame (90) projecting from the other end of the tunnel chassis. 
Machine according to either of claims 7 or 8, characterized in that 
shield (B) has a transverse wall (93) from which project two lateral guide spurs 

(94) disposed thereon forming a "V" that converges in the direction of the 
grinder. 
Machine according to anyone of claims 7 to 9, characterized in that 
shield (B) is articulated to tunnel chassis (2a) to which it is connected by at least 

one hydraulic jack (97) for adjusting its inclination. 
Machine according to anyone of claims 7 to 10, characterized in that 
tunnel chassis (2a) rests on the ground by means of two lengthwise skids (98) 

each provided with protective flanges (99), a riser (100) articulated around a  
 

removable transverse pin (102), which is attached to a riser (103) of chassis 
(2a), and a clevis (104) for articulation of the rod of hydraulic jack (105) whose 

body is articulated to tunnel chassis (2a). 
Machine according to claim 2 or 7, characterized in that the drive pin 
(22) of tractor (A or A') is connected to the input shaft (24) of a angular 

transfer, speed multiplier element (25), via a telescopic trasnmission shaft (23) 
having double cardan joints, with interposition of torque limiting means (26) 

and of a ratchet mechanism (27) enabling the tra,smission of movement only in 
the direction from the drive pin to the angluar trasnfer element. 
Machine according to claim 2 or 7, characterized in that the means for 
driving the inertial flywheel (35) are comprised of a hydraulic motor supplied 

from a hydraulic pump mounted on automotive chassis (A) and driven by the 
thermal engine of this chassis.
