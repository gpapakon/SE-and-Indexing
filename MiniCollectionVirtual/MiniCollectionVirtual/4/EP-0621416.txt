<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shock-damping device comprising at least one mechanical element (1) which through its deformation absorbs the energy generated by a shock occurring in a given direction, characterised in that the said element is made up of thin plates (4, 5, 6), its cross-section situated in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the shock having the shape of at least two triangles (2, 3) each having a common apex. Application particularly to railway vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
An impact-absorber device comprising at least one mechanical 
member (1) absorbing by deformation the energy generated by an impact 

in a given direction characterized in that said member is made from 
thin plates (4, 5, 6) having normals perpendicular to the direction 

of impact, and having a cross-section in a plane perpendicular to the 
direction of impact in the shape of at least two triangles (2, 3) 

each having a common vertex, and in that the thickness of the plates 
(4, 5, 6) is calculated so that under the effect of an impact, the 

member (1) collapses concertina fashion by localized buckling of the 
plates (4, 5, 6). 
A device according to claim 1 characterized in that said member 
has strengthening members (11) disposed between the two triangles and 

in planes perpendicular to the direction of impact. 
A device according to claim 1 characterized in that said member 
has stamped areas (14). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in 
that the two triangles (1, 2) are identical and face in opposite 

directions. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterized in 
that said member (15) includes thin plates (16, 17) closing the 

inside corners between the two triangles (2, 3). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterized in 
that s
aid member is made of steel. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6 characterized in 
that said cross-section has parts with different yield stresses. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7 characterized in 
that said member is made from thin plates bent and welded together to 

form said cross-section.  
 
A vehicle characterized in that it includes in its framework at 
least one impact-absorber device according to any one of claims 1 to 

8 placed between undeformable parts of the framework. 
A vehicle according to claim 9 characterized in that the device 
is inserted into the chassis (25) of the vehicle. 
A vehicle according to claim 10 characterized in that, the 
chassis (25) comprising side sills (31, 32) and sole bars (36, 37), 

the device comprises members (38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45) substituted for 
the side sills and the sole bars of the chassis. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 9 to 11 characterized in 
that the chassis (25) includes an impact-absorber device (27) at the 

front of the vehicle, this device comprising a central member (75) on 
the vehicle axis and two lateral members (76, 77) disposed to form a 

V-shape pointing towards the front of the vehicle. 
A vehicle according to claim 12 characterized in that the lateral 
members (76, 77) have hollow rectangular transverse cross-sections 

with a single diagonal. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 10 to 13 characterized 
in that, being a rail vehicle having a rear crossbeam (35) and a 

pivot beam (34) corresponding to the adjacent bogie, the device is 
inserted into the chassis (25) between the rear crossbeam and said 

pivot beam.
