<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for determining at least one physical parameter such as the true plate thickness Pd, the apparent density Ds of the active mass, the true density Dw of the active mass, the pore volume Pv, the porosity Po or the pore structure of accumulator electrode plates, the procedure is such that the weight of a plate of a measuring liquid present instead of the actual electrode plate is determined by different weighings and the desired physical parameter is calculated therefrom and is used for controlling the manufacturing process.

Method for determining at least one physical parameter, such as

the true plate thickness (P
d
), the apparent density (D
s
) of the active
material, the true density (D
w
) of the active material, the pore
volume (P
v
) and/or the porosity (P
o
) of the active material and/or
the pore structure of accumulator electrode plates having a specific

area (F) which comprise a metal grid preferably made of lead
or lead alloy, having a weight (G
g
) and volume (V
g
), and a porous
active material arranged thereon, and which are designed for

functioning in an electrolyte such as sulphuric acid, characterised
in that


a) the weight (G
fl
) of a liquid having a previously known density
(ρ) is determined which is present in a container (11) up

to a particular liquid level (S),
b) the electrode plate is completely immersed into the liquid
arranged in the container (11),
c) the predetermined liquid level (S) in the container (11) is
adjusted when the immersed electrode plate is fully saturated

with liquid,
d) the weight (G
a
) of the contents of the container (11) is determined
in this state,
e) the liquid is let out of the container (11) so that only the
liquid impregnated electrode plate remains therein, 
f) the weight (G
b
) of the contents of the container is determined
in this state,
g) the difference (G
a
 - Gb) of the weight (G
a

d) and of the weight (G
b
) determined in step f) is calculated,
h) the difference (G
fl
- (G
a
 - Gb)) of the weight (G
a

from step a) and of the difference from step g) is formed,

which represents the weight (G
fp
) of a plate of the same area
(F) and the same liquid displacement with the density (ρ) of

the measurement liquid, when conceptionally set in place of
the electrode plate, and
i) the so formed weight (G
fp
) is used for the determination of
the physical parameter.
Method in accordance with claim 1,

characterised in that

a dry electrode plate is immersed into the liquid, preferably completely,
said liquid penetrating into the pores of the active material,

one then waits until at least a substantial saturation of the liquid
take up into the pores of the active material is achieved, and in

that subsequently, and optionally already during the sucking up of
liquid, liquid is added or let out continuously or in one or more

steps until the predetermined liquid level (S) is attained. 
Method in accordance with claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that

the weight (G
FP
) from step h) is divided by the density (ρ) of the liquid
and the area (F) of the electrode plate in order to calculate the

true plate thickness (P
d
).
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the electrode plate is introduced into the empty container (11) in a
dry state prior to the step a), and the dry weight (G
c
) of the contents
of the container (11) is then determined.
Method in accordance with claim 4,

characterised in that

the difference between the dry weight (G
c
) and the weight of the
grid (Gg) is formed, and is divided by the difference between the

weight (G
FP
) from step h) divided by the density (ρ) of the liquid and
the grid volume (V
g
) in order to obtain the apparent density (D
s
) of
the material.
Method in accordance with claim 5,

characterised in that

the difference between the weight (G
b
) from step f) and the weight
(G
c
) from claim 4 divided by the density (ρ) of the liquid is formed
as the pore volume (P
v
).
Method in accordance with claim 6,
 
characterised in that,

the pore volume (P
v
) is additionally taken away from the weight
(G
FP
) from step h) defined in claim 5 divided by the density (ρ) of
the liquid in order to obtain the true density (D
w
) of the material.
Method in accordance with claim 6,

characterised in that

the pore volume (P
v
) is calculated from the difference between the
weight (G
FP
) from step h) divided by the density (ρ) of the liquid and
the grid volume (V
g
) in order to obtain the porosity (P
o
).
Method in accordance with one of the claims 2 to 8,

characterised in that

the weight (G
d
) of the contents of the container (11) is also determined
a sufficiently short time after the immersion of a dry electrode

plate into the liquid at the desired liquid level (S) which is arrived
at by adding or removing liquid, that the pores of the active

material are initially partially filled with liquid; in that an apparent
short term porosity (P'
o
) is determined from this weight (G
d
) analogous
to claim 8, and in that a parameter is obtained which is characteristic

of the pore structure, for instance by calculating the
quotient of the short term porosity and the final porosity (P'
o
/P
o
).

control system (12). 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

lead-sulphuric acid accumulators.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
