<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to the use of glycosaminoglycans, chemically derivatized 
glycosaminoglycans, and optionally, chemically derivatized collagens to form ionically 

crosslinked gels useful in mammal soft tissue augmentation and in drug delivery systems. The 
derivatized glycosaminoglycans can be used to form an ionically homogeneous gel comprising 

one or more species of glycosaminoglycan derivative or can be used to form an ionically 
crosslinked heterogeneous gel comprising one or more negatively charged species of 

glycosaminoglycan or collagen derivative in combination with one or more positively charged 
species of glycosaminoglycan derivative or collagen derivative. 
The ionically crosslinked homogeneous or ionically crosslinked heterogeneous gels are 
produced from liquid solutions which upon adjusting pH 
in situ
 form a gel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to biocompatible, ionically crosslinked gels which 
comprise one or more species of glycosaminoglycans and/or derivatives of 
glycosaminoglycans: 1) ionically homogeneous gels containing one or more similarly charged 
species of glycosaminoglycan derivative, or 2) ionically heterogeneous gels containing two or 
more oppositely charged species of glycosaminoglycans, glycosaminoglycan derivatives, 
and/or collagen derivatives. The ionically crosslinked gels are useful in a number of medical 
applications, particularly as injectable compositions for soft tissue augmentation or drug 
delivery. A variety of different glycosaminoglycans are known. Examples of such include the 
chondroitin sulfates, keratan sulfate, keratosulfate, heparin, chitin, and hyaluronic acid. 
Compositions of these glycosaminoglycans are known to be useful in connection with the 
augmentation of soft tissue. Hyaluronic acid in particular has been used in various 
compositions for use in soil tissue augmentation. One example of such is disclosed by Balazs 
et al., Matrix Engineering, Blood Coagulations and Fibrinolysis, Volume 2, pages 173-178, 
1991, which discloses chemical modifications of hyaluronic acid, such as preparing hyaluronic 
acid gels by forming sulphonyl-bis-ethyl crosslinks between hydroxyl groups of the 
polysaccharide chains. Information regarding how hyaluronic acid and its derivatives interact 
within a biological system are also known, as disclosed by Balazs et al., Clinical Uses of 
Hyaluronin, Ciba Foundation Symposium 143, a Wiley-Interscience publication (1989) and by 
Doillon et al., Fibroblast Growth on a Porous Sponge Containing Hyaluronic Acid and  
 
Fibronectin, BioMaterials 8:195-200(1987). Various biocompatible viscoelastic gel slurries are disclosed within European patent 
application number 91303606.7, published January 15, 1992, which refers to various types of 
crosslinked polysaccharides useful in soil tissue augmentation. U.S. patent 4,378,017, issued March 29, 1983 to Kasugi et al., discloses combining 
fibrous nonsoluble collagen with deacetylated chitin to form an insoluble material. U.S. patent 4,448,718, issued May 15, 1984 to Yannas et al., discloses combining 
collagen with glycosaminoglycan and glutaraldehyde to form a crosslinked composite material. U.S. patent 4,451,397, issued May 29, 1984 to Huc et al., discloses mixing ground 
collagenous material, containing native crosslinked collagen in gel form, with 
glycosaminoglycan to form a gel. Hyaluronic
