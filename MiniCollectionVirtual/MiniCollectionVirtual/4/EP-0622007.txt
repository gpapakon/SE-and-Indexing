<ABSTRACT>
System for the fast road transportation of a cumbersome 
equipment comprising a first plate (11) coupled with the 

lifting unit and connected by a hydraulic jack to said 
equipment. Against this plate a second plate (18) is coupled 

which is provided with two parallel, horizontal and 
elongated curved slots (16,17) cooperating with four fixed 

pins (12-15), three of them being placed at the apices of a 
horizontal base triangle, the fourth being located in 

the middle of the horizontal base of said triangle. The 
slots extend them as anti-clockwise curved slots (20,21), the 

upper one directed downward, the lower one directed 
upward and having radius equal to the distance of said 

fourth pin respectively from the apex pin and from the 
base pin. A further anti-clockwise curved slot (22) is 

provided directed downward which starts from the lower 
slot at a distance from its end equal to the double of 

the distance fourth pin - base pin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an economical and 
efficient system that, by allowing a smooth, simple and 
fast shift into a vertical position, driven by the 
towing mean, of a cumbersome industrial or agricultural 
equipment, it makes possible the road transportation of 
said equipment. It is well known that some industrial, mainly 
agricultural, equipment such as harrows, tedders, 
sowing machines, cutters, pathway makers, fertiliser 
distributors a.s.o. shows an overall width that very 
much exceeds 2.50 meters, maximum value permissible for 
the road circulation. Therefore there is a problem for its road 
transportation, which is more and more important with 
the coming into force of the new road traffic 
regulations. The above problem is currently solved by disconnecting 
the equipment from the towing mean, connecting said 
towing mean with a special trailer suitable to carry 
the equipment, placed on it with its higher dimension 
parallel to the movement direction. It is ready apparent the uneasiness of such solution, 
which, apart from requiring a considerable waste of 
time for the operations of the equipment disconnecting, 
rising and positioning on the trailer as well as the 
reverse operations, once the operating zone is reached, 
requires also the availability of a cumbersome and 
expensive special trailer. It is a object of the present invention to avoid the 
above-mentioned drawbacks and to provide an efficient 
system allowing to reduce the size of the equipment to 
the permissible proportions, without disconnecting it 
from the towing mean. The above object is substantially reached by rotating 
the equipment through 90 degrees around a fixed pin, 
coupled with the towing mean, up to a complete vertical  
 
position thereof, after having rised and sideway moved 
it, to make possible such rotation without any ground 
interference. More particularly, the above rotation is mechanically 
obtained by means of three pins placed on a first fixed 
plate, coupled with the towing mean, and located 
substantially at the apices of a triangle having an 
horizontal base, and by means of a fourth pin placed in 
the middle of the horizontal base of the above 
triangle. The above fixed pins cooperate with two parallel and 
horizontal elongated slots provided on a second plate 
coupled with the equipment and placed against the first 
plate. The above two slots subsequently extend to two anti-clockwise 
curved slots, the upper one directed 
downward, the lower one directed upward, said curved 
slots
