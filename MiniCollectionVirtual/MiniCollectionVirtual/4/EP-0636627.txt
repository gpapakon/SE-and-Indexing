<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel cephem compounds whose 
substituent group at the 3-position is a pyridiniopropenyl group 
having a substituent group and to antimicrobial agents having 
anti-MRSA activity which contain at least one of these compounds 
as an active ingredient. In this connection, MRSA means 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or a multipledrug 
resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While various antibiotics have been used widely for the 
treatment of diseases, there have come out some pathogenic 
bacteria resistant to these antibiotics, such bacteria being 
called drug resistant bacteria or multipledrug resistant 
bacteria. Among these multipledrug resistant bacteria, MRSA is much 
feared as a possible cause of intractable infection or hospital 
infection. Several anti-MRSA antibacterial agents have been 
developed, but request is still strong for the development of 
more effective novel anti-MRSA antibacterial agents.  Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention 
desirably provide an antibacterial agent, especially one which 
is effective against MRSA. The present invention thus provides novel antibacterial 
agents and novel cephem compounds usable as an active principle 
of such antibacterial agents. In an aspect of the present invention there are provided 
some novel cephem compounds. In another aspect of the present 
invention, there are provided some novel antibacterial agents 
containing, as an active ingredient, at least one of such cephem 
compounds. Embodiments of the invention are described below by way 
of example only and by reference to the accompanying drawings 
of which: Fig. 1 shows the reaction steps in Examples 1 and 2. Fig. 2 shows the reaction steps in Examples 3 to 6. The present invention relates to novel cephem compounds 
and antimicrobial agents, especially antibacterial agents 
effective on MRSA, which contain at least one of the novel 
cephem compounds as an active ingredient.  The present invention will be described in greater detail, 
as follows. A first aspect of the present invention relates to a cephem 
compound represented by the following general formula (I) and a 
physiologically acceptable salt thereof. 
In the above formula, R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or a 
protective group of the amino group; R² represents a hydrogen 
atom, a protective group of the hydroxyimino group or an alkyl 
group; R³ represents an acetyl group, an amino group which may 
have appropriate substituent groups, a carbamoyl group which may 
have appropriate substituent
</DESCRIPTION>
