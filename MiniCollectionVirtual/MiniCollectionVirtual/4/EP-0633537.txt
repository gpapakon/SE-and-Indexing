<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for searching a compressed 
document while a plurality of character strings stored in the 

compressed document are stored in a compressed code. A query 
request is received, the query request is converted into the 

compressed code, and the converted query request is compared 
with the compressed codes stored in the compressed document. 

The initiator of the query request is then informed about the 
results of the comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a computer
method and system for searching data in a computer.The electronic collection and storage of
information presents problems in many environments. For
example, when data is downloaded from an information
service to a remote computer, vast amounts of data are
transferred in a short interval. The remote computer
typically stores this data in a computer memory for later
processing. To reduce the amount of data transferred by
the information service, the amount of data stored by the
remote computer, and the time required for transmission of
the data, the information service typically compresses the
data before transmitting the data to the remote computer.Compression methods generally fall into two
categories: fixed length compression methods and variable
length compression methods. Fixed length compression
methods represent each symbol by the same number of bits.
For example, the LZ 78 type of Ziv-Lempel coding is a
fixed length compression method. Variable length
compression methods represent each symbol by a varying
number of bits. Variable length compression methods
typically assign shorter codes to more frequently used
symbols. For example, the well-known Morse code is a
variable length compression method.Existing systems convert the compressed code
representing the data back into its uncompressed form and
then process the uncompressed data if it is desired to
search through the data. Searching through uncompressed data is known from
"The Art of Computer Programming - Volume 3/Sorting and Searching"
by Donald E.Knuth (ISBN 0-201-03803-X). This requires a time consuming
decompression step. It would be desirable to have a search method
which allows for the more efficient searching of data that
has been compressed.The present invention provides a method and
system for searching a compressed document as defined in claims 1 and 2.Figure 1 is a block diagram of a system
embodying the present invention for searching for
character strings in a compressed document while the
character strings are stored in a compressed code. Figure 2 is a block diagram of a sample
document.Figure 3 is a block diagram of the uncompressed
codes of the sample document.Figure 4 is a block diagram of a query request
displayed on a display device for the system of Figure 1.Figure 5 is a block diagram of the character
string parsed from the query request. Figure 6 is a block diagram of a variable
length compressed code for the system of Figure 1.Figure 7A is a block diagram of a dictionary

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for searching a compressed document comprised of a
plurality of variable length compressed codes which represent

an uncompressed document, each variable length compressed code
having a length indicator which indicates the length of the

variable length compressed code, the apparatus comprising:

means for receiving a query request in an uncompressed code;
means for converting the query request from the uncompressed
code into a converted query request of one of the plurality of

variable length compressed codes;
means for determining the length of the converted query
request;
means for comparing the converted query request with the
variable length compressed codes of the compressed document, to

determine if variable length compressed codes of the compressed
document match the converted query request, wherein the

converted query request is only compared with those variable
length compressed codes whose length is equal to the length of

the converted query request, and 
means for responding to the determination that there is a match
between the variable length compressed codes of the document

and the converted query request.
