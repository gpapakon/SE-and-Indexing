<ABSTRACT>
In a transfer unit (4) of a non-contact roller transfer 
method, both ends of a transfer roller shaft (9) are 

supported independently of each other so as to be movable 
upward and downward, and an upward pushing force is provided 

thereto. A gap maintaing roller (10) provided in the 
vicinity of each end portion of the transfer roller shaft is 

always in contact with the surface of a photoreceptor drum 
(1) so that the gap between the surface of the photoreceptor 

drum and the transfer roller (8) is maintained uniform and 
fixed. Further, both ends of a pre-transfer guide (11) for 

guiding the sheet to the photoreceptor drum are supported in 
a manner such that the movement of each end accords with the 

movement of the end portion of the transfer roller, so that 
the distance between the photoreceptor drum and the pre-transfer 

guide is maintained uniform and fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus
such as an electrophotographic copying machine, a laser printer
and a facsimile apparatus, and more particularly, to an improvement
of a transfer unit employing a roller transfer method for
transferring a toner image formed on the surface of a photoreceptor
drum onto a sheet of paper.In a transfer unit of a roller transfer method which is
widely used in an image forming apparatus such as a copying
machine, a conductive transfer roller is rotatively in contact
with the surface of a photoreceptor drum carrying a toner image
on its surface and rotating in one direction, so that a copy
sheet is pressed against the toner on the drum surface. Then,
a voltage reverse to that of the toner is applied to the
transfer roller to transfer the toner image formed on the drum
surface onto the sheet.In a conventional transfer unit employing the roller
transfer method, however, since the transfer roller is directly
in contact with the drum surface when no sheet is present
therebetween, residual toner on the drum surface adheres to the
periphery of the transfer roller. Therefore, in the conventional
transfer unit, a means is required for cleaning the transfer
roller. Further, when the peripheral surface of the transfer
roller is not in contact with the drum surface at a uniform and 
appropriate pressure, there is a non-uniformity in the image
transferred to the sheet.To solve such problems, a non-contact roller transfer
method as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 has been developed. In the
transfer unit shown in these figures, a gap maintaining roller
33 having a diameter greater than that of a transfer roller 31
is attached to each end of a roller shaft 32 to which the
transfer roller 31 is attached, and the peripheral surface of
the gap maintaining roller 33 is in contact with the surface of
a photoreceptor drum 34 so that a predetermined gap C is left
between the peripheral surface of the transfer roller 31 and the
drum surface.With this arrangement, since the transfer roller 31 faces
the drum 34 without being in contact therewith, the residual
toner does not adhere to the peripheral surface of the transfer
roller 31 and no cleaning means is necessary. Further, since
the gap C between the drum surface and the peripheral surface of
the transfer roller 31 is always maintained uniform by the gap
maintaining roller 33, the generation of the image non-uniformity
is restrained.The arrangement of the transfer unit will be described in
detail. Each of the front and rear ends of

<CLAIMS>
A transfer unit for transferring an image formed on a
surface of a photoreceptor drum (1) arranged horizontally

to a sheet conveyed to the photoreceptor drum,
comprising


a transfer roller (8) arranged below and in parallel
to the photoreceptor drum and pushed upward with an

elastic force,
gap maintaining members (10) attached to both ends of
the transfer roller for maintaining a gap of a uniform

width between the transfer roller and the photoreceptor
drum against the elastic force by abutting

the photoreceptor drum, and
a pre-transfer guide (11) arranged in a vicinity of
an upstream side of the transfer roller so as to be

parallel to the photoreceptor drum at a predetermined
height relative to the photoreceptor drum for guiding

the sheet to the surface of the photoreceptor drum,
characterized by
a first roller supporting member (13) which supports
a first end of the transfer roller and pushes the

first end upward with an elastic force,
