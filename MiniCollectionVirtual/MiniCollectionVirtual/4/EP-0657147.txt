graft 20 at a predetermined location across an 

abdominal aortic aneurysm. The assembly includes a 
resilient self-expanding anchor 30 that is secured 

to the graft. The anchor is characterized as being 

at least as long as the graft, and further as being 
adapted to be removed or repositioned at any time 

prior to complete deployment in the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to devices and means for placing
and securing a vascular graft in a predetermined location
in a patient's vascular system. One such device is
disclosed in EP-A-472731.It has been long accepted practice to treat a variety of
vascular disorders in a surgical procedure that involves
placement of a vascular graft in a patient's vascular
system. The construction and characteristic of the graft
typically will be adapted to optimize its use in the specific
surgical environment and condition to be treated and,
accordingly, a number of different types of grafts are
available. Among the most common types of vascular grafts
are those formed from a woven or knitted tubular fabric as
well as non-fabric tubes such as expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene. Such grafts typically are placed in
a patient's vascular system in a highly invasive surgical
procedure. In general, the complexity of the surgical
procedure required to place the graft will depend on many
factors, including the location and surgical accessibility of
the portion of the patient's vasculature where the graft is
to be placed.Not all vascular conditions in which it would be
desirable to place a graft can be so treated. Among the
particularly troublesome medical conditions in which it is
desirable to place a graft is that of an abdominal aortic 
aneurysm, in which a portion of the patient's aorta, the
major artery carrying blood from the heart, has developed a
weakened wall such that the weakened portion will tend to
expand under the influence of the patient's blood pressure.
An aortic aneurysm presents a life threatening risk that the
aneurysm may burst causing massive internal bleeding.
Treatment of the condition typically has involved deeply
invasive abdominal surgery in which the patient's abdominal
cavity is opened to reach and expose the aortic aneurysm.
While maintaining the patient on an independent life support
system, the region of the aneurysm is incised lengthwise to
enable insertion of the graft into the aorta to span the
weakened region and define a structurally tubular flow path
between the remaining healthy portions of the aorta. The
graft so positioned then is sutured in place. The graft thus
serves as a reinforcing liner for the weakened portion of the
aorta. Such surgical procedures have been characterized by a
relatively high mortality and morbidity rate. Typically,
patients suffering from the condition are elderly and are
less able to survive the rigors of major abdominal surgery.
Additionally, there is a substantial

A repair assembly (10) for placement in a blood vessel and which can be removed
from the blood vessel, and which comprises


a tubular graft (20) having a proximal end, a distal end, and an axial length;
and
an anchor (30) co-axial with the graft and having a proximal end (33), a
distal end (35) and an axial length at least equal to that of the graft, wherein the

proximal end and the distal end of the anchor are resiliently expandable and
connected to each other by a plurality of longitudinal segments (34') arranged

around the axis of the anchor, the arrangement being such that:

(i) the segments extending between the proximal and distal ends of the
anchor transmit a radial compression force from one end of the anchor to the other,
(ii) compression of the graft radially in the middle of the length of the
assembly is resisted by the anchor, although less strongly than at the axial ends of

the assembly; and
(iii) at least one of the proximal (33) or distal (35) ends of the anchor is
radially resiliently compressible within its own length from a first relatively larger

diameter disposition to a low profile relatively smaller diameter disposition and
extends beyond its respective end of the graft, said at least one end defining a

connector (37) for direct connection to a delivery device (85) upon resilient
compression to said low profile disposition.
A repair assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the at least one end is formed
from a continuous loop of wire, which defines the connector, said connector taking

the form of a plurality of distal bends (36D) in the wire arranged at spaced
locations around the circumference of the loop.
A repair assembly as in claim 1 or 2 wherein the anchor is secured to the interior of
the graft.
A repair assembly as in claim 1 or 2 wherein the anchor is secured to the exterior of
the graft. 
A repair assembly as in claim 1 or 2 wherein a first portion of the anchor is secured

to the interior of the graft and a second portion of the anchor is secured to the
exterior of the graft.
A repair assembly as in any one of the preceding claims wherein the anchor is
constructed to have a resilient expansion force along its entire length.
A repair assembly as in any one of the preceding claims wherein the anchor is
formed from wire, in which substantially straight portions (34) are interspersed

with bends (36).
A repair assembly as in claim 7 including welds (46, 38) between abutting bends in
the proximal and distal ends of the anchor.
A repair assembly as in claim 7 or 8 wherein the resilient expansion force is greater
in both the proximal and distal ends of the anchor than in the middle of the anchor.
A repair assembly as in any one of the preceding claims, wherein at least one of the self-expanding
segments comprises a single continuous segment of wire having a series of bends

(37).
A repair assembly as in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the anchor
comprises a single continuous segment of wire having a plurality of bends (36) at

each end of the anchor, each bend being joined to two longitudinal wire segments,
wherein each longitudinal wire segment is joined to an adjacent longitudinal wire

segment.
A repair assembly as in claim 11 wherein each longitudinal segment is joined (46,
48) to two adjacent longitudinal wire segments.
A repair assembly as in claim 11 or 12 wherein the adjacent longitudinal wire
segments are joined at a point. 
An abdominal aortic repair assembly comprising:

a cylindrical graft (20) that is adapted to be positioned within a blood vessel,
the graft having a proximal end, a distal end, and an axial length; and
a self-expanding anchor (30) secured to the graft, the anchor adapted to
inhibit migration of the graft once it is properly positioned at a desired location in a

blood vessel,

wherein the anchor has a proximal end (33), a distal end (35) and an axial
length at least equal to that of the graft,

wherein the proximal end and the distal end of the anchor are resiliently

(34); arranged around the axis of the anchor,

wherein each resiliently expandable end is formed from a zigzag wire hoop;

and

wherein at least one of the proximal (33) or distal (35) ends of the anchor is radially

disposition to a low profile relatively smaller diameter disposition and extends beyond
its respective end of the graft, said at least one end defining a connector (37) for

direct connection to a delivery device (85) upon resilient compression to said low
profile disposition.
A repair assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding claims and including a
device for positioning the assembly as an implant within a blood vessel, which

device comprises:

(a) a tubular sheath (60) for maintaining the implant in a radially
compressed configuration, the sheath having a proximal end and a distal end and

being open at its distal end and axially moveable relative to the implant,

spokes adapted to engage a proximal portion of the implant.
A repair assembly as in claim 17 wherein the spokes are adapted to engage the implant until
the implant is fully released from the sheath.
