<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for detecting a magnetic field has 
been described incorporating a material (82) which switches from an 

antiferromagnetic order to a ferromagnetic order upon the 
application of a magnetic field and wherein the material is 

FeRh, FeRu, FePd or MnPt, a heating (89,92) 
element for controlling 

the temperature of the material and a current source (78) for 
sensing the change of resistance of the material to determine 

when the material is ferromagnetically ordered. The invention 
overcomes the problem of small changes in resistance of 

magnetoresistive sensors operating in only the ferromagnetic 
order.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sensors for detecting magnetic 
fields, and more particularly, to a magnetoresistive sensor 
utilizing a metallic compound which undergoes a electronic 
phase transition in a magnetic field from an antiferromagnetic 
state to a ferromagnetic state and vice versa when the 
magnetic field is removed and has a corresponding "giant 
magnetoresistive effect". Magnetoresistive devices exhibit a change of resistance to 
current passing therethrough when the magnetic field is 
changed. Typically, two layers of ferromagnetic material are 
used to form a magnetoresistive device and wherein the field 
intercepted by the magnetoresistive device exceeds the 
coercivity of one of the layers in order to provide a change 
in direction of the magnetization in one of the layers. 
Magnetoresistive devices have been used for detecting magnetic 
fields from magnetic tape and direct access storage devices 
(DASD). For example, a magnetoresistive device is positioned 
in a head attached to a slider in a DASD. The head is 
positioned over a magnetic layer on a rotating disk and 
detects magnetic fields emanating from the magnetic layer 
indicative of data stored therein. Examples of 
magnetoresistive devices are described in U.S. Patent 
4,476,454 which issued on October 9, 1984 to J.A. Aboaf et al. 
which describes devices and circuits employing 
magnetoresistive materials exhibiting a negative (Δp) change 
in resistivity effect. A more recent magnetoresistive device 
showing a 
Δp = 9  
 with a magnetic field is in the range from 
20 to 120 Oe is described in U.S. Patent 5,159,513 which 
issued on October 27, 1992 to B. Dieny et al. entitled, 
"Magnetoresistive Sensor Based on the Spin Valve Effect".  While a change of 9% resistivity may seem large, there is a 
need in the industry to have magnetoresistive devices which 
exhibit changes in resistivity greater than 9% at a lower 
magnetic field. Some magnetoresistive sensors have utilized an 
antiferromagnetic layer to provide a longitudinal exchange 
bias in a ferromagnetic layer. The exchange bias merely fixes 
the direction of magnetization in the ferromagnetic layer. 
One such device, is described in U.S. Patent 5,014,147 which 
issued on May 7, 1991 to S.P. Parkin et al. which uses an 
alloy of Fe(1-x)Mnx where x is within the range of 0.3 to 0.4, 
as an antiferromagnetic layer. Certain metallic compounds have been known to undergo a 
magnetic phase transition from antiferromagnetic (AF) to 
ferromagnetic (FM) that are found in nature as well as
