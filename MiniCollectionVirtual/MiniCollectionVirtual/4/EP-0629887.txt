<ABSTRACT>
A right angle strain relief system (10) is 
provided for an optical fiber cable (12). A fiber optic 

connector (14) terminates a fiber (16) of the cable on a 
longitudinal connector axis (18). A right angle strain 

relief boot (20) extends from a rear (22) of the connector 
and has a cable-receiving passage (36) therethrough. The 

boot has a first leg portion (38) and a second leg portion 
(40) joined by a bend (42). The first leg portion is on 

the longitudinal connector axis and defines a proximal end 
(44) of the boot coupled to the rear of the connector. 

The second leg portion (40) extends transversely of the 
longitudinal connector axis and defines an open distal end 

(46) of the boot from which the optical fiber cable 
extends. The boot is rotatable relative to the connector 

about the longitudinal connector axis. A slot (52) is 
provided in the boot extending from the open distal end 

thereof generally to at least the bend in the boot. The 

slot is of a width to allow the optical fiber cable to be 
moved outwardly of the second leg portion (40) to a 

position projecting from the first leg portion (38) 
generally on the longitudinal connector axis (18). The 

boot can be rotated to various angular orientations 
relative to the connector, while the cable is in the axial 

position, without twisting the cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
cable connectors and, particularly, to a right angle cable 
strain relief for connectors such as optical fiber 
connectors. Connectors are used for joining light-transmitting 
optical fiber cables to transmitter devices, 
receiver devices or to other cables. Optical fiber cables 
are somewhat delicate in that they can be bent or kinked 
and damage or destroy the interior buffered fiber of the 
cable. Therefore, as an optical fiber cable projects away 
from a connection, it is important that the fiber project 
in a manner that will not overstress or kink the fiber. 
Overstressing or kinking can interfere with the signal 
transmitting capabilities of the fiber. Of course, the best condition for an optical 
fiber cable is to project straight away from its 
connection. However, it is not always possible to extend 
the cable in a straight line, particularly when the cable 
is used in compact environments. For example, connections 
are made to transceiver devices located at the rear of a 
computer and toward a rear wall. This requires routing or 
dressing the cable at an angle away from its connection, 
sometimes a severe angle to the plane of the connection. In view of the problems identified above and to 
satisfy various packaging requirements, fiber optic 
connectors often are provided with right angle boots projecting 
from the rear of the connectors to maintain the  
 
terminated optical fiber cables in smooth angles projecting 
from the connectors. The boots prevent overstressing or 
kinking of the buffered fiber and provide an improved 
strain relief for the cables as the cables are maintained 
in minimum bend radius parameters. However, one of the problems with right-angled, 
booted connectors is that a boot often projects from a 
connector at a given or f ixed angle, whereas it may be 
necessary to dress the cable away from the connector at a 
different angle. Providing an inventory of connectors with 
boots at various different angles could be an unduly 
expensive expedient. Consequently, connectors have been 
provided with right angle boots which rotate about the 
longitudinal connector axes to different angles and thereby 
accommodate different packaging/dressing requirements. A 
problem with such rotatable boots is that, if a cable is 
terminated to the connector and extends through the boot, 
rotation of the boot can twist the cable and damage the 
bufered fiber therewithin. The US-A-5 037 175 dicloses an optical fiber 
connector comprising a
