<ABSTRACT>
A solid step process for converting a polycrystalline 
body to a single crystal body includes the steps of forming a selected 

surface topography on the body and then heating the body at a 
temperature below its melting temperature for a time sufficient to 

substantially convert the polycrystalline material to single crystal 
material. The surface topography includes depressions or 

protrusions from the body having sidewalls of the polycrystalline 
material that are disposed to intersect one another at junctions 

forming relatively sharp comers, and the dimensions of the sidewalls 
are greater than the average grain size of the polycrystalline material. 

Typically alumina is the polycrystalline material and surface features 
include grooves or the like. The patterned alumina body with the 

selected surface topography is heated to a temperature between 
1800° and 2000° C in one or more cycles to convert the 

polycrystalline alumina to sapphire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The manufacture of polycrystalline alumina (PCA), and
its use for high pressure sodium arc discharge lamps (hereinafter
"HPS lamps") is known in the art. U.S. Patents 3,026,210; 4,150,317
and 4,285,732 to Coble, Laska et al and Charles et al, disclose the
production of a high density PCA body having improved visible light
transmission using relatively pure alumina powder and small
amounts of magnesia. U.S. Patent 4,285,732 further teaches adding
zirconia and hafnia to the magnesia-doped alumina to reduce the
chances of precipitating a spinel phase and exaggerated or run away
grain growth during sintering. PCA bodies useful as arc tubes for
HPS lamps have been made according to the processes in these
patents having an average grain size ranging from between 15
microns to 100 microns.Two major drawbacks associated with the use of PCA
arc tubes for HPS lamps are that they are light translucent as
opposed to light transparent and the sodium in the arc reacts with the
alumina at the grain boundaries to form sodium aluminate, which
adversely affects the structural integrity of the tube and shortens lamp
life. HPS lamps are being designed for ever increasing internal
sodium partial pressure within the PCA arc tube to improve the color
rendition and provide a whiter emitted light. However, higher internal
sodium pressure further shortens lamp life due to increased rate of
sodium loss from the arc chamber. Progressive sodium loss results in
a corresponding continual rise in the lamp operating voltage, a
decrease of both correlated color temperature and color rendering
index, and a color shift from white to pink Also, the sodium which
migrates through the arc chamber wall deposits on the inside wall of
the evacuated outer lamp envelope causing a brownish stain on the
envelope which, in turn, further reduces the light output of the lamp.
These problems are substantially reduced with sapphire (i.e., single
crystal alumina) arc tubes.Sapphire arc tubes useful as the arc chamber for HPS
lamps have been made by a number of processes, including a 
modified Czochralski process known as the edge-defined, film-fed
growth (EFG) process developed by Tyco Laboratories, Inc. This
process uses a seed crystal and a die on the surface of molten
alumina in which a hollow tube is continuously pulled out of the melt
through the die. This process is expensive and slow. Another
process used to produce single crystal alumina (sapphire) is called
the floating zone process in which a PCA feed rod is introduced at a
predetermined
