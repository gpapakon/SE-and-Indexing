<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composition comprising 
among others a fibrinopeptide A releasing compound. The invention also relates to the use of the 
composition as calibrator in plasma containing 
fibrinogen. A test kit comprising the said composition and a 
method to determine soluble fibrin in plasma also 
belong to the invention. Thrombosis is a serious and often fatal disease 
in which blood clots (thrombi) interfere with the 
normal flow of blood in blood vessels or the heart. 
Fibrin is a protein generated by the action of the 
blood coagulation protein thrombin on fibrinogen. A 
thrombus is a deposit of blood components, such as 
fibrin with red blood cells and/or aggregated 
platelets in a blood vessel or cavity of the heart. A 
thrombus includes insoluble fibrin polymers that are 
later decomposed through fibrinolysis. Thrombi can 
obstruct normal blood flow, leading to serious and 
often fatal consequences. Other disorders also exhibit an increased 
tendency to thrombosis. These include, but are not 
limited to cancer, pregnancy, aging, trauma, oral 
contraceptive use, diabetes mellitus, liver and kidney 
disease, obesity, and major surgical interventions 
such as elective hip replacement in elderly people.  
 Minimizing the risk of thrombosis to patients by 
anticoagulant therapy is a frequently applied 
treatment in the field. When an anticoagulant is 
administered, it is necessary to determine the desired 
levels of the drug to maintain effective therapy. 
Currently the appropriate dosage for oral anticoagulant 
therapy is established by monitoring the 
patient's prothrombin time ("PT"), which is maintained 
at approximately one and one-half to two and one-half 
times that obtained with normal plasma. The 
approximate dosage for heparin therapy is often 
established by monitoring the patient's activated 
partial thromboplastin time ("APTT"), which is 
maintained higher than 1.5 times the control. Blood coagulation is a highly complex process, 
not totally understood even today. The final stage of 
the coagulation pathway results in the formation of 
fibrin, a component required for thrombus formation. 
Prothrombin activation and the associated generation 
of thrombin are required for fibrin formation. Fibrin formation is a multistep process, which is 
initiated by thrombin. Firstly thrombin, the product of 
an activated coagulation system, will release fibrinopeptides 
A from the amino-terminal ends of the two 
fibrinogen AÎ±-chains. Simultaneously, but more slowly, fibrinopeptides 
B are
