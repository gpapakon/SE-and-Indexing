<ABSTRACT>
In a terminal adapter which is located between a 
data terminal equipment unit (11) and a data 

communication network (12) and which includes a buffer 
memory (22, 27) for memorizing an original data signal 

sequence sent from each of the data terminal equipment 
unit and the data communication network, the original 

data signal sequence is subjected to data compression by 
a data compression circuit to be thereafter memorized 

into the buffer memory and to be read out of the buffer 
memory as a readout data signal sequence. The readout 

data signal sequence is expanded by a data expansion 
circuit (32, 35) to be sent to the data terminal 

equipment unit or the data communication network at a 
transmission rate matched therewith. The data 

compression may be executed by the use of an LZ method, a 
modified LZ method, such as LZW, LZSS, or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a terminal adapter
between a data terminal equipment (DTE) unit and a data
communication network, such as a integrated services
digital network (ISDN). It is to be noted that the
terminal adapter is usually used to match transmission
rates between the data communication network and the data
terminal equipment unit with each other.According to the definition (I.112) of CCITT
recommendations, ISDN is defined as a network which
establishes digital connections between users and network
interfaces and which can execute integrated services.
This means that a wide variety of communication or
information processing services can be provided by the
use of a single digital network. Herein, such
communication services may be telephone, data, and
facsimile communication services while information
processing services may be for processing various kinds
of information. As known in the art, packet
communication is usually executed in the ISDN.In addition, a specification is defined in the
CCITT recommendation I.430 as regards a first layer 
between basic users and network interfaces.
Specifically, the specification prescribes electric and
physical conditions between users and the network
interfaces. In other words, the recommendation is
directed to a basic interface basically used in the ISDN
and a first-order group interface which is for carrying
out a multiplex access and a high speed access and which
is considered to be used in companies or the like.Herein, a summary will be described hereinunder
only about the specification of the basic interface
related to the instant invention. Namely, the
specification prescribes an interface rate of 192 Kbit/s
(namely, Kbps), two B channels (64 Kbps) for transmission
of user information, and a single D channel (16 Kbps) for
controlling a network. This shows that signalling
information is transmitted through the D channel.In the meanwhile, it is to be noted that
transmission rates between the network and the data
terminal equipment (DTE) unit should be matched with each
other so as to carry out communication therebetween by
the use of the packet communication executed in the ISDN
or the like.For example, the transmission rate on the network
side of the ISDN is equal to 64 Kbps in the B channel and
16 Kbps in the D channel, as mentioned above, while the
transmission rate on the data terminal equipment unit
side is equal to 9.6 Kbps and is slower than that on the
network side. Taking this into account, a terminal 
adapter is located between the network
