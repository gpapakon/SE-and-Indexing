<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver arrangement utilising direct conversion or conversion to a low 
IF frequency, in which the local oscillator signal is frequency modulated to avoid the 

possibility of the local oscillator frequency drifting into a zero beat frequency region 
where only a d.c. voltage will be obtained from the mixer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to direct conversion or homodyne radio receivers. 
Such receivers have a number of advantages over conventional heterodyne receivers, 
among which are that expensive image signal filtering is not required, selectivity filters 
are at low frequency, so that op-amp filters or gyrator filters may be used and, since 
image frequency signals are not filtered out, a sensitivity improvement of 3dB over 
conventional heterodyne receivers can be obtained. However, a major concern in direct conversion receivers is the possibility of the 
local oscillator drifting in frequency into the zero frequency beat region, where only a 
d.c. voltage will he obtained from the mixer. According to one aspect of the present invention in a direct conversion radio 
receiver or a low IF radio receiver the local oscillator is arranged to be frequency 
modulated. According to another aspect of the present invention in a radio receiver for 
receiving carrier frequency signals which are amplitude modulated with audio frequency 
or low frequency signals, and in which a local oscillator is arranged to provide signals 
of a frequency substantially at or close to said carrier frequency to enable direct 
conversion of received signals or conversion to a low IF, the local oscillator is arranged 
to be frequency modulated. Preferably the modulation frequency and the frequency deviation of the local 
oscillator signals are above the maximum expected data rate or audio frequency at the 
output of the mixer of the receiver. A radio receiver in accordance with the present invention will now be described 
with reference to the accompanying drawing, of which:- 
Figure 1 shows the receiver schematically, and Figure 2 illustrates the frequency range of signals occurring in the receiver of 
Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, as in a conventional receiver an amplitude modulated 
carrier signal at a nominal frequency of, say 433 MHz is received at antenna 1, amplified  
 
by an RF amplifier 2 and applied to a mixer 3. The output signals from the mixer 3 may 
be low-pass filtered by filter 4, amplified by amplifier 5, rectified by detector 6 and 
applied either to a data slicer or to an audio amplifier 7. In the present arrangement a local oscillator 8, which provides signals to the 
mixer 3 at the same nominal frequency as the received signals, is frequency modulated 
by signals from a low frequency oscillator 9, which a frequency deviation of, say, 
80kHz. The signals from the oscillator 9 may be square wave signals at a
