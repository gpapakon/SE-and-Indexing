<ABSTRACT>
In order to enable simple weaving of a three-dimensional textile 
in the form of braid having a large orientation angle, a device for 

applying tension to a length of thread is provided which applies a great 
tension to a length of thread when the same is drawn out, and a small 

tension to a length of thread when the same is pulled back while an 
amount of thread pulled back is great. The device is used in textile 

machinery, in which a carrier (20) for a length of thread (24) disposed 
in a plane of movement of the carrier is caused by a drive mechanism 

to run along a predetermined path in the plane of movement so that 
threads (24) carried by the carriers (20) are textured with one another for 

weaving of a three-dimensional texture. Provided on the carrier (20) is 
a high tension mechanism (21) which provides a small amount of thread 

pulled back and a great drawing-out tension for a thread (24) which is 
drawn out from a bobbin (23), and provided between the carrier (20) 

and the bobbin (23) is a low tension mechanism (22) which provides 
a great amount of thread pulled back and a small drawing-out tension. 

With this arrangement, a great thread tension is applied to a thread by 
the high tension mechanism (21) when the thread (24) is to be drawn 

out, and a small thread tension is applied to the thread by the small 
tension mechanism (22) after a pulling-back limit given by the high 

tension mechanism (21) is exceeded in pulling back the thread.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to yarn tensioning method and
device suitable for use on textile weaving machines, and more
particularly to yarn tensioning method and device which can be
effectively used especially on textile weaving machines for
fabrication of three-dimensional braids such as square
braider, magnaweave, three-dimensional braider and the like.In case of a weaving machine which is directed to the
fabrication of braid type three-dimensional fabrics as
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H4-41756,
namely, in case of a weaving machine which is arranged to
produce three-dimensional fabrics by interweaving yarns fed
from a number of yarn carriers, which are driven from a
carrier drive mechanism to shift the respective positions
along predetermined loci of movements in a common carrier
moving plane, it is necessary to provide a yarn orientation
angle setting means in order to make the orientation angles of 
the respective yarns substantially uniform by beating actions
in a stabilized manner or in order to control the yarn
orientation angles arbitrarily.The inventor of the present invention proposed an
effective means for setting such orientation angles in a prior
Japanese Patent Application H4-180408. In a weaving process
by a braid type three-dimensional textile weaving machine
without an orientation angle setting means of this sort, the
greater the yarn draw-out rate in each weaving cycle of the
textile to be fabricated, the smaller becomes the orientation
angle of the textile. If the orientation angle becomes too
small, the resulting fabric cannot be regarded as
substantially three-dimensional fabric any longer.On the other hand, in case of the above-mentioned
braid type three-dimensional textile weaving machine, the yarn
orientation angle in three-dimensional fabric can be increased
by the use of a yarn tensioning device as disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H2-178176 or by the use
of a yarn tensioning device as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication H4-47054. However, a greater orientation angle is
reflected by a greater yarn draw-out angle from the yarn
tensioning device, so that, when a bobbin is moving away from
the center of the fabric being woven, it becomes necessary to
draw out the yarn by more than an amount to be consumed by the
weaving operation. It follows that, when the bobbin is 
approaching the center of the fabric, this time there arises a
necessity for drawing back the yarn toward the bobbin to take
up an excess amount of yarn which would remain
