<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vacuum kneading and extruding method and
apparatus. More particularly, the invention relates to an improvement in a
vacuum kneading and extruding method for kneading, decompressing and
extruding in a predetermined shape, chemical materials such as soap basis
or various oils and fats, and to an apparatus for use in executing this
method.In a conventional vacuum kneading and extruding method and apparatus,
as shown in Fig. 6, plural types of material to be treated are measured
separately and intermittently by means of batch type measuring devices 1.
The measured materials are suitably mixed in a mixing device 31. The
mixture is then supplied in atmospheric condition to a kneading device 32
consisting of a two-stage pelletizer used exclusively to knead the mixture.
The kneaded mixture is transported by a conveyor device 33 to a vacuum
kneading and extruding device 34 consisting of a two-stage vacuum extruder.
Then, the mixture is kneaded again, and extruded in a predetermined shape
through a forming mechanism 4. The extruded product is cut by an
automatic cutter 5, and stamped by an automatic stamping machine 6.The conventional vacuum kneading and extruding apparatus noted
above uses numerous devices and machines up to the extruding stage.
These include the measuring devices for measuring plural types of material, 
the mixing device for mixing the materials, the kneading device, conveyor
device and vacuum extruder. Consequently, the apparatus as a whole
requires a very large installation space. This apparatus has a further
disadvantage of requiring extensive auxiliary equipment such as electric
wiring and air and water piping.In addition, since the various devices are installed independent of one
another, part of the material under treatment could scatter in large quantities
or foreign matters and large quantities of air could mix into the material
during transfer from one device to a next device.The preambles of claims 1 and 4 are based on US-A-4738609.The object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum kneading
and extruding method, and a vacuum kneading and extruding apparatus
having a compact overall construction for use in executing this method,
which prevent foreign matters and large quantities of air from mixing into
material under treatment, thereby to obtain moldings of uniform quality
through an operation in a vacuum.The above object is fulfilled, according to the present invention, by a
vacuum kneading and extruding method as defined in claim 1 In a further
