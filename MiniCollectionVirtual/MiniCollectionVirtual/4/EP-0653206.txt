<ABSTRACT>
An anti-HIV agent, for preventing and treating AIDS, containing as the active ingredient a disulfide represented by the 

general formula (I): R¹-S-S-R² (wherein R¹ represents C₂-C₂₀ alkenyl, and R² represents C₂-C₂₀ alkenyl or C₁-C₂₀ alkyl), or 
an unsaturated alcohol or its ester represented by the general formula (II): R¹-O-R³ (wherein R¹ represents C₂-C₂₀ alkenyl, 

and R³ represents hydrogen, C₂-C₂₀ acyl, phosphoryl or a phospholipid group). This agent has a potent growth inhibitor effect 
against persistently HIV-infected cells, against which the conventional anti-HIV agents have been inefficacious, thus 

being useful for treating AIDS.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-HIV (Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus) agent useful for prophylaxis of and 
treatment for AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). AIDS is a disease caused by HIV infection, and the 
number of patients thereof is rapidly increasing since this 
disease was discovered in the United States of America in 
1983. It has been known to use azidothymidine (AZT), 
didanosine (DDI) or the like, which is an anti-HIV agent, in 
treatment for such AIDS. However, AZT is recognized to have a life-prolonging 
effect to a significant extent, but involves a problem that 
it has side effects such as headache, gastrointestinal 
disorders and a myelodepresant effect. Besides, both AZT 
and DDI exhibit a remarkable proliferation-inhibiting effect 
on cells primarily infected with HIV, but have no effect on 
cells already infected with HIV. Therefore, these agents 
have been said that although they have an effect to prevent 
an attack of AIDS-related complex and a life-prolonging 
effect on patients, they have no effect to suppress cells 
infected with HIV, namely, they are useless for basic  
 
treatment for AIDS. It is accordingly an object of the present invention 
to provide an anti-HIV agent which has a marked 
proliferation-inhibiting effect on cells persistently 
infected with HIV, to say nothing of cells primarily 
infected with HIV and is useful for treatment for AIDS after 
infection. The present invention is directed to an anti-HIV agent 
comprising, as an active ingredient, a disulfide represented 
by the following general formula (1):

R¹-S-S-R²   (1)


 
wherein R¹ means an alkenyl group having 2-20 carbon atoms, 
and R² denotes an alkenyl group having 2-20 carbon atoms or 
an alkyl group having 1-20 carbon atoms, or an unsaturated 
alcohol or an ester thereof represented by the following 
general formula (2):

R¹-O-R³   (2)


 
wherein R¹ means an alkenyl group having 2-20 carbon atoms, 
and R³ denotes a hydrogen atom, an acyl group having 2-20 
carbon atoms, a phosphoric group or a phospholipid group. The present invention is also directed to a 
prophylactic and remedial preparation for AIDS, comprising, 
as an active ingredient, a compound represented by the 
general formula (1) or (2). The present invention is further directed to use of a  
 
compound represented by the general formula (1) or (2) for 
an anti-HIV agent or a prophylactic and remedial preparation 
for AIDS. The present invention is still further directed to a 
method of inhibiting the proliferation of
