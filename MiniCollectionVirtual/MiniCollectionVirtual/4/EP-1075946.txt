engraving can be engraved into the plate (14, 36) and with
which, on the other hand, the object to be printed on or

the printed object or another object can be engraved being
located upstream of the inking apparatus (12), and a

transport means being provided with which the plate (14,
36) can be transported from the laser engraving means (22)
