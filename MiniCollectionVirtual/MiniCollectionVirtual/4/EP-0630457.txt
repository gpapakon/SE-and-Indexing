<ABSTRACT>
A seal ring (4) and connection joint (1) for connecting and sealing conduits/pressure vessels (2, 3) and the like is disclosed. The seal ring comprises a sealing portion (5) having a pair of seal lips (6, 7) sloping radially outwardly to a web portion (8), the web portion extending radially outwardly to a spigot (9) having portions projecting transversely to the web. The thickness of the spigot in the radial direction (w) is substantially greater than the thickness of the web in the transverse direction (t), and the seal lips project transversely from the web by a distance (h) which is substantially greater than the thickness of the web in the transverse direction (t). This configuration provides improved seal characteristics. The joint (1) comprises the seal ring interposed at the interface between two conduit (or vessel) members (2, 3), the conduit or vessel members being provided with respective recesses (10, 11) arranged to receive the sealing lips and spigot of the seal ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seal ring and connection joint for conduits, 
pressure vessels or the like. When connecting adjacent sections of fluid flow conduits or vessels, seal rings 
are typically interposed at the interface of adjacent connecting flanged conduit or vessel 
portions which are then bolted together. Where high pressure or corrosive fluid is carried 
in the conduit or vessel, the seal ring used is typically metallic, the seal being effected by 
elastic or plastic deformation of a sealing surface of the seal ring against sealing portions of 
the flanged portions. Known seal rings and joints of the general type are disclosed, for example in 
U.K. patent specifications 742213, 854189, 952755, 1035958 and 1521546, and PCT 
specification WO91/19128. US-A-3 141 685 discloses an annular seal ring having a sealing portion joined integrally to a spigot portion by a web portion. We have now devised an improved seal ring and associated connection joint. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an annular seal 
ring comprising an integrally formed sealing portion, spigot portion and interconnecting web 
portion, said sealing portion comprising a pair of annular seal lips facing the spigot portion 
and extending in a transverse direction to said web portion, which web portion extends 
radially outwardly from said pair of seal lips to said spigot portion, which spigot portion is 
provided with spigot projections projecting in mutually opposed directions transversely to the 
web portion, wherein the thickness of said spigot portion in the radial direction is 
substantially greater than the thickness of the web portion in the transverse direction, and 
each respective seal lip is arranged to project transversely from said web portion by a 
distance which is substantially greater than the thickness of said web portion in said 
transverse direction. It is preferred that the thickness of the spigot portion in the radial direction is 
substantially greater than the thickness of the web in the transverse direction over 
substantially the whole transverse extent of the spigot portion.  
 The pair of annular seal lips are preferably arranged each on a respective 
radially outer portion of the sealing portion, and advantageously slope radially outwardly and 
toward one another to the web portion. It is preferred that each spigot projection is provided with a respective first 
transverse face portion facing a respective seal lip, which transverse face portion is 
advantageously

<CLAIMS>
An annular seal ring comprising an integrally formed sealing portion (5), spigot portion (9) 
and interconnecting web portion (8), said sealing portion comprising a pair of annular 

seal lips (6,7) facing the spigot portion and extending in a transverse direction to said web 
portion, which web portion extends radially outwardly from said pair of seal lips to 

said spigot portion, which spigot portion is provided with spigot projections projecting 
in mutually opposed directions transversely to the web portion, wherein the thickness (w) 

of said spigot portion in the radial direction is substantially greater than the thickness (t) 
of the web portion in the transverse direction, and each respective seal lip is arranged 

to project transversely from said web portion by a distance (h) which is substantially 
greater than the thickness of said web portion in said transverse direction. 
A seal ring according to claim 1, wherein said pair of annular seal lips slope radially 
outwardly and toward one another to said web portion and/or are provided on 

respective radially outer portions of the sealing portion. 
A seal ring according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the thickness of the spigot 
portion in the radial direction is substantially greater than the thickness of the web in 

the transverse direction over substantially the whole transverse extent of the spigot 
portion and/or wherein the spigot portion projects transversely from the web portion 

at least as far as the sealing lips project transversely from the web portion. 
A seal ring according to any preceding claim, wherein each spigot projection is 
provided with a respective first transverse face portion facing a respective seal lip, 

said respective first face portion being preferably disposed substantially perpendicular 
to the radial direction. 
A seal ring according to claim 4, wherein each spigot projection is provided with a 
respective second transverse face portion spaced from the respective first transverse 

face position and facing in an opposed direction thereto, the first and second 
transverse face portions provided on each spigot projection being typically 

substantially parallel to one another.  
 
A seal ring according to claim 5, wherein the second transverse faces comprise the 
radially outermost extent of the seal ring. 
A seal ring according to any preceding claim, wherein the respective spigot 
projections are provided in the region of their transversely projecting limits with 

respective tapered or chamfered portions, and/or wherein the web portion is provided 

with substantially parallel opposed radially extending surfaces. 
A conduit joint comprising a seal ring according to any of claims 1 to 7, interposed 
at an interface between a pair of conduit or vessel defining members, said members 

being provided at said interface with respective recessed portions complementarily 
shaped and dimensioned to receive respective portions of the spigot portion, and the 

sealing portion of the seal ring, respectively, wherein a first one of said recessed 
portions comprises an annular groove having substantially parallel radially spaced 

sidewalls, and a second one of said recessed portions comprises an annular surface 
sloping away from said interface in an inwardly radial direction. 
A conduit joint according to claim 8, wherein the annular groove comprises first 
recess portion is provided with substantially parallel radially spaced sidewalls which 

are configured substantially perpendicularly to the radial direction and/or wherein the 
radially outermost sidewall of the annular groove is substantially more extensive in
