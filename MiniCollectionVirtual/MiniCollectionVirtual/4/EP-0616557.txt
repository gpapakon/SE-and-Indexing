<ABSTRACT>
Centrifugal separator comprising a rotor, which forms an inlet chamber, a separation chamber (5) and an outlet chamber (10), in which a liquid separated during operation forms a rotating liquid body with a radially inwards directed free liquid surface, and a stationary discharge device (17) and means (20), which are arranged to entrain during the operation of the rotor the liquid present in the outlet chamber (10) in the rotation of the rotor and to admit flow of such liquid radially outwards to an inlet (19) in the discharge device (17). In order to entrain the liquid in the outlet chamber (10) efficiently and to admit flow of the liquid radially outwards to the inlet (19) with a small risk of air admixture, said means (20) comprise a number of elongated elements distributed around the rotational axis and rotating with the rotor, which between themselves form flow spaces, which extend axially, radially and in the circumferential direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a centrifugal separator comprising a rotor,
which forms a inlet chamber for liquid mixture of components, a separation chamber
connected to the inlet chamber, an outlet chamber, which via a passage communicates
with the separation chamber for the reception of a liquid separated in the separation
chamber during operation of the rotor, and which is so designed that liquid present
therein during operation forms a rotating liquid body with a radially inwards directed
free liquid surface. The centrifugal separator also comprises a stationary discharge
device extending radially inwardly from the said liquid body to a central outlet, at
least one outlet channel being formed in the discharge device one end of the outlet
channel having an inlet located in said liquid body, and the other end of the outlet
channel opening into an outlet connected to the discharge device. Furthermore, the
centrifugal separator comprises elongate elements connected to the rotor for
entraining separated liquid present in the outlet chamber to rotate with the rotary
during operation of the rotor, said members defining there between spaces extending
in the axial and radial directions to permit flow of said liquid in said directions in the
outlet chamber for said liquid to flow to the inlet of the outlet channel, said elongate elements
being distributed in a group disposed around the rotational axis.In a known centrifugal separator of this kind said passage from the
separation chamber opens into the outlet chamber at a level radially inside the free
liquid surface. As described in WO 89/03250, in the outlet chamber a number of
elongate elements in the form of wings are fixedly connected to extend axially
between the end walls of the chamber and radially inwardly from the circumferential 
wall of the outlet chamber. Separated liquid entering the outlet chamber is hereby
thrown radially outwards and collides either directly with the free liquid surface or
with one of said wings thereafter to be thrown further radially outwards to the free
liquid surface. The flow of the separated liquid radially outwards in the rotating
liquid body to the inlet of the outlet channel takes place mainly in thin layers along
the wings and one of the end walls of the outlet chamber.The described collision between the separated liquid and the free liquid
surface, or between the liquid and a wing, result in splashes, which means there is a
great risk of air or gas, which is located radially inside the free liquid surface in the
out
