<ABSTRACT>
A Raman amplifier comprises a pumping light producing means (1) for producing pumping lights. The pumping lights are
multiplexed with a signal light propagated through an optical fiber (2) so as to give the signal light a Raman gain. The means (1) is

constituted of a semiconductor laser of Fabri-Perot, DFB, or DBR type and an MOPA (3). The center wavelengths of the pumping lights are
different from each other, and the intervals between them are 6 nm to 35 nm. An optical repeater provided in an optical fiber transmission

line (8) compensates the loss caused by the optical fiber transmission line (8) and includes the Raman amplifier (9) used for the
compensation. A Raman amplification method for Raman-amplifying a signal light by sending the signal light and pumping lights having

mutually different center wavelengths through an optical fiber serving as a Raman-amplification medium, in which the power of the
pumping light having a shorter wavelength is higher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Raman amplifier capable of
being used for amplification of optical signal in various optical
communication systems, and optical repeater and Raman amplification
method using such a Raman amplifier, and more particularly, it relates to
Raman amplifier, optical repeater and Raman amplification method suitable
for amplification of wavelength division multiplexing signals.Almost all of optical amplifiers used with present optical fiber
communication systems are rare earth doped fiber amplifiers. Particularly,
erbium doped optical fiber amplifier (referred to as "EDFA" hereinafter)
using Er (erbium) doped fibers have been used frequently. However, a
practical gain wavelength band of the EDFA has a range from about 1530 nm
to 1610 nm (refer to "Electron. Lett," vol.33, no.23, pp.1967-1968).
Further, the EDFA includes gain having wavelength dependency, and, thus,
when it is used with wavelength division multiplexing signals, difference in
gain is generated in dependence upon a wavelength of optical signal. Fig.
23 shows an example of gain wavelength dependency of the EDFA.
Particularly, in wavelength bands smaller than 1540 nm and greater than
1560 nm, change in gain regarding the wavelength is great. Accordingly, in
order to obtain given gain (in almost cases, gain deviation is within 1 dB) in
the entire band including such wavelength, a gain flattening filter is used. The gain flattening filter is a filter designed so that loss is
increased in a wavelength having great gain, and the loss profile has a shape
substantially the same as that of the gain profile. However, As shown in
Fig. 24, in the EDFA, when magnitude of average gain is changed, since the
gain profile is also changed as shown by curves a, b and c, in this case, the
optimum loss profile of the gain flattening filter is also changed.
Accordingly, when the flattening is realized by a gain flattening filter having
fixed loss profile, if the gain of the EDFA is changed, the flatness will be
worsened.On the other hand, among optical amplifiers, there is an amplifier
referred to as a Raman amplifier utilizing Raman scattering of an optical
fiber (refer to "Nonlinear Fiber Optics, Academic Press). The Raman
amplifier has peak gain in frequency smaller than frequency of pumping
light by about 13 THz. In the following description, it is assumed that
pumping light having 1400 nm band is used, and the frequency smaller by
about 13 THz will be expressed as wavelength longer by about 100 nm.
Fig. 25 shows wavelength
