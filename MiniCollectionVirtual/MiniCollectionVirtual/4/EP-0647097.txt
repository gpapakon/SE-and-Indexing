<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention comprises a dry flowable
agricultural composition of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine
(defined hereinafter as glyphosate) with and without a
sulfonylurea herbicide and processes for the
preparation of the composition without a drying step.WO 91/13546 discloses the preparation of dry
flowable agricultural compositions comprising an active
ingredient, binder and chemical stabilizer. Among the
active ingredients disclosed are various sulfonylureas
and N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate) with a
disclosure that one or more may be used.While generally useful for granulation without
drying, WO 91/13546 would not be useful for processing
wetcake glyphosate or wet glyphosate salt without
treatment according to the present invention.WO 90/07275 describes the preparation of glyphosate
compositions or glyphosate salt granule compositions
containing liquid surfactants. The ability to utilize
a co-herbicide in the compositions is disclosed, and
several sulfonylurea herbicides, including metsulfuron
methyl, are specifically named.The processes of the prior art have the
disadvantage of requiring a drying step at some stage
of production of the formulations disclosed and because
the final products contain environmentally-sensitive
chemicals such as sulfonylureas and other potentially
volatile components, large and expensive air-purification
systems are necessary in drying operations
to prevent untoward chemical release. The compositions of the invention are dry flowable granular
agricultural compositions comprising glyphosate or
glyphosate salt with a sulfonylurea. The process of
the invention produces a free flowing granular
composition without a drying step by heating. The
resulting granules can also be described as free
flowing, non-caking, low attrition glyphosate
compositions.A process for the preparation of a dry flowable
agriculturally suitable granular composition whose pH when
measured by a 1% by weight aqueous solution of the
composition is 4 or higher which comprises a process
selected from process A and process B, said process A
comprising
(a) blending the following ingredients
(1) 1-70% wet glyphosate or wet glyphosate
salt,(2) 0.1-40% of an anhydrous base salt,(3) 0-10% of an anti-caking agent, and(4) 0-1% of an anti-foaming agent to form a
mixture I,(b) milling mixture I to form a powder,(c) blending the powder with 5-30% of a heat
activated binder,(d) heating to 60°-70°C, and(e) cooling to 50°C or lower, and
said process B comprising(f) blending 0.1-40% of an anhydrous base salt
with
