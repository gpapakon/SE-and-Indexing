<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to a
radiographic image systems and more particularly to a
radiographic image workstation for displaying
radiographic images and to a technique for changing the
tonal characteristics of a displayed image through
real-time window/leveling.Portable x-ray images are used to aid in
assessing pathological changes and/or tube/line
placement in critically ill patients in the U.S. Over
50% of portable examinations are performed in Critical
Care Units (Intensive Care and Coronary Care). The
remaining portable exams are performed on the medical
or surgical floors or in the Emergency Room. Most
patients in a Critical Care Unit have an x-ray
procedure at least once per day. The primary portable
exam type is AP (anterior-posterior) chest (80% of
portable procedures) followed by abdomen and bone. The
portable chest radiography market is expected to grow
20% in the United States over the next 5 years.The technologist's problems in portable
radiography are well known: maneuverability of the
portable x-ray generator, carrying a large number of
cassettes, x-ray tube positioning and determination of
proper technique. The variability in positioning the
x-ray tube results in different techniques between
exams. This sometimes results in over or underexposure
so that the radiologist requires an exam to be
repeated. The average repeat rate is on the order of
5% to 10%.The films that are generated while the
patient is in a Critical Care Unit are kept in either
the radiology department or in the unit. Typically,
the most recent films are put on an alternator for easy
access and review. Consultation about the procedure 
occurs where the films are located, requiring either
the radiologist or the clinician to go to the films.
At some institutions, a double film protocol is used in
order to give both the radiologist and clinician easier
access to the image.As radiologists read portable exams, the most
current film is compared to previous films to assess
changes in the patient's condition. The variability in
exposure with current film/screen combinations adds to
the difficulty in the assessment of changes that are
due to illness.The clinicians in the Critical Care area
often need immediate access to the portable films in
order to check proper tube placement. They often
"borrow" the film from the radiology department before
the radiologist has a chance to read it. Sometimes
these films are not returned and a report is not
generated; thus the hospital has lost revenue for that
exam.As the population

Digital image processing apparatus 202
comprising:


a memory (302) for storing digital
medical images and image processing look-up tables,

including a window/level look-up table (lut) having
selectively variable parameters and a gamma lut;
an image display (300) having an image
display area and a non-image display area;
a digital control (304) for controlling
the memory (302) and the image display (300); and
a user input device (306), (308) for
inputting commands to the digital control;

characterised in
a hardware color lut memory (312) coupled

between the memory (302) and the image display (300) and controlled by said digital control (304);

wherein, in a first mode, a user inputs
a command through the user input device (306), (308) to

display a medical image from the memory (302) on the
image display (300), the digital control (304) cascades

the window/level lut and the gamma lut into an image
display lut; stores the image display lut in the

hardware color lut memory (312), while reserving color
cells used in the non-image area of the image display

(300) to avoid value changes of the non-image display area; and displays the medical image from the memory
(302) in the image area of the image display (300)

after the image is passed through the hardware color
lut memory (312); and
wherein in a second mode, a user inputs
a command through the user input device (306), (308) to

selectively change the parameters of the window/level
lut, the digital control (304) changes the window/level

lut as a function of the changed parameters, cascades
the changed window/level lut with the gamma lut into a

changed image display lut; stores the changed image
display lut the hardware color lut memory (312); and 

redisplays the medical image in the image display area
of the image display (300), with the changed

window/level parameters, without changing the displayed
values of the non-image display area.
The apparatus (202) of claim 1 wherein
the memory (302) stores digital radiographic images

from a digital radiographic source, such as a
diagnostic scanner, a storage phosphor reader, a

radiographic film digitizer.
The apparatus (202) of claim 2 wherein
the image processing look-up tables stored in the

memory (302) include a preference lut; and wherein, in
the first and second modes, the digital control (304)

cascades the preference lut, the window/level lut, and
the gamma lut into the image display lut.
The apparatus (202) of claim 3 wherein
the preference lut stored in the memory (302) includes

a normal white-bone lut, a black-bone lut, and a high
contrast lut.
The apparatus (202) of claim 1 wherein
the digital control (304) includes a digital computer

(304).
