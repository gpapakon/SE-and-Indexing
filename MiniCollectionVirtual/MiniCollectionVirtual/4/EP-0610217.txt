<ABSTRACT>
Improved fines retention in a paper making process may be employed by using as the binder a combination of natural hectorite and a medium/high molecular weight cationic polymer having an intrinsic viscosity in the range 5 to 25 dl/g and having a charge density of from 0.01 to 5 equivalents of cationic nitrogen per kilogram. The polymer is added to the furnish which is then subjected to high shear before adding the hectorite.

 IMPROVEMENT? IN PAPER MftKINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to paper making. In particular, it relates to a multi- component system for improving wet-end chemistry in paper making.2. Brief Description of the Prior ArtIn order to try to reduce the cost of paper and modify certain paper properties various expedients have been tried. Among these have been attempts to replace cellulosic fibers by filler materials such as kaolin clays. It has, however, proved to be difficult to maintain satisfactory quality, especially as the ratio of filler to fiber is increased.Currently, many paper makers attempt to maximize filler and pulp fines retention by addition of a high molecular weight water soluble polymer, such as a derivatized polyacrylamide in an amount of from 0.3 to 1.5 lbs per ton of paper produced. The derivatized polyacrylamide used may be cationic or anionic in nature and in general it has been found that the higher the molecular weight of the material used, the greater has been the retention. On the other hand, as the molecular weight of the polyacrylamide increases, sheet formation deteriorates. Similarly, as the amount of polyacrylamide is increased, fines retention 

 improves and sheet formation deteriorates.A further problem confronted by paper makers is the removal of water from the furnish slurry when this is passed from the headbox of a paper making machine on to the moving wire belt on which paper sheet forms. Initially, water simply drains through the wire belt. As the belt progresses away from the headbox, the furnish slurry, from which the paper is forming, is subjected to additional drainage techniques such as vacuum assisted drainage. After this, the paper now has sufficient structural integrity to be removed from the wire belt and passed over heated rollers which lowers the moisture content even further to produce the finished product. The greater the amount of moisture that drains off on the initial section, namely the wire belt, the less is the cost of subsequent drying operations. Such early removal of water can be assisted by the presence of suitable drainage aids in the furnish. Low to intermediate molecular weight cationic synthetic polymers such as those based on polyacrylamide, polyethylene imine, polymers produced from dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin and polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride are examples of drainage aids currently in use.Binder compositions comprising acrylic polymers are described, for example, in U.S.
