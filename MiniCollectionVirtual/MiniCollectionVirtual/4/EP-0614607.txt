<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to herbicidal treatments and compositions using a mixture of a
thiocarbamate herbicide and the compound (E)-methyl
2-[2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate, (compound A)
which show synergistic or other activity enhancing effects.Many thiocarbamate herbicides are known, for example prosulfocarb, cycloate,
vernolate, molinate, thiobencarb, butylate*, EPTC*, tri-allate, di-allate, esprocarb and
tiocarbazil (* these compounds are preferably employed in combination with a safener such as
dichlormid).Compound A is a known compound as described in the proceedings of the Brighton
Crop Protection Conference - Pests and Diseases 1992 p 435-442, and EP 382375.The applicants have found that the application of a mixture of a thiocarbamate selected
from prosulfocarb, cycloate, vernolate, molinate, thiobencarb, butylate, EPTC, tri-allate, di-allate,
esprocarb and tiocarbazil, in combination with compound A produces a greater
herbicidal effect against weed species than would be expected taking into account the
activities of each of the compounds alone, and does not adversely affect the photoxicity
towards the crop species.According to the present invention there is provided a herbicidal preparation
comprising a thiocarbamate selected from prosulfocarb, cycloate, vernolate, molinate.
thiobencarb, butylate, EPTC, tri-allate, di-allate, esprocarb and tiocarbazil in combination with
the compound (E)-methyl 2-[2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate.A preferred thiocarbamate is prosulfocarb.The preparations of the invention have useful herbicidal activity. They are capable of
controlling the growth of a variety of plants including grass weeds e.g. Alopecurusmyosuroides,
broad-leaved weeds e.g. Galiumaparine, Chenopodiumalbum and sedges e.g.
Cyperusspp, in a wide range of situations such as agriculture and horticulture, forestry and
amenity. They may be used on a wide range of crops such as maize, sugar beet, rice and small
grain cereals. The compounds are preferably applied to the ground before the growing plants have
germinated (pre-emergence application) or by pre-plant incorporation or by post-emergence
application.In another aspect therefore, the invention provides a process of inhibiting the growth
of unwanted plants, by applying to the plants, or to the locus thereof, a thiocarbamate selected
from prosulfocarb, cycloate, vernolate, molinate, thiobencarb, butylate, EPTC, tri-allate, di-allate,
esprocarb and tiocarbazil, and compound A.The
