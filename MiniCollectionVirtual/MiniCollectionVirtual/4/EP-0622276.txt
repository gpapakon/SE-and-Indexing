A gas bag restraining system adapted to be mounted in a 
cover part (10) of a vehicle steering wheel, comprising said 

cover part (10), a supporting plate (18) adapted to be 
mounted in the cover part (10), and a gas generator 

(16) comprising a housing and being secured on said 
supporting plate (18), said gas generator together with said 

supporting plate (18) forming a preassembled first unit, 
further comprising a folded gas bag (12) having an inflation 

opening (121) and an anchoring plate (14) for the gas bag 
(12), said anchoring plate being provided with fastener 

bolts (22) and having an opening (142) directed toward said 
inflation opening (121), said gas generator (16) having a 

housing part extending through said opening (142) in said 
anchoring plate (14) and through said inflation opening 

(121) into said folded gas bag (12), said fastener bolts 
(22), in a mounted state of said gas bag restraining system, 

engaging into through-openings (20) in said supporting plate 
(18) and said anchoring plate (14) being clampable to said 

supporting plate (18) by means of nuts (42) which can be 
screwed onto said fastening bolts (22), said folded gas bag 

(12) and said anchoring plate (14) forming a second 
preassembled unit, characterized in that said first unit is 

formed by securing said gas generator in a recess (28) of 
said supporting plate (18) into which it is inserted, by 

means of wall parts (282) of said supporting plate (18) which 
are caulked radially inwards. 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized in that said cover (10) is provided with wall  

 
parts (30, 31) which are bent inwards and clamped between 

said anchoring plate (14) and said supporting plate (18). 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in claim 2, 
characterized in that saind bent wall parts (30, 31) are 

provided with through-openings (34) for said fastener bolts 
(22). 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in any of the 
above claims, characterized in that said generally square 

supporting plate (18) is provided with formed fastener tabs 

(24). 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in any of the 
above claims, characterized in that said gas bag (12) is 

held together in folded condition by a wrapping film (40). 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in claim 2 and 
in claim 2 and any of the claims 3 thru 5, characterized 

in that said bent wall parts (30, 31) of said cover (10) are 
provided with an edge strip (301, 311) engaging said recess 

(28) of said supporting plate (18). 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in claim 6, 
characterized in that said edge strip (311) of each bent 

wall part (31) is elongated in the circumferential direction 
of said gas generator (12) and suitably engages a recess of 

a neighboring wall part (30) of said cover (10). 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in any of the 
above claims, characterized in that said cover (10) forms 

the impact plate of a steering wheel. 
A gas bag restraining system as set forth in claim 3 or 
in claim 3 and any of the claims 4 thru 8, characterized in 

that said through-openings (34) of said wall parts (30) each 
feature a restriction (38) clamping said fastener bolts 

(22).
