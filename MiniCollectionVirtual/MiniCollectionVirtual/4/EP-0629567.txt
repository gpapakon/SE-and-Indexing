<ABSTRACT>
A load positioning and conveying system (10) includes a plurality of 
groups of elongate conveyors (12,14), wherein each group includes at 

least two conveyor (12a,12b,12c;14a,14b,14c) slats. A conveyor drive 
mechanism (18,20) includes a first drive unit (18) connected to one end 

of the conveyor slats (12,14) and a second drive unit (20) connected to 
the other end of the conveyor slats (12,14). Each drive unit (18,20) is 

constructed and arranged for selective, simultaneous and independent 
longitudinal shifting of the conveyor slats (12,14) in a single, 

predetermined direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to load conveying systems,
and specifically to a type of load conveying system which
is known as a moving floor.Moving floors are used in a variety of material
handling environments, such as warehouses and in over-the-road
trailers which are used in the trucking industry. A
basic concept of a moving floor or reciprocating conveyor
is disclosed in my U.S. Patent No. 4,143,760, for
RECIPROCATING CONVEYOR, which describes a moving floor
system having a plurality of groups of elongated slats. In
that system, a hydraulic drive is operable to move all of
the slats of each group from a start position
simultaneously in a load-conveying direction, and then to
move the slats of each group sequentially in the opposite
direction from the advanced position back to the start
position. In this fashion a load is conveyed in a
predetermined direction.I subsequently developed an improved conveyor which
had three pairs of opposed hydraulic drives which drove the
elongated slats from both a forward and rearward end of the
trailer. This system is disclosed in my published European
Patent Application EP-A-0 158,398.Known reciprocating conveyor systems utilize rigid
slats which are normally formed of extruded aluminum. The
hydraulic drive system typically takes the form of a
plurality of hydraulic cylinders, each of which is mounted
to a transversely extending drive beam or cross drive, to
which are mounted each of the slats of that group. Other
forms which the drive system may take include a
reciprocating rod extending between a pair of fixed
cylinders, or a single cylinder mounted to reciprocate on a
fixed shaft. With these systems the cross drives are
mounted to the reciprocating rod or to the reciprocating
cylinder, respectively, and the slats of each group are
mounted to one of the cross drives.Slat type conveyor systems have been extremely
successful in providing a trailer-mounted loading and 
unloading capability for a reasonable expense, while
taking up little space in the trailer. However,
because the slats must extend the entire length of the
trailer, and cover most of the floor thereof, even when
a light weight material such as aluminum is used, the
weight of the conveyor system is substantial. Also,
because the load to be carried is often dropped onto
the slats in the trailer, the slats will on occasion be
damaged, thereby rendering the system inoperable.
Also, when consideration is given to the amount of
aluminum which must be used, the expense of the slats
comprises a substantial
