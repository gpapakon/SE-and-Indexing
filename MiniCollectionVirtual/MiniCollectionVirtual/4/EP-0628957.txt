<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an optical information recording medium 
of the type which comprises a substrate and a recording layer formed on 

the substrate, the substrate comprising an injection molded piece of a polycarbonate 
resin composition having a releasing agent content of 0.005 to 

0.5 % by weight of a fatty acid ester having a hydroxyl value of not greater 
than 5 mg of KOH/g and a thermal stabilizer content of not greater than 5 

ppm. When the polycarbonate resin or its composition is injection molded, 
the resin temperature is defined in a certain range, by which hydrolysis of 

the polycarbonate resin can be prevented. Thus, the medium has a reduced 

number of defects and long-term reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical information recording 
mediums such as magneto-optic disks, various write-once 
optical disks, and digital audio disks or so-called compact 
disks. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved 
optical information recording medium wherein an 
injection molded piece of a polycarbonate resin is used as a 
substrate for the medium. In optical information recording mediums wherein information 
is recorded and reproduced by irradiation of a laser beam, such 
as magneto-optic disks, various write-once optical disks, 
erasable optical disks and digital audio disks, typically a 
polycarbonate resin injection molded article or piece is used as 
the substrate. Injection molded pieces of polycarbonate resins 
provide a number of advantages. They have a good heat 
resistance, are easily subsequently molded, suffer less 
deformation and undergo little change in quality after the 
molding process, and have good mechanical characteristics such as 
impact resistance. Further, compared to glass substrates, the 
polycarbonate resin pieces are more conducive to mass-production 
and are thus less expensive. Frequently metal-based recording materials are used as the 
information recording layer of the optical information recording 
mediums; typical the recording layer is a rare earth 
element-transition metal amorphous alloy film as used in 
magneto-optic disks. Accordingly, a major problem that is 
encountered in practical applications is how to increase the 
resistance of the metal layer to corrosion.  
 In view of the above, optical information recording mediums 
based on substrates of injection molded polycarbonate resin have 
not always performed satisfactory with respect to the long-term 
reliability of the information recording medium. For instance, 
when stored at high temperatures and high humidity, the recording 
film or reflection film often corrodes. Corrosion brings about a 
failure in reproduction due to the increase in error rate, 
presenting a great obstacle in guaranteeing reliability. Where polycarbonate resins are injection molded and used as 
a substrate, the usual practice is to add releasing agents. 
Releasing agents are necessary to ensure that the product's 
resistance to being released from the mold is not great or the 
resultant pieces will suffer warpage or optical strain. Known releasing agents used for polycarbonate resins include 
paraffin, silicone oils, fatty acid esters, partial esters of 
fatty acids (especially, fatty acid monoglycerides) and
