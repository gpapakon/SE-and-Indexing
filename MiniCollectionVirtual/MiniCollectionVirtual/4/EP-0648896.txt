<ABSTRACT>
This water guide strip comprises a flexible prefabricated body (1) based on ground rubber particles, in particular recycled ground rubber, and rock granulates or ground plastic waste, these particles and these granulates or this ground waste being agglomerated by a binder, the said strip being bonded onto the surfacing of the roadway. Application to the verges of motorways.

<CLAIMS>
Lateral water guidance buffer for roads,
characterised in that it consists of a supple prefabricated

body (1) with a base of ground rubber, notably recycled
ground rubber particles and rock aggregates or ground waste

plastic material. These particles and these aggregates, or
this ground waste are conglomerated with a binder and the

proportions per unit volume of the particles of rubber and
the rock aggregates or the said ground waste close to one

another. The said buffer can be stuck to the road surface.
Buffer following claim 1,characterised in that the
binding agent is a polymer with a polyurethane base.
Buffer following claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the size distribution of the particles of ground

rubber and the rock aggregates or the said ground waste are
close, notably in the region of 2 to 5 mm.
Buffer following any of the claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the quantity of binding agent

represents about 7% of the total body (1) volume of the
buffer.
Buffer following any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the body (1) is in continuous

sections. 
Buffer following any of the claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the cross section of the body (1)

consists of a face tilted (2) notably at 45Â°, towards the
middle of the road.
Buffer following claim 6, characterised in that
the cross section of the b
ody (1) is trapezoid.
Water guidance device for roads, consisting of a
buffer following any of claims 1 to 7, stuck to the road

surface by means of a glue which is a bitumen with an
incorporated elastomer and combines directly with the body

of the buffer.
Device following claim 8, characterised in that at
least in the areas in which it is curved, the buffer (1) is

further held on the road by mechanical instruments.
