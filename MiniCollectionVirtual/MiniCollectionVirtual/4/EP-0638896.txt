<ABSTRACT>
An optical pickup apparatus for a magneto-optical 
recording medium (6) on which a wobbling track is formed 

includes a light source (1), an objective lens (5) and a 
polarization beam splitter (3). The light source (1) emits 

a linearly polarized diverging light beam. The objective 
lens converges (5) the light beam emitted by the light 

source (1) onto a magneto-optical recording medium (6) and 
converges light reflected from the magneto-optical recording 

medium (6). The polarization beam splitter (3) is disposed 
in a divergent/convergent light path(11) between the light 

source (1) and the objective lens (5)and separates the 
reflected light beam from the magneto-optical recording 

medium (6) from the divergent/convergent light path (11). 
The light source (1) is disposed so that the plane of 

polarization of the light beam emitted by the light 
source (1) is normal to the track of the magneto-optical 

recording medium (6). The polarization beam splitter (3) is 
disposed so that the plane which includes the component of 

the reflected light beam from the magneto- optical recording 
medium (6) corresponding to the component of the light beam 

emitted by the light source (1) which is on the optical axis 
and also includes the component of the light separated from 

the divergent/convergent light path (11) which is said 
reflected light beam component separated from the 

divergent/convergent light path (11) is normal to the track 
of the magneto-optical recording medium (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical pickup for a
magneto-optical recording medium, and particularly to an
optical pickup for a magneto-optical recording medium having
wobbling tracks.Information is recorded on a magneto-optical recording
medium such as for example a magneto-optical disc by the
Curie point recording method wherein the recording layer of
the magneto-optical recording medium is magnetized
perpendicularly in correspondence with the information being
recorded. In the Curie point recording method, information
is recorded on a magneto-optical recording medium by applying
to the magneto-optical recording medium a magnetic field
perpendicular thereto while heating the magneto-optical
recording medium to above the Curie temperature with a light
beam.Information recorded on a magneto-optical disc serving
as a magneto-optical recording medium is reproduced in the
way shown in Fig. 1.That is, a linearly polarized light beam emitted by for 
example a laser diode 200 is reflected by the reflecting
surface of a polarization beam splitter (PBS) 201 and enters
an objective lens 202. This light beam is then converged by
an objective lens 202 onto a magneto-optical disc D and is
reflected. At this time, due to the so-called magnetic Kerr
effect, the plane of polarization of the light beam is
rotated to the right or to the left (by an angle k or -k),
according to the direction of the magnetization of the
magneto-optical disc D.The reflected light beam from the disc D whose plane of
polarization has been rotated through for example k by this
magnetic Kerr effect passes through the objective lens 202
and enters and is transmitted through the PBS 201. At this
time the rotation angle of the plane of polarization of the
reflected light beam from the disc D is amplified by the
polarization characteristics of the PBS 201.That is, considering two orthogonal polarization
components (which here will be called the x, y polarization
components), and supposing that the PBS 201 has polarization
characteristics such that the transmittance Tx of the x
polarization component is 1 (=100%) and the transmittance Ty
of the y polarization component is a predetermined value less
than 1, as shown in Fig. 1 the light beam being transmitted
through the PBS 201 causes the y polarization component only,
of the polarization components, to be multiplied by Ty (<1.0) 
and become smaller. As a result, as shown in Fig. 1, the
rotation angle of the plane of polarization is amplified from
k to the greater 'k.The reflected light beam
