<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method of destroying an undersea object, such as, for example, a bottom mine (MF) or a tethered mine, which includes a step of detection and/or of identification of the object, including the use of means for detection and/or identification of the object at a distance greater than a minimum defined distance, called safety distance, and a step of destruction of the object, with the aid of a pyrotechnic charge (CAM), the explosion of which, for example, causes the explosion and the fragmentation of the mine, the destruction step consisting, from intermediate undersea equipment (EF) having previously reached the bottom, in employing a charge (CAM) which comes up to the object (MF), then in causing explosion of the charge (CAM), characterised in that the intermediate undersea equipment and the charge constitute a destruction unit (UD) which is placed in the water from a surface vessel (CM) or an aircraft, and which travels to the bottom along a path in the course of which its movements are remotely guided from a guidance station (CM).

Method of destruction of a submerged object for example a ground mine 
(MF) or a moored mine, which comprises an object detection and/or 

identification stage including the use of means for detection and/or identification 
of the object at a distance greater than a minimum predetermined distance, 

the so-called security distance, and an object destruction stage, which with 
the help of the explosion of a pyrotechnic charge (CAM) causes for example 

the explosion and fragmentation of the mine, or the action of pyrotechnic shears 
placed on the mooring of a moored mine, the destruction stage consisting of 

an intermediate submarine equipment, which having previously reached the 
bottom, uses a charge (CAM) which draws alongside the object (MF) , and 

then causes the charge (CAM) to explode, characterised in that the 
intermediate submarine equipment and the charge constitute a destruction 

unit (UD) which is launched from a surface vessel (CM) , or an 
aircraft, and which reaches the bottom by gravity according to a path 

which is controlled remotely from a guiding station via a data transmission 
cable. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the charge (CAM) is 
catapulted from the destruction unit which is beached on the bottom. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that 
the charge (CAM) is self-propelled and leaves the destruction unit 

(UD) by self-propulsion, the destruction unit being beached on the bottom. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the 
destruction unit, beached on the bottom, includes a self-propelling apparatus 

which travels along the bottom carrying the charge (CAM). 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the 
destruction unit (UD) which is beached on the bottom includes a means of 

propulsion of the charge (CAM). 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the destruction unit is 
equipped with a manipulator arm to manipulate the charge (CAM).  

 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the surface vessel or the aircraft includes means for detection and/or 

identification of the object. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the intermediate 
equipment made as part of the destruction unit (UD) may be salvaged prior 

to the command to explode the pyrotechnic charge. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the charge (CAM) is a hollow pyrotechnic charge.
