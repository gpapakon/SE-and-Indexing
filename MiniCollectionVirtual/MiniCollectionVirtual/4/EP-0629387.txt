<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention proposes a shaped sanitary towel 
for incontinence, which is characterized by its peculiar 
structure, remarkably increasing its practicality of 
use. More particularly the object is a sanitary towel to be 
worn under elastic panties and comprising, in its front 
part, two side wings coming out of the panties, so as to 
protect the skin thereby preventing inflammation and 
ensuring a perfect seal to liquids. The wings can be seized after the sanitary towel has 
been worn, in order to place it optimally. The sanitary towels for incontinence can be divided into 
two large categories: the panty-towels, which are worn 
directly and are provided with rubber bands suitable to 
hold them in their position, and shaped sanitary towels, 
to be worn under elastic panties having the function of 
holding them in their position. The products of the second category are cheaper than the 
others, because a much smaller quantity of material is 
needed, which material substantially affects the 
production cost. On the other hand, it often occurs that 
these shaped sanitary towels do not provide a perfect 
seal to liquids due to the difficulties of a correct  
 
positioning. The invention proposes a sanitary towel of the second 
type, that is to say a shaped sanitary towel to be worn 
under panties, which combines the advantages of a low 
production cost with the advantage of a perfect seal, 
due to the special structure of the parts which allows 
it to be easily and optimally positioned, so as to avoid 
the risk of leaks. Besides, the presence of the wings prevents the rubber 
band of the panties from coming into contact with the 
skin causing inflammation and reddening, which on the 
contrary occurs with the presently known sanitary 
towels. The present invention will be now described in detail, 
as an example, with reference to the enclosed figures 
where: 
Figure 1 illustrates the view from above on the sanitary 
towel according to the invention, completely open; Figures 2 and 3 are lateral views of the sanitary towel 
according to two orthogonal directions. With reference to Figure 3, the sanitary towel according 
to the invention comprises an outer layer 1 made of an 
impermeable material, preferably polythene, onto which a 
fluff or absorbing material 2 is applied, coated with a 
nonwoven fabric layer 3.  As is clearly visible from the plan view of Figure 1, 
the sanitary towel is of the shaped type, comprising two 
enlarged front and back "lobes" or parts, respectively 
indicated with numerals
