<ABSTRACT>
In order for the blocking and the unblocking of the amplifier to be performed in synchronism with the input signal (Vrf) of the amplifier, it is proposed to use the memory effect of the capacitive impedance (C) of the control inputs of each of the two blocking transistors (Q1) of the H bridge: in series with each of the control inputs, a first switch (K1,d1) and a semiconductor element (d2) are arranged in parallel, in such a way that the blocking of the blocking transistor is conditioned by the opening of the first switch (K1,d1) ordered by the blocking signal (Va), and by the direction of the charge carried by the said capacitive impedance (C); a second switch (K2) controlled by the alternations of the input signal (Vrf) allows the first one to be closed, and thus the unblocking of the blocking transistor in question (Q1) only for the alternations which this blocking transistor does not amplify. Application to power amplifier devices.

Power amplifier of the H-bridge type and its
blocking means, the amplifier having four transistors

(Q1-Q4), each constituting one branch of the bridge, a
blocking input (Ec) and four transformers (T1-T4) which

are associated respectively with the four transistors
so as to control them individually, each with a

secondary winding having a first terminal connected to
a control electrode of the associated transistor and a

second terminal (J), two of these second terminals
being blocking terminals coupled by the blocking means

to one and the same fixed-potential point,
characterized in that the blocking means include, on

the one hand, connected between each of the two
blocking terminals and the fixed-potential point, a

first switch (K1, d1) and a semiconductor element (d2)
which are connected in parallel, each first switch

having a control input coupled to the blocking input
(Ec) and, on the other hand, associated with each first

switch, a second switch (K2) coupled to the control
input of the first switch which is associated with it,

this second switch having a control input coupled to
that (J) of the blocking terminals to which the first

switch which is associated with it is connected.
Amplifier according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the transistors are MOSFET transistors.
Amplifier according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first switch consists

of the series connection of an additional transistor 
(K1) and a diode (d1), and in that the control input of

the first switch consists of one of the electrodes of
the additional transistor.
Amplifier according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the second switch is a transistor (K2) whose

three electrodes are, as regards two of them, in series
between the control input of the first switch (K1, d1)

and the fixed-potential point and, as regards the third
of them, the control input of the second switch.
Power amplifier device, characterized in that
it has at least two amplifiers with their blocking

means according to one of the preceding claims.
