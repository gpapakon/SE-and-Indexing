<ABSTRACT>
A guide device (1) includes a ram (2) and a
column (3) translatable axially relative to each other. The

ram (2) has an outer circumferential surface of a squared
cross section formed of four flat portions (20) each of which

extends axially. The column (3) disposed around the ram (2)
has a through hole (3a) of a squared cross section formed

of four flat portions (30) corresponding to the flat portions
(20) of the ram (2). In each flat portion (30) of the column

(3) is provided a needle bearing (5) that rolls on the
corresponding flat portion (20) of the ram (2). Inside the

column (3) are provided a plurality of supporting shafts (4)
extending in a direction perpendicular to the extending

direction or to the axial direction of each flat portion (20)
of the ram (2). Each needle bearing (5) is rotatably supported

by the corresponding supporting shaft (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a guide
device, and more particularly, to a linear guide device for
slidably supporting a column and a ram relative to each other.In press working, a die set is used to improve
working accuracy. The die set includes a punch holder to hold
a punch, a die holder disposed opposite the punch holder to
hold a die, and a guide post to slidably support each holder
in the axial direction. The guide post includes a post
extending vertically, a sleeve slidable around the post, and
a linear bearing interposed between the post and the sleeve.A prior-art linear bearing used for such a
guide post is, for example, a ball bearing having a multiple
steel balls received in a cylindrical retainer, or a needle
bearing having a multiple needles received in a tubular
retainer of a polygonal shaped cross section, as shown in
Japanese patent application laying-open publication No.
3-81035.In operation of the conventional guide post,
while the post reciprocates relative to the sleeve, or the
post enters and exits the sleeve repetitively, the retainer
tends to gradually move upwardly along the post. Therefore, 
it was necessary to consider travel range of the sleeve in
designing e.g. to determine the length of the sleeve in
estimation for travel range of the sleeve. Also, since the
retainer is generally made of plastics, when a greater
torsion occurs between the post and the sleeve, retaining
of the needles by the retainer becomes inadequate, which may
cause skewing of the needles. Additionally, needle bearings
were not suitable for dusty atmosphere because a needle has
such a small diameter that its smooth rotation may be hindered
when it bites dust or small particles on a rolling surface.An object of the present invention is to
provide a guide device having a retainerless linear motion
mechanism for supporting a ram and column slidable relative
to each other.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a guide device that can be used in a dusty atmosphere.A yet another object of the present invention
is to increase an allowable load of the guide device.A further object of the present invention is
to advance supporting rigidity of the guide device.A still further object of the present
invention is to facilitate working process, especially
boring of the guide device.The present invention relates to a guide
device for slidably supporting a ram and column. In one
embodiment, the ram includes an outer circumferential
surface of a polygonal cross section having a plurality of
ram flat
