<ABSTRACT>
Esters of monocarboxylic acids are 
transesterified with 1,2- and 1,3-polyols by reaction 

in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of 
a dialkyltin oxide blended with an excess of dialkyltin 

dichloride, so that a polyol ester of the 
monocarboxylic acid is formed. A transesterification 

reaction of alcohols and polyols with methyl or ethyl 
mono- or polycarboxylic acid esters utilizing a 

dimethyltin catalyst is also disclosed, in which the 
alcohol or polyol carboxylic acid ester formed is 

essentially free of the organotin catalyst. Carboxylic 
acid esters produced by the described methods, as well 

as carboxylic acid esters that are free of organotin 
catalysts are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for
producing higher esters of carboxylic acids by an
organotin catalyzed transesterification reaction
between lower alkyl esters of the carboxylic acid and
alcohols and polyols. In particular, the present
invention relates to novel methods for forming
heretofore unattainable 1,2- and 1,3-polyol esters by
organotin catalyzed transesterification. In addition,
the present invention relates to methods for
synthesizing such polyol esters, as well as other
polyol and alcohol esters, by organotin catalyzed
transesterification, and recovering the resulting
esters substantially free of the organotin catalyst.Esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids and of
aromatic polycarboxylic acids are of increasing
commercial importance as polymerizable monomers.
Materials of this nature are used to form both
homopolymers and copolymers; which have commercial uses
in many applications. Such applications include
coatings for paper products, waste water treatment
systems, optical lens coatings, floor polishes,
anaerobic adhesives, pour point depressants, paper
coatings, UV and EB coatings and adhesives, textile
finishes, pressure sensitive adhesives, viscosity index
improvers, potting compounds and sealants,
photopolymers for electronics and printing plates,
rubber and plastics modifiers, UV curable inks and
overprint varnishes, dental and medical resins,
reactive diluents for radiation curable oligomers,
crosslinkers for rubber vulcanization, moisture barrier
films, ion exchange resins, PVC plastisols,
encapsulation and impregnation of small diameter
spheres, leather finishes, binder resins for sand
castings, UV curable resins for imaging systems, silane
intermediates, and the like; such applications being
well known to those skilled in the art. One group of monomers of particular interest
are the polyfunctional monomers; that is to say, esters
of unsaturated carboxylic acids with polyfunctional
alcohols. As is also well known to those skilled in
the art, materials of this nature can be used as crosslinking
agents to form rigid coatings which are
insoluble in normally-used solvents. Of particular
interest are the esters of acrylic acid (2-propenoic
acid) and methacrylic acid (2-methyl-2-propenoic acid).
These esters, both monofunctional and polyfunctional,
have long been used as components of homopolymers
and/or copolymers for the applications described above.Another group of monomers of particular
interest are the unsaturated esters of aromatic
polycarboxylic acids. The polymerization
