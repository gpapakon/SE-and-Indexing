<ABSTRACT>
Process for dyeing or printing cellulosic fibre materials with reactive dyes, characterised in that the fibre material is dyed or printed with at least one reactive dye containing a chlorotriazine radical and washed with an aqueous solution to which an amount of at least 0.01 gram per litre of alkaline earth metal salts has been added. The dyeings and prints obtained have good fastness properties.

<CLAIMS>
Process for dyeing or printing cellulosic fibre materials with 
reactive dyes, which comprises dyeing or printing the material with at 

least one reactive dye that contains a chlorotriazinyl radical, and 
washing the dyeing or print with an aqueous solution to which at least 

0.01 gram per litre of alkaline earth metal salt has been added. 
A process according to claim 1, which comprises the use of at least 
one of the reactive dyes of formulae (6) to (23) 


A process according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein the fibre 
material is printed. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, which comprises 
printing the fibre material, then washing the print in a first washing 

step with water that has no substantial content of alkaline earth metal 
salts, and in a second washing step with an aqueous solution to which at 

least 0.01 gram per litre of alkaline earth metal salt has been added. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein washing is 
carried out using an aqueous solution to which 0.01 to 1 gram per litre 

of alkaline earth metal salt has been added. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein washing is 
carried out using an aqueous solution to which 0.01 to 0.2 gram per 

litre of alkaline earth metal salt has been added.  
 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein washing is 
carried out using an aqueous solution to which 0.05 to 0.2 gram per 

litre of alkaline earth metal salt has been added. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the alkaline 
earth metal salt is a magnesium or calcium salt. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, which comprises 
using at least one of the reactive dyes o
f formulae (6) to (8).
