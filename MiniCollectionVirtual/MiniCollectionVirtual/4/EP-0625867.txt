<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a power supply device for an induction heating apparatus, especially for an induction heating apparatus having a normal mode of operation and a standby mode of operation, which are controlled by a control power supply unit. According to the invention, the charging capacitor (C1) of a first rectifier circuit (D1) for the power converter (2) assigned to the heating plate is connected, via a diode (D3), to the charging capacitor (C2) of a second rectifier circuit (D2) intended for a control power supply unit (5) for operation in standby mode. As soon as an overvoltage appears in the first, relatively small, charging capacitor (C1), the said diode (D3) couples it in parallel with the relatively larger charging capacitor (C2) of the second rectifier circuit (D2).
