<ABSTRACT>
Two half-shells (2), (3) of plastics material or the like fit 
together under pressure to form a container for tablets. One 

half-shell comprises a corner (8) turnable about an elastic 
flexibility line (9) to form the lid for the container opening; 

when closed, said corner engages with flanges (11) projecting from 
the complementary part (12) of the other half-shell, on which 

there are provided retaining rims (12) for the tablets (1) and 
lateral spacers (13) for limiting their discharge passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container for tablets or the like, 
consisting substantially of two half-shells of plastics material 
which fit together under pressure by means of male-female 
insertion elements. One corner of one half-shell can be turned about a linear section 
of elastic flexibility and comprises a profiled edge which, when 
closed by pressing, engages with flanges projecting from the 
peripheral edge of the corresponding complementary corner of the 
other half-shell. The peripheral edge of said corner comprises a projecting rim for 
retaining tablets, and spacers for limiting the discharge passage 
of said tablets. Of the many pocket containers currently used for sweets, sugar 
coated pills, tablets and/or pills in general, the object of the 
present invention is to solve the problem of constructional 
simplicity and economy, together with the necessary functionality 
and suitability for dispensing one at a time the products 
contained in the container. The invention, as characterised by the claims, solves the problem 
by means of a container for tablets or the like, by which the 
following results are obtained: the container consists of only two 
half-shells of plastics material or the like, which fit together 
by the mutual insertion of male-female elements under pressure; 
combined with and integral with the two half-shells there are also  
 
formed the lid for opening and closing the container together with 
the relative hinge and the fixed means to which said lid is 
secured by snap action on closure; in correspondence with its 
aperture, the container comprises a collection region for the 
discharged products, with a retention rim and spacer means for 
guiding and limiting the discharge of the products; the interior 
space of the container is sufficiently large to allow uniform 
dispensing, adjacently in plan, of a single layer of products such 
as tablets, pills, sugar-coated pills, sweets and the like. The advantages provided by the present invention consist 
essentially of the fact that the container is of simple and rapid 
construction, of very low production cost, and easy to use for the 
measured dispensing of its contents. In addition, the container is of very small dimensions and in 
particular thickness, and can be easily carried in the pocket 
and/or handbag. The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A container for tablets or the like, characterised by 
consisting of two half-shells (2) and (3) which fit together under 

pressure by the insertion-coupling and centering of complementary 
male (4) and female (5) elements and peripheral edges (7); said 

half-shells comprising, in correspondence with a complementary 
corner, an aperture (14) delimited by opposing lateral spacers 

(13) and a retention rim (12), on which there engages a lid (8) 
which is integral with one of the half-shells via a hinge (9) 

originating from the same elastically preformed material. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
consisting of two half-shells (2) and (3) complete with an 

aperture (14), spacers (13), a rim (12) and a lid (8), all formed 
of elastic plastics material. 
A container as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the lid (8), integral with one half-shell (3) and rotatable 

about a hinge (9) deriving from the elastic forming of a strip of 
material integral with the said half-shell and the said container, 

comprises bent lateral edges which, on closure, enter into elastic 
engagement relationship by snap action over lateral flanges (11) 

which project from the lateral edges (12) of that corner portion 
of the second half-shell (2) complementary to the lid. 
A container as claimed in claims 1, 2 and 3, characterised 
in that one half-shell (2) comprises a corner, complementary to 

the lid (8) of the other half-shell (3), in which there is 
provided a passage compartment (14) delimited by opposing lateral 

spacers (13) and facing a front region, enclosed by the rims (12), 
in which the products discharged by the container towards said 

compartment become positioned. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
comprising internal spacers (6). 
A container for tablets or the like as claimed in the 
preceding claims as described and illustrated and for the objects 

specified.
