<ABSTRACT>
A sound insulating membrane and processes for 
forming, particularly well suited for use in floor, 

ceiling and wall constructions. The membrane comprises 
at least one backing layer (10,30) in contact with a 

layer (20) of polymeric material. The polymeric material 
has an elongation factor of about 500% to about 900% and 

a Shore A hardness of from about 65 to about 80 points, 
5 seconds. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric 

material comprises 40-70% chlorinated polyethylene, 20-30% 
ethylene vinyl acetate, and up to 10% polyvinyl 

chloride. The membrane may be used between a floor 
structure (60) and ceramic tiles (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sound insulating
membranes for use in residential, business, and
industrial buildings. Membranes made in accordance with
the present invention are particularly well suited for
use in ceiling, floor and wall constructions employing
ceramic or masonry materials. See for example the Sound insulating sheet disclosed in US-A-4112175.Ceramic and masonry tile floor and wall coverings
have been used extensively in the construction of
buildings for many years. Such materials are employed
for their strength, durability, attractive appearance and
excellent thermal insulating properties. Despite their
many desirable features, ceramic and masonry materials
typically exhibit poor sound and acoustic insulating
properties.It is undesirable to utilize materials having poor
sound or acoustic insulating properties in buildings,
especially in modern multi-story urban buildings having
high population densities, such as apartment or office
buildings. Nearly all apartment dwellers, hotel guests
and office workers have at one time or another been
subjected to irritating, bothersome noise from an
adjacent room or an upper or lower level. In addition,
certain high security meeting rooms may even require that
sound not be transmitted beyond the confines of the room.Moreover, it is desirable to have a high degree of
sound insulation in the walls and panels of mobile homes,
campers, motor homes and other recreational vehicles. It
is also beneficial for mass transit vehicles such as
subways, trains and buses to have relatively quiet
interiors for passenger comfort. Moreover, it is
desirable to provide quiet environments in cabins of
airplanes and marine vessels.Ceiling, floor and wall assemblies are typically 
subjected to two types of noise -- airborne sound, for
example speech or music, and impact noise, for instance
from footsteps. Many building codes have been amended
and ordinances enacted in response to the demand for
reduced noise levels in buildings, to specifically
require that ceiling, floor and wall constructions
exhibit certain minimum sound and acoustic insulating
characteristics. For example, codes are currently in
effect in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Seattle, and
Minneapolis and typically require that ceiling, floor and
wall constructions achieve a Sound Transmission Class
(STC) rating of at least 50 (or 45 if field tested), as
determined by ASTM Standards E90, E336 and E413. This
rating provides a measure of the amount of airborne sound
transmitted between rooms or floors. In addition,

<CLAIMS>
A sound insulating membrane comprising: at least one
backing layer (10); and a polymeric layer (20) contacting said one

backing layer (10), said polymeric layer (20) formed from a blend
of at least one polymeric material, said polymeric layer (20)

having an elongation factor of from about 500% to about
900% and a Shore A hardness of from about 65 to about 80

points, 5 seconds, wherein said membrane has a thickness
of less than about 3.8mm (0.150"), preferably less than

about 2.55mm.
A membrane according to claim 1 wherein said backing
layer (10) is formed from a material selected from polyester,

polypropylene, polyamide, nylon and glass.
A membrane according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
said backing layer (10) has a thickness of from 0.1 to 0.51mm

(0.004" to 0.020") and preferably has a thickness of
.229mm.
A membrane according to any of claims 1 to 3 which
includes a second backing (30) layer substantially overlying

and contacting said polymeric layer (20).
A membrane according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein
said polymeric layer (20) has a thickness of from about .51 to

1.68mm (0.020" to 0.066'').
A membrane according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein
said polymeric layer (20) has an elongation factor of from

about 600% to about 800%.
A membrane according to any of claims 1 to 6 wherein
said polymeric layer (20) has a Shore A hardness of less than 

about 75 ± 2 points, 5 seconds.
A membrane according to any of claims 1 to 7 in
which the elastic polymeric layer (20) is flexible relative to

said backing layer and comprises from about 40% to about
70% chlorinated polyethylene, from about 20% to about 30%

ethylene vinyl acetate, and up to about 10% polyvinyl
chloride.
A floor, ceiling or wall construction comprising a
substrate and a sound insulating membrane, the membrane

being according to any of claims 1 to 8.
A construction according to claim 9 wherein the
substrate consists of wood, concrete, masonry materials,

metal or a composite thereof.
A construction according to claim 9 or claim 10
which is a floor construction and which includes a floor

covering, preferably of ceramic tiles, disposed above the
membrane.
A method of making a membrane according to any of
claims 1 to 8 characterised by heating said polymeric

material forming said polymeric layer (20) to a temperature of
at least about 93°C (200°F); contacting said at least one

backing layer (10,30) with said heated polymeric material; and
subjecting said polymeric material and said at least one

backing layer (10,30) to a pressure of at least about 3450 kPa
(500 psi), thereby forming said membrane.
