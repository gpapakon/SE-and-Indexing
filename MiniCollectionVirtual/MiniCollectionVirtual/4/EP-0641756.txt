<ABSTRACT>
1-pentene dimers of α -methylstyrenes are 
produced with high selectivity in good productivity by 

stirring 50 to 95 parts by weight of an α -methylstyrene in 
the presence of 50 to 5 parts by weight of an aqueous 

solution of a sulfonic acid, and a 1-pentene dimer having 
good preservative property is then collected by removing 

the sulfonic acid, adjusting the resulting reaction 
solution to pH 8 or higher and distilling the neutralized 

reaction solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
preparing unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrenes which are 
suitably used as agents for controlling molecular weight in 
the production of copolymers, such as SBR. In production of copolymers, such as ABS resins, 
AS resins, polystyrene and SBR, tetrachloromethane or 
dodecylmercaptans have been used as agents for controlling 
molecular weight. However, as to tetrachloromethane, which 
destroys the ozone layer, its abolition by the end of 1995 
was settled at the Montreal International Conference in 
1992, and the use of dodecylmercaptans has come to be 
restricted due to regulations concerning odor pollution caused during 
handling and uses. These agents therefore have come to be substituted by 
unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrenes, particularly by 1-pentene dimers, 
but there is not yet reported any industrial method for producing 1-pentene 
dimers in good selectivity.  
 In Japanese Patent Application Kokoku Koho 
(publication) No. 41-6335 is disclosed a conventional 
method of preparation of unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrenes 
wherein α-methylstyrenes are dimerized by 
using sulfonic acids as catalysts. The method however is 
poor in the selectivity toward 1-pentene dimers since the 
catalysts are in direct contact with the α-methylstyrenes. 
Further, since the resulting unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrenes 
decompose readily on distillation with heat 
under acidic conditions caused by the presence of the 
catalysts, the method needs complicated steps preceding to 
the distillation, for example, removal of the catalysts 
from reaction solutions by filtration, by neutralization 
with a large amount of an alkali or by rinsing with water 
or an aqueous alkali solution. Even the unsaturated dimers 
resulting from such complicated steps and distillation 
involve a problem. That is, the unsaturated dimers 
purified by the distillation are free of problems for a 
while, but are so poor in stability as to get 
colored during storage. An object of the present invention is to provide  
 
a method of preparing unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrenes 
whereby α-methylstyrenes are dimerized in 
high selectivity and good productivity into 1-pentene 
dimers which are among unsaturated dimers of α-methylstyrenes. The result of the inventors' study for achieving 
the object has proved that among various unsaturated dimers 
of α-methylstyrenes, 1-pentene dimers can be produced in 
good selectivity and high productivity by using as 
catalysts sulfonic acids in a
