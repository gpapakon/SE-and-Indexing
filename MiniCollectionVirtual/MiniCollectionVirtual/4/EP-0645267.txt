<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for air-conditioning a passenger compartment (26) of a motor vehicle including an air-conditioning circuit (1) and a mechanism (2) comprising first means (56, 60) for actuating a feed flap (40) between a first position in which the air to be conditioned provided to the conditioning circuit (1) comes from outside the vehicle, and a second, so-called recirculating, position in which the air coming from the said passenger compartment is reintroduced into the said circuit (1), and second means (56, 58) for actuating at least one flap (28) for splitting the conditioned air between a first position in which the conditioned air is transmitted mainly to the region (30) of the windscreen of the vehicle, and at least a second position in which the conditioned air is transmitted to other regions (32, 34) of the passenger compartment (26) of the vehicle, the said device being characterised in that the said first and second means (56, 58, 60) are coupled so that the said feed flap (40) is always in a position different from its second position when the said splitter flap (28) is in the first position.
