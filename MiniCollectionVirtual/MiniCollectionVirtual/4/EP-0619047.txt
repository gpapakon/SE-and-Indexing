<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTECTIVE COVER FOR ELECTRICAL BUS BARS AND METHOD OF USING SAMERelated Application Related co-pending U. S. Application Serial No. oi ≤Η.e filed on even date herewith and identified by Assignee's Docket No. DL-87 discloses one class of a protective cover apparatus which is suitable for use in the present application. The entire teaching and disclosure of that co-pending application is incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to panelboards, switchboards, electrical distribxition devices, and the like, which have an exposed electrical bus bar and, more particularly, to a cover which protects the exposed bus bar without interference with mounting of individual circuit interrupters.Background of the InventionPanelboards, switchboards, and other electrical distribution devices are commonly used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Individual circuit interrupters are mounted to these devices to protect branch circuits against overload and fault conditions. Basically, circuit interrupters like circuit breakers and fusible switches comprise a pair of separable contacts, a spring- operated mechanism for effecting separation of the contacts, and a tripping mechanism or fuse which automatically releases the operating mechanism upon the occurrence of an overload or fault condition.Panelboards and the like are often constructed with bus bars or projecting lugs to form disconnect contacts for the removable individual circuit interrupters. These bus bars and lugs are rigidly attached to the upper surface 

 of the panelboard support mo.' ding. Since the bus bars are exposed to the front of the 'janelboard, it is possible that an operator could be severely burned or shocked if they accidentally touched the terminals while installing the circuit breaker. Furthermore, the main circuit Interrupter could be short circuited if conducting material accidentally bridged across the respective bus bars. The bus bars may also be subject to damage during the installation of other components near the panelboard. In view of the increasing safety requirements for load centers and panelboards already in operation that do not contain a protective apparatus for exposed electrical bus bars, there is a need for a factory and field-installed protective cover that fits the bus bar designs of various manufacture.Summary of the InventionAccording to the present invention, a cover is provided for an exposed bus bar attached to an electrical distribution device having a contoured
