<ABSTRACT>
A wobble detecting apparatus for an information
recording and/or reproducing for an optical disk, includes

a wobble detecting unit for detecting a wobble on the basis
of a signal from a light receiving element which receives light

reflected from the optical disk; an offset voltage generating
unit for generating an offset voltage; an adder unit for adding

said offset voltage to a control signal to an actuator for the
optical disk; an actuator switch for on/off controlling a

control signal to said actuator; and a control unit for
turning on said actuator for wobble detection to decide whether

or not the wobble has been detected by said wobble detecting
unit, and if the wobble has not been detected, causing said

offset voltage generating unit to generate a positive or
negative prescribed voltage to decide further whether or not

the wobble has been detected by said wobble detecting unit.
In this configuration, the wobble can be detected with high

accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wobble detecting apparatus for detecting a wobble signal of an optical disk in a device for recording and/or reproducing information for the optical disk.In an optical disk such as a writable CD or DVD, as shown in Fig. 10, a track 1A of an optical disk 1 on which information is to be stored wobbles. The wobble is detected to reproduce a clock signal at the time of the write.In the device for recording and/or reproducing information for the optical disk, as the case may be, the presence or absence of the wobble is decided to determine whether the optical disk loaded in the device is recordable or dedicated to only reproduction.In the device for recording and/or reproducing information for an optical disk, laser light is focused, the focused light is projected on the optical disk, and the light reflected from the optical disk is received by a light receiving element, thereby providing a wobble signal, a tracking signal, a focus signal and a reproduction signal.Fig. 11 shows relative positions of a light receiving element and a received light spot 21 of the reflected light projected on the light receiving element 4.The light receiving element 4 is partitioned into four sections A, B, C and D. In shipping the device, as seen from Fig. 11B, adjustment is made so that the received light spot is projected on the center of the four divided sections. This adjustment cannot be made completely. As seen from Fig. 11A, the optical axis is misaligned leftward, or otherwise, as seen from Fig. 11C, the optical axis is misaligned rightward.The wobble signal is obtained from a difference signal (A + B) - (C + D) on the basis of the output signals from the sections A, B, C and D of the light receiving element 4.As seen from Figs. 11A and 11C, when the received light spot deviates from the boundary between the sections A, B and C, D owing to the misalignment of the optical axis, the S/N ratio of the wobble signal based on the difference signal (A + B) - (C + D) is deteriorated, and hence the presence or absence of the wobble signal cannot be detected precisely.US-A-5 764 610 describes an optical disk type identification system using a frequency detector comprising a wobble signal detecting unit sampling the wobble signal using the signal output by a light pickup. A system control circuit outputs a switching signal to a switch which selects one of the input signals produced by rotation control circuits before supplying it to the spindle motor rotating the disk.An object of this invention is to
