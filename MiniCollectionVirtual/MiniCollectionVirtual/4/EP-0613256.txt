<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for analogue to
digital conversion comprising a means for receiving an input
analogue signal, a dither means for adding a dither signal
and an analogue to digital converter for converting the
combined input signal and dither signal to a digital value.Application of a dither or QED (Quantisation Error Dispersion)
signal to an analogue signal prior to conversion to a digital
value is a well-known signal processing technique for
overcoming the limitations of the resolution of a particular
analogue to digital converter. The limit of resolution of a
converter is generally fixed by the spacing between levels of
the converter. For example, for a typical analogue to digital
converter, an analogue signal falling between two adjacent
levels or steps of the converter will always be converted to
the lower digital value. Thus a quantisation error is
introduced as different analogue values falling within this
interval will all give rise to the same digital value.
Improving the resolution of the converter by increasing the
number of levels reduces this error but is a complicated and
costly way of doing this. Furthermore, for some applications,
digital conversion of signals of quite different magnitudes
may be necessary and, for low magnitude signals, variations
of interest in the signal may still lie between two levels of
the converter.Addition of a dither signal, such as a ramp signal or a white
noise signal, to the input signal prior to digital conversion
provides one way of compensating for these quantisation
errors. Consider, for example, the case of an analogue signal
being of a value of exactly half a quantisation level. If no
dither signal is applied, the converter will output the lower
digital value at all times. However, if a rising ramp signal of 
a magnitude equal to one quantisation interval is added to
the input signal prior to conversion, the magnitude of the
combined signal will remain below the next threshold for
half the time, of the ramp but will rise above the next
threshold for the other half of the time such that the
converter will output the lower quantisation level for half
the time and the upper level for the other half of the time.
Averaging the output of the converter over the ramp time
will thus give a value corresponding to the average of the
two quantisation levels, i.e. the actual value of the input
analogue signal.Such signal processing techniques have been widely
developed in a number of different applications, such as
image processing,
