<ABSTRACT>
The coaxial filter cigarette (100) according to the invention consists of a coaxial strand part (101) and a coaxial filter element (111). The strand part has an inner core (102) of a material which smoulders largely without residue, especially tobacco material, which is surrounded by a wrapper (103) which, in turn, is surrounded by an outer shell (104) of a tobacco and/or non-tobacco material. A wrapper (105) of an air-permeable material wraps the outer shell. The coaxial filter element (111) possesses a filter core (112) with an air-impermeable wrapper (113). The filter core or its wrapper coaxially surrounds a filter shell (114) whose diameter corresponds to the diameter of the outer shell. An air-impermeable wrapper (115), which also serves to connect the strand part and the filter element, surrounds the filter shell. A ventilation zone (116) is incorporated into the air-impermeable wrapper for the filter shell. A smoke mixing zone (120) for changing, in a defined manner, the smoke mixture leaving the strand part before it flows into the filter element is designed in the transition region between the strand part and the filter element.

A coaxial filter cigarette comprising 

A) a coaxial rod portion (101, 201, 401, 501) 

a) having an inner core (102, 202, 402, 502) of a material smouldering 
substantially residue-free, in particular tobacco material, 
b) having a wrapper (103, 203, 403, 503) for the inner core (102, 202, 
402, 502), 
c) having an outer jacket (104, 204, 404, 504) consisting of a tobacco 
and/or non-tobacco material and coaxially surrounding the inner core 

(102, 202, 402, 502) and its wrapper (103, 203, 403, 503), 
d) and having an air-permeable wrapper (105, 205, 405, 505) for the 
outer jacket (104, 204, 404, 504) and 
B) comprising a coaxial filter element (111, 211, 411, 511) 

a) having a filter core (112, 212, 412, 512) having an air-impermeable 
wrapper (113, 213, 413, 513), 
b) having a filter jacket (114, 214, 414, 514) coaxially surrounding the 
filter core (112, 212, 412, 512) and its wrapper (113, 213, 413, 513) 

and having a diameter corresponding to the diameter of the outer 
jacket, 
c) having an air-impermeable wrapper (115, 215, 415, 515) for the filter 
jacket (114, 214, 414, 514) serving also to connect the rod portion 

(101, 201, 401, 501) and the filter element (111, 211, 411, 511), and 
d) having a ventilation zone (116, 216, 416, 516) in the air-impermeable 
wrapper (115, 215, 415, 515) for the filter jacket (114, 214, 414, 

514), 
characterized by
 the following features:  
 
C) in the transition region between the rod portion (101, 201, 401, 501) and the 
filter element (111, 211, 411, 511) a smoke mixing zone (120, 220, 420, 

520) is formed for defined variation of the smoke streams leaving rod portion 
(101, 201, 401, 501) before they flow into the filter element (111, 211, 411, 

511). 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
smoke mixing zone (120, 420) is formed i
n that the rod portion (101, 401) 
is arranged with its filter-side end spaced from the tobacco-side end of the 

coaxial filter element (111, 411), a cavity (120, 420) thereby being formed 
which is surrounded by the air-impermeable wrapper (115, 415) of the filter 

jacket (114, 414). 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
smoke mixing zone (220) is formed in that the wrapper (203) of the inner 

core (202) of the rod portion (201) is provided with a perforation zone in the 
region of its filter-side end. 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
empty volume proportion of the rod portion (101, 201, 401, 501) lies in the 

range between about 40% and about 80%. 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
empty volume proportion of the filter element (111, 211, 411, 511) is at least 

80%, preferably more than 90%. 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the rod portion (401) arranged with its filter-side end spaced from the 

tobacco-side end of the filter element (411) is displaceable within predefined 
markings on the wrapper (405) of the outer jacket (404) in the axial direction 

in a projecting edge region of the wrapper (415) of the filter element (411).  
 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the wrapper (505) of the outer jacket (504) of the rod portion (501) 

comprises in the region of the filter beginning a perforation zone (506) which 
is at least partially coverable by a ring (507) displaceable on the outer surface 

of the coaxial filter cigarette and having corresponding perforations (508), so 
that by varying the ventilation the smoke streams can be influenced and thus 

an admixing of the smoke stream to another takes place. 
A coaxial filter cigarette according to claim 7, characterized in that the ring 
(507) is arranged displaceably or rotatably on the outer periphery of the 

coaxial filter cigarette.
