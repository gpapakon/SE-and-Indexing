<ABSTRACT>
A measurement is carried out of the magnetic field (B+I1+R1) along the axis of the earth's magnetic field using a scalar magnetometer, then a vector measurement of the resultant magnetic field (Bp+Ip+R3), projected onto an invariant measurement axis is carried out. With the aid of the calculated values of the earth's magnetic field (B) and of the susceptibility magnetic field (I), it is, in particular, possible to calculate a component (S) of the remanent magnetic field (R) perpendicularly to the earth's magnetic field (B) and to determine whether the cancellation of the component of the field (R1) along this axis is due to tilting of the magnetic pole during history or a local weakening of the remanent magnetisation. Application to dating geological formations in boreholes.
