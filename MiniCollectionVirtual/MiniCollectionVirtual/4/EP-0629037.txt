The method and the device for regulating power supply are applied to an asynchronous electric motor which is multi-phase or single-phase with a main phase and an auxiliary phase with a capacitor, coupled to a pump. It includes a comparison unit 8 able to compare the measured value 10 of the cos  phi  of the main phase 16 and, when the value of cos  phi is less than a threshold value 21, to trigger a slaving signal 22 to a circuit 23 for slaving the power supply voltage UM of the motor M' to the measured value of cos  phi . Application to single-phase motors regulated up to off-load speed.
