<ABSTRACT>
An image recognition apparatus recognizes an input 
locus as a command, a figure and a character, 

respectively in gesture recognition mode, figure 
recognition mode and character recognition mode. 

Regarding each recognized result, similarity between the 
input image and the recognized shape is obtained. The 

similarities are compared with each other, and if the 
difference between the similarities is less than a 

predetermined value, the recognized results are 
displayed for selection by an operator. Then, selected 

one of the displayed shapes is determined as the final 
recognition result. This enables correct locus input 

even if there is a possibility that the locus is 
recognized, in different recognition modes, as similar 

shapes of different functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data input
apparatus for inputting operation commands, character
data and other type of data, using an input pen and a
digitizer, and a data input method for the apparatus.Conventional pen-input electronic devices usually
have gesture-command input function that allows a user
to pen-input operation commands in an input mode, in
which a number of points or loci are traced, or locus-input
mode in which a single point or locus is indicated.
The first of these two modes will hereinafter be referred
to as a trace mode.In gesture-command input, if a predetermined input
is recognized, the command corresponding to the input
operates. To discriminate between the two modes, or to
avoid confusion of gesture-command recognition with
character and figure recognition, several limitations are
introduced as follows.For example, an input trace hard to distinguish from
a similar character cannot be used as a gesture command,
otherwise, a character similar to an input locus used as
a gesture command cannot be recognized. Also, in figure-input
mode, shapes often used as figures such as O, X,
and Δ cannot be used as gesture commands. Further, there
is a case where the 
user needs to designate command-input mode or non-command-input
mode.As described above, these limitations are made
basically to prevent confusion of gesture-command input
with other types of input in the same input mode.However, in the case where the user designates the
input mode, the user may need to change input modes so
often that the input operation is not smooth, meaning,
the manual mode-change operation will be troublesome.As mentioned above, if the pen-input device does
not have command-input mode, the input loci used as
gesture commands, otherwise shapes recognizable as
characters or figures are limited. For this reason, the
user cannot use, e.g., shapes which are intuitively
recognizable by the user, as gesture commands. Further,
as input characters are limited, some characters cannot
be easily inputted. Furthermore, it is confusing for
the user when a command is inputted with different
gestures in respective figure-input mode and character-input
mode.For example, a gesture command "X" (delete) is
effective when character-input is not made, however, in
character-input mode, the input "X" is treated as an
alphabetic character. When a gesture command "γ" (undo) exists, a
Greek letter "γ" cannot be inputted. In this manner, the conventional input systems have
different gestures in different input modes regarding one

<CLAIMS>
An image recognition apparatus for recognizing
data input in the form of a locus or a series of linked

loci, comprising:

input means (1) for inputting the data;
recognition means (3; 4; 5) for recognizing an image
represented by the data input by said input means as

shapes having different functions, such as gesture and
character in a plurality of recognition modes so as to

obtain first candidates for a recognition result in each
of the plurality of recognition modes;
judgment means for judging whether or not the first
candidates so obtained have shapes which are similar to

each other; and
selection means (7, 8) for selecting in accordance
with a designation by a user one from the first

candidates as the recognition result when the first
candidates have similar shapes to each other as

determined by the judgment means.
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising 
display means (7, 903) for displaying shapes

corresponding to the first candidates which are judged as
having similar shapes to each other by said judgment

means,

   wherein said selection means is adapted to select
one of the displayed shapes corresponding to the first

candidates in accordance with a designation by a user.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
