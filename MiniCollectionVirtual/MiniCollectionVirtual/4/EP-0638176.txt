<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring rotary movements, in particular for mounting in a wheel bearing, essentially has a measurement value sensor (1, 10, 10', 22) arranged in the axis of rotation of the rotating part (26, 26') and a signal generating ring (2, 19, 23, 28) belonging to a hollow cylindrical or pot-shaped signal generating component (3, 21). The signal generating ring (2, 19, 23, 28) is rotatively mounted on a cylindrical part of the measurement value sensor (1, 10, 10', 22).

A device for measuring rotation and for generating an 
electric alternating signal representative of rotation, which 

device is adapted to be mounted into the axis of rotation of 
the part (26, 26') performing the rotation, including a 

stationary transducer (1, 10, 10', 22) having a measurement 
system (15, 24) positioned in a housing (17, 17'), and a 

signal generator ring (2, 19, 23, 28) which is part of a 
hollow-cylindrical or bowl-shaped component part (3, 21) and 

is adapted to be coupled with the part (26, 26') performing 
the rotation,
characterized
 in that the transducer (1, 10, 
10', 22) in the case of application is arranged and can be 

locked in the axis of rotation of the part (26, 26') 
performing the rotation and has an at least partly 

cylindrical housing portion (4) in which the measurement 
system (15, 24) is incorporated, and in that the signal 

generator ring (2, 19, 23, 28) is rotatably supported on the 
peripheral surface of the housing part (4) of the transducer 

(1, 10, 10', 22). 
A device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the measurement system 
(15, 24) includes a measuring coil (15) which is mounted in 

the housing of the transducer (1, 10, 10', 22) 
perpendicularly relative to the axis of rotation of the part 

(26, 26') performing the rotation, the measuring coil having 
a permanent magnet and one or more pole shoes which are 

arranged perpendicularly to the axis of rotation or, 
respectively, the axis of the housing (17, 17'), and the end  

 
pieces of the pole shoes project from the coil (15) and 

extend generally to the inner surface of the signal generator 
ring (2, 19, 23, 28). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that a double-sided 

measurement system includes a measuring coil (15) arranged 
perpendicularly or at right angles to the axis of the housing 

and having a permanent magnetic core, magnetized 
perpendicularly to the measuring coil axis, and pole shoes 

that are arranged on the pole surfaces of the permanent 
magnet in parallel to the measuring coil axis, the end pieces 

of which pole shoes project on either side of the coil (15) 
and extend generally to the inner surface of the signal 

generator ring (2, 19, 23, 28). 
A device as claimed in any one or more of the claims 1 to 3, 

characterized
 in that the signal generator ring 
(2, 19, 23, 28) includes a hollow cylinder portion having an 

internal toothing (20). 
A device as claimed in claims 3 and 4,
characterized
 in that the internal toothing 
(20) and the pole shoes are designed and arranged such that, 

when one end piece of a pole shoe is opposite to a tooth, the 
diametral end piece of the second pole shoe is simultaneously 

opposite to a tooth, while the other two end pieces of the 
pole shoes are simultaneously opposite tooth gaps. 
A device as claimed in any one or more of the claims 1 to 5, 

characterized
 in that the peripheral surface of  
 

the housing part (4) and/or the surface of the signal 
generator ring (2, 19, 23, 28) abutting on the housing (17, 

17') is coated with a sliding layer. 
A device as claimed in any one or more of the claims 1 to 6, 

characterized
 in that the transducer (1, 10, 
10', 22) is provided in the shape of an element which can be 

slipped, positioned and locked in a predetermined position in 
a mounting support (11, 22), the mounting support being 

adapted to be secured to the stationary part (8) of a wheel 
bearing. 
A device as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the transducer (1, 10, 
10', 22) together with the previously mounted signal 

generator component part (3, 21, 23) can be slipped into the 
mounting support (22), and the coupling between the signal 

generator ring (2, 19, 23, 28) and the part (26, 26') 
performing the rotation can be effected by means of a 

follower (7, 32), which is adapted to be secured to the 
signal generator component part (3, 21, 23) and/or to the 

part (26, 26') of the wheel bearing (9, 9') performing the 
rotation. 
A device as claimed in any one or a plurality of claims 1 to 
8,
characterized
 in that the hollow-cylindrical or 
bowl-shaped component part (3, 21) is coupled to the part 

performing the rotation by means of a follower (7, 32) or by 
a snug fit.
