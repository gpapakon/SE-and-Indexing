<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a process which enables cubic texturing in Fe-Si magnetic steel sheets having a thickness 
>
 0.1 mm at temperatures up to 1200@C in an economically beneficial time and in which grain sizes of from approximately 1 to 5 mm are produced. The process is characterised in that   a) first an iron melt (liquid iron) or semifinished iron product containing the usual impurities is decarburised down to 
<
 20 ppm by weight of carbon, b) then the block obtained from the melt, or the annealed semifinished iron product, during or after alloying, if required, with silicon to reduce the oxygen content to values 
<
 10 ppm by weight, is remelted in a vacuum better than 1.33 Pa, and c) finally the iron-silicon material thus produced is processed further, while avoiding the incorporation of impurities, especially avoiding an increase in the carbon and oxygen content set in the material, to give magnetic sheet steel, employing a final annealing process, to be carried out in dry hydrogen at from 950 to 1200@C, for texturing.   The process can be used to produce transformer magnetic sheet steel (transformer laminations, core plate) and dynamo sheet (electrical sheet steel).
