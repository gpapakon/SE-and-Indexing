<ABSTRACT>
Heat-sealable containers or pouches of plastic film, which are heat-sterilizable at temperatures between about 120  DEG C and 130 DEG C and which reform their heat seals at such temperatures in order to retain the flexibility and resistance of the heat seals to rupture or leak under impact and/or compression forces. The novel pouches or containers are produced by superposing films of isotactic random reactant polymers of polypropylene containing from about 5% to about 20% by weight of ethylene, and heat sealing the films to each other to form containers or pouches on which the heat-seals remelt and reform during heat-sterilization at a temperature within the range of from about 120  DEG C to about 130  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heat-sealed 
containers of thermoplastic films and, more 
particularly, to such containers which are 
heat-sterilizable at temperatures between 
120° to 130°C, clear or transparent and resistant 
to rupture if dropped onto a hard surface at 
ordinary ambient conditions. Such containers are 
commonly used in the food and medical industries. It is known to produce sterilizable and retortable 
heat-sealed containers or pouches from 
thermoplastic films and laminates of such films, 
some such containers being clear or transparent. A retort container or pouch must posses the 
following properties, all of which are provided or 
affected by the inner seal layers: 
1. they must be heat sealable for closing the 
container securely following filling;  
 2. they must be flexible and yet have sufficient 
toughness and impact strength to enable the pouch 
to withstand severe abuse testing in accordance 
with industry shipping standards. 3. they must be capable of withstanding 
sterilization at temperatures in the range of 121°C 
to 135°C to kill botulism; 4. they must posses non-blocking properties in 
that the interior opposed faces of the container 
must not stick together which would impede filling 
of the pouch; 5. the film used in the pouches must be 
processable without sticking as it is unrolled from 
the film roll during manufacture of the pouches and 
subsequent sterilization; 6. they must have sufficient capacity to be 
economical. (Institutions serving large numbers of 
people are not likely to use extensively containers 
having capacities less than one liter). Most commonly such containers or pouches are 
produced from thermoplastic films having melting 
points above about 135°C, so as to require 
sterilization or retort temperatures of 135°C or 
higher. Unless the containers or pouches are 
heated to the softening temperature of the 
heat-sealed films, the heat seal does not soften 
and reform but rather becomes brittle when the 
container is cooled, whereby the container is  
 
susceptible to rupture if dropped at ambient 
conditions. At retort temperatures the fluids 
within the heat sealed container are generally 
steam autoclaved at a temperature of about 121°C, 
and the heat-sealed film must have a low water loss 
at such temperature during autoclaving and storage. The use of higher autoclave temperatures above 
about 130°C and up to about 160°C, as required to 
soften prior-known heat-sealed containers, subjects 
the containers to more excessive autoclave 
condition

Process for producing heat-sealable 
containers or pouches of plastic film, which are 

heat-sterilizable at temperatures between 
120°C and 130°C and which reform their heat seals 

at such temperatures in order to retain the 
flexibility and resistance of said heat seals to 

rupture or leak under impact and/or compression 
forces, comprising forming said pouches or 

containers by superposing films of isotactic random 
reactant polymers of polypropylene containing from 

5% to 20% by weight of ethylene, heat 
sealing said films to each other to form containers 

or pouches on which the heat-seals remelt and 
reform during heat-sterilization of the container 

or pouch at a temperature within the range of from 
120°C to 130°C. 
Process according to claim 1 in which 
said films of isotactic random reactant polymers 

are monofilms. 
Process according to claim 1 in which 
said films of isotactic random reactant polymers 

comprise the surface films of multi-film laminates, 
which surface films are heat-sealed to each other. 
Process according to claim 1 in which 
said films of isotactic random reactant polymers 

have a thickness between 6 and 10 mils (152-254 µm).  
 
Process according to claim 1 in which 
said films of isotactic random reactant polymers 

contain from 5.5% to 10% by weight of 
polyethylene. 
Process according to claim 1 in which 
said films of isotactic random reactant polymers

temperature of 125°C or less. 
A heat-sealable container or pouch of 
plastic film, which is heat-sterilizable at 

temperatures between 120°C and 130°C and

of said heat seals to rupture or leak under impact 

and/or compression forces, comprising superposed 
films of isotactic random reactant polymers of 

polypropylene containing from 5% to

heat-sealed to each other to form a container or 

pouch, the heat seals between said films being 
remeltable and reformable during sterilization 

within the range of from 120°C to 130°C to 
render the container or pouch resistant to rupture 

or leakage under impact and/or compressive forces.

in which said films of isotactic random reactant 

polymer are monofilms. 
A container or pouch according to claim 7
