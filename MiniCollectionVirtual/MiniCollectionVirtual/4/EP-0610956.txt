<ABSTRACT>
A container inner surface tester detects a major-defective 
container as well as foreign substances, 

dust, scratches, etc. on the surface of an axis-symmetrical 
container to be carried on a conveyor by 

irradiating the inner surface of the container using a 
illuminator concentric with the container, capturing 

the irradiated surface of the container in the axis 
direction, and analyzing the captured concentric 

image. The tester comprises, in addition to a minor-defect-detecting 
binarization circuit 24 for 

determining whether or not the test container has a 
minor defect, a major-defect-detecting binarization 

circuit 25 in which an image signal 23a is binarized 
with a binarization threshold for use in detecting 

picture elements indicating a major defect having the 
intensity larger than a normal black, white, or 

intensity difference level, and the number of picture 
elements indicating major defects for each window area 

is compared with an area threshold for use in 
determining a major defect so as to determine whether 

or not the container to be tested has a major defect 
and immediately stop the production line of containers  

 
when a major defect detection signal HDF is outputted. 

The tester can detect defects likewise on polygonal 
containers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container 
inner surface tester for detecting foreign substances, 
dust, scratches, etc. on the surface of a cylindrical 
container to be carried on a conveyor by checking the 
surface through image processing, and more 
specifically to a cylindrical container inner surface 
tester for detecting a defective container by 
irradiating the inner surface of the cylindrical 
container using a ring-shaped illuminator concentric 
with the axis-symmetrical cylindrical container, 
capturing the irradiated surface of the container in 
the axis direction, and analyzing the captured 
concentric image. Figures 1A and 1B show the conventional method of 
viewing the inner surface of a cylindrical container 
having metallic luster on its inner surface. Figure 
1A shows multi-value continuous tone image data 1' 
(hereinafter simply referred to as image data 1') 
stored in an image memory after capturing a 
cylindrical container 1 showing on Figure 1B from  
 
above in the axis direction through a TV camera. 
Figure 1B is a sectional view of the cylindrical 
container 1 and a ring-shaped illuminator 2 for 
irradiating the cylindrical container from above. In 
Figure 1B, the illuminator 2 and the cylindrical 
container 1 (hereinafter referred to simply as the 
container 1) are concentric to each other. As shown in Figure 1B, if the illuminator 2 
evenly irradiates the inner surface of the container 1 
and the TV camera captures the container 1 from above, 
then irradiation lights reflect on the inner surface 
having metallic luster and form image data 1' 
indicating concentric illumination variations 
(hereinafter referred to as an illumination pattern) 
as shown in Figure 1A. Figure 1A shows an opening 
highlighted portion 3 and a bottom highlighted portion 
4 formed by the direct reflection of the above 
described irradiation lights on the opening and bottom 
portion of the container 1. Figure 2A shows a scanning line Q-Q1 running 
through the center of the image data 1' of the 
container 1 shown in Figure 1A. Figure 2B is the 
graph indicating changes in reflection illumination, 
that is, image intensity, along the scanning line Q-Q1 
inside the container. The graph can also be obtained  
 
if the line Q-Q1 is rotated with the center of the 
container set as the center of the rotation. The 
illumination pattern, that is, generation of 
highlighted portions and non-highlighted portions, 
depends on a container to be checked, or on the 
direction of an irradiation light and of a viewing
