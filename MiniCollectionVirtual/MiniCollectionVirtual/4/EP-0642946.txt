<ABSTRACT>
The slide comprising a stationary element (11) and a moving element (12) which are able to slide relatively in a translational direction, a lock (20) with a catch (21) associated with the stationary element (11) and with a latch (22) associated with the moving element (12) and interacting with the catch (21) in order to lock onto or unlock from the latter at will so as to immobilise or respectively release the moving element (12) relative to the stationary element (11), an operating member (30) mounted on the moving element (12) and associated with the latch (22) by a coupling (300) so that at will it can, in particular, unlock the latch (22) normally locked onto the catch (21) is characterised in that the stationary element (11) includes a longitudinal internal reinforcing member (50) which locally forms the catch (21). Application to front seats, for example with fully mounted seat belt.

<CLAIMS>
A sliding rail, in particular for a motor 
vehicle seat, of the type comprising a fixed element (11) 

and a movable element (12) designed to slide relatively 
in a direction (100) of translation, a lock (20) having 

a keeper (21) associated with the fixed element (12) and 
having a bolt (22) associated with the movable element 

(12) and cooperating with the keeper (21) so as to be 
locked or unlocked on the latter, as required, in order 

to immobilise or free respectively the movable element 
(12) relative to the fixed element (11), an operating 

device (30) mounted on the movable element (12) and 
associated with the bolt (22) by a coupling system (300) 

so as to be able to unlock, as required, the bolt (22) 
normally locked on the keeper (21), the fixed element 

(11) being connected to a base or flooring by fixing 
means (102) and comprising a longitudinal internal 

element (50) which locally forms the keeper (21), 
characterized in that the internal element is a 

reinforcing piece (50) anchored to the base or flooring 
by the interposition of the fixing means (102). 
A sliding rail according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the fixed element (11) has a cross-section 

in the form of a C having formed in it an open 
longitudinal slot (101) parallel to a direction of 

translation (100) and in that the reinforcing piece (50) 
has an L-shaped cross-section, one flange (52) of which 

is positioned at least locally against the inner side of 
the C opposite to the slot (101) and the other flange 

(51) of which rests on one side of the C close to the 
slot (101). 
A sliding rail according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the flange (52) of the reinforcing 

piece (50) positioned at least locally against the side 
of the C opposite to the slot (101) has a free section  

 
(520) and in that this section (520) is formed so as to 

serve as a keeper (21). 
A sliding rail according to any one of Claims 
2 and 3, characterized in that the flange (51) of the 

reinforcing piece and the side of the C close to the slot 
(101) against which it rests, receive the fixing means 

(102). 
A sliding rail according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the side of the C close to the slot 

(101) of the fixed element (11) is perforated by at least 
one bore (111) and in that the flange (51) of the 

reinforcing piece (50) which rests against it is 
perforated by at least one seating (521), said bore (111) 

and seating (521) being positioned opposite one another 
in order to receive the fixing means (102). 
A sliding rail according to any one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the keeper (21) of the lock 

(20) is made with notches uniformly distributed on the 
reinforcing piece (50), in that the bolt (22) is a lever 

mounted movable in its plane parallel to the side of the 

C opposite to the slot (101) of the fixed element (11) 
and provided with at least one tooth, and in that the 

operating device (30) comprises a shaft (311) which is 
designed to rotate on itself and which passes freely 

through the slot (101) and has at one its free ends the 
coupling system (300) which associates it with the bolt 

(22) and which comprises complementary non-circular male 
and female forms (301, 302) engaging so as to be able to 

cause pivoting of the lever in order to separate, as 
required, the tooth from the notches in order to unlock 

the bolt (22) normally locked on the keeper (21). 
A sliding rail according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the operating device (30) is 

mounted on a support (40) integral with the movable 
element (12). 
A sliding rail according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the support (40) comprises a guide  

 
bearing in which the shaft (311) of the operating device 

(30) is mounted. 
A sliding rail according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the guide bearing has formed in it 

a chamber (400) and in that this chamber (400) contains 
a spring (312) for keeping the bolt (22) normally coupled 

with the operating device (30). 
A sliding rail according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the shaft (311) is designed to 

slide on itself so as to be able to disengage by means of 
translation from the coupling system (300) which 

associates it with the bolt (22), in that the bolt (22) 
has a locking boss intended to cooperate with the 

operating device (30) or its support (40) so as to serve 
as a stop memorising the adjustment position so that when 

the shaft (311) is rotated the bolt (22) normally locked 
on the keeper (21) pivots so as to be unlocked from the 

keeper (21) while remaining integral, during translation, 
with the movable element (12) by means of interposition 

of the engaged coupling system (300) and so that, when 
the shaft (311) is slid against the axial forces of the 

spring (312), the bolt (22) remains immobile normally 
locked in position in the keeper (21) while being 

separated from the movable element (12) when the coupling 
system (300) is disengaged. 
A sliding rail according to any one of Claims 
1 to 10, characterized in that the fixed element (11) and 

the movable element (12) of the sliding rail are 
aluminium-based and the reinforcing piece (50) is iron-based.
