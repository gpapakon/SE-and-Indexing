<ABSTRACT>
A photocurable polymer precursor added to a 
liquid crystal material polymerizes to form a mixture that 

significantly lowers the threshold and saturation voltages 
of a standard twisted nematic cell. The performance 

characteristics of the resulting display device resembles 
those of a device with a very high pretilt, thereby 

providing an economical method of fabricating liquid 
crystal cells of a type that require a high pretilt 

alignment. The presence of the polymer substantially 
reduces adverse ion-related effects such as optical droop 

and charge retention in the liquid crystal display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid crystal
cells and methods of fabricating them and, in particular,
to a method of fabricating a liquid crystal whose electro-optic
threshold is lower than the characteristic electro-optic
threshold of the liquid crystal material contained
within the cell.Reducing the electro-optic threshold of a liquid
crystal device facilitates a reduction in the drive
voltage required to switch the cell between optical
states. For example, the electro-optic threshold of a
standard twisted nematic device is about 2.0 volts. This
threshold voltage is characteristic of the liquid crystal
material contained in the cell.In the past, two approaches have been taken to
reduce the drive voltages of standard twisted nematic
cells. One approach entails the use of high dielectric
constant liquid crystal material with low elastic
constants, and the other entails the use of a high pretilt
alignment. Fig. 1 shows the electro-optic threshold
curves for six standard twisted nematic cells fabricated
with combinations of liquid crystal material and alignment
techniques. (The liquid crystal materials identified are
manufactured by Merck.) As an example, curves 1 and 2 
represent cells filled with the same liquid crystal
material, curve 1 indicating the performance with a high
pretilt silicon monoxide (SiO) alignment and curve 2
indicating the performance with a low pretilt polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) alignment. The higher pretilt results in
about a 0.6 volt lower electro-optic threshold.Neither of these approaches is desirable for the
following reasons. The high dielectric constant material
introduces higher ion solubility that manifests itself as
an image sticking effect in active matrix addressed
displays. The higher pretilt alignment is achieved by
evaporated alignment, which is neither an easy nor an
economical process.What is needed, therefore, is a liquid crystal cell
that can operate in an image display system as a switch
that changes optical states in response to relatively low
applied drive voltages.WO 92/19695 describes a method of manufacturing a
liquid crystal cell in which a polymer is added to liquid
crystal material. The mixture is subjected to UV
radiation in the presence of an electric field to align
the liquid crystal molecules orthogonally to the cell
walls so as to result in a material with negligible
variation of refractive index throughout and which is
haze-free at all viewing angles.It is desirable, therefore, to provide a liquid
crystal cell that has a relatively low
