<ABSTRACT>
A pack 300 has two retention tabs (D5) (D6) formed of the 
inner side wall panels of the lid (500). The retention tabs 

extend from the bottom edge of the lid. When the tabs are folded 
into the operational position, they function to help keep the lid 

closed by providing additional interference between the lid and 
the innerframe (200). 
The retention tabs can be folded into the operational 
position by the manufacturer. Alternatively the pack can be 

provided to the consumer with the tabs in the non-operational 
position leaving to the individual consumer's discretion the 

decision to fold them into the operational position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hinged-lid cigarette packs, and
more particularly to hinged-lid cigarette boxes having reduced
vertical edges.Hinged-lid cigarette boxes are well known. One of the
most popular forms of such boxes has an outer member which
includes a lower main portion, in which the cigarettes stand
vertically, and a lid. The lid is often (although not always)
hinged to the back of the main portion so that the upper ends of
the cigarettes are exposed when the lid is hinged back.
Although such boxes are usually formed with right-angled vertical
edges, the vertical edges may be rounded or radiused.Such boxes typically have an innerframe inside the main
portion which extends up from the main portion into the space
covered by the lid in the closed position. One important
function of the innerframe is to provide some interference with
the lid as it opens and closes. This interference helps to keep
the lid firmly and neatly closed and reduces the risk that the lid
will open accidentally. However, for the most part, the
innerframe provides such interference only once the lid has opened
beyond a certain point. The innerframe does not always provide
interference initially. Hence the lid may not always remain
completely closed with the bottom edges of the lid resting
directly on the top edges of the lower main portion of the box. It
is desirable for the lid to remain completely closed for the sake
of appearance and neatness (e.g. so that any loose tobacco remains
within the box) without damaging the contents of the box.The provision of retention means which retain the lid in
a completely closed position has previously been accomplished
through the use of means such as a tab member extending 
substantially perpendicular to the plane of a wall of the
innerframe, thereby interfering with the lid member. Such a tab
member is generally formed from the standard innerframe blank such
that when the tab is extended perpendicular to a wall, a cutout
area remains where the tab originally had been. Furthermore
such retention means are generally formed at the front right-angled
vertical edges of the innerframe. In the case of a box
with rounded or radiused vertical edges, the vertical edges are
rounded or radiused by multiple scoring of the blank and the
additional formation of such retention means may be difficult or
impossible.EP-A-0 507 112 discloses a rounded corner pack with an
inner frame. The edges of the inner frame may be provided with
protrusions which engage with the flared out hinged lid.It would be
