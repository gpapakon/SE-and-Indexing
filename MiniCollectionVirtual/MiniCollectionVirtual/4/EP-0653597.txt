<ABSTRACT>
A compressor (2) for refrigerators or freezers, preferably 
for household use, provided with a tray (1) supported 

above the compressor cap, the inside (3) of the tray having a 
nonlowered edge (4) so as to permit assembly of the cap with 

a horizontal movement, and with at least two pipes (5, 7) issuing 
from the compressor and disposed in virtually radial 

positions with respect to the compressor, wherein the tray is 
provided with at least one pair of elastic hooked lengthening 

pieces (8, 10) adapted to engage against the respective pipes 
(5, 7) and at least one of the lengthening pieces (8) is provided 

with an end portion (9) bent into a curl. 
Furthermore at least one of the lengthening pieces (10) 
is made of heat-resistant material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an airtight compressor 
provided with an evaporation tray for condensation water, 
utilized particularly in household refrigerators and freezers. This type of compressor is currently provided with a 
tray mounted above its upwardly open cap and utilized for 
collecting the amount of water obtained from the thawing of 
the frost or ice within the refrigerator in which the compressor 
is installed. Since this water must be eliminated without resorting to 
periodic emptying and cleaning of the cell, it has been found 
that an efficient, safe and automatic solution consists in 
collecting the water collected within the refrigerator and 
carrying it outside by means of expedient pipes, and discharging 
it in the tray that, due to its position, is constantly 
heated by the compressor cap in operation and therefore in 
its turn heats the water contained therein thus making it 
evaporate. All this is well known to the expert in the field and 
will therefore not be explained any further. It is also known that, in order to facilitate the mounting 
of the tray during assembly of the refrigerator, trays 
have been disclosed whose inside is formed substantially as a 
half-barrel in such a way that it is possible to insert the 
tray above the compressor head with a single horizontal movement, 
which is extremely advantageous considering that the 
compressor is normally housed in a space as small as possible 
to increase the useful volume of the refrigerating space. To 
lock the position of the tray against the compressor it is 
known to dispose e.g. a spring locking mechanism between the 
components, constituted by a first tongued coupling element 
fixed, usually welded, on the head of the compressor housing 
and a second spring fixing element for the coupling element, 
the second element being formed integrally with the material 
from which the tray is made. The FR-A-1 444 176 discloses a compressor corresponding 
to the preamble of claim 1. The tray is provided with 
two feet adapted to rest on the respective pipes and 
with a clamping strip which is attached around the 
pipes.  
 However this situation makes it difficult to assemble 
and particularly to disassemble the tray with the compressor 
in action, since it forces the operator to handle tools in 
uncomfortable conditions and to apply great attention and manual 
skill to free the spring mechanism. It would therefore be useful, and is the purpose of the 
present invention, to improve the construction of such compressors 
and

metal foil is locked with its end fixed to the tray within an 

expedient hollow (12) formed in the side of the tray. 
The compressor of claim 5, characterized in that the 
end locked within the hollow (12) has at least one reentrant 

curve (13) adapted to facilitate locking by interference of
