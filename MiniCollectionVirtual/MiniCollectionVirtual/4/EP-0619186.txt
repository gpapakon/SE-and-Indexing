<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for coating printing carriers in printing machines for applying water-based liquids of relatively high viscosity. The object of the invention is to develop a corresponding device for printing machines, which permits in-line processing of liquids of a relatively high viscosity of about 0.1 to 2 Pa s. The object is achieved in that an impression cylinder (2) is assigned to a forme cylinder (3) bearing a letterpress forme, an applicator roller (4) with a screen structure is assigned to the forme cylinder (3) and, at the same time, a chamber doctor (5) is assigned to the applicator roller (4). The chamber doctor (5) consists of a positive doctor (8) and a negative doctor (9) as well as side parts. Liquid of relatively high viscosity is fed via a conveying pump (7) to the chamber doctor (5), an excess pressure is built up inside the chamber doctor (5), the liquid of relatively high viscosity flows away via liquid drains (11) and is fed to a suction pump (6) with a reservoir (12).

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for coating material to be printed in 
rotary printing presses for multi-colour offset 

printing with at least one varnishing unit 
constructed as a flexo printing unit wherein the 

device (1) forming the varnishing unit consists of 
the following elements:
 
   a forme cylinder (3) carrying a relief forme 

which is in contact with an impression cylinder (2),
 
   an applicator roller (4) with raster structure 

which is in contact with the forme cylinder (3) and
 
   a chamber doctor (5), the positive doctor (8) 

of which is set against this in the direction of 
rotation of the applicator roller (4) and the 

negative doctor of which is set against this counter 
to the direction of rotation of the applicator 

roller (4), and that in the interior of the chamber 
doctor (5), an excess pressure can be generated in 

that a feed pump (7) is arranged in feed systems 
with a reservoir (12) prior to the chamber doctor 

(5) and thereafter a suction pump (6) in conduit 
systems with reservoir (12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the chamber doctor (5) with conduit system, feed 

pump (7) and suction pump (6) forms a closed system 
in which between feed pump (7) and suction pump (6), 

a common reservoir (12) is arranged. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the unit is arranged upstream of the offset print 

unit in an offset printing press as a functional 
module. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the device (1) is arranged as a functional module in  

 
an offset printing press between the offset printing 

units. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the device (1) is arranged downstream of the offset 

printing units in an offset printing press as a 
functional module. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
in an offset printing press, a further varnishing 

unit is arranged downstream of the device (1) which 
is formed at least by a varnish storage container 

and a scoop roller.
