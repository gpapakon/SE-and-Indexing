<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method and circuits for processing components of 
an input signal to provide a highly efficient linear amplifier and/or modulator or a 
demodulator. A LINC amplifier has been proposed (see D.C. Cox, "Linear Amplification Using 
Non-Linear Components", IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. COM-22, 1974, 
pages 1942 to 1945) in which a modulating signal is split into two phase modulated 
components with constant envelopes which can be amplified separately using highly 
non-linear but power efficient amplifiers. Combining the two output signals yields the 
desired linearly amplified signal. With a LINC amplifier the potential for dc to RF 
conversion efficiency can approach 100%, assuming ideal matching amplifiers. However, 
in practical LINC amplifiers, the suppression of broadband phase modulation relies on a 
very tight tolerance on the gain and phase match between the two paths. A gain error of 
0.01 dB and a phase error of 0.1 give a component suppression of only 54 dB. Such a 
tolerance is impossible to achieve in a open loop system where much greater gain and phase 
variations can occur with changes in operating frequency, output power and temperature, 
and the ageing of components. It is an object of this invention to provide a linear amplifier/modulator which does 
not suffer significantly from these problems. From GB 2073516 an arrangement for amplifying a previously modulated carrier 
signal using two phase locked loops is already known and in which phase feedback and 
phase comparators are used. In one embodiment the feedback signals are taken from a 
point before the final summing circuit. In practice the summing circuit will be imperfect 
and any phase errors introduced by the summing circuit will degrade the performance of 
the system. The input signal is at or near the same frequency as the output signal and where 
the output is to be at radio frequencies (RF) implementation of the summing circuits 14 and 
15 is, in practice, complicated. Such an arrangement could not receive a baseband signal 
and incorporate modulation of that signal within the phase locked loops. In a second embodiment of GB 2073516, the feedback signal is taken from a point 
after the final summing circuit. However comparisons with the input signal are made in  
 
terms of the amplitude and phase and, when the input is at RF, such a system requires 
accurate RF envelope detection and subtraction and a wide dynamic range RF phase 
detector. Such devices are difficult to construct.
