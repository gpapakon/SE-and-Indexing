<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a charge forming device of the 
venturi-type for gas fueled engines comprising a bleed air circuit 

including a bleed air control valve for controlling the air/fuel 
ratio supplied to the engine. Control means are provided for 

adjusting the bleed air control valve to supply a lean or an 
enriched air/fuel mixture to the engine for certain engine 

operating conditions such as cold starting, overheating or rapid 
engine deceleration, which necessitate an air/fuel ratio deviant 

from a theoretically ideal air/fuel ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a charge forming device of the
venturi-type for gas fueled engines comprising a bleed air circuit
including a bleed air control valve for controlling the air/fuel
ratio supplied to the engine.In general, the air/fuel mixture ratio of engines is enriched below a λ = 1
condition when operating at high speeds or under heavy loads, in order to keep the catalyst
from overheating. They are also usually run rich compared to λ = 1 when cold-started
to improve the starting characteristics of the engine. The "λ" referenced above is
defined as the actual air/fuel ratio divided by the theoretical air/fuel ratio. Accordingly, in
a stoichiometric state, λ is normally equal to 1 no matter what fuel composition is used.Since various fuel compositions are used in engines which are gas-fueled, it is
normally necessary to use a control map for each of the variety of fuel compositions. Such
maps specify the number of steps which are required to attain the aforementioned rich
running conditions, and their use poses an undue burden on the memory capacity of the
ECU.Also, for cold starts, a three-dimensional map is needed which takes into
account the engine rpm while cranking, the negative pressure in the air intake and the
aperture of the control valve (step number for the control motor). Such a map is normally
used to increase the amount of fuel supply, and this also puts an excessive burden on ECU
memory capacity. Further a specialized valve is conventionally present to
increase the fuel flow during times when operating in the
aforementioned overheated range or during cold starts, and the
incorporation of this valve complicates the structure and
increases costs.Another engine operating condition which necessitates
controlling the air/fuel mixture deviant from the theoretically
air/fuel ratio usually maintained, is a rapid deceleration after
high engine speed, wherein the fuel supply is usually cut off to
improve the fuel efficiency and to prevent unburnt fuel from
entering the exhaust system. It has been proposed to perform this
fuel cut-off in gas fueled engines by using a specialized solenoid
valve to reduce the fuel in the gas fuel passage.However, when such a specialized solenoid valve is used to
cut off the fuel supply, the fuel supply is cut off entirely when
the aforementioned rapid deceleration condition is detected and
when the above-mentioned valve is turned off. When the
deceleration stops, the valve switches back on to resume the fuel
flow. That means the fuel supply is steeply increased
