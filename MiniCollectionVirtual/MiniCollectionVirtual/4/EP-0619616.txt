<ABSTRACT>
PELTIER-effect device, especially for detecting a risk of condensation, including a substrate and semiconducting strips on the upper face of the said substrate, junctions connecting the said strips so as to form a series circuit constituted alternately by N-type strips (3) and P-type strips (4), all the junctions of the same type being situated in the central region of the upper face of the substrate and forming a detection region of the device. The semiconducting strips of the same type are arranged on the same side of the upper face of the substrate, which further includes a metallisation of its lower face forming junction strips (9).

Peltier-effect device, especially for detecting 
the risk of condensation on a surface lying in contact 

with a volume of humid air, comprising a substrate on 
which semiconductor strips are formed, these strips 

extending between a peripheral region and a central 
region of the upper face of the substrate, junctions 

connecting the said strips in order to form a series 
circuit consisting alternately of n-type strips and p-type 

strips, all of the junctions of the same type being 
located in the central region of the upper face of the 

substrate and forming a detection region of the device, 
characterized in that the n-type semiconductor strips (3) 

are arranged on one side of the upper face (1
a
, 1'
a
) of 
the substrate (1, 1') while the p-type semiconductor 

strips (4) are arranged on the other side of the upper 
face (1
a
, 1'
a
) of the substrate (1, 1'), the substrate 
(1, 1') comprising, in line with the end of each strip 

(3, 4) located in the peripheral region, a plated-through 
hole (8) passing through the substrate (1, 1') and 

emerging on the lower face (1
b
, 1'
b
) of the latter and a 
metallization of its lower face (1
b
, 1'
b
) forming 
junction strips (9) each connecting a through-hole (7) 

located in line with the end of a p-type strip (4) to 
another through-hole (7) located in line with the end of 

an adjacent n-type strip (3). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the junctions present in the central region of the 

upper face (1
a
, 1'
a
) of the substrate (1, 1') are covered 

with an electrically insulating and thermally conductive  
 

material (6) which joins them together in order to 
constitute the detection region of the device. 
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the substrate (1, 1') consists of 

silicon and in that the semiconductor strips (3, 4) are 
made of silicon doped by the thermal diffusion of 

impurities such as arsenic and boron. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the substrate (1) comprises, in its 

central part (2), an electrically and thermally 
insulating material such as a silicon oxide. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the substrate (1') comprises, in 

its central part, a recess (2') which extends from the 
upper face (1'
a
) of the substrate (1') to a depth greater 
than that of the semiconductor strips (3, 4) formed on 

the substrate (1'), the said strips (3, 4) thus being 
isolated from the bottom (2'
a
) of the recess (2') by a 
layer of air. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the junctions present in the 

central region of the upper part (1
a
, 1'
a
) of the 
substrate (1, 1') consist of surface metallizations 

partially covering the ends of the semiconductor strips 
(3, 4). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it comprises two semiconductor 

strips (3', 4') electrically isolated from the series 
circuit and forming a thermocouple.
