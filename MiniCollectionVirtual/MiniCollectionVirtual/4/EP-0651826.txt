<DESCRIPTION>
 FELINE INFECTIOUS PERITONITIS VIRUS TEST UTILIZING MONOCLONAL IDIOTYPIC AND ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIESThis application is identical to PCT/US92/06084 i filed 23 July 1992, now withdrawn. PCT/US92/06084 is a continuation of United States patent application Serial No. 07/736,513 filed 26 July 1991, which is still pending, which in turn is a continuation-in- part of United States patent application 07/586,207 filed 21 September 1990, which is also pending. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVarious nonspecific serum antibody tests for the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) are known. These known procedures include the testing of cat sera for immunofluorescent staining of coronavirus infected cell lines. Many of these assays rely upon the antigenic relationship which exists between FIPV and other coronaviruses and utilize either transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, canine coronavirus or human respiratory coronavirus. These assays accordingly provide only nonspecific detection of antibody to coronavirus common antigenic determinants. In particular because of the substantial antigenic similarity between FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV) , such assays cannot distinguish antibody to FIPV from FeCV.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThere is no known published record of monoclonal antibodies that distinguish FIPV from FeCV nor is there any published report of the application of anti-idiotypic technology to the study of feline antigens. i 

 This invention provides (a) novel hybridoma cell lines which produce a monoclonal idiotypic antibody designated 1030.2.3.1 that binds an antigenic determinant present on FIPV but absent on FeCV; and (b) monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies designated 2814.6 and 2848.6 that mimic epitopes of this FIPV specific determinant.This invention also provides an assay procedure in which such idiotypic and anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies are utilized to distinguish antibody to FIPV from FeCV. The invention also includes means including reagents useful to isolate an antigen from FIPV that is not shared by FeCV or to identify specifically the presence of FIPV in a sample that may or may not contain other feline viruses. The monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies of the invention are useful to identify antibody to FIPV but not FeCV in a cat's body fluids including, among others saliva, tears or peritoneal fluid, serum or plasma sample when production of an adequate amount of purified FIPV antigen for this purpose is not feasible.One embodiment of the invention
