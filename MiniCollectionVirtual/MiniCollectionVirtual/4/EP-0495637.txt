<ABSTRACT>
A foam-formed tissue ply is provided which is compacted, e.g. by 
embossing or calendering, to a percentage reduction in caliper of at 

least about 10% over at least about 10% of its area and in the thus 
compacted form exhibits a strength and/or softness which is superior 

to that of a correspondingly compacted like ply of a comparable water 
formed tissue having the same structure, overall fiber composition, 

basis weight and strength when in the uncompacted state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tissue having an improved combination of 
strength and softness. That is to say, improved strength is obtained 
at the same softness or improved softness is obtained at the same 
strength or improvements in both softness and strength are obtained, 
when compared with comparable tissues obtained by conventional 
water-formed processes. Aesthetics and tactile considerations are extremely important for 
tissue products as they often come into intimate contact with the most 
delicate parts of the body in use. Consequently, demand is quite 
high for products with improved tactile qualities, particularly 
softness. However, as tissue products are frequently used to avoid 
contact with that which the consumer would greatly prefer not to 
touch, softness alone is not sufficient; strength is also required. 
Merely providing a product with improved properties is not generally 
sufficient, the "on the shelf" appearance of the product must suggest 
both strength and softness while consumers must be able to sense 
improvements by handling packaged product. Appearance is critical; 
bulk, weight, compressibility, firmness, texture and other qualities 
perceived as indicia of strength and softness are also required. 
Further, since tissue products are disposables, low cost is of 
paramount importance. This application relates to compacted, e.g. embossed or calendered or 
both embossed and calendered, tissue products combining superior 
tactile properties with high strength which may be produced at high 
speeds on specially built tissue machines employing foam as the 
carrier in the forming loop. Unexpectedly, it has been found that 
tissues may be produced at low cost which, even though superficially 
comparable to existing state-of-the-art products in uncompacted form, 
possess in compacted, e.g. embossed or calendered form, exceptional 
softness and strength along with a surprisingly desirable combination 
of smoothness, formation, weight and luxurious appearance making them 
remarkably attractive to consumers.  
 Many ways are known for producing soft tissues. Some employ premium-priced ultra-fine 
fibers, such as eucalyptus, to achieve softness while others employ through-air drying 
processes which are known to be slow even for single ply products but are particularly costly 
for multi-ply products. The present tissues may be foam formed using commonplace fibers, 
rapidly dried in a conventional manner, then embossed achieving a combination of 
perceptible tactile properties and strengths
