<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal separator with substantially continuous discharge of the concentrate comprises a centrifuge drum (10) with axially spaced rings (24) projecting inwardly from the peripheral wall (15) of the drum. The material between the rings (24) is fluidized by injection of water (29, 34). Each channel between the rings (24) has a number of exit openings (40) at the base of the channel for discharge of the concentrate. Each exit opening (40) includes  a pinch valve (50) to restrict the discharge to predetermined time periods. Each exit (40) includes injection openings (83) around the exit for injecting water to replace the material discharged to maintain the fluidization between the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a centrifugal separator of the type which
can be used to extract heavier materials from a slurry containing the material
mixed with other materials.My published United States patents 4,776,833 and 4,608,040
disclose a device of this type which comprises a centrifugal bowl having a base
and a peripheral wall surrounding an axis passing through the base and
generally upstanding from the base to an open mouth, a plurality or axially
spaced inwardly projecting rings mounted on an inner surface of the peripheral
wall and a plurality of openings extending through the peripheral wall from the
outer surface to the inner surface thereof, the openings being arranged
between each ring and the next adjacent ring and in spaced relation around the
peripheral wall, means mounting the bowl for rotation about the axis, means for
feeding the materials into the bowl so that during rotation of the bowl they
flow over the peripheral wall for discharge from the open mouth and means for
applying fluid to the outer surface of the bowl so as to pass through the
openings and fluidize the materials between the rings, the openings passing
through the peripheral wall in a direction inclined to an axial plane passing
therethrough so as to tend to direct the fluid around the peripheral wall.This device has been found to operate very satisfactorily and in a
considerably improved manner relative to prior art devices. However it is a
batch discharge device in that the material separated between the rings
remains between the rings and after a period of time it is necessary to halt
operation of the bowl and to wash out the remaining material for collection and
final separation to retrieve the gold or other heavier material. There has long been a need and a desire for a separator of this
general type which operates in a continual mode, that is the mixture is fed in at
one point and two exit streams are retrieved, one including the heavier
materials and the other including the lighter materials.This requirement has become particularly important when a
separator of this type is employed in other industries such as the coal industry
for separation prior to combustion of the heavier sulfites from the coal to
reduce emission of sulfur dioxide to atmosphere during combustion and such as
the steel industry for separation of steel particles from soot. In these cases,
the amount of heavy material can make the process inefficient due to the stops
necessary for batch discharge.US Patent 2688437 (Monnet) discloses a

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for separating intermixed particulate materials
of different specific gravity in a slurry comprising:


a centrifuge bowl (10) having a base (16) and a peripheral surface
(15) surrounding an axis passing through the base and generally upstanding

from the base to an open mouth (17);
means (18,19) mounting the bowl for rotation about the axis;
a tubular duct (12) extending through the open mouth of the bowl
to a position adjacent the base for feeding the intermixed particulate materials

in the slurry into the bowl (10) so that during rotation of the bowl (10) the
intermixed particulate materials flow from the base over the 
peripheral surface
(15) for discharge of lighter particulate materials in the slurry from the open

mouth (17);
first guide means (36) for collecting the discharged lighter
materials in the slurry;
at least one annular recess defined on the peripheral surface (15)
spaced from the base and extending from the peripheral surface generally

outwardly from the axis, the recess being arranged such that the materials
flowing over the peripheral surface pass across the recess so that heavier

particulate materials free from the slurry preferentially collect in the recess and
lighter particulate materials in the slurry preferentially pass over the recess to

the mouth (17) for discharge therefrom;
said at least one recess being defined by a recessed base
surrounding the axis and by two generally annular side surfaces projecting

generally inwardly from the recessed base each on a respective axial side of 
the recessed base such that the recessed base around ifs full periphery is

recessed radially outwardly of a part of the peripheral surface defined by inner
edges of the side surfaces;
said at least one annular recess having therein a plurality of
fluidizing inlet jets (34) each connected to a source (25,29) of fluidizing liquid

and arranged to cause injection into the recess of the fluidizing liquid;

CHARACTERIZED IN THAT

a) said recessed base has therein a plurality of angularly
spaced discharge orifices (40) each arranged to communicate with the recess

at the recessed base and each extending substantially radially outwardly
therefrom, each discharge orifice (40) extending over only a small part of the

angular extent of the recessed base so as to leave a major part of the angular
extent of the recessed base free from said discharge orifices;
b) each orifice is connected to a respective tubular duct (71)
extending generally radially outwardly of the orifice; and
c) there is provided a valve (50) in the duct outwardly of the
orifice which is pulsed for intermittently closing and opening said duct (71) to

allow intermittent release of the heavier materials through said orifice.
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the valve (50)
in an open condition thereof has transverse dimensions greater than those of

the orifice and wherein said duct (71) diverges outwardly between the orifice
(87) and the valve (50) to allow discharge through the valve of a slug of the

heavier material collected in the duct.
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the valve
(50) comprises a fluid operated pinch valve having a pinch sleeve (53). 
The apparatus according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said
tubular duct and the valve comprise an insert member (70) separate from and

fastened to the bowl.
The apparatus according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein the
recess is continuous around the peripheral surface so as to provide a path
