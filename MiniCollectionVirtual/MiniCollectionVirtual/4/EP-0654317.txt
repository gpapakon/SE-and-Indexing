<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention there is now provided an 
edge rounded cutting tool insert (1) which shows less flank wear in 

the nose area (5) and improved toughness behaviour on the main cutting 
edge (2). This improvement has been obtained by decreasing the 

W/H ratio and increasing H from the nose area (5) to the middle of 
the main cutting edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool insert
according to the preamble of claim 1 and as known from EP-A-0 489 701.
The invention aims to further develop such insert through a special
microgeometry in order to obtain new and improved properties.Inserts for chip forming machining consist of at least one
main cutting edge and a connecting nose (corner). Such inserts
are produced by powder metallurgical methods milling, pressing
and sintering. As a result of the pressing operation the inserts
obtain rather sharp edges. However, sharp edges break too
easily when used. After the sintering the inserts are therefore
subjected to an edge rounding operation including lapping,
tumbling, brushing or blasting.The edge rounding can be described by the W/H-ratio where W
is the width of the edge rounding along the rake face and H is
the length of the edge rounding along the clearance face, see
FIG. 2. The edge rounding can also be closer defined in terms
of the radius on the rake face, R2, and on the clearance face,
R1.When lapping, tumbling or brushing are used the edge rounding
normally becomes larger in the nose area than along the
main cutting edge whereas edge rounding by blasting is difficult
to control with the desirable accuracy. In the prior art,
the W/H-value is often essentially constant around the edge
whereas the H-value varies. Moreover, in some cases no particular microgeometry
seems to be aimed at. The document EP-A-0 489 701 discloses a cutting insert having, in
the nose area and along the cutting edges, different values of
the ratio W/H. The present invention is based on the observation
that the non-uniform edge roundings recited in the patent claim
results in an insert with decreased flank wear and capable of
withstanding increased feed rates. 
FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of a cutting insert according
to the invention after an edge rounding operation.FIG. 2 shows a cross section of the insert of FIG. 1 along
the line II-II.FIG. 3 shows a cross section of the insert of FIG. 1 along
the line III-III.It has now been found that if a cutting insert is manufactured
in such a way that the W/H-ratio decreases and H increases
from the nose area to the middle of the main cutting
edge less flank wear in the nose area and improved toughness
behaviour on the main cutting edge are obtained. These favourable 
properties are particularly pronounced when machining
steel or stainless steel.As shown in FIG. 1, a cutting tool insert 1 includes a cutting
edge 2 between rake face 3 and clearance face and a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An edge rounded cutting tool insert comprising at least one main cutting
edge (2), a connecting nose area (5), a rake face (3) and a clearance face, the main cutting edge (2)

having a width W of edge rounding along the rake face and a width H of edge rounding
along the clearance face, a W/H ratio in the nose area being at least 1.25 times larger than

the W/H ratio in the middle of the main cutting edge (2), the H in the middle of the main
cutting edge (2) being at least 1.1 times larger than the H in the nose area (5) characterized in

that, the W/H in the middle of the main cutting edge (2) is 1.0 to 1.6, and the W/H in the nose
area (5) is 1.5 to 2.3.
