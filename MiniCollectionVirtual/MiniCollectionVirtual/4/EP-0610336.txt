<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an agent which prevents or inhibits
the action of interleukin-1 for the manufacture of a medicament
for treatment of neurological conditions.Neurological conditions pose serious clinical problems, as their effects are
severe and long-lasting but little is known of any really effective means for curing or
even controlling them.There is, therefore, a considerable need for some treatment for such
conditions.According to the present invention, there is provided the use of an agent which
prevents or inhibits the action of interleukin-1 for the manufacture of a medicament
for the treatment of a condition of cerebral neurological degeneration caused by
cerebral ischaemia or for the treatment of excitotoxic brain damage.Interleukin-1 is commonly referred to as "IL-1".The active agent thus defined has the effect of protecting neurons from
adverse effects, i.e. neuro-degeneration.The active agent used may be in a variety of forms, for example a naturally
occurring product or one produced by artificial or synthetic methods, for example a
genetically engineered form. Particularly suitable is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
protein (conveniently referred to as "IL-1ra"), particularly recombinant IL-1 ra. It is
also possible to use analogues of IL-1 ra, as well as derivatives and fragments thereof
(and analogues of these compounds).Our treatment is useful for a variety of conditions of neurological
degeneration, however caused, though the means by which the active agent we
specify here works is not yet clearly understood. It is believed that it is probably by
blocking the action of 
interleukin-1.Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a 17KDa cytokine is synthesised (W.L. Farrar
et al., Immunol.Rev. 100, 361, 1981) and acts within the central nervous
system to mediate several aspects of the acute phase response, and
directly modifies neuronal and glial function. An endogenous IL-1
receptor antagonist (IL-lra) has been identified (S.P Eisenberg et al.;
Nature, 343, 341, 1990) which binds to IL-1 receptors in peripheral
tissues and hippocampal neurones, and has been shown to inhibit many
peripheral actions of IL-1.Further evidence that IL-lra may be of benefit derives from
observations that the concentrations of IL-1 and related cytokines are
increased in brain in response to traumatic injury, cerebral ischaemia,
and HIV infection and administration of IL-1 worsens ischaemic brain
damage. (Gentleman et al (1993) Progr. Exp. Brain Res.(in press)) Thus,
blocking its actions by administration of
