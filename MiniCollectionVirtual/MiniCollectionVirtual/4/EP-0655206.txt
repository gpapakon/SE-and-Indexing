<ABSTRACT>
A shoe sole (1) structure for effecting an increased 
exercise to the wearer of a shoe with the shoe sole as well as 

the high shock-absorbency. The shoe sole (1) of the present 
invention comprises a rear sole section (2) forming a recess 

heel, a forward sole section (3) forming the grounding bottom 
of the shoe sole (1), and an intermediate sole section (4) 

between the forward and rear sole sections (3 and 2). In the 
intermedinate sole section (4) a wedge-shaped cushion member 

(5) is inserted to give the increased shock-absorbency and the 
constant coziness to the associated shoes while stimulating 

the arches of the wearer's foot with acupuncturing pressures. 
A return panel support (6) is buried in the rear sole section 

(2) to prevent the drooping of the recess heel assuring the 
constant coziness of wearing the associated shoes. In 

addition, the forward sole section (3) has at its rear side 
two or more grip members (9) to prevent the possible slippages 

of the shoes in the walking activity and also to tighten the 
cushion member (5) in the shoe sole (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to shoe soles, and
more particularly to a shoe sole structure for effecting an
increased exercise to the wearer of a shoe with the shoe sole
according to the preamble of claim 1.An athletic shoe of the kind referred to above is known from
from US-A-4 040 192.However, such sole lacks a means for resisting the
decrease of the shock-absorbency in the walking activities and
the drooping of the recessed heel area down to the ground
after longtime use of the sole.It is known
from US-A- 4 372 059
that the shoes have been provided with such a
construction that they protect the foot of the wearers in
their walking activities while serving as a means for
absorbing the grounding shocks of the foot.
Conventional shoes
generally have flat soles with or without the heels protruding
from the backward area of the soles. The walker with such
shoes will make the steps on the ground initially with the
sole of the forward shoe at its rear area which delivers the
full shocks from the ground to the walker's foot without any
cushioning effect of the front foot region and thus the
positive effect of exercising the walker which is
disadvantageous In DE-A-34 15 705 there are disclosed shoes having an elastic substructure comprising
a forward sole section extending from the toe to the region of ball and a short rear sole
section, both of which are interconnected by a rigid but elastic bridge section. An
elastic element is fixed to the underside of the bridge section.The primary object of the
present invention is to provide an
improved sole structure for being used with the, does to
enhance the amount of the exercise and thus the health of the
wearer of the shoes.Another object of the present invention is to improve the
shock-absorbency of the shoe sole while giving the better
feelings of wearing the shoes by providing a shoe sole having 
a means for stimulating certain areas of the wearer's soles,
the stimulating means also absorbing shocks from the walks.Yet another object of the present invention is to provide
a means for resisting the droops of the recessed heel of the
shoe sole even after a longtime use of the shoe sole.The foregoing objects in mind in accordance with the
present invention there is provided a shoe sole as set
out in claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
forward sole section has at its rear side a plurality of grip
means to tighten the cushioning means in the shoe sole and to 
prevent the slippage of the shoes in the walking activity;
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A shoe sole with a recess heel for being used with the shoes to enhance
the amount of the exercise and the health of the wearer of the shoes with

relatively short distance of walking, said shoe sole (1) comprising a rear sole
section (2) generally coextending with the area of said recess heel, a

forward sole section (3), an intermediate sole section (4) disposed between
said forward and rear sole sections and protruded giving a stepped bottom

to the shoe sole, 
characterized in that
 a wedge-shaped cushioning means
(5) is inserted and held in said intermediate sole section (4), and a return

panel support (6) is built in at least said rear sole section (2) to give a force
of restitution to the shoe sole (1) at the area covering said rear and intermediate

sole sections (2, 4).
A shoe sole according to claim 1, wherein said forward sole section (3) has
at its rear side a pluralitly of grip means (9) to tighten said cushioning

means (5) in said sole and to prevent the slippage of said shoes in the
walking activity.
A shoe sole according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said cushioning means (5)
includes a space (10) formed therein.
A shoe sole according to any preceding claim, wherein said return panel
support (6) comprises a panel stepped in conformity to said stepped bottom

of said shoe sole, said panel including a plurality of contoured protrusions
(7) and openings (8) to have an enforcement and a flexibility.
