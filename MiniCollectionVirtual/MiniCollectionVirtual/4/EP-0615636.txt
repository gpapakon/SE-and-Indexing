<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a setting device for a 
radiator valve having two parts that are rotatable with 
respect to one another about an axis, namely, a rotary 
knob and a base part, and a device for limiting the 
angle of rotation which comprises at least one stop 
member, which is fixed in the first of the parts in the 
direction of rotation, and at least one limiter, which 
is arranged to be fixed in the second of the parts in 
recesses in different positions in the direction of 
rotation. A setting device of that kind is known from 
DE 30 28 658 A1. Here, the base part has slot-like 
elongate openings distributed radially on the 
circumference and extending parallel to the axis, into 
which limit plates are arranged to be inserted. A 
stop member is provided inside the rotary knob. The 
rotary knob can be rotated only until the stop member 
engages one of the limit plates. Generally speaking, 
two limit plates are provided, which define the angle 
of rotation of the rotary knob upwards and downwards. 
In the assembled state, these limit plates can be 
changed over or removed from the setting device. 
Obviously, they are easily lost, since places for 
spares are provided, in which two spare limit plates 
can be stored. Furthermore, an additional limiting 
plate which cannot be removed using normal means is 
provided, and is fixedly installed on the other side of 
the normal positions of the limit plates in order to 
form an upper limit for the angle of rotation through 
which the rotary knob can turn should the normal limit  
 
plates be missing. This is intended to prevent the 
rotary knob from being unscrewed from the base part. 
The limit plates have an angled end which projects from 
the slots. They can be gripped at this end and 
withdrawn from the slots. By changing the position of 
the limit plates, the range of the angle of rotation of 
the rotary knob can be changed. A setting device having a similar effect is known 
from DE 21 48 967 B2. In that case, the base part has 
a ring which surrounds the rotary knob. The ring has 
a stop rib on its inner circumference. The rotary 
knob has a row of slots which extend axially starting 
from the front side. Stops can be introduced axially 
into these slots. In order to prevent these stops 
from falling out of the ribs, a cap is provided. 
Here too, there is a risk that the adjustable stops 
will be lost. Without stops, however, the rotary knob 
can be displaced over too wide a range, so that there 
is a risk of the radiator being set at too high or

<CLAIMS>
A setting device (1) for a radiator valve having two 
parts that are rotatable with respect to one another 

about an axis, namely, a base part (3) and a rotary knob (2), 
and a device for limiting the angle of rotation which 

comprises at least one stop member (16), which is fixed in 
the first of the parts (3) in the direction of rotation, 

and at least one limiter (10), which is arranged to be fixed 
in the second of the parts (2) in recesses (8) in different 

positions in the direction of rotation, characterized 
in that the first part (3) closes each of the recesses (8, 108) 

receiving the limiter (10, 110) at least sufficiently 
far for a movement of the limiter (10, 110) out of the 

setting device (1) to be blocked, at least in a 
pre-determined range of the angle of rotation, which 

includes the largest part of the angle of rotation. 
A setting device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the recesses (8, 108) for all 

possible positions of the limiter (10, 110) are 
interconnected by an annular space (5, 105), the 

recesses (8, 108) continuing in a radial and/or axial 
direction out of the annular space (5, 105) and having 

in the circumferential direction turning-moment 
engagement surfaces co-operating with the limiter. 
A setting device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the first part (3) has an 

integral projection (14) projecting into the annular 
space (5, 105) which blocks a radial and/or axial 

movement of the limiter (10, 110) out of the recesses 
(8, 108).  

 
A setting device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the integral projection (14) is 

interrupted in the circumferential direction only by 
the stop member (16) and in at least one region (17) 

immediately adjacent to the stop member, which region 
is about the width of the limiter (10, 110). 
A setting device according to claim 4, 
characterized in that an insert (19) is provided, which 

is arranged to be fixed in the region (17). 
A setting device according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the insert (19) is arranged to be 

introduced into the first part (3) from the side facing 
away from the second part (2).
