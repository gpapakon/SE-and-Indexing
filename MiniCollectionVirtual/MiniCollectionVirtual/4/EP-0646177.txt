<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to US Application Serial No.
07/800,365 filed November 27, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part
of US Application Serial No. 07/600,836 filed October 22,
1990, which is a continuation of US Patent Application Serial
No. 07/341,200 filed March 29, 1989, now US Patent No.
4,981,611, which, in turn, is derived from PCT Application
Serial No. PCT/US88/01844 filed May 31, 1988, which, in turn,
claims priority under 35 USC ยง120 from US Patent Application
Serial No. 07/056,500 filed May 29, 1987 (now abandoned). Each
of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference
in their entirety.The present invention relates to the expression of lipase
(cutinase) from Bacillus microorganisms and the purification of
cutinase from the fermentation broth.The secretion of heterologous proteins from any host requires
the precise matching of signal peptide and mature target gene.
Although gram-positive signal sequences are known to function
well in gram-negative systems, the inverse is not true
[Mountain, A. (1989) Bacillus (Biotechnology Handbooks 2, C.R.
Harwood, ed.), Plenum Press, pp. 73-114]. In the case of
Bacillus subtilis, it has been possible to secrete proteins
derived from other gram-positive organisms; however, even in
these situations, the best yields have been obtained with
hybrid sequences. There has been no documented success in
Bacillus for expressing large quantities of gram-negative
derived proteins utilizing their own signal sequences; in
addition, success with hybrid sequences has been minimal. 
[Mountain, A. (1989) Bacillus (Biotechnology Handbooks 2, C.R.
Harwood, ed.), Plenum Press, pp. 73-114.]There have been various attempts in the literature to optimize
signal peptide:mature gene fusions (cf. Doi, R.H., Wong, S. and
Kawamura, F. (1986) Trends Biotechnol. Sept.:232-235;
Fahnestock, S.R. and Fisher, K.E. (1986) J.Bact. 165:796-804;

Vasantha, N. and Thompson, L.D. (1986) J.Bact. 165:837-842);
however, in all cases, the points of fusion were chosen on the
basis of either convenient restriction sites or by merely
mating the gram-positive signal sequence to the target gene
directly at the signal cleavage site.The present invention describes the expression of the gram-negative
