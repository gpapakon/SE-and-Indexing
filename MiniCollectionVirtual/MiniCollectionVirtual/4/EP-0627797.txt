<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing contact elements from a 
strip of conductive material, wherein successive contact 

elements are formed in the strip by cutting away parts between 
the successive contact elements. Each contact element is made 

with a contact means with opposite contact faces for 
contacting a complementary contact element. The contact means 

of each contact element includes a twisted portion in such a 
manner that the contact means is twisted along an angle of 

substantially 90° with respect to the plane of the material 
strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system of printed
circuit boards, comprising a central printed circuit board
and further printed circuit boards at each side of the
central printed circuit board.In EP-A-0 627 789 of the same date and same applicant
a system of this type is described, wherein the further
printed circuit boards are mutually crossing each other
perpendicularly. The printed circuit boards are connected to
each other by means of at least one connector assembly. In
such a system contact pins are used with contact pin parts
projecting from the central printed circuit board at both
sides. Said projecting contact pin parts have contact faces
for contacting complementary contact elements. In manufacturing
such contact pins portions of a material strip between
subsequent contact pins are cut away and due to this cutting
step only two opposite faces of the contact pin parts are
suitable for contacting complementary contact elements.EP-A-0 047 469 discloses a method for manufacturing
contact elements with a contact pin part 1 including a
twisted portion 3 at one end and a female contact element at
the other end. The contact pin part 1 is inserted into a
plated through-hole of a printed circuit board and the pin
part 1 is used for wire-wrapping connections.US-A-3 530 422 discloses a connector with a housing
having a plurality of contact elements wherein the contact
elements are fixed in the housing by rotating a part of the
contact element when the contact element has been inserted
into the housing. The contact pin part of the contact
element is used for wire-wrapping connections. The invention aims to provide a system of printed
circuit boards wherein suitable contact faces are available
for contacting complementary contact elements at both sides
of the central printed circuit board.To this end the invention provides a system of
printed circuit boards, comprising a central printed circuit
board, a further printed circuit board at each side of the
central printed circuit board, said further printed circuit
boards mutually crossing each other perpendicularly, and a
connector assembly connecting the printed circuit boards to
each other, said connector assembly comprising a plurality
of contact pins having two contact pin parts with opposite
contact faces for contacting complementary contact elements
of the connector assembly, wherein at each contact pin one
contact pin part is twisted along 90° with respect to the
other contact pin part.The invention will be further explained by reference
to the drawings, in

System of printed circuit boards, comprising a
central printed circuit board, a further printed circuit

board at each side of the central printed circuit board,
said further printed circuit boards mutually crossing each

other perpendicularly, and a connector assembly connecting
the printed circuit boards to each other, said connector

assembly comprising a plurality of contact pins (1) having
two contact pin parts (4, 7) with opposite contact faces (5)

for contacting complementary contact elements of the connector
assembly, wherein at each contact pin (1) one contact

pin part (4) is twisted along 90° with respect to the other
contact pin part (7). 
System according to claim 1, wherein the surfaces
of said contact pin part (4) lying in the plane of the

strip are plated as contact faces (5) with a noble metal
before twisting the contact pin part.
System according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
contact pin (1) are cut loose from the strip after the

twisting step.
