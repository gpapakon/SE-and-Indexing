<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to spiral rolled membrane elements having continuous membrane sheets with folds (46, 48) or discontinuous sheets with seals (42, 44) and having permeate flow channels (38) attached to a porous polymeric hollow-core mandrel (31) in a regular and closely spaced array. A means of attaching permeate flow channels (38) having characteristics of a thermoset polymer to a thermoplastic mandrel (31) by means of ultrasonic welding is disclosed. The attaching means permits the attachment of a high density of permeate flow channels (38) per centimeter of mandrel (31) radius. The attaching means permits the flow channels (38) to be regularly located about the circumference of the mandrel (31) so as to facilitate the manufacture of a membrane element having a high degree of roundness. The invention also relates to processes of using the elements. The membrane element is suitable for a wide variety of fluid separations including microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis separations of liquids, and separations of gas mixtures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
spirally wound membrane devices useful for separation of
components of fluid feed streams by means known as
ultrafiltration, microfiltration, nanofiltration,
reverse osmosis, and separations of gas mixtures.Simple, single leaf spirally wound membrane
devices have been known for some time. For example,
GB-A-489,654 (September 1, 1938) describes a
countercurrent spiral membrane device containing a
cellulosic membrane material used for dialyzing caustic
soda lye. As discussed therein, with such a design it
is possible to fit considerable effective surface area
of dialyzing membrane into an extraordinarily small
volume, for example, a cylindrical container. Similar
single leaf spiral membrane devices are broadly used
today in a variety of applications. The advent of
reverse osmosis desalination of saline waters in the
early 1960's led to a number of improvements in spiral
membrane devices, especially in terms of size.
US-A-3,417,870 describes a means of spirally winding a
plurality of reverse osmosis membrane sheets and spacer
materials around a perforated hollow core in a manner so
as to provide large diameter spiral devices. The design 
illustrated and described in US-A-3,417,870 has
since been commonly applied to reverse osmosis,
ultrafiltration, gas separations, and other types of
membrane applications, The membrane element comprises a
plurality of membrane leaves. A permeate flow channel
is affixed to and surrounds a porous central mandrel.
Membrane leaves comprise semi-permeable membrane sheet
folded so as to enclose the feed flow channel on the
major surfaces separated by permeate fluid flow channel
sheets. The permeate flow channel sheets are placed
between folded major surfaces of semi-permeable
membrane. The membrane leaves of permeate flow channel,
semi-permeable membrane and feed fluid flow channel are
then wrapped about the central mandrel. The permeate
flow channel is sealed along the axial edges and
radially distal edge to prevent permeate fluid
communication with feed fluid. The feed fluid flow
channel sheets are open at the axial ends to feed fluid
flow axially through the spiral winding adjacent to the
semi-permeable membrane.US-A-4,235,723 describes an alternate
method of assembling spiral membrane devices, in which a
flow guide member is attached to a perforated hollow
core, and a parallel array of membrane envelopes are
attached together in a manner such that the permeate
from each membrane envelope empties into the flow guide
member. Such an
