<ABSTRACT>
A light irradiation device emits a visible light and 
an ultraviolet ray by using one light source to reduce an 

energy cost and simplify a mechanism. A light source 7, a 
first reflection mirror 8 and a second reflection mirror 

9 are provided in a case 6. A radiation light ranging 
from an ultraviolet area to a visible light area is 

emitted from the light source 7. The first reflection 
mirror 8 is a visible light reflection mirror and the 

second reflection mirror 9 is an ultraviolet ray 
reflection mirror. Of the light emitted from the light 

source 7, the visible light is reflected by the first 
reflection mirror 8 and the ultraviolet ray passes 

through the first reflection mirror 8 and is reflected by 
the second reflection mirror 9.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light 
irradiation device and more specifically to a light 
irradiation device for emitting visible light in a 
first direction and ultraviolet light in a second 
direction. More particularly, but not exclusively, 
the invention relates to a light irradiation device 
suitable for a head lamp of an automobile. When an ultraviolet light is irradiated to a 
fluorescent material, the material tends to emit a 
visible light. Recently, a traffic system which uses 
such ultraviolet ray (particularly a near-ultraviolet 
ray (UV-A) of 330-400 nm) to detect a fluorescent 
material at a distant point has been discussed. Fig. 
1 shows an example thereof in which a UV lamp 3 is 
added to a head lamp 2 of an automobile 1 and a UV 
(ultraviolet) ray emitted from the UV lamp 3 is 
irradiated to a pedestrian 4 at a distant point. In 
this case, if the pedestrian wears a cloth which 
contains many fluorescent materials such as cotton or 
nylon, a visible light (fluorescent) is emitted from 
the cloths when it is irradiated by the UV ray and the 
ray is caught by eyes of a driver to recognize the 
pedestrian 4. The visible light of the head lamp 3 irradiates 
a relatively near point as shown by a broken line 
arrow in Fig. 1 in order to prevent the light from 
affecting to a facing car, and a limit of the  
 
irradiation distance is 40-50 meters. On the other 
hand, since the near ultraviolet ray does not affect 
to the facing car and is harmless to a human body, it 
may be emitted parallelly to the ground so that a 
pedestrian of 150 meters ahead can be recognized. By the combination of the visible light and the 
ultraviolet ray, it is possible to construct a safer 
traffic system. In a prior art light irradiation 
device of this type, however, it is usual to 
separately arrange a light source for generating the 
visible light and a light source for generating the 
ultraviolet ray. However, the use of the two light 
sources is waste of energy and the construction of the 
device is complicated. DE-A-4108008 describes a vehicle headlamp with a 
reflector comprising two different parabolic sections. 
A gas discharge lamp is disposed at the focal point of 
one of the reflectors. A filter that is opaque to 
visible light and transparent to UV light is 
positioned between the lamp and one of the reflectors 
so that the one reflector emits a beam of UV light 
only and the other reflector emits a beam of UV and 
visible light. WO-A-89/03778 describes a vehicle headlamp 
comprising a reflector
