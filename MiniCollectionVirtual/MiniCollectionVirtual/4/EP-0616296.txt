<ABSTRACT>
In a method and apparatus for processing documents (30), a 
digital image of each document (30) is captured and stored in a memory 

(70). A feature model is formed from the stored image by extracting 
graphical features such as horizontal lines and/or boxes from the stored 

image, and this feature model is compared with stored feature models 
from an identification feature file (80) to identify the type of the 

document. The identification information is used to select, from a 
document definition file (82), an appropriate document description for 

identifying document zones to be read, and, from a library of image 
processing utilities (84), an appropriate processing utility, such as a data 

recognition utility to recognize the information read from such zones. 
The invention has an application to a self-service document processing 

terminal (10) for processing documents such as cheques (100) to be 
deposited or bills (150) to be paid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of processing documents of a 
plurality of types. The invention also relates to apparatus for processing documents 
of a plurality of types. The processing by financial institutions, such as banks, of 
financial documents such as cheques to be deposited and bills to be paid 
is a costly and time-consuming operation, and can often involve a 
customer wishing to perform a financial transaction, such as depositing 
a cheque or paying a bill, in a long waiting time to receive the attention 
of a bank teller to perform the transaction. The financial documents 
handled by the bank teller may be of many different types with differing 
information layouts, and contain information which may be handwritten 
or printed in any one of a wide variety of typefonts. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and 
apparatus for processing documents wherein information contained in 
various locations on a variety of different document types can be 
automatically extracted and processed. Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided a method of processing documents of a plurality of types, 
including the steps of: forming a digital image of a document to be 
processed; and storing the digital image, characterized by the steps of: 
extracting from the stored digital image graphical features of said 
document; identifying the document type to which said document 
belongs on the basis of the extracted graphical features; utilizing the 
identified document type to select an appropriate stored document 
description; utilizing the selected document description to select at least 
one zone of the stored digital image and to select an image processing 
program; and processing the information contained in the selected zone 
or zones in the stored image using the selected image processing 
program. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided apparatus for processing documents of a plurality of types, 
including transport means adapted to move a document; imaging means 
adapted to provide digital image signals representing an image of said 
document; and image storage means adapted to store said image signals,  
 
characterized by processing means coupled to said image storage means 
and adapted to extract graphical features from the stored image of said 
document and to compare the extracted graphical features with 
corresponding graphical features associated with a plurality of document 
feature models arranged in a
