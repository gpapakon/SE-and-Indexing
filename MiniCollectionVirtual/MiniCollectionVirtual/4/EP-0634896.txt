<ABSTRACT>
A soluble immunosuppressive factor present in serum derived from tumor-bearing mammals, is associated with changes in TCR protein subunit levels, T lymphocyte signal transduction pathway proteins. These changes provide a method of determining the level of immunosuppression in a mammal by determining the level of expression of at least one selected TCR subunit protein, a protein in the T lymphocyte signal transduction pathway, or of the NF- kappa B/rel family and comparing the level and pattern to that found in non-immunosuppressed individuals. The method is useful to identify patients having T lymphocytes capable of activation for immunotherapy and for identifying agents which cause or reverse immunosuppression. An isolated immunosuppressive factor associated with the level of expression of the proteins is useful for suppressing the immune response, for example, in organ transplantation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is a continuation-in-part
application of U.S. Serial No. 07/863,262, filed April 6,
1992, and U.S. Serial Number 07/987,966, filed December
11, 1992.The invention relates to a soluble immunosuppressive
factor produced by cells of a tumor-bearing mammal and to
a gene encoding said factor. Screening methods for
agents inhibiting or reversing the action of this factor
are identified. Immunosuppressive agents and counter-agents
are recognized using the invention. The factor
may be used to induce immunosuppression. The present
invention also relates to the evaluation, selection and
treatment of patients with diseases causing progressive
immunosuppression. Patients having a disease responsive
to immunotherapy, especially cancer patients, are staged
or evaluated based on expression levels of proteins
affected by immunosuppression. The likelihood of success
of such immunotherapy is predicted by the results of
staging and evaluation.Many diseases are characterized by the development
of progressive immunosuppression in a patient. The
presence of an impaired immune response in patients with
malignancies has been particularly well documented.
Cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice have been shown to
have a variety of altered immune functions such as a
decrease in delayed type hypersensitivity, a decrease in 
lytic function and proliferative response of lymphocytes.
S. Broder et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 299: 1281 (1978);
E.M. Hersh et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 273: 1006 (1965);
North and Burnauker, (1984).Many other diseases are also characterized by the
development of an impaired immune response. For example,
progressive immunosuppression has been observed in
patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),
sepsis, leprosy, cytomegalovirus infections, malaria, and
the like. The mechanisms responsible for the down-regulation
of the immune response, however, remain to be
elucidated.The immune response is a complex phenomenon. T
lymphocytes (T cells) are critical in the development of
all cell-mediated immune reactions. Helper T cells
control and modulate the development of immune responses.
Cytotoxic T cells (killer T cells) are effector cells
which play an important role in immune reactions against
intracellular parasites and viruses by means of lysing
infected target cells. Cytotoxic T cells have also been
implicated in protecting the body from developing cancers
through an immune surveillance mechanism. T suppressor
cells block the induction and/or activity of T helper
cells. T cells do

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining the level of immunosuppression in a sample of mammalian T
lymphocytes, said method comprising the steps of:


a) determining the level of expression of a TCR subunit protein selected from CD3ζ,
CD3γ or protein Fcεγ, and
b) comparing said level of protein expression with the level of expression of said
protein characteristic of non-immunosuppressed individuals of the same

mammalian species.
The method of claim 1, wherein said level of expression is measured as an expression
ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of T lymphocytes expressing said protein to the

total number of T lymphocytes counted.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said T lymphocytes are derived from spleen
tissue, peripheral blood, tumor tissue, lymph node tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural

effusions and ascites.
A method of identifying an agent which causes immunosuppression of mammalian T
lymphocytes, said method comprising the steps of:


a) providing a mammalian T lymphocyte preparation wherein the level of expression
of a TCR subunit protein selected from CD3ζ and CD3γ is characteristic of non-immunosuppressed

individuals of the same mammalian species;
b) culturing said lymphocyte preparation in the presence of a suspected
immunosuppressive agent;
c) determining the level of expression of said selected protein; and
c) identifying an agent which causes a significant reduction below the level of
expression of said protein in a T lymphocyte preparation not cultured in the

presence of the agent.
A method of identifying an agent which reverses immunosuppression of mammalian T
lymphocytes, said method comprising the steps of:


a) providing a mammalian T lymphocyte preparation from an immunosuppressed
mammal, wherein the level of expression of a TCR subunit protein selected from

CD3ζ and CD3γ is below the level of non-immunosuppressed individuals of the
same mammalian species;
b) culturing said lymphocyte preparation in the presence of an agent suspected of
reversing immunosuppression;
c) determining the level of expression of said selected protein in the culture; and
d) identifying an agent which causes a significant increase in the level of expression
of said protein.
A method to screen for an agent that inhibits a soluble immunosuppressive factor, said
method comprising:


a) adding an agent to a cellular system that contains a soluble immunosuppressive
factor that is capable of effecting a 
decrease in the level of a TCR subunit protein
selected from CD3ζ and CD3γ in a biological specimen from an immunosuppressed

mammal in comparison with the level of the subunit in a comparable biological
specimen from a non-immunosuppressed mammal, wherein said cellular system is the

supernatant derived from the MCA-3 8 cell line or the MBL-2 lymphoma;
b) determining the level of irnmunosuppression in the system by:

i) determining the level of expression of a TCR subunit protein selected from
CD3ζ and GD3γ, and
ii) comparing said level of protein expression with the level of expression of
said protein characteristic of non-immunosuppressed individuals of the

same mammalian species; and
c) determining whether the system exhibits a reversal of immunosuppression.

from the MCA-38 cell line or the MBL-2 lymphoma and wherein said soluble

immunosuppressive factor is capable of effecting a decrease in the level of a T 
lymphocyte signal transduction pathway protein in a biological specimen from a

mammal in comparison with the level of the protein in a comparable biological
specimen from a non-immunosuppressed mammal.
A method according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the immunosuppressed mammal is
a mouse having a tumor of the MCA-38 line or the MBL-2 lymphoma present for

about 26 days or more.
A kit for use in the method of any one of claims 1-8, comprising in a separate container
an antibody directed against a TCR subunit protein selected from CD3ζ, CD3γ or Fcεγ

and means for detecting the formation of an antibody-antigen complex.
