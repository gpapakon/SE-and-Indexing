<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of displaying video text or telephone data, as well as to an improvement to the method making it possible, from this display data, to control the programmes received by a television set. The present invention also relates to a device for implementing this method and to its improvement. The present invention relates to a method of displaying video text or telephone data which is characterised in that it includes the following stages:       . reception and decoding of the said data, . transmission of the data to a television and/or video recorder control panel, . reception and display of the said data on a display device of the control panel. The present invention applies to all types of television sets capable of receiving at least one video text service or data by telephone directly or via an independent remote control.

Process for displaying videotext data or data
sent via the telephone, characterized in that it

comprises the following steps:

reception and decoding of the said data by a
receiver/decoder device (2) situated in the television

(1) or a video recorder, or connected to the latter,
sending of the data to a control device (6) for
the television (1) and/or for the video recorder,
reception and display of the said data on a
display device (10) of the said control device (6).
Process according to Claim 1 characterized in
that it comprises an additional step of encoding in a

format optimizing the display on a screen (10) of the
said data, once the latter have been received and

decoded.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the data are modulated

before being sent to the control device (6).
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that all the data or some of

these data are stored in memory (8) and displayed on
command from the user.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the microprocessor

controlling the screen (10) of the control device (6)
is furnished with software which makes it possible to

select either by automatic recognition of the
associated code corresponding to the kind of the

transmission, or by recognition of the syntax of the
characters sent to the display device (10), the data

corresponding to the programme of transmissions
received by the television (1) and to display them by

kind.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the data are displayed on

a touch screen (10) of the control device (6) and are
processed by a microprocessor comprising software for 

recognizing the characters displayed on the display
device (10), making it possible, by selecting a line,

to programme the television (1) and/or the video
recorder.
System allowing the display of videotext data
or data sent via the telephone on a television screen

characterized in that it comprises a receiver/decoder
device (2, 3) for these data, a device (5) for sending

these data towards a control device (6) comprising a
device (7) for receiving these sent data as well as a

display device (10).
Display system according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the display device (10) is a flat

screen of the liquid-crystal or plasma type.
Display system according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the display device (10) is a

touch screen.
Display system according to Claim 9,
characterized in that it is controlled by a

microprocessor (9) comprising a function for
recognizing the syntax or the identification code of

the characters displayed on the display device (10).
Display system according to Claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that it implements the process

according to any one of Claims 1 to 5.
Display system according to either of Claims 9
and 10, characterized in that it implements the process

according to Claim 6.
