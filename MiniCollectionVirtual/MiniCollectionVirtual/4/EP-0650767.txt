handle (3) equipped with a trigger (4) having an 

active portion (4a) inside the handle (3) itself 
and an external portion (4b) that may be operated 

by hand, and a front extension (5); a revolving 
block (6) rotatably coupled to the extension (5) 

and mounting a liquid dispensing unit (8) that 
comprises a cover (9) for closing the end of the 

extension (5) and nozzles (1) connected to 
corresponding dispensing cylinders (10); by turning 

the revolving block (6), each cylinder (10) may be

the trigger (4); the liquid dispensing unit in the 
revolving block (6) also has a first tube (12) for 

each cylinder (10) and connecting the latter to a 
corresponding second tube (13) which feeds the 

liquid to be sprayed; compressive means (15) are 
located between the active end of the trigger (4) 

and the corresponding cylinder (10) in order to 
force the liquid out of the cylinder (10) towards  

 
the nozzle (1); finally, spring means (16) are 

envisaged to operate on the compressive means (15) 
in such a way as to determine a force 

counteropposing the force of the liquid discharge

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiple nozzle,
liquid spray-gun, particularly useful for cleaning
surfaces.At present, manually operated liquid dispensing
pumps, commonly known as spray-guns (the term
"spray-gun" being used hereinafter as a synonym for
"liquid dispensing pump") constitute one of the
most convenient, effective and safe means of
cleaning surfaces of various kinds; the said spray-guns
are used to dispense liquids which attack the
particles of dirt on the surfaces to be cleaned.These spray-guns (for example, see patents EPO -
262.484 or US 4.260.079) consist basically of a
spray-head attached (for example by screwing) to a
tank containing the liquid to be sprayed. The
spray-head has a discharge nozzle and internally
defines a pumping chamber which enables the liquid
to be drawn from the tank and channelled towards
the discharge nozzle.The flow of the liquid within the chamber is
controlled by the user through an external lever or 
trigger which operates on the part of the pumping
chamber located inside the spray-head and designed
to control the operation of nonreturn valves
mounted by the discharge nozzle and by the pumping
chamber. To start operating the spray-gun, the user
must alternately pull and release the trigger
several times in such a way as to increase the
pressure in the pumping chamber, thus opening the
valve at the tank end to draw liquid from the tank
itself, and closing the valve at the discharge
nozzle so as to fill the liquid drawn from the tank
into a prechamber (either rigid or flexible)
adjacent to the nozzle itself.The next time the trigger is released after the
prechamber has filled with liquid, the valve at the
nozzle opens, allowing some of the liquid to pass
from the prechamber to the nozzle so that, when the
trigger is next pulled, the valve closes again and
the liquid is discharged to the atmosphere through
the nozzle.Although the systems adopted until now to pump the
liquid from the tank or container to the nozzle
differ from each other in complexity (for example,
delayed-action springs to open the nozzle or
systems with multiple relief valves), all the 
spray-guns disclosed in prior patents are single-purpose
or "dedicated" spray-guns. In other terms,
a user who wishes to clean different types of
surfaces must have the corresponding number of
individual containers with a different spray-head
for each different type of liquid to be sprayed.The results are a cumbersome load of equipment to
be carried around by a user who needs to have a
spray-gun handy for

<CLAIMS>
A liquid spray-gun with multiple nozzles (1)
comprising:


a handle (3) with a lever or trigger (4) having
an active portion (4a) inside the handle (3)

itself and an external portion (4b) that may be
operated by hand, and a tubular extension (5);
a tubular, revolving element or block (6)
rotatably coupled to the said tubular extension

(5) by appropriate means (7); the said revolving
block (6) mounting, at its free end, a liquid

dispensing unit (8),
characterised in that said liquid dispensing unit (8) comprises

a cover (9) for
closing the said free end and at least two

nozzles (1) connected to corresponding dispensing
cylinders (10); it being possible by turning the

said revolving block (6) to line up each of the
cylinders (10) with the internal active end of

the trigger (4); the said revolving block (6)
enclosing a liquid dispensing unit comprising for

each of the said dispensing cylinders (10) a
first tube (12) connecting the related cylinder

(10) to a corresponding second liquid supply tube 
(13) which is connected to a tank (14) from which

it draws the liquid to be sprayed;
compressive means (15) being located between
the active end of the said trigger (4) and the

corresponding cylinder (10), rotatable together
with the latter and designed, when activated by
