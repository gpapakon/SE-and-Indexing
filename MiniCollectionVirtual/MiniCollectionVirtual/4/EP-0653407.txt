<ABSTRACT>
A method for conjointly preparing tertiary butyl 
alcohol and ditertiary butyl peroxide wherein a solution of 

a tertiary butyl hydroperoxide feedstock in tertiary butyl 
alcohol is charged to a hydroperoxide decomposition reaction 

zone containing a catalytically effective amount of a 
hydroperoxide decomposition catalyst consisting essentially 

of palladium supported on pelleted carbon, and is brought 
into contact with the catalyst in liquid phase under 

hydroperoxide decomposition reaction conditions to convert 
the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide to decomposition products, 

principally tertiary butyl alcohol and ditertiary butyl 
peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the conjoint production of 
tertiary butyl alcohol and ditertiary butyl peroxide from 
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a continuous catalytic method for the conjoint 
production of tertiary butyl alcohol and ditertiary butyl 
peroxide from a solution of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in 
tertiary butyl alcohol. Still more particularly, this 
invention relates to a continuous method for the conjoint 
production of tertiary butyl alcohol and ditertiary butyl 
peroxide by bringing a tertiary butyl alcohol solution of 
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide into contact with a pelleted 
carbon catalyst having palladium deposited thereon. It is known to react isobutane with oxygen, either 
thermally or catalytically, to form a peroxidation reaction 
product wherein the principal peroxide that is formed is 
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. It is also known to thermally 
or catalytically decompose the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide to 
form tertiary butyl alcohol. It is also known, as pointed out 
in US-A-4,810,809 and 4,900,850 that ditertiary butyl peroxide 
is a minor constituent of the reaction product. Ditertiary 
butyl peroxide is a valuable commercial product used, for 
example, as a high temperature free radical initiator in 
chemical reactions. These two patents disclose methods that 
can be used to recover purified ditertiary butyl peroxide from 
a reaction product formed by the thermal or catalytic 
decomposition of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide.  
 Sanderson et al. disclose the use of a variety of catalysts 
for the decomposition of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in 
a series of U. S. patents, including a catalyst composed of 
unsupported nickel, copper, chromia and iron (U. S. Patent No. 
4,704,482), a catalyst composed of iron, copper, chromia and 
cobalt (U. S. Patent No. 4,705,903), a catalyst composed of a 
base treated hydrogenation catalyst from groups VIA or VIII of 
the Periodic Table (U. S. Patent No. 4,742,179), a catalyst 
consisting essentially of nickel, copper, chromium and barium 
(U. S. Patent No. 4,873,380), a catalyst composed of a metal 
phthalocyanine promoted with a rhenium compound (U. S. Patent 
No. 4,910,349), a catalyst composed of a base promoted metal 
phthalocyanine compound (U. S. Patent No. 4,912,269), a 
catalyst composed of a soluble ruthenium compound promoted 
with a bidentate ligand (U. S. Patent No. 4,912,033), a 
catalyst composed of a metal porphine such as iron (III) or 
manganese (III) promoted with an alkyl
