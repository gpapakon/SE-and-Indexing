<ABSTRACT>
An engine revolution counter comprises a mount 2 
having electric source terminals 20 for the supply of 

electric power from outside and measuring mode setting 
terminals 21 through 23. A measuring part main body 1 

which is mountable on said mount in a freely attachable 
and detachable manner has measuring mode setting 

switches 6 and a display panel 10 on the front face 
thereof to display measured results, and also has means 

for measuring the number of revolution of the engine. 
The electric source terminals 20 and the measuring mode 

setting terminals 21 through 23 are connected to 
respective each of electric source terminals 16 and 

measuring mode setting terminals 17 through 19 provided 
in said measuring part main body 1, to conduct external 

electrical energy to the body 1, for example to power a 
light, and to allow for the connection of external mode 

setting devices to the body 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine
revolution counter capable of being used for measurement
of the number of revolutions of an internal combustion
engine having from one cylinder up to twelve cylinders,
for example.A rotating speed meter of an engine, a so-called
tachometer, is installed on the dash board display of a
vehicle such as a car, so that a driver can read
directly the number of revolutions per minute (r.p.m.)
of the engine whilst the car is either stationary or in
motion.An analog display is usually used for the purpose
but a digital display such as a segmented bar display,
or a pattern display at 100 rpm intervals, may also, for
example, be used. These types of displays suffice for
monitoring of normal driving situations.However, for special vehicles such as racing cars,
for example, there are situations where a driver and
mechanics may wish to determine, in real time, the
r.p.m. of the engine in more detail, either in the car
or from outside the car, to monitor the condition of the
engine. In particular the driver may wish to monitor
the r.p.m. of the engine as well as a lap time, a split
time, a clock, total driving time and the like. However
it may be difficult to achieve this with conventional
tachometers, as presently installed in vehicles.The present invention seeks to provide an engine
revolution counter capable of displaying simultaneously
the number of revolution of the engine as well as other
necessary measured data such as lap time, split time and
so on.EP-A-0439996 (Environmental Systems Products Inc.)
discloses an engine revolution counter comprising a main
body part, said main body part comprising means for 
measuring the revolutions of an engine, display means
for displaying the revolutions measured and selected
other data, display mode switch operating members and
first electrical terminal means.The invention is characterised in that said counter
also comprises a mount to which said main body part may
be removably mounted, said mount comprising second
electrical terminal means for connection to said first
terminal means, said counter also having means for
connection to an external power source, and in that
selected first and second terminals are electrically
connected to external measuring mode setting switch
means, and to mode setting circuitry inside the counter,
whereby the display mode may be set by operating the
switch operating members and/or by the external switch
means.In a preferred embodiment, the engine revolution
counter according to the present invention
