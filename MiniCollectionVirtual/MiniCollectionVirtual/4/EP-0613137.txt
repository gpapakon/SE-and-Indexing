<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for recording a defective-position indicating signal on a nonrecorded 
WO disk, comprising a laser beam source such as a laser diode (30) for generating a 

laser beam to be irradiated onto the disk; an optical detector (40) supplied with the laser 
beam reflected from the disk; an FM demodulator (51) for demodulating the FM output 

signal of the optical detector (40); a defect detector (55) for detecting a defect on the 
disk by comparing the output signal level of the FM demodulator (51) with a reference 

value;
 

and a laser power controller (35) normally functioning to modulate the power of the 
laser beam by a fixed-frequency signal, or functioning, in response to detection of a 

defect, to maintain the laser beam power at an adequate recordable level for a first 
predetermined time after such detection. A detection controller (58) is also included for 

interrupting the operation of the defect detector under control for a second 
predetermined time after the detection of the defect. The first predetermined 
time is 
approximately equal to one period of an FM carrier, and any dropout inclusive of micro 

DO can be completely detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for recording a defective-position indicating signal at
a defective position on a recording disk medium.Fig. 5 shows the constitution of an optical
pickup for a WO (write once) disk on which a signal is
recordable only once.In this diagram, reference numeral 1 denotes a
laser diode (semiconductor laser) serving as a laser
beam source, and reference numeral 2 denotes a laser
driver for driving the laser diode 1. The laser beam
outputted from the laser diode 1 is irradiated to a WO
disk 7 through a coupling lens 3, a beam splitter 4, a
1/4 wavelength plate 5 and an objective lens 6.In a recording mode, a record signal is
modulated in a modulator 8 and is supplied to the laser
driver 2, so that the power of the laser beam outputted
from the laser diode 1 is modulated by the record signal 
(modulating signal), and then such record signal is
recorded on the disk 7. Meanwhile in a playback mode,
the power of the laser beam outputted from the laser
diode 1 is kept at a fixed value.The laser beam reflected by the beam splitter
4 is transmitted through a condenser lens 9 and is
incident upon a photo diode 10 which serves as an
optical detector. The detection output of the photo
diode 10 is supplied to an APC (automatic power
controller) 11, which then controls the laser driver 2
so that the power of the laser beam outputted from the
laser diode 1 is controlled to an optimal value in each
of the recording and playback modes.The laser light reflected from the disk 7 is
incident upon a dividing photo diode 14 via the 1/4
wavelength plate 5, the beam splitter 4, a condenser
lens 12 and a knife edge prism 13. The divided output
signals of the photo diode 14 are mutually subtracted in
an operational amplifier 15 to be thereby formed into a
focus error signal. This signal is then supplied to a
focusing driver 16, so that the current flowing in a
focus coil 17 is controlled with a focus servo action.Meanwhile the laser beam reflected from the
knife edge prism 13 is incident upon the dividing photo 
diode 18. The divided output signals of the photo diode
18 are mutually subtracted in an operational amplifier
19 to be thereby formed into a tracking error signal.
This signal is then supplied to a tracking driver 20, so
that the current flowing in a tracking coil 21 is
controlled with a tracking servo action.In a playback mode, the divided output signals
of the photo diode 14 are mutually added in an
operational amplifier 22 to become a playback signal,
which is then supplied to
