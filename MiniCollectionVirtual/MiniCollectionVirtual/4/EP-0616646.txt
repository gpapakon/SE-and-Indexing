<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for the thermal treatment of metal products in a roller oven, in particular relatively thin steel articles which distort easily on heating, such as raceways for ball bearings, circular sheet blanks, saw blades and other cutting blades. The products are conveyed through the oven on ceramic rollers and thus heated, and very rapidly and uniformly cooled again so that no distortion occurs.

<CLAIMS>
Method for hardening relatively thin, fast coolable
steel parts in a roller furnace, wherein after a heating

phase the steel parts directly resting on the ceramic
rollers of the roller furnace are brought into the so-called

high temperature range above 800 - 1250 Â°C and are
transported on the roller conveyor into the cooling zone,

characterised in that the steel parts are cooled below the
initial martensite temperature in the cooling zone in a

spatially regular, locally simultaneous and very fast way
by means of air nozzle fields with impact streams arranged

above as well as below the roller conveyor.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that air
is sucked off between the individual nozzle fields in order

to suck off the boundary layer.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
cooling is carried out with heat-transfer coefficients in

the range from 1000 to 4000 W/m
2
K.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that steel
parts like ball-bearing rings, knifes, saws, pliers,

milling cutters and similar items are hardened.
Method according to claim 1 characterised in that the
air nozzles are operated continuously or intermittently.
