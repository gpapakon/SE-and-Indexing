<CLAIMS>
Piston for a compression gun for forcing substances (13) out 
of foil bags (5), comprising a central engagement part (14) for 

a piston rod (8) and a scraping edge (15), which protrudes 
radially over the engagement part (14) and at least partially 

surrounds the engagement part (14), 
characterized in that
 
the scraping edge (15) can be to an axially defined extent 

transposed relative to the central engagement part (14). 
Piston according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the central 
engagement part (14) and the scraping edge (15) comprise 

co-acting means for defined axial transposition. 
Piston according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 co-acting 
means of protrusions (22) of the scraping edge (15) are 

formed, which are oriented towards the centre. 
Piston according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the free 
end of the protrusions (22) is essentially T-shaped. 
Piston according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 co-acting 
guide means are established on the central engagement part 

(14). 
Piston according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 guides are 
formed for slots (21), which are open toward the outer contour 

of the central engagement part (14) and which extend in the 
longitudinal direction of the central engagement part (14). 
Piston according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the slots 
(21) extend over 70% to 90% of the total length of the central 

engagement part (14).
