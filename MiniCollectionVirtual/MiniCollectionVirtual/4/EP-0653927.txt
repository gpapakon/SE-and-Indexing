<ABSTRACT>
A femoral prosthesis is disclosed comprising a bicondylar femoral component (41), a tibial component (72) and at least one meniscal component (42) interposed between the femoral and tibial components, the fermoral component including a pair of condylar surfaces (46) separated by a patella bearing surface (44) which in use provides a normal anatomical patella lever arm, the condylar surfaces being shaped for substantial conformity with corresponding tibial bearing surfaces (47) of the meniscal component or components over the entire range of normal flexion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prosthesis for knee
replacement. In the replacement of diseased or deformed
knee joints, the arthritic or otherwise damaged joint
surfaces are resected and replaced with artificial metal
and plastic surfaces. Current designs have centred on a
prosthesis having three components, i.e. a femoral
component designed to replace the condylar surfaces of the
natural knee joint and having provision for guidance of
the natural or a replacement patella, a tibial component
which includes a generally horizontal support plate fixed
to the resected tibia and a meniscal component, normally
of plastics material, which is attached to the tibial
component and is shaped to provide a bearing surface for
the condylar portions of the femoral component.
The features of the preamble of Claim 1 are
known from the document WO-A- 92 03 108.Existing commercial designs have provided for some
degree of laxity between the femoral component and the
meniscal component in order to allow for limited freedom
of motion within the artificial joint in use. This is
necessary in order to mimic to some extent the natural
motion of the joint which includes rotation in a
horizontal plane as well as some forward and backward
relative motion during flexion.One disadvantage of permitting some laxity between
the bearing surfaces of the femoral component and the
tibial component is that this results in high contact 
pressures and stresses on bearing surfaces, since laxity
is conventionally achieved by providing a low degree of
conformity between the mutually bearing surfaces.It is a primary object of the present invention to
provide a knee prosthesis which includes a high degree of
femoral, tibial conformity but at the same time, is
capable of permitting some degree of anterior-posterior
motion and rotational motion during flexion.According to
the present invention
there is provided a prosthesis which comprises the features of Claim 1.
By the entire range
of normal flexion we mean 0째 to about 120째, preferably to
about 130째 or 135째.Further features and advantages of the present
invention will become apparent from the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figures 1(a), (b), (c) and (d) illustrate prior art
approaches to the problem of providing a prosthesis 
mimicking the movement of a natural joint,Figures 2(a), (b) and (c) illustrate approaches to
the solutions to the problems presented in the prior art,Figures 3(a), (b), (c) and (d) show various
diagrammatic views of one embodiment in accordance with
the invention,Figures 4(a),
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A prosthesis which comprises a bicondylar femoral component
(41), a tibial component (72) and at least one meniscal component (42) interposed

between the femoral and tibial components, the femoral component including a
pair of condylar surfaces (46) separated by a patella bearing surface (44) which in

use provides a normal anatomical patella lever arm, characterised in that the
condylar surfaces are shaped for substantial conformity 
with corresponding tibial
bearing surfaces (47) of the meniscal component or components over the normal

range of flexion and the condylar components are formed with cut away portions
(43) anteriorly to provide close conformity in extension without affecting the

patella bearing surface.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 1 wherein the cut away portions (43)
are formed by machining, forging, moulding or casting.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the meniscal
component (42) is guided on said tibial component for anterior-posterior sliding

movement.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 3 wherein the guidance of the
meniscal component (42) on the tibial component (72) is such as to permit a limited degree

of rotational movement of the meniscal component on the tibial component.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the meniscal component (42) is shaped to provide clearance for the patella bearing

surface (44) of the femoral component (41) in flexion. 
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the patella bearing surface (44) comprises a track (52) which is widened or shifted laterally

so as to prevent the patella (54) overhanging the lateral edge of the track.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the meniscal component (42) is shaped anteriorly to provide an intermediate surface

(45) between the tibial bearing surfaces (47) which is shallower than said tibial
bearing surfaces.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 7 wherein the meniscal component (42)
is shaped posteriorly so that the tibial bearing surfaces (47) merge into the

intermediate surface (45) without any discontinuity.
