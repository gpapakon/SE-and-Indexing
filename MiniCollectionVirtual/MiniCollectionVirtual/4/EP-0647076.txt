<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cellular radio communication system employed within a network of geographical cells traversed by mobile stations, the said system comprising means (11) for supplying a mobile station with at least one personalised service on the basis of information on the geographical location of the said mobile station. According to the invention, the system comprises:   - means (23) for recognising and branching off a first signalling message (22) transmitted between a base station subsystem and a switching and network subsystem; - means (26) for picking off the location information contained in the first branched-off signalling message, and - means of routing the said location information picked off towards the said means (11) for supplying at least one personalised service related to the location.
