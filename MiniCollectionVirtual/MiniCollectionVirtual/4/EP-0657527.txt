<ABSTRACT>
Granular laundry detergents are formulated with percarbonate 
bleach and oxidation-sensitive ingredients such as brighteners, enzymes, 

perfumes and the like. The storage stability of such compositions is 
improved by the presence of silicate. For example, the tendency of 

stilbene-type brighteners to form undesirable yellow shades in the 
presence of percarbonate is diminished by the incorporation of silicate 

materials into the granules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to granular detergent compositions
which contain a percarbonate bleach and one or more oxidation-sensitive
ingredients such as fluorescent whitening agents, enzymes,
perfumes, chelants, and the like. The compositions are formulated not
only to provide good detergency and bleaching performance, but also
to diminish or eliminate the oxidation of such ingredients during
storage of the compositions.The formulation of modern granular laundry detergents without
the use of phosphate builders and under various constraints with
respect to fabric safety and environmental effects is a substantial
challenge. The formulator is faced with the need to provide detergent
compositions which remove a wide variety of soils and stains from a
wide variety of fabrics. Detergent compositions must function
effectively over a wide range of wash temperatures. They must be
storage-stable over a wide range of temperatures and humidities.
Granular detergents should desirably be free-flowing and easily
dispensed in automatic equipment. They must not suds too much nor
too little. To be affordable, they must be formulated using
economical, yet safe and effective, ingredients. Accordingly, there
continues to be a substantial investment in the search for new and
improved detergent compositions.Inorganic bleaches such as percarbonate offer prospective
advantages to the detergent formulator due to their inherent cleaning
ability. Moreover, percarbonate bleaches offer prospective advantages
over the commonly-used perborate bleach, inasmuch as they do not
disadvantageously interact with important new surfactants such as the
polyhydroxy fatty acid amides. In addition, there is now some indication
that perborate bleach can sometimes undesirably complex with, and
stabilize, "polyol" stains, such as the polyphenolic materials found in
chocolate. Percarbonates do not suffer from this disadvantage.
Moreover, if properly formulated, especially as disclosed herein, 
percarbonate can provide superior dispensing properties as compared
with perborate.Another type of ingredient which is often incorporated into
granular laundry detergents comprises the fluorescent whitening agents,
more commonly referred to as "brighteners" or "optical bleaches". Such
agents do not, themselves, provide a true "bleaching" and stain removal
function, as does percarbonate. Rather, such agents are designed to
deposit onto fabrics, especially white fabrics, to subtly adjust the overall
visual perception from an undesirable "yellowish" shade to a
