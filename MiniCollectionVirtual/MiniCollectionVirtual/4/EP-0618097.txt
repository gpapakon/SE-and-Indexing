<ABSTRACT>
A telecontrol system for activating a supplementary vehicle heater with a precoded transmitter and a receiver allocated to a control device is specified, in which system transmitter or receiver can be coded in a self-training manner by the other device in each case. Transmitter or receiver can be switched to the training mode by switching a control input whilst the supplementary vehicle heater to be activated is switched off, and the receiver or the transmitter transmit their fixed precoding within a predetermined period to the other device in each case which stores the coding in a nonvolatile memory. The invention dispenses with the formation of fixed pairs of matching transistors and receivers which makes transportation and storage and spare part procurement difficult in conventional telecontrol systems.
