<CLAIMS>
Mobile X-ray apparatus, in which there are 
arranged on a wheeled carriage (1):
 
a control panel (2), a stand (3) and an X-ray source 

(5) mounted on the stand (3), wherein the stand (3) can 
be pivoted with the X-ray source (5) around a vertical 

axis (6) in relation to the wheeled carriage, 

characterised in that
 the control panel (2) and the 
stand (3) are secured to an assembly base plate (7) 

which is connected to the wheeled carriage (1) for 
rotation around a vertical axis, in such a way that 

approximately the same weight distributions always 
prevail, regardless of the pivoting range of the X-ray 

source (5) in each case.
