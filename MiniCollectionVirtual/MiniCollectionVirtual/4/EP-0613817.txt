<ABSTRACT>
The propeller (5) can be retracted behind the plane of the hull bottom into a shaft (8). When the propeller (4) is retracted into it, the shaft (8) can be closed lid-like in the plane of the hull bottom (1) by a plate (10). The shaft (8) can preferably be closed water-tight by the plate (10), the water trapped in the closed shaft can preferably be pumped out, and the shaft (8) pumped empty is preferably accessible through a manhole (18) in a top shaft cover (9) for inspection and maintenance work at the propeller (4), the manhole in turn being closable by a cover (19).

A ship propulsion system comprising a propeller 
(4) disposed under the ship's bottom (1), which is 

preferably substantially flat or flat in the region of 
the propulsion system, the propeller being retractable 

behind the plane of the ship's bottom into a shaft (8) 
which, when the propeller (4) has been retracted in the 

plane of the ship's bottom (1), can be closed by a 
cover in the form of a plate (10) adapted to be raised 

and lowered with the propeller, characterised in that 
the shaft (8) is closable in watertight manner by the 

plate (10) and a pump device (15) is provided for 
emptying the shaft after the plate (10) has been 

brought into the position where it closes the shaft 
like a cover. 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the bottom edge of the shaft (8) 

is surrounded by a pocket-like annular groove (20) 
which projects backwards relative to the shaft wall and 

the ship's bottom to an extent such that a sealing 
means (12) inserted in the annular groove has a sealing 

effect when the plate lies in the plane of the ship's 
bottom and abuts the sealing means, without the latter 

projecting into the shaft. 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the plate (10) is associated with 

a component (7) associated with the ship propulsion 
system in the region of the propeller (4), the 

propeller being rotatable relative to the component 
(7).  

 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the plate (10) is firmly and 

rigidly connected to the component (7). 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 3 or 
4, characterised in that the component is a nozzle (7) 

surrounding the propeller (4). 
A ship propulsion system according to any of 
claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the sealing means 

is an inflatable annular flexible tube (12). 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the tube seal (12) can be 

inflated with a hydraulic or pneumatic fluid and 
ventilated when not in use. 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the shaft (8) is closed from the 

ship's interior by a fixed cover (9) containing a 
closable manhole (18). 
A ship propulsion unit according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the shaft (8) closed by the plate 

(10) is filled with air through a valve (16) at the 
same rate as water is pumped from the closed shaft. 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the pump device (15) for emptying 

the shaft (8) is controlled by a sensor (17) in the 
region of the lower end of the shaft. 
A ship propulsion system according to any of 
claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the sealing means  

 
(12) is a closed ring comprising a closed hollow 

chamber profile (24). 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 11, 
characterised in that the hollow chamber profile (12) 

is held under prestress by a retaining strip (21) in 
the pocket-like annular groove in the shaft wall. 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the hollow chamber profile (24) 

is axially secured by a base strip (22) which abuts the 
base of the annular groove (20). 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 13, 
characterised in that the base strip (22) is disposed 

between the retaining strip (21) and a clip (23), the 
base strip, the retaining strip and the clip 

surrounding at least one connection for a flow medium 
between the interior of the hollow chamber profile (24) 

and a fluid pumping device (13, 14). 
A ship propulsion system according to claim 14, 
characterised in that when there are a number of 

connections for a flow medium they are connected to a 
common collecting duct (25) before being connected to 

the pump device (13, 14). 
A ship propulsion system according to any of 
claims 6 to 15, characterised in that the sealing 

means, which is in the form of a closed ring comprising 
a closed hollow chamber profile (24), is formed on its 

surface facing the plate (10) with a number of annular 
sealing lips (26) concentrically following one another 

in the diameter direction.
