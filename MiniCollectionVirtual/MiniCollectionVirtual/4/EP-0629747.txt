<ABSTRACT>
A universal breaking machine (3) is provided which comprising 
a pair of movable arms (5) pivotably connected to a support frame (4) for 

open-close movement, and a hydraulic cylinder (6) for causing the 
open-close movement of the pair of movable arms (5). The pair of 

movable arms (5) are adapted to secure detachably, at the opposite, 
forward end surfaces thereof, a set of or a pair of tool rests (8) 

for long cutter (12) having a long cutter thereon, tool rests for 
short cutter (9) having, at the rearward end thereof, a short cutter 

of a length smaller than that of the long cutter, and having a 
crusher at the forward end thereof, or smashing blocks having a 

plurality of large protrusions. A secondary breaking attachment 
having a plurality of small protrusions thereon may be removably 

attached, as desired, to the opposite, forward-most surfaces of 
the pair of movable arms. In a preferred embodiment, a first 

ring is removably attached to a pivot portion of the pair of 
movable arms (5), at which the movable arms (5) are attached to the 

support frame (4), on the surface opposite to the surface on which 
the cutter is to be attached. A second ring, confronting the 

first ring, is also removably attached to the support frame (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a universal breaking machine adapted to be
attached to a drive arm of a working machine, such as a power shovel, at the
forward end thereof for breaking or de-constructing buildings or the like of
reinforced concrete construction.In order to break constructions such as buildings or bridges made of
reinforced concrete, it is common to use a breaking machine or breaker which is
adapted to be attached to a forward end of a drive arm of a working machine,
such as a power shovel.It is noted that various operations, such as crushing of concrete
material, secondary crushing of such concrete material, and shearing of steel
bars or steel frames, are involved in de-construction work for constructions
such as buildings of reinforced concrete, or bridges.However, such operations cannot be performed by a single breaking
machine. Thus, according to the prior art, it is necessary to provide a plurality
of shearing machines or breaking machines suitable for the above mentioned
individual operations, for selective attachment to the tip of the drive arm of a
working machine, depending upon the particular operation. Such replacement
of breaking or crushing machines is time-consuming and inefficient, making de-construction
work inefficient and slow.The breaking machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure
No: 02(1990) - 232470, comprises a pair of movable arms pivotably attached
at the intermediate portions thereof, to a support frame, and a hydraulic cylinder
connected to the rearward end of each of the pair of movable arms. When the
hydraulic cylinder is actuated to be extended or retracted, the pair of movable
arms are closed or opened, clamping the material to be broken between the 
forward ends. The disclosed machine also permits a single working machine to
perform the various breaking operations by providing tool rests, detachably
secured to the movable arms, upon which cutting, crushing and/or smashing
attachments are selectively mountable.UK Patent Application No: 2 146 918 A teaches a breaking machine
with a rotative coupling means for allowing smooth rotation of the jaw members
and preventing excessive lateral loads.However, in the breaking machines known from the prior art, it is noted
that play or backlash may be created between the pair of movable arms after
prolonged use thereof, so that the steel bars or steel frames cannot be
sheared accurately.Such play results from abrasion or wear of the slide surface of the
movable arms, opposite to the surface on which the cutter is
