<ABSTRACT>
A combustion controller for a two-cycle engine which 
enables to cause self firing always at the optimum timi
ng is 
provided. The combustion controller comprises an exhaust 

control valve 15 provided in the vicinity of an exhaust port 
7 of the two-cycle engine 1 and capable of fully closing the 

exhaust port and driving control means 47, 38, 39, 40 and 37 
to drive the exhaust control valve 15 according to a control 

map giving an exhaust opening ratio ϑ
e
 depending at least on 
the engine speed and the throttle valve opening ratio ϑ
th
 in 
order to control the pressure in the cylinder during up-stroke 

of the piston 8. The exhaust control valve 15 is 
formed by a thin shell-like member comprising an exhaust 

control portion 35 substantially along the cylinder curvature 
in the exhaust port 7 and wider than the whole width of the 

exhaust port and a swinging arm portion 34 for connecting at 
least a side of the exhaust control portion and the 

rotational shaft 33 perpendicular to the cylinder axis and 
accommodated in a receiving recess formed in the cylinder 

block. This receiving recess is communicated with the 
exhaust passage extending from the exhaust port 7 only in the 

working zone of the exhaust control portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustion
controller for a spark ignition type two-cycle engine which
causes, at least for low load operation, combustion of the
fresh mixture in the combustion chamber by self firing, i.e.
active thermal atmosphere combustion.In a spark ignition type two-cycle engine in which an
exhaust port and a scavenging port opened and closed by a
piston are formed in an inner peripheral surface of a
cylinder hole, fresh mixture compressed in a crank chamber is
fed from the scavenging port into a cylinder chamber, and
burnt gas is discharged out of the exhaust port so that the
fresh mixture compressed in the cylinder chamber is fired by
means of an ignition plug, irregular combustion due to
accidental mis-firing often occurs under low to medium
load. This may result in abnormal engine vibration and
increased unburnt hydrocarbon content in the exhaust gas,
which leads to increased fuel consumption.To solve the above problem, active thermal atmosphere
combustion has been proposed. The active thermal atmosphere
combustion is a method to obtain a good combustion even under
a low load by activating the fresh mixture in the combustion
chamber with the thermal energy engine contained in the
residual gas of the previous cycle for much easier ignition
and causing self firing at the end of compressing.For example, Japanese Patent Publication No.
38766/1981 discloses a spark ignition type two-cycle engine
utilizing the above mentioned active thermal atmosphere
combustion. In this engine, fresh mixture is flowed at a
high speed in the scavenge passage so as to sufficiently
evaporate liquid fuel, and then, at a much lower speed, fed 
to the combustion chamber so as to generate radicals in the
gaseous phase at the area where fresh mixture makes contact
witn residual burnt gas in the combustion chamber.Further, document FR-A-25 15 260 discloses a two-cycle engine
utilizing an active thermal atmosphere combustion for low-load operation and
comprising the features according to the preamble of claim 1.The generated active thermal atmosphere is kept
until the end of the compression stroke for self firing
without an ignition plug. To maintain the active
thermal atmosphere status until the end of the compression
stroke, it is necessary to largely reduce disturbance and
flow of the residual burnt gas in the combustion chamber.
Accordingly, the exhaust passage is provided with an exhaust
control valve to prevent rapid discharge of the exhaust gas
from the exhaust port or exhaust pulsation
