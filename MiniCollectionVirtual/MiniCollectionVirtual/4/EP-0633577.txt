<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a charge-voltage converter comprising a readout diode (D) and a readout transistor (T2) having gain Go under zero load. The converter comprises additional circuits (4, T3) enabling it to provide a gain G greater than Go during the readout periods and substantially equal to zero outside these periods.

Charge-to-voltage converting device comprising a read
diode (D) across the terminals of which the voltage Vd

appears, and a read transistor (T2) having a no-load gain
Go and whose gate is connected to said read diode in such

a way that said voltage Vd is applied to said gate, and
whose source is the point (A) at which the output voltage

Vs of said device is collected, said conversion being
carried out in three time intervals, a first interval (tl)

during which the capacitance (Cd) of the diode (D) is precharged,
a second interval (t2) during which the diode is

at a floating potential, and a third interval (t3) during
which the signal resulting from the charge-to-voltage

conversion is read, characterised in that said device
includes an amplifier (4) providing a controlled gain K,

and a transistor (T3) connected as an inverter and
providing a no-load gain equal to -G1, said amplifier

providing gain K having its input connected to the point
(A) at which the output voltage Vs is collected and its

output connected to the gate of the transistor (T3)
connected as an inverter, this transistor having its drain

connected to the amplifier providing gain K and its source
being earthed in such a way that the gain G is given by

the equation:

G = 
Go
1 + G1K
,

   the amplifier providing gain K being associated with
gain control circuits enabling the gain K to assume a

negative value during the second and third intervals (t2,
t3), so that the gain G becomes greater than Go, and a

positive value during the first interval (tl) so that the
gain G becomes substantially equal to zero during this

first interval. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the read transistor (T2) and the transistor connected as

an inverter (T3) are MOS transistors.
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that
the read transistor (T2) and the transistor connected as

an inverter (T3) are identical, such that G
1
 is equal to
Go.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that Go
is substantially equal to 0.85, K is substantially equal

to -0.2 during the second and third intervals (t2, t3),
and substantially equal to 10 during the first interval

(t1).
Charge transfer device, characterised in that it
includes a device according to any of the preceding

claims.
