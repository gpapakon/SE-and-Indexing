<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to prepare a calcium hydrogen phosphate that has 
excellent binding properties, a large oil adsorption capacity and a specific surface area, and is 

therefore suitable as an excipient. 
A scale-like calcium hydrogen phosphate is prepared by reacting phosphoric acid with an 
alkaline calcium compound such as quick lime, in the presence of a multivalent organic acid with 

coordinating ability, such as citric acid, to obtain a columnar calcium hydrogen phosphate, and then 
hydrothermally treating the obtained columnar calcium hydrogen phosphate at a temperature of 

60° C or higher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a calcium hydrogen phosphate for use in such items as
medicines, cosmetics, and foods, as well as a method for preparing the calcium hydrogen
phosphate and an excipient utilizing it.Calcium hydrogen phosphate is used in such items as pharmaceuticals and foods to reinforce
calcium and phosphoric acid components and as an anti-caking agent.Since calcium hydrogen phosphate is non-hygroscopic, inert, non-reactive
with medicines,
and does not discolor formulations, attempts have been made to utilize it as an excipient for such
items as medicines, cosmetics, and foods. However, since calcium hydrogen phosphate takes the
form of sheet-like crystalline granules of 10 µm or more and thereofore features inferior binding
properties, it is unsuitabe in this form as an exipient. In order
to avoid this drawback, calcium hydrogen
phosphate is conventionally pulverized into fine granules or combined with a binding agent such as
sodium polyacrylate to give it molding properties.Fig. 1 is a scanning electron micrograph of Example 1.Fig. 2 is a scanning electron micrograph of Comparative Example 1.Fig. 3 is a scanning electron micrograph of Example 6.None of the methods conventionally employed have been sufficiently effective, thus far
failing to give clacium hydrogen phosphate satisfactory properties as an excipient.The present invention has been made taking the above circumstances into consideration,
and the object of the present invention is to provide a calcium hydrogen phosphate with excellent 
binding properties that can also be easily used as an excipient in such items as medicines and
foods, as well as a method for preparing such a calcium hydrogen phosphate. Another object of
the present invention is to provide an excipient utilizing a calcium hydrogen phosphate.In attempt to achieve the above objects, the present inventors have made various
investigations based on the new technology claimed in Japanese Patent Application No.5-98473.
The present inventors have succeeded in obtaining a scale-like calcium hydrogen phosphate that
is ideal as an excipient by hydrothermally treating the columnar calcium hydrogen phosphate
produced by the joint use of a multivalent organic acid described in the above-mentioned
patent
application. The calcium hydrogen phosphate obtained has small crystalline particles, a large
apparent specific volume, a large specific area, and features excellent oil absorption ability.Furthermore, the calcium hydrogen phosphate with the above properties can easily be
