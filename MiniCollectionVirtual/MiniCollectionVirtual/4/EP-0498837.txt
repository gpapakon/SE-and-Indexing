<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bicycle or cycle-type 
machine, specifically to an apparatus enabling positioning 
change capabilities of the bicycle's or cycle-type machine's 
seat, controllable by a bicycle rider while riding the bicycle 
or an operator while operating the cycle-type machine. The conventional static adjustment capabilities of bicycle 
seats in the horizontal, vertical, and angular directions 
is well known and old in the prior art. A modification 
which is now well known incorporates a coil sprung seat post 
with a quick release clamp, used primarily in mountain bike 
racing, enabling adjusting of the seat up or down, while riding, 
in order to provide for lower center of gravity and 
more stable bike handling on fast descents. Patent 4,772,069 to Szymski, 9-20-88, shows a multi-position 
horizontal, vertical, and angular seat adjustment 
capability. Patent 3,302,970 to Rizzato, 2-7-67, shows a 
releasably lockable hinged seat post and separate arcuate 
rack device for the purpose of, as stated, to maintain horizontal  
 
orientation of the seat whatever the saddle holder 
position may be. Patent 3,861,740 to Tajima, Yasuda, and 
Seki, 1-21-75, shows a telescoping hydraulic oil cylinder 
apparatus for vertical seat adjustment capabilities. Each of the three documents DK-C-56046, GB-A-915,594 
and FR-A-1,452,133 discloses a seat position changing apparatus 
mainly comprising a linked parallelogram base support structure 
for the seat. Said parallelogram merely permits the seat to be 
moved downwaldly or upwardly while strictly keeping the same 
parallel direction. These references require separate and different uni-directional 
seat movement effectuating steps in order to realize 
a multi-directional seat position change end result. 
Taken either singly, or in combination, these references do 
not appear to suggest, anticipate, or teach towards what this 
invention can embody, namely, an apparatus enabling a combined 
multi-directional seat position changing capability, 
within a plurality of releasably locked positions, particularly 
with regards to its comprising an exclusively single 
common releasable locking mechanism, connected by cable to a 
handlebar mounted exclusively single common actuating control, 
controllable by the rider while riding or the operator 
while operating. This way the rider, or operator, has but 
one, identically repeatable, controlling actuation to contend 
with which enables desirable multi-directional seat position 
changes to be effected, the need for, and

<CLAIMS>
A seat position changing apparatus for a bicycle or cycle 
type machine, controllable by a rider while riding the 

bicycle or an operator operating the cycle-type machine, 
comprising : 


a seat (72, 79, 81) ; 
a lower bar member (34R, 34L) ; 
a front supporting means (88) pivotally connected between a front 
portion (86) of said seat and said lower bar member (34R, 

34L) ; 
a rear supporting means (62R, 62L) pivotally connected between a 
rear portion (76) of said seat and said lower bar member 

(34R, 34L) ; 
connecting means connecting said lower bar member (34R, 
34L) to a cycle frame, said connecting means comprising a 

clamp (32) provided at an intermediate portion of said 
lower bar member (34R, 34L) ; 
said clamp being connected to a seat post (30) extending upwardly 
from the cycle frame ; 
biasing means (104) for biasing said supporting means (88, 
62R, 62L) to move said seat in a generally forward direction 

relative to said lower bar member (34R, 34L) ; 
a releasable locking means (37) preventing movement of said 
supporting means (88, 62R, 62L) relative to said lower bar 

member ; 
actuating control means (106) for unlocking said locking 
means ;
 
characterized in that
 
when viewed from a side elevation said rear supporting means 

(62R, 62L) provide arcuately greater movement than said front 
supporting means (88) and are arranged such that when said 

supporting means are in the forwardmost position said seat 

(72, 79, 81) is tilted downwardly and forwardly. 
The apparatus of claim 1, characterized in that the inter-connecting 
means (38, 40) connecting the rearward portion (76) 

of the seat (72) and the rearward portion of the bar type 
members (34R, 34L) include a cylinder (38) transversely 

affixed to the rearward portion of the bar type members (34R, 
34L) with a drum 40 rotatably engaged about the cylinder (38) 

and interconnected to the rearward portion (76) of the seat 
(72). 
The apparatus of claim 2, characterized in that the lower 
bar member comprises two bar type members (34R, 34L) which 

are essentially parallel to each other at their generally 
rearward end areas, and are fitted into receiving holes that 

the cylinder (38) has, said holes being located near either 
end of the cylinder (38). 
The apparatus of claim 2, characterized in that the drum (40) 
is approximately the same length as the cylinder (38), said 

drum having slots (58R, 58L) near either end to provide 
clearance for the bar type members (34R, 34L) and rotational 

range limits for the drum (40). 
The apparatus of claim 2, characterized in that the rear 
suporting means between the drum (40) and the rearward 

portion (76) of the seat (72) include arm type members (62R, 
62L), affixed at substantially either end of the drum (40), 

being intermittently movably spatially oriented relative to, 
and effectively affixed to, the rearward portion (76) of 

the seat (72). 
The apparatus of claim 2, characterized in that the cylinder 
(38) further comprises a sleeve (42) inserted into a bore 

placed perpendicularly to, and at the approximate center of, 
said cylinder (38). 
The apparatus claim 6, characterized in that the sleeve (42) 
further comprises a locking pin (44) slidably engageable into 

any one of a plurality of receiving cavities (54F, 54B) 
that the drum (40) has.  

 
The apparatus of claim 7, characterized in that the drum 
(40) further comprises a slot (56) at its approximate center 

to provide clearance for a portion of the sleeve (42) that 
protrudes from the cylinder (38). 
The apparatus of claim 1, characterized in that the clamp 
(32), including any member clampable therewith, remains 

immovably spatially oriented relative to the seat post (30) 
during the intermittent seat repositioning effectuations 

while riding.
