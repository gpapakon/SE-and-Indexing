<ABSTRACT>
A diamond-bearing assembly comprises opposed diamond-bearing 
surfaces (10, 12), at least one of which is free of any Group VIII metals 

such as cobalt. Preferably, each of the surfaces (10, 12) is provided by 
a surface of a diamond compact (14, 16), such diamond compact 

containing substantial diamond-to-diamond bonding, and a second phase 

which contains silicon in the form of silicon and/or silicon carbide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bearing assemblies.Diamond-bearing assemblies are known and are used in various
applications. One application of a diamond-bearing assembly is a
downhole motor used in the drilling industry.In diamond-bearing assemblies, e.g. known from JP-A-63 106 420 and US-A- 4 620 601, the opposed bearing surfaces of the
assembly are both made of a diamond material. The diamond material
is polycrystalline diamond or PCD. This diamond material is also known
in the art as a diamond compact. Such material is used because of its
long wearing life and its ability to carry substantial loads. The
polycrystalline diamond which has been used for diamond-bearing
assemblies is that known in the art as Syndite®, Syndrill® or Stratapax®.
This polycrystalline diamond material contains substantial amounts of
Group VIII metals such as cobalt, iron or nickel. Reference in this
regard may be made to US-A- 4 620 601, column 12
lines 30 to 37, and US-A- 4 560 014, column 9 lines
29 to 44. US-A-5 092 687 describes diamond-bearing assemblies
having opposed diamond-bearing surfaces. The diamond-bearing
surfaces are provided by cemented tungsten carbide in which synthetic
diamonds are bonded - column 3 lines 49 to 51. Cemented tungsten
carbide has a Group VIII metal such as cobalt, nickel or iron as its
binder.It has been found that where a diamond-bearing assembly utilises a
diamond material containing a Group VIII metal, as in the references
described above, the friction behaviour of the contacting-bearing surfaces
tends to become quite unpredictable during high contact pressures. In
some cases, rapid seizure of the bearing assembly occurs without
adequate warning. This phenomenon is believed to be caused by a
Group VIII-rich tribofilm which forms on the diamond surfaces during
use of the bearing assembly.According to the present invention, a bearing assembly comprises
opposed diamond bearing surfaces, both of which are free of any
Group VIII metal.The term "free of any Group VIII metal" means that
there will be substantially no Group VIII metal in that surface, although
trace amounts of Group VIII metals may be present without resulting in
a deleterious effect. Group VIII metals include cobalt, iron and nickel. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate diagrammatic sectional views of opposed
diamond-bearing surfaces of two embodiments of bearing assemblies of
the invention.The invention provides a bearing assembly comprising opposed diamond
bearing surfaces. The bearing assembly may be any known in the art.
The invention has
