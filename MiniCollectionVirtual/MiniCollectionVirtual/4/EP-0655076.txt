<ABSTRACT>
A process for the copolymerization of (1) a carboxylic acid comprising terephthalic acid and mixtures thereof with isophthalic acid with (2) a mixture of hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene diamine. The pressure in the polymerization process is maintained at at least about 2.15 MPa for a period of at least about 40 minutes so that the resultant copolyamide, when annealed, has less than 1 % by weight based on the total weight of the copolyamide of fractions having melting points greater than 320  DEG C. Use of lower pressures and times tends to result in formation of a high melting fraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of multiple consecutive batches of a
copolyamide of terephthalic acid and an aliphatic diamine
especially to the preparation of such a copolyamide without
formation of a high melting fraction by using a high pressure
polymerization process.As used herein, a "single step" polymerization process is
a polymerization process in which monomers are subjected to a
polymerization cycle in a reactor that concludes with the
pressure being returned to substantially atmospheric pressure.
It is understood that the copolyamide obtained from such a
process may be subjected to further processing, including
finishing and extrusion, before or after pelletization.Single-step polymerization processes have the advantage
that polymer is manufactured in a single step, as opposed to
two step or multi-step processes, thereby reducing handling of
the partially formed polymer during the intermediate stages of
the process. However, in the manufacture of copolyamides of
terephthalic acid, especially copolyamides of terephthalic
acid, hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene
diamine, using a single step polymerization process, it has
been found that a high melting fraction is formed.The high melting fraction, with a melting point in excess
of 320°C and especially approximately 334°C, is usually not
noticed in the first batch of polymer produced in an
autoclave, but becomes apparent in subsequent batches made in
the same autoclave unless steps are taken to carefully clean-out
the autoclave between consecutive batches. As the polymer
would normally be subsequently processed at melt temperatures
of less than 320°C, the high melting fraction manifests itself
as unmelted or gel-like portions of polymer, which are
commercially unacceptable; the gel-like portions are believed
to be essentially comprised of a high melting crystalline
phase, which is soluble in sulphuric acid, and not gel per se
which would not be soluble in sulphuric acid. WO-A 92/10525 describes a process for the preparation
of a copolyamide from inter alia terephthalic acid and
a mixture of hexamethylene diamine and 2-methyl pentamethylene
diamine by heating the aqueous salt solution under
pressure until the pressure in the reactor reaches at least
1300 kPa, water and other volatile matter being vented from
the reactor, reducing the pressure in the reactor to
atmospheric pressure over a period of at least 15 minutes
when the temperature of the reaction mixture has reached a
temperature of at least

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of multiple
consecutive batches of a copolyamide of terephthalic acid and

an aliphatic diamine in a reactor without clean-out of the
reactor, said process comprising the stages of


(a) feeding to a reactor an aqueous salt solution of
an admixture of terephthalic acid and aliphatic diamine, said

aliphatic diamine being a mixture of hexamethylene diamine and
2-methyl pentamethylene diamine;
(b) heating the aqueous salt solution under a pressure
of at least 2.28 MPa and at a temperature in the range of 300-315°C

and maintaining that pressure for a time period of from
at least 60 minutes, while venting water and other volatile

matter from the reactor;
(c) reducing the pressure in the reactor to
atmospheric pressure;
(d) controlling stages (b) and (c) so as to avoid
excessive foaming of the admixture in the reactor; and
(e) discharging the copolyamide so obtained from the
reactor; and
(f) repeating these stages as required.
The process of Claim 1, in which the copolyamide
obtained from such process contains not more than about 2% by

weight of a fraction with an annealed melting point of greater
than 320°C.
The process of Claims 1 or 2 in which the time
period in stage (b) is at least about 90 minutes.
The process of any one of Claims 1-3 in which
stage (c) additionally includes maintaining the admixture in

the reactor under a vacuum. 
The process of any one of Claims 1-3 in which the
stages of the process are controlled so that the copolyamide

produced has an inherent viscosity of at least about 0.6 dL/g.
The process of any one of Claims 1-3 in which the
stages of the process are controlled so that the copolyamide

produced has an inherent viscosity of at least about 0.8 dL/g.
The process of any one of Claims 1-6 in which the
copolyamide is a partially crystalline copolyamide.
