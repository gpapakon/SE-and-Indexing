<ABSTRACT>
Articulated bus, in particular of the type with a low 
floor, whereby said bus has a pulling vehicle (1), a 

pulled vehicle (2) and an articulated mechanism which 
connects both vehicles to one another and which contains 

a rotary junction (3) with a lower part (13) which is 
connected to the pulling vehicle (1) and an upper part 

(14) mounted thereupon in a rotating manner around an 
upward axis of rotation to which the pulled vehicle (2) 

is connected, whereby the connection between either of 
these parts (13 and 14) of the rotary junction (3) and 

the accompanying vehicle (1 or 2) is a hinged joint (20, 
22 to 27) with an axis which is diagonal to the rotary 

shaft of the rotary junction (3), characterized in that 
the hinged joint between a vehicle (1 or 2) and either of 

the parts (13 or 14) of the rotary junction (3) contains 
two flexible supporting arms (18), which are situated on 

either side of the rotary shaft of the rotary junction 
(3), and which are each fixed to an end of the vehicle (1 

or 3) on the one hand, and which are connected in a 
hinged manner to the part (13 or 14) of the rotary 

junction (3) on the other hand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an articulated bus, in 
particular of the type with a low floor, whereby said bus 
has a pulling vehicle, a pulled vehicle and an 
articulated mechanism which connects both vehicles to one 
another and which contains a rotary junction with a lower 
part which is connected to the pulling vehicle and an 
upper part mounted thereupon in a rotating manner around 
an upward axis of rotation to which the pulled vehicle is 
connected, whereby the connection between either of these 
parts of the rotary junction and the accompanying vehicle 
is a hinged joint with an axis which 
is substantially coplanar with the 
rotary junction and transverse regarding the longitudinal axis 
of the vehicle. In known articulated buses of the above-mentioned type, 
the hinged joint between one of the vehicles and one of 
the parts of the rotary junction consists of a rigid 
structure which forms a whole with the vehicle frame and 
which is connected in a hinged manner with two protruding 
parts on either side of the rotary shaft to the above-mentioned 
part of the rotary junction. Such buses are 
described among others in patents BE-A-872.030 and NL-A-78 
11 557. When the bus drives on a bumpy road, with two road 
surfaces which are turned in relation to one another, 
large torques will arise at the height of the articulated 
mechanism in the structures of the vehicles with such a 
hinged joint. Theme torques, which may be very large,  
 
can be absorbed in an articulated bus with an ordinary 
high floor, since there is enough room to make the 
vehicle frames sufficiently strong. In articulated buses 
with low floors, however, the structural height of the 
frame or chassis is too limited to absorb such possible 
torques. The invention aims to provide an articulated bus whereby 
torques in the frames at the height of the articulated 
mechanism are restricted or avoided, such that it is not 
necessary to make the frame of the vehicles heavier to 
this aim, and whereby the hinged joint can be made very 
simple and especially very compact, all this such that, 
if required, the floor height of the articulated bus can 
be kept relatively low without any problems. This aim is realized according to the invention as the 
hinged joint between a vehicle and either of the parts of 
the rotary junction contains two flexible supporting 
arms, which are situated on either side of the rotary 
shaft of the rotary junction, and which are each fixed to 
an end of the vehicle on the one hand, and which are 
connected
