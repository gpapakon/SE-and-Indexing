<ABSTRACT>
Processes are provided for making polycarbodiimides with high carbodiimide contents from isocyanates, and for selectively making mixed aryl-tertiary carbodiimides from isocyanates. Also provided are carbodiimides containing alpha-methylstyryl groups, and polymers made therefrom. All of these polymers and compounds are useful in coatings, and for other applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a process for selectively 
making tertiary-aryl carbodiimides. Carbodiimides are known in the art, and generalized 
processes for making them from isocyanates are also 
known. It is also known in general that these processes 
are catalyzed by certain compounds, particularly 
selected phosphorous and arsenic compounds. However, 
these processes often have drawbacks, such as the 
inability to control the products obtained when more 
than one isocyanate is used, and particularly for 
polymeric carbodiimides, the ability to produce polymers 
with high carbodiimide contents. U.S. Patent 4,137,386 discloses the preparation of 
polystyrene polymers containing dihydrocarbyl arsyl 
oxide radicals attached to the polymer chain. These 
polymers are reported to be catalysts for the conversion 
of organic isocyanates to carbodiimides. A useful review of polycarbodiimides is K. Wagner, 
et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., vol. 20, 819-830 
(1981). Certain carbodiimides and their preparation involving the reaction of a phosphoramide with a certain isocyanate is disclosed in US-A-5 105 010. Sandler, Karo: Organic Functional Group 
Preparations, Vol. II, 207-208 (1971) generally 
describes the preparation of carbodiimides using a 
catalytic dimerization of isocyanates. The catalyst can be a Group VB or Group VIB oxide. The invention provides a process for the 
preparation of tertiary-aryl carbodiimides, comprising, 
contacting a tertiary isocyanate, an aryl isocyanate, 
and a catalyst for the condensation of isocyanates to 
carbodiimides, at a sufficiently high temperature and 
for a sufficient amount of time to convert the 
isocyanates to carbodiimide. This invention also concerns a process for making 
polymeric carbodiimides, comprising, contacting one or 
more diisocyanates with a triarylarsine oxide, at a 
sufficiently high temperature and for a sufficient 
amount of time to react of 90% or more of the original 
isocyanate groups, and provided that the total of  
 
primary and secondary isocyanate groups present is at 
least 10% of the total isocyanate groups present. Disclosed herein is a process for the 
production of tertiary-aryl carbodiimides from tertiary 
and aryl isocyanates. Throughout this Application, the 
following terms are used:  
 
tertiary isocyanate or carbodiimide - An 
isocyanate in which the nitrogen atom is bound to a 
tertiary (cyclo)alkyl carbon atom (a carbon atom bound 
to three other carbon atoms), or a carbodiimide in which 
one of the nitrogen atoms of the
