 COMPOSITION CONTAINING LACTONE AND ESTER FOR REMOVING COATINGSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to removing paint and/or coatings. In particular, this invention relates to compositions for removing paint and/or coatings.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is often desirable to remove deposits from a substrate in order to clean the substrate. For example, U.K. Patent No. 2,172,304 (Tsu ada) discloses a composition used to remove thermoplastic resins and residues such as acetal and thermoplastic polyesters resins. Generally, acetal and thermoplastic polyester resins are used as materials in molding processes such as injection molding to form objects such as steam iron housings, automotive electrical switches and television cathode-ray tube sockets. Tsukada's preferred composition comprises a β-, γ- or δ- lactone mixed with an alcohol. Tsukada also mentions that the lactones can be mixed with an ester, in particular ethyl acetate, instead of an alcohol.In addition for the need to remove acetal and thermoplastic polyesters resins and their residues, there is a need to remove paints and/or coatings from a substrate for a variety of reasons such as repainting or refiniehing the substrate. Paints and/or coatings include conventional paints, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, water emulsion finishes and non-aqueous dispersions. The term "coating" hereinafter applies to both paints and coatings. Coatings can be removed in a number of different ways. For example, they can be physically removed by use of a scraper or power sander or they can be chemically removed. However, methods utilizing chemical compositions have achieved considerable popularity because they are much easier to use than the non- chemical alternatives. The chemical compositions used to remove coatings broadly fall within three general classes: (1) the alkali or acid class, (2) the organic solvent class and (3) the waterbased class. The first class generally comprises alkalis or acids which attack the coating by the chemical action of the ingredients thereof. Representative examples of this class are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,681,250, 3,615,825 and 3,972,839. These alkali or acid compositions are undesirable because they often exhibit deleterious effects on wood or because they require considerable after treatment to insure the compositions complete removal from 

 the treated surface.The second class of chemical compositions used to remove coatings generally comprises solvent based compositions which rely upon the solvent power of the

<CLAIMS>
I Claim:
1. A composition for removing coatings comprising: a. at least one lactone; and b. at least one ester wherein said ester is not ethyl acetate.
2. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said lactone is selected from the group comprising β-lactones, γ-lactones, δ- lactones, ε-lactones and mixtures thereof.
3. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said ester is selected from the group comprising aliphatic esters, aromatic esters and mixtures thereof.
4. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition includes at least one aromatic solvent.
5. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition further includes water.
6. The composition of Claim 5 wherein said composition further includes at least one aromatic solvent.
7. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition further includes at least one thickener.
8. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition further includes at least one additive.
9. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition further includes at least one surfactant.
10. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition further includes at least one solvent.
11. The composition of Claim 1 comprising from about 10 to about 90 parts by weight lactone and from about 90 to about 10 parts by weight ester.
12. The composition of Claim 5 comprising from about 10 to about 40 parts by weight lactone, from about 30 to about 80 parts by weight ester and from about 0 to about 50 parts by weight water. 


 13. A method of removing a coating from a substrate comprising the steps of: a. applying to a substrate a composition comprising at least one lactone and at least one ester; b. allowing said composition to penetrate said substrate; and c. removing said coating from said substrate.
14. The method of Claim 13 wherein said lactone is selected from the group comprising β-lactones, γ-lactones, δ- lactones, ε-lactones and mixtures thereof.
15. The method of Claim 13 wherein said ester is selected from the group comprising aliphatic esters, aromatic esters and mixtures thereof.
16. The method of Claim 13 wherein said composition includes at least one aromatic solvent.
17. The method of Claim 13 wherein said composition includes water.
18. The method of Claim 17 wherein said composition further includes at least one aromatic solvent.
19. The method of Claim 13 wherein said composition further includes at least one thickener.
20. The method of Claim 13 wherein said composition includes at least one additive.
21. The method of Claim 13 wherein said composition includes at least one surfactant.
22. The method of Claim 13 wherein said composition includes at least one solvent.
23. The method of Claim 13 comprising from about 10 to about 90 parts by weight lactone and from about 90 to about 10 parts by weight ester. 


 24. The method of Claim 17 comprising from about 10 to about 40 parts by weight lactone, from about 30 to about 80 parts by weight ester and from about 0 to about 50 parts by weight water.
