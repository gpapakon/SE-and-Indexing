<ABSTRACT>
A technique is provided for processing a decoded image signal (S10) having 
distortion and obtained by decoding coded data by utilizing a two-dimensional inverse 

orthogonal transformation, the coded data having been obtained by coding an image 
signal by utilizing a two-dimensional orthogonal transformation. The technique 

constructs (10) at least one correction block each including a plurality of pixels from 
a plurality of coded blocks from the decoded image signal and having a distortion on 

at least one boundary therebetween. The coded blocks of each correction block are 
adjacent to one another. A two-dimensional orthogonal transformation of each 

correction block is performed (11) by utilizing a Haar function so as to form 
coefficients including higher-order side coefficients (404), lower-order side 

coefficients (403) and a dc coefficient (402). A correction value is added to the 
higher-order side coefficients in accordance with a predetermined number of the 

lower-order side coefficients when the predetermined number of the lower-order side 
coefficients has values other than zero so as to form a correction coefficient signal for 

each correction block. A two-dimensional inverse orthogonal transformation (15) is 
performed on the correction coefficient signal of each correction block by utilizing the 

Haar function so as to obtain a smoothed image signal in which each distortion on 
each boundary of the coded blocks has been smoothed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image signal processing and is applicable, for
example, in image transmission to a remote location using a transmitting medium
having a limited transmission capacity or in digital recording and reproducing of an
image on a video recording device (such as a tape recorder or video disk recorder)
having a limited capacity.In systems transmitting an image signal to a remote location, such as a video
conference system, the amount of information transmitted may be reduced by
efficiently coding significant information by utilizing the correlation between image
signals. As a result, the transmission efficiency is enhanced. Similarly, in an
apparatus for digitizing an image signal and for recording and reproducing such
digitized signal on a video tape recorder or video disk recorder or the like, the amount
of record information may be reduced by efficiently coding significant information by
utilizing the correlation between digitized image signals, thereby enhancing the
recording 
efficiency. Accordingly, in these situations, the transmission
path and the recording medium are effectively utilized.The above-mentioned coding may be performed by
utilizing a block orthogonal transformation coding method, such
as a discrete cosine transform (DCT). Figs. 16 and 17
respectively illustrate an image coding apparatus 149 and an
image decoding apparatus 159 which utilize a block orthogonal
transformation coding method such as DCT and an inverse thereof.
Each such apparatus will now be described.In the image coding apparatus 149 of Fig. 16, an input
image signal S140, which may be a scanning signal, is supplied to
a blocking circuit 140. The blocking circuit 140 transforms the
received signal into a blocked image signal S141 representing
blocks of 8 x 8 pixels. An 8 X 8 block is utilized herein as a
transformation unit. The blocked image signal S141 is supplied
to an orthogonal transformation circuit 141 which transforms the
received blocked image signal into a plurality of coefficients
S142 for each coded block. Each such coefficient S142 is
supplied to a quantization circuit 142 so as to be quantized with
accuracy corresponding to the location of each coefficient within
the coded block and supplied therefrom as a quantized coefficient
S143.It is to be noted that when the visual capabilities and
the like of a human being are considered, a lower-order side
coefficient including many components of a low region which is of 
significant importance in constructing an image is quantized with
