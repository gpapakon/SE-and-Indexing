Automated coffee machine, especially for making single cups 
and pots of coffee, the coffee machine including a casing (1), 

a flow heater (2) for providing hot water disposed within the 
casing, a brewing device (5) preferably disposed within the flow 

heater (2), and at least one means for providing ground coffee, 
the brewing device (5) including a brewing chamber (6), formed 

from a stationary arranged pipe section (4) with a vertical axis 
(9), two stoppers (7, 8), an axial drive for moving the upper 

stopper (7) on a turning am (29) in a heating position into and 
out of the pipe section (4), a pivot drive for moving the upper 

stopper (7) into a parking position away from the axis (9) of 
the pipe section (4) and into a stand-by position in the axis 

(9) of the pipe section, a vertical drive for the lower stopper 
(8), and a driven swivel wiper (32) for the removal of a tablet 

of coffee grounds, 
wherein
 the upper stopper (7) is solidly 
attached to the turning am (29), that a single motor (10) with 

a following power divider (16) is provided for the axial drive 
and for the pivot drive of the turning am (29) with the upper 

stopper (7) as well as the drive of the swivel wiper (32), that 
the power divider (16) has a stroke-like driven pivot column 

(15), an axially secured guide bushing (17), and a stationary 
grooved bushing (18), and that the guide bushing (17) and the 

grooved bushing (18) each have a guiding slot (27, 23) for a 
crosshead (28), which is connected to the pivot column (15). 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the 
motor (10) is arranged below the flow heater (2) and that the 

power divider (16) passes through the casing (1) of the flow 
heater (2).  

 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 
the power divider (16) is formed so that during the motion of 

the upper stopper (7) from the stand-by position to the parking 
position the swivel wiper (32) simultaneously removes the tablet 

of coffee grounds. 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 3, 
wherein
 the 
first gli
ding slot (23) in the grooved bushing (18) has an 
axially parallel starting region (24) for bringing the upper 

stopper (7) from the heating position to the stand-by position 
and a thread-like ascending region (25) for pivoting the turning 

arm (29) with the upper stopper (7) from the stand-by position 
to the parking position. 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 3 and 4, 
wherein
 
the second gliding slot (27) is arranged axially parallel in the 

guide bushing (17). 
Automated coffee machine according to one of the claims 1 to 
5, 
wherein
 the turning arm (29) is elongated surpassing the 
pivot column (15) on its side facing away from the upper stopper 

(7) and has a stop (30), that a counterstop (31) allocated to 
the stop (30) is provided on the casing (1) of the flow heater 

(2), the stop (30) of the turning arm (29) being supported on 
said counterstop (31) in the heating position of the upper 

stopper (7). 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 1 or 3, 
wherein
 
the swivel wiper (32) is connected to the guide bushing (17) in 

a non-turnable way. 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the 
motor (10) for driving the pivot column (15) is an electric 

motor, especially a d.c. motor, and that a worm gear (11) and a 
nut/spindle-unit is provided in between the motor (10) and the  

 
power divider (16), in which the spindle (12) is connected to 

the pivot column (15) in a non-turnable way. 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the 
motor (33) for moving the lower stopper (8) is an electric 

motor, especially a d.c. motor. 
Automated coffee machine according to claim 4, 
wherein
 the 
gliding slot (23) in the grooved bushing (18) has an axially 

parallel end section (26).
