<ABSTRACT>
A body support for a baby or young child comprises a pair of bolsters (1 and 2) in cases (10) joined together by connector means (3) whose effective length can be adjusted. The bolsters thus provide a channel of adjustable width in which the baby or young child can be supported without the baby or young child causing the length to change from its adjusted value. The bolsters (1, 2) may be removed from their cases (10) for cleaning.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a body support which enables 
a baby or young child to sleep safely on its side. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or "cot death" as it 
is commonly known, has been acknowledged for many years. 
The causes of SIDS are mostly unexplained and the 
associated risk factors have still to be defined. 
However, the medical professions generally agree that 
one of the likely contributory factors to SIDS is the 
bedding and sleeping position of the young baby. Parents are often concerned as to what is the best 
position for laying down a sleeping baby. A baby 
sleeping on its back faces the risk of choking on its 
vomit. A baby lying on its front can inhale dangerous 
toxic gases created by fungus development on the cover 
of the cot mattress. A baby sleeping on its side would 
be less susceptible to such unnecessary risks. The 
present invention sets out to provide a device which 
serves to position a baby comfortably and securely upon 
its side. Although parents may lay their babies in the desired 
side position, it has been found that only 30 per cent 
such babies remain in that position and many move to a 
prone position with their face downwards and such babies 
face a higher risk of cot death. Many parents use rolled-up towels or blankets, one for 
the front and one for the back, to keep their babies in 
the side position. Spontaneous movements by babies 
including stretching and kicking may lead to the front  
 
rolled-up towel to end up partially or completely 
covering the baby's head, leading to overheating and 
possibly suffocation. Pillows used in place of towels 
or blankets are an improvement. US-A-2,765,480 discloses an all purpose orthopedic 
pillow comprising a pair of equal size pillows with a 
connecting band with snap fasteners for detachably 
connecting one or both pillows to the band. These snap 
fasteners allow the pillow to be used for various 
purposes with one or both of the sets of snap fasteners 
engaged. This type of snap fastener only allows a 
pillow case to be secured completely to the band or to 
be not secured to the band and there is no adjustment of 
the proportion of the band which is secured to the 
adjacent pillow case. The present invention relates to a body support 
for a young child or baby comprising a pair of bolster 
cases permanently interconnected by means of a length of 
flexible connector means, a bolster in each case and 
means for adjusting the effective length of the 
connector means between one bolster case and the other.
