<ABSTRACT>
The process for manufacturing plastic articles comprises a step of continuous extrusion of a plastic at at least one movable or fixed extrusion unit. The said process furthermore comprises:   - an intermediate distribution step constituted, on the one hand, by a preforming operation so as to obtain a preform (10) around an elongate core (7) and moving with respect to the said extrusion unit (12) and, on the other hand, by bringing the said preform (10) into position in line with at least one pressing unit (11), the said preform (10) being supported by the said core (7), and - a step of sequential pressing of the said preform (10) at the said pressing unit (11), the said pressing unit (11) being movable or fixed and intended for shaping.   Application to the manufacture of components or profiles from reclaimed plastic.
