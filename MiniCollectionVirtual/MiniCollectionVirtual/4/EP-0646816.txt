<ABSTRACT>
An optical module comprises a plastic package (10) 
constituted by a package main body (12) and a cover (14), 

sleeves (30,31) formed integrally with the package main 
body (12), a circuit board (20) held in the package main body 

(12), light-activated elements fixed at predetermined 
positions of the circuit board (20), three projections (50) 

to (52) formed integrally with an inner surface of the 
package main body (12) and brought into contact with a 

periphery of the circuit board (20) to position the circuit 
board (20) and springs (54 to 56) formed integrally with an 

inner surface of the package (10) to press the periphery of 
the circuit board (20) against the projections. Since the 

sleeves (30,31) and the package main body (12) are 
integrally formed by plastic molding, the number of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical module
used in an optical communication system such as an
optical data link or an optical local area network (LAN),
which uses light as an information transmission medium.As optical modules used in an optical communication
system, there are a transmission module using an
element such as an LED or a semiconductor
laser as an electrooptic converting element
(light-emitting element), and a reception module using an
element such as a pin-photodiode as a
photoelectric converting element (light-receiving
element). Such an optical module generally has an
element such as a light-emitting element
or a light-receiving element, electronic components
electrically connected to the element and
arranged on a circuit board, a lens system, and a sleeve
in which the end portion of an optical fiber is inserted.
For an optical fiber with a fiber core having a diameter
of several ten µm, the element, the lens
system, and the sleeve must be assembled at high 
precision. For this reason, an optical module as shown in
Fig. 1 is conventionally used.The optical module shown in Fig. 1 has a cylindrical
holding body 1. The holding body 1 is formed of a metal
such as stainless steel. A lens (not shown) is arranged
in the holding body 1 at one end. The other end portion
of the holding body 1 serves as a sleeve for receiving a
ferrule (not shown) at the end portion of an optical
fiber. A phototransducer element 2 is fixed to the
holding body 1 with an adhesive or the like. The
element 2 is arranged such that the
optical axes of the element 2, the ferrule connected to
the holding body 1 and the lens are matched with each
other.The holding body 1 having the
element 2 fixed therein is supported, together with a
circuit board 3, by a package main body 4 consisting of a
ceramic or metal. The terminals of the
element 2 are connected by soldering (not shown) to
electronic components 5 such as bare chip ICs mounted on
the circuit board 3.The package main body 4 has inner lead pins 6 mounted
inside the body 4, and outer lead pins 7 mounted outside
the body 4 and electrically connected to the inner lead
pins 6. The inner lead pins 6 are electrically connected
to terminals on the circuit board 3 by soldering. The 
wiring pattern and the electronic components 5 are sealed
by a lid 8. Finally, a cover 9 is fixed to the package
main body 4, thereby completing the optical module.In the conventional optical module as described
above, the phototransducer element 2 is held by the
holding body 1 formed of a
