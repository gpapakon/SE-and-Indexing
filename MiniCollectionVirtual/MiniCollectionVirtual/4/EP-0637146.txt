<ABSTRACT>
An optical communication system includes a transmitter and a receiver and a 
single local oscillator (2) serving both the transmitter and the receiver, the output (4) 

of the local oscillator (2) is directly fed to one input of a coherent receiver (5) which 
also receives on another input (6) a modulated spectrum and which gives as an 

output (7) an intermediate frequency spectrum to a bi-polar frequency reverse slope 
discriminator (9) which includes an adder circuit to recover the received data using the 

transmitted data stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical communication system and particularly to 
a system relying on optical fibre communications and employing lasers for both 
reception and transmission of signals incorporating the super heterodyne principle. 
In any communication system employing the super heterodyne principle a local 
oscillator is employed to generate a locally produced signal to be imposed on a 
received or transmitted signal to produce a necessary beat function. If optical 
communication equipment includes both receiver and transmitters then each part of 
the equipment, i.e. the transmitter and the receiver each require a laser. Since lasers 
are expensive, it has been proposed that a single laser should be used to perform 
both roles and the proposal has been that the local oscillator laser should act not only 
as a reception but also as a transmitter laser. It is a disadvantage of this technique 
that modulating the transmitter frustrates the receiver function. This requires either 
partial duplex operation (transmitting or receiving) or the employment of an external 
modulator, which can be both expensive and lossy, so that an unmodulated signal is 
available to the receiver. It is an object of the present invention to provide a improved optical 
communication system using a single laser which permits both transmission and 
receiver operation. According to the present invention in an optical communication system including  
 
a transmitter and a receiver and a single local oscillator serving both the transmitter 
and the receiver, the output of the local oscillator is directly fed to one input of a 
coherent receiver which also receives at another input a modulated spectrum and 
which gives as an output an intermediate frequency spectrum to a bi-polar frequency 
discriminator which includes an adder circuit to recover the received data using the 
transmitted data stream. Preferably the discriminator is a reverse slope discriminator and maps the 
intermediate frequency components to a normalized bi-polar output. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the two 
figures of the accompanying drawings. In the Figures, Figure 1 shows the design of 
an optical communicator system incorporating a coherent transceiver embodying the 
invention and Figure 2 shows the frequency spectra used with the design of Figure 1. Referring first to Figure 1 this shows lines 1A and 1B over which data is 
optically transmitted and received respectively, a local laser oscillator 2 which
