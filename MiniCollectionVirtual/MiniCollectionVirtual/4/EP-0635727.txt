<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic resonance imaging apparatus includes a 
surface coil for receiving NMR signals released from an 

examinee, and an image regenerating unit for regenerating 
a sectional image (original image) based on the 

signals received. A sensitivity distribution identifier 
obtains sensitivity distribution data of the surface 

coil for each pixel in the original image by extracting 
low frequency components from spatial frequency of the 

image. A correction factor calculator derives correction 
factor data by substituting a predetermined 

function into the sensitivity distribution data. An 
output image calculator determines an image (output 

image) with improved luminance by calculating, for each 
pixel, a product of luminance of each pixel in the 

original image and the correction factor data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance 
imaging apparatus (or MRI apparatus), and more particularly 
to a technique of remedying a lack of uniformity 
in the luminance of sectional images obtained with MRI 
apparatus. In an MRI apparatus for obtaining sectional images 
of a particular site such as a shoulder or the spinal 
column of an examinee, a surface coil is often employed 
as a coil for receiving nuclear magnetic resonance 
signals (hereinafter referred to as NMR signals also) 
released from the examinee. This is because the 
surface coil provides sectional images of high signal-to-noise 
ratio. However, the surface coil has such a 
characteristic that its reception sensitivity lowers 
with an increase in the distance between the surface 
coil and an NMR signal source. This results in a lack 
of uniformity in the sensitivity distribution over an 
entire sectional image, and hence non-uniformity in the 
luminance of the sectional image obtained. Generally, luminance i(x, y) of each pixel in a  
 
sectional image obtained (assuming that the sectional 
image is in x, y plane) may be expressed by a product 
of luminance j(x, y) of each pixel in an image which 
should be obtained if the surface coil had a uniform 
sensitivity distribution, and sensitivity distribution 
data α (x, y) (where 0 ≦ α (x, y) ≦ 1) of the surface 
coil for each pixel in the image, as in the following 
equation:

i(x, y) = j(x, y) * α(x, y)   (1) 


 
   Thus, luminance j(x, y) of each pixel in the image 
which should be obtained if the surface coil had a 
uniform sensitivity distribution is derived, in conventional 
practice, from luminance i(x, y) of each pixel 
in the sectional image actually obtained, using the 
following equation: 
   Conventionally, the sensitivity distribution data 
of the surface coil is determined by the following 
methods: The sensitivity distribution data of the surface 
coil is calculated by magnetic field analysis. That is, based on a positional relationship 
between each pixel in the sectional image obtained and  
 
the surface coil, a pixel for which the surface coil is 
capable of receiving NMR signals with the best sensitivity 
is identified by magnetic field analysis. The 
sensitivity of the surface coil for that pixel is set 
to "1" (maximum sensitivity). Next, reception sensitivity 
ratios of the other pixels with respect to the 
sensitivity "1" pixel are computed by magnetic field 
analysis, based on positional relationships between 
these pixels and the surface coil. Sensitivity
