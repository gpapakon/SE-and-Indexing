<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to paste compositions 
containing metal pigments suitable for forming coating 
compositions, particularly aqueous coating systems. Increasingly 
stringent environmental regulations have required that coating 
systems dramatically reduce volatile organic solvent levels. One 
way to comply with such regulations is to use water in place of 
the volatile organic solvents previously used. However, in the area of coating systems utilizing metal pigment 
particles, aqueous systems present rather formidable difficulties. 
This is particularly true with respect to aluminum and zinc 
pigments. Thus, the metal pigment can readily react with water to 
generate hydrogen gas. The amount of gas generated can produce a 
safety hazard, creating high pressures within the composition 
containers. Also, the water reaction substantially diminishes the 
aesthetic value of metal pigments. The reaction of aluminum 
pigments with water can be depicted as follows: 
2A1 + 6H2O    2A1(OH)3 + 3H2(g)Due to the increasing demand for aqueous systems, a number of 
techniques have been proposed for inhibiting the attack on the 
pigment particles by water. Unfortunately, most of these 
techniques have not provided sufficient protection. One technique that provides inhibiting properties is the 
passivation of the metal pigment particles with an ionic organic 
phosphate as disclosed by Williams et al., U.S. Patent No. 
4,565,716. Other techniques involve the use of compounds 
containing pentavalent vanadium compounds as disclosed in Kondis 
U.S. Patent No. 4,693,754, or the use of organic phosphites as 
disclosed in Kondis et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,808,231. Another 
composition of matter utilized to produce an aluminum paste for 
use in aqueous systems uses nitroparaffin solvents to inhibit the 
evolution of hydrogen gas. However, through the addition of nitro-containing 
solvents we have improved upon the passivation of metal 
pigment particles utilizing organic phosphates, phosphites, or 
vanadium compounds.  
 According to a first aspect, the present invention relates to a paste suitable 
for formation of a coating composition, comprising metal pigment particles; a 
member of the group consisting of an organic phosphate, an organic phosphite and 
a pentavalent vanadium compound; and a solvent which comprises a nitro-containing 
compound constituted by an alkyl or aryl compound having 1 to 20 
carbon atoms or a halo or amino-substituted alkyl or aryl compound having 1 to 
20 carbon atoms and a nitro (-NO2)
