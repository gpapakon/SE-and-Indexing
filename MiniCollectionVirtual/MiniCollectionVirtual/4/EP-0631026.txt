<ABSTRACT>
A scaffolding floor (20) has longitudinal members (25.1, 25.2) and transverse connecting parts. A grating (38) is fixedly installed between the fastening portions (40). Said grating has outer metal frameplates (41) and inner, intersecting metal support plates (45). The profile of the longitudinal members (25.1, 25.2) has a vertical outer wall, a horizontal lower wall and an obliquely running discharge inner wall (28) which merges into the vertical inner leg with an undulate bent-off portion. The grating is fastened on said inner leg.

<CLAIMS>
A scaffolding frame floor (20) having externally situated longitudinal rails (25.1, 
25.2) with transverse connecting parts (21) which are situated at their end faces, 

which join the longitudinal rails (25.1, 25.2) and with which suspension means (17) 
are associated, and having a planar supporting structure which can be walked on, 

which forms the bearing surface and which allows liquids to pass through,
 
characterised in that, for the purpose of preventing deposition surfaces for granular 

abrasion-blasting material, the thickness of the upper, opening-delimiting ribs of the 
longitudinal rails (25.1, 25.2), and of a supporting grid structure (38) which forms 

the bearing surface is only one to four times the thickness of the material of the sheet 
metal of the basic supporting material, and the lower regions of the widened sections 

(27) of the longitudinal rails (25.1, 25.2) which are necessary for reasons of support 
and stability, and optionally of other parts of the supporting structure, are led towards 

the widest extent of the parts of the supporting structure by sloping faces (28) which 

permit run-off. 
A scaffolding frame floor according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the longitudinal rail section comprises an externally situated outer 

wall (26) forming a vertical rib, a radiused bottom wall (27) in the region of the 
lower end of the outer wall, which bottom wall forms a horizontal flange and is 

optionally attached via a corrugation, and a radiused transition corner which points 
towards the inside of the frame, and comprises a sloping face (28) which is attached 

to the transition corner and which is provided with a vertical joining limb (34), and 
wherein the upper vertical parts are joined, preferably by welding, to the grid-like 

supporting structure (38) forming a jointly supporting composite. 
A scaffolding frame floor according to claim 1 or 2,
  
 

characterised in that the upper end of the outer vertical rib is provided, by folding it 
inwards, with an inside, vertical inner limb (34) which serves for stability and 

attachment. 
A scaffolding frame floor according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that when it is formed from a flat metal sheet the folded joint in the 

region of the inner limb (34) is formed with its end section parts aligned one on top 
of the other. 
A scaffolding frame floor according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the supporting structure is formed from thin, vertical sheet metal 

parts (45) which are brought into engagement at their points of intersection by 
corresponding cut-outs and which are joined, preferably by welding, to the outer 

frame regions. 
A scaffolding frame floor according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the planar supporting structure is formed from a grating (38). 
A scaffolding frame floor according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that suspension claws (17) formed from sheet metal are fixedly 

disposed on the transverse connecting parts (21).
