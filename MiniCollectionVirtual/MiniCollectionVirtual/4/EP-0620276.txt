<ABSTRACT>
CDR-grafted antibody heavy and light chains comprise 
acceptor framework and donor antigen binding regions, the 

heavy chains comprising donor residues at at least one of 
positions (6, 23) and/or (24, 48) and/or (49, 71) and/or 

(73, 75) and/or (76) and/or (78) and/or (91). The 
CDR-grated light chains comprise donor residues at at least 

one of positions (1) and/or (3) and (46) and/or (47) or at 
at least one of positions (46, 48, 58) and (71). The CDR-grafted 

antibodies are preferably humanised antibodies, 
having non-human, e.g. rodent, donor residues and human 

acceptor frameworks, and may be used for 
in vivo
 therapy and 
diagnosis.
 A generally applicable protocol is disclosed for 
obtaining CDR-grafted antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to humanised antibody 
molecules, to processes for their production using 
recombinant DNA technology, and to their therapeutic uses. The term "humanised antibody molecule" in used to describe 
a molecule having an antigen binding site derived from an 
immunoglobulin from a non-human species, and remaining 
immunoglobulin-derived parts of the molecule being derived 
from a human immunoglobulin. The antigen binding site 
typically comprises complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs) which determine the binding specificity of the 
antibody molecule and which are carried on appropriate 
framework regions in the variable domains. There are 3 
CDRs (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) in each of the heavy and light 
chain variable domains. In the description, reference is made to a number of 
publications by number. The publications are listed in 
numerical order at the end of the description. Natural immunoglobulins have been known for many years, as 
have the various fragments thereof, such as the Fab, 
(Fab')â‚‚ and Fc fragments, which can be derived by 
enzymatic cleavage. Natural immunoglobulins comprise a 
generally Y-shaped molecule having an antigen-binding site 
towards the end of each upper arm. The remainder of the 
structure, and particularly the stem of the Y, mediates 
the effector functions associated with immunoglobulins. Natural immunoglobulins have been used in assay, diagnosis 
and, to a more limited extent, therapy. However, such 
uses, especially in therapy, were hindered until recently 
by the polyclonal nature of natural immunoglobulins. A 
significant step towards the realisation of the potential  
 
of immunoglobulins as therapeutic agents was the discovery 
of procedures for the production of monoclonal antibodies 
(MAbs) of defined specificity (1). However, most MAbs are produced by hybridomas which are 
fusions of rodent spleen cells with rodent myeloma 
cells. They are therefore essentially rodent proteins. 
There are very few reports of the production of human MAbs. Since most available MAbs are of rodent origin, they are 
naturally antigenic in humans and thus can give rise to an 
undesirable immune response termed the HAMA (Human 
Anti-Mouse Antibody) response. Therefore, the use of 
rodent MAbs as therapeutic agents in humans is inherently 
limited by the fact that the human subject will mount an 
immunological response to the MAb and will either remove 
it entirely or at least reduce its effectiveness. In 
practice, MAbs of rodent origin may not be used in 
pati
