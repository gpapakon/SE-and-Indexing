<ABSTRACT>
A process and an apparatus are provided for unwinding an 
integrated web (W) of woven or nonwoven, hydrophobic or hydrophyllic 

coverstock material for baby diapers or other similar 
sanitary disposable absorbent products, such as sanitary 

napkins, adult products and the like, feeding that web (W) 
through a press or calender roll (23,24) to provide a uniform 

structure, and thereafter applying, a surfactant (or 
hydrophobicity-inducing) material (26) in selective areas of the web. 

Thereafter, the web may be passed through a drying system (33) 
so as to set or cure a coating material. The treated web 

may be wound in a roll (35) which is subsequently used on a 
diaper-making machine, or it may be fed directly to a 

diaper machine on which a partially assembled baby diaper 
is being made. The treated areas are placed accurately on 

an appropriate area of the diaper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process and apparatus for 
applying a coating of selected material to the surface 
of a well-integrated thin flexible porous web. It is well known in the art for the manufacture of disposable 
baby diapers or other sanitary disposable absorbent 
products such as sanitary napkins, adult incontinence pads, 
and hospital bed pads to provide a structure wherein the 
coversheet or coverstock or top sheet, i.e. that portion of 
the product which is in contact with the patient's skin, is 
made of hydrophyllic material such as rayon, so as to be 
pervious to liquids such as urine. This permits ready pass-through 
of the liquid into the absorbent core or the pad 
which lies directly beneath the coverstock. In the past, 
some of the coverstocks have also been made of cotton, or 
blends of cotton and rayon or blends of rayon with a bonding 
fiber such as polyethylene. Such coverstock, however, has been undesirable because it 
tends to retain the moisture and thus feel wet to touch and 
because it keeps the skin wet and is more likely to cause 
skin rash or diaper rash or the like.  Therefore, in more recent years, it has been found desirable 
to use a coverstock made of hydrophobic fibers or 
filaments, such as polypropylene or polyester, either 
carded, spun-bonded or melt-blown, or the like, but because 
such material inherently tends to interfere with the pass-through 
of urine into the absorbent pad, it has been found 
necessary to treat the web with a hydrophyllicity-inducing 
material such as a surfactant. In order to do this, the diaper is provided with a continuous 
strip of hydrophobic material which has been over-all 
coated with a surfactant to make it pervious to urine. The 
coverstock web thus formed is laid continuously on the 
diaper as it is constructed on the diaper-making machine, 
but much of the web has been coated in areas where perviousness 
is not only unnecessary but also undesirable. For 
reasons of economy, the web is usually made of spun-bonded 
polypropylene or a carded thermo-bonded polypropylene or 
polyester fiber. In a more recent form of diaper construction, 
a separate web of hydrophyllic material is assembled 
between two webs made of hydrophobic fibers. This enables 
the coverstock material, when placed upon a diaper, with 
the pervious strip generally in the center of the diaper, 
to have the advantage of permitting the urine to pass 
through, but also to resist the transfer of urine along the 
sides of the coverstock and, therefore, contained within

<CLAIMS>
A process for applying a coating of selected material 
to the surface of a well-integrated thin flexible 

porous web, which process includes 

supplying a web of material, 
passing said web over an applying roll, 
providing said roll with a patterned area, 
rotating said roll in a supply of selected material 
so that said patterned area carries the selected 

material to the web when the roll is rotated, 
limiting the selected material on the web to an area 
defined by the pattern area. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said web is a nonwoven 
made of hydrophobic material and said selected material 

renders the patterned areas pervious to the 
passage of liquid. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said web is a nonwoven 
made of hydrophyllic material and said selected material 

renders the patterned areas impervious to the 
passage of liquid. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said web is woven of 
hydrophyllic material and said selected material 

renders the patterned areas impervious to the passage 
of liquid. 
The process of claim 2 wherein said web is spunbonded, 
melt blown or thermo-bonded. 
The process of claim 3 or claim 4 wherein said web is 
made of cotton or of rayon. 
The process according to one of the claims 1 to 6 
wherein the process of coating the web takes place in 

synchronism with the operation of a diaper-making 
machine, and the web is applied directly to the diaper 

being made on the machine. 
The process according to one of the claims 1 to 7 
wherein the area of selected material on the web is 

discontinous. 
The process of claim 7 wherein the area of the web 
containing the selected material overlies or does not 

overlie the crotch area of the diaper made on the 
machine. 
The process according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein areas of the web containing the selected 

material are continuous and are between three and 
seven inches wide and are separated by continous areas 

of between eight and twelve inches wide which do not 
contain the selected material. 
The process of claim 10 wherein the continous areas 
containing the selected material are each five inches 

wide and the continuous areas without the selected 
material are each ten inches wide. 
The process according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein the web is finally wound up into a finished 

roll. 
The process of claim 12 wherein the finished roll is 
slit into a plurality of narrow rolls. 
The process of claims 11 to 13 wherein the web is 
wound up into a finished roll and the finished roll is 

slit into a plurality of narrow rolls in the middle of 
the continuous areas which do not have the selected 

material. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one 
of the claims 1 to 14. 
Coated web produced according to one of the claims 1 
to 14 or with an apparatus according to claim 15.
