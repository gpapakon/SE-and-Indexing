<ABSTRACT>
A flow-through nucleic acid hybridization assay method employing a porous 
membrane of nylon activated for covalent attachment of proteins. The choice of materials and 

methods obviates the need for incubation of the membrane with the hybridization solution 
prior to initiating flow-through, resulting in a simpler and more rapid assay method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to membrane flow-through assays for nucleic acids, in 
particular nucleic acid sandwich hybridization assays. Hybridization of complementary nucleic acid sequences is a well known means for 
identifying, detecting and isolating specific nucleic acids and nucleic acid sequences. Such 
hybridization methods form the basis of many current nucleic acid assays. The principle of 
hybridization assays is to expose two or more single stranded nucleic acids to each other, 
allow complementary sequences to hybridize, and then measure the amount of double stranded 
nucleic acid formed. The nucleic acid or sequence which is sought to be identified, detected 
or isolated is customarily called the target nucleic acid or target sequence. A single stranded nucleic acid or sequence which is used to bind to the target nucleic 
acid to isolate, identify or detect is customarily called a probe. In some methods of nucleic 
acid hybridization, more than one probe may be used for different purposes. A probe often 
has a detectable label incorporated into the structure of the probe which facilitates 
identification of the target nucleic acid when the probe hybridizes to it. The label produces a 
signal which can be detected either visually or by instrumentation. In solution hybridization procedures, the target nucleic acid and the probe(s) are 
brought together in solution and allowed to hybridize. Hybridization of the probe to the target 
can be followed by changes in optical density as double stranded nucleic acid is formed. 
Alternatively, double stranded nucleic acid may be separated from unreacted single strands 
and detected by means of a label present in the hybridized material. For example, 
hydroxyapatite can be used to selectively bind double stranded nucleic acids or S1 nuclease 
can be used to specifically degrade unreacted single stranded nucleic acid, which can then be  
 
separated from hybridized double stranded nucleic acid by size separation methods known in 
the art. Solution hybridization is rapid and allows for efficient reaction between 
complementary nucleic acid sequences. However, subsequent separation and detection of the 
hybridized products is labor intensive, time consuming and difficult to automate. In an 
attempt to overcome some of these drawbacks, solid-surface hybridization methods have been 
developed in which one of the single stranded components of the hybridization mixture is 
immobilized on a solid support. Hybridization of the immobilized nucleic acid with

A method for detecting a target nucleic acid in a sample comprising: 

a) hybridizing the target nucleic acid in solution with at least one detector 
probe including a detectable label and at least one capture probe including a biotin 

label such that a probe:target complex is formed; 
b) applying the solution containing the probe:target complex to a porous 
membrane comprising nylon activated for covalent attachment of proteins, the 

membrane having thereon 5-100µg of streptavidin in a test site; 
c) allowing unrestricted flow of the solution through the membrane such that 
the probe:target complex becomes bound to the membrane at the test site, and; 
d) detecting, by means of the detectable label, the probe:target complex 
bound to the membrane. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the complex is detected by means of an 
enzyme label which is reacted to form a colored reaction product. 
The method of Claim 2 wherein the membrane has about 50µg of 
streptavidin in the test site. 
The method of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the capture probe, detector probe 
and target nucleic acid are hybridized at room temperature. 
The method of Claim 4 wherein the capture probe, detector probe and 
target nucleic acid are hybridized in a buffer including an ingredient selected from 

the group consisting of 10-50% v/v formamide, 10-50% w/v sodium trichloroacetate 
and 10-50% v/v sodium trifluoroacetate. 
The method of Claim 5 wherein the buffer includes an ingredient selected 
from the group consisting of 35% v/v formamide, 25% w/v sodium trichloroacetate
