<ABSTRACT>
In a system that uses a dither signal d(k) in the production or a 
transmitted signal, the recoverability of an original trellis code is maintained while 

forming the dither signal using a modulo value that is equal to the distance between 
two adjacent symbols. This is accomplished by forming individual modulo counts 

(xcnt, ycnt) for each of the orthogonal components produced by the transmitter's 3-tap 
FIR filter (66). The modulo counts and the bits from the trellis encoder (50) are 

used to substitute the constellation subset identified by the trellis encoder (50) with 
another constellation subset. The substituted subset is used for transmission and 

results in recovery of the original trellis code by the trellis decoder in the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to encoding data for transfer over a
communication channel; more specifically, communicating data over a telephone
communication channel which is susceptible to inter-symbol interference.U.S. Patent 5,162,812, entitled "Technique for Achieving the Full
Coding Gain of Encoded Digital Signals", discloses a system in which a transmitted
signal is encoded using a trellis code and precoded using a generalized partial
response filter. FIG. 1 illustrates the transmitter disclosed in the aforementioned
U.S. Patent. Serial-to-parallel converter 10 converts the incoming data to parallel
words. Trellis encoder 12 encodes the parallel word to provide increased immunity
to inter-symbol interference. Symbol mapper 14 maps the trellis encoded word to a
signal point in a predefined symbol or signal point constellation. The symbol
specified by symbol mapper 14 is in the form of a complex number which is received
by precoding unit 16. Precoding unit 16 is used to compensate for signal distortions
that are introduced at a receiver when the receiver passed the symbol through a noise
whitening filter. Received symbols are passed through a noise whitening filter to
compensate for the communication channel's colored noise and thereby improve
proper decoding of the trellis code. Precoder 16 includes transversal filter 18 and
non-linear filter 20. Non-linear filter 20 is in the form of a modulo device that
repeatedly subtracts or adds a value of 2L until the output α of the device satisfies -L
≤ α ≤ L. Non-linear filter 20 is used to compensate for any instability introduced by
filter 18. The output of encoder 16 is modulated by modulator 19 using a
modulation technique such as QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). The output
of modulator 19 is filtered by filter 20, passed through hybrid 22, and then out to
local telephone loop 24.A similar system is disclosed in a paper presented to Technical
Committee TR-30 of the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) in Atlanta,
Georgia on April 15, 1993. The paper is entitled "Implementation of Precoding in
V-FAST" authored by Eyuboglu et al. FIG. 2 illustrates the precoder disclosed in
the paper. Precoder 30 is similar to precoder 16. In this embodiment both the FIR
filter and the modulo device are in the feedback loop. The FIR filter is disclosed as a
3-tap filter and the output of the modulo device is subtracted from the input to the 
precoder.Both of the aforementioned systems precode the data so that there is compensation for the
effects of the noise
