<ABSTRACT>
A toy wheel or disk is disclosed which is adapted to be 
propelled along by air movement. The wheel or disk has an 

outer edge (2) for rolling over a surface and opposite faces 
from which a plurality of flanges (3) extend outwardly to 

each side. The flanges are shaped to catch air draughts so 
that the wheel or disk may be propelled in rolling motion 

on its outer edge by wind force acting on the flanges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to toys or novelty items and more particularly 
although not exclusively to a wind powered toy wheel. A variety of rolling toy hoops and wheels have been known for many 
years. These have typically been propelled by means of the child 
running along beside and periodically pushing it either with the hand 
or foot or perhaps a stick. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved 
toy wheel or disk which is propelled along without any 
effort by the user, the wheel or disk having an outer 
edge adapted for rolling over a surface and opposite faces 
from which a plurality of flanges extend outwardly to 
each side, said flanges being adapted to catch air 
draughts whereby in use said wheel or disk may be propelled 
in rolling motion on its outer edge by wind force acting 
on said flanges. In another aspect this invention also discloses a piece 
of sheet material or packaging having marked thereon a 
plurality of lines arranged so that a user may form the 
aforementioned toy wheel or disk by folding and severing 
along said lines. Preferably said flanges are spaced from the centre of 
the wheel or disk, are substantially flat and are  
 
positioned at about 90 degrees to a radius of said 
wheel or disk. The currently preferred form of this invention will now 
be described with reference to the attached illustrations 
in which: 
Figures 1 and 2are prespective views 
of a toy wheel according to this 
invention from each side, Figure 3is a side elevation view of the wheel of 
figure 1, Figure 4is an edge view of the wheel of 
figure 1, and Figure 5shows the manner in which the wheel 
of figure 1 may be formed from a 
piece of sheet material such as 
packaging cardboard. Referring first to figures 1 to 4 the wheel may comprise 
a plane sided rim 1 with an outer edge 2 adapted for 
rolling over a substantially flat surface 2A. A plurality 
of flanges or wings 3 extend from an inner edge 3A of 
this rim. These flanges are arranged to protrude alternately 
to each side of the wheel. With this particular embodiment 
there are four such flanges on each side. They are 
substantially flat with inner faces 4 turned towards the  
 
centre of the wheel and outer faces 5 directed away 
towards the periphery or outer edge 2. It will be noted 
that these inner and outer faces 4 and 5 when orientated 
perpendicular to the ground surface (as at A and B) form 
draught catching areas which serve to propel the wheel 
along with the direction of a horizontal wind force C.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A wheel or disk for use as a toy which is adapted 
to be propelled along by air movement, said wheel or 

disk having an outer edge adapted for rolling over a 
surface and opposite faces from which a plurality of 

flanges extend outwardly to each side, said flanges 
being adapted to catch air draughts whereby in use said 

wheel or disk may be propelled in rolling motion on its 
outer edge by wind force acting on said flanges. 
The wheel or disk as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
flanges have inner faces turned substantially towards 

the centre of the wheel or disk and outer faces substantially 
directed towards the periphery or outer edge. 
The wheel or disk as claimed in claim 2 and further 
comprising a plane sided rim which defines said outer 

edge and said plurality of flanges extend from an inner 
edge of said rim. 
The wheel or disk as claimed in claim 3 wherein said 
flanges are arranged to protrude alternately to each side 

of the wheel. 
The wheel or disk as claimed in claim 4 wherein the 
faces of said flanges are substantially flat. 
The wheel or disk as claimed in claim 5 wherein said 
faces are generally triangular in shape. 
A piece of sheet material for forming the wheel or 
disk as claimed in claim 1, said sheet having marked 

thereon a circular cutting line defining the edge of 
said wheel, spaced radial cutting lines along directions 

through the centre defined by said circular cutting line 
to form the edges of said flanges, said radial cutting 

lines terminating a predetermined distance from said 
circular cutting line whereby the extremities of adjacent 

ones of said radial cutting lines define between them 
folding lines whereby said flanges may be turned outwardly 

to each side of said wheel. 
The piece of sheet material as claimed in claim 7 
whereby said predetermined distance is about 25% of the 

radius of the wheel defined by said circular cutting 
edge. 
A wheel or disk substantially as described herein 
with reference to figures 1 to 3.
