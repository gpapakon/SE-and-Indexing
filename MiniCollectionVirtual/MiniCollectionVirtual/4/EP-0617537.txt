<ABSTRACT>
A conferencing bridging technique for compressed information signals 
which monitors the signal energy transmitted by each conferee. When there is only 

one conferee speaking, the summing circuit in the bridge unit is bypassed along with 
the speech decoding/coding apparatus and the talking conferee's signal is broadcast 

to all conferees. If there is more than one conferee speaking at any given time, then 
only the speaking conferee's signals are routed to an associated speech decoder 

wherein those conferees' compressed signals are decompressed. These 
decompressed signals are then combined by the summing circuit and the sum is 

recompressed and broadcast to all conferees. Advantageously, the above-described 
technique eliminates the signal degradation associated with tandeming of signal 

decoding and coding operations and permits the sharing of a smaller number of 
signal decoders among a larger number of conferees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique for
providing conferencing capability and, more particularly, to
a technique for providing this capability when the signals to
be conferenced are compressed.Conferencing is the capability of coupling information
signals among three or more users in a communications system.
The information signals are typically voice signals but, with
the advent of multimedia communications capabilities, can
also be nonvoice signals, i.e., data, video, facsimile and
the like.Signal compression techniques have long been used to
reduce the bandwidth required for signal transmission. These
techniques have been used for both voice and data signals.When compressed information signals are conferenced
using existing conference bridging techniques, the compressed
signals are each decompressed, summed and this sum is then
recompressed and broadcast to all conferees. The problem with
this approach is that the tandeming, i.e., serial connection
of signal coders and decoders to respectively compress and
decompress the information signal, degrades the resulting
signal quality to a level that, in trial studies, has been
found to be objectionable to many conferees. Another problem
is that the bridging apparatus can be costly, especially for 
conference bridging apparatus capable of conferencing a large
number of conferees. At times, the signal degradation and/or
the apparatus costs associated with conferencing equipment
can exceed system objectives. At such times, the prior art
solution has been to utilize only uncompressed signals. This
solution, in turn, requires a higher bandwidth communications
channel between any potential conferee and the conferencing
apparatus. This requirement can be expensive or difficult to
provide. This is especially true in communications system
applications where the number of potential conferees is quite
large. It would, therefore, be desirable if a conferencing
arrangement could be devised for compressed signals which
overcomes the limitations of the prior art.EP-A- 0 067 006 discloses a digital conference circuit
comprising a decision circuit. The decision circuit makes a
decision based on the largest average magnitude of each
conferee's words in order to detect the two loudest words
which are transmitted to each conferee. Prior to their
transmission a predetermined amount of attentuation is
inserted into the words. The present invention relates to a conferencing arrangement for
compressed information signals. Pursuant to the present invention, when there is
