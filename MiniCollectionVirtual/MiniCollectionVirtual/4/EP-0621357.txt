<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for producing a polyester fiber involving the steps of cooling a plurality 
of polyester fibers melt-spun from a spinneret (2) to a temperature below a glass transition point, taking up the fibers at a take-up 

speed of less than 4,000 m/min by a non-hated first godet roller (7), heat-stretching the fibers in a normal-pressure steam atmosphere 
at a temperature above a glass transition point of the polyester fiber (first heat-treating apparatus (8)) between the first 

non-heated godet roller (7) and a second non-heated godet roller (10), and heat-treating the fiber in a pressurization steam atmosphere 
at above 105 °C (second heat-treating apparatus (9)).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus
for producing a polyester fiber. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for producing a polyester fiber having
mechanical and thermal characteristics suitable for
the application of woven fabrics and knitted fabrics
and having particularly excellent dyeing
characteristics.As one of the methods of producing a polyester
fiber having strength and elongation characteristics
suitable for woven fabrics and knitted fabrics at a
low cost of production, a so-called "direct spin draw
system" has been proposed as described, for example,
in Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication No.
54-18918. According to this system, melt-and-spun
polyester fibers are wound a plurality of times on a
pair of heated godet rollers (hereinafter referred to
as the "heating godet rollers") and on separate
rollers to raise the fiber temperature, are again
wound on another pair of heating godet rollers
rotating at a higher speed and separate rollers, a
plurality of times, respectively, and are stretched
between both groups of rollers.According to this production method, however, the 
fibers must be wound a large number of times on the
heating godet rollers through the separate rollers so
as to sufficiently heat the fibers. Therefore, when
the number of spun yarns is increased to improve
productivity, adjacent yarns are likely to overlap
with one another to cause yarn breakage, the equipment
becomes large in scale and power consumption of the
heating rollers becomes greater.To solve these problems, Japanese Patent
Application Kokai Publication No. 62-141118 proposes a
method which takes up the melt-and-spun yarns on non-heating
rollers rotating at a speed of higher than
4,000 m/min, then draws the yarns while jetting a
heating steam to the yarns to heat them to a
temperature higher than their glass transition point.
Though this production method provides the advantage
that the separate rollers become unnecessary, it is
not free from the following problems because the
method is fundamentally based on the premise of high
speed take-up at higher than 4,000 m/min. Namely,
when the melt-and-spun yarns travel between a
spinneret and a high speed take-up roller, a structure
rich of a crystalline phase is formed due to cooling
of the yarns by air and to a drawing operation, and 
even when drawing and heat-treatment (heat-set) are
thereafter applied so as to obtain a predetermined
elongation, the degree of orientation (birefringence)
of the fibers finally
