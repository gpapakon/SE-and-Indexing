<ABSTRACT>
An actuator (1) for a liquid spray pump (3) is provided 
with a skirt (38) which co-operates with a body (39) of the pump 

to compress a volume of air (32) during pump actuation. 
Air compressed by this action is ejected from an air 

injection channel in the vicinity of a liquid spray 
emerging from a first nozzle (12) defined by the actuator. 

A second nozzle (17) is connected to the actuator 
externally of the first nozzle (12) to define an air gap (30) 

therebetween and the air ejection channel (31) communicates 
with the air gap such that in use both the liquid 

spray and the compressed air are dispensed through the 
second nozzle aperture (18). Primarily intended for 

dispensing water based products, the effect of the 
compressed air is to assist in the evaporation of 

water contained in the liquid or any other volatile 
liquid dissolved in a liquid product to be dispensed 

in aerosol form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for 
dispensing liquid as an atomised spray and in 
particular but not exclusively to apparatus for 
dispensing a water-borne liquid product. Recent trends in the manner in which hair sprays 
and the like have been delivered in aerosol form have 
resulted in liquid products being dispensed in aqueous 
solution by manually operated pumps for example. The 
use of environmentally damaging volatile propellants 
is thereby avoided but users find the characteristics 
of the resulting water-borne spray to be less 
desirable in some respects. It has been proposed in US-4057176 to improve 
the quality of a water-borne spray by dispensing 
compressed air simultaneously with dispensed liquid in 
order to both assist the breakup of the spray into 
finely divided particles and to produce a dryer spray 
in the sense that some of the water content is 
evaporated from the sprayed liquid as a consequence of 
compressed air being entrained in the spray. It has also been proposed in US-5110029 to 
provide a liquid delivery means with an actuator which 
is constructed so as to provide compressed air during 
actuation by a pumping action associated with manual 
depression of the actuator. The liquid is ejected through a first nozzle and 
the compressed air is directed onto the liquid jet 
before both liquid and air are ejected from a second 
nozzle. According to the present invention there is 
disclosed apparatus for dispensing liquid from a 
reservoir as an atomised spray, comprising a delivery 
means, an actuator defining a dispensing channel and 
being operatively connected to the delivery means  
 
whereby the delivery means is operable by relative 
movement of the actuator to deliver a flow of liquid 
to the dispensing channel, a first nozzle connected to 
the actuator and defining a first nozzle aperture 
communicating with the dispensing channel, air pumping 
means operable by movement of the actuator relative to 
the delivery means to compress an enclosed volume of 
air during actuation of the delivery means, wherein 
the actuator defines an air ejection channel for the 
release of the compressed air, wherein the apparatus 
further comprises a second nozzle connected to the 
actuator externally of the first nozzle, the second 
nozzle defining a second nozzle aperture and having a 
rear face spaced from a front face of the first nozzle 
to define an air gap therebetween, the air gap 
communicating with the second nozzle aperture and the 
air ejection channel, characterised in that

characterised in that the rear face of the second 
nozzle is conically tapered in a direction towards the 

first nozzle, the air ejection channel communicating 
with the air gap at a location circumferential 

relative to the rear face of the second nozzle whereby 
in use a radially inward flow of air entering the air 

gap is deflected by the rear face of the second nozzle
