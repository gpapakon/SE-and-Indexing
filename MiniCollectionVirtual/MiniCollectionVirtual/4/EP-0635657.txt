<ABSTRACT>
Active positioning device for a rubber support (1), comprising a space (3) surrounded by a housing (2), there being arranged within the space (3) a positioning member (4) and a working member (6) configured as a spring element, it being possible to move the positioning member (4) and the working member (6) backwards and forwards in the direction of the vibrations (7) introduced into the rubber support (1), and the positioning member (4) being sealed off relative to the housing (2). The positioning member (4) is formed by a pneumatic spring (8) which can be supplied with pressurised gas, the pneumatic spring (8) comprising at least one piston-cylinder unit (9, 10), which has a rolling diaphragm (11) for sealing off the piston (9) relative to the housing (2). The spring element (5) is formed by a compression spring which is supported, in the direction of the vibrations (7) introduced, on the positioning member (4) on the one hand and on the bearing support (12) of the rubber support (1) on the other and is under elastic prestress.

A rubber mount (1) having a bearing spring (19) 
supported on the bearing mount (12) and an active positioning 

element with an operating member (6) configured 
as a spring element (5), the spring element (5) and the 

actuator (4) being arranged in a space (3) surrounded by 
a housing (2) and being movable back and forth in the 

direction of the vibrations (7) introduced into the 
rubber mount (1), and the actuator (4) being sealed off 

in relation to the housing (2), the spring element (5) 
being formed by a compression spring which, if required, 

can be included as an additionally bearing spring and is 
supported under elastic prestress on the one hand on the 

actuator (4) and on the other hand, being able to be 
included if required by the actuator (4), on the bearing 

mount (12) of the rubber mount (1), characterized in that 
the actuator (4) is formed by a gas compression spring 

(8) which can be pressurized with compressed gas and 
comprises at least one piston-cylinder unit (9, 10) which 

has a rolling diaphragm (11) to seal off the piston (9) 
in relation to the housing (2), and in that the compression 

spring arranged between the bearing mount (12) and 
the piston (9) of the gas compression spring (8) in the 

direction of the vibrations (7) introduced, can be 
displaced together with the piston (9) in relation to the 

bearing mount (12) in such a way that, in one switched 
state, the bearing mount (12) is free from the housing 

(2) firmly connected to the cylinder (10), such that the 
compression spring is subjected to elastic prestress as 

a result of the load imposed on the rubber mount (1) and 
as a result of being connected in series with the bearing  

 
spring (19), and in another switched state the bearing 

mount (12) is supported on the housing (2) with relief of 
the compression spring. 
A rubber mount according to claim 1, characterized 
in that a plurality of piston-cylinder units (9, 10) 

are combined in a parallel connection. 
A rubber mount according to either of claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the pistons (9) can be 

pressurized on one side (13) with a pressure which is 
less than atmospheric pressure and on the other side (14) 

with atmospheric pressure. 
A rubber mount according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the pistons (9) can be pressurized on one 

side (13) with atmospheric pressure and on the other side 
(14) with a pressure which exceeds atmospheric pressure. 
A rubber mount according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the compression spring is formed from a 

metallic material. 
A rubber mount according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the compression spring is formed by a plate 

spring assembly (15). 
A rubber mount according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the housing (2) is provided on the side 

facing the rubber mount (1) with a conically widening 
support face, and in that the support face (16) has a 

rubber coating (17) and can be brought into engagement 
with the bearing mount (12) of the rubber mount (1) in 

the state of the actuator (4) not pressurized by differential 
pressure.
