<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for an image scanning unit (1). This comprises a semiconductor capsule (2) so arranged as to generate electrical signals corresponding to an image incident upon the light-sensitive surface (2a) of the capsule and so arranged as to be connected by soldering to a circuit board (5). Also present are an optical system arranged in a holder (3) for projecting the image to be scanned onto the aforementioned light-sensitive surface (2a) and a mounting plate (4) positioned between the semiconductor capsule (2) and the circuit board (5). Finally, devices (3a, 3b, 4a) are also present for joining together the holder (3) and the mounting plate (4) and for ensuring correct mutual alignment between the semiconductor capsule (2) and the optical system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for an image 
scanning unit comprising a semiconductor package so arranged 
as to generate electrical signals corresponding to an image 
incident upon the light-sensitive surface of the package and 
so arranged as to be connected by soldering to a circuit 
board, an optical system arranged in a holder for projecting 
the image to be scanned onto the aforementioned 
light-sensitive surface, a mounting plate positioned between 
the semiconductor package and the circuit board, and joining 
devices joining together the holder and the mounting plate 
and ensuring correct mutual alignment between the 
semiconductor package and the optical system. An arrangement of this kind is previously disclosed through 
US-A-4,594,613. The mounting plate is attached in this case 
to the holder for the optical system by means of screws and 
pins, which project outwards from the holder and interact 
with holes in the mounting plate in order to ensure the 
desired alignment between the semiconductor package and the 
optical system. The previously disclosed arrangement has a 
comparatively bulky construction and uses many detail 
components which demand a relatively long assembly time; in 
order to be able to fix the holder to the mounting plate with 
screws, or vice versa, openings are also required in the 
actual circuit board. Ensuring that the holder is correctly 
aligned relative to the semiconductor package, as briefly 
described above, means that the accuracy of the alignment may 
be jeopardized. The object of the present invention is to make available an 
arrangement of the kind referred to by way of introduction, 
in which elimination of the above-mentioned disadvantages has  
 
been effected and has been made possible in that in order to 
ensure correct alignment between the optical system and the 
light-sensitive surface of the semiconductor package in the 
longitudinal direction of the semiconductor package, the 
aforementioned joining devices comprise a projection 
projecting from the holder in such a way, when the unit is 
assembled, that it engages between two of the contact legs of 
the semiconductor package, and that for ensuring correct 
alignment in the transverse direction of the semiconductor 
package and in a direction normal to the light-sensitive 
surface, the aforementioned joining devices comprise snap 
elements arranged on the holder and on the mounting plate and 
interacting with one another. A desired alignment accuracy tolerance between the optical
