<ABSTRACT>
A digital communication system including a Viterbi 
decoder for tracing a path through a trellis of individual state information and 

method of operation are disclosed. The traceback determines a decoded 
symbol. A trellis of branch origin data is stored in an array of registers (e.g., 

28). 
The branch origin data associated with a symbol instant is an update 

instruction form a digital signal process (DSP) (e.g., 20) to the coprocessor (e.g., 
30). 

A first predetermined traceback length is written to a traceback length 
register (e.g., 38). The first predetermined traceback length is small to 

minimize tracebacks cycling into branch origin data from a previous 
transmission burst. A traceback is initiated by the DSP (e.g., 20) 

providing the coprocessor (e.g., 30) a single traceback instruction. The Viterbi 
decoder alternates between update and traceback instructions. At a 

predetermined symbol instant, the traceback length is increased to a second 
predetermined length by over-writing the traceback length register (e.g., 38). 

The second predetermined length is selected relative to the predetermined 

symbol instant to assure tracebacks do not cycle into branch origin data from a 
previous transmission burst (e.g., 100). After all updates are complete, the 

update instruction is omitted and the traceback instruction repeatedly executed 
until all symbols from a transmission burst (e.g., 100) are decoded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of operating
a digital communication system.Radio waves propagate at the speed of light. In cellular radio
transmissions, a transmitted signal can arrive at a receiver at multiple times
due to refraction, diffraction or reflection. Refraction occurs when the path of
propagation of the transmitted signal bends to follow the curvature of the earth.
Diffraction occurs when the path of propagation passes around obstacles.
Reflection occurs when a transmitted signal bounces off of either the
atmosphere, or obstacles in the path of propagation such as terrain, water tanks
or buildings. Each of these phenomena can contribute to a multiplicity of
signals being received at the receiver. Each of these signals was initially the
originally transmitted signal. Each of the received signals is uniquely distorted
by the particular path it transverses. Each signal is received at slightly
different times due to the differences in the length of the path of propagation. If
the transmitter is mobile, such as a mobile cellular telephone, the received
signals vary. When the transmitted signal is digital symbols, intersymbol
interference occurs and may extend over several symbol time periods. The
receiver must reliably extract the transmitted signal from these various received
signals.Time division multiple access encoded information is transmitted in
multiple channels per carrier. In accordance with the Group Special Mobile
(GSM) standard, there are eight channels per carrier. Each channel is provided
a time slot of one-half millisecond. Each time slot provides a frame of bits,
sometimes called a transmission burst, during transmission. A portion of the
bits in each frame are set aside as a training segment for system use. The bits of
the training segment, or a portion of them, have been used as a means to adapt
the decoding process to compensate for channel characteristics. However, these
bits are received only once during each frame whereas the channel
characteristics can change over the entire time during which the frame is 
transmitted, such that the channel characteristics during the training segment
are not representative of the channel characteristics of the entire frame.A Viterbi decoder is a maximum likelihood decoder that provides
forward error correction. Viterbi decoding is used in decoding a sequence of
encoded symbols, such as a bit stream. The bit stream can represent encoded
information in telecommunication system transmission through various media
with each set of bits

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a digital communication system (10) including
a Viterbi decoder for tracing a path through a trellis of surviving branch data from

various symbol instants of a current transmission burst to determine decoded symbols,
the trellis being stored in an array of storage registers, the method including the steps of

initiating a traceback having a first predetermined length from a first symbol instant, the
traceback tracing a path back through the trellis of storage registers containing surviving

branch data to determine a decoded symbol, CHARACTERIZED BY

the first predetermined length being selected to be very short to reduce
cycling into storage registers of the array containing surviving branch data from a

previous transmission burst;
initiating a traceback having a first predetermined length from
subsequent symbol instants until a first predetermined symbol instant is reached;
discarding the decoded symbols at the end of this traceback operation;
increasing the traceback length from the first predetermined length to a
second predetermined length; and
initiating a traceback having a second predetermined length from the first
predetermined symbol instant.
A method as claimed in claim 1, including the steps of:

increasing the traceback length from the first predetermined length to a
third predetermined length at a second predetermined symbol instant, the third

predetermined length being between the first predetermined length and the second
predetermined length in magnitude, the second predetermined symbol instant being

between the first symbol instant and the first predetermined symbol instant;
initiating a traceback having a third predetermined length from the
second predetermined symbol instant;
initiating a traceback having a third predetermined length from
subsequent symbol instants until the first predetermined symbol instant is reached; and
increasing the traceback length from the third predetermined length to
the second predetermined length.
