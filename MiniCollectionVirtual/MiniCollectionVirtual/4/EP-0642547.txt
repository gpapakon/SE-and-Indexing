<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL CRYSTALLINE COMPOUNDS, THEIR USE, AND POLYMER COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THE SAMEThe present invention relates to novel crystalline compounds, their use and polymer compositions comprising the same. In particu¬ lar, the invention relates to thermosetting, thermoplastic or elastomeric polyme: compositions, comprising certain organic additives, which can impart electrical conductivity to the polymers or which can be applied as > Igments or as nucleating agents.Polymer compositions that are electrically conductive can be produced by incorporating conductive organic metallomacrocyclic compounds into the polymer matrix. Known metallomacrocyclic conduc- tors can be divi _d into two main groups: compounds that have enhanced conductivity becau of doping with i.a. halogen atoms, such as iodine ε i compounds that are intrinsically conductive without doping, Λ the literature (cf. Hanack et al, in the Text¬ book: "Conductive Polymers", Marcel Dekker publishers, 1986) conductors of the latter group are consistently referred to as being polymeric by nature.Metalloma ocyclic compounds based on phthalocyanine struc¬ tures may be divided into 3 groups: planar polymerized metallo- phthalocyanines such as poly(copper phthalocyanine) ; stacked metallomacrocycles with metal-metal bonding; or polymeric metallo- macrocycles with bridging ligands. Examples of the latter category are the conductive phthalocyanine polymers of the general formula (PcM.X) wherein Pc is phthalocyaninato, M is a metal such as Fe, Ru, Co, Mn, Cr or Rh a G is a bridging ligand such as CN or SCN. They have been studied ι_ x described amongst others by prof. Hanack's group in Tubingen (cf. J.E. Metz, thesis, University Tubingen, 1983; J.E. Me id M. Hanack, J.Am.Chem.Soc. , 105, 828 (1983); 0. Schneider ar Hanack, Z. Naturforsch. 39b, 265 (1984); and S. Deger, thesis, University Tubingen, 1986). The polymers developed by Prof. Hanack1s group are believed to be 

conductive by delocalization of pi-electrons along the polymer axis. Thus, the bridging ligands impart adequate conductivity levels as a result of which there is no need for subsequent doping. These polymers and their applications have also been subject of patent applications, such as DE-A-3,245,750 (claiming the poly¬ mers), EP-A-168,620 (claiming electrically conductive polymers or polymer blends), and EP-A-261,733 (claiming a process for preparing an electrically conductive polymer composition which comprises preparing a blend of a solution of an intrinsically conductive polymer and a
