<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel pyran
derivative, and more specifically, it relates to a
novel pyran derivative which has sensitivity to light
in a visible light range, particularly in a wavelength
range longer than green light and which can function as
a photosensitizer for a photopolymerizable or
photocrosslinkable photosensitive resin composition.Furthermore, the present invention relates to a
photopolymerizable and/or photocrosslinkable
photosensitive resin composition which can be
sensitized by the above-mentioned pyran derivative, and
a hologram medium in which this composition is used.In recent years, with the development of dye
lasers, various novel compounds have been synthesized
as laser dyes. Above all, 4H-pyrans can emit light
very efficiently in a wide range of 600 to 700 nm by
laser excitation, and therefore they have been
developed as dyes for a long-wavelength light zone dye
laser (USP 3,852,683). Thus, it is expected that these
dyes are applied to an EL display utilizing their
characteristics by which light is absorbed and 
fluorescence is emitted (USP 4,769,292).With regard to the application of these dyes to
photosensitive materials for electrophotography,
various investigations have been made, but they have
not been applied as sensitizers by which an electron or
energy is transferred to another compound.Heretofore, among the 4H-pyrans, a compound
represented by the formula (7) has been commercially
available:
The above-mentioned compound has an absorption
maximum at 481 nm in a dimethyl sulfoxide solution
[Optics Comm., 29, p. 331 (1979)], and it has
sensitivity to light having a wavelength of 488 nm from
an Ar laser but its sensitivity to light having a
wavelength of 514.5 nm is poor. In addition, this
compound scarcely exhibits the sensitivity to light
having a wavelength of 632.8 nm from an He-Ne laser
inconveniently. That is, in order to use the 4H-pyrans
as the sensitizers for the light having long
wavelengths, its absorption maximum is required to be 
shifted to a longer wavelength side, and it can be
considered that a contrivance such as the alteration of
substituents is necessary.Chemical Abstract, Vol. 117, No. 4, 1992, Abstract No. 36670s
and JP-A-0414083 disclose hologram recording material containing
polyvinylcarbazole and 4-(dicyanomethylene) -2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran
as a photosensitizer and a
radical-generating photoreaction initiator. The material shows
good humidity resistance and high sensitivity for Ar laser (460
to 520 nm).Therefore,
