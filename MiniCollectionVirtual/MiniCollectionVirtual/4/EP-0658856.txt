<ABSTRACT>
An output control apparatus which delivers a 
character pattern in accordance with a character 

generating request from a host computer and which 
selects one of a plurality of fonts in accordance with 

data designated by the host computer, comprising means 
of selecting a font of characters to be outputted in 

accordance with an attribute thereof, memory means for 
storing therein a plurality of font data and a 

plurality of font scalers, means for setting degrees of 
priority of the plurality of font scalers, and means 

for selecting a font of characters to be outputted in 
accordance with a degree of priority set by the setting 

means at the time when said font of characters to be 
outputted is selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a character processor
apparatus for outputting a character pattern in
response to a character generating request delivered
from a host computer, and in particular to an output
device having a plurality of fonts, for selecting a
font of characters in accordance with data designated
by the host computer.These years, an electrophotographing type printing
device such as a laser printer incorporates in general
a plurality of fonts, from which a font to be used by a
host computer is selected and set by a printer command,
at a panel, etc., and is then printed. As such a
method of selecting a font, a method of designating a
name of a font, and a method of selecting a font in
accordance with an attribute of a font are used.The above-mentioned font selecting method in
accordance with an attribute of a font, comprises the
steps of: providing a plurality of attributes of fonts,
and storing data for these attributes in tables (font
tables) each for each font, and dropping out fonts
having attributes different from a designated
attribute, in the order of descending priority so as to 
select a finally remaining font.Explanation will be hereinbelow made of a prior
art example relating to the present invention with
reference to the drawings. Fig. 14 is a block diagram
explaining the constitution of a printing device of
this kind.Referring to this figure, a printing device 100 in
this prior art example, is adapted to prepare a printed
result 200 in accordance with printing data delivered
from a host computer 300.The printing device 100 incorporates therein a CPU
for 101 for controlling the operation of the printing
device in its entirety, and other components which will
be hereinbelow explained.A receiving buffer 108 temporarily stores therein
data from the host computer 300, and a font memory 102
stores therein outline font data (which may be
stroke type font data). Further, a font table 103 has
attributes of incorporated fonts, and pointers for
pattern data in the form of a table, a page buffer
memory 104 for storing therein received data, a bit map
memory 105 for developing image data for a one page,
and a printer engine part for actually carrying out
printing in accordance with the image data developed in
the bit map memory 105.Referring to Fig. 15 which is a view showing the
data structure of the font table 103 shown in Fig. 14, 
the font table 103 is composed of all names of fonts
included in the printing device, attributes, pointers
and flags. Incorporated fonts, fonts in font

<CLAIMS>
A character processing apparatus comprising:

selection means (101) operable to select one of a

plurality of fonts in accordance with a designated
attribute; and
development means (101) operable to develop a
character pattern as bit data in an output memory using

the font selected by said selection means and a scaler
corresponding to the selected font,

characterised by further comprising
memory means (2) for storing definition information
defining a priority of scalers used for respective fonts;

and wherein the selection means is operable such that,
when there are at least two fonts corresponding to
different scalers but having the same attributes except

for the scalers, said selection means selects one of the
at least two fonts corresponding to the scaler with the

highest priority in accordance with the definition
information stored in said memory means (101).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising
output means (107) operable to output the character

pattern from the output memory.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said output
means comprises a printer engine. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the attributes include a graphic set, pitch, size, style,

stroke, type face and auxiliary type face.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the definition information comprises scaler levels stored

for respective scalers.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein said memory
means comprises a scaler information table.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein in said
scaler information table, scaler indexes are assigned to

the scalers in descending order of scaler level.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein said
selection means is operable to select from the plurality

of fonts a selected font having the smallest scaler
index.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
a graphic set, pitch, size, style, stroke, type face and

auxiliary type face are assigned priority in this
sequential order as the attributes, and said selection

means is operable to select one of the plurality of fonts
in accordance with one attribute selected from the

attributes in that sequential order. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, further
comprising change means (109) operable to change the

output memory using the font selected in said selecting

step and a scaler corresponding to the selected font,

characterised in that
when there are at least two fonts corresponding to
different scalers but having the same attributes except

for the scalers, said selecting step selects one of the
at least two fonts corresponding to the scaler with the

highest priority in accordance with prestored definition
