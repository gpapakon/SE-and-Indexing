<ABSTRACT>
Assay for detecting nucleic acid sequence, which 
comprises the steps: [A]
 contacting (1) a target single-stranded 
nucleic acid, (2) a pair of nucleic acid primers 

having nucleotide sequence complementary to the target nucleic 
acid and its complementary chain respectively, (3) a fluorescent-labeled 

nucleic acid probe which has a nucleotide sequence 
designed so as to be hybridized to the target nucleic acid 

downstream (at the side of 3'-terminus) from where the nucleic 
acid primer is hybridized and has a modified 3'-end so that the 

nucleotide chain is not elongated by a nucleic acid polymerase, 
and (4) a nucleic acid polymerase having exonuclease activity 

specific to a double-stranded nucleic acid in the presence of 
substrates for the enzyme (four kinds of nucleoside triphosphate), 

and thereby elongating the said nucleic acid primer 
chain and simultaneously hydrolyzing only the fluorescent-labeled 

nucleic acid probe hybridized to the target nucleic 
acid; [B]
 denaturating the chain-elongated product of primer to 
a single-stranded form; [C]
 amplifying the target nucleic acid 
by repeating the steps A and B; and [D]
 determining the change 
in fluorescence polarization resulted by the hydrolysis of the 

probe. This method is effective to detect the target nucleic 
acid sequence more simply with higher sensitivity and higher 

reliability in comparison with known methods, and further has 
advantages that because of no carryover or contamination of the 

amplified nucleic acids into subsequent reactions, undesirable 
false positive result can be avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assay method for 
detecting a nucleic acid sequence, which is useful for 
diagnosis of infectious diseases caused by microorganisms such 
as bacteria, virus and the like. In diagnosis of diseases induced by change of gene 
such as hereditary diseases, or diseases induced by exogenous 
gene such as virus DNA, it is useful to detect directly the 
abnormal gene or the exogenous gene in addition to the clinical 
observation of the patients, biochemical test or culture test 
of the sample obtained from the patients. Direct detection of 
DNAs or RNAs having specific nucleotide sequence become 
possible owing to the recent establishment of genetic 
engineering technique which has comparatively good reproducibility 
and also the development of various nucleic acid 
probes, and it has been studied to apply such a direct 
detection of DNAs or RNAs to clinical diagnosis of diseases. The assay for the presence of a gene having a specific 
nucleotide sequence in a test sample has hitherto been done by 
a dot blotting method which comprises denaturating an extracted 
polynucleotide component to a single-stranded form by treating 
it with an alkali (e.g. sodium hydroxide) or by subjecting it 
to heat treatment, immobilizing the resultant onto a 
nitrocellulose membrane, hybridizing it with a nucleic acid 
probe labeled with a marker such as a radioactive isotope (RI),  
 
biotin, etc. and then detecting the hybridized product. 
However, said method requires very complicated procedures such 
as immobilization of the polynucleotide component, removal of 
unhybridized probe (B/F separation) after the hybridization, 
and hence, it is very difficult to treat a plenty of test 
samples at one time. Recently, some improved methods eliminating the above 
problems have been proposed, for example, a method comprising 
hybridizing the target DNA with a fluorescent-labeled DNA probe 
and determining the change in fluorescence polarization (i.e. 
increase in the fluorescence anisotropy) owing to increase in 
apparent molecular weight (cf. Japanese Patent First Publication 
(Kokai) No. 75958/1990), and a method comprising treating 
a double-stranded DNA formed from a fluorescent-labeled DNA 
probe and a target DNA with a Î»-exonuclease to hydrolyze only 
the hybridized probe and determining the change in fluorescence 
polarization owing to decrease in molecular weight of the 
labeled probe (cf. International Patent Publication 
WO91/17264). However, these methods have still a problem of 
less sensitivity
