<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to hot melt
adhesive compositions; more particularly the present
invention application is directed to improvements in
hot melt adhesive compositions comprising low molecular
weight ethylene copolymers having improved adhesive
properties to a variety of substrate materials of both
polar and non-polar characteristics.As is known to the art, conventional hot melt
adhesive compositions typically comprise three primary
constitutents; a base polymer which provides adhesion
and toughness to the adhesive in its cooled state, a
waxy material which acts to initiate the setting and
solidification of the heated adhesive composition and
to further minimize the viscosity, and a tackifying
constituent which enhances the wetting and adhesion of
the composition to the sufaces upon which it is
applied. Ideally, a hot melt adhesive composition is
useful for bonding a wide variety of substrates,
including polar substrates such as metals,
polycarbonates, polyesters including polyethylene
terephthalate ("PET"), as well as haloganeated polymer
compositions, including PVC, and further, nonpolar
substrates such as polyolefins, including polyethylene
and polypropylene. Further, such hot melt adhesive
compostiions exhibit good compatability of their 
individual constituents. The prior art proposes
various solutions to these problems.U.S. Patent 5,037,874 to Nuttens et al. a
compatibile wax which comprises a synthetic
polyethylene wax which includes incorporated carbon
monoxide ("CO") terminal groups and a method for it
production. The advantage cited by the reference
includes a novel process for the production of the
synthetic polyethyelene wax, and its compatability with
conventional hot melt adhesive compositions.US Patent 4,601,948 to Lancaster provides adhesive
compositions which are used in bonding materials
utilizing high frequency radiation; the adhesives
therein include ethylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and
terpolymers which are cited as having melt indicies of
0.5-2500, which are expected to be relatively higher
weight materials.US Patents 4,880,904 and 4,871,618 to Kinneberg
provide adhesive compositions and laminated structures
which consist essentially of a linear alternating
polymer which is heat curable, and which is preferably
of a number average molecular weight of the range of
10,000 to 30,000.A paper entitled "Ethylene Copolymer for Adhesion
to Plastics" by E. McBride and presented at an Adhesive
and Sealant Council Seminar on April 16, 1991 describes
hot melt adhesive systems
