<DESCRIPTION>
 DRY-CLEANING KIT FOR IN-DRYER USEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a laundry- cleaning sheet comprising a gelled solvent-based dry- cleaning composition and a method for use of the cleaning sheet in kit form. The invention particularly relates to a method for use of the dry-cleaning kit to freshen and/or dry-clean spotted or stained fabrics such as clothes. More particularly, the present invention relates to such a method of dry cleaning that can be carried out in the home in a rotary clothes dryer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMethods for dry-cleaning fabrics commonly employ organic solvents which can readily dissolve or disperse soils such as water-insoluble substances, including greases, oily dirts and the like, and which exhibit low solvent boiling points, enabling easy recovery of the solvents.The use of solvent-based dry-cleaning methods has, however, been primarily limited to commercial cleaning operations which employ expensive specialized equipment. Such equipment includes stills with condensers to contain vapors from the cleaning solvents, which are often toxic. As a result, to utilize such dry-cleaning processes, particularly to remove water- insoluble spots and/or stains from clothes, the user must bring the clothes to a specialized dry-cleaning establishment and pick up the cleaned clothes at a later date. This results in inconvenient expenditures of time in going to the dry-cleaner, waiting for the clothes to be properly cleaned, picking up the clothes, and dealing with damaged and lost articles of clothing. Moreover, articles of clothing from many different people are dry- 

cleaned with the same batch of solvent, which can result in malodorous residues.A process for home dry-cleaning clothing is disclosed by S. Denissenko et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,336,024, wherein the soiled areas are pre-treated with a liquid cleaning composition. The clothing is then attached to an absorbent sheet and spun using the spin cycle of a washing machine, so that the cleaning composition and the soil are driven through the clothing and into the absorbent sheet. It is also disclosed that the absorbent sheet can be integrally sealed onto a plastic sheet, so that the clothing can be enclosed by the sheet while it is spun in a washing machine. See Col. 11, line 28 to Col. 12, line 40 and claim 1. It is therefore an object of. the invention to provide a solvent-based dry-cleaning composition and a method of use therefor which can be conducted at home without having to take soiled or

2. The fabric-cleaning article of claim 1 wherein the organic solvent comprises a glycol ether.
3. The fabric-cleaning article of claim 1 wherein the surfactant includes a least one nonionic surfactant.
4. The fabric-cleaning article of claim 1 wherein the substrate sheet is a non-woven fabric sheet.
5. The fabric-cleaning article of claim 1 wherein the gelling agent is an organic gum.
6. The fabric-cleaning sheet of claim 5 wherein the organic gum is carrageenan.
7. The f bric cleaning sheet of claim 6 wherein the cleaning composition further comprises about 0.0025-0.075% of an alkali metal halide.
8. A fabric-cleaning kit comprising, packaged in association,
(a) at least one plastic bag having an opening comprising a fastening system so that the bag can enclose in a vapor-impermeable manner, a soiled fabric, and 


 (b) at least one fabric-cleaning article comprising a porous substrate sheet stably impregnated with a gelled cleaning composition consisting essentially of a liquid vehicle selected from the group consisting of water, a water-miscible organic solvent and mixtures thereof, an effective amount of a gelling agent, and about 0.5-5% surfactant, wherein said cleaning article is separately packaged in a moisture-impermeable envelope.
9. The kit of claim 8 wherein said fastening system consists of press-studs, clips, a zipper, a Velcro strip, a Zip-lock seal or opposed strips of resealable adhesive.
10. The kit of claim 8 wherein said plastic consists of polypropylene, polyethylene or polyamide.
11. The kit of claim 8 wherein the liquid vehicle contains about 60-90% water.
12. The kit of claim 11 wherein the liquid vehicle contains about 5-25% water-miscible organic solvent.
13. The kit of claim 11 wherein the organic solvent includes a glycol ether.
14. The kit of claim 8 wherein the substrate sheet consists of fabric, paper or foam.
15. The kit of claim 8 which the cleaning composition comprises about 0.25-5% gelling agent. 


16. The kit of claim 15 wherein the gelling agent is an organic gum.
17. The kit of claim 16 wherein the gelling agent is a carrageenan.
18. The kit of claim 16 wherein the gelled cleaning composition comprises about 0.0025-0.1% of an alkali metal salt.
19. The kit of claim 8 wherein the soiled fabric is an article of clothing.
20. A process for cleaning a soiled fabric article with a cleaning composition, said process com¬ prising:
