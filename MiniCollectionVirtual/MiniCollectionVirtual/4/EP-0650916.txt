<ABSTRACT>
A hoistway door (18) and a car door (22) are 
coupled by means of a vane (164) attached to the 

hoistway door, and a mating channel (166) mounted to the 
car door. A mechanism (194) allows the channel to 

extend from its mounting towards the vane if the car is 
preparing to load or unload passengers, whereby the vane 

enters the channel to couple the car and hoistway doors 
for motion together. if the car is in motion the 

mechanism causes the channel to move towards its 
mounting and away from the vane so that the channel does 

not interfere with any vanes on any floor that is passed 
while in the car is in motion. The channel allows the 

vane attached thereto, to slightly ascend and descend 
while still coupled to the channel. The mounting has a 

spring (194) that bends to move the channel away from 
the vane and unbends to move the channel towards the 

vane. The channel releases a lock (30) attached to the 
hoistway door as the channel moves away from its 

mounting to allow the hoistway door to open as the car 
doors open.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to elevator doors generally 
and to an elevator hoistway and car door lock and 
coupling particularly. Elevators doors are configured in basically the 
same ways: each elevator car has one or more center or 
side opening doors to protect passengers as the car 
moves; and each landing has one or more hoistway doors 
that are configured similarly to the car doors to 
prevent passengers from entering the hoistway when the 
car is not at the landing. The hoistway and car doors are opened and closed by 
a door operating unit. The unit is disposed atop an 
elevator car and is attached to each car door via a 
complicated mechanical linkage. Each car door, in turn, 
is coupled, at the proper time, by a pair of rollers 
that clamp a vane attached to the hoistway doors. Hoistway doors are locked when the elevator is not 
at the landing to prevent passengers from entering the 
hoistway. If the elevator car is at the landing and is 
preparing to load or discharge passengers, the hoistway 
doors must be unlocked. The door operating unit lowers 
a retiring cam that engages and rotates a linkage to 
unlock the hoistway doors. Viewed from one aspect the present invention 
provides apparatus for coupling a hoistway door and a 
car door in an elevator, comprising:
 
   a vane fixedly attached to one of said hoistway 
door and said car door,
 
   a channel disposed upon the other of said hoistway 
door and said car door, said channel allowing said vane 
to ascend and descend therein as the doors open and 
close if said vane is disposed within said channel, and
 
   means to extend the channel away from said other of  
 
said hoistway door and said car door and into engagement 
with said vane if it is desired to open said hoistway 
door and said car door. Thus in a preferred embodiment of the invention the 
hoistway and car doors are coupled by means of a vane 
attached to one of the hoistway door and car door and a 
mating channel mounted to the other of the hoistway door 
and car door. A mechanism allows the channel to extend 
from its mounting towards the vane if the car is 
preparing to load or unload passengers. The vane enters 
the channel to couple the car and hoistway doors for 
motion together. If the car is in motion the mechanism 
causes the channel to move towards its mounting and away 
from the vane so that the channel does not interfere 
with any vanes on any floor that is passed while in the 
car is in motion. The channel allows the vane attached 
thereto, to slightly ascend and

Apparatus for coupling a hoistway door (18) and a 
car door (22) in an elevator, comprising: 

   a vane (164) fixedly attached to one of said 
hoistway door and said car door, 

   a channel (166) disposed upon the other of said 
hoistway door and said car door, said channel allowing 

said vane to ascend and descend therein as the doors 
open and close if said vane is disposed within said 

channel, and 
   means (194) to extend the channel away 
from said 
other of said hoistway door and said car door and into 

engagement with said vane if it is desired to open said 
hoistway door and said car door. 
The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising: 
   means (196;200) to disengage said channel (166) 

from said vane (164). 
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein said means to 
disengage said channel (166) comprises: 

   a door operator means (14) for closing said car 
door (22) and for engaging said channel and moving said 

channel towards said other of said hoistway door (18) 
and said car door. 
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said 
means to extend the channel (166) comprises; 

   a bending member (194), said member unbending to 
force said channel into engagement with said vane (164). 
The apparatus of claim 4 further comprising: 
   means (196;200) to bend said bendable member (194)
