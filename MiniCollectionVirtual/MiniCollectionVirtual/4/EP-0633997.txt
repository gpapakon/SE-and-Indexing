<ABSTRACT>
A rapid thermal process (RTP) reactor (200, 220)  processes a plurality of wafers (210) or a single large wafer (250) using either a single (204) or dual (204, 224) heat source. The wafers (210) or wafer (250) are mounted on a rotatable susceptor (201, 241) supported by a susceptor support (212). A susceptor position control (202) rotates the wafers (204) during processing and raises and lowers the susceptor (201, 241) to various positions. A heat controller (203) controls the heat source (204, 224) that heats the wafers. A gas flow controller (205) regulates flow of gases into the reaction chamber (209). Instead of the second heat source (224), a passive heat distribution element (307) can be used. Further a susceptor (1102) is used that includes a wafer surround ring (1101a, 1101b, 1101c) around the wafer and, in some embodiments, a susceptor insert (1417) underneath the wafer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to processing
semiconductor wafers, and, in particular, to a method and
apparatus for rapid thermal processing of a plurality of
semiconductor wafers simultaneously and of a single large
semiconductor wafer.Deposition of a film on the surface of a
semiconductor wafer is a common step in semiconductor
processing. Typically, selected chemical gases are mixed
in a deposition chamber containing a semiconductor wafer.
Usually, heat is applied to drive the chemical reaction of
the gases in the chamber and to heat the surface of the
wafer on which the film is deposited.In deposition processes, it is desirable to maximize
wafer throughput (i.e., the number of wafers processed per
unit time), while depositing film layers that have uniform
thickness and resistivity. To obtain uniform thickness
and resistivity, it is important to maintain the wafer at
a uniform temperature.A number of different deposition reactors have been
developed. Generally, each deposition reactor has a
reaction chamber, a wafer handling system, a heat source
and temperature control, and a gas delivery system (inlet,
exhaust, flow control).FIG. 1A is a simplified cross-sectional view of one
type of prior art deposition reactor 100, known as a
horizontal furnace, in which susceptor 101 is positioned
in horizontal tube 102 (usually of rectangular cross-section),
the interior of which is the reaction chamber. 
Semiconductor wafers 103a, 103b and 103c are mounted on
surface 101a of susceptor 101. Heat source 104 heats the
wafers, and reactant gases 105 are flowed through tube 102
past the wafers. Susceptor 101 is often tilted, as shown
in FIG. 1A, so that surface 101a faces into the flow of
reactant gases 105 to minimize the problem of reactant
depletion in the vicinity of the wafers near the end of
the flow of reactant gases 105.FIG. 1B is a simplified orthogonal view of another
type of prior art reactor 110, known as a barrel reactor,
in which susceptor 111 is suspended in the interior of
bell jar 112 which defines the reaction chamber.
Semiconductor wafers, e.g., wafer 113, are mounted
substantially vertically on the sides, e.g., side 111a, of
susceptor 111. Heat source 114 heats the wafers, and
reactant gases are introduced through gas inlet 115 into
the top of bell jar 112. The gases pass down the length
of susceptor 111, over the surfaces of the wafers, and are
exhausted from the reaction chamber through a gas outlet
(not shown) at the bottom of bell jar 112.FIG. 1C is a simplified cross-sectional view of
