<ABSTRACT>
A method for combustion of combustible material 
comprising carbonaceous fuel and plastic material with an 

oxygen containing gas and possibly also a moderator gas, 
which are fed to and through a burner separately and 

wherein the feed of plastic material feed is subjected to 
heating. 
A burner for the combustion of combustible material with an 
oxygen containing gas in a combustion zone comprising a 

central channel and outlet for supplying a solid, combustible 
material to the combustion zone,

 
at least one first substantially annular channel disposed 

coaxially with said central channel and having an outlet to 
supply an oxidant gas flow to the combustion zone,

 
a second annular channel being disposed coaxially with said 

central channel and located outside said first annular 
channel, the central channel being connected to a supply of 

finely divided solid plastic waste material, and the second 
annular channel being connected to a supply of 

carbonaceous fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for combustion of combustible 
material comprising carbonacious fuel and plastic material with an 
oxygen containing gas and also a moderator gas. Such a method is known from EP-A-328794.
 
According to this known method fuel is mixed with the oxygen 
containing gas and thereupon burned. As such this is a satisfactory 
process. However if special fuel has to be buerned, such as pulverized 
or granulated waste plastic material, this fuel can not be burned so 
easily, especially not when the production of contaminating gas or 
ashes have to be avoided and the combustion must be as complete as 
possible. It is therefor an object of the invention to provide a method wherein 
these problems can be avoided.
 
This object is achieved in that the carboniceous fuel and the plastic 
material is subjected to heating.
 
By separating the supply of the fuel and the plastic material, the 
ignition of the plastic materisl is somewhat delayed with respect to the  
 
ignition of the fuel, whereby an improved burning is botained. This 
can be explained by the fact that the plastic material is additionally 
preheated in the flame before its ignition starts whereby higher 
temperatures are present during the burning, thereby avoiding 
production of unwanted by-products. The invention also relates to a burner for preforming the method 
comprising a central channel and outlet for supplying a solid 
combustible material to the combustion zone and at least one first 
substantially annular channel disposed coaxially with said central 
channel and having an outlet to supply an oxidant gas flow to the 
combustion zone. In this known device at the outlet of the channels the fuel is mixed 
with the oxygen containing gas and burned.
 
Mixing the two substances, fuel and plastic waste before burning will 
generally cause problems in the transport of the mterials. It is an object of the invention to provide a burner these problems are 
avoided. This object is achieved in that a second annular channel is provided 
disposed coaxially with said central channel and located outside said 
first annular channel, the central channel being connected to a supply 
of finely divided solid plastic material and the second annular channel 
being connected to a supply of carbonaceous fuel. By separating the supply of the primary (carbonaceous) fuel and  
 
secondary (plastic) fuel, the transport problems can be overcome. 
Moreover it provides the possibility to introduce the different fuels at 
different temperatures
