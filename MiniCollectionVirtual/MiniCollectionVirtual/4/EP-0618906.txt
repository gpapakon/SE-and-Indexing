Processes for the preparation of these compounds are described, as are novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one of the compounds or their salts. The compounds and their non-toxic salts exhibit valuable pharmacological activity and are highly selective and long acting antagonists at a2-adrenoceptors. Their peroral bioavailability is good. The compounds are especially useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 4(5)-substituted imidazole
derivatives and their non-toxic salts, to their preparation, to
pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their use.The imidazole derivatives of this invention have the general formula:

wherein
Y is -CH2- or -CO-R1 is F, Cl or OH; R2 is H, F or Cl; and R3 is H, CH3 or CH2CH3 and
pharmaceutically acceptable thereof, excluding 4-(5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-1H-imidazole
and 4-(4-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-1H-imidazole.The most preferable compounds according to the present invention are
those wherein R1 is F, R2 is hydrogen or F, especially hydrogen. Also
preferable are compounds, wherein R3 is hydrogen or CH2CH3 and Y is
-CH2-. As specific examples of such preferred compounds are
mentioned 4-(2-ethyl-5-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-1H-imidazole
and 4-(5-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-1H-imidazole.
These compounds are also valuable intermediates for the preparation of
disubstituted indan-imidazole derivatives according to the invention.The compounds of this invention are highly selective and long-acting
antagonists of α2-adrenoceptors and they have good peroral
bioavailability. The compounds are especially valuable in the treatment
of cognitive disorders.Valuable α2-adrenoceptor antagonists have been disclosed earlier e.g.
in the European patent publications No. 183492, 247764 and 372954.
PCT patent application No. 91/18886 discloses the use of some indenimidazole
derivatives, especially atipamezole, in the treatment of agerelated
memory impairment and other cognitive disorders. The
compounds disclosed in these earlier patent applications, though some
of them are very potent and selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonists, 
compounds with longer duration of action and good peroral
bioavailability are necessary to obtain sufficient patient compliance.
There are also indan-imidazole derivatives which have reported to have
long duration of action e.g. those disclosed in EP 372954. However, such
compounds are not so potent α2-adrenoceptor antagonists as the
compounds of the present invention.α-Adrenoceptors can be divided on a pharmacological basis into two
subclasses, viz α1 -and α2-adrenoceptors (see e.g. Starke & Docherty, J.
Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., I, Suppl. 1, 514-523, 1981). It is well
established that while α1-adrenoceptors are located postsynaptically,
α2-adrenoceptors are situated both at presynaptic nerve terminals and
postsynaptically e.g. in vascular smooth muscle, platelets, pancreatic
β-cells, fat cells
