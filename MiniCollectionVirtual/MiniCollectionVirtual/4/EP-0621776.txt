Readily injectable collagen-based composition, characterized in 
that it comprises microcapsules of atelocollagen with a polysaccharide, in 

particular a glycosaminoglycan, in suspension in a viscous biocompatible 
carrier solution, with the microcapsules together with the viscous carrier 

solution having a viscosity enabling said composition to be injected from a 
needle. 
Composition according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
carrier solution comprises at least a protein substance such as 

atelocollagen, and/or a polysaccharide substance. 
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
carrier solution comprises a protein substance selected among the 

atelocollagen preferably obtained by chemical treatment, notably with soda. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the atelocollagen of the microcapsules is decrosslinked with a 

decrosslinking rate adapted to the proposed application. 
Composition according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in 
that the polysaccharide substance of the carrier solution is selected among 

a glycosaminoglycan, an alginate, a dextran, a cellulose or a cellulose 
derivative, a xanthan gum, a gum arabic and a mixture or mixtures thereof. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the microcapsules are produced from atelocollagen or from a mixture of 

atelocollagen and polysaccharide crosslinked, the polysaccharide being 
preferably selected among a structural glycosaminoglycan selected among 

the group consisting of chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, 
dermatan-sulfate, heparan-sulfate, keratan-sulfate, as well as heparin and 

its derivatives in particular heparins of low molecular weight having a 
molecular weight comprised between about 2,000 and about 10,000 and a 

polyholoside, in particular dextran. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the relative proportion by weight/volume of the microcapsules with 

respect to the carrier solution is comprised between 0.5 and 15% by weight 
of microcapsules with respect to the volume of the carrier solution.  

 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the proportion by weight of polysaccharides in the microcapsules with 

respect to the atelocollagen is comprised between 10 and 70%. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that the microcapsules contain at least an active substance which is, either 

encapsulated within, or in the mass of the walls of the microcapsules, or 
grafted on the inner and/or outer surface, said active substance being 

preferably a biologically, cosmetically or pharmaceutically active substance. 
Composition according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the size of the microcapsules is less than about 

500 µm. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in 
that the microcapsules are produced from atelocollagen or from a mixture of 

atelocollagen with a glycosaminoglycan, in particular chondroitin-4-sulfate, 
and they contain granules of hydroxyapatite; and the carrier solution is 

produced from a gel of atelocollagen optionally mixed with a 
glycosaminoglycan, in particular chondroitin-4-sulfate. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in 
that the collagen content of said composition is at least 7% by 

weight/volume and preferably about 10% by weight/volume. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in 
that the degradation of microcapsules is modulated by adjusting the rate of 

interfacial crosslinking and/or by a variable rate of atelocollagen 
decrosslinking by chemical or enzymatic means. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in 
that said viscous biocompatible carrier solution is adapted to the 

physiological conditions of pH and osmotic pressure, preferably having a pH 
comprised between 6.8 and 7.5 and an osmotic pressure comprised 

between 260 and 320 mOsm/l H₂O, particularly by adjusting with a 
phosphate buffer or a mixture of phosphate buffer and sodium chloride. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterized in 
that the microcapsules together with the viscous carrier solution have a 

viscosity enabling sad composition to be injected in the form of a 
continuous thread from a needle, even a fine needle, having a diameter of 

about 0.3 to 0.5 mm.  
 
Use of the composition such as defined according to any one of 
claims 1 to 15, as a vector age
nt for an active substance, in particular for a 
biologically, cosmetically or pharmaceutically active substance. 
Use of the composition according to any one of claims 1 to 15, 
as filling-in material, in particular for soft or bone tissues, in particular 

having a stability in vivo at least equal to that of the collagen materials 
treated with glutaraldehyde. 
Pharmaceutical composition, characterized in that it comprises a 
collagen-based composition such as defined in any one of claims 1 to 15. 
Filling-in-material, characterized in that it was prepared from a 
collagen-based composition, such as defined in any one of claims 1 to 15.
