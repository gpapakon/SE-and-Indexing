<ABSTRACT>
The hinge is for door leaves on a piece of furniture including an angle between them when shut, one of them being attached to the main body. An angular arm is fixed to a support plate on one of the leaves, and is coupled at its free end to an arm pivoting on the other leaf. The arm (6') fixed to the plate (7') is a standard one as used in a conventional double-joint hinge. A component (10) fixed to it hinges on the pivoting arm (18). Fixing can be by two dowels fitting in holes drilled in the component and the fixed arm. The plate to which the latter is fixed can be of standard design, allowing arm adjustment in one direction at least.

Hinge (3) for the articulated junction of two wings (1, 2) of a folding door which, 
in their closed position, assume an angled position in respect of one another, 

and of which one wing (2) is attached to a body component (5) of an item of 
furniture or similar, 


consisting of an angled hinge arm (6, 10) which may be fixed to one wing (1) 
and which is fixed on a mounting plate (7, 7'), and 
of a second hinge element (18) which can be fixed to the other wing (2), to 
which hinge element (18) the free end of the hinge arm (6, 10) is pivot 

mounted, 
with the angled hinge arm (6, 10) being angled in the slewing plane of the 
hinge (3) so that the link pin (17) connecting said angled hinge arm (6, 10) to 

the hinge element (18), which may be fixed to the other wing (2), runs 
transverse to said hinge arm (6,10), 
characterised in that
the angled hinge arm (6, 10) consists of a straight section (6) which may be 
fixed to the mounting plate (7, 7'), and of an angled articulation section (10), 
the straight section (6) of the hinge arm (6, 10) corresponds to a double link 
hinge, and 
the articulated section (10) is connected to the straight section (6, 6') by two 
pins which pass through the link holes (8, 9) of the straight section (6, 6') and 

holes (14, 15) flush-aligned to these of the articulated section (10). 
Hinge according to Claim 1, characterised in that the hinge arm (6) is fitted to a 
mounting plate (7) which facilitates the adjustment of the hinge arm in at least 

one direction. 
Hinge according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the articulated section 
(10) is mounted in a cup-shaped hinge element. 
Hinge according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the articulated 
section (10) is pivot mounted on a single axis of articulation (17). 
Hinge according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the articulated 
section (10) is provided with a plastic stop attachment (20) which rests on one 

wing. 
Hinge according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the articulated 
section (10) is provided with a curved element (26) which is concentric to the 

pivot axis (17), and a further curve element (28) adjoining this via an outwardly 
directed step (27), on which curved sections (26, 28) is guided a spring-loaded 

pin (30) arranged parallel to the pivot axis (17), which in the angled closing 
range of the wings (1, 2) rests against the step (27) such that the wings (1, 2) 

are spread in the direction of their angled closed position. 
Hinge according to Claim 6, characterised in that the pin (30) is retained by the 
curved end of a bent leaf spring (31), the other curved end (32) of which is 

fixed in a slot (33) of the slewing hinge element (18), and is guided in oblong 
holes (40) in the side walls of the slewing hinge element (18).
