<ABSTRACT>
The shaft component for a joint endoprosthesis to be implanted in a long bone has a hollow cylindrical, rotationally symmetrical anchoring part (2) with a longitudinal axis (1) and an articulation part (3). The articulation part (3) is designed as a separate part which may be detachably secured to the anchoring part (2). The articulation part (3) has a substantially rotationally symmetrical base body (31), an axis of rotation (32) and an extension (33) which is eccentrically arranged with respect to the base body (31) and wich forms an  alpha  angle of 70 DEG  with the axis of rotation (32) for receiving a joint ball (36). The articulation part (3) may be set and secured with its base body (31) on the anchoring part (2) so that its axis of rotation (32) coincides with the longitudinal axis (1). The articulation part (3) may be detachably fastened on the anchoring part (2) in any desired angular position with respect to the longitudinal axis (1) of the latter, so that the radial orientation of the extension (33) may be selectively varied for adjusting anterior torsion with respect to the anchoring part (2).

sub-assembly (3), whereby 


A) the articulating sub-assembly (3) is a separate sub-assembly 
detachably affixed to the anchoring sub-assembly (2); 
B) the articulating sub-assembly (3) comprises an essentially 
rotationally symmetric base element (31), an axis of rotation 

(32) and a neck extension (33) mounted eccentrically relative to 
the base element (31) and subtending an angle α less than 90° 

with the axis of rotation (32) and serving to receive a 
joint-ball (36); 
C) the articulating sub-assembly (3) can be so mounted by means 
of its base element (31) on the anchoring sub-assembly (2) and 

be so fixed in place that its axis of rotation (32) coincides 
with the longitudinal axis (1); 
D) the articulating sub-assembly (3) is detachably fixable to 
the anchoring sub-assembly (2) in any angular position relative 

to the longitudinal axis (1) onto said anchoring sub-assembly  

 
(2), so that the radial direction of the neck extension (33) 

adjusting the anterior torsion relative to the anchoring 
sub-assembly (2) is selectively adjustable; and 
E) the anchoring sub-assembly (2) is substantially rotationally 
symmetric,
characterized in that
F) the anchoring sub-assembly (2) widens in the direction toward 
the articulating sub-assembly (3) in the form of coaxial, hollow 

cylindrical segments; and 
G) the anchoring sub-assembly (2) is provided with perforations 
(27).
