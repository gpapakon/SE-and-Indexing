<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an electrophotographically developing toner composition for
developing electrostatic images in electronic photography,
electrostatic recording, electrostatic printing, etc.As described in US Patent specifications Nos. 2297691,
2357809, etc., the electrophotographic process in the prior
art comprises uniformly charging a photoconductive insulation
layer, exposing the layer, eliminating electric charges
on the exposed area thereby forming electric latent images,
visualizing the latent images by depositing electrically
charged fine powder referred to as toners to the latent
images (developing step), transferring the thus obtained
visual images to transfer material such as transfer paper
(transfer step) and, thereafter, permanently fixing them 
by heating, pressurizing or like other adequate fixing
process (fixing step).In this way, toners have to provide functions required
not only in the developing step but in each of the transferring
and fixing steps.By the way, as the photosensitive material for copying
machines, printers, etc. adopting electrophotographic
process, those using organic photosensitive materials in
addition to conventional inorganic materials (amorphous
selenium alloy, cadmium sulfide, etc.) have been increased
in recent years. This is due to easy manufacture, reduced
cost, non-toxicity, etc. of the organic photosensitive
material.Most of the organic photosensitive materials require
in view of their properties those toners having positively
charged property and, further, development of positively
charged toners at high performance has keenly been demanded
due to the increased use of laser beam printers or the
likes that conduct reversing development although the
inorganic photosensitive materials are used.A toner comprising a pigment, a charge-controlling
agent and as a binder a vinyl polymer such as a copolymer
of styrene and acrylic acid or an epoxy resin has been
used. This binder is neutral in view of the electrical
charging and it is easy to produce. Those 
toners using the resins as the binder and capable of
satisfying all of important properties for the toners,
that is, anti-offset property, blocking resistance, low
temperature fixing property, anti-vinyl chloride migration,
etc. have not yet been obtained in view of the natures of
the resins employed.That is, in the case of the vinyl polymer represented
by the styrene-acryl copolymer, if it is intended to improve
the anti-offset property, the softening point and the
crosslinking density of the resin have to
