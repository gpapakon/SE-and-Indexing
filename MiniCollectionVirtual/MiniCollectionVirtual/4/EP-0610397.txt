<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
disc brake, and in particular to a disc brake with a 
variable width caliper. Many types of disc brakes have been proposed 
over the years. A disc brake with a variable width type 
of caliper has been proposed previously in French Patent 
No. 1,531,556 published July 5, 1968. However, current 
production brake calipers typically utilize a rigid 
caliper structure which spans the rotor disc in order to 
carry inner and outer brake pads and react the clamping 
loads. The majority of service brake calipers contain 
one or more pistons which can be displaced, hydraulically, 
to apply the clamping forces to the shoes. As the friction 
pads wear, the pistons must extend from their cylinder 
bores and the hydraulic system must have a sufficient 
capacity to make up the changes in required fluid volume. 
It is highly desirable to provide a disc brake which can 
provide the service braking function by mechanical actuation 
and thus not require any hydraulic fluid for actuation. 
It is desirable that such a disc brake contain as 
few parts as possible, be highly reliable, and effect 
large clamping loads for braking. It is also advantageous 
if such a disc brake could contain hydraulically actuated 
pistons for service braking, while retaining the mechanical 
actuation function for parking brake applications 
and also provide automatic wear adjustment so that changes 
in fluid volume requirements are minimal. It is highly 
advantageous if such a disc brake comprises easily assembled 
members having high stiffness and low weight, resulting 
in the service pistons needing to travel only a distance 
sufficient to take up the running clearance of the 
brake and pad deflections. If the brake contains high 
stiffness and low weight components, the inherently stiff 
caliper assembly reduces the hydraulic fluid requirement 
of the brake system and also reduces the size and power 
requirements of a brake booster utilized for service 
braking.  
 The above problems are solved by the present 
invention which comprises a disc brake with a variable 
width caliper, comprising a pair of spaced apart movable 
members extending across a rotor of a vehicle, each movable 
member connected with a first bridge member and a 
second bridge member, each of the bridge members including 
friction lining means, each movable member having at one 
end thereof thread means receiving threadedly thereon nut 
means, one axial end of each nut means including teeth 
means, an actuator sleeve about each

<CLAIMS>
A disc brake with a variable width caliper, 
comprising a pair of spaced apart movable members (20, 30) 

extending across a rotor (51) of a vehicle, each movable 
member (20, 30) connected with a first bridge member (14) 

and a second bridge member (15), each of the bridge members 
(14, 15) including friction lining means (16, 17), each 

movable member (20, 30) having at one end thereof thread 
means (26, 36) receiving threadedly thereon nut means (28, 

29), each nut means (28, 29) including teeth means (38, 
39), an actuator sleeve (10, 11) about each movable member 

(20, 30) and having teeth means (10A, 11A) which engage the 
teeth means (12, 13) of a respective nut means (28, 29), 

and the second bridge member (15) received slidably on the 
movable members (20, 30), so that rotation of the actuator 

sleeves (10, 11) causes said nut means (28, 29) to rotate 
and effect translational movement of the movable members 

(20, 30) whereby the bridge members (14, 15) bring the 
respective friction lining means (16, 17) into engagement 

with said rotor (51). 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein each nut means (28, 29) includes therein opening 

means (28B, 29B) such that an associated axial portion of 
the nut means (28, 29) may be altered and threads (38, 39) 

of the nut means (28, 29) engage the thread means (26, 36) 
of the respective movable member with a predetermined 

frictional engagement which resists rotation of the 
respective nut means (28, 29). 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein each actuator sleeve (10, 11) engages thrust 

bearing means (44, 45) disposed between the actuator sleeve 
(10, 11) and the second bridge member (15). 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein the second bridge member (15) includes a pair of 

spaced-apart openings (41, 42) through which extend the  
 

movable members (20, 30), and bushing means (35) disposed 
in each spaced-apart opening (41, 42) and about the 

respective movable member (20, 30). 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein the first bridge member (14) includes a pair of 

spaced apart openings receiving therein the movable 
members (20, 30), each movable member (20, 30) having an 

enlarged diameter head (18, 19) which engages the first 
bridge member (14) adjacent the respective opening. 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein each of the actuator sleeves (10, 11) includes a 

lever member (10C, 11C) extending therefrom and connected 
to means for actuation. 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein one bridge member (15) includes at least one bore 

(50) with a piston (52) disposed therein, the bore (50) 
containing hydraulic fluid which, when pressurized, 

causes said piston (52) to move into engagement with the 
respective friction lining means (16). 
The disc brake in accordance with Claim 7, 
wherein the bore (50) includes an abutment (33) which 

limits outward movement of said piston (52). 
A vehicle parking system which includes the 
disc brake in accordance with Claim 1, the system 

including a spring actuator (70) wherein release of a 
spring (72) of the actuator (70) to effect a parking 

brake application causes displacement of a cable (22) 
and, by reaction, displacement of a movable conduit (23), 

the cable (22) and conduit (23) connected to respective 
actuator sleeves (10,11). 
The system and disc brake in accordance with 
Claim 9, further comprising motor means (75) for 

returning said spring actuator (70) to an inactivated 
mode, and solenoid means (77) for retaining said spring 

(72) in a retracted position in the inactivated mode.
