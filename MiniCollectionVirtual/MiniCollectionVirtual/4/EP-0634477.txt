<ABSTRACT>
A method for stabilizing an agent for contact lenses 
containing a proteolytic enzyme by adding a surfactant to a 

solution containing an effective amount of a proteolytic enzyme, 
the production of a lyophilized agent for contact lenses 

containing a proteolytic enzyme, which comprises subjecting an 
aqueous composition containing a proteolytic enzyme to a 

lyophilizing treatment in the presence of a surfactant, and a 
lyophilized agent for contact lenses which contains a 

proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant. The method of the present 
invention enables stable preservation of a proteolytic enzyme in 

a liquid form. In addition, cleaning, sterilization and 
preservation can be simultaneously performed with a single 

solution, wherein an efficient removal of soil is achieved by 
only immersing contact lenses in the agent in a solution state. 

Accordingly, the agent of the present invention is 
advantageously used with ease by simple handling. The method 

for producing the lyophilized agent of the present invention 
enables stabilization of a proteolytic enzyme during preparation 

into a lyophilized formulation. Furthermore, the lyophilized 
agent of the present invention permits the proteolytic enzyme 

to remain stable and is extremely superior in solubility. When 
preserved as an aqueous solution, the stability of the enzyme 

can be maintained over a long period of time due to the action 
of a surfactant contained therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for stabilizing 
an agent for contact lenses containing a proteolytic enzyme, 
which comprises adding a surfactant to the agent. The present 
invention also relates to a method for producing a lyophilized 
agent for contact lenses containing a proteolytic enzyme. 
Further, the present invention relates to a lyophilized agent 
for contact lenses containing a proteolytic enzyme. Contact lenses are classified into hard contact lenses and 
soft contact lenses. While hard contact lenses were non-hydrophilic 
and less oxygen-permeable, those having improved 
oxygen permeability have been developed in recent years. These 
lenses are susceptible to soil by protein etc. and need to be 
cleaned, sterilized and preserved daily as with soft contact 
lenses for an additional effect of maintaining oxygen 
permeability. A protein soil attached to the surface of contact lenses 
can be decomposed and removed by the action of a proteolytic 
enzyme and various cleaning agents have been proposed and 
actually used. The proteolytic enzyme is, however, unstable in 
water and various measures have been employed to overcome this 
defect. For example, an agent in the form of a solid containing 
a proteolytic enzyme as a main component, such as tablet,  
 
granule, powder or the like is provided and an end-user 
dissolves same in purified water etc. every time before actual 
use. This method of dissolving a solid cleaning agent every 
time of use causes high prices, as well as forces users to 
undergo troublesome procedure. In addition, said preparation in 
a solid state tends to suffer from poor solubility. Meanwhile, 
there have been proposed several methods for stabilizing a 
proteolytic enzyme in a solution state to provide a treating 
solution for contact lenses. For example, Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication No. 167726/1989 discloses a preserving 
solution containing a water soluble polymer having quaternary 
ammonium group and hydroxyl group, and an enzyme. This 
preserving solution shows poor cleaning effect and is 
insufficient as a cleaning solution. Also, Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication Nos. 159822/1988 and 180515/1989 propose 
a method for stabilizing a proteolytic enzyme by adding the 
enzyme to a solution containing a water miscible organic liquid. 
However, the enzyme activity of this solution is extremely low 
such that its cleaning effect is unpractical. Some of the 
conventional enzyme-stabilized solutions for contact lenses 
require diluting for use so as
