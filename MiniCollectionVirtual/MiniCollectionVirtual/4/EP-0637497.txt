<ABSTRACT>
A welder for thermoplastic materials has at least one feed channel and a feeding device assigned to the latter for a polymer strand, the feed channel or the feed channels opening out via a respective opening into a pelletising device, which has a knife element which can rotate about a knife axis of rotation and has at least one knife with a cutting edge, and there following a pelletising device for a transporting device and a plasticating device for plasticating and for the discharge of the polymer material. According to the invention, the surface of revolution generated by the cutting edge(s) (33, 42) during the rotation of the knife element (26, 36) intersects the knife axis of rotation with its continuation directed towards the said knife axis of rotation, and at least a part of the surface of revolution lying in the region of the opening of the feed channel (9, 39) or the parts of the surface of revolution lying in the region of the feed channel is or are designed as a counter-knife.

<CLAIMS>
Plastics welding appliance (1) having at least one feed
channel (9, 39) and associated with it a feed device (11, 38)

for a plastics strand, the feed channel (9, 39) or the feed
channels emerging by way of a respective opening into a

comminuting device which has a cutter element (26, 36)
rotatable about a cutter rotation axis and with at least one

cutter (32, 41) having a cutting edge (42), and a conveying and
plastifying device (20, 21, 22), for plastifying and extruding

the plastics material, adjoining the comminuting device,
characterised in that the rotation surface generated by the

cutting edge(s) (33, 42) upon rotation of the cutter
element (26, 36), when projected towards the cutter rotation

axis, intersects the cutter rotation axis, and in that at least
a part located in the rotation surface in the region of the

opening of the feed channel (9, 39) or parts located in the
rotation surface in the region of the feed channels is or are

formed as counter cutters.
Plastics welding appliance according to claim (1),
characterised in that the rotation surface is a plane

perpendicular to the cutter rotation axis.
Plastics welding appliance according to claim (1) or (2),
characterised in that the cutter element (26, 36) is equipped

with a plurality of cutters (32, 41).
Plastics welding appliance according to one of claims (1)
to (3), characterised in that the feed device has a feed

roller (11, 38) rotatable about a roller rotation axis, and the
feed channel (9, 39) or feed channels respectively extends or

extend in the region of the feed roller (11, 38) at least along
part of it parallel to the roller rotation axis and is or are

open towards the feed roller (11, 38), and that the feed
roller (11, 38) bears profiling (12) which reaches into the

feed channel (9, 39) or feed channels and which effects feeding
displacement of the plastics strand. 
Plastics welding appliance according to claim (4),
characterised in that the profiling is formed as at least one

helical feeding fin (12).
Plastics welding appliance according to claim (5),
characterised in that the profiling is constructed with feeding

fins extending in multiple start formation.
Plastics welding appliance according to claim (6),
characterised in that t
he feed channel (9) or the feed
channels, adjoining the respective opening, has or have a part

section of closed construction.
Plastics welding appliance according to one of claims (4)
to (7), characterised in that the cutting edges (42) are so

oriented that they produce outwardly directed cutting pressure
inclined to the radial.
Plastics welding appliance according to one of claims (4)
to (8), characterised in that the cutter element (26, 36) is

secured at the outlet end of the feed roller (11, 38).
Plastics welding appliance according to one of claims (1)
to (9), characterised in that the conveying device has a

conveying screw (21) rotatable about the screw rotation axis
and that the cutter element (26, 36) is fitted co-axially on

the conveying screw (21) at its inlet end.
Plastics welding appliance according to one of claims (4)
to (9) and claim (10), characterised in that the feed

roller (11, 38) and the conveying screw (21) are arranged
co-axially and connected rotationally fast to each other, the

cutter element (26) being arranged between the two of them.
Plastics welding appliance according to claim (11),
characterised in that the cutter element (26, 36) is clamped

between the conveying screw (21) and the feed roller (11, 38).
