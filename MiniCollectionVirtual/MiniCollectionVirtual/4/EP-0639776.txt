<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining 
characteristics of the flow of a medium in a channel by 

measuring the transit time of sound waves which are 
transmitted between one or more transducers, and determining 

the characteristics from the measured transit times. 
In one embodiment of the method according to the 
invention, at least two sound waves whose transit time 

depends on swirl are transmitted along acoustic paths with 
a different sensitivity to swirl, and a measure of the 

swirl is determined from the measured transit times. 
In another embodiment, at least two sound waves 
whose transit time depends on the symmetry of the flow 

profile are transmitted along acoustic paths with a 
different sensitivity to symmetry, and a measure of the 

symmetry is determined from the measured transit times. 
These embodiments are preferably combined. 
If weighting factors are allocated to the values 
obtained, the individual velocities of the sound waves can 

be used to calculate the average flow velocity and/or the 
throughput of the medium. Since allowance is made for 

possible disturbances of the velocity profile, the accuracy 
of the calculated variables is good. 
The invention also provides for a device, by means 
of which the method according to the invention can be 

carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally the present invention relates to a method for determining swirl and symmetry of the flow of a medium
in a channel by transmitting and receiving sound waves along two or more acoustic paths having different degrees of
sensitivity to swirl and to symmetry using one or more acoustic transducers, each of which can act individually as a
transmitter and/or receiver, and by measuring the transit times of the transmitted sound waves, and determining a
value of swirl and symmetry from the measured transit times. Furthermore the invention relates to a device for carrying
out this method.Acoustic flow measurements are already known. It involves determining the average flow velocity and/or the
throughput of the medium from the difference in transit time of sound waves which are transmitted in the downstream
direction and upstream direction respectively between acoustic transducers set up at a distance from each other. The
medium can be a gas or liquid.The transit times of the sound waves not only depend on the flow velocity of the medium, but are also influenced
by the flow profile of the medium. In a flowing medium, apart from the longitudinal movement, a swirl can occur. Other
possible disturbances of the ideal flow profile are a flow velocity fluctuating in time and a flow profile which is asymmetrical
relative to the longitudinal axis. Such disturbances occur in particular in pipe systems which have a complex
structure.The ultimate reliability of the calculated flow velocity of the medium depends on the distance covered, the acoustic
path, on the transmitted sound wave, and on the calculation method used. Many configurations are known for the
acoustic path.In the case of the conventional methods which are used in commercially available measuring instruments, several
acoustic paths are used, running parallel to each other. The known numerical Gaussian square method is used for
positioning of the paths and the various weighting factors which are allocated to the measured velocities.The advantages of this method are clear. No additional information on the flow profile is required for calculating
the velocity. The weighting factors are fixed in advance, so that the microprocessor which is used for calculation of the
characteristics need only carry out a limited number of calculations.Although this means that measurement of the flow velocity is simple to carry out and excellent results can be
obtained in ideal flow conditions, the method has a number of clear disadvantages, due to the underlying
