<ABSTRACT>
An improved radio frequency antenna may be manufactured and assembled in 
a cost-effective manner using a pair of conductive sections. A first conductive 

section has alternating trough and narrow portions, and an opposing second 
conductive section has alternating trough and narrow portions which are arranged 

opposite the narrow and trough portions, respectively, of the first conductive section. 
Each trough portion partially surrounds its opposing narrow portion. The first and 

second conductive sections are secured together with a gap formed therebetween such 
that the first and second conductive sections form an elongated unit having a first end 

and a second end. Each end of the unit may be terminated with a short, an open or a 
load between the first and second conductive sections, and a coaxial cable may be 

electrically coupled to the first and second conductive sections at a selected point 
along the length of the unit for coupling a radio frequency signal to the antenna. 

Alternatively, the unit may be terminated at only one end, and the other end of the 
unit may be used for interfacing to the coaxial cable. Further, a smaller diameter 

radome may be used to enclose the unit because of the compactness of the improved 
trough line antenna structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to antennas for radio frequency
communication and, more particularly, to polarized antennas for radio communication
in frequency ranges above about 100 MHz.Accurate and cost-effective radio signal transmission is becoming increasingly
important in many applications. For example, widespread use of cellular radio
communication has significantly raised the stakes in terms of service and sales.
Proper antenna design can provide tangible benefits with respect to communication
performance and equipment maintenance. These benefits include savings in terms of
maintenance costs, equipment utilization, and increased system reliability. Moreover,
cost-effective antenna designs provide reduced manufacturing costs and increased
sales and profits.While numerous antenna structures have been designed with the above
objectives in mind, each has compromised cost and/or performance. One of the most
popular structures, for example, is a sleeved-dipole assembly, which includes a
collinear array of dipoles secured to and surrounding a coaxial cable. The dipoles
are used to convert the coaxial cable into a radiating transmission line, or antenna.
Unfortunately, this type of antenna system is costly to manufacture and maintain due
to the number of dipoles and related mounting components.A radio frequency antenna having the features of the preamble of
claim 1 is known from EP-A-0487053. US-A-3031668 describes an
antenna formed by coaxial line segments which are connected in a
collinear array while alternating inner and outer connections.
The coaxial cable section completely enclose the conducting
wires.Accordingly, there is need for an antenna structure which overcomes these
deficiencies.A general object of the present invention is to provide an improved antenna
structure that is reliable, accurate and cost-effective to manufacture and sell.Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved antenna
structure that produces a more omnidirectional azimuth pattern.A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved antenna  
structure with an improved array pattern.Still another object of the present invention is to provide a more compact
antenna structure capable of fitting into a smaller diameter radome.A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved
antenna structure such that the impedance of the radiating elements is easily
controlled.A more specific object of the present invention is to provide an improved
antenna structure that
