<ABSTRACT>
A pool sweep (1) having a continuously-cycling, flow-interrupting valve (8) at the upstream entrance to an inertial flow chamber (7). The valve (8) has an entrance mouth with one or more closure lips (17) pivoting between open and closed positions to open and close the mouth. The lips (17) are biased towards the opened position with low creep biasing means, as by materials having a strain at their elastic limit of below 0.5 such as one or more metal springs (37) urging the lip toward closure. Desirably, the opening bias is substantially less than the closing force on the lips (17) created by the water flow under steady flow conditions as well as over an opening-initiating region towards the open position beginning from the full closure and in the region intermediate these two end regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to swimming pool cleaning devices that
operate automatically to move over the surface to be cleaned when
water is induced to flow through the device by the suction created by
conventional swimming pool filtration equipment. In these devices
water flow in a flow passage through the device is intermittently
interrupted by a valve mechanism in the passage with the result that
the device moves step-wise in random fashion over the pool surfaces.
This allows the surfaces to be cleaned by water flowing over such
surfaces into and through the device to the filter unit.Among the various valving arrangements that have been
proposed for such cleaning devices U.S. Patent No. 4,769,867 describes a
valve in the form of a pair of "jaw-like" members biased to an open
position by the inherent elasticity of the plastic material forming a
portion or all of the valve. The mode of operation is as follows. When
suction is applied to the flow passage water flows through the passage
and this reduces the pressure at the internal surfaces of the valve.
When the flow velocity reaches a critical value, the valve doses due to
the differentially higher pressure on the external surfaces of the valve
which overcomes the biasing force maintaining the "jaws" at the open
position.While the described valve could have potential advantages of
simplicity, relatively compact size and reduced susceptibility to plugging
by debris, it has inherent limitations which render it unsatisfactory as it
is incapable of achieving the sustained operation required for typical
applications in which the cleaner is operated on a daily cycle, usually for
daily periods of up to 18 hours or higher. Over a period of a year of such
sustained operation may require up to fifty million or more beats or
cycles of the valve.Specifically, it has been found that in operation over time
elastomeric material employed to bias the valve to the open position is 
inherently subject to creep and gradually looses its "memory" such that
the "jaws" do not return completely to the open position. As this
memory loss or creep progresses the valve begins to cycle more rapidly,
with consequent undesirable loss of flow rate, and finally the valve
ceases to function entirely.The memory loss defect has been partially overcome by
application of an auxiliary, low creep biasing means to maintain the
valve open during periods of non-use, thus permitting at least partial
restoration of the memory of the elastomeric material. Nevertheless,
over time, permanent deformation
