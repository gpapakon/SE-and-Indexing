<ABSTRACT>
A high performance, low complexity, concatenated code is disclosed. The 
concatenated code uses a multidimensional trellis coded modulation as the inner code and a 

low redundancy Reed-Solomon code as the outer code. The concatenated code, in addition 
to being highly bandwidth efficient, is effective in handling both Gaussian and impulse noise. 

The concatenated code has the further advantage of using a small constellation for a given 
bandwidth efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to concatenated Reed-Solomon code and multidimensional trellis-coded 
modulation useful, for example, in cable and over-the-air transmission of compressed 
digital television signals. Cable and over-the-air transmission of compressed digital television signals is 
susceptible to both Gaussian and impulse noise. As a result, schemes for increasing the 
bandwidth efficiency of this transmission must provide immunity to both Gaussian and 
impulse noise. Prior art systems which provide such noise immunity are complex and thus 
expensive, particularly where the data rate across a channel is high. However, consumer 
products, such as cable television reception equipment, must be reasonably priced if those 
products are to be widely successful in the marketplace. A concatenated code which uses a multidimensional trellis code as the inner code and 
a low redundancy Reed-Solomon code as the outer code is provided. The concatenated code 
is not only bandwidth efficient but also provides immunity to Gaussian and impulse noise. 
Using an inner, multidimensional trellis-coded modulation, in accordance with the invention, 
has the advantages of lower complexity, higher performance, and a smaller constellation for  
 
a given bandwidth efficiency. Using a low redundancy Reed-Solomon code advantageously 
provides better performance than can be obtained using a more complex, higher redundancy 
Reed-Solomon code because the low redundancy Reed-Solomon code permits the use of a 
smaller constellation for a given bandwidth efficiency. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the trellis code selects symbols from 
a QAM constellation and the Reed-Solomon code generates on average no more than 0.375 
redundant bits per symbol of the constellation. In an other embodiment of the invention, the 
Reed-Solomon code generates on average no more redundant bits than are generated by the 
multidimensional trellis code, and preferably corrects no more than three Reed-Solomon 
symbol errors per Reed-Solomon codeword. In the drawings:
