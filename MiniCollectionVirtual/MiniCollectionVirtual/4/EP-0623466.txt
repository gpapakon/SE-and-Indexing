<CLAIMS>
A printing roller, comprising a core cylinder and a
sleeve of plastic, wherein the sleeve comprises a

tubular base body of a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic
material and wherein the base body is

directly coated on its outer surface with a layer of
copper or a copper alloy produced by plasma-spraying

or high-speed flame-spraying of powder having a
particle diameter D
50
 of ≤ 20 µm.
The printing roller as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the core cylinder is formed as a hollow body of

metal or of thermoplastic or thermosetting fiber
composites.
The printing roller as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the core cylinder is tapered on at least one end

face and has radial bores along its longitudinal
axis.
The printing roller as claimed in any of claims 1 to
3, wherein the fiber-reinforced thermoplastic

material contains carbon fibers, glass fibers,
aramid fibers, metal fibers, ceramic fibers, boron

fibers or else other fibers as endless fibers or
long fibers in the form of impregnated strips or

fabrics, the fiber content being 30 to 80 % by
weight, preferably 50 to 75 % by weight.
The printing roller as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the thermoplastic comprises polypropylene

(PP), polyamides (PA) such as polyhexamethylene-adipamide
or poly-ε-caprolactam, high-pressure or

low-pressure polyethylene (PE), poly(phenylene
sulfide) (PPS), polycarbonate (PC), polyoxymethylene

(POM), polyether-ether-ketones or thermoplastic
polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) or

poly(butylene terephthalate), or mixtures thereof.
The printing roller as claimed in any of claims 1 to
5, wherein the plasma-sprayed layer of copper or

copper alloy on the matrix-rich outer surface of the
base body of the sleeve has a layer thickness in the

range from 50 to 500 µm, preferably from 100 to
300 µm.
The printing roller as claimed in any of claims 1 to
6, wherein the layer of copper or copper alloy has

a homogeneous structure without oxide interlayers,
a pore-free surface and a surface roughness in the

range of R
a
 ≤ 0.1 µm.
The printing roller as claimed in any of claims 1 to
7, wherein the copper alloy additionally contains

the metals zinc, tin, iron, nickel, manganese,
silicon, aluminum, lead or mixtures thereof.
The printing roller as claimed in any of claims 1 to
8, which shows a positional deviation in the range

from 0.02 to 0.04 mm and a dimensional deviation in
the range from 0.01 to 0.03 mm.
