<ABSTRACT>
Procedure for moving the main girder (3) and trolley (2) of a crane comprising a gantry part (6) with its bracing structures and a traversing machinery with traversing ropes (4), the traversing machinery being mounted in conjunction with the gantry part. According to the procedure, the trolley is moved by the same traversing machinery as the main girder. When the main girder (3) is to be moved, the trolley (2) is interlocked so that it remains immovable with respect to the gantry (6) and the traversing movement is performed by winding one of the traversing ropes (4a or 4b) onto the winding drum (1) of the traversing machinery and at the same time unwinding the traversing rope (4b or 4a) on the opposite side from the winding drum (1). When the trolley (2) is to be moved, the trolley interlock is released and the traversing movement is performed in the manner described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure as defined in
the preamble of claim 1 for moving the main girder and trolley
of a crane and to an apparatus according to the preamble
of claim 6.In previously known technology, low-profile container
cranes, especially those used in harbours, have a gantry
part which can be moved longitudinally on the quay along
rails provided for the crane. Mounted on the gantry part is
a horizontal main girder which, when in the working position,
extends over the ship at the quay. At the end of the
working period, the main girder is moved away from its position
over the ship to a rest position or to a new working
position on the opposite side. In these low-profile cranes,
this movement generally takes place in the horizontal direction.
The main girder is provided with horizontal rails carrying
a movable trolley which transfers the containers from
the ship to the quay and vice versa. For moving the trolley,
the machine room of the crane is provided with a traversing
machinery comprising a traversing motor and a gear system, a
winding drum and traversing ropes between the winding drum
and the trolley. Moreover, the machine room contains a traversing
machinery for moving the main girder which generally
comprises the same kind of equipment as the traversing machinery
moving the trolley. In addition to the two traversing
machineries, the machine room contains a hoisting machinery
comprising substantially the same kind of equipment
as the traversing machineries. There are also solutions with
two machine rooms, enabling one of the traversing machineries
or the hoisting machinery to be placed in a separate
machine room.An obvious drawback with the previously known technology
described above is that the machine room is crowded because
it contains three different machineries. Further drawbacks 
are the difficulty of accommodating three different sets of
ropes and the diverting pulleys needed for them, and the
structural complexity and high cost resulting from the large
number of parts. In this type of previously known solutions,
the trolley generally moves along when the main girder is
moved, involving the disadvantage of a complicated control
arrangement. Another drawback involved is that the crane
operator has to drive the trolley separately to a parking
position or to walk along the main girder from the operator's
cabin to a ladder or elevator on the gantry.From DE-C-393 731 a procedure for moving the main girder and

Procedure for moving the main girder (3) and trolley (2) of
a crane comprising a gantry part (6) with its bracing structures

and a traversing machinery with traversing ropes (4) for
moving the main girder (3), the traversing machinery being

mounted in conjunction with the gantry part, whereby the trolley
(2) is moved by means of the same traversing machinery as

the main girder (3), characterized in that for moving the main
girder (3) bearings (5) located on the gantry part (6) of the

crane are lifted by means of lifting devices (9) to a high position
so as to movably support the main girder (3),

and for moving the trolley (2) said bearings (5) are lowered by
means of said lifting devices (9) to a low position so that the

main girder (3) rests on the support blocks (13) fixed to the
gantry part (6) of the crane. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that,
when the main girder (3) is to be moved, the trolley (2) is

interlocked so that it remains immovable with respect to the
gantry (6) and the traversing movement is performed by winding

one of the traversing ropes (4a or 4b) onto the winding
drum (1) of the traversing machinery and at the same time

unwinding the traversing rope (4b or 4a) on the opposite
side from the winding drum (1).
Procedure according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in
that when the trolley (2) is to be moved, the trolley is

released from its interlock with respect to the gantry (6)
and the traversing movement is performed by winding one of

the traversing ropes (4a or 4b) onto the winding drum (1) of
the traversing machinery and at the same time unwinding the

traversing rope (4b or 4a) on the opposite side from the
winding drum (1).
Procedure according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in
that, when the trolley (2) is to be moved, the main girder

(3) is interlocked so that it remains immovable with respect
to the gantry (6) and the traversing movement is performed

by winding one of the traversing ropes (4a or 4b) onto the
winding drum (1) of the traversing machinery and at the same

time unwinding the traversing rope (4b or 4a) on the opposite
side from the winding drum (1). 
Procedure according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized
 in that the trolley (2) is interlocked so that
it remains immovable with respect to the gantry (6) preferably

in a location from where the crane operator has an easy
access to a stairway 
leading down or to an elevator.

machinery, whereas when the trolley interlock is released,

the trolley is moved by the same traversing machinery.
