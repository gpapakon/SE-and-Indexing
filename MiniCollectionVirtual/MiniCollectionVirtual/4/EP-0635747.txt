<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the alignment film
for liquid crystals usable for planar display panels
which display television picture images and computer
picture images and method for production thereof.Liquid crystal display units such as color
liquid crystal display panels have conventionally been
produced by sealing liquid crystal between two
substrates formed of a matrix of counter electrodes
through an alignment film for liquid crystal formed by
coating polyvinyl alcohol or polyimide using a spinner.These units, as shown in Figure 2, are
produced by precoating poly(vinyl alcohol) or polyimide
using a spinner in an insulating manner onto the
respective electrodes of the first glass substrate (31)
with a thin-film transistor (hereinafter abbreviated as 
TFT) array (33) with a picture element electrode (32),
and the second glass substrate (34) formed of multiple
red, blue, and green color filters (35) and a common
transparent electrode (36) on top of the aforementioned
color filters, forming an alignment film for liquid
crystal (37) by rubbing, then assembling them facing
each other by electrode side on either side of the
spacer (38) using the adhesive (39); the twist nematic
(hereinafter abbreviated as TN) liquid crystal (40),
etc., is then inserted, forming a panel structure;
polarizing plates (41, 42) are then installed on the
front and back sides of the panel, and the TFT is
operated while irradiating with the back light (43) so
that the color picture image is displayed in the arrow
direction A.However, the conventional production of an
alignment film for liquid crystal involves dissolving
polyvinyl alcohol or polyimide in an organic solvent,
then forming a film using rotating coating methods, then
finally rubbing it with a felt cloth; therefore, it was
difficult to achieve uniform coating of the alignment
film for liquid crystal panels with large surface areas,
e.g., 14-inch display; further, rotating coating methods
resulted in films up to several 5 Âµm thick, causing a
large defect in performance of display panels such as
ferroelectric liquid crystal requiring alignment films
for liquid crystal with a thickness of approximately
1,000 Angstroms. EP-A-0 286 539 discloses the use of organosilane-type
compounds for forming an alignment film for liquid crystals.
According to said document octadecyl-trietoxysilane, dimethyl-octadecyl-aminopropyl-silane
and mixtures obtained by mixing
one of the above compounds with N-methyl-aminotrimethoxysilane
or dimetoxy-methyl-chlorosilane are particularly
preferred
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A substrate with an alignment film (17) for a liquid crystal material
(20) consisting of a monomolecular film of chlorosilane-type

surfactants bonded with liquid crystal molecules of the type
of the molecules of the liquid crystal (20) to be aligned,

said monomolecular film being formed on said substrate (16) by
chemisorption.
A method for the production of an alignment film for
liquid

crystal material which comprises forming a single layer of a
monomolecular film formed through chemisorption of a

chlorosilane-type surfactant bonded with a liquid crystal
molecule of the type of the molecules of the liquid crystal to

be aligned on a surface of a specified substrate on which
electrodes are formed by causing the chemical bonding between

the silicon in said surf actant and the surface of same
substrate directly on the surface of said substrate.
