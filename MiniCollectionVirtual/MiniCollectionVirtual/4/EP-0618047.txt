<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended to ease the fitting and removal of pins which provide the connection of framework (structural) elements, particularly metal ones. This device comprises a three-part thrust cylinder body (6,7,8) designed to bear via its open front end on one framework element. The thrust cylinder body contains a chuck (36), which can move axially, with jaws (38) for gripping one end of a connection pin to be fitted or removed, and means for controlling the closing/opening of the chuck (36) as well as for pulling and axially moving this chuck in one direction or the other, it being possible for these means to be produced in the form of a set of three pistons (21,25,32) delimiting four chambers (46,47,49,50), means (4) being provided for supplying energy. Application to the assembly of the tower elements of a slewing tower crane.

Device for fixing and removing connecting pins (54) for 
frame elements (68, 69), notably for metal frames, comprising a 

actuator body (6, 7, 8) suitable for bearing at its open front 
end on a frame element (68, 69), a set of pistons (21, 25, 32) 

mounted so as to slide in an axial direction inside the actuator 
body (6, 7, 8), which delimit several chambers (46, 47, 49, 50) 

receiving a hydraulic or pneumatic fluid, a chuck (36) with 
jaws (38), able to move axially, for clamping one end (61, 65) 

of a connecting pin (54) to be fixed or removed, control means 
(21 to 35) for clamping/unclamping the chuck (36) and for the 

traction and axial movement of this chuck (36) in one 
direction or the other, and energy supply and control means (2 

to 5), 
characterised in that
 the actuator body (6, 7, 8) is 
produced in three parts: a front actuator body part (6), tubular 

in shape and receiving a front piston (21) comprising a head 
(22) receiving the chuck (36) at its periphery and mounted so as 

to slide inside the said part (6), and a hollow rod (23) 
oriented towards the rear, a rear actuator body part (7), also 

tubular in shape, receiving a rear piston (25) fixedly connected 
to the hollow rod (23) of the front piston (21), comprising a 

head (26) mounted so as to slide inside the said part (7), and a 
hollow rod (27) oriented towards the rear whose internal cross 

section forms a bore (28) closed off at the rear by a plug (29), 
and a fluidtight separating partition (8) between the front part 

(6) and rear part (7) of the actuator body having at its centre 
a bore (24) through which there is slidably mounted the hollow 

rod (23) connecting the rear piston (25) to the front piston 
(21) whose internal part encloses a central piston (32) 

comprising a head (33) mounted so as to slide inside the bore 
(28) in the hollow rod (27) of the rear piston (25) and a rod 

(34) oriented towards the front and mounted so as to slide 
through a bore (35) formed in the centre of the head (22) of the 

front piston (21), the rod (34) acting on the jaws (38) of the  
 

chuck (36). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
chuck (36) comprises a socket (37) screwed onto the head (22) 

of the front piston (21), tilting jaws (38) disposed inside the 
socket (37) and a tapered seat (39) screwed onto the front end 

of the rod (34) of the central piston (32) and bearing on a 
projecting part (40) of the inside of the jaws (38). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
front actuator body (6) delimits, with the front piston (21) and 

the partition (8), a first chamber (46) with an annular cross 
section, whilst the inside of the hollow rod (23) of the said 

front piston (21) forms, with the central piston (32) and a part 
of the bore (28) of the hollow rod (27) of the rear piston (25), 

a second chamber (47) with an annular cross section, which 
communicates with the first chamb
er (46) through orifices (48) 
formed through the wall of the hollow rod (23). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the rear 
actuator body (7) delimits, with the head (26) of the rear 

piston (25), the hollow rod (23) of the front piston (21) and 
the partition (8), a third chamber (49) with an annular cross 

section, whilst the bore (28) of the hollow rod (27) of the rear 
piston (25) forms, with the head (33) of the central piston (32) 

and the plug (29), a fourth chamber (50) with a circular cross 
section. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that a connecting sheath (4) containing hydraulic or pneumatic 

hoses and an electrical supply cable terminates at the rear of 
the actuator body (6, 7, 8), a bellows (9) preferably being 

mounted at the rear of the actuator body (6, 7, 8) and allowing 
the connecting sheath (4) to pass, and this actuator body (6, 7, 

8) having on the outside at least one control handle (10).  
 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that it is applied to the fixing and removal of connecting 

pins (54) for assembling mast elements (68, 69) forming the 
raisable vertical tower of a tower crane. 
Use of a connecting pin (54) with the fixing device according 
to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the pin (54) 

comprises a body (55) in two coaxial cylindrical parts (56, 57), 
with distinct but not very different diameters, connected through 

an intermediate area (58) with a progressive diameter, the end 
situated on the same side as the part with the larger diameter 

(56) having a head (59) formed by a footing (60) extended by a 
short projecting stud (61), while the other end (62) is formed 

by a tapered part (63) extended by a long stud (65). 
Use of a connecting pin according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the studs (61, 65) are fixed, for example by screwing, to 

the two ends of the pin (54), the fixing device (1) preferably 
being adapted for the screwing/unscrewing of the said studs (61, 

65).
