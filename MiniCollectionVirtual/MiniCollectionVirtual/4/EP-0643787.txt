<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for transporting and using a drilling apparatus (10) or a construction crane apparatus (308) from a single movable vessel is provided. Either a drilling apparatus or a construction crane apparatus is skidded onto the deck of a jack-up rig (12) which is then floated to a remote location for use of the apparatus. The skidding of the construction crane apparatus is facilitated by a new and unique pony structure (304) to raise the base of the construction crane apparatus above a skid on the jack-up rig (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and
apparatus for transporting and/or using a drilling
apparatus or a crane apparatus from a single movable
vessel, and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus
for utilizing a conventional jack-up rig as both a
transportation barge and work platform for drilling
operations or high capacity crane operations.There are two main activities that are performed in
a remote, sub-sea oil field. The first of these
activities is construction and demolition of fixed
platforms. The second of these activities is the
drilling or work-over of oil wells. The construction and
demolition of platforms is a labour intensive activity and
requires specially designed, high capacity construction
cranes to lift the building materials necessary for fixed
platforms. The specially designed, high capacity cranes
are often required to lift loads between 450 and 1,000
tons (4.57 to 10.16 x 105kg).It is presently common for cranes of this capacity,
hereafter referred to as "construction cranes", to be
mounted upon sea-going barges. Individual barges are
therefore dedicated as construction barges. However, 
those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a
barge-mounted crane will roll, pitch, and yaw with the
sea surface. This movement adversely affects the ability
of a construction crane to safely and accurately lift
large loads. This problem is compounded when the load to
be lifted is also affected by the motion of the water,
e.g., when the load is on a different barge. Indeed, it
is not uncommon for a construction crane barge to wait
for 30 days or more in a remote field location before the
seas are calm enough to utilize the crane. Moreover,
even land-based construction cranes are sensitive to even
slight deflections in their support structures. Thus, it
has long been desired to eliminate these problems
associated with construction cranes.In addition to using construction crane barges to
build or demolish fixed platforms, construction crane
barges are also utilized to lift onto the platform the
pieces of a drilling package comprising the drilling
derrick and other related drilling apparatus to drill or
work-over an oil well. However, because of the heavy
loads associated with this drilling package, construction
crane barges are not ideally suited to this task.Moreover, the prior art practice of using dedicated
construction crane barges requires that a multiplicity of
barges be available for a given remote field location to
accomplish the tasks of construction and

characterised in
 comprising:

a pony (304) comprising a plurality of beams (305) to support the
construction crane (300), the beams (305) being substantially parallel to each

other and spaced apart by a width less than the skid rail width to facilitate
introducing the pony (304) into the skid fairway on the jack-up rig (12);
a plurality of support structures (316-331) within the pony (304) that

above the skid fairway, the elevated zone having a width at least as great as
the width of the base (302) of the construction crane (300), the elevated zone

facilitating skidding the construction crane (300) on and off the jack-up rig (12)
and over obstacles outside the skid fairway, the support structures (316-331)

supporting an overhang of the construction crane base (302) caused by the
construction crane base (302) being wider than the width of the skid fairway,

the support structures (316-331) facilitating operation of the construction
crane (300) from the elevated zone when the jack-up rig (12) is jacked-up, the

plurality of support structures (316-331) being movable during the raising and
lowering of the jack-up rig (12).
A construction crane package (308) according to Claim 1, in which the
pony (304) has a bottom surface and a top surface (303) interconnected by

support structures (316-331) such that the top surface (303) is wider than the
bottom surface. 
A construction crane package (308) according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in
which some of the support structures (320-323, 328-331) are oriented at an

angle from a vertical axis.
A construction crane package (308) according to any one of the
preceding claims, further comprising a plurality of support plates for raising

the base (302) of the construction crane (300).

some of the support structures (316-331) are joined to some of the support

plates at unequal angles, preferably at least half of the support plates being
