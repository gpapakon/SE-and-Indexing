<ABSTRACT>
The invention is an animal chew which contains one or more enzymes and substrates for the purpose of generating antimicrobial compounds upon contact with an animal's saliva. The animal chew, made of rawhide, biscuit or dried animal food is provided with an oxidoreductase enzyme and substrate, such as, for example, glucose oxidase and glucose, which produces hydrogen peroxide upon being chewed. A catalase may be provided to stabilize the system and prevent premature activation of the enzyme/substrate system. A peroxidase and halide or pseudohalide ion combination may be provided to enhance the antimicrobial effect of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chewable object for animals
which contains one or more enzymes and substrates for the purpose
of generating antimicrobial compounds upon contact with an
animal's saliva, in addition to containing catalase or other hydrogen
peroxide- degrading enzymes in specified amounts to stabilize the
activity of said chewable object during manufacture and storage.
More specifically, chewable and consumable compositions are herein
described which, upon being chewed, produce hydrogen peroxide or
other antimicrobial agents.A number of naturally occurring antimicrobial systems
rely upon the ability of certain oxidizing agents to disrupt metabolic
processes of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Compounds such as
hypothiocyanite (OSCN-/HOSCN), hypochlorite (OCl-, HOCl), and
hypoiodite (OI-, HOI) are known to inhibit glycolysis, penetrate
prokaryotic cell walls, and generally disrupt a wide variety of
processes crucial to the survival of lower organisms. These oxidizing 
agents are the result of the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide by
mammalian peroxidase systems, such as those found in saliva,
cervical fluid, lacrimal fluid, and leukocytes.The antimicrobial effectiveness of the aforementioned
oxidizing agents is well established in the literature and is known to
begin to occur at concentrations of about 10 - 100 micromoles per
liter. Hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-/HOSCN) achieves antimicrobial
effectiveness at around 100 micromoles per liter, while hypoiodite
and hypochlorite ions (OI-/HOI and OCl-/HOCl, respectively) are
effective inhibitors of microorganisms at concentrations as low as 10
to 50 micromoles per liter. The limiting factor in all of the
mammalian antimicrobial peroxidase systems is usually the
availability of hydrogen peroxide.The numerous prior art attempts to activate or
supplement natural antimicrobial peroxidase systems are generally
limited to the oral care field. US 4,150,113 and US 4,178,362
(Hoogendorn, et al) describe dentifrices containing glucose oxidase
in order to react with plaque and salivary glucose to produce low
levels of hydrogen peroxide.US 4,269,822, US 4,564,519 and US 4,578,265 (Pellico, et
al.) further describe dentifrice compositions containing an
oxidoreductase enzyme, together with its specific substrate, for the
purpose of producing hydrogen peroxide or other antimicrobial
oxidizing compounds, such as hypothiocyanite ion. In each of these
prior art formulations, the oxidoreductase enzymes and substrates
are in aqueous solution and homogeneously distributed
