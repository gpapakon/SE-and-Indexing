<ABSTRACT>
In a supply device (1) for a plurality of weft threads (2, 3, 4), in each case with specific supply means (5, 6, 7) for the weft threads and with means (14) for selecting the weft thread to be inserted, there is provision for monitoring quality defects of the weft threads, whereby, when a quality defect of a weft thread is detected, this weft thread is not selected for insertion into the fabric until the quality defect has been transported away into a region from which it can no longer be woven into the fabric.

Process for the feeding of weft threads (2, 3, 4) and for 
weaving them into a fabric (34) on a loom, with feeder apparatus 

(1) for the feeding of at least two weft threads in alternation, 
each such thread being fed by a feeder mechanism (5, 6, 7) of its 

own which in each case comprises a thread storage unit (17A, 17B, 
18A, 18B, 19A, 19B) and a mechanism (14) for the selection of a 

weft thread to be woven into the fabric that can be activated by 
a control unit (37),
characterized in that
 
the weft threads (2, 3, 4) are checked for quality defects in the 

area between the thread storage unit and the fabric, and quality 
defect detection signals are transmitted to the control unit 

(37), which evaluates these signals and causes the selection 
mechanism (14) to select for weft insertions only the weft thread 

or threads that are free from quality defects, until the part of 
the weft thread comprising the quality defect, which is moved 

away from the area of the selection mechanism (14), has reached 
a predetermined area. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the weft 
thread (2, 3, 4) comprising a quality defect remains connected 

to the fabric (34) and is carried away from its feeder mechanism 
(5, 6, 7) by the fabric, until the part of the weft thread 

comprising the quality defect has moved beyond the area of a weft 
cutter (10). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the weft 
thread (2, 3, 4) comprising the quality defect is captured by an 

accessory device (54) and moved away.  
 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the feeder mechanisms (5, 6, 7) each comprise an unwinding 
device (20, 21, 22), the weft threads (2, 3, 4) are checked for 

quality defects before the unwinding device, and the length or 
quantity of weft thread on the unwinding device is detected and 

evaluated by the control unit (37). 
Feeder apparatus (1) for a loom, for the feeding of at least 
two weft threads (2, 3, 4) in alternation to be woven into a 

fabric (34), each such thread having a feeder mechanism (5, 6, 
7) of its own which in each case comprises a thread storage unit 

(17A, 17B, 18A, 18B, 19A, 19B) and a mechanism (14) for the 
selection of a weft thread to be woven into the fabric (34) that 

can be activated by a control unit (37),
characterized in that
 
in the area of each feeder mechanism (5, 6, 7) between the thread 

storage unit and the fabric there is at least one detector (23, 
24, 25, 26, 27, 28) to check the weft thread for quality defects, 

which is connected to the control unit (37), the said control 
unit comprising evaluation controls which, when a signal 

indicating a quality defect in a weft thread is received, block 
the activation of the selection mechanism (14) for that weft 

thread until the part of the weft thread comprising the quality 
defect has been moved away to a predetermined area. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 in the 
area of the thread storage unit of each feeder mechanism (5, 6, 

7) a detector (23, 24, 25) is positioned between two storage 
bobbins (17A, 17B, 18A, 18B, 19A, 19B), which emits a signal 

indicating the change-over from one storage bobbin to the other. 
Apparatus according to Claims 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 
the feeder mechanisms (5, 6, 7) each comprise an unwinding device 

(20, 21, 22) and in each case a detector (26, 27, 28) to check 
the weft thread (2, 3, 4) for quality defects is positioned 

between the thread storage unit (17A, 17B, 18A, 18B, 19A, 19B) 
and the unwinding device.  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 
associated with each unwinding device (20, 21, 22) there is a 

winding turns detector (45, 46, 47) to detect the number of 
winding turns present on the unwinding device. 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized 
in that
 the control unit (37) comprises a control mechanism (42) 
to reactivate the selection of a weft thread (2, 3, 4) in which 

a quality defect was detected, such that the said control 
mechanism takes account of the time interval after reception of 

a quality defect indication signal and/or the number of weft 
threads woven into the fabric after the said signal. 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized 
in that
 a detector (53) to detect quality defects in the weft 
thread is connected to the control unit (37), the said detector 

being positioned somewhere in the path along which the weft 
thread is moved away. 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 5 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 to carry away a weft thread (2, 3, 4) comprising a 
quality defect, a suction device (54) is provided which is 

positioned after the selection mechanism (14) and the weft thread 
insertion mechanism.
