<ABSTRACT>
A thermal printer has a printhead (30) with 
a plurality of resistive heating elements selectively 

energized and de-energized to generate printed images 
on sheet material (S). In order to improve the 

quality of the printed image, capacitive means (76) 
are provided to eliminate surges in the power 

supplied to the printhead (30). The capacitive means 
(76) is mounted in close proximity to the printhead 

(30) to minimize inductive impedance in the power 
supply system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal printing
apparatus which generates printed images in a variety
of patterns on sheet material. More particularly, the
apparatus has a thermal printhead with a plurality of
heating elements energized by a stabilized source of
power.Printing apparatuses utilizing thermal printheads
are well known, and because of their flexibility they are
often utilized in printers which produce a wide variety of
printed images, particularly images that are defined in
stored or transmitted digital data programs. Such printing
apparatus that are utilized for generating signs, designs,
characters and numerous other graphic images on a
strip of sheet material are disclosed in US-A-4 543 587
and in DE-A-3 613 946.In order to provide clear images with high resolution,
the printheads are constructed with densely packed
heating elements arranged in a linear array for selective
energization and generation of printed images in small
pixels. One such printing head has a linear array of heating
elements approximately 30,5 cm (12 inches) long
with elements arranged at a density of 118 per cm (300
per inch).With a printhead having a large number of heating
elements, a regulated power supply is needed and the
power supply must have the capacity to energize all of
the heating elements simultaneously or substantially
simultaneously. Such energization can, however, cause
significant load demands and if the image being printed
has intermittent printing, that is a sequence of alternate
inked and non-inked spots in the direction of printing, the
regulating circuits of the power supply may not be able
to respond to the load cycling between peak power and
zero or low power demands of the printhead. As a consequence
of load cycling and inductive impedance in the
circuitry between the power supply and the printhead,
the printed image may fade and intensify due to current
surges that arise as transients in the circuits supplying
power to the head. Such transients distort the printed
image and cause it to depart from the digital data in the
program that defines the image.A number of known solutions for improving the
response of the printhead include increasing the capacity
of the power supply. Naturally, however, practical considerations
limit the effectiveness of such a solution since
the power supply is typically operating at less than 50%
capacity.Another solution which is incorporated in existing
drivers for printheads is phased energization of the heating
elements in the head.
For example, a printhead
