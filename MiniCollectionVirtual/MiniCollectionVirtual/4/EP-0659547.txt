<ABSTRACT>
A breakthrough buffer for presses, for reducing noise or vibration occuring during blanking using a mechanical press, and 

a control method therefor. The apparatus is provided with a buffer body (20) disposed below the punch (3) of a press (1) and 
cushioning the punch during the breakthrough of the press, a timing regulator (40) connected to the buffer body and regulating 

the timing of the same during the breakthrough of the press, and a controller (60) adapted to send out a command for a regulating 
position to this regulator. The noise or vibration occuring during the breakthrough of the press is detected, and a command signal 

is sent out from the controller (60) to the timing regulator (40) to regulate the timing of the buffer body (20), whereby noise or vibration 
occuring during the breakthrough of the press is minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a breakthrough
buffer for presses and a control method therefor,
for reducing noise occurring during
blanking, as known from DE-C-3 734 701.Buffers according to the prior art are
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 60-21832 and Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 52-19376. These buffers have
a rod, a piston, a cylinder, a throttle valve and the
like, and utilizes as a buffering force a flowing
resistance which occurs when oil flowing out from a
cylinder chamber passes through the throttle valve,
thereby reducing the breakthrough of a press.However, in order to effectively reduce noise
by buffering the breakthrough of the press, it is
necessary to finely regulate the timing of buffering
against the timing of blanking. A spacer is attached
to the rod or the like for this regulation. Since an
optimum timing varies depending on blanking conditions 
such as a plate thickness, shape and size of a punch,
material of a plate, temperature and the like, this
method requires a worker to find out an optimum timing
by trial and error each time blanking conditions
change, and to set the timing accordingly. Even when
the optimum timing is set, a change of conditions
(temperature, etc.) during blanking will cause the
timing to deviate, with a resultant occurrence of a
problem in actual use. Another problem is that
utilizing a flowing resistance induced by throttling
requires a slide to lower against the flowing
resistance after the breakthrough of the press, thus
causing the press to do excess work.Fig. 15A shows the load of a press in a
conventional blanking state, i.e. a load exerted on the
press at blanking. Fig. 15B shows an oil pressure in a
buffer cylinder in the conventional blanking state,
indicating that the pressure remains unchanged. Fig.
15C shows the displacement of a slide in the
conventional blanking state. Fig. 15D shows the sound
pressure of noise in the conventional blanking state,
indicating that a noise level is higher. Fig. 16A
shows the load of a press when buffering is performed
using conventional throttling, indicating that the
press does an excess work represented with W after the
breakthrough of the press. Fig. 16B shows an oil
pressure occurring in the buffer cylinder when 
buffering is performed using conventional throttling.From DE-C-3 734 701 (closest prior art) a control method is known for a breakthrough buffer for presses for
buffering the breakthrough of a press ram occurring during blanking in a mechanical press in
which
