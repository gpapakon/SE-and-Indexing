<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a deposit lock for transport trolleys, in each case the coupling member of one trolley being lockable in the deposit lock of the next trolley and the deposit lock containing a lock mechanism which releases the trolley against the insertion of a deposit token, with the inserted deposit token being locked at the same time, and which releases the deposit token when the trolley is coupled again. To prevent misuse, the deposit token has an additional actuator which makes the operative connection between it and the lock mechanism and which is necessary for the lock function.

<CLAIMS>
Token-return lock for a conveying trolley which can be 
pushed into a trolley of the same type, each trolley being 

provided with a token-return lock (1) and a coupling member 
(2) such that the coupling member of one trolley can be 

locked in the token-return lock of the next trolley to 
couple together trolleys standing in a row or to release the 

trolley which is preferably standing at the end of the row 
by inserting a returnable token (3, 13, 23), and the token-return 

lock containing a lock mechanism (5, 15) which locks 
the inserted returnable token when the trolley is released 

and releases it when the trolley is re-coupled, 
characterised in that the returnable token (3, 13, 23) 

comprises an additional actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) 
which effects the operative connection between the 

returnable token (3, 13, 23) and/or its actuating member 
(3a, 13a, 23a) on one hand and the lock mechanism (5, 15) on 

the other. 
Token-return lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a, 13a) co-operates with 

guideways (4a, 14a) in the token-return lock. 
Token-return lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a) itself forms an operative 

connection with the lock mechanism (5). 
Token-return lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the actuating member (23a) is moved or held by a magnet 

(25) in the token-return lock or that the actuating member 
itself is a magnet. 
Token-return lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) is a component 

which projects or springs back with respect to the contour 
of the returnable token (3, 13, 23) on one or both sides. 
Token-return lock according to claim 1, characterised in  
 

that the actuating member (3a; 23a) is held in a mobile 
manner in the returnable token (3, 23). 
Token-return lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) is a cylindrical 

pin, a ball or the like. 
Returnable token for a token-return lock, characterised 
in that the returnable token (3, 13, 23) comprises an 

additional actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) which effects the 
operative connection between the returnable token (3, 13, 

23) and/or its actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) on one hand 
and the lock mechanism (5, 15) on the other. 
Returnable token according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the actuating member (23a) is moved or held by a magnet 

(25) in the token-return lock or that the actuating member 
itself is a magnet. 
Returnable token according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) is a component 

which projects or springs back with respect to the contour 
of the returnable token (3, 13, 23) on one or both sides. 
Returnable token according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a, 23a) is held in a mobile 

manner in the returnable token (3, 23). 
Returnable token according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the actuating member (3a, 13a, 23a) is a cylindrical 

pin, a ball or the like.
