<ABSTRACT>
A tamper evident system for indicating when a closed enclosure 
(24) has been opened comprises a window (21) and a sensor (22) 

colour sensitive to presence of a gas. The sensor (22) is 
located in the enclosure (24) so as to be visible through the 

window (21). Any compositional change of gas in the enclosure 
(24) is signalled by a change of colour of the sensor (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tamper evident system and, more 
particularly, to a tamper evident system for indicating when a 
closed enclosure has been opened. The invention is characterised in that the enclosure is 
provided with a see-through membrane and indicating means 
colour sensitive to presence or absence of a gas, the 
indicating means being located adjacent the membrane so that 
opening of the enclosure causes compositional change of gas in 
the enclosure which is signalled by a change of colour of the 
indicating means visible through the membrane from outside of 
the enclosure. The gas composition within the enclosure is arranged to be 
different from air so that opening of the enclosure causes the 
gas composition within the enclosure to become similar to that 
of air which is signalled by change of colour of the 
indicating means. Following is a description, by way of example only and with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of 
carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings:- 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross section of an open flexible 
container including one embodiment of a tamper evident system  
 
in accordance with the present invention, Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 showing the container 
in a closed condition, Figure 3 is a view similar to Figures 1 and 2 in which a 
membrane of the container has been fractured, Figure 4 is a view similar to Figures 1 to 3 showing the 
container after having been opened from the closed condition 
shown in Figure 3, Figure 5 is a diagrammatic representation of a container and 
cooperating cap, the cap incorporating another embodiment of 
a tamper evident system in accordance with the present 
invention and shown separate from the container, Figure 6 is a view similar to Figure 5 showing the container 
and the cap being applied to the container to close the 
container, Figure 7 is a view similar to Figures 5 and 6 showing the 
container when closed by the cap, Figure 8 is a view similar to Figures 5 to 7 showing the 
container and the cap removed therefrom. Figure 9 is a diagrammatic representation of a container and 
cooperating cap, the cap incorporating a further embodiment of  
 
a tamper evident system in accordance with the present 
invention and shown separate from the container, Figure 10 is a view similar to Figure 9 showing the container 
and the cap being applied to the container to close the 
container, and Figure 11 is a view similar to Figures 9 and 10 showing the 
container and the cap removed

<CLAIMS>
A tamper evident system for indicating when a closed 
enclosure (17,24,30) has been opened characterised in 

that the enclosure (17,24,30) is provided with a see-through 
membrane (13,21,28) and indicating means 

(14,22,29) colour sensitive to presence or absence of a 
gas, the indicating means (14,22,29) being located 

adjacent the membrane (13,21,28) so that opening of the 
enclosure causes compositional change of gas in the 

enclosure which is signalled by a change of colour of the 
indicating means (14,22,29) visible through the membrane 

(13,21,28) from outside of the enclosure. 
A system as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the 
composition of the gas in the enclosure (17,24,30) is 

different from that of air. 
A system as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that the 
composition of the gas in the enclosure (17,24,30) is 

provided by exposure to a material (14,22,29) which 
scavenges one or more gases in the enclosure (17,24,30) . 
A system as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that 
composition of the gas in the enclosure (17,24,30) is 

provided by reacting reactive components one with 
another. 
A system as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that 
composition of the gas in the enclosure (17,24,30) is 

provided by addition of a gas before the enclosure 
(17,24,30) is closed. 
A system as claimed in Claim 5 characterised in that the 
gas which is added is carbon dioxide. 
A system as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that 
oxygen is a scavenged gas. 
A system as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that compositional change of gas is 

effected by rupturing a wall (15) of a reservoir (12) 
containing a gas after the enclosure (17) has been 

closed. 
A system as claimed in claim 9 characterised in that the 
reservoir (12) is integral with the enclosure (17) and 

separable therefrom by a fracturable membrane (15). 
A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that the enclosure (24,30) is formed in 

a container (18,25) having a removable cap (20,27). 
A system as claimed in Claim 10 characterised in that the 
cap (20) includes an additional membrane (23) which is 

fractured as the cap (20) closes the container (18). 
A system as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that the indicating means is sensitive 

to carbon dioxide. 
A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 or 8 to 
11 characterised in that the indicating means is selected 

to indicate when the proportion of oxygen in the 
enclosure is less than that of air. 
A system as claimed in Claim 13 characterised in that 
the indicating means is sensitive to oxygen.
