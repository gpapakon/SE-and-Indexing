<ABSTRACT>
A resilient mechanism for converting the rotary movement of a geared motor (6) output shaft into linear movement, in particular for moving retractable bollards (1) consists of two helical members (A) and (B) rotating together and offset by a half pitch, said members being enclosed in a movable housing (2) and forming a travelling path for two runners (G1) and (G2) on the ends of a shaft (4) rotated by a drive shaft (5). Rotation of the shaft (4) moves members (A) and (B) and their housing (2) in a linear direction. When they reach their limit of travel, (A) and (B) are slightly compressed and thus form a resilient connection between the extended housing (2) and the driving assembly.
