<ABSTRACT>
There is described an ejection container having a generally 
elongated prismatic shape with a discharge opening at one end and an 

ejector blade (1) movable between a retracted position remote from 
the discharge door and an extended position adjacent the discharge 

door, wherein the ejector blade has an entry opening (2) which is 
selectively closeable by an entry door means (3, 4, 23, 24), the 

entry door means (3, 4, 23, 24) being moved from its open to its 
closed position by means of one or more actuators (5, 6, 22). In the 

preferred embodiment,the actuators (5, 6, 22) do not move with the 
ejector blade (1), the actuators (5, 6, 22) and the entry door means 

(3, 4, 23, 24) having engageable cooperating formations to transmit 
actuating force from the actuators to the entry door means when the 

ejector blade (1) is in its position remote from the container's 
discharge door.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to refuse handling systems, and is 
particularly concerned with a system wherein refuse is compacted into a 
container which can be mounted to a vehicle for transportation, the 
container having an ejector blade movable longitudinally within the 
container to eject rubbish contained therein, as defined in the preamble of claim 1. In conventional containers of this type, the container is of a 
prismatic shape having a discharge door at one end. An ejector blade 
whose outline conforms to the internal shape of the container is mounted 
for longitudinal movement towards and away from the discharge door. The 
ejector blade is normally positioned at the end of the container remote 
from the discharge door, to form an end wall of the container. In WO-A-91/00231 there is described a container having an ejector 
blade which has an upper and a lower half, the upper half being slidably 
mounted on the lower half so as to be vertically retractable. In the 
retracted position, refuse is charged into the container via an opening at 
the upper part of the container front wall. When such containers are operated, rubbish is conventionally 
delivered into the container and passed over the ejector blade, to fall 
into the container between the blade and the discharge door. When the 
container is full, and the rubbish is to be discharged therefrom, the 
discharge door is opened, and the ejector blade is moved longitudinally of 
the container to expel the compacted rubbish through the discharge door. A disadvantage of this type of equipment is that substantial and 
massive movement of the various parts of the vehicle can cause 
instability. Likewise, the actuators for movable compaction apparatus 
have also to be supplied with power, and due to the long travel of the 
compaction apparatus, supplying these actuators with power either by 
hydraulic or electrical means is complicated in that the power supply 
cables or ducting must of necessity follow the motion. This leads to 
expensive and complicated power transmission arrangements.  
 According to the present invention, there is 
provided an ejection container having a generally elongated prismatic 
shape with a discharge opening at one end closeable by a discharge door, 
and an ejector blade movable between a retracted position remote from the 
discharge door and an extended position adjacent the discharge door and 
having a compaction face facing toward the discharge door and a rear face 
directed away from the discharge door, and wherein

An ejection container having a generally elongated prismatic 
shape with a discharge opening at one end closeable by a discharge door, 

and an ejector blade movable between a retracted position remote from the 
discharge door and an extended position adjacent the discharge door and 

having a compaction face facing toward the discharge door and a rear face 
directed away from the discharge door, and wherein the ejector blade (1) 

has an entry opening (2) which is selectively closeable by an entry door 
means (3, 4, 24, 25), the entry door means (3, 4, 24, 25) having an open position in which 

the entry opening (2) is unobstructed, and a closed position wherein the 
entry opening (2) is closed, the entry door means (3, 4, 24, 25) being moved from 

its open to its closed position by means of one or more actuators (5, 6, 26) 
characterised in that the entry door means (3, 4, 24, 25) comprises a pivoting 

entry door (24), mounted to pivot about an axis extending generally along 
one side of the entry opening (2) from a closed position wherein the 

pivoting entry door (24) is substantially in the plane of the ejector 
blade (1) to an open position wherein the pivoting entry door (24) extends 

away from the ejector blade (1) from the rear face thereof, and a sliding 
entry door (25) mounted for sliding movement in the plane of the ejector 

blade, and in that the pivoting entry door (24) is retained in its closed 
position by engagement with the sliding entry door (25). 
An ejection container according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the actuators (5, 6, 26) for the entry door means do (3, 4, 24, 25) do not move with the
