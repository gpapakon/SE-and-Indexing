<ABSTRACT>
An improved device for controlling the rate at 
which gas is exhausted from an air bag cushion (12) which 

is used in passenger vehicles. A novel gas vent is 
incorporated into the material from which the air bag is 

made. The vent comprises a dynamic vent (28) that is 
impermeable to gas below a critical temperature and is 

permeable to gas above a critical temperature. The dynamic 
vent provides additional venting of gas during a high 

impact collision or when a larger than average occupant 
impacts onto the air bag cushion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable-type modular 
occupant restraint systems for passenger vehicles or, as they are 
more commonly known, air bag restraint systems. Such a system may 
be installed in an automobile or other vehicle, at least in part on 
the steering wheel or adjacent to the driver for the protection of 
the driver and also in the dashboard or adjacent to an occupant for 
passenger protection in the event of a collision. More 
particularly, this invention relates to an improved means for 
controlling the discharge rate of gas from an air bag cushion and 
for preventing the over-pressurization of the air bag cushion. Air bag restraint systems for restraining the movement of 
occupants of a motor vehicle during a collision have long been 
known. The air bag restraint system is located in close proximity 
to the occupants and normally is in an uninflated condition. In 
the event of a crash, however, the air bag is inflated in 
approximately 20 to 40 milliseconds by a gas produced by the 
burning of a gas generant material in a gas generator or, as it is 
more commonly known, an inflator. The gas generant is ignited by 
an initiator. The pressure of combustion gases resulting from the 
rapid burning of the gas generant material causes gas to rush into 
the bag to effect a rapid rate of inflation thereof. The gas 
generated by the inflator is filtered by a filter unit internal to  
 
the inflator. An air bag cushion, which is normally made from a material 
that may be substantially impermeable to the flow of gas, typically 
is provided in part thereof with at least one vent port which 
serves as an outlet for gas contained within the air bag cushion. 
Alternatively, the air bag cushion may be provided in part thereof 
with a permeable fabric which functions as an outlet for gas 
contained within the cushion. The vent port or permeable fabric 
for typical operating conditions relieves excess pressure from 
within the air bag cushion to prevent the cushion from bursting and 
to prevent recoil of an occupant who impacts onto an 
overpressurized air bag cushion. When the gas generating material 
is more reactive due to storage at a high temperature; i.e., 
storage in a vehicle on a bright sunlit day, when the vehicle is 
involved in a high-energy collision, or when an extremely large 
occupant is present the vent means may not afford adequate pressure 
relief for the air bag cushion. It is preferable to provide a 
secondary pressure relief route to accommodate the release of 
increased

<CLAIMS>
A safety air bag cushion assembly for use in 
passenger vehicles, of the type in which an air bag is 

inflated by the flow of a hot gas under pressure provided 
from an inflator, said air bag cushion comprising: 

   a foldable body of said air bag cushion (12) having 
a first portion (14), which is disposed opposite an 

occupant of the vehicle when said air bag cushion is 
inflated, said first portion being made of a cloth 

substantially impermeable to gas, a second portion (16) 
attached to said first portion, said second portion 

terminating in a third portion (18) defining a gas inlet 
opening (20) for said air bag cushion, wherein said first, 

second and third portions are made of fabric; 
   at least one vent (26) formed into said second 

portion of said air bag cushion; 
   at least a dynamic vent (28) in covering relation 

to said vent of second portion, wherein said dynamic vent 
is made of a fabric which is slightly permeable to the 

generated gas at a pressure below a critical pressure and 
wherein said dynamic vent is opened by the flow of hot gas 

through said dynamic vent causing the fabric of the dynamic 
vent to melt; and 

   a vehicle air bag cushion canister having an inside 
and an outside including a wall defining a cavity for an 

inflator (22) and at least part of a folded inflatable 
occupant restraint cushion, said wall further defining an 

opening to said cavity in said container, said inflator 
being actuable to generate a gas under a pressure in said 

cavity, wherein said air bag cushion is inflated by said 
generated gas. 
A safety air bag cushion assembly for use in 
passenger vehicles, of the type in which an air bag is 

inflated by the flow of a hot gas under pressure provided

   a foldable body of said air bag cushion (12) having 
a first portion (14) which is disposed opposite an 

occupant of the vehicle when said air bag cushion is 
inflated, said first portion being made of a cloth 

substantially impermeable to gas, and a second portion (16) 
attached to said first portion, said second portion 

terminating in a third portion (18) defining a gas inlet 
opening (20) for said air bag cushion; 

   at least a dynamic vent (28) formed in said 
material of second portion, said dynamic vent being 

continuous to and formed from the same piece of material as 
said air bag cushion second portion; 

   a vehicle air bag cushion canister having an inside 
and an outside including a wall defining a cavity for an 

inflator (22) and at least part of a folded inflatable 
occupant restraint cushion, said wall further defining an 

opening to said cavity in said canister, said inflator 
being actuable to generate a gas under a pressure in said 

cavity, wherein said air bag cushion is inflated by said 
gas of varying temperature; and 

   wherein said dynamic vent is slightly permeable to 
the generated gas at a pressure below a critical pressure 

and wherein said dynamic vent is opened by the flow of hot 
gas through said dynamic vent causing the fabric of said 

dynamic vent to melt.

claim 2 wherein the fabric from which the air bag cushion 
(12) is formed is made from glass, fiberglass, nylon 66, 

nylon 6, vinyl coated fiberglass, or polyester. 
A safety air bag cushion according to any preceding 
claim wherein the fabric from which said dynamic vent is 

made is formed by a one-over-three weave (36, 38).

micropores (34) into the fabric from which the safety air 
bag cushion is made by the use of a laser.
