<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the fluorescent whitening of paper surfaces
using a specific bis-stilbene whitening agent.The stilbene class of stilbene fluorescent whitening agents is widely used in the paper
industry but frequently suffers from inadequate bleed fastness to water when used in
coating compositions.In GB-A-1 247 934, there is described a wide range of bis-stilbene compounds, including
the compounds of formula (1), as defined herein. This reference also describes the use the
said compounds for the fluorescent whitening of paper, but only in the mass or in the size
press, without the use of auxiliaries, and not for the surface coating of paper using a
pigmented coating composition. Moreover, in GB-A-2 026 566 and GB-A-2 026 054,
there is described the use of a wide range of stilbene fluorescent whitening agents
containing a sulfo group, including the compounds of formula (1), in pigmented surface
coatings for the surface coating of paper. However, it is an essential feature of these
disclosed processes, that a solution of the said compounds, in specific solvents, namely
oxyalkylated fatty amines (GB-A-2 026 566) or lactams (GB-A-2 026 054), must be used
to prepare the respective fluorescent formulations employed in the production of the paper
coating compositions.Surprisingly, it has now been found that one specific bis-stilbene fluorescent whitening
agent, when used in paper coatings, or in the size press with specific auxiliaries, provides
a high fluorescent whitening effect at very low use levels, combined with a whole range of
other properties which are desired for paper coating applications, such as improved bleed
fastness to water. No special solvents are necessary for the formulation of the fluorescent
whitening agent.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the fluorescent whitening of
paper comprising contacting the paper surface with a coating composition comprising a
white pigment; a binder dispersion; optionally a water-soluble co-binder; and 0.01 to 2 % 
by weight, based on the weight of the pigment, of a fluorescent whitening agent having the
formula:

wherein M is hydrogen, an alkali metal, ammonium or magnesium, in the absence of a
lactam having the formula:

in which m is 0 or an integer between 1 and 9; or comprising contacting the paper in the
size press with a combination of the compound of formula (1) and an auxiliary selected
from a sequestering agent and a dispersing agent and/or an emulsifier, in the absence of a
lactam having the
