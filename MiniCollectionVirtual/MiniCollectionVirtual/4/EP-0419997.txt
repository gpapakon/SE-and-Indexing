<ABSTRACT>
A cloned DNA fragment of 
Bordetella pertussis
 including 
the gene which codes for the pilinic subunit fim3, 

vectors which contain it and microorganisms transformed 
by the vectors. 
The protein and peptides corresponding to at least 
one epitope of the gene which codes for the pilinic 

subunit fim3 are particularly useful for the development 
of acellular anti-pertussis vaccines. 
In addition, a strain of Bordetella modified by 
a recombinant replication or genome-integration vector 

containing the cloned DNA fragment or the gene or a 
fraction thereof is particularly suitable for the 

development of a cellular anti-pertussis vaccine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the cloned and 
sequenced gene which codes for the pilinic subunit fim3 
of Bordetella pertussis or a peptide corresponding to 
at least one epitope thereof, the cloned DNA fragment 
of Bordetella pertussis including the gene, vectors 
containing it, microorganisms transformed by the 
vectors and their use for the development of a vaccine 
effective against pertussis. Pertussis is a disease of the respiratory tract caused 
by Bordetella pertussis (B.pertussis), a microorganism 
which is transmitted from a sick person to a 
susceptible healthy individual during the catarrhal and 
convulsive stage (the virulent stage or Stage I). Pertussis may cause convulsions, brain damage and 
sometimes death, particularly in infants and newborn 
babies without maternal anti-pertussis antibodies; an 
effective anti-pertussis vaccine is therefore 
particularly desirable. Cellular anti-pertussis vaccines are currently used and 
are constituted by virulent bacteria killed with 
merthiolate and treated at 56oC but, whilst they confer 
permanent protection, they may induce undesirable side 
effects. There is therefore a need to develop new anti-pertussis 
vaccines which do not have the aforesaid disadvantages. During stage I, B.pertussis produces some factors, 
known as virulence factors, which are necessary for 
infection to arise and persist.  The pili, for example, are factors involved in the 
specific adhesion of the bacteria to the cilia of the 
epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, which 
is an essential stage in the pathogenesis of pertussis 
since it enables the microorganism to elude the host's 
defensive system. The pili or fimbriae are extracellular proteins which 
are present on the surface of the bacterium and which 
are constituted by polymerised subunits whose molecular 
weights can vary from 21000 to 24000 Daltons. Within the cells, they are expressed as precursors of 
the protein and are thus constituted by a secretion 
signal sequence fused to the aminoacid sequence of the 
mature protein. The signal sequence is then removed by enzymatic 
digestion and the protein, suitably processed at the 
membrane level, is secreted in the mature form (that is 
without extraneous aminoacid sequences). Ashworth et al., (1982), (Infect. Immun., 37, 
1278-1281) first suggested that the fimbriae of 
B.pertussis were serotype-specific agglutinogens, that 
is, surface antigens which stimulate the production of 
antibodies which agglutinate the bacterial cells. Pilinic proteins of
