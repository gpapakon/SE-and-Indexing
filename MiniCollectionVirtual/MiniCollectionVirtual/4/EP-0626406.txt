<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic aromatic polyesters possessing high resistance to 
degradation in the molten state, are obtained by a two-stage 

polycondensation process comprising: 

a) reacting an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, or a derivative 
thereof esterified with a volatile alcohol, with an excess of a 

diol, until the dicarboxylic acid diglycolester or a mixture of 
oligomers thereof is formed; 
b) polycondensing the dicarboxylic acid diglycolester to obtain 
the thermoplastic aromatic polyester; 
 
wherein in stage b) or preferably in both stages a) and b) of the 

process a salt or a saline complex, soluble in the reacting 
mixture, of a metal chosen from the group comprising lanthanides 

(or rare earths) having an atomic number equal to or greater than 
62 is used as catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of thermoplastic polyesters possessing high
stability in the molten state.In particular, the invention relates to a process for the production of thermoplastic polyesters
containing essentially units derived from an aromatic dicarboxylic
acid alternating with units derived from a diol, said process
being based on the formation of ester groups by
condensation or transesterification.Thermoplastic aromatic polyesters, and in particular
polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) are widely used polymers, employed
generally for producing fibres, sheets, plates or formed articles
such as containers, components etc. possessing excellent
mechanical characteristics.These finished products are generally prepared by molten polyester
processing methods such as extrusion, moulding, blow-moulding,
thermoforming etc., all of which involve exposing the polymer to
high temperature, usually exceeding 200°C, for a period of at
least a few minutes but in certain cases more than 10-20 minutes.It is also frequently the case that a polyester needs to be 
processed several times under molten conditions to obtain the
finished product.Because of the high temperature, especially under conditions of
considerable mechanical stress as occurs during extrusion or
injection moulding, the polyester undergoes degradation leading to
lowering of the average molecular weight, an uncontrollable
linearity reduction, and decoloration and brittling of the polymer
after solidification.A second degradation occurs during the preparation of the
polyester, when it is maintained at a temperature exceeding 200°C
during bulk polymerization.To overcome the drawbacks due to thermal degradation of PET and
other thermoplastic polyesters numerous studies have been carried
out and various solutions have been proposed in the literature.In particular, the role of acid or basic impurities deriving from
the catalyst used for their preparation in favouring polyester
thermal degradation has been recognized.As is widely known and described for example in "Comprehensive
Polymer Science", Ed. G.C. Eastmond et al., Pergamon Press, Oxford
1989, vol. 5, pp. 275-315, thermoplastic polyesters can be
prepared in various ways, all comprising a condensation reaction
with the formation of ester groups. In particular, aromatic
polyesters are usually prepared by reacting a diol with an
aromatic dicarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof esterified with
a volatile alcohol such as methanol or ethanol.The preparation process is conducted
