<ABSTRACT>
A device for electrically connecting a coaxial cable to another electrical component comprises a sleeve for receiving an end of the coaxial cable, the sleeve having a pair of elongate conductive members that extend out of the sleeve from the interior thereof for forming a connection with the electrical component and two quantities of solder for connecting each conductive member to a conductor of the coaxial cable, wherein the sleeve is a unitary sleeve and the conductive members both extend out of the same end of the sleeve, at least one of the elongate conductive members being electrical insulated in order to prevent a short circuit between the conductive members. Also disclosed are a plurality of such devices located on a strip which joins at least one of the conductive members of each device, and a method of manufacturing the devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors, and in particular to 
connectors for forming electrical connections to coaxial cables. It is often necessary to form a connection between a coaxial cable 
and a printed circuit board (PCB) or other electrical component and a 
number of devices for forming such connections have been proposed, for 
example as described in US patent specifications US-A-3,743,748 and 
US-A-4,060,887. 
One such device which has been widely employed is that sold by 
Raychem Corporation under the registered trademark "PinPak". This 
device comprises a dimensionally heat-recoverable sleeve that is formed 
from a pair of component sleeves, each of which contains a quantity of 
solder. The sleeves are of different sizes and one end of the larger sleeve 
and a bond is formed between the sleeves by means of a ring of 
adhesive. A piece of wire is bent so that each end can be inserted into 
one of the sleeves (one end into the small sleeve and one end into the 
end of the larger sleeve that contains the smaller sleeve), and the 
sleeves are partially recovered to grip the wire. In order to terminate a 
coaxial cable the cable, after cutting back the jacket, outer conductor 
and dielectric by appropriate amounts, is inserted into the sleeve and 
the sleeve is heat recovered about the cable so that the conductors of the 
cable are each connected to one end of the wire by means of the solder. 
Afterwards the central portion of the wire can be removed by means of 
snips, so that the remaining parts of the wire act as pins for insertion 
into a PCB or other device. Such a connector with a sleeve having 
two coaxially partly overlapping parts is disclosed by EP-A-0 306 343.  
 Although this type of connector works well in practice it is 
relatively complex and requires a complex manufacturing process: The 
smaller of the two sleeves must be partially recovered about one end of 
the wire and a solder preform, the larger sleeve must be partially 
recovered about another solder preform and a ring of adhesive, and 
finally the larger sleeve must be accurately positioned over the end of 
the smaller sleeve and the free end of the wire and partially recovered 
thereon. This invention has, as its object, the provision of a similar coaxial 
cable connection device that can be produced by means of a less complex 
process. According to one aspect, the invention provides a device as defined in claim 1. 
By the expression 'unitary sleeve' is meant a sleeve having a 
single aperture out of which both
