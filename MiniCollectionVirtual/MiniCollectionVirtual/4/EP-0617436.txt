<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic resistor with a nonlinear voltage dependency comprising a ZnO-based sinter containing at least one rare earth 
element oxide, cobalt oxide, chromium oxide, at least one Group IIIb element oxide, at least one Group Ia element oxide, 0.01-2 

at.% (in terms of Ca) of calcium oxide and 0.001-0.5 at.% (in terms of Si) of silicon oxide and having the atomic ratio of calcium 
to silicon ranging from 0.2 to 20, preferably from 2 to 6. Since this element has the above-specified atomic ratio (Ca/Si), it has an 

extremely long service life even under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions. Further it is reduced in the deterioration 
of asymmetry of the current-voltage relationship due to a difference in the direction of applying a direct current. When 0.05-10 

at.% (in terms of Mg) of magnesium oxide is further added to the above composition, the above effects can be further enhanced 
and the grain growth is inhibited even when firing is conducted at a high temperature, with the result that the leakage current is 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to voltage-dependent nonlinear
resistors, such as it is, for instance known from DE-A-4 102 756.In accordance with the rapid advance of semiconductor
elements and semiconductor circuits such as thyristors,
transistors and integrated circuits and their applications, the
use of semiconductor elements and semiconductor circuits in
instrumentation, control and communication equipment and power
equipment is now widespread, and these equipment make rapid
progress toward miniaturization and higher performance. On the
other hand, despite such advances, these equipment and parts
used therein are not regarded satisfactory in withstand
voltage, surge rating and noise immunity. It is then a very
important task to protect such equipment and parts from
abnormal surge and noise or to establish a stable circuit
voltage. For solving these problems, there is a demand for the
development of a voltage-dependent nonlinear resistor material
which has substantial voltage-dependent nonlinearity, great
discharge withstand current rating, and improved life property
and is inexpensive. Used for such purposes are varistors containing silicon
carbide (SiC), selenium (Se), silicon (Si), ZnO or the like as
a major component. Among others, the varistors based on ZnO
are generally characterized by a low clamping voltage and a
great voltage-dependent nonlinearity index. These varistors
are then suitable for protection again overvoltage of equipment
composed of elements having a low overcurrent rating such as
semiconductor elements and have been widely utilized as a
substitute for SiC-based varistors.By the way, such ZnO-based voltage-dependent nonlinear
resistors are generally prepared, like voltage-dependent
nonlinear resistors based on other materials, by firing a
compact of a voltage-dependent nonlinear resistor-forming
source powder containing ZnO as a major component according to
a firing process including a heating step, a high temperature
holding step and a cooling step. In the prior art, the entire
firing process was carried out in an atmosphere having a
constant oxygen partial pressure (typically ambient air), but
no varistors thus obtained had a nonlinearity index α in excess
of 100, with α being normally about 50.JP-A 106102/1984 proposes a method for preparing a ZnO-based
varistor wherein the oxygen partial pressure of the
firing atmosphere used in the firing process is switched from
below to above 2x10-1 atm (air's oxygen partial pressure) in a
time region from a point in a later stage of the
