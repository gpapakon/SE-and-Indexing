A rotor blade made of fibre-reinforced synthetic resins for wind power 
plant, comprising 


a multi-part moulded core which has a central spar element (2) and a front 
and a rear profile element (4, 6) attached to the spar element, 
a unidirectional fibre layer (24) arranged at the top and underside in the 
direction of the longitudinal axis of the spar, wherein at least part of the 

unidirectional fibre layers extend over the whole length of the rotor blade, 
a metallic fastening member (10) for the rotor blade, which is arranged at 
the foot end of the blade and round which the unidirectional fibre wrapping is 

laid, in such a way that the spar element is joined rigidly to the fastening 
member by the unidirectional fibre wrapping, 
a cross-wrapping (26) lying on the unidirectional fibre layer (24), and 
a cross-wrapping (28) arranged over the whole moulded core with the spar 
element (2) and the front and rear profile elements (4, 6) attached to it, as the 

shell of the rotor blade. 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that a first layer (84) of 
unidirectional fibres extending over the whole length of the spar element and 

comprising only a few fibres is arranged on the spar element (2) of the 
moulded core, and that an internal cross-wrapping is arranged on this first 

layer, on which cross-wrapping the other fibres (24) of the unidirectional fibre 
layer lie. 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that a metallic insert element 
(10) is tied into the rotor blade at the tip of the blade, and that at least part of 

the unidirectional fibre wrapping (24) is wound over the fastening element (8) 
at the foot end of the rotor blade and over the insert element (10). 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that the spar element (2) is 
stepped longitudinally and formed with at least one transverse shoulder (3),  

 
and that part of the unidirectional fibre wrapping is wound over the fastening 

member (8) at the foot end of the rotor blade via said at least one transverse 
shoulder (3). 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that the fastening member (8) 
is provided with at least one hole (22) extending across the longitudinal axis 

of the spar, and a winding shoulder formed rotationally symmetrically with the 
axis of the hole. 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that a fastening flange (30) is 
arranged at the foot end of the rotor blade, with fastening pins (32) axially 

parallel with the axis of the spar, over which pins the unidirectional fibres are 
wrapped. 
The rotor blade of claim 5, characterised in that the fastening flange (30) 
is shaped with rounded shoulders (34), over which unidirectional fibres are 

wrapped, and that a covering flange (36) is provided for the wrapping layers 
(38) on the fastening flange (30). 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that the blade surface is 
covered with a thermoplastic film which is joined to the whole area by the 

synthetic resin. 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that the elements (2, 4, 6) of 
the moulded core are made of a pressure-resistant foam material. 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that the elements (2, 4, 6) of 
the moulded core are in the form of hollow bodies. 
The rotor blade of claim 1, characterised in that the hollow bodies are 
inflatable.  

 
A method of making the rotor blades of any of the preceding claims, 
comprising the use of a winding machine with 


two opposed, aligned gripping heads (60, 62) provided with a synchronous 
drive, 
a support (68) for non-rotatably holding the fastening member (8) in one of 
the gripping heads, 
means (10, 74) for reversal of the fibres, held non-rotatably in the opposing 
gripping head, 
means (66, 92) for producing a tensile force axially of the gripping heads, 
and further comprising the processing steps of 
making a support wrapping (80) comprising only a few unidirectional fibre 
runs (82, 84), between the fastening member and the opposing reversal 

means, 
inserting the spar element (2) between the runs (82, 84) of the support 
wrapping, 
applying a tensile stress to the fibres of the support wrapping, of a 
magnitude such that the spar element is held by the runs of the support 

wrapping without drooping. 
applying further wrapping runs to complete the unidirectional fibre wrapping 
(24), 
applying a cross-wrapping (26) to the unidirectional fibre wrapping (24) with 
rotation of the gripping heads, 
attaching the front and rear profile elements (4, 6), 
applying an external cross-wrapping (28) with rotation of the gripping heads, 
releasing the wrapped rotor blade and lowering it into a first rigid part (88) of 
a mould defining the profile of the finished blade, 
closing a mould with a second rigid part, 
pressing the rotor blade between the parts of the mould and 
curing the blade in the mould. 
The method of claim 12, characterised in that when the tensile stress has 
been applied to the support wrapping (80) of unidirectional fibres and the  

 
spar element (2) has been inserted between the runs (82, 84) of the support 

wrapping, a first internal cross-wrapping is applied to the support wrapping. 
The method of claim 12, characterised by the use of a wrapping shoulder 
(74) located across the axis of rotation (56, 58) as a reversal means. 
The method of claim 12, characterised by the use of a winding cap as a 
reversal means. 
The method of claim 12, characterised by the use of a metallic insert 
member (10) to be tied into the rotor blade at the tip of the blade, as a 

reversal means. 
The method of claim 12, characterised in that the distance between the 
fastening member (8) in one gripping head (60) and the reversal means in the 

other gripping head (62) is set so that it is greater than the length of the spar 
element (2). 
The method of claim 12, characterised in that a fastening flange (30) with 
fastening pins (32) axially parallel with the spar axis (42) is used as a 

fastening member, and the unidirectional fibres are wrapped over the 
fastening flange and reversed about the fastening pins.
