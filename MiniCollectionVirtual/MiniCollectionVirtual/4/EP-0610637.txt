<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an impermeable elastic membrane for a hydropneumatic accumulator. This membrane is characterised in that it is produced either from an impermeable film obtained by extrusion, or directly by injection or moulding under pressure, of polyvinyl alcohol which is totally hydrolysed, of high molecular mass and plasticised. Application to hydropneumatic suspensions for motor vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Impermeable elastic membrane intended to be fitted to
a gas-loaded accumulator in order to separate a gas

compartment and a liquid compartment, characterised in that
it comprises a monolayer of polyvinyl alcohol of high

molecular mass, totally hydrolysed and plasticised with
glycerine, capable of being obtained directly by injection

or pressure moulding, having a constant, controlled
thickness of 450 µm to 1400 µm.
Membrane according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the total hydrolysis of the polyvinyl alcohol is obtained by

the reaction:

Membrane according to Claim 2, characterised in that the totally
hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohol is plasticised with glycerine at a rate of up to 35%.
Membrane according to Claim 3, characterised in that it is obtained by
injection or pressure moulding of polyvinyl alcohol, totally hydrolysed and

plasticised, directly form-moulded.
Membrane according to Claim 4, characterised in that it is moulded at a
pressure of about 150.10
5
 Pa (150 bars) and at a temperature of about 220°C.
Membrane according to Claim 5, characterised in that it is coated with an
appropriate adhesive intended to adhere to rubber. 
Membrane according to Claim 6, characterised in that it is placed between
two protective layers of rubber themselves formed, and it is then vulcanised in

a press for about 12 minutes at 155°C.
