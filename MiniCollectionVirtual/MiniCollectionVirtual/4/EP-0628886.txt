<ABSTRACT>
A conductive separating roller (3) is arranged to be in 
contact with the surface of a transfer sheet (P) electrostatically 

adhering to the surface of a photoreceptor drum (1). The 
charge on the transfer sheet (P) is removed by applying an 

alternating current voltage or a pulse voltage to the separating 
roller (3). The transfer sheet (P) is separated from the 

surface of the photoreceptor drum (1) by its dead load and/or 
its resiliency against being bent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separator for separating 
a transfer sheet from a photoreceptor, and more specifically, to 
a separator for separating an electrostatically adhering 
transfer sheet for use in an image forming apparatus such as an 
electrophotographic copying machine, a printer and a facsimile 
machine. In a conventional electrophotographic copying machine, 
electrostatic transfer is performed to transfer a toner image 
formed on the surface of a photoreceptor to a transfer sheet. 
However, the transfer sheet made to electrostatically adhere to 
the surface of the photoreceptor in the electrostatic transfer 
remains adhering to the surface of the photoreceptor after the 
toner image is transferred to the transfer sheet. To explain the mechanism of the electrostatic adherence of 
the transfer sheet to the surface of the photoreceptor, electrostatic 
transfer of negatively charged toner will be described as 
an example with reference to Fig. 2. As shown in the figure, 
when positive corona discharge is applied from the back surface 
of the transfer sheet P (from the upper part of the figure), the 
surface of the transfer sheet P is charged with positive ions 13 
generated by the corona discharge. Then, a negative charge is 
induced between a photosensitive layer 12 formed on the surface  
 
of a photoreceptor drum 1 and a substrate 11 arranged below the 
layer 12. At this time, the potential of the transfer sheet P 
is several hundreds to several thousands of volts to the 
substrate 11. A positive charge applied at the time of main 
charging remains on the portions of the surface of the photosensitive 
layer 12 where toner 14 is present. The positive charge 
decreases the electrostatic force between the transfer sheet P 
and the photoreceptor drum 1. However, on the portions of the 
photosensitive layer 12 where no toner is present, since the 
positive charge is removed at the time of exposure and a 
negative charge is induced by the corona discharge at the time 
of transfer, a great electrostatic force works between the 
photoreceptor drum 1 and the transfer sheet P. Because of this 
electrostatic force, the transfer sheet P and the surface of the 
photoreceptor drum 1 are in close contact. The strength of the 
electric field therebetween is said to be as high as 100kV/cm at 
the portions where no toner is present. Although this exceeds 
30kV/cm which is the withstand voltage of normal air gaps, no 
discharge occurs since the gap is very small. Various electrostatic separators
