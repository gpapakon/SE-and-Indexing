Device for storing a missile (8) in a launching tube (6), with the 
launching tube (6) being stored in a launcher unit (1), 


characterised in that
 at the front and at the rear of the launching 
tube (6) respectively are at least one adjustable and sprung 

mounting point (11, 31) and at least two fixed mounting points (12, 
32), and that the front mounting points (11, 12) act on support pins 

(10), and the rear mounting points (31, 32) act on slide webs (35), 
and the mounting points (11, 12, 31, 32) are supported on the 

structure of the launcher unit (1) on frames (3, 4). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at the front 
and rear respectively are both two adjustable and sprung 

mounting points (11, 31) and two fixed mounting points (12, 32). 
Device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
front adjustable and sprung mounting point (11) has a housing 

(20) which is located within the launching tube (6) and into which 
is screwed an adjustment screw (21) which passes from the 

outside through the launching tube (6) and which supports itself by 
means of a locking plate (23) against a flange plate (22) which is 

externally seated on the launching tube (6), and into the adjusting 
screw (21) is inserted a pressure element (25) which acts with a 

collar (25b) on one of the support pins (10), and the pressure 
element (25) is mounted to be movable with a holding pin (26) in 

the adjustment screw (21) via an elongated hole (25a), and 
between the collar (25b) of the pressure element (25) and the 

adjustment screw (21) is inserted a pretensioned spring (27). 
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
, after playfree 
setting of the missile (8) in the launching tube (6), the adjustment 

screw (21) is secured against rotation by a locking screw (24) in

Device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
rear adjustable and sprung mounting point (31) comprises a 

housing (36), which is inserted into the launching tube (6) and  
 

supported with a flange between the frame (4) of the launcher 
unit (1) and the launching tube (6) and into which is screwed an 

adjustment screw (37) which accommodates within itself a 
pressure element (41) which acts against one of the glide webs 

(35), and the pressure element (41) is attached by means of a 
holding pin (42) in the adjusting screw (37) via an elongated hole 

(41) and a pretensioned spring (43) is inserted between the 
pressure element (41) and the adjustment screw (37). 
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
, after playfree 
setting of the missile (8) in the launching tube (6), the adjustment 

screw (37) is secured by a locking plate (38) and a holding screw 
(39).

flange plate (22) of the front adjustable and sprung mounting point 

(11) and the head of the fixed mounting point (12) fill the gap 
between the launching tube (6) and the frame (3). 
Device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 a rear 
fixed mounting point (32) is in the shape of an elongated metal 

plate which at the point where a glide web (35) is seated against 
the launching tube (6) is mounted from the outside on the 

launching tube (6) and fills the gap between the launching tube (6) 
and the frame (4).  

 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the rear glide webs (35) are mounted on 
bearings (33) for unfoldable fins (34) of the missile (8).
