<ABSTRACT>
An optical communication system and method are provided which utilize 
dispersion-induced FM to AM conversion with nonlinearity-induced AM 

stabilization. The system and method utilize a frequency modulated optical signal 
transmitter, a fiber span, an optical receiver which receives the transmitted optical 

signal and detects an AM signal resulting from dispersion-induced energy overlaps 
and voids in the optical signal, and one or more in-line amplifiers spaced within the 

optical fiber span. By adjusting the number, position and/or output power levels of 
the in-line amplifiers, stabilization of the energy voids and overlaps and resulting 

AM signal can be achieved, yielding a substantial increase in achievable 
transmission distance at a given bit rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improvements in optical 
communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to optical 
communication using FM to AM conversion induced by fiber chromatic dispersion. Optical communication typically involves transmitting high bit rate digital 
data over silica glass fiber by modulating a laser or other optical source. Glass 
fibers have a very broad bandwidth, on the order of 40,000 THz, and can therefore 
in theory support total data rates on the order of 20,000 Tbits/sec. However, the 
practical fiber transmission capability is limited by system constraints, among the 
most important of which are the chromatic dispersion and nonlinearities of the 
optical fiber itself. Although optical fiber also attenuates the transmitted signal, at a 
rate of about 0.2 dB per km, the development of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers 
(EDFAs) has essentially eliminated fiber attenuation as an obstacle to achieving 
longer transmission distances. Chromatic dispersion, often simply called dispersion, refers to a 
phenomenon in which the speed of an optical signal through the fiber varies as a 
function of the optical signal frequency or wavelength in standard single-mode 
fibers. For wavelengths below about 1.3 µm, longer wavelengths travel faster than 
shorter ones, and the resulting dispersion is commonly referred to as normal 
dispersion Above 1.3 µm, shorter wavelengths travel faster than longer ones, and 
the dispersion is referred to as anomalous dispersion. Dispersion is typically 
expressed in units of picoseconds per kilometer-nanometer (ps/km-nm), indicating 
the number of picoseconds a pulse with a bandwidth of 1 nanometer will spread in 
time by propagating over 1 kilometer of fiber.  One important fiber nonlinearity is the Kerr effect, in which the index of 
refraction increases with the intensity of the applied optical signal. Changes in the 
fiber index of refraction modulate the phase of a signal passing through the fiber 
and thereby impose a frequency chirp which redistributes the signal frequency 
spectrum. This phenomenon is known as self-phase modulation in single channel 
systems in which the optical signal modulates itself. In multi-channel systems, in 
which one signal causes modulation of other signals, the phenomenon is referred to 
as either cross-phase modulation or four-photon mixing. Lower frequencies are 
placed at the leading edge of an optical signal pulse and higher frequencies are 
placed toward the trailing edge. Changes in
