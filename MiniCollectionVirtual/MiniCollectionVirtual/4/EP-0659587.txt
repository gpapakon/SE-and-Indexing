<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a security paper (1) having a security element (2) in the form of a thread or tape which consists of a translucent plastic film (6, 10) having at least partially opaque coating. The coating has translucent regions in the form of visually and/or machine-readable characters or patterns which form a first item of information. Arranged additionally on the plastic film (6, 10) is a second item of information (8, 18, 12) in the form of visually and/or machine-readable characters or patterns which differ from the first item of information with respect to their size and/or their visual impression.

<CLAIMS>
An antifalsification paper having a security element in the form of a thread 
or band which consists of a transparent plastic film with an at least partly opaque 

coating, the coating having transparent areas in the form of visually and/or machine 
readable characters or patterns which form a first information portion, characterized 

in that the first information portion (13) is visually recognizable without aids, and 
the coating has a second information portion (12) in the form of characters or patterns 

likewise formed by gaps in the opaque coating (4), the second information 
portion being harder to resolve visually due to its smaller size compared to the first 

information portion. 
The antifalsification paper of claim 1, characterized in that the first and second 
information portions (12, 13) are disposed alternatingly along the security element 

(2). 
The antifalsification paper of at least one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the first and second information portions (12, 13) are disposed parallel to each 

other along the security element (2). 
The antifalsification paper of at least one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the width of the security element (2) is varied, regarded in the running direction. 
The antifalsification paper of at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the opaque coating (4) is a metallic-looking print or a vacuum metalization. 
The antifalsification paper of at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the security element (2) is embedded in said paper as a window thread. 
A security element to be embedded in an antifalsification paper in the form 
of a thread or band which consists of a transparent plastic film with an at least partly 

opaque coating, the coating having transparent areas in the form of visually and/or 
machine readable characters or patterns which form a first information portion, characterized 

in that the first information portion (13) is visually recognizable without 
aids, and the coating has a second information portion (12) in the form of characters 

or patterns likewise formed by gaps in the opaque coating (4), the second information 
portion being harder to resolve visually due to its smaller size compared to the 

first information portion.
