<ABSTRACT>
A plastics injection machine for large shot vols. comprises a plasticising and injection unit (1) coupled with and either parallel to or inclined to an ante-chamber injection unit (2). Both units (1,2) are coupled at the front ends by a flange (4) which holds a second flange (5) and injection nozzle (3). The injection axes (1.6, 2.7) of both units (1,2) are the same distance from and on either side of the injection nozzle axis (3.2) within the flange (4). Melt collection chambers (4.2, 4.5) in front of the injection units (1,2) have shut-off valves (4.3, 4.6) and chambers (4.33, 4.64) behind the valves (4.3, 4.6) in the flow direction are linked by radial channels (5.2, 5.3) in the flange (5), to the nozzle channel (3.3). A control device (5.4) shuts off the radial channel (5.3) between the nozzle (3) and the ante-chamber unit (2). A collecting chamber (2.22) in front of the ante-chamber unit piston is connected by a channel (4,7) parallel to the injection axis (3.2) to the radi al channel (5.3) between the control device (5.4) and the injection axis (2.7) of the ante-chamber unit (2). A non-return valve (4.8) is located in the connecting channel (4.7).

Plastics spraying unit for large spraying volumes,
consisting of a plasticizing and injection assembly and

an antechamber injection unit which are mechanically
detachable, parallel or at an acute angle relative to

one another and connected to one another, the
plasticising and injection assembly consists of a

plasticizing cylinder with an axially displaceable
plasticizing worm and the antechamber spraying unit of

a mass cylinder with axially displaceable injection
plunger, the collection compartments upstream of the

worm tip of the plasticizing and injection assembly and
upstream of the injection plunger of the ante-chamber

injection unit are connectable to one another via bores
and channels and separable from one another by shutoff

devices accommodated in the bores and the two
collection compartments are connected via bores and

channels to a nozzle channel of an injection nozzle in
a central spraying axis, characterised in that


the plasticizing and injection assembly (1) and
the antechamber injection unit (2) are connected

detachably to one another at the front end by a
flange element (4) and, adjacent thereto, a second

flange element (5) is detachably secured, on which
the injection nozzle (3) is detachably disposed,
the injection axes (1.6, 2.7) of the plasticising
and injection assembly (1) and the antechamber

injection unit (2) are at the end where they issue
in the flange element (4) disposed at

approximately the same distance opposite the
central injection axis (3.2) of the injection

nozzle (3),
the collection compartments (4.2, 4.5) upstream of
the plasticizing and injection assembly (1) and

the antechamber injection unit (2) can be shut off 
by check valves (4.3, 4.6) disposed in counter

direction to the flow direction and there are
provided downstream of the shut-off elements of

the check valves (4.3, 4.6) valve chambers (4.33,
4.64) which are connected via radial connecting

channels (5.2, 5.3) in the flange element (5) to
the nozzle channel (3.3) of the injection nozzle

(3) in the central injection axis (3.2),
the radial connecting channel (5.3) between the
central injection axis (3.2) and the antechamber

injection unit (2) can be shut off by means of an
actuator (5.4) and the collection compartment

(2.22) of the antechamber injection unit (2) is
connected via a connecting bore (4.7) disposed

axially parallel with the central injection axis
(3.2) to the radial connecting channel (5.3)

between the actuator (5.4) and the injection axis
(2.7) of the antechamber injection unit (2) and a

check valve (4.8) is so disposed in the axially
parallel connecting bore (4.7) that the mass flow

out of the collection compartment (2.22) of the
antechamber injection unit (2) into the connecting

channel (5.3) is inhibited.
Spraying unit according to claim 1, characterised in
that the spray plunger (2.2) of the antechamber

injection unit (2) is formed in two stages upstream of
its sealing piston (2.21) and the piston with the

greater diameter (D) forms together with the bore
(2.11) in the mass cylinder, the sealing piston (2.21)

and the flange element (4) a first collection chamber
(2.22) shaped as an annular channel, in which the

connecting bore (4.7) issues from the radial connecting
channel (5.3), and the piston with the smaller diameter

(d) is taken up by a bore (4.4) in the flange element
(4) and forms with the latter at the front end a second 

collection compartment (4.5), which is connected to the
first collection compartment (2.22) via an axial bore

(2.24) and a radial bore (2.23) in the spray plunger
(2.2).
Spraying unit according to claim 2, characterised in
that the opening of the radial bore (2.23) in the

spraying plunger (2) is disposed opposite the point
where the connecting bore (4.7) issues into the first

collection compartment (2.22).
Spraying unit according to claims 1 and 3,
characterised in that the connecting bore (4.7) has a

cross-section which is substantially smaller than the
cross-section of the bore (4.41) upstream of the check

valve (4.6) of the ante-chamber injection unit (2),
wherein the check valve (4.8) in the connecting bore

(4.7) is omitted.
