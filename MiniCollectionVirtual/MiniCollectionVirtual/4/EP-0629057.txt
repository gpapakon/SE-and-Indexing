<ABSTRACT>
In an optical soliton transmission system an optical transmitter (2) 
generating short pulses is coupled to a glass fibre cable (4) comprising sections of glass 

fibre (7, 9, 11, 13, 15) with interspaced semiconductor laser amplifiers (8, 10, 12, 14). 
An optical receiver (6) is connected to the end of the glass fibre cable (15). In optical 

soliton transmission Erbium doted fibre amplifiers and dispersion shifted fibre are 
currently used in the 1.5 µm wavelength region. However, by utilizing standard fibre in 

the 1.3 µm wavelength region it is possible to use a lower soliton power compared with 
a state-of-the-art transmission system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical soliton transmission system comprising a
transmitter which includes a laser for generating optical pulses having energy suitable for
generating solitons, the transmitter being coupled to a first end of a glass fibre in which at
least an optical amplifier is included, a second end of the glass fibre in this transmission
system being coupled to an optical receiver for detecting solitons.The invention likewise relates to a glass fibre cable to be used in a
transmission system of this type.A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from the
journal article "Long-Distance Soliton Propagation Using Lumped Amplifiers and
Dispersion Shifted Fibre" by L.F. Mollenauer et. al. in IEEE Journal of Lightwave
Technology, vol. 9, no. 2, February 1991.In optical transmission systems for information transport over large
distances, such as, for example, between different continents, an optical transmitter
comprising a laser is used for converting a digital electric signal into optical pulses. These
pulses are transported through the glass fibre to an optical receiver and reconverted into a
digital electric signal.In the glass fibre the transmitted pulses are attenuated by the attenuation of
the glass fibre. In addition, the width of the transmitted pulses increases as the length of the
glass fibre increases. This pulse widening is caused by the fact that the delay in the glass fibre
for light having different wavelengths is different. This property of a glass fibre is called
dispersion. Since a light pulse transmitted by the optical transmitter always contains
components having different wavelengths, certain components of the light pulse will arrive
earlier at the optical receiver than components having a different wavelength, so that the
optical pulses are widened.To reduce the detrimental effects of attenuation and pulse widening, so-called
regenerative repeaters are included at regular distances in the glass fibre. Such a
repeater receives light pulses from the glass fibre and converts them into a digital electric
signal. This digital electric signal is then reconverted into optical pulses having the original
width. If a sufficient number of repeaters is included in the transmission system, a good
transmission quality is possible over large distances. The required regenerative repeaters,
however, are rather complicated, which leads to high costs of the transmission system. In the transmission system known from said journal article, much more cost-effective
