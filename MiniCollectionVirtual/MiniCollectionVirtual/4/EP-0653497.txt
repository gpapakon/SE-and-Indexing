<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a support for a planographic 
printing plate, which comprises after continuous casting an 

aluminum plate having a thickness of not more than 3 mm from 
molten aluminum by a twin roller continuous casting method, 

heat-treating the aluminum plate and then reducing the 
thickness of the plate to 0.5 mm or less by cold rolling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing a support for planographic printing plate and more 
particularly relates to a method of producing an aluminum 
support which is superior in an electrolytically graining 
property. As an aluminum support for printing plate, 
particularly for offset printing plate there is used an 
aluminum plate (including aluminum alloy plate). In general, an aluminum plate to be used as a support 
for offset printing plate needs to have a proper adhesion to 
a photographic light-sensitive material and a proper water 
retention. The surface of the aluminum plate should be uniformly 
and finely grained to meet the aforesaid requirements. This 
graining process largely affects a printing performance and a 
durability of the printing plate upon the printing process 
following manufacture of the plate. Thus, it is important 
for the manufacture of the plate whether such graining is 
satisfactory or not. In general, an alternating current electrolytic 
graining method is used as the method of graining an aluminum  
 
support for a printing plate. There are a variety of 
suitable alternating currents, for example, a normal 
alternating waveform such as a sinewaveform, a special 
alternating waveform such as a squarewaveform, and the like. 
When the aluminum support is grained by alternating current 
supplied between the aluminum plate and an opposite electrode 
such as a graphite electrode, this graining is usually 
conducted only one time, as the result of which, the depth of 
pits formed by the graining is small over the whole surface 
thereof. Also, the durability of the grained printing plate 
during printing will deteriorate. Therefore, in order to 
obtain a uniformly and closely grained aluminum plate 
satisfying the requirement of a printing plate with deep pits 
as compared with their diameters, a variety of methods have 
been proposed as follows. One method is a graining method to use a current of 
particular waveform for an electrolytic power source (JP-A-53-67507). 
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application".) Another 
method is to control a ratio between an electricity quantity 
of a positive period and that of a negative period at the 
time of alternating electrolytic graining (JP-A-54-65607). 
Still another method is to control the waveform supplied from 
an electrolytic power source (JP-A-55-25381). Finally, 
another method is directed to a combination of current 
density (JP-A-56-29699).
