<ABSTRACT>
A method including a preheating stage wherein 
rheocast light alloy ingots are preheated to a 

temperature within the solidification range of the 
alloy; and a die casting stage wherein a mold is filled 

with the semiliquid alloy. The preheating stage is 
performed in a forced-convection-heated tunnel furnace, 

with the ingots housed inside cup-shaped containers 
which, following a temperature check, are tipped by a 

robot to unload the ingots into the injection chamber of 
a die casting machine. Work is conducted within a 

temperature range depending on the composition of the 
alloy, and such that, at the minimum permissible 

injection temperature, the ingot is incapable of 
maintaining its own shape, and, at the maximum 

permissible injection temperature, the apparent 
viscosity of the ingot is such as to ensure the mold is 

filled under laminar flow conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
system for low-cost, reliable semiliquid die casting of
high performance mechanical components, particularly
vehicle injection system parts, from rheocast light
alloy ingots.Italian Patent n. 1.119.287 filed on 20 June,
1979, and entitled: "Process and device for preparing a
metal alloy mixture comprising a solid and liquid
phase", the content of which is incorporated herein
purely by way of reference as required, relates to a
static mixer for bringing a metal alloy into a
"semiliquid" state in which the alloy, though already
within the solidification range, can be cast, and
presents a homogeneous composition and appearance as
though still fully liquid.More recent studies (R.L. Antona - R. Moschini:
Met. Sci. Technol., 1986, vol.4 (2), p. 49-59; M. C.
Flemings: Met. Transactions B, June 1991, vol.22 (B), p.
269-293) have shown that, when solidified, semiliquid 
cast light alloys - known as "rheocast" alloys - present
a characteristic microstructure - a globular as opposed
to the normal dendritic structure - resulting in a
characteristic behaviour of the alloy when restored to a
temperature within the solidification range. More
specifically, rheocast alloys with a globular structure
tend to segregate eutectic liquid and reassume a
semiliquid state in which the alloy presents a
characteristic "dessert cream" consistency.In the "semiliquid" state, rheocast alloys have
also been found to be pseudoplastic in the sense that
viscosity varies (decreases) alongside a variation
(increase) in the applied shear rate. According to
Italian Patent Application n. TO91A000299 filed on
10.04.1991 by the present Applicant and entitled:
"Process for producing high mechanical performance die
castings via injection of a semiliquid metal alloy", the
content of which is incorporated herein purely by way of
reference as required, the pseudoplastic behaviour of
rheocast alloys is exploited for producing good quality,
sound die castings from semiliquid alloys.Transferring semiliquid die casting technology to
mass production, however, presents more than a few
problems. Foremost of these is the difficulty in
ensuring continuous supply of the die casting machine
with ingots within a suitable temperature range, to
prevent no-load injection and hence damage to the
machine for lack of the ingot, and to prevent the alloy 
from being injected in less than optimum rheological
conditions (due to over- or underheating), the latter
being a fairly common occurrence due to the widely
varying

A method of producing high mechanical
performance components from rheocast ingots via

semiliquid die casting of a metal alloy; the method
comprising a stage consisting in preheating the rheocast

ingots to a temperature within the solidification range

state; and a die casting stage wherein a mold is filled
with the alloy in the semiliquid state; the preheating

stage being performed in a furnace with the ingots
housed inside respective cup-shaped containers;

characterized in that:

the preheating stage is performed in a
forced-convection-heated furnace; and
the preheated ingots are withdrawn from the furnace,
and, by gripping the respective said cup-shaped

container, are transferred to a die casting machine and
tipped into the injection chamber of the die casting

machine by tipping the container and after first
controlling the temperature of the alloy by immersing a

thermocouple in the respective ingot during transfer;

that, at the minimum permissible injection temperature,
the ingot begins to be visibly incapable of maintaining

its shape, and, at the maximum permissible injection
temperature, the apparent viscosity of the ingot is such 

as to ensure the mold is filled under laminar flow
