<ABSTRACT>
Flue gas (12) is desulphurized using a bioregenerated reagent 
(224) in a system in which the flue gas (12), reagent (204) and water 

(52) are provided to an absorber (202) for producing a reaction in 
order for the reagent to absorb sulphur from the flue gas (12). The 

spent reagent (208) from the absorber (202) is provided to a digester 
reactor (210) wherein sulphur-reducing bacteria are used to regenerate 

the reagent. Gases produced by the digester reactor (210), such as H₂S, 
are collected by a gas collector (214) for further processing. A 

separator (220) is used to separate the product (212) produced in the 
digester reactor (210) into regenerated reagent (224) and organic 

solids (222) so that the regenerated reagent (224) can be provided back 
into the absorber (202). A nutrient source (228) such as organic waste 

sludge from municipal waste water treatment plants can be used to 
promote growth of the sulphur-reducing bacteria. Means are provided to 

monitor and control various parameters affecting bacterial growth, such 
as temperature (230), pH (232), oxygen content (234), and flow rate 

(236) of the nutrient into the digester reactor (210).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to systems and methods
for flue gas desulphurization (FGD) and, in particular, to such systems
and methods using a regenerative reagent produced by biological means.The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal or oil commonly
produces flue gas that contains sulphur based compounds such as sulphur
dioxide (SO2), sulphur trioxide (SO3) and other contaminants. A number
of methods or systems are used to remove or decrease the sulphur
content of the flue gas. Many of these systems or processes involve
the use of a regenerated reagent to desulphurize the flue gas.
Regenerable reagent processes for the desulphurization of flue gas
include sodium based systems and processes such as the Wellman-Lord
process, the Citrate process, Amine-based processes, and the MgO
process.Wet regenerable FGD processes generally include an absorption
step in which fresh or regenerated reagent is reacted with SO2 in a
scrubber to clean and desulphurize the flue gas. The SO2 absorption
reaction produces products which are sent to a regeneration system
which generally requires the addition of heat in order to produce an SO2
rich gas. This SO2 rich gas is then further treated to produce sulphur,
sulphuric acid, or liquid SO2. The reagent used during the absorption
process is then regenerated for further use in the SO2 absorption
process. The reactions involved in the SO2 absorption and stripping
processes are very complex. Because of their complexity, these
reactions require a great amount of energy to proceed to completion.Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings is a simplified schematic
diagram of a known regenerable wet flue gas desulphurization system 10
which employs the Wellman-Lord process. As shown therein, flue gas 12
from a boiler or combustor 14 is provided to a prescrubber 16 to remove
flyash and chlorides. The flyash is collected in a water slurry 18
that is transported to a settling pond 20 before discharge.
Prescrubbed flue gas 22 is directed to an absorber 24 for removal of
sulphur dioxide (SO2). A sodium sulphite (Na2SO3) solution 26 is
provided from a make up tank 28 to the absorber 24 for this purpose.
Cleaned, saturated flue gas 30 leaves the absorber 24 and is sent to a 
reheater 32 prior to discharge into the atmosphere via a stack 34.
Steam 36 may be used to accomplish this reheating step. In the
absorber 24, the sodium sulphite is converted to sodium bisulphite
(NaHSO3) 38 which is sent to a regenerator 40. As necessary, a small
portion of the sodium bisulphite 38 is purged
