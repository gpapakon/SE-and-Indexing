<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a handcart with a platform plate (10), side walls (15) and a removable front and rear wall (16.1, 16.2), the platform plate (10) being placed on a rectangular frame (2) which has a rear axle (4) at the rear, under the end regions, and at the front has a front axle (5) which can be pivoted around a [lacuna] in a central swivel pin (11) and has a draw bar (8). In order to develop a handcart of this type in such a manner that it is substantially easier to handle in particular for transportation in motor vehicles and can be used for the transportation of bulky goods, it is proposed that the frame (2) is connected to the rear axle (4) via supports (3.1, 3.2) fastened directly on or to it and is connected to the front axle with its swivel pin via supports (3.3, 3.4) which are angled in an L shape, the supports (3.1, 3.2, 3,3, 3.4) being fastened from the inside to the frame (2) such that they protrude beyond the frame (2) by the thickness of this platform plate (10) and terminate flush with the platform plate (10) placed on said frame and at least in the upwards region are designed as tubes with plug-in openings (13.1, 13.2) for plug-in means provided on the side walls.
