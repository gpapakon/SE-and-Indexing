<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to parenteral
solutions containing 3-dialkylaminoethoxybenzoylbenzofurans
having the following structural formula:

wherein R1 is alkyl, R2 is hydrogen or methyl, NR3 is
dimethylamino, diethylamino, dipropylamino, piperidino,
pyrrolidino or morpholino, and Y and Y1 are the same or
different and represent hydrogen, iodo- or bromo-. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a parenteral
solution suitable for intravenous administration containing
as active ingredient 2-n-butyl-3-(3,5-diiodo-4-β-N-diethylaminoethoxybenzoyl)
benzofuran (hereinafter
amiodarone).Amiodarone has been approved in an oral tablet form
(CORDARONE®) for the treatment of life-threatening
ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the United States since
1985. This drug is useful not only in treating these
arrhythmias but also in treating less severe ventricular
arrhythmias and many supraventricular arrhythmias including
atrial fibrillation and reentrant tachyarrhythmias
involving accessory pathways.To treat arrhythmias, the compound may be administered
in oral dosage forms such as in the form of a 200 mg 
tablet, or it may be administered in the form of an
intravenous solution. Please see, for example, Escoubet,
B. et al., "Suppression of Arrhythmias Within Hours After
Single Oral Dose of Amiodarone and Relation to Plasma and
Myocardial Concentrations", Am. J. Cardiol., (1985),
55:696-702, Mostow et al., "Rapid suppression of Complex
Ventricular Arrhythmias With High-Dose Oral Amiodarone",
Circulation, (1986), 73:1231-8, Morady et al., "Intravenous
Amiodarone in the Acute Treatment of Recurrent symptomatic
Ventricular Tachycardia", Am. J. Cardiol., (1983), 51:156-9
and Kadish et al. "The Use of Intravenous Amiodarone in the
Acute Therapy of Life-Threatening Tachyarrhythmias".
Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, (1989), 31:4, 281-294.Amiodarone is soluble in a variety of organic solvents
such as benzene, toluene, ethanol and ethyl acetate. See,
for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,791,137. However,
amiodarone is practically insoluble or slightly soluble in
an aqueous solvent. Hence, it is difficult to formulate a
dosage form suitable for intravenous administration. To
aid the dissolution in water, for example, a surfactant has
been suggested. Thus, the prior art intravenous dosage
form for this compound termed I.V. Cordarone, comprises
amiodarone dissolved in a solvent comprising polysorbate 80
available under the tradename Tween-80, and benzyl alcohol.
Prior art intravenous solutions of amiodarone will be
