<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Battery Pack arrangements and more 
generally to packs for energy storage devices. Many types of battery pack are in common use, some of the most common 
being rechargeable power supplies for portable equipment such as, for 
example, camcorders, mobile phones and notebook computers. Typically, 
such a pack comprises a battery of cells, a casing to protect and contain the 
cells; means for interconnecting the cells within the casing and conductors 
running from the interconnected cells to external terminations. The casing 
shape and termination placement may be such that it mates both electrically 
and physically with external equipment such as that exemplified above and. 
in the case of a rechargeable pack, a charger. Also included within the pack 
is a thermally sensitive circuit breaker which serves to disconnect the cells in 
the event of excessive cell temperatures. EP-A-0 524 377 discloses a removable measurement device for monitoring the 
battery condition of large batteries used in traction motor applications. A central 
section of a cell connector is used as a measurement resistance for sensing 
current flow. GB-A-2 219 151 discloses a permanently attached measurement device for a 
battery pack that stores time related patterns of charge and discharge current, 
voltage, temperature and pressure. A Hall generator is used to sense current flow. Presently, it is being proposed to include some control or monitoring means 
within a battery pack. Such an arrangement might provide for charge 
current control during recharge, charge monitoring during discharge and 
charge (for a rechargeable pack), display of battery condition and possibly 
transmission of battery condition or other parameters to external equipment. 
Such arrangements are described in European Patent Application 
92402955.6. In one such arrangement, the control means can be 
implemented using a micro-computer of the micro-controller type. 
Arrangements of this type are sometimes referred to as "intelligent battery 
packs". According to the present invention in one aspect thereof, there is provided a 
battery pack arrangement as claimed in the claims appended hereto. Other 
features of the invention will also be apparent from what follows.  
 In order that features and advantages of the present invention may be more 
fully appreciated, an embodiment will now be described, by way of example 
only and with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings of 
which: 
Figure 1 represents an intelligent
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An intelligent battery pack having at least two cells (21), a cell interconnection 
strap (22), a current sense element (309) formed as part of the cell 

interconnection strap, a control module (305), and a container (304,20) to enclose 
the battery pack, characterized
 
   in that the control module (305) comprises a printed circuit board 

which forms a portion of the container,
 
   in that circuit components (4001-4006) on the printed circuit board occupy 

inter-cellular space, and
 
   in that the interconnection strap (22) is of unitary construction while 

having a portion therein of increased electrical resistance (309) which forms the 
current sense element (309), the interconnection strap having extension posts 

(300,301) connecting the control module across the resistive portion of increased 
electrical resistance of the interconnection strap. 
A battery pack as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the portion 
of increased electrical resistance (309) is formed as a portion of reduced 

width of the interconnection strap. 
A battery pack as claimed in any one of the preceding claims and 
characterized in that the current sense element (309) is in thermal contact with 

one or more of the cells (21) so that the one or more cells act as a heat sink for 
the sense element.
