<ABSTRACT>
A cooling apparatus for integrated circuit chips (112) in 
which the pressure of coolant does not affect the chips (112) is 

disclosed. A block (121) is provided with a plurality of holes. 
Cooling members (131) are inserted in these holes. An 

elastic member (134) is filled between the block (121) and 
the cooling member (131). The cooling member (131) is 

supported to the block (121) by the elastic member (134). 
Each cooling member (131) is connected to each other by pipes 

(132). A bellows (133) can be provided between the cooling 
member (131) and the pipe (132). When the block (121) is 

loaded on the substrate (111) on which the integrated circuit 
chips (112) are mounted, the elastic member (134) deforms and 

the cooling member (131) displaces in accordance with the 
height and inclination of the integrated circuit chip (112). 

The lower surface of the cooling member (131) is brought into 
close contact with the integrated circuit chip (112) due to 

the deformation of the elastic member (134). The bellows 
(133) deforms in accordance with the displacement of the 

cooling member (131) to ensure the normal connection of the 
pipe (132). When the coolant is supplied, the expanded 

bellows (133) pushes the pipe (132) up but does not push the 
cooling member (131) down.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid cooling
apparatus for integrated circuit chips, more particularly, to
a cooling apparatus in which integrated circuit chips are
cooled with cooling members in contact with the chips.An example of a cooling apparatus incorporating cooling
members is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5 023 695. In the
structure shown in Fig. 3 of this patent, a cooling module 4
corresponds to the cooling member. The cooling module 4 is
provided with a cavity 13. Cooling fluid is injected into
the cavity 13.In such cooling apparatus, the cooling member has to be
in close contact with the integrated circuit chip. A gap
between the cooling member and the integrated circuit chip
decreases the cooling efficiency of the apparatus.One of the factors preventing the contact of the cooling
member and the integrated circuit chip is a difference in
height between the integrated circuit chips. If an
integrated circuit chip is low in height, the gap between the
cooling member and the integrated circuit chip is wide.
Another factor preventing the contact of the cooling member
and the integrated circuit chip is inclination of the
integrated circuit chip. If an integrated circuit chip is 
inclined, the cooling member contacts only partially with the
integrated circuit chip. These factors can be eliminated by
precisely adjusting the height and inclination of the cooling
member.However, when a plurality of integrated circuit chips is
cooled, it is difficult to make the cooling members in close
contact with the corresponding integrated circuit chips
because the height and inclination of each integrated circuit
chip is different. In the structure described in U.S. Patent
No. 5 023 695, the cooling module 4 is composed of one
member. For this reason, the cooling module 4 can not be
adjusted to the height and inclination of each integrated
circuit chip.A cooling apparatus capable of solving such a problem
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4 644 385. In the structure
shown in Fig. 1 of the patent, the cooling member 1 is
arranged independently to each of chips 2. The cooling
members 1 are connected to each other with pipes. In this
structure, each cooling member 1 becomes in close contact
with the corresponding chip 2 regardless of the height and
inclination of chip 2. Because the cooling members 1 are
connected to each other through the bellows 12, the position and
inclination of them can be changed freely. As a result, each
of the cooling members 1 is brought in close contact with the
corresponding chip 2. As
