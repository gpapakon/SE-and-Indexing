<ABSTRACT>
A process for operating a palladium oxide-containing catalytic combustor is useful, e.g., for powering a gas turbine. The palladium oxide is supported on a metal oxide such as alumina, lanthanide metal oxide-modified alumina, ceria, titania or tantalum oxide. The method involves maintaining control of the temperature within the combustor in such a manner as to insure the presence of palladium oxide. By maintaining the temperature below the decomposition onset temperature of palladium oxide (which is catalytically active for catalytic combustion) into metallic palladium (which is catalytically inactive) deactivation of the catalyst is avoided and high catalytic activity is retained. Regeneration of catalyst following inactivation resulting from an over-temperature is accomplished by using a heat soak in a regeneration temperature range which varies depending on the particular metal oxide used to support the palladium oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a particularly advantageous
process for the catalytically supported combustion
of carbonaceous materials, including natural gas and
methane. In a more specific aspect, this invention relates
to a process for catalytically-supported combustion
of natural gas or methane using a supported palladium oxide
catalyst, without the formation of substantial amounts
of nitrogen oxides.Burning of carbonaceous fuels is associated with formation
of air pollutants, among the most troublesome of
which are nitrogen oxides (NOx). Nitrogen oxides form
whenever air-supported combustion takes place at open
flame temperatures. One approach to eliminating nitrogen
oxides involves chemically modifying the oxides after
their formation. This approach has drawbacks, including
the high cost associated with attempting to eliminate 100%
of a once-formed pollutant. A more direct method of eliminating
nitrogen oxides is to operate the combustion process
at a lower temperature so that no formation of nitrogen
oxide occurs. Such low temperature combustion can
take place in the presence of catalysts, and it is to such
a low temperature combustion process that this invention
is directed.In general, conventional adiabatic, thermal combustion
systems (e.g., gas turbine engines) operate at such 
high temperatures in the combustion zone that undesirable
nitrogen oxides, especially NO, are formed. A thermal
combustion system operates by contacting fuel and air in
flammable proportions with an ignition source, e.g., a
spark, to ignite the mixture which will then continue to
burn. Flammable mixtures of most fuels burn at relatively
high temperatures, i.e., about 3300°F (1816°C) and above, which inherently
results in the formation of substantial amounts
of NOx. In the case of gas turbine combustors, the formation
of NOx can be reduced by limiting the residence time
of the combustion products in the combustion zone. However,
due to the large quantities of gases being handled,
undesirable quantities of NOx are nonetheless produced.It has long been realized that little or no NOx is
formed in a system which catalytically burns a fuel at
relatively low temperatures as compared to uncatalyzed
thermal combustion. Typically, such catalytic combustion
of natural gas or methane, for example, utilizes a pre-burner
or thermal combustor which employs flame combustion
to preheat combustion air to a temperature of 700°C or
higher. Once the catalyst is sufficiently hot to sustain
catalysis, the preburner is shut down and all the
