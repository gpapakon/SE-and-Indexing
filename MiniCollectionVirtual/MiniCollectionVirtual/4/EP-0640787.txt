<ABSTRACT>
A branch pipe lining method of the invention 
utilizes a branch pipe liner bag (4) impregnated with a 

hardenable resin and having a flange (4a) at one end 
thereof, wherein the flange is folded out and mounted to 

a fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7); the branch pipe 
liner bag is everted and inserted into a branch pipe 

(2); an upper end of the branch pipe liner bag is pulled 
up by a rope (24) or the like with the flange (4a) 

thereof being secured on the inner wall of the main pipe 
(1); the fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7) is removed 

from the branch pipe liner bag; a sealing pressure bag 
(16) introduced into the main pipe (1) is expanded to 

seal a lower opening of the branch pipe liner bag (4) 
with the sealing pressure bag; the upper 
end of the 
branch pipe liner bag is closed, and the branch pipe 

liner bag is pressed against the inner wall of the 
branch pipe with a fluid pressure; and the hardenable 

resin impregnated in the branch pipe liner bag is 
hardened while the branch pipe liner bag is continuously 

being pressed against the inner wall of the branch 
pipe. After the lining is completed, the sealing 

pressure bag (16) can be easily removed from the branch 
pipe liner bag (4) after it has been hardened, so that 

any fragment of the sealing pressure bag will not remain 
on the inner wall of the branch pipe (2), with the 

result that the inner wall surface of the branch pipe 
can be maintained in a favourable condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of lining a branch pipe, and more
particularly to a method of lining inner walls of aged or
defective branch pipes.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038 (EP-A-0 155 406).According to the method described in the above-mentioned
Publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the Publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed 
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, pressurized fluid is applied to the
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid presses the
tubular liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular
liner is hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the
rest of the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds
deeper in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall
be called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular
liner bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible
liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the
liner is heated, which is effected by heating the fluid filling
the tubular liner bag by means of hot steam, etc. It is thus
possible to line the inside wall
