<ABSTRACT>
Such methods are usually employed in a substrate-surface inspection machine for the inspection of wafers. In addition to very small particles (in the range of 100 nm) crystal defects, metallic impurities, polishing defects, scratches and other irregularities on wafers can be visualised using devices of this type. In this case, such wafers are inserted, in so-called wafer cassettes (1, 2), before or after inspection into an inspection device and are presented to a gripping system on accurate positioning blocks (3, 4), and are from there loaded using a robotically working swivelling arm (5) onto an inspection platform (7) and measured, the result being evaluated and visualised using complex electronics (8).

Method for non-destructive testing of surfaces, for measuring small particles, defects
and inhomogenities situated on the surface and/or in surface-near regions of an object

under measurement, especially a silicon wafer (3), by means of a light source (20)
generating a light beam, a beam deflecting device (22), a projecting optics providing a

light spot (24) incident perpendicular onto the object under measurement, a
photodetector (7) onto which the converged light is directed, and a device for moving

the object under measurement by coordinate translatoric and rotational movements
such that the complete surface will be scanned spirally by the light spot (24),
characterized in that

scattered light converging means (39, 40, 42) are provided, which are capable to
converge both light scattered under a small angle (83, 84) nearby the optical axis and

light scattered under a great angle (85, 86) with respect to the optical axis, and that
between the beam deflecting device (22) and the light spot (24) of a wafer (3) to be

inspected at least one lens (39, 40) is arranged on the optical axis such that the beams
(83, 84) scattered proximal the axis from the object under measurement are directed to

the sole photodetector (7), and that an elliptical mirror (42) is provided in the same
region of the arrangement, said mirror enclosing the lens(es) (39, 40), serving as a

collecting optical device for distal beams being farer away from the axis, and directing
these beams, too, to the photodetector (7).
Device for non-destructive testing of surfaces, for measuring small particles, defects
and inhomogenities on flat objects of measurement to be inspected, especially silicon

wafers (3), comprising a light source (20) generating a light beam, a beam deflecting
device (22), a light spot (24) incident perpendicular onto the flat object under

measurement, and a transporting device for moving the object under measurement,
