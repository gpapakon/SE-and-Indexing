<ABSTRACT>
In a device for reducing the combustion engine torque between the start and the end of a gearshift sequence of the transmission in motor vehicles with a control module which senses the start of a gearshift sequence and continuously senses the present speed of the internal combustion engine and precalculates the internal combustion engine speed to be anticipated at the end of the gearshift sequence, the reduction of the combustion engine torque between the start and the end of the gearshift sequence is controlled in such a way that a predetermined combustion engine speed curve is achieved.

A method for the reduction of the torque of an internal combustion engine
between the start and the end of a gear shifting process of a drive in motor

vehicles with a control unit, which measures the current revolutions of the
internal combustion engine at the start of a gear shifting process as well as

continuously and calculates in advance the revolutions of the internal
combustion engine to be expected at the end of the gear shifting process,


characterised in that
 the amount of the reduction of the torque of the internal
combustion engine (M
M2
) between the start (t
0
) and the end (t
2
) of the gear
shifting process is controlled in such a manner that an optimised curve of the

internal combustion engine revolutions (v
2
) is obtained, whereby the optimised
curve of the internal combustion engine revolutions (v
2
) is provided in
dependency on the difference (dn) between the measured internal combustion

engine revolutions at the beginning (t0) of the gear shifting process and the
internal combustion engine revolutions (n
neu
) to be expected after the gear
shifting process (t
2
).

arising from a normalised curve of internal combustion engine revolutions in

engine revolutions (n

) of the gear shifting process and the
internal combustion engine revolutions (n

shifting process (t

revolutions is altered in such a way that for large differences (dn) the gear 

shifting time is extended and for small differences (dn) the gear shifting time is
shortened.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the torque of the
coupling to be connected is additionally increased during the gear shifting

process, if the amount of reduction of the internal combustion engine torque
(M

), required to obtain the predetermined curve of internal combustion
engine revolutions (v

) is greater than the maximum possible or maximum
permitted amount.
