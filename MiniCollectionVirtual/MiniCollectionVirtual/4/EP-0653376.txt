<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser for volatile liquids with a vapor collection system is disclosed 
which controls the rate of operation of a vacuum pump 118 so that a simple vacuum intake 

148 disposed preferably inside, but not sealed with, the filler neck can be used to collect only 
the vapors displaced from the fuel tank 110 by the fuel 104. The vacuum pump 118 is 

controlled by a controller 114 which receives, from various sensors 124, 128, 132 and 136, 
signals representative of the fuel vapor/air ratio immediately outside the tank, inside the tank, 

and/or inside the vapor recovery conduit 122, and/or of the pressure relative to atmosphere 
inside the tank 110 and/or of the rate of flow of liquid being dispensed. Based on these input 

signals, the controller 114 operates the vacuum pump 118 at an optimal rate to collect fuel 
vapor displaced from the tank 110.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to volatile liquid dispensers and dispensing systems
of the type used to dispense gasoline into automotive fuel tanks, and more particularly relates
to a method for collecting, during the use of such dispensers, the displaced vapors of the
dispensed liquids, and to a dispenser or dispensing system which includes a vapor collecting
system.As an automobile is being fueled with gasoline at a service station, gasoline flowing
into the fuel tank displaces gasoline vapor which, unless collected, escapes into the
atmosphere. Such vapors not only contribute to atmospheric pollution, but also are
unpleasant to the person operating the nozzle, and may adversely affect the person's health
over a longer term. As a result, some governmental authorities forbid releasing these vapors
into the atmosphere and require collection of any excess vapor for retention and recycling.
In the past, various systems have been proposed and used for collecting and returning these
vapors to a storage vessel, typically the underground storage tank from which the gasoline
is being dispensed. The vapors thus stored are typically then collected for subsequent
disposal by the over-the-road tanker when it delivers additional fuel to the storage tank, or
are disposed of by other means.In one such prior art system, the dispensing pump nozzle is sealed to the fuel tank
filler neck so that the displaced fuel vapor is directed to the underground storage tank by way
of an annular conduit around the nozzle, a coaxial dual conduit hose attached to the nozzle,
and appropriate attached plumbing. The design of the nozzle necessary to effect such a seal
to the fuel tank filler neck has generally involved the addition of a bellows around the nozzle
spout which operates to seal the annular vapor recovery passageway to the filler neck of the
tank, as well as various other modifications which make the hand-held nozzle heavy and
cumbersome, thereby causing the fueling process to be quite difficult, onerous and unreliable,
particularly for the self-serve motorist.The problems relating to sealable bellows nozzles have been somewhat mitigated by
a system which utilizes a vacuum pump to assist in the collection of excess fuel vapor and 
its transfer to the storage tank. As a result of the use of the vacuum pump, it is unnecessary
to seal the vapor recovery passageway to the filler neck of the tank with a bellows, hence
reducing the weight of the nozzle and simplifying the fueling process. In this "bellowless"
system, the vacuum
