<ABSTRACT>
A metal-air power supply which provides improved control over air flow is provided. The reactant air and cooling air inlets are separate from one another and isolated from the exhausted reactant and cooling portions of the air flow, the reactant air flow is limited to a volumetric flow rate sufficient to provide from about 3 to about 10 times the stoichiometric amount of oxygen necessary to produce a predetermined level of current from the cell, and a total volumetric flow rate of air sufficient so that the cooling portion of the air flow has a volumetric flow rate from about 10 to about 1000 times the volumetric flow rate of the reactant portion of the air flow is provided. This limits the flow rate of the reactant air over the cathode, isolates the cooling air flow from the reactant air flow, and maintains the temperature of the metal-air cell at a low level without exposing the air cathode to an excessive air flow rate to reduce the likelihood of drying out the metal-air cells, reduce the exposure of the battery cell to contaminants, and minimize the effects of temperature on the vaporization of water within the cell. In a preferred embodiment, the power supply housing and the metal-air cell case form part of the air plenums. A substantially leak-proof metal-air cell is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrochemical cells. and 
more particularly to metal-air electrochemical cells. There is an increasing need for light-weight. 
high-output power supplies for powering the increasing 
supply of portable electronic equipment such as personal 
computers. Electrochemical cells are commonly used as 
power supplies for a variety of applications but are 
often impractical for use with portable electronic 
equipment because the electrical energy densities of the 
electrochemical cells are too low. In other words, 
conventional electrochemical cells that produce the 
desired power output are often too heavy for use with 
portable equipment. One electrochemical cell that is an exception is the 
metal-air cell. Metal-air cells have a relatively high 
energy density because the cathode of a metal-air cell 
utilizes oxygen from ambient air as a reactant in the 
electrochemical reaction rather than a heavier material  
 
such as a metal or metallic composition. This results in 
a relatively light-weight power supply. Metal-air cells include an air permeable cathode 
and a metallic anode surrounded by an aqueous 
electrolyte. For example, in a zinc-air cell, the anode 
contains zinc, and during operation, oxygen from the 
ambient air is converted at the cathode to hydroxide, 
zinc is oxidized at the anode by the hydroxide, and 
water and electrons are released to provide electrical 
energy. Cells that are useful for only a single discharge 
cycle are called primary cells, and cells that are 
rechargeable and useful for multiple discharge cycles 
are called secondary cells. Both primary and secondary 
metal-air cells have been developed. An electrically 
rechargeable metal-air cell is recharged by applying 
voltage between the anode and cathode of the cell and 
reversing the electrochemical reaction. Oxygen is 
discharged to the atmosphere through the air permeable 
cathode. Metal-air cells are often arranged in multiple cell 
battery packs to provide a sufficient amount of power 
output. In addition, it is often necessary to expose the 
air cathodes of the cells to a continuous flow of air at a 
flow rate sufficient to achieve the desired power output. 
Such an arrangement is shown in U. S. Patent No. 
4,913,983 wherein a fan is used to supply a flow of air 
to a pack of metal-air battery cells. One problem with metal-air cells is that the 
ambient humidity can cause the metal-air cell to fail. 
Equilibrium vapor pressure of the metal-air cell results 
in an equilibrium relative humidity
