<ABSTRACT>
The first component (S1, S2, S3) has a groove (N) on its top (OS). This groove (N) is preferably located on the edge of the top (OS) and is preferably covered by a laminate (L) as an extension of the top. The second component (B1, B2, B3, B4) has a blade-like insertion region (EB). In the case of a first configuration of the invention, stamped studs (P1) in the region of the laminate (L) are introduced into the surface (OS) of the first component (S1, S2, S3) after insertion of the insertion region (EB) of the second component (B1, B2, B3) into the groove (N) (Fig. 1a-4b). In the case of a second embodiment of the invention, the stamped studs (P2) are introduced into the blade-like insertion region (EB) of the second component. The two components (S1, B4) are then fixed, after the insertion region (EB) of the second component (B4) has been inserted into the groove (N) in the first component (S1), by peening the stamped studs (P2) in the interior of the groove (N) (Fig. 5a, 5b).

A method for producing an electromagnetically sealed 
securing of two metallic components (S1, S2, S3 with 

B1, B2, B3), in particular for securing a cover 
plate to a support bar of a shielded assembly 

support for electronic assemblies, wherein 

a) the first component (S1, S2 or S3) comprises a 
groove (N) at the edge of a surface (OS), which 

groove is covered by a leaf (L) preferably as a 
extension of the surface (OS) of the component (S1, 

S2 or S3), 
b) the second component (B1, B2 or B3) comprises a 
blade-like insertion area (EB), and 
c) after the insertion of the insertion area (EB) 
of the second component (B1, B2 or B3) into the 

groove (N), embossed nubs (P1) are formed in the 
surface (OS) of the first component (S1, S2 or S3) 

in the region of the leaf (L) (Figs. 1a to 4b). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein, in the case 
of the first component (S3) the leaf (L) comprises a 

longitudinal web (ST) on the inside of the groove 
(N), and the embossed nubs (P1) are formed in the 

surface (OB) of the first component (S3) in the 

region of the leaf (L) directly above the 
longitudinal web (ST). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
second component (B2) comprises countersunk points 

(SP) on the surface (OB) of the insertion area (EB), 
more particularly hollows, bores or punched holes, 

and the embossed nubs (P1) are formed in the surface 
(OS) of the first component (S1, S2, S3) in the  

 
region of the leaf (L) directly above the individual 

countersunk points (SP) in each case. (Figs. 3a, 3b) 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
second component (B3) comprises a longitudinally 

extending recessed slot (SL2) on the surface (OB) of 
the insertion area (EB), and the embossed nubs (P1) 

are formed in the surface (OB) of the first 
component (S1, S2, S3) in the region of the leaf (L) 

directly above the recessed slot (SL2). (Figs. 4a, 
4b) 
A method according to claim 1, wherein, in the case 
of the first component (S2) the base of the groove 

(N) lying opposite the groove inner side beneath the 
leaf (L) comprises a longitudinal slot (SL1), and 

the embossed nubs (P1) are formed in the surface 
(OS) of the first component (S2) in the region of 

the leaf (L) directly above the longitudinal slot 
(SL1). 
A method for producing an electromagnetically sealed 
securing of two metallic components (S1, B4), in 

particular for securing a cover plate to a support 
bar of a shielded assembly support for electronic 

assemblies, wherein 

a) the first component (S1) comprises a groove (N) 
on one surface (OS), 
b) the second component (B4) comprises a blade-like 
insertion area (EB), in which embossed nubs 

(P2) are formed so as to project, and 
c) the securing of the two components (S1, B4) is 
effected after the insertion of the insertion area 

(EB) of the second component (B4) into the groove  
 

(N) of the first component (S1) by wedging the 
embossed nubs (P2) within the groove (N). (Figs. 5a 

and 5b) 
A method according to claim 6, the groove (N) 
comprising a constriction or a smaller width at the 

edge of the surface (OS) of the first component (S1) 
than at the groove interior. 
A method according to claim 6 or 7, the groove (N) 
comprising at least one inlet slope (E) directly at 

the edge of the surface (OS) of the first component 
(S1). 
A shielded assembly support for securing electronic 
components, in particular circuit boards, with 


a) a first metallic component (S1, S2 or S3), in 
particular a support bar, which comprises a groove 

(N) at the edge of a surface (OS), which groove is 
covered by a leaf (L), preferably as an extension of 

the surface (OS) of the component (S1, S2 or S3),

effected by embossed nubs (P1), which after the 
insertion of the insertion area (EB) of the second 

component (B1, B2, or B3) into the groove (N), are
