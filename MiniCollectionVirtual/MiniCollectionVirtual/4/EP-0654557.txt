<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the bleaching of textile materials composed wholly or partially of cellulosic materials, especially in woven denim form, by treatment in an aqueous-alkaline medium at elevated temperature, in which the bleaching agent employed is a combination of formamidinesulfinic acid and carbohydrates having the general empirical formula CnH2nOn in a weight ratio of from 80:20 to 99:1.

<CLAIMS>
A method for bleaching denim articles or warp bodies 
consisting wholly or partially of cellulosic materials, 

comprised of indigo-dyed warp and mainly white shot, by 
treatment in an alkaline-aquous medium at increased temperature 

without colouring the mainly white shot, characterized in that 
a combination of formamidine sulfinic acid and carbohydrates of 

the general total formula C

 at a weight ratio of 80:20 to 
99:1 is used as the bleaching agent. 
A method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
monosaccharides which act in a reducing manner are used as the 

carbohydrate of the general total formula C

A method in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that 
glucose is employed as the monosaccharide which acts in a 

reducing manner. 
A method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
oligosaccharides are employed as the carbohydrate. 
A method in accordance with claim 4, characterized in that 
sucrose is employed as the carbohydrate. 
A method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
bleaching is performed at liquour ratios of 1:1 to 1:40. 
A method in accordance with claim 6, characterized in that 
bleaching is performed at a liquour ratio of 1:5 to 1:7.
