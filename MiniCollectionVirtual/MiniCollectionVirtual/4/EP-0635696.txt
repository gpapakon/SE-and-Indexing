<ABSTRACT>
The device is used for the electronic measurement of the thickness of thin webs or sheets, in particular foils, films, or paper sheets. It consists of a fixed supporting surface (2) and a tactile sensor (3) which is mounted in a sensor housing (5), which is arranged above the supporting surface (2), such that it can move perpendicular to this supporting surface (2) and which has as tactile member an essentially cylindrical target (7) having a feeler surface (25) which is on the end face and points towards the supporting surface (2). The target (7) forms the return element, which influences the signal of an inductive pickup (transducer) as a function of positioning, and it is displaceably guided in the sensor housing (5) axially with respect to the latter. In its end face opposite the feeler surface (25), the target (7) has a cutout (19) in the form of a paraboloid of revolution. Arranged as pickup in the sensor housing (5) is a sensor coil (6) for generating a magnetic field which projects coaxially into the cutout (19) in the target (7).

A device for electronically measuring the thickness of thin webs or sheets, 
particularly foils or sheets of paper, consisting of a fixed supporting surface and, disposed 

rigidly and substantially at right-angles to this support surface (2, 49), a scanning sensor 
comprising a ferromagnetic sensing member adapted for movement in relation to the 

supporting surface and which, as a function of its position in relation to the supporting 
surface, influences the signal from an inductive measured value transmitter which is 

constructed as a sensor coil, characterised in that the scanning sensor (3, 3/1) comprises 
a sensor housing (5, 5/1) disposed above the supporting surface (2, 49) and, as a sensing 

element, a substantially cylindrical target (7, 7/1, 7/2) having a sensing surface (25, 25/1) 
directed at the supporting surface and in that the target (7, 7/1, 7/2) is guided for 

displacement in and axially in relation to the sensor housing (5, 5/1) and in that the target 
(7, 7/1, 7/2) comprises in its end face remote from the sensing surface (25, 25/1) a recess 

(19, 19/1) in the form of a parabola of rotation and in that in the sensor housing (5, 5/1), 
the sensor coil (6, 6/1) penetrates at least partially into the recess (19, 19/1) of the target 

(7, 7/1, 7/2) and in that the target (7, 7/1, 7/2) and the sensor coil (6, 6/1) are disposed 
coaxially of each other. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the recess (19, 19/1) in the 
target (7, 7/1, 7/2) is in the form of an elliptical parabola. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the target (7, 7/1, 7/2) has 
at its end and towards the supporting surface (2) a rotatably mounted scanning roller (35) 

of which the substantially cylindrical outer surface (34) constitutes the sensing surface of 
the tartget (7, 7/1, 7/2). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the supporting surface is 
constituted by a rotatable rigidly disposed supporting cylinder (53) on the outer surface 

of which rolls the sensing roller (35) of the target (7, 7/1, 7/2).  
 
A device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the sensor housing (3/1) 
has its longitudinal central axis (4/1) disposed radially in relation to the supporting 

cylinder (53). 
A device according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the supporting cylinder 
(53) is a constituent part of a drive roller (48) of one or more conveyor belts (49, 50). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the sensor coil (6, 
6/1) is a shell core coil with a directional magnetic field.
