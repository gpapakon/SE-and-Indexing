<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a paper coating pigment, in particular an
improved kaolinitic clay pigment for use in a coating composition for
preparing coated papers which are especially suitable
for printing by the offset or rotogravure processes.
Herein, the term "paper" is used to describe any
fibrous web having a surface which receives a coating
composition, and includes materials such as board.Coated papers for use in printing may be prepared
by a number of different coating processes. However,
when the coated paper is required to be prepared by
coating a web of paper at high speed the coating
apparatus generally includes a blade in the trailing
orientation relative to the web, in other words such
that it makes an acute angle with the web on the
upstream side of the blade. The purpose of this blade
is to act as a "doctor" which removes surplus coating
composition leaving a smooth and level coating of the
required coat weight over the whole width of the web.Two especially commonly used types of paper
coating apparatus are the roll applicator coater and
the short-dwell coater. In the roll applicator coater
the web of uncoated paper passes through the nip
between two rolls, one of which is partially immersed
in a bath of the coating composition, and thus
transfers coating composition on to one side of the
web. The web then passes, coated side outwards, around
a backing roll, which is preferably covered with a
sleeve of resilient material, and a trailing blade is
biased against the web supported by the backing roll,
at a pressure such as to give the desired coat weight.
The trailing blade is generally mounted at a distance
of from about 200mm to about 1000mm downstream of the
roll applicator. Now, increasing use is being made of
coating apparatus of the short-dwell type. In this
type of apparatus the coating composition is fed under 
a small positive pressure to a chamber which is a few
centimetres in width, one wall of which is formed by a
blade in a trailing orientation with respect to the
web, and another wall of which is formed by the web.
With this type of apparatus a very much shorter time
elapses between the application of the coating
composition to the paper and the removal of excess
coating by the trailing blade.There is a trend in the paper coating industry to
run coating machines at increasingly faster speeds.
When the first trailing blade coater was introduced in
1955, the maximum speed of the web was about 600m.min-1.
Today commercial coating machines can run at a web
speed of 1500m.min-1 and
