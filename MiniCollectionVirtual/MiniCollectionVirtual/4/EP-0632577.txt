<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for performing digital signal frequency 
translation in a digital receiver is disclosed. The 

apparatus uses a plurality of mixer-filter-decimator 
stages (102) for performing the digital signal frequency 

translation. The translation function converts the digital 
signal to an intermediate frequency (IF), where such 

translation is distributed among the plurality of mixer-filter-decimator 
stages to thereby simplify the mixing 

requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to IF
conversion, and more specifically to a multi-stage digital
RF translator for performing IF conversion.Modern communications receivers range from simple FM-stereo
radios to more complex, high-bandwidth communications
receivers such as those used for satellite communications.
These receivers can be implemented using entirely analog
technology, or portions of the receiver can be implemented
using digital solutions.The typical analog FM receiver, for example, mixes an
incoming FM signal with a variable injection frequency so
that the desired channel is positioned at a desired IF
(intermediate frequency). This mixing is often termed a
frequency conversion or a frequency translation. In more
advanced solutions, multiple frequency conversions may be
performed to detect the desired frequency. In these
advanced receivers, the first conversion is typically
performed using a variable injection frequency, while the
subsequent conversions use a fixed injection frequency.With the advent of digital technology, there has been a
trend in communications technology to implement a variety of
receiver functions using digital circuits. Rapid advances
in solid-state and digital-signal-processing technologies
have furthered efforts to digitize communications receivers.One conventional solution implementing digital circuits
digitizes the received signal and performs a quadrature mix
of the digitized signal to convert it directly to nominally
0 Hz IF. This mixing technique uses digital multipliers
that are fed by high speed oscillators to provide sine and
cosine injection signals. The mixing is followed by one or
more stages of filtering and decimation to isolate the
desired receive channel. One or more of the filtering
stages may be implemented using simple multiplierless
filters for ease of implementation in high speed
applications. An example of such a prior art technique is
shown in UK patent application, GB-A-2,114,840 (Potter, R.W.). A problem with this conventional solution is that the
sine and cosine signals injected at the mixer must be
generated at very high frequencies (e.g., 88 to 108 MHz for
a broadcast FM receiver) to obtain proper conversion
results. Generating these signals can be costly and
requires a large amount of integrated circuit area.What is needed is a digital receiver solution that
allows digitization and channel isolation in the digital
signal processing (DSP) domain of high-frequency receive
signals without requiring high-speed DSP oscillators for
mixer
