<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a tread (12) provided 
with two circumferential grooves (4), said two 

circumferential grooves (4) axially dividing the 
tread (12) into three annular parts (3A,3B and 3C), 

each defining part of a ground contacting region of 
the tread, each of the three annular parts (3A,3B 

and 3C) being provided with a plurality of axial 
grooves (5A,5B and 5C) arranged circumferentially of 

the tyre at a pitch length (PA,PB and PC) 
respectively, the pitch length (PA,PB or PC) being 

constant in each annular part (3A,3B,3C), but 
different from those of the remaining two annular 

parts, characterised in that the tread (12) is 
provided with three different pitch lengths (PA,PB 

and PC), the ratio of the reciprocals of the three 
pitch lengths (PA,PB,PC) is equal to the ratio of 

the three frequencies of the three tones of a 
consonance, said consonance being one selected from 

the group consisting of major triads and minor 
triads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre, 
more particularly to an improvement in a tread 
pattern which is capable of simultaneously 
generating three different tones sounding as a 
consonance. In general, a tyre is provided in the tread portion 
with a plurality of axial grooves to improve 
drainage, road grip and the like. Such axial 
grooves, however, inevitably generate a noise sound 
during running. Hitherto, therefore, in order to reduce such a 
running noise, many attempts have been made, which 
are roughly classified into two methods: one is to 
reduce the amplitude of the noise sound pressure; 
and the other is to flatten the peaked frequency 
spectrum of the sound. For example, Japanese patent application laid-open 
No. JP-A-59-140104 teaches a method classified as 
the latter method, wherein the number of tread 
design cycles in one tread half is differed from 
that in the other tread half so as to have mutually  
 
a difference in the range of from 5 to 50 %, 
preferably from 10 to 30%. In such a method, however, it was found that a harsh 
sound disagreeable to the ear often occurred even 
when the design cycle number difference was set in 
the preferable range, and it was difficult to 
flatten the frequency spectrum. EP-A-0324605 discloses a tyre having a basic rib and 
at least one chord rib, each rib comprising a 
plurality of basic pitch elements having the same 
pitch length wherein the pattern of sound from the 
basic rib and the chord rib have a consonance 
relation. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre, wherein the running 
noise or disagreeable sound during running is 
reduced, and in which drifting to one side of the vehicle is prevented. According to the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprises a tread being axially 
divided by two circumferential grooves into three 
annular parts, a first annular part, a second 
annular part and a third annular part, each defining  
 
part of a ground contacting region of the tread, the 
first annular part being centred on the tyre 
equator, the second annular part being positioned on 
one side of the first annular part, the third 
annular part being positioned on the other side of 
the first annular part, each of the three annular 
parts being provided with a plurality of axial 
grooves arranged circumferentially of the tyre at a 
pitch length, the pitch length being constant in 
each annular part, but different from those of the 
remaining two annular parts so that the tread is
