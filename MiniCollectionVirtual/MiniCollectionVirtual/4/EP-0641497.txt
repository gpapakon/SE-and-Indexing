<ABSTRACT>
Past methods and apparatus for manufacturing a rotor assembly have been used to provide rotor assemblies for rotating electric machines. Many of these electric machines rotate at low speeds. The present method and apparatus for manufacturing a rotor assembly can be used to make a rotor assembly (16) to be used at high speeds. The rotor aassembly (16) includes a shaft (24) having a frustoconical mounting surface (26) defined thereon and having a plurality of magnets (70) attached to the frustoconical mounting surface (26). A cover (80) having a frustoconical inner surface (82) surrounds the magnets (70) and compressively secures the magnets (70) to the shaft (24). The compressive forces applied by the cover (80) and the adhesive used to secure the magnets (70) insuring that a positive contact pressure exists between the magnets (70) and the shaft (24) during operation of the electric machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
electric machine and more particularly to 
a rotor assembly having magnets 
attached thereto and to a method of making this rotor assembly. Permanent magnet rotors are frequently used 
in electric machines such as motors and generators. 
In many applications, permanent magnets are secured to 
a rotor hub or shaft by any of a variety of means. 
Care must be taken to assure that such securement 
prevents the magnets from moving either axially or 
radially. If axial movement is permitted, one or more 
magnets may not properly align with an armature with 
the consequence being that the generator efficiency 
diminishes. If radial movement occurs, the 
probability of interfering contact between the rotor 
and the stator exists, and the resulting frictional 
drag and/or damage to generator parts comes into 
existence. As may be expected, securement of magnets 
increasingly becomes a problem with increased rotor 
speeds due to the increasing forces tending to cause 
magnet movement, particularly in the radial direction, 
with the increasing centrifugal force accompanying 
increasing rotational speeds. Thus, in many 
instances where there are relatively high speeds, and 
permanent magnet rotors are required, securement of 
the magnets against both axial and radial displacement 
is accomplished by sandwiching the magnets between  
 
side plates which prevent axial displacement and by 
winding a fibrous material such as carbon fiber about 
the peripheries of the side plates and the magnets to 
provide radial retention. An example of this approach 
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,674,178 issued June 
23, 1987 to Navinchandra R. Patel. Patel's patent 
discloses a rotor assembly having the permanent 
magnets attached thereto by a fibrous winding which is 
devoid of loose or potentially loose fibers and ends 
of the windings. The permanent magnets are disposed 
in a hub and filler material is located between 
adjacent ones of the magnets. Axially spaced, 
opposite side plates are located on the hub to 
sandwich the magnets and the filler material. Another method and apparatus for assembling 
a rotor is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,918,802 
issued April 24, 1990 to Edward J. Schaefer. 
Schaefer's patent discloses a rotor assembly having a 
plurality of permanent magnet segments and an outer 
sleeve or cylinder. A thin-walled metal cylinder is 
fashioned and arcuate magnet segments are positioned 
in angularly spaced relation against the interior 
surface of the cylinder. The
