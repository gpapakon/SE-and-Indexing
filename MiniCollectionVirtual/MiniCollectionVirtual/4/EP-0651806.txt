<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to feline immunodeficiency
virus (FIV) and to the development of
vaccines for use in protecting cats and kittens against
FIV infection.FIV is a recently discovered T-lymphotropic lentivirus
which infects cats to produce an AIDS-like syndrome.
FIV, while exhibiting morphological and pathological
similarity, has however been shown to be antigenically
distinct from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
(Pederson et al., Science 235: 790-793, 1987). Infected
cats and kittens show a generally debilitating AIDS-like
disease with intermittent symptoms (eg. lymphadenopathy,
leucopenia, anaemia and secondary opportunistic
infection) leading ultimately to death.Epidemiological studies have shown FIV infection to be
widespread worldwide and the disease is rapidly
acquiring significant clinical importance from a
veterinary point of view. Efforts have accordingly
recently begun to be directed to the development of
vaccines against FIV but whilst preliminary results with
vaccines based on fixed infected whole cells or whole
inactivated virus look promising (Yamamoto et al., AIDS
research and human retroviruses, 7(11): 911-922, 1991),
there are as yet no reports in the literature of
successful immunisation of cats against FIV infection
using sub-unit or peptide-based vaccines. No commercial
vaccines are currently available.Despite its ubiquitous presence, FIV does not appear to
be capable of cat to human transmission. Nonetheless,
FIV shares with HIV and other mammalian lentiviruses 
similarities in genome organisation, biological
properties, the propensity for persistent infection in
the natural host, with its concomitant pathological
manifestations (eg. decline in CD4+ lymphocytes, both in
vivo and in vitro, gradual loss of immune function, and
opportunistic infection). Thus the development of
experimental models of non-human lentivirus infections,
such as FIV, may facilitate the design of vaccine and
therapeutic strategies for HIV infection of humans.The molecular structure of FIV, in terms of genome
organisation and nucleotide sequence, has been studied
(Talbot et al., PNAS, 86: 5743-5747, 1989; Olmstead et
al., PNAS 86: 8088-8092, 1989) but as yet there are few
reports of the identification of antigenically important
regions and no reports of specific regions which may
contain epitopes useful for the development of
neutralising vaccines or drug therapies.Replication competent molecular clones of FIV have
recently become available (Siebelink et al., J. Virol.
66(3): 1091-1097, 1992).
