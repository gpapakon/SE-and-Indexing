<ABSTRACT>
The present invention decides whether frames into 
which compressed moving picture signals are 

sequentially inputted are intra-frame-coded (intra-frames) 
or coded by the relation with a reference 

frame (prediction frames) by the intra-picture data 
detector, and when a recording start command is 

issued, starts to write the compressed moving picture 
signals into the buffer memory at the timing that the 

first intra-frame thereafter is detected, runs a 
magnetic tape so that the record starting point 

detector detects the record starting point on the 
magnetic tape, and when the record starting point is 

detected, reads the compressed moving picture signals 
from the buffer memory, supplies them to the head, and 

records them on the magnetic tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compressed 
moving picture recording method and apparatus 
therefor for recording moving picture signals which 
are inter-frame-coded with prediction on a recording 
medium and particularly to assembling of sequences 
thereof. The picture coding art for compressing moving 
pictures is explained, for example, in the journal of 
the institute of television engineers of Japan; Vol. 
45, No. 7 (1991), pp 800 to 819. Particularly a high 
compression ratio is obtained for inter-frame-coding 
with prediction, so that the art is applied to 
digital television (TV) broadcasting on a priority 
basis. By using the mutual relation between frames, the 
prior art obtains a moving vector against a reference 
frame, takes the pixel value at the position which is 
offset in correspondence with the movement between 
the frames as a prediction value, and codes the  
 
difference from this prediction value and the moving 
vector. As a reference frame, the preceding or 
subsequent frame or both of them may be used. A 
frame which is coded like this will be called a 
prediction frame hereinafter. A frame (hereinafter 
called an intra-frame) which is intra-frame-coded at 
a certain interval of frames is inserted. For 
decoding, the prediction value of each frame is 
obtained using the difference of prediction value 
whenever an intra-frame starts and each frame is 
regenerated by using it. When a digital TV signal (compressed moving 
picture signal) which is inter-frame-coded with 
prediction and data-compressed as mentioned above is 
applied to a magnetic recording/regenerating 
apparatus using a magnetic tape as a recording 
medium, it is predicted that the signal will be 
recorded or regenerated efficiently because the data 
compression ratio is high. However, this inter-frame-coding 
with prediction does not take recording 
and regenerating of data into full consideration. 
Therefore, when it is applied to a magnetic 
recording/regenerating apparatus, the following 
problems will be caused. Namely, a conventional magnetic  
 
recording/regenerating apparatus is designed so as to 
record a new TV signal on a recording medium where TV 
signals are partially recorded already, that is, to 
perform so-called assembling of sequences. In the 
case of this assembling of sequences, the end edge of 
the recording region of TV signals (recorded TV 
signals) which are recorded already on the recording 
medium is used as a start position of the recording 
region of a TV signal (new TV signal) which
