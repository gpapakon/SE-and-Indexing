<DESCRIPTION>
 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONThis invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition, to processes for the preparation of such a composition and to the use of such a composition in medicine.European Patent Application, Publication Number 0376524 discloses certain benzopyran derivatives which are stated inter alia to be potentially useful as bronchodilators in the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, such as reversible airways obstruction and asthma, and also in the treatment of hypertension.EP 0376524 also discloses trans (3S, 4R)-3,4-dihydro-2,2- dimethyl-4-(2-oxopiperidin-l-yl)-6-pentafluoroethyl-2H-l- benzopyran-3-ol ('Compound D.It has now been discovered that a discrete and particular pharmaceutical composition comprising Compound I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, is particularly useful for the treatment in humans of disorders of the respiratory tract, such as reversible airways obstruction and asthma: the hypotensive activity of such composition is largely reduced.Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising Compound I or, a pharmaceutically. acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefore, characterised in that the composition comprises 0.2 to 0.9 mg or 1.1 to 1.9 mg or 2.1 to 3.0 mg of Compound I.Particular compositions comprise 0.3 to 0.8 mg, 0.4 to 0.7 mg, 0.2 to 0.5 mg, 0.5 to 0.9 mg, 1.1 to 1.5 mg, 1.5 to 1.9 mg, 2.1 to 2.5 mg or 2.5 to 3.0 mg of active compound.Examples of compositions are those comprising 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 , 0.9, 1.1, 1.5, 1.9, 2.1, 2.5 or 3.0 mg of active compound.Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those described in 

 EP0376524. Generally, Compound I is not in a salted form.Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include those described in EP0376524, in particular hydrates.Compound I or, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, may be prepared using known methods, for example those disclosed in EP0376524. The disclosures of EP0376524 are incorporated herein by reference.In one aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising 0.2 to 0.9 mg or 1.1 to 1.9 mg or 2.1 to 3.0 mg of Compound I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, and optionally a pharmaceutically
