<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transparent security documents that can be verified on their authenticity
and are protected against counterfeiting by photo-copying.Security documents that must be verifiable on their authenticity are e.g. all kinds of identification documents such
as passports, visas, identity cards, driver licenses, bank cards, credit cards, security entrance cards, and further value-documents
such as banknotes, shares, bonds, certificates, cheques, lottery tickets and all kinds of entrance tickets
such as airplane tickets and railroad season-tickets.Nowadays, by the availability of markedly improved black-and-white and color copiers it becomes more and more
easy to copy documents at high quality hardly to distinguish from the originals.To protect the above mentioned documents against fraudulent alterations and reproduction by photo-copying different
techniques are used such as the melt-laminating or glueing thereto of preprinted plastic overlayers; the printing
with special inks; the application of coatings or layers for example loaded with magnetic or fluorescent pigments; coloring
or metallizing the substrate of the documents; incorporating holograms; applying fine line printing, watermarks, fibers,
security threads, light diffraction marks, liquid crystal marks and/or substances called nacreous, iridiscent or
interference pigments.In a particular case disclosed in US-P 4,151,666 light-transmissive pigments serving as diffuse reflectors are
applied by printing to form a verification pattern in a laminated identification card (I.D. card). In the specification of the
same US-P the use of nacreous pigments in verification patterns has been described. Nacreous pigments, also called
pearlescent pigments have light-reflection characteristics that change as a function of the viewing or copying angle. The
effect of changing color with viewing angle makes that nacreous pigments represent a simple and convenient matter to
built in a verification feature associated with a non-copyable optical property.Interference pigments are in the form of light-reflecting crystal platelets of appropriate thickness to produce color
by interference. These pigments exhibit a color play that verges on iridiscence and under a given angle of reflection will
allow only the copying of a single color, whereas other colors appear under different angles of reflection, in other words
these pigments show another color to the human eye depending on the observation angle. High nacreous luster is
accompanied by high
