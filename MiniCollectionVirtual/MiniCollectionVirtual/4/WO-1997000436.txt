<ABSTRACT>
In this embodiment the size distribution of particles in a fluid is determined by performing the following steps: (a) passing a plurality of ultrasonic beams through the fluid, wherein the beams have respective frequencies (f1, f2,...fn); (b) obtaining a velocity measure of the beams in the fluid; (c) obtaining an ultrasonic velocity spectrum as a function of particle size for the fluid; (d) determining from the attenuation of gamma-rays the density of the fluid; and (e) calculating the particle size distribution for the fluid from the velocity measure, the velocity spectrum, and the suspension density which were respectively obtained in steps (b), (c) and (d).

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: DETERMINING THITSIZE DISTRIBUTION OF PARTICLES IN A FLUIDThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus fordetermining the size distribution of particles in a fluid.The term fluid is intended to include both a liquid and the solid particlescontained in that liquid. Examples include slurries and other suspensions.The invention has been developed primarily for use with opaque slurries in themineral and paint industries and will be described hereinafter with reference to that application. However, the invention is not limited to these particular fields of use andcan also be used to determine size distribution of particles in other suspensions and inother industries such as the chemical, pigment, pharmaceutical, food and cosmeticindustries, amongst others. The invention is particularly applicable to on-line particlesize analysis for the control of grinding, crystallisation, precipitation andagglomeration processes. 

 It is preferable to use on-line particle size analysers to negate the need for side stream or dilution ofthe fluid being analysed. Hitherto, such analysers have made useof either the attenuation experienced by one or more ultrasonic beams directed throughthe fluid, laser scanning or laser diffraction.It is an object ofthe present invention, at least in the preferred embodiment, toprovide a method and apparatus for determining the size distribution of particles in afluid using a velocity measure of a plurality of ultrasonic beams at differentfrequencies in said fluid.According to one aspect ofthe invention there is provided a method fordetermining the size distribution of particles in a fluid, the method including the stepsof:(a) passing a plurality of ultrasonic beams through the fluid, wherein thebeams have respective frequencies fj, f2,....fâ€ž;(b) obtaining a velocity measure ofthe beams in the fluid;(c) obtaining an ultrasonic velocity spectrum as a function of particle sizefor the fluid; and(d) calculating the particle size distribution for the particles in the fluidfrom the velocity measure and the velocity spectrum which were respectively obtainedin steps (b) and (c).Preferably, the ultrasonic velocity spectrum is obtained either by priorexperiment or calculation.Preferably, step (c) includes transforming the velocity spectrum into a linearform. More preferably, step (d) includes an inversion ofthe linear form. 

 Preferably also, the method includes the steps of:(e) passing gamma rays through the fluid;(f) determining from the attenuation ofthe gamma-rays the density
