<ABSTRACT>
A goods accommodation method and apparatus in which a container (17) 
is set such tha
t its opening is directed horizontally, and box-shaped 
goods (1) are 

stacked on a slide (59) such that their surfaces facing the opening of 
the container are 

aligned with each other. The goods are transferred into the container 
while they 

are held in the stacked state by inserting the slide together with the 
goods stacked 

thereon into the container and then quickly pulling the slide out of 
the container at 

a speed higher than the speed of insertion such that the stacked goods 
remain in the 

container. The container is then turned up such that its opening is 
directed upward.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method and an apparatus
for accommodating goods in a container, and in particular, for accommodating
box-shaped goods in containers at goods distribution centers or the like.The document US-A-3 857 501 describes an apparatus for loading containers with cargo
disposed on pallets. The apparatus comprises a base mounting a track for a conveying
carriage and a support for mounting the container. Carrier elements are provided on the
support for locking the container that is to be loaded in position. The carriage has top
and bottom rollers for supporting pallets disposed on the top rollers and is movable by
means of a chain belt drived by a motor so as to be advanced in and retracted from the
container.The document US-A-3 434 603 describes a loading machine comprising a platform for
supporting boxes cantilevered at the end of horizontal extensible arm means. The
platform is advanced into a container. A piston assembly is provided for pushing the
boxes from the platformIn the prior art, a goods accommodation method as shown in Fig.
20A is used, in which box-shaped goods 2 are accommodated in a container 1.
In this method, the container 1 is set such that its opening is directed horizontally,
and goods 2 are stacked on a stacking table 3 such that the container sides facing
the opening of the container are aligned with each other. Then, the goods 2 are
pushed with a pusher plate 4 into the container 1, and the container 1 is turned up
such that its opening is directed upward.In the prior art, however, when the goods 2 are pushed by the pusher
plate 4 into the container 1, they are stopped at a position near the opening of the
container 1. Therefore, when the container 1 is turned up, the goods 2 in the upper
stage may fall as illustrated in Fig. 20A and may be crushed, or the state of the
stack may be deformed. The object of the present invention is to accommodate stacked goods
in a container without deformation of the form of the stack.According to a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided
a goods accommodation method of accommodating box-shaped goods stacked in
a plurality of stages one over another in a container while maintaining the state of 
the stack, by disposing the container such that the opening thereof is directed
horizontally, stacking the box-shaped goods on a slide with the container side
surfaces of the goods aligned, then transferring the goods in the stacked state into
the container by inserting the slide together with the goods stacked
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A goods accommodation method, comprising the steps of:

disposing a container such that an opening thereof is directed
horizontally;
stacking box-shaped goods on a slide with side surfaces of said
box-shaped goods facing container being aligned with each other;
transferring the stacked goods into the container by inserting the
slide together with the goods stacked thereon into the container and pulling the

slide out of the container at a speed higher than the speed of insertion such that the
stacked goods remain in the container; and
turning the container such that the opening thereof is directed
upwardly.
A goods accommodation apparatus comprising:

a container position changing unit for changing a position of a
container between a position at which an opening of the container is directed

horizontally and a position at which the opening of the container is directed
upwardly;
a slide for supporting box-shaped goods placed thereon in a stacked
state; and
a slide drive unit for advancing the slide into and retreating the slide
out of the container through the opening thereof directed horizontally, a speed of

movement of the slide out of the container being set to be higher than a speed of
movement of the slide into the container.
The goods accommodation apparatus according to claim 2,
wherein the slide is inclined downwardly toward the inside of the container.
The goods accommodation apparatus according to claim 2, further
comprising: 


a goods return prevention member for blocking the opening of the
container when the slide is moved out of the container.
A goods accommodation method
according to claim 1

comprising the steps of:

collecting goods received on
at least one

goods receptacle by causing the goods
to gather on a goods reception surface of the goods receptacles such that the goods

are adjacent to a movable side wall of the goods reception surface using:
goods receptacle having a goods reception surface
inclined downwardly from a goods reception side, the goods receptacle including

a movable side wall for opening and closing a side zone on a downward side of the

goods reception surface;
a shutter disposed along a side of the goods receptacle and including
a shutter member capable of position change between a tilted position, at which

goods delivered from the goods receptacle are received, and a horizontal position,
at which goods are delivered, the shutter member being opened at the horizontal 

position thereof to permit delivery of goods; and
a table unit disposed beneath the shutter and including a stacking
table with the slide thereon, the stacking table being for supporting goods delivered

from the shutter and also being capable of being raised and lowered to stack goods
delivered from the shutter on goods delivered earlier on the slide on the stacking

table;
transferring the goods by opening the movable side wall of the goods
receptacle to cause sliding of the goods on the goods reception surface so as to

effect transfer of goods onto the shutter member, the shutter member having
substantially a same slope of inclination as a slope of inclination of the goods

reception surface; and
stacking the goods on the slide in a state with the
container side surfaces of the goods aligned on the slide by bringing the shutter

member of the shutter to be horizontal and then opening the shutter member;
the collecting, transferring and stacking steps being carried out
repeatedly to collect goods in a vertical stack of a plurality of stages on the slide

on the stacking table.
A goods accommodation apparatus (10) according to claim 2 or 3 comprising:

at least one goods receptacle (34) having a goods reception surface (35) 
inclined downwardly from a goods reception side toward another side, the goods

receptacle including a movable side wall (36) for blocking a side of the goods reception
surface;
a shutter (13) disposed along a side of the at least one goods receptacle
and including a shutter member (44) for changing position between a tilted position at

which goods delivered from the at least one goods receptacle are received, and a
horizontal position, at which goods are delivered, the shutter member being opened

at the horizontal position thereof to permit delivery of goods; and
a table unit (14) disposed beneath the shutter and including a stacking
table (52) with the slide (59) thereon, the stacking table being for supporting goods delivered

from the shutter and for being raised and lowered to stack goods delivered from the
shutter on goods delivered on the slide on the stacking table.
