<ABSTRACT>
A new telephone service is described that places calls between people 
who mutually want to communicate with each other. The telephone or other network 

matches lists of users desiring to receive calls from other users with similar lists. 
Affinity lists can be based on family, friends, tennis partners, members of discussion 

groups or co-workers. Speech recognition and keying techniques are used to prepare 
lists for storage in a database. Database comparisons are used to direct the 

completion of calls between users in affinity groups who have indicated their 
availability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to telecommunications systems, and more 
particularly to telephone systems for automatically establishing communication 
between subscribers based on mutually agreed upon connection criteria. One limitation imposed by most uses of the current telephone system is 
that a potential user is required to explicitly originate each phone call. With this 
restriction relaxed by mutual agreement between two or more parties, the telephone 
system can provide a convenient complement for the way people think and act in 
other circumstances. When so modified, the telephone system can introduce some of 
the flavor of casual face-to-face encounters, those in which no explicit introduction is 
required prior to talking. While prior art systems and techniques have included event-responsive 
calling, these systems and techniques have typically been responsive to alarm 
conditions or the like or have involved recorded announcements, rather than mutual 
availability for and interest in participation in a call. In a basic embodiment of the present invention, telephones are fitted 
with a button or key, conveniently styled a "call me" key. Of course equivalent 
means to a call me key can be substituted in appropriate cases. Thus, for example. 
users conveniently dial a predetermined number and, if more than one variety of 
service is available, enter a code corresponding to the desired service. The system is 
thus able to recognize the calling station number and, as appropriate, the interest and 
availability at that station. Regardless of the particular means for signaling 
availability or interest to the system it sometimes proves convenient in the following 
discussion to refer to such signaling as depressing the call me key. When the user depresses the call me key, the telephone network, as 
modified in a manner hereinafter described, searches for people who are mutually 
interested in talking to each other as indicated by having their "call me" buttons 
pressed. If there is more than one such person, the network selects randomly, or in 
accordance with some rule or algorithm. For example, the network can select 
persons who have not spoken with each other for some predetermined time, or for 
the longest time. The network then calls both people, advantageously making a brief  
 
introductory announcement, and completes the connections. One straightforward example of the use of such a service is based on a 
list of friends and family members. Each subscriber to the service advantageously

<CLAIMS>
A method for establishing communications among a plurality of users 
comprising 

   means for recognizing a ready signal indicative of the availability of at 
least some of said users, 

   means for establishing a communication path between at least some of 

said users in response to said ready signal. 
The system of claim 1 wherein said means for recognizing comprises 
means for receiving an indication of the readiness of each of said users. 
The system of claim 2 wherein said means for recognizing comprises 
   means for storing a prearranged time schedule for availability for said 

users, and 
   means for indicating current time, and 

   means responsive to a match between the times of availability of at least 
some of said users and said current time. 
The system of claim 2 wherein said means for recognizing comprises 
   means for recognizing a spoken indication of readiness by one or more 

of said users. 
The system of claim 4, wherein said means for recognizing a spoken 
indication of readiness comprises means for providing a request to speak a particular 

utterance. 
The system of claim I wherein said ready signal relative to a particular 
user indicates readiness to take part in a communication of a particular kind.
