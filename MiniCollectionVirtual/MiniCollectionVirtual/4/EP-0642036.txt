<ABSTRACT>
In an ultrasonic diagnostic equipment for
performing synthetic aperture, deterioration of picture

quality produced by the movement of an object is
prevented, thereby to provide an excellent image. Arrayed

piezoelectric transducers (1) are driven by a transmitting
circuit (2) so as to transmit ultrasonic waves into a

body, and, among echoes received by piezoelectric
transducers (T1 ∼ T8), first the signals of the

piezoelectric transducers (T3 ∼ T6) are selected by (SW3 ∼
SW6), amplified appropriately by amplifiers (7 ∼ 10) and

converted into digital signals by (A/D11 ∼ A/D14), added
with delay by a beam former (15) thereafter, and stored in

a memory (16). Similarly, the ultrasonic waves are
transmitted again, signals of the piezoelectric

transducers (T1, T2, T7, T8) are selected by the (SW3 ∼
SW6), applied with similar signal processing in the

amplifiers (7 ∼ 10), (A/D11 ∼ A/D14) and the beam former
15, and added to signals added with delay of the

piezoelectric transducers (T3 ∼ T6) stored in a memory 16
by an adder (17). The added signals are displayed on a

display unit (20) after applying signal processing such as
detection in a signal processing portion (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
diagnostic equipment having a synthetic aperture
receiving portion or a fold over portion of received
signals.An ultrasonic imaging apparatus for performing
synthetic aperture scanning is known recently. This
ultrasonic imaging apparatus has been introduced in P.D.
Corl, et al. "A digital synthetic focus acoustic imaging
system for NDE", Proc IEEE Ultrasonics Symp., Sept. 1978,
and the principle of the operation thereof will be
described with reference to a schematic block diagram
shown in Fig. 8.In Fig. 8, a reference numeral 1 represents an
ultrasonic probe, which is composed of piezoelectric
transducers T1 to T8. 100 represents a multiplexer
(hereinafter referred to as a MUX), 101 a transmitting
circuit, 102 an amplifier, 103 an A/D converter
(hereinafter referred to as an A/D), 104 a memory, 105 an
adder, 106 a signal processor and 107 a display unit. In
Fig. 8, the MUX 100 selects one of the piezoelectric
transducers T1 to T8, i.e., Tn. Next, the transmitting
circuit 101 generates driving pulses, thereby to drive the
selected piezoelectric transducer Tn. The piezoelectric transducer Tn generates
ultrasonic pulses, and the ultrasonic pulses reflected in
an object are received by the piezoelectric transducer Tn
as an echo ultrasonic wave. The received signals received
by the piezoelectric transducer Tn are converted into
digital data in the A/D 103 and written in the memory 104
after passing through the MUX 100 and being amplified by
the amplifier 102. When the write of the received signals
into the memory 104 from the piezoelectric transducer Tn
is completed, then the MUX 100 selects a piezoelectric
transducer Tn' different from the piezoelectric
transducer Tn, and writes the received signals into the
memory 104 in a similar manner as the case of the
piezoelectric transducer Tn. In a manner as described
above, the received signals obtained by the piezoelectric
transducers T1 to T8 are written into the memory 104.
Next, in the adder 105, respective received signals
obtained from the piezoelectric transducers T1 to T8 that
are stored in the memory 104 are added while providing
them with a predetermined time difference.When it is assumed that the object is at a
standstill during the period of reception by the
piezoelectric transducers T1 to T8, it is possible to give
receiving directivity such as beam forming and beam
steering in the object to the ultrasonic probe 1. The
received signals added by the adder 105 as described above
are applied with signal
