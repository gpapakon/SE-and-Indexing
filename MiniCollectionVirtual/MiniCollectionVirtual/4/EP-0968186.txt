<ABSTRACT>
The invention encompasses improved polyamides for binding to specific nucleotide sequences in the minor groove of double stranded DNA. The 3-hydroxy-N-methylpyrrole/N-methylpyrrole carboxamide pair specifically recognizes the T.A base pair, while the N-methylpyrrole/3-hydroxy-N-methylpyrrole pair recognizes A.T nucleotide pairs. Similarly, an N-methylimidizole/N-methylpyrrole carboxamide pair specifically recognizes the G.C nucleotide pair, and the N-methylpyrrole/N-methylimidizole carboxamide pair recognizes the C.G nucleotide pair.

 IMPROVED POLY AMIDES FOR BINDING IN THE MINOR GROOVE OF DOUBLE STRANDED DNAThe U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Grant Nos. GM26453, 27681 and 47530 awarded by the National Institute of Health.CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of PCT US97/03332 filed February 20, 1997,Serial No. 08/853,522 filed May 8, 1997 and PCT/US 97/12722 filed July 21, 1997 which are continuation-in-part applications of Serial No. 08/837,524, filed April 21, 1997, Serial No.08/607,078, filed February 26, 1996, provisional application Serial No. 60/042,022, filed April16, 1997 and provisional application Serial No. 60/043,444, filed April 8, 1997.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to polyamides which bind to predetermined sequences in the minor groove of double stranded DNA.Description of the Related ArtThe design of synthetic ligands that read the information stored in the DNA double helix has been a long standing goal of chemistry. Cell-permeable small molecules which target predetermined DNA sequences are useful for the regulation of gene-expression. Oligodeoxynucleotides that recognize the major groove of double-helical DNA via triple-helix formation bind to a broad range of sequences with high affinity and specificity. Although oligonucleotides and their analogs have been shown to interfere with gene expression, the triple helix approach is limited to purine tracks and suffers from poor cellular uptake. The development of pairing rules for minor groove binding polyamides derived from N- methylpyrrole (Py) and N-methylimidazole (Im) amino acids provides another code to control sequence specificity. An Im/Py pair distinguishes G*C from C«G and both of these from A«T or T«A base pairs. Wade, W.S., Mrksich, M. & Dervan, P.B. describes the design of peptides that bind in the minor groove of DNA at 5'-(A,T)G(A,T)C(A,T)-3' sequences by a dimeric side-by-side motif. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114, 8783-8794 (1992); Mrksich, M. et al. describes antiparallel side-by-side motif for sequence specific-recognition in the minor groove of DNA by the designed peptide l-methylimidazole-2-carboxamidenetropsin. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 7586-7590 (1992); Trauger, J.W., Baird, E. E. Dervan, P.B. describes the recognition of DNA by designed ligands at subnanomolar concentrations. Nature 382, 559-561 (1996). A 

Py/Py pair specifies A«T from G*C but does not distinguish A«T from T»A. Pelton, J.G. & Wemmer, D.E. describes the structural
