<ABSTRACT>
A safety relay has a guided contact set (16) and a monostable drive with a H-armature (6). The individual contacts of the set of contacts (16) are located in separate chambers and are actuated by a common actuator (20). In order to miniaturise the relay while having a low power consumption, a mechanically symmetrical H armature (6) with an asymmetrical magnetic effect is provided to ensure the monostable drive. The longitudinal axis of the H-armature (6) is approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis of the driving coil and the axis of rotation of the H-armature is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the driving coil. The actuator (20) is actuated by an actuating plate (49) which prolongs the H armature.

<CLAIMS>
A safety relay with an automatically guided contact set 
and poled monostable drive, in which the individual contact 

spring sets (16) are compartmentalized with respect to each 
other, and an H-armature (6) is provided for driving, which 

is arranged with its longitudinal axis approximately 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the drive coil (4) and 

the rotation axis (11) of which is perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the drive coil (3), characterised in 

that the H-armature (6) is constructed so as to be 
mechanically symmetrical through two armature plates (7, 8) 

arranged parallel to each other, between which yoke shanks 

(4,5) engage, and so as to be magnetically asymmetrical 
through arrangement of a permanent magnet (9) between the 

armature plates (7,8), and the H-armature is mounted 
rotatably in an approximately U-shaped bearing piece (10) 

defined by the contact set carrier (2) and asymmetrically, 
in diagonally opposite parts of the armature plates (7, 8) 

recesses (40, 41) are provided, which have a dia- or 
paramagnetic material, in which the actuator (20) is moved 

by an actuator plate (49) arranged in an extension of the H-armature 
(6) and actuates the contact spring sets (16) 

jointly.
