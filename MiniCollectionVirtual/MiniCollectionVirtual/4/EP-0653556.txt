<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus, and a corresponding method for its 
operation, for controlling the air/fuel ratio in a large 

engine having one or more banks of cylinders with separate 
intake and exhaust manifolds. Oxygen sensors in the manifolds 

are sampled periodically to provide the apparatus with an 
indication of the level of oxygen, and therefore an indication 

of the level of various pollutants, in exhaust gases discharged 
from the engine. The apparatus, preferably in 

microprocessor form, computes a fuel control correction based 
on the difference between the sensed oxygen level and a 

desired oxygen level in each exhaust manifold. The correction 
is applied in the form of a change to the pulse width of a 

binary control signal applied to a solenoid valve. In the 
illustrative embodiment, the solenoid valve is coupled to a 

fuel pressure regulator and functions to vent an air chamber 
in the regulator when the solenoid is actuated. Changing the 

pulse width of the control signal varies the average fuel 
pressure and thereby controls the air/fuel ratio, which in 

turn corrects the oxygen level in the exhaust manifold. The 
controller also monitors various temperatures in the engine 

and selectively disables control of the air/fuel ratio when 
selected temperatures fall outside assigned limits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to air/fuel 
mixture controllers for large internal combustion engines used 
in industrial applications, such as for power generation and 
natural gas compression. More particularly, the invention 
relates to engines of this type that employ gaseous fuel and 
a carburetor to mix the fuel and air. Emission control 
regulations may require operators of large industrial engines 
to reduce pollution rates by as much as 90% below current 
levels. Users of four-stroke engines fueled by natural gas can 
treat exhaust gases chemically in a catalytic converter, which 
converts offending pollutants, such as oxides of nitrogen 
(NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane hydrocarbons, to 
much less harmful substances: nitrogen, carbon dioxide (CO₂) 
and water (H₂O). Unfortunately, converter technology is not 
always sufficient to effect this conversion, unless the 
chemical balance of offensive pollutants entering the 
catalytic converter is maintained at a precise ratio. 
Maintaining the balance of pollutants entering the converter 
is effected by controlling the ratio of air to fuel input to 
the combustion engine. Typically, the air/fuel ratio is controlled in 
response to measurement of the concentration of oxygen in the 
engine exhaust. The fuel pressure is increased or decreased 
on a continuous basis to maintain the oxygen concentration in 
the engine exhaust at a selected level corresponding to a 
desired chemical composition of pollutants in the exhaust 
gases. Continuously variable control of the fuel pressure 
requires the use of relatively costly stepper motor valves, 
and may also require modification of fuel line plumbing, 
modification of air induction components, and the addition of 
an external air or gas supply. Therefore, there is a need for 
a simple, inexpensive, yet convenient and reliable technique 
for controlling the air/fuel ratio in a large, industrial 
internal combustion engine. The present invention satisfies  
 
this need. The present invention resides in an air/fuel 
controller for large gas-fueled engines. An important aspect 
of the invention is its use of a simple solenoid-operated 
valve that is duty-cycle-modulated to achieve a desired 
air/fuel ratio without the use of proportionally controlled 
valves, such as expensive stepper motor valves. In one of its embodiments, the invention may 
be defined as air/fuel ratio control apparatus for use with 
an engine having one or more banks of cylinders with separate 
intake and exhaust manifolds.
