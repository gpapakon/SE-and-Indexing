<ABSTRACT>
A hollow cylindrical plunger (4) has an open proximal end 
slidably fitted in a hollow cylindrical casing (1). A piston (7) 

in the casing (1) has a head (11) slidably fitted in the plunger 
(4) and carried by the free end of a rod (8) having its other end 

fixed to the casing (1). The hollow plunger (4) itself 
constitutes part of the hydraulic fluid reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydraulic linear speed 
controllers, also known as hydraulic check units, for regulating 
the speed or feed rate of any moving device. A hydraulic check is an elongate unit comprising two 
telescopic parts which, in use, are kinematically connected to 
two relatively movable bodies which are to be moved by a powered 
device, e.g. a pneumatic piston. As the length of the unit 
decreases, hydraulic fluid is transferred between chambers of 
variable volume through a restrictor which limits the rate of 
flow and therefore limits the speed of relative movement of the 
two bodies. This full power can be applied to the powered device 
or piston, without the risk of an excessive feed rate. In one well-known hydraulic check unit, a piston rod extends 
from one end of a casing. The stroke length of the check is very 
short in relation to the overall length (e.g. a ratio of 76 mm/ 
350 mm). What is desired is a hydraulic check unit which is of 
smaller overall length, for the same stroke length. The present invention provides a hydraulic linear speed 
controller comprising: a hollow cylindrical casing open at one 
end and closed at the other end; a hollow cylindrical plunger 
which is coaxial with the casing, the plunger having an open 
proximal end which is slidably fitted in the casing and a closed 
distal end which projects from the open end of the casing; and a 
piston which is coaxial with the casing, the piston having a head  
 
which is slidably fitted in the plunger and a rod having a free 
end which carries the head and a fixed end which is connected to 
the casing. Passage means communicate between the interior of the 
plunger beyond the piston and the interior of the casing, via the 
piston, in a preferred embodiment, the passage means including 
restricting means for limiting the rate of flow of hydraulic 
fluid through the passage means as the plunger is pushed into the 
casing. Since the hollow plunger itself constitutes part of the 
hydraulic fluid reservoir, the overall length of the controller 
can be reduced in comparison with a controller having a solid 
piston as a plunger, without any substantial increase in the 
diameter of the casing. In a preferred embodiment, a rolling seal surrounds the 
piston rod in the casing. One end of the rolling seal is 
sealingly connected to the proximal end of the plunger and the 
other end is sealingly connected to the fixed end of the piston 
rod so as to delimit an inner region communicating with the 
interior of the plunger and an
