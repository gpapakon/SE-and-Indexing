 CONFORMATIONALLY RESTRICTED MIMETICS OF REVERSE TURNS AND PEPTIDES CONTAINING THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Government Support Portions of this invention were supported by National ScienceFoundation Grant CHE-8657046 and National Institute of Health Grant GM-38260. The Government has certain rights to this invention.1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to peptide mimetics. Peptide mimetics are compositionally well defined, configurationally constrained chemical structures which can serve as surrogates for peptides or proteins in their interactions with receptors, antibodies, and/or enzymes. This invention also relates to a means for three dimensional analysis of specific interactions between peptides and proteins and the complementary regions on receptors, antibodies and enzymes, as well as the development of new therapeutic agents through the use of peptide mimetics.2. Summary of the Related ArtPeptides and proteins play critical roles in the regulation of all biological processes. Peptides, for example, play a regulatory role as hormones and inhibitors, and are also involved in immunological recognition. The significant biological role of 

peptides makes important the understanding of the interactions between peptides and their receptors or enzymes to which they bind.The determination of the receptor-bound conformation of a peptide is invaluable for the rational design of peptide analogues. However, Marshall et al., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. U: 227-238 (1978), discloses that peptides are characteristically highly flexible molecules, the structures of which are strongly influenced by the environment in which they reside. Thus solution structural studies of peptides are not generally useful for determining their receptor- bound conformation.As no approach is available to predict a priori which new ligand-receptor interactions will lead to antagonists and which will lead to agonists of greater or less potency, it is necessary to perform classical structure-function studies in a systematic way to provide information about the specific amino acid residues and functional groups in a peptide that are important to biological activity. Studies of this nature can utilize conformationally constrained peptide mimetics. For example, Hruby, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 8,: 336-339 (1987), suggests that conformational constraints can provide information about the different requirements that a receptor has for a ligand to be an agonist or antagonist.Generally, peptide mimetics can be defined as structures
