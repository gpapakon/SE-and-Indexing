<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel class of dimeric piperidine, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
and piperazine derivatives in which the nitrogen atoms of the six-membered
basic rings are linked together via a spacer chain to form a symmetrical
dimeric bis(1-piperidyl), bis(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-1-pyridyl), or bis(1-piperazinyl)
compound. These dimers potently bind to sigma receptors and are therefore useful
in the treatment of certain psychic and neurologic disorders. The piperidines,
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines, or piperazines are substituted with 4-phenyl groups or
the piperidine derivatives might be spiro-joined in the 4-position to a hetero- or
carbocyclic ring system.Various 4-phenylpiperidine, 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines, 4-phenylpiperazines,
and spirocyclic piperidine derivatives have previously been described :International Patent Application No WO 91/09594 generically describes a broad
class of sigma receptor ligands some of which are 4-phenylpiperidine, -tetrahydropyridine
or -piperazine compounds having an optionally substituted "aryl"- or
"heteroaryl" -alkyl, -alkenyl, -alkynyl, -alkoxy or -alkoxyalkyl substituent on the ring
N-atom. The terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" are defined by mention of a number of
such substituents.European patent publication No EP 0 414 289 Al generically discloses a class of
1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-spiro[naphthalene-1,4'-piperidine] and 1,4-dihydro-spiro[naphthalene-1,4'-piperidine]
derivatives substituted at the piperidine N-atom with a
"hydrocarbon" group alleged to have selective sigma receptor antagonistic activity.
The term "hydrocarbon" as defined in said patent covers all possible straight
chained, cyclic, heterocyclic, etc. groups. However, only compounds having benzyl,
phenethyl, cycloalkylmethyl, furyl- or thienylmethyl or lower alkyl or alkenyl as the
"hydrocarbon" substituent at the piperidine nitrogen atom are specifically disclosed.
The compounds are stated to displace tritiated di-tolyl guanidine (DTG) from sigma
sites with potencies better than 200 nM. As a particularly preferred compound is
mentioned 1'-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-spiro[naphthalene-1,4'-piperidine]. European patent publication No EP 0 445 974 A2 generically describes the
corresponding spiro[indane-1,4'-piperidine] and spiro[benzocycloheptene-5,4'-piperidine]
derivatives. Again the compounds are only stated to displace tritiated di-tolyl
guanidine (DTG) from sigma sites with potencies better than 200 nMEP Application No. EP-A2-0 431 943 relates to a further extremely broad class of
