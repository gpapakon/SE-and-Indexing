<ABSTRACT>
A packaging for cigarettes and cigars or similar smoking products (6) consists of a box (1) with a hinged lid (4) and an inner wrapper (7), inserted into the box and enclosing a number of cigarettes, cigars or similar smoking products, the upper part (9) of the inner wrapper being able to be pulled off from the lower part (10) thereof. According to the invention, the lower region of the inner space of the box (1), remote from the hinged lid (4), is narrower in cross-section than the region of the box inner space located above it, in a manner such that surface pressure is exerted in this lower region between the smoking products (6) and the inner wrapper (7). Moreover, the upper part (9) of the inner wrapper, which can be pulled off, extends approximately to the upper edge of the cross-sectional constriction (5).

top as well as an inner wrapping. which is inserted 
into the box and encloses a number of tobacco products 

and of which the top part is removable from the bottom 
part of the inner wrapping, the interior of the box 

receiving the tobacco products being narrower in its 
bottom region remote from the flip top (4) than in the 

region of the box interior situated above,
 
characterized in that the bottom region of the 

interior of the box (1) is made narrower in cross 
section than its top region so as to produce in said 

bottom region between the tobacco products (6) and the 
inner wrapping (7) a surface pressure which holds the 

tobacco products firmly in the box, and that the top 

removable part (9) of the inner wrapping extends 
approximately as far as the top edge of the cross-sectional 

constriction (5). 
Pack according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
top edge of the cross-sectional constriction (5) is 

situated at a distance from the box base (2) which 
corresponds to, at most, a third of the box height. 
Pack according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
bottom region of the interior of the box (1) is made 

narrower than the top region by means of a strip of 
material (5) which is mounted onto the inner surface 

of at least one box wall (3). 
Pack according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
strip of material (5) is glued onto the inside of the 

box walls (3).  
 
Pack according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
strip of material (5) extends annularly around the 

interior of the box (1). 
Pack according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
bottom region of the box interior is made narrower by 

means of grooves (11) embossed in at least one of the 
box walls (3). 
Pack according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
top removable part (9) and the bottom part (10), which 

is left in the box (1), of the inner wrapping (7) are 
connected to one another by a perforation line (8). 
Pack according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
bottom part (10) of the inner wrapping (7) is glued to 

the bottom constricted region (5) of the box (1).
