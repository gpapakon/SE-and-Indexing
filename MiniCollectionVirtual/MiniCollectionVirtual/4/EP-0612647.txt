<ABSTRACT>
A device for protecting the passenger compartment of rail vehicles during a collision of railway trains, in which device at least two, preferably three, successive, stable carriers (1, 3 and 6) extending transversely with respect to the direction of travel are provided at the head side in the underframe and/or in the roof part, between which carriers (1, 3 and 6), impact-absorbing and deformable elements (2,4) which preferably consist of corrugated sheet metal are provided. The depressions and peaks of the corrugations extend in the direction of travel. The head-side carrier has, in plan view, a triangular shape with flattened tip and is constructed at the underframe as a buffer carrier (1). The further stable carrier (3) which is arranged with the intermediate connection of a deformation element (2) is constructed to be congruent with the carrier (1).

<CLAIMS>
Railway carriage, having a region provided at 
each end which becomes deformed in the event of a 

collision, the middle region of the carriage body 
remaining undamaged as far as possible, the body of the 

rail vehicle having at least one rigid support (1) 
extending transversely to the direction of travel at both 

its ends on the underframe side and/or on the roof side 
in a manner known per se and, adjoining the said support, 

at least one deformation element (2), characterized in 
that the rigid support (1) extending transversely to the 

direction of travel essentially has a triangular shape in 
the plan view and, adjoining the deformation element (2), 

a second rigid support (3) is designed to be congruent 
with the first support (1). 
Railway carriage according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the first rigid support (1) is designed 

with a flattened end which is directed towards the middle 
of the carriage, and the deformation element (2) runs 

congruently between the two supports (1, 2). 
Railway carriage according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a further deformation element (4) is 

provided adjoining the second support (3), viewed in the 
direction of travel, which is supported at its end remote 

from the support (3) on a further support (6) which is 
braced between edge supports and runs in the region of 

the beginning of the passenger region, and the first 
deformation element (2), viewed in the direction of 

travel, is plastically deformable and the second deformation 
element (4) is elastically and then plastically  

 
deformable during the plastic deformation of the first 

deformation element (2). 
Railway carriage according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the height of the plastically deformable 

deformation element (2) is greater than the height of the 
further elastically and plastically deformable deformation 

element (4). 
Railway carriage according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the first, plastically deformable 

deformation element (2) extends at least at one lateral 
end up to the access region of the rail vehicle, and its 

end preferably merges into a tread plate (9). 
Railway carriage according to one of Claims 3 to 
5, characterized in that the first rigid support (1) 

bears the buffers (11, 11') on the underframe and the 
central buffer coupling or the coupling hook (10), the 

walls of the second support (3) facing the first rigid 
support (1) running parallel to the opposite walls of the 

first rigid support (1). 
Railway carriage according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that at least one part 

of at least one of the two lateral supports is designed 
as a deformable, preferably box-shaped, support (5). 
Railway carriage according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a duct for 

guiding the electric cables and/or other lines is provided 
between the rigid support (3) and the crossmember 

(6) in the region of the deformation element (4), which 
duct opens out into a passage (8) in the second support, 

and the lines, brake parts, pipes for water, waste water 
and others are routed in the second support (3) or in its 

sloping arms.
