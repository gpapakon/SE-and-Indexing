<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for immobilizing material 
contaminated with heavy metal ions, said metal ions in a 

liquid environment being allowed to react with a metal-complexing 
agent with the formation of a metal complex, the 

metal-complex formed being mixed, in the presence of water, 
with an inorganic, hydraulic binder comprising blast 

furnace slag cement, fly ash cement or a combination 
thereof to form a matrix having reductive properties in the 

form of a hard, rocklike material, which method is 
characterized in that said metal complex is formed in the 

presence of a metal-complex bond activator. Said metal-complex 
bond activator is preferably a water-soluble salt 

of a transition metal element, expediently ferric chloride 
or manganese sulphate. The invention also relates to a 

fixant for immobilizing heavy metal ions comprised in waste 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for immobilizing 
material contaminated with heavy metal ions, said metal 
ions in a liquid environment being allowed to react with a 
complexing agent with the formation of a metal complex, the 
complex formed being mixed, in the presence of water, with 
an inorganic, hydraulic binder comprising blast furnace 
slag cement, fly ash cement or a combination thereof to 
form a matrix having reductive properties in the form of a 
hard, rocklike material. A method for immobilizing material contaminated 
with inorganic toxic compounds and elements is known from 
EP-A-0 535 758. To form a metal complex, the trimercapto-S-triazine 
trisodium salt is used in this known process. Incidentally, the use of mercapto-S-triazine salts 
for removing noxious metals from wastewater is known per se 
from the French Patent No. 2,149,546. This publication, 
however, exclusively teaches the possibility of removing 
metals from a waste stream, with the aid of a mercapto-S-triazine 
salt, by the formation of a precipitate. The 
problems which can arise if the precipitate formed is to be 
immobilized by incorporating it in a matrix of a hydraulic 
binder are not discussed here. It was found, however, that adequate immobilization 
of material contaminated with metals, especially with heavy 
metals, was not always possible, notwithstanding the fact 
that the removal yield was good owing to the addition of 
such a complexing agent. The product obtained after setting 
then gave, in such cases, in various leaching tests, 
unacceptably high leaching values of the various 
constituents with the lapse of time. It is assumed that this is a consequence of the 
fact that, in the metal complex formed, the bond of the 
metal ion is somewhat oxidation-sensitive and can therefore 
readily be broken, the metal ion in question being  
 
liberated in the process. The complex formed is therefore mixed, in the 
presence of water, with an inorganic, hydraulic binder to 
form a matrix having reductive properties in the form of a 
hard, stonelike material. Owing to the presence of a matrix having reductive 
properties, leaching of metal ions will be reduced after 
time has passed, because the oxidative behaviour which may 
be associated with leaching under natural conditions can at 
least partially be compensated for by such a matrix. The 
bond of the metal ions to the complexing agent therefore 
will mainly remain intact, as a result of which no leaching 
of metal can occur. The inorganic hydraulic binder used is
