<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production 
of poly(lactic acid) with a high molecular weight from the 
lactic acid monomer. It is generally known that polyesters of the poly(lactic 
acid) type do not achieve good properties until their molecular 
weights are at least 25,000. The term poly(lactic acid) "with a 
high molecular weight" as used in the present description thus 
means a poly(lactic acid) which has a molecular weight of at 
least 25,000. It is known that free lactic acid can be subjected to direct 
polycondensation, but the polycondensation reaction is an 
equilibrium reaction which is difficult to shift towards the 
formation of the desired product properties. It is particularly 
difficult to shift the reaction because the water produced in 
the course of the reaction distills from the highly viscous melt 
very slowly. These difficulties persist even if antimony oxide 
is used as a polycondensation catalyst, as proposed in the literature. For these reasons, in order to prepare polymers with high 
molecular weights, lactic acid is converted into lactide, the 
polymerization of which by ring opening is described extensively 
in the literature. The lactide is produced from lactic acid via 
the initial formation of oligomeric lactic acid by the dehydration 
of aqueous lactic acid, followed by a catalytic transesterification 
reaction known as a "back-biting" reaction. The catalysts proposed for the above reaction include tin 
powder, tin halides, tin carboxylates (EP-A-0 261 572 and EP-A-0  
 
275 581), tin alkoxides (GB 1,007,347) and zinc or tin (EP-A-0 
264 926 and USP 4,797,468). The polymerization of the intermediate lactide by the opening 
of its ring is carried out with the use of initiators such 
as Sn (II) salts which are sensitive both to hydrolysis 
reactions and to degradative oxidation reactions. Since the presence 
of only traces of water, lactic acid or other impurities 
in the intermediate lactide are sufficient to de-activate the 
initiator or the growing chain, a precise purification of the 
crude lactide is necessary and, as described in the literature, 
is carried out by repeated crystallizations, normally at least 
three, and by means of a final drying step at 45° under vacuum 
for several hours. The need of a purification of the lactide, which is done in 
batches, involves a substantial increase in the cost of producing 
the desired poly(lactic acid) with a high molecular weight. It has now been found that, if the polycondensation of free 
lactic acid is
