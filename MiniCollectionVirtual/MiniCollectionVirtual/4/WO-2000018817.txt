<ABSTRACT>
Microcellular elastomers and a process for making them are disclosed. The process comprises reacting a resin component ("B" side) with an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer ("A" side). Pre-reacting the right proportion of chain extender into an "A" side that also includes a high-primary, low-unsaturation polyol is the key to making low-density (less than 0.5 g/cm

) microcellular elastomers while avoiding problems with poor processing or inferior physical properties. The process is easy to practice, and provides lighter, high-quality polyurethane products, including protective sports equipment, arm rests or steering wheels for the auto industry, and midsoles or shoe soles for footwear.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR MAKING MICROCELLULAR POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERSFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to microcellular polyurethane elastomers and a process for making them. The elastomers are valuable for a variety of uses, most notably in automotive applications and footwear.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Microcellular polyurethane elastomers are well known. They have fine, evenly distributed cells, and densities that are low compared with solid urethane elastomers yet high compared with flexible polyurethane foam. Microcellular polyurethane elastomers are used in automotive parts (e.g., bumpers and armrests), gaskets, vibration damping applications, and footwear.While many ways to make microcellular polyurethane elastomers have been revealed, most approaches fit into two categories: the "one- shot" method and the "prepolymer" method. In the one-shot method, all of the components (polyols, polyisocyanate, blowing agents, surfactant, catalyst, chain extenders) are combined and reacted in a single step. In contrast, the prepolymer approach pre-reacts the polyisocyanate with a polyol to make a "prepolymer" (the "A" side) that is subsequently combined with the remaining reactants including any chain extenders (the "B" side), in a second step to make the elastomer. As U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,366 illustrates, it can be beneficial to make a "quasiprepolymer" by using an by reacting the polyol with enough polyisocyanate to produce a mixture of isocyanate-terminated prepolymer and free polyisocyanate. Such quasiprepolymers are commonly used to boost the available NCO content of the "A" side.It is also known to prepare prepolymers ("A" sides) from isocyanates and polyol-chain extender mixtures. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,959- l - 

teaches to make an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer from MDI, dipropylene glycol, a polyoxypropylated/ethoxylated glycerine, and a polyoxypropylated/ethoxylated glycol (see Example 1). The reference polyols have up to 35 wt.% of ethylene oxide content, but an undisclosed degree of "endcapping" or primary hydroxyl group content (see column 5, lines 17-38). The reference is also silent regarding the unsaturation level of the polyols. U.S. Pat. No. 5,618,967 contains a similar disclosure. In sum, these references suggest that neither the unsaturation level nor the primary hydroxyl content of the polyols is important. U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,880 also shows (see, e.g., column 13, lines 30-45) a prepolymer made from an isocyanate, a polyol, and a chain extender (dipropylene glycol). This
