<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system control
method and a system control apparatus both of which are
suitable for use in system control of multimedia devices
capable of handling various kinds of information such as
texts, sound, still images and moving images.In recent years, so-called AV devices which have
chiefly relied on analog techniques, such as audio equipment,
video equipment and television sets, have been being
digitized more and more. As digitization of text information
and still image information becomes more popular, text
information, sound information, still-image information and
moving-image information are beginning to be unitarily
handled within computers.However, if currently available multimedia devices
(for example, sound input/output devices and image
input/output devices such as digital cameras, CD-ROM players,
scanners, sound boards and video boards) are to be utilized
on a computer, it has been necessary to install application
software or device drivers dedicated to driving the
respective multimedia devices on the computer.The above-described art has the problem that new
software or device drivers must be prepared for new
multimedia devices in each computer or OS (Operating System)
and software development becomes a heavy burden and efficient 
and high-rapid control is impossible.Another problem is that the above-described art
generally does not allow a computer connected to a LAN (local
area network) to transparently use a multimedia device
connected to a different point of the LAN. Accordingly, it
has been impossible to realize the concept of a multimedia
system to enable a plurality of computers to access
individual peripheral devices via a LAN.It is known from EP-A-0549504 to provide central
control of network resources by a process control manager
which models the network resources, representing a
process being controlled by an object. The process
control manager is arranged such that changes made to the
model cause corresponding changes to be implemented in
the network resources.It is also known from EP-A-0488178 to control
domestic appliances by room controllers which are
connected via a bus to a control computer having a
display which represents the status of appliances
pictographically. Programs to operate the system are
stored in ROM in the control computer.One object of the present invention is to realize a
highly versatile system environment suitable for control
of multimedia devices.Another object of the present invention is to
improve the efficiency of control
