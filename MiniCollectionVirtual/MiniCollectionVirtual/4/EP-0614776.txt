<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a frame (1) for a window in a door 
of a vehicle, the frame being (1):

 
   shaped so as to constitute all three (3,4,5,6) of an "A" 

post, a top rail and a "B" post;
 

   formed from a single length of extruded metal 
around at least part of which has been extruded an 

elastomeric material; and
 

   provided with a glass run channel (10) defined at least 
in part by at least part of the elastomeric material. 

Methods for producing the frame are also disclosed.
 

The invention obviates (i) the need to fit subsequently 
a separately extruded glass run channel to a channel-shaped 

region of the door frame, and (ii) the need to 
join sections of the door frame to each other, usually 

at the corners of the door frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a window frame for a 
vehicle door, to a method of forming such a frame, and 
to a vehicle door which includes such a frame. The construction of a motor vehicle door which 
includes a window frame with provision for upward and 
downward movement of a sheet of glazing material is 
elaborate, time-consuming and expensive. Various attempts have been proposed to reduce the 
difficulties associated with the constructional 
techniques involved but, even though some progress has 
been made on this front, nonetheless the currently 
available constructional techniques all have their own 
short-comings. One reason for the difficulties associated with 
constructing a frame of a window of a vehicle door is 
that often different criteria need to be met in the 
different regions of the frame, particularly in the 
regions of the so-called "A" post, the top rail and the 
"B" post, these being well-known terms in the vehicle 
construction industry for parts of a vehicle front door 
window frame. Similar considerations can apply to the 
frame of a window of a rear door of a vehicle, where 
one is concerned with the "B" post, the top rail, and 
the "C" post. Comparable considerations also can apply 
to the two posts and top rail of a tailgate of an 
estate car or station wagon, which has an openable 
window in the tailgate. The term "door" as used herein 
covers a tailgate. In one conventional technique for constructing the 
frame of a window the upper regions of the frame are 
first formed often by the joining of an inner part and 
an outer part of the door frame, to define a channel-shaped 
region, into which is subsequently fitted a 
conventional elastomeric channel-shaped glass run  
 
channel which typically is provided with sealing lips 
and is provided with flock or some other system to 
reduce friction between the moving sheet of glazing 
material and the glass run channel. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a frame for a window in a 
door of a vehicle: 
   wherein the frame is shaped so as to constitute 
(i) all three of an "A" post, a top rail and a "B" 
post, (ii) all three of a "B" post, a top rail and a 
"C" post, or (iii) all three of two posts and a top 
rail of a tailgate; 
   wherein the frame is formed from a single length 
of rolled metal; 
   wherein a part of the length of rolled metal, as 
viewed in cross-section, defines a glass run channel; 
and 
   wherein an elastomeric material has been extruded 
onto at least part of the length of

A frame (1) for a window in a door of a 
vehicle:
 
   wherein the frame is shaped so as to constitute 

(i) all three of an "A" post, a top rail and a "B" 
post, (ii) all three of a "B" post, a top rail and a 

"C" post, or (iii) all three of two posts and a top

   wherein the frame is formed from a single length 

of rolled metal;
 
   wherein a part of the length of rolled metal, as 

viewed in cross-section, defines a glass run channel; 
and
 
   wherein an elastomeric material (13) has been 

extruded onto at least part of the length of metal, 
with at least part of the elastomeric material forming 

a seal (14, 15) intended in use to abut a reciprocating 
sheet of glazing material as it moves upwardly and 

downwardly. 
A frame (1) for a window in a door of a 
vehicle:
 
   wherein the frame is shaped so as to constitute 

(i) all three of an "A" post, a top rail and a "B" 
post, (ii) all three of a "B" post, a top rail and a 

"C" post, or (iii) all three of two posts and a top 
rail of a tailgate;
 
   wherein the frame is formed from a single length 

of extruded metal;
 
   wherein a part of the length of extruded metal, as 

viewed in cross-section, defines a glass run channel; 
and
 
   wherein an elastomeric material (13) has been 

extruded onto at least part of the length of metal, 
with at least part of the elastomeric material forming 

a seal (14, 15) intended in use to abut a reciprocating

A frame according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
another part of the elastomeric material is intended to 

serve as a door seal (12).

the metal is aluminium or a steel, and/or wherein the 

frame has, in cross-section, a closed tubular portion. 
A frame according to any preceding claim,

sponge door seal (12). 
A method of forming a frame for a window in a 
door of a vehicle, as claimed in Claim 1, the method 

comprising: 

shaping a strip of a metal to the desired cross-sectional 
configuration, which includes a glass run 

channel (10); 
extruding an elastomeric material around at least

"C" post, or (iii) all three of two posts and a top 
rail of a tailgate, of a vehicle door window frame.
