<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) is provided for 
commonly connecting a plurality of conductors (12), such as 

insulated conductor wires. An insulating housing (14) has 
a wire-receiving face (24), a base (26) and generally 

parallel side walls (20) extending between the base and the 
face, defining an elongated cavity (28) therewithin. A 

strip (16) of terminal devices (18) is assembled in the 
elongated cavity. Each terminal device includes at least 

one insulation-displacement wire-terminating slot (36) for 
reception of an insulated conductor wire. Wire-admitting 

slots (46) are provided in each housing side wall aligned 
with the wire-terminating slots in the terminal devices. 

Each wire-admitting slot includes a first, wire-restraining 
section (50) for temporarily holding an insulated conductor 

wire prior to insertion into the respective wire-terminating 
slot, and a second, wire-securing section (52) 

for finally holding the insulated conductor wire when 
inserted into the wire-terminating slot. The terminal 

devices (18) are joined in the strip by web portions (40) 
structured to be readily broken to facilitate severing the 

strip (16) of terminal devices at any location between any 
two adjacent devices (18). The housing (14) includes 

access apertures (42) through which the web portions (40) 
can be broken from outside the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical 
connector for commonly connecting a plurality of conductors 
or wires. Electrical connector apparatus have been provided 
for commonly connecting a plurality of conductors. An 
early commoning connector device included an insulating 
support on which at least one metallic junction bar or 
terminal strip was mounted. Clamping devices or screws 
were used to clamp the ends of the conductors to the 
junction bar to thereby interconnect the conductors to one 
another. In the case of insulated conductor wires, the 
ends of the wires were stripped to expose the conductor 
ends for clamping. Crimping-type terminals also have been 
used on such junction bars or strips to common the 
conductors. From such early commoning connectors, 
improvements have been made, such as providing the 
connectors with insulation-displacement terminals so that 
the insulated conductor wires do not have to be prepared by 
stripping the insulation therefrom. An example of such a 
commoning connector is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,227,763 
to Marks, dated October 14, 1980. This invention is directed to providing a 
commoning connector of the character described which 
includes further improvements, such as features for preliminarily 
or temporarily holding the wires prior to  
 
termination, and for severing a junction bar or terminal 
strip to a desired length from a continuous terminal strip. An object, therefore, of the invention is to 
provide a new and improved electrical connector for 
commonly connecting a plurality of conductors such as 
insulated conductor wires. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the 
connector includes an insulating housing having generally 
parallel side walls extending between a wire-receiving face 
and a base or bottom wall, thereby defining an elongated 
terminal strip-receiving cavity therewithin. A strip of 
terminal devices is mounted in the elongated cavity. Each 
terminal device includes at least one insulation-displacement 
wire-terminating slot for reception of an 
insulated conductor wire. Wire-admitting slots are 
provided in each side wall of the housing, with the wire-admitting 
slots being aligned with the wire-terminating 
slots of the terminal devices. The invention contemplates that each wire-admitting 
slot in the side walls of the housing include a 
first, wire-restraining section for temporarily holding an 
insulated conductor wire prior to insertion into the 
respective

An electrical connector (10) for commonly 
connecting a plurality of insulated conductor wires (12), 

comprising: 

an insulating housing (14) having generally 
parallel side walls (20) defining an elongated terminal 

strip-receiving cavity (28) therebetween, 
a strip (16) of terminal devices (18) in the 
elongated cavity of the housing, each terminal device 

including at least one insulation-displacement wire-terminating 
slot (36) for reception of an insulated 

conductor wire, and 
wire-admitting slots (46) in each of said side 
walls, the wire-admitting slots being aligned with the 

wire-terminating slots (36) in the terminal devices (18), 
each wire-admitting slot including a first, wire-restraining 

section (50) for temporarily holding an 
insulated conductor wire prior to insertion into the 

respective wire-terminating slot and a second, wire-securing 
section (52) for finally holding the insulated 

conductor wire when inserted into the wire-terminating 
slot. 
The electrical connector of claim 1 wherein 
each of said terminal devices (18) includes a pair of plate 

portions (34a, 34b) generally parallel to said side walls 
(20), each plate portion having one of said insulation-displacement 

wire-terminating slots (36) therein. 
The electrical connector of claim 2 wherein 
each of said terminal devices (18) is generally U-shaped 

with a pair of legs (34a, 34b) integrally joined by a bight 
portion (38), the legs defining said plate portions.  

 
The electrical connector of claim 3 wherein 
said terminal devices (18) are integrally joined at their 

bight portions (38) by web portions (40) to define said 
strip of terminal devices. 
The electrical connector of claim 4 wherein 
said web portions (40) are structured to be readily broken 

to facilitate severing the strip (16) of terminal devices 
at any location between any two adjacent terminal devices 

(18). 
The electrical connector of claim 5, 
including access means (42) in said housing (14), 

through which said web portions (40) can be broken from 
outside the housing. 
The electrical connector of claim 6 wherein 
said housing (14) includes a wire-receiving face (24) with 

which said cavity (28), said wire-terminating slots (36) 
and said wire-admitting slots (46) communicate, and a 

bottom wall (26) spanning said side walls (20), said access 
means comprising apertures (42) in the bottom wall (26).
