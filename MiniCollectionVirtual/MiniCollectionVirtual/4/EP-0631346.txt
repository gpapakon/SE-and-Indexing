<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector comprises a tubular 
connector member (1;1';6) having a generally axial 

opening (13;12';64) for receiving a cable (4), terminal 
means comprising a terminal carrier (2;2') or plug (7) 

and cable supporting means (3;8) located within the 
opening (13;12';64). The connector member (1;1';6) is 

threadedly engaged with a connector housing (5;9) at its 
end nearest the cable supporting means (3;8). As the 

connector housing (5;9) is tightened onto the tubular 
connector member (1;1';6) the cable (4) is urged against 

the cable supporting means (3;8) and thereby bent and 
pinched between the housing (5;9) and the end of the 

cable supporting means (3;8). In preferred 
arrangements, protrusions (36,36;84,84) are also 

provided on the cable supporting means (3;8) for digging 
into the cable (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors, 
and more particularly to microphone connectors. Known electrical connectors of U.S. Patent No. 
4,647,127 and NO. 4,657,327 use a cable pinching method 
wherein a ring 26 engages a connector member 13, forcing 
a tubular clamping sleeve 7 to open its rear end 8 for 
clamping a cable. However, the clamping sleeve is 
tubular, so a great force has to be used to engage a 
female thread of a ring with a housing when clamping a 
large diameter cable in the clamping sleeve. Persons 
working continually to assemble this kind of connector 
may become extremely tired and in severe cases the right 
thumb may become painful or grow watery swells. In this 
case, the person may have to stop his work after 
engaging thirty or forty of such known connectors. DE-A-2 647 043 discloses an electrical connector in 
which a connector housing is threadedly engaged with a 
pressure component located in a generally axially 
extending opening within a connector member, so as to 
pull the pressure component against an inclined surface 
of the connector member and exert a retaining force on a 
cable by virtue of a wedging action. This has certain 
disadvantages. Viewed from one aspect, the present invention 
provides an electrical connector comprising a tubular 
connector member having a generally axially extending 
opening therein, a connector housing, terminal means 
located in use within said connector member for 
connecting to a cable located within said generally 
axial opening, and cable supporting means located in use 
within said generally axial opening of said connector 
member, characterised in that said connector housing is 
threadedly engageable with said connector member at a 
cable receiving end thereof being an end of said  
 
connector member which receives a said cable, said cable 
supporting means includes an annular or 
part annular wall portion for locating about a said 
cable and an elongate cable supporting portion 
extending from said wall portion towards said cable 
receiving end of said connector member, said elongate 
cable supporting portion turning radially inwardly at 
the end thereof which is nearest said cable receiving 
end of said connector member, the arrangement being such 
that when said connector housing is threadedly engaged 
with said connector member and tightened, said elongate 
cable supporting portion is pressed inwards by an inner 
surface of said connector housing so as to pinch and 
thereby secure a said cable within the connector.

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector comprising a tubular 
connector member (1;1';6) having a generally axially 

extending opening (13;12';64) therein, a connector 
housing (5;9), terminal means (2;
2';7) located in use 
within said connector member (1;1';6) for connecting to 

a cable located within said generally axial opening 
(13;12';64), and cable supporting means (3;8) located in 

use within said generally axial opening (13;12';64) of 
said connector member (1;1';6), characterised in that 

said connector housing (5;9) is threadedly engageable 
with said connector member (1;1';6) at a cable receiving 

end thereof being an end of said connector member (1; 
1';6) which receives a said cable, said cable supporting 

means includes an annular or part annular 
wall portion (30;80) for locating about a said cable 

and an elongate cable supporting portion (34;82) 
extending from said wall portion (30;80) towards said 

cable receiving end of said connector member (1;1';6), 
said elongate cable supporting portion (34;82) turning 

radially inwardly at the end thereof which is nearest 
said cable receiving end of said connector member 

(1;1';6), the arrangement being such that when said 
connector housing (5;9) is threadedly engaged with said 

connector member (1;1';6) and tightened, said elongate 
cable supporting portion (34;82) is pressed inwards by 

an inner surface of said connector housing (5;9) so as 
to pinch and thereby secure a said cable within the 

connector. 
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said cable supporting portion (34;82) of said 

cable supporting means (3;8) is resilient. 
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said cable supporting portion (34;82) of said
