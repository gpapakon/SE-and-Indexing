<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVINGSIDELOBE PERFORMANCE OF SPARSEARRAY USING HARMONIC IMAGINGFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention generally relates to ultrasound imaging of the human anatomy for the purpose of medical diagnosis. In particular, the invention relates to methods for reducing the beam sidelobes and grating lobes of a sparse transducer array.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONConventional ultrasound scanners create two-dimensional B-mode images of tissue in which the brightness of a pixel is based on the intensity of the echo return. Alternatively, in a color flow imaging mode, the movement of fluid(e.g., blood) or tissue can be imaged. Measurement of blood flow in the heart and vessels using the Doppler effect is well known. The frequency shift of backscattered ultrasound waves may be used to measure the velocity of the backscatterers from tissue or blood. The Doppler shift may be displayed using different colors to represent speed and direction of flow. In power Doppler imaging, the power contained in the returned Doppler signal is displayed. Conventional ultrasound transducers transmit a broadband signal centered at a fundamental frequency /0, which is applied separately to each transducer element making up the transmit aperture by a respective pulser. The pulsers are activated with time delays that produce the desired focusing of the transmit beam at a particular transmit focal position. As the transmit beam propagates through tissue, echoes are created when the ultrasound wave is scattered or reflected off of the boundaries between regions of different density. 

The transducer array is used to transduce these ultrasound echoes into electrical signals, which are processed to produce an image of the tissue. These ultrasound images are formed from a combination of fundamental and (sub)- harmonic signal components, the latter of which are generated in a nonlinear medium such as tissue or a blood stream containing contrast agents.In certain instances ultrasound images may be improved by suppressing the fundamental and emphasizing the (sub)harmonic (nonlinear) signal components. If the transmitted center frequency is at f0, then tissue/contrast nonlinearities will generate harmonics at kf , where k is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Also, subharmonics at frequencies f l may be generated by contrast bubble destruction. Imaging of (sub)harmonic signals has been performed by transmitting a narrowband signal at frequency /0 and receiving at a band centered at frequency 2/0 (second harmonic) or
