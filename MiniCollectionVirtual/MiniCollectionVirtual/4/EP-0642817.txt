<ABSTRACT>
A settling unit for separating a liquid and the particles, such 
as sand, suspended therein, comprises a basin with an inlet for the 

liquid mixture containing the particles, and an overflow for discharging 
the liquid after at least some of the particles have been removed 

therefrom through settling. With a view to increasing the efficiency, a 
plate separator is provided at the position of the overflow, which plate 

separator has a liquid outlet which is connected to the overflow and an 
outlet for settled particles which is connected to the basin. The gaps 

defined between the plates can be shut off at their underside by a non-return 
valve which can be moved into an open position under the influence 

of the weight of the separated particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a settling unit for separating a 
liquid, such as water, from the particles, such as sand, suspended 
therein, comprising a basin with an inlet for the liquid mixture 
containing the particles, and an overflow for discharging the liquid 
after at least some of the particles have been removed therefrom through 
settling. Such units are generally known. They are found in, for example, 
water-treatment plants; and such units are also found in the hopper in 
testing installations of dredgers such as hopper dredgers. The purpose of such units is to remove the largest possible 
quantity of the solid particles. However, it is found in practice that a 
certain quantity of particles unavoidably still leaves the unit with the 
liquid through the overflow. The overflow losses during dredging of sand with a hopper 
dredger, for example, are a known phenomenon. These overflow losses 
increase as the settling rate of the particles decreases, due to the fact 
that, for example, the average granule diameter of the particles becomes 
smaller or the viscosity of the liquid increases, or due to high 
turbulence. Such phenomena are undesirable. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a device of 
the abovementioned type which does not have these disadvantages. This 
object is achieved through the fact that a plate separator is provided at 
the position of the overflow, which plate separator has a liquid outlet 
which is connected to the overflow and an outlet for settled particles 
which is connected to the basin. The particles which have not had the chance to settle in the 
basin can still be separated in the plate separator and fed to the basin. 
The result is that the efficiency of the whole unit increases. In the 
region of the basin below the plate separator, which is screened off from 
the overflow by the latter, relatively weak flows prevail, so that the 
material fed by the plate separator to the basin can settle without being 
disturbed. The plate separator is situated upstream of the overflow, 
viewed in the direction of flow, the plates of the separator running 
essentially parallel to the direction of flow. The particles in this case 
can settle at right angles to the direction of flow (cross-flow). The plates of the separator are disposed parallel to each other  
 
at an angle, and can also be provided at their downward-facing side with 
downward-directed ribs extending to some distance from the adjacent 
plate. An important condition for good functioning of the plate 
separ

separator is provided at the position of the overflow, which plate 

separator has a liquid outlet which is connected to the overflow and an 
outlet for settled particles which is connected to the basin. 
Unit according to Claim 1, in which the plate separator is 
situated upstream of the overflow, viewed in the direction of flow, and 

the plates of the separator run essentially parallel to the direction of 
flow. 
Unit according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the plates of the 
separator are disposed parallel to each other at an angle, and are also 

provided at their downward-facing side with downward-directed ribs 
extending to some distance from the adjacent plate. 
Unit according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which the gaps defined 
between the plates are shut off at their underside by a non-return valve 

which can be moved into an open position under the influence of the 
weight of the separated particles. 
Unit according to claim 4, in which a horizontal separation 
wall is provided beneath the plates, which separation wall has at least 

one discharge. 
Unit according to Claim 5, in which beneath the separation wall 
and/or the gaps in each case there is a funnel, which funnel bears a non-return 

valve at its narrowed end. 
Unit according to Claim 4, in which each gap is provided with 
its own non-return valve at its underside. 
Unit according to Claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, in which the non-return 
valve comprises one or more flexible flaps which are held shut under pre-tension, 

produced by spring force, their own weight and/or liquid 
pressure difference, combined with the forces exerted on the valve by the 

tightly packed layer of settled particles present on top of the valve, in 
such a way that no flows occur in upward directions. 
Unit according to Claims 4 and 8 or 6 and 8, in which each non-return 
valve comprises two rubber flaps which are held against each other 

under pre-tension. 
Unit according to Claims 7 and 8, in which each non-return 
valve comprises a single rubber flap which is fixed by its top side to a 

plate in each case and rests with its bottom side under pre-tension 
against an adjacent plate. 
Unit according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
slant of the plates is adjustable. 
Hopper dredger or hopper vessel having as the hopper a unit 
according to one of the preceding claims. 
Hopper dredger or hopper vessel according to Claim 12, in which 
at least one overflow with plate separator is provided on the hopper. 
Hopper dredger or hopper vessel according to claim 13, in which 
each plate separator is bounded by an end wall, the top edge of which end 

wall being at a lower level than the top edge of each plate, thus forming 
the overflow. 
Hopper dredger or hopper vessel according to claim 14, in which 
the end wall has at least one opening, the lower boundary of which 

opening forming the overflow.
