<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns precisely meterable moulded bodies, for instance granules or pellets, containing hydrophilic macromolecules, active substances and, optionally, other pharmaceutically acceptable structure-forming agents and auxiliaries, the active substance being dissolved in, suspended in or emulsified with a matrix. The invention also concerns a method for producing such moulded bodies, the method being particularly cost-effective and environmentally acceptable, and the use of the moulded bodies as drugs in which bio-availability, storability and compatability are increased. In addition, the moulded bodies described, or mixtures of them, are also useful in preparing intermediates or end-products for use in pharmaceutics, cosmetics, diagnosis, analysis or dietary health care.
