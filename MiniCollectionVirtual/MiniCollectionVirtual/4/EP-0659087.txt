<ABSTRACT>
Combinations of IPN type molecular or intramolecular materials, which are thermoadhesive at temperatures not exceeding 90  C and which can be moulded and shaped at said temperature, are characterized in that they contain a first rubber-like elastoviscous constituent having a softening point not exceeding 90  C and a second, semi-cristalline constituent essentially of the polyester type having a fusion temperature of 35 to 80  C. These combinations have controlled adhesiveness and adequate fluidity for application by hand  particularly in do it yourself applications, orthopedics, sport and physiotherapy, and as an adhesive material on rough or porous bodies.

A molecular or intramolecular combination of materials 
of the general IPN form, wherein one of the constituents is 

synthesised in the presence of the other, and comprising a 
first polymer constituent which is amorphous in the 

temperature domain above 40°C and having in said 
combination, an elastoviscous to rubbery behaviour at a 

temperature under 80°C and a second semi-crystalline 
constituent comprising 80 per cent at least of the 

recurring unit of one or several polyesters having an 

average crystalline melting temperature comprised between 
35°C and 80°C, characterized in that the first constituent 

is either selected among the polymers or copolymers 
comprising vinyl acrylate, or methacrylate moieties or 

their mixtures and form with the second constituent a blend 
of macromolecules eventually grafted one to each other, or 

selected among the group of polyethers, polyesters, 
polyurethanes or their mixtures and form with the second 

constituent an intramolecular combination of distinct 
macromer segments. 
A combination according to claim 1, wherein the two 
noncrosslinked constituents are partially or totally 

miscible in a morphology of a thermoplastic semi-IPN. 
A combination according to claim 1, wherein the first 
constituent partially or totally crosslinked and distinct 

from the second forms with the second noncrosslinked 
constituent a dispersion partially or totally miscible in a 

morphology of a thermoplastic IPN. 
A combination according to claim 1, wherein the first 
constituent partially or totally crosslinked and distinct 

from the second, forms with the second partially 
crosslinked constituent a partially or totally miscible 

dispersion in a morphology of an elastomer IPN when the 
second constituent is in the melt state. 
A process for producing the combination described in 
claim 2, characterized in that the second noncrosslinked 

and noncrosslinkable constituent is dissolved in the 
mixture of monofunctional monomers of the first constituent

brought to polymerize by any means of polymerization in 
bulk, in solution or after such preparation has been placed 

in contact with a textile substrate. 
A process for producing the combination described in 
claim 3, characterized in that the second noncrosslinked 

and noncrosslinkable constituent is dissolved in the 
mixture of monomers of the first constituent comprising a 

small amount not exceeding 5 percent of multifunctional 
monomers with or without the aid of a solvent, said 

monomers are brought to polymerize in bulk or in solution 
or after the preparation has been placed in contact with a 

textile substrate. 
A process for producing the combination described in 
claim 4, characterized in that the second partially 

crosslinkable constituent is dissolved in the mixture of 
monomers of the first constituent comprising a small amount 

not exceeding 5 percent of multifunctional moieties with or 
without the aid of a solvent said monomers being brought to 

polymerize by any means of polymerization and said second 
constituent being caused to crosslink partially. 
A process for producing the combination described in 
claim 1, wherein the second constituent is synthesised in 

the presence of the first one or of the means to obtain the 
first one, with or without the aid of a solvent, by 

reaction a of mixture of polyisocyanates and polyols, said 
polyols containing an amount of at least 80 per cent of 

semi-crystalline polyester macromer segments having an 
individual average molecular weight of at least 2500 and 

said polyols having an average functionality not exceeding

A process for producing the combination described in 
claim 1, wherein the second constituent is synthesised in 

the presence of the first one or of the means to obtain the 
first one, with or without the aid of a solvent, by 

reaction of a mixture of polyisocyanates and polyols, said 
polyols containing an amount of at least 80 per cent of 

semi-crystalline polyester macromer segments having an  
 

individual average molecular weight of at least 2500 and

which the water is brought to evaporate and on which the 
polymerization is carried on to completion.
