outlet port (31) for a second fluid, and a bundle of hollow fibers (32) 
located within the outer casing (22) and being in flow communication 

with the inlet (29) and outlet (31) port for the second fluid. A central

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to hollow fibre membrane 
exchanger. While the invention is subject to a wide range 
of applications, it is especially suited for use in 
oxygenating blood and will be particularly described in 
that connection. During open heart surgery, natural cardiovascular 
activity is suspended, which causes the lungs to collapse. 
It is therefore necessary to simulate the function of the 
lungs, which replaces carbon dioxide in the blood with 
oxygen. Blood oxygenators serve this function. A typical 
hollow fibre blood oxygenator includes a bundle of hollow 
fibres extending through a blood chamber for conveying 
oxygen into the blood chamber and for removing carbon 
dioxide from the blood therein. Specifically, the fibres 
are constructed of a membrane material that acts as a 
boundary between extracorporeal blood flow and oxygen flow. 
As blood flows on the outside of the fibres and oxygen 
passes through the hollow fibres, a gas exchange occurs 
wherein oxygen passes through the fibre walls and into the 
blood and carbon dioxide passes, in the opposite direction, 
from the blood into the interior of the hollow fibres.  
 There are multiple and sometimes conflicting parameters that 
must be considered when designing a hollow fiber membrane 
exchanger. For example, the longer blood remains in contact with 
the fibers, the greater the amount of gas exchange that may occur. 
Thus, it may be desirable to design the oxygenator so that the 
length of the flow path of the blood relative to the hollow fibers 
is maximized to thereby maximize contact between blood and the 
hollow fibers. On the other hand, it is desirable to construct an 
exchanger that is as small and compact as possible. Thus, the 
desire to build a compact unit is somewhat constrained by blood 
flow path length requirements. Biocompatibility is also a factor that must be considered in 
exchanger design. For example, membrane exchangers are typically 
manufactured from multiple components that are joined together 
with adhesives. However, in order to minimize the possibility of 
bioincompatibility between the blood and the materials that make 
up the exchanger, it is preferable to minimize the number of 
materials with which extracorporeal circulating blood comes into 
contact. Thus, while adhesives may be necessary, it is beneficial 
to limit the amount of adhesive that is located in the blood flow 
path. Finally, gas exchange requirements, which are often dependent 
upon a particular use, also place constraints on the ultimate
