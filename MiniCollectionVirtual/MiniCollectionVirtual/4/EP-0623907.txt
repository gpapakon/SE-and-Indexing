<ABSTRACT>
A slide rule (1) for music theory for the visual display of the sequence of notes of scales and/or chords in the various keys of a sound system, consisting of an elongate basic body (2) which is provided with fixed scales (7, 8; 9, 10) which have the sounds of the sound system arranged with uniform spacing, and exchangeable sliders (11, 13, 14) which are guided axially displaceably in the basic body (2) and have scales (7, 8; 9, 10) provided with the sequences of notes of the scales and the chords in a spacing corresponding to the spacing of the fixed scales (7, 8; 9, 10), is made more user-friendly if the slider (11, 13, 14) is arranged in the basic body (2) in an on-edge position.
