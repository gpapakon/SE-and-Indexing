<ABSTRACT>
Single-stage liquid-ring gas pump that can be flanged to a drive unit. The inlet and discharge connections are provided on a connection housing (3) which is intended for connection to the drive unit. Provided on that side of the connection housing which is remote from the drive are a control plate (4) and a working-space housing (5) with an impeller (14) revolving therein. The said impeller interacts in a sealing manner on its open side with the control plate and on its largely closed side (19) with an end wall (7) of the working-space housing (5). The working-space housing is designed as a deep-drawn sheet-metal part and has no medium connections. For connection with the connection housing or the control plate, it is provided with a radial connecting flange (6). The transition from the cylindrical part to the connecting flange (6) of the working-space housing (5) is rounded in such a way on the inside that the gap remaining between this rounding and the control plate remains below a certain size. Its incircle should not be larger than 3.5% of the impeller diameter.

A single-stage liquid ring gas pump which can be 
flange-mounted on a drive unit, with a connecting housing 

(3) forming the suction and delivery connections, a control 
disc (4), a working chamber housing (5) which for connection 

with the control plate has a substantially flat connecting 
flange (6), and with a rotating impeller (13) mounted 

overhung in the working chamber housing, characterised in 
that the working chamber housing (5) is in the form of a 

deep-drawn sheet part, and in that the transition (11) on 
the inside from the substantially cylindrical part of the 

working chamber housing (5) into the connecting flange (6) 
is rounded, and the diameter of the inscribed circle (23), 

which diameter can be inscribed within the surfaces of the 
longitudinal gusset section (21) between the rounded portion 

(11), the control plate (4) and the alignment extension (22) 
of the working chamber boundary, which is parallel to the 

impeller rim, is not greater than 1.5 times the wall 
thickness of the working chamber housing. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that alternatively the diameter of the 

inscribed circle (23) is not greater than 3.5 % of the 
impeller diameter. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a dirt-discharge opening (24) is 

disposed in the control plate (4) so that it at least 
adjoins the gap (21) between the control plate (4) and the 

rounded portion (11) at the transition of the cylindrical 
part into the flange (6) of the working chamber housing (5), 

and it is situated preferably wholly or partly radially 
outside the inner diameter of the cylindrical part of the 

working chamber housing.  
 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the vane (14) of the 

impeller (13) is formed without projections at the 
transition of the cylindrical part into the flange (6) of 

the working chamber housing (5).
