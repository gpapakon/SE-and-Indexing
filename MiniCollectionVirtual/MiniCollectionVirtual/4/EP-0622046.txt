<ABSTRACT>
A blood sampler of the suction-type is provided with
a gasket, a lancet unit and a plunger slidable in a housing

having an open front and an open rear end. A rod is
connected at its front end to the lancet unit. The rod

extends rearwardly over a detent integral with the inner
periphery of the housing, through a central opening of the

gasket and into an axial bore of the plunger. A flange,
secured to the rear end of the rod is slidable within the

axial bore, the gasket is slidable within the housing and
behind the detent, and a protrusion formed integral with an

intermediate portion of the rod is engageable with the
detent. The blood sampler further has a first spring

intervening between the detent and the lancet unit, and a
second spring accommodated in the bore and intervening

between the flange and the front end of the plunger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suction-type blood
sampler useful for sampling from a human skin a
predetermined quantity of blood for various blood tests, by
thrusting a sting or needle into the human skin, wherein a
vacuum of a certain degree is applied thereto to suck the
blood sample into the device.Generally, so-called lancet injectors comprise a blade and
a pressable end opposed thereto, with the blade having an
acute end capable of being thrust into the skin of a human.
By gently striking the pressable portion, the acute end of
the blade will pierce the skin, for example, that of his or
her finger. A small amount of blood for the blood test will
ooze out of the skin, and will be taken into a container by
using a pipette or capillary. There are many small blood
vessels in each finger so that a finger can be pressed to
cause a small drop of blood to ooze. Since fingers are more
sensitive to pain, it is a recent tendency that the upper
arm, abdomen or thigh is subjected to the blood sampling.Similar devices are used in the latter case, too, and an
example thereof is disclosed in DD-A-260 864, which
discloses a housing; a lancet unit positioned in a front
region of the housing; a rod extending in a direction away
from the lancet unit; a plunger provided in a rear region
of the housing, said rod connected to said plunger; said
housing having an open frontal end and an open rearward
end; said lancet unit including a lancet body fixed to a
lancet retainer, said lancet body having a needle extending
forwardly therefrom; a first spring, a second spring and a 
third spring provided in the housing between the lancet
unit and the plunger, wherein said first spring urges said
lancet unit forward to move said needle outwardly of said
housing, and said second spring urges said lancet unit to
be retracted behind said frontal end.Furthermore, EP-A-0 166 574 discloses a device for piercing
the human skin and for collecting blood by suction of a
plunger, wherein the plunger has a gasket attached to the
forward end of the plunger; and a lancet retainer being in
sliding contact with an inner peripheral surface of the
housing; and wherein a spring controls reduction of air
pressure in the housing, in response to movement of the
plunger.Moreover, documents EP-A-0 109 970 and US-A-4 373 535
disclose blood sampling units for sampling blood to perform
a blood gas analysis:EP-A-0 109 970 discloses a blood sampling unit which
comprises a barrel member which consists of a calibrated
tubular syringe body reduced at one end

<CLAIMS>
A suction-type blood sampler comprising:

a housing (1) having an open frontal end and an open
rearward end;
a lancet unit (6) positioned in a front region of the
housing (1);
a rod (3) extending rearwardly from the lancet
unit (6);
a plunger (2) provided with a gasket (7) attached to a
forward end of the plunger (2);
said gasket (7) permitting to escape the air in the housing
interior (10) or to enter the air into the housing interior

(10) when the plunger (2) moves forward, and permitting to
reduce the air pressure in the housing interior (10) when

the plunger moves backward;
said rod (3) contacting slidably said plunger (2);
said lancet unit (6) including a lancet body (18) fixed to
a lancet retainer (11),
said lancet body (18) having a needle (16) extending
forwardly therefrom;
said lancet retainer (16) being in sliding contact with an
inner peripheral surface of the housing (1); 
said housing (1) having provided therein between the lancet
unit (6) and the plunger:


a first spring (8) thrusting the needle (16) into the human
skin by pressing said plunger (2) forward to stretch said

first spring (8) continuously to urge said lancet unit (6)
forward and to move said needle (16) outwardly;
a third spring (9) controlling reduction of air pressure in
the interior of the housing (10) to suck out blood by

removing one's finger from said plunger (2) manually to
stretch said third spring (9) automatically and to return

said plunger (2) rearward; said housing having provided therein
a second spring (20) between the lancet unit (6) and the plunger, or inside the plunger urging said lancet unit (6) to be
retracted behind said frontal end while maintaining to

press said plunger (2) by stretching said second spring
(20) to pull a flange (5) and the rod (3) rearward.
