<ABSTRACT>
An electronic ballast is provided with a built-in timed 
electric power saver and with photoelectric switching for high-pressure 

mercury vapor, metallic vapor and sodium vapor lamps. 
The electronic ballast with the built-in timed saver and photo-electric 

switching for high-pressure mercury vapor, metallic 
vapor and sodium lamps includes an electronic circuit having as 

a principle the obtaining of an increase in the frequency of the 
electric power distribution network. This increase is accomplished 

by means of a switching that results in a current 
limiting electronic device, which also is able to incorporate a 

timed electric power saver, the utilization of a single equipment 
for various lamp lower ratings, a photo-sensitive element for 

control of the lamp switching in accordance with the lighting 
level of the installation site and an ignitor for lamps requiring 

a voltage higher than the rated one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an equipment employed for 
lighting in general, more specifically to a ballast, made with 
electronic components employed for use in connection with the 
operation of high-pressure mercury vapor, metallic vapor and 
sodium vapor type lamps. The current conventional prior art ballasts employed on the 
aforementioned high pressure mercury vapor, metallic vapor and 
sodium vapor lamps are of the inductive electric type, the 
disadvantage of which is a heavy high weight by reason of their 
construction and system. One of the objects of the present invention is to reduce the 
weight thereof in relation to the weight of conventional prior 
art ballasts. In addition to the application as a current limiter for high 
pressure mercury vapor, metallic multiple vapors and sodium 
discharge lamps, the technology of the present invention allows 
for the utilization of the ballast as a timed electric power 
saver, the utilization of a single type of equipment for various 
lamp ratings and, by incorporation of a photo-sensitive element 
and lamp switching, the control according to the lighting level 
of the installation site. Another advantage arising from the utilization of the 
electronic device of the present invention is that it does not 
require the use of capacitors to correct the power factor, due 
to the low inductance inherent to the circuit. In the case of 
lamps requiring ignition at a voltage exceeding the rated one, 
such as those employing metallic multivapors and sodium, the 
electronic ballast of the present invention contains the ignitor 
incorporated within and to the circuit thereof.  The present invention therefore includes an electronic 
ballast with a built in timed saver and photo-electric switching 
for high pressure mercury vapor, metallic vapor and sodium lamps. 
The ballast includes an electronic circuit for obtaining an 
increase in the frequency of an electric power distribution 
network, by means of a switching that results in a current 
limiting electronic device. The ballast is also able to incorporate 
a timed electric power saver, the utilization of a single 
equipment ballast for various lamp power ratings, a photosensitive 
element for control of the lamp switching in accordance 
with the lighting level of a particular installation site and an 
ignitor for lamps requiring a voltage higher than the rated one.  The objectives, advantages and other important features may 
be more easily understood when read jointly with the appended 
drawing, wherein:
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electronic ballast for high-pressure mercury vapor, 
metallic vapor and sodium vapor lamps, comprising an electronic 

circuit for producing and obtaining a frequency higher than a 
frequency associated with that of an electric power distribution 

network, wherein said frequency is 50 Hz or 60 Hz or higher than 
the frequency associated with that of an electric power distribution 

network, said ballast further including a current-limiting 
electronic device which said current-limiting electronic device, 

to perform electronic switching, employs an oscillator powered 
by the electric power network, the purpose of which said 

oscillator being to switch the power transistors, wherein the 
resulting square switched waveform requires a low inductance for 

current limitation, contrary to the conventional ballasts which 
employ high inductance and low frequency, and said ballast having 

a smaller mass, weight and dimension than that of conventional 
ballasts. 
The electronic ballast for high-pressure mercury vapor, 
metallic vapor and sodium vapor lamps, as in Claim 1, wherein the 

lamps utilize said ballast as a timed electric power saver, said 
ballast being an interchangeable single equipment for utilization 

with lamps of various power ratings, said ballast incorporating 
therewith a photo-sensitive element, said ballast controlling 

lamp switching in accordance with a lighting level of an installation 
site, said ballast further containing an ignitor incorporated 

to the circuit for lamps that require ignition at a voltage 
higher than the rated voltage.
