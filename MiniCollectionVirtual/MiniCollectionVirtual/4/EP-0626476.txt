<ABSTRACT>
A control system for tuck-in selvedge forming devices in a loom, 
in which the drive shaft (12) for operating all said tuck-in selvedge 

forming devices (9,10) is rigid with a coupling unit (25) which during 
the 

pauses of a modulator output shaft (24) can be coupled, under the 
control of a logic unit (26) connected to said coupling unit (25), to 

said 
output shaft (24) of the modulator (20), which is operated by the loom 

main 
shaft (14); a preferred embodiment is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new control system for tuck-in 
selvedge forming devices in a loom, in particular a loom for terry 
cloth formed by varying the reed beat-up position which, by 
enabling a single command to automatically prevent the cut warp 
ends from being tucked into the shed for a predetermined number of 
reed beat-ups with the loom in operation, achieved by locking in 
their rest position the tuck-in members of all said tuck-in 
selvedge forming devices or selvedge formers of the loom, 
independently of the type of selvedge former used and hence also 
enabling positively controlled conjugate-cam selvedge formers to 
be used, enables the higher operating speeds currently required of 
modern terry looms to be achieved, together with considerable 
mechanical simplification of the loom. From the state of the art, various systems are already known for 
controlling the members of selvedge formers for terry looms of the 
type using different reed beat-up positions. In said known selvedge formers, the members for tucking the cut 
weft ends into the shed at each reed beat-up or after a  
 
predetermined number of reed beat-ups generally consist, for each 
selvedge former, of a weft tuck-in hook and a movable member or 
foot for weft gripping and cutting, both undergoing rotation and 
translation or axial movement. According to FR-A-2 538 417, said technical solution is utilized in an apparatus for forming tucked selvedge on a terry loom fabric with two beat-up positions where the grasping and cutting means as well as the weft introducting means are independently driven by different cams in cooperation with a plurality of spring-based levers. Said levers are provided with teeth cooperating with stop abutments so as to render the grasping and cutting means inactive. Said movements of the hook or foot are achieved independently of 
each other by separate operating cams which are keyed onto a 
single drive shaft rotated continuously by the main loom shaft and 
move corresponding spring-loaded operating levers pivoted at one 
end onto a single shaft. The controlled prevention of tuck-in of the cut weft ends into the 
shed for a predetermined number of reed beat-ups is achieved by a 
system which locks both the rotation of the hook and the rotation 
and translation of the foot substantially by a movement selection 
mechanism present on each selvedge former, in which appendices or 
teeth projecting from said operating levers cooperate with 
corresponding stops mounted on a spring-loaded support shaft

<CLAIMS>
A control system for tuck-in selvedge forming devices (9,10) in a 
loom, in particular a loom for terry cloth formed by varying the 

reed beat-up position, comprising a main shaft (14), a drive shaft (12) 
for operating all said tuck-in selvedge forming devices (9,10), a modulator (20) which is driven by the main shaft (14), which modulator has an output shaft (24), which rotates with intermittent pauses, at least one pause at each revolution of the main shaft (14), characterised by a coupling unit (25) to control the coupling between modulator output shaft (24) and tucker drive shaft (12), whereby said 

coupling unit (25) consists of a ring (27) rigid with said drive shaft (12) and 
carrying pivoted thereto a first lever (28) loaded by a spring (32) in the 

sense of inserting a key (30) rigid with the lever (28) into a corresponding 
recess (33) provided in said modulator output shaft (24), this recess (33) always 

being presented in front of said key (30) during the intermittent pauses of said 
output shaft (24), said first lever (28) cooperating with a second lever (34) 

which, pivoted on the fixed casing of the system and loaded by a 
spring (36) to follow the contour of a control cam (38) driven by said loom 

main shaft (14), tends to rotate said first lever (28) in the sense of 
withdrawing said key (30) from said recess (33) and correspondingly 

inserting a second key (31) of said first lever (28) into a second fixed 
recess (37), a ferromagnetic plate (41) rigid with said second lever (34) 

cooperating with a logic unit (26), consisting of a fixed 
electromagnet (42), to exclude cooperation between said first and 

second lever, said logic unit (26) being connected to said coupling unit (25) to 
control whether the coupling is effected or not.
