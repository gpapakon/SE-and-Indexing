<ABSTRACT>
A method for programming a two-level polysilicon EEPROM 
memory cell, which cell is implemented in MOS technology on 

a semiconductor substrate (2) and comprises a floating gate 
(12) transistor and a further control gate (15) overlying 

the floating gate (12) with a dielectric layer (11) 
therebetween, provides for the application of a negative 

voltage to the control gate (15) during the cell (1) write 
phase. This enables the voltages being applied across the 

thin tunnel oxide layer to be distributed so as to reduce 
the maximum amount of energy of the "holes" and improve the 

oxide reliability. In addition, by controlling the rise 
speed of the impulse to the drain region during the write 

phase, and of the impulse to the control gate during the 
erase phase, the maximum current flowing through the tunnel 

oxide can be set and the electric field being applied to 
the tunnel oxide kept constant, thereby the device life 

span can be extended.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for programming a two-level
polysilicon EEPROM memory cell, said cell being
implemented in MOS technology on a semiconductor substrate
with a floating gate transistor overlying a thin tunnel
oxide layer and having a further control gate overlying the
floating gate, with a dielectric layer therebetween, and
being connected serially to a selection transistor, said
cell including active regions formed by a double implant
realized with two different concentrations of the same
conductivity type.As is well known, EEPROM memory structures, while being of
the non-volatile type, allow the information stored therein
to be altered electrically both during the write and the
erase phases.In essence, EEPROMs can have the state of any memory cells
altered by tunnelling electrons through a thin layer of
silicon oxide.The thin oxide region has a smaller area than the so-called
floating gate whereinto the electric charge is stored.Memory cells with the above-outlined construction are
referred to as FLOTOX, and are described, for example, in
an article entitled "Oxide reliability criterion for the
evaluation of endurance performance of electrically
erasable programmable read-only memories", Journal App.
Phys. 71, No. 9, 1992. This kind of EEPROM memories falls into two general
classes: a first class provided with a single level of
polysilicon, and a second class having two discrete levels
of polysilicon.Memories of the first class have an advantage in that they
can be manufactured by a comparatively simple process; but
the overall circuit space requirements are much higher,
usually by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5.This penalizes memories with a single level of polysilicon
in all those applications which require high circuit
density, e.g. in excess of one Megabit.It should be noted here that memories of either classes,
whether with one or two levels of polysilicon, use positive
voltages for both writing and erasing purposes. These
voltages range from 8 to 12 Volts in order to generate a
sufficiently strong electric field across the thin oxide to
effectively trigger the tunnel effect.However, the use of these relatively high positive voltages
may eventually result in the thin oxide layer becoming
deteriorated.A first prior art solution to realize a two-level
polysilicon EEPROM memory cell is disclosed in the U.S.
patent No. Us-A-5,081,054 which discloses a floating gate
transistor connected serially to a selection transistor and
provided with a further control gate overlying the floating
gate. An

wherein a negative voltage is applied to said control gate
(15) during the cell (1) write phase, while a positive

voltage is applied to one (28) of said active regions so
that the voltage applied accross the thin tunnel oxide

layer is distributed.
