<ABSTRACT>
2.1 It is known, by arrangement of a roof covering and a rear spoiler element, adjoining the rear of the covering, over a rear roof-panel region of a vehicle with a box body, such as, for example, a bus, to form an air-guiding duct which leads from the rear roof region to the upper rear region and through which air can be passed from the roof region to the rear region in order, at that point, to make it possible for the rear window to be kept free of dirt. Due to roof-extension elements, such as roof hatches or air-scoops for a roof heating system, in modern buses the air-flow pattern in the rear roof region is disturbed and hence the intensity of the air diverted to the rear reduced. 2.2 In the case of the novel, rear-side vehicle roof region (1), in the rear half of the upper side of the roof covering (6) there is provided at least one NACA-inlet (7) through which an additional portion (8') of the air flow, which otherwise flows away over the roof covering, is drawn into the region of the air-guiding duct (12) and, as a result, a vigorous flow of air is directed into the region behind the rear window (3) ensuring that it is adequately kept free of dirt. 2.3 Use, for example in the construction of buses.

<CLAIMS>
Roof area over the rear of a vehicle, particularly of a bus, with 

a rear roof plate area (5) comprising at least one roof superstructure element (2) 
and a curved rear end member (10) adjacent the top edge (11) of a rear window 

(3), 
a rear spoiler element (4), the inside of which (13) extends above and behind the 
curved rear roof end plate, forming an air duct (12) between the two, and 
a roof covering (6) constructed to be open at the front and closed at the sides 
which covers the rear roof plate area with the at least one roof superstructure 

element with which, at the rear, the rear spoiler element is substantially flush at its 
top, 
 
characterised in that 


in the rear half of the top of the roof covering (6) there is at least one NACA inlet 
(7) which t the rear ends with at most a minimal distance in front of the front edge 

of the rear spoiler element (4). 
A rear roof area of a vehicle in accordance with claim 1, further characterised in that 

a plurality of NACA inlets (7) are arranged in a row extending crosswise to the 
longitudinal direction of the vehicle and are situated beside one another at 

substantially equal intervals while at the rear they are situated at not more than a 
very small distance in front of the front edge of the rear spoiler element (4) and 

end at the top of the roof covering (6).
