<ABSTRACT>
In a rotary lapping and polishing head (110, 210), of the type 
comprising grinding segments (32) operating tangentially and oscillating 

about axes arranged radially with respect to the axis of rotation of the 
said head (110, 210), the head being used for the processing of slabs or 

panels consisting of hard stone, such as granites and similar ceramic 
materials, use is made of means capable of compensating the variation in 

the mutual position of the grinding segments (32) so as to reduce 
imbalances associated with centrifugal forces applied to the said 

grinding segments (32) as a result of the variation in their mutual 
position. For a first partial compensation, use is made of an equal 

number of grinding segments (32) moved in pairs in mutually opposite 
directions, while for a second substantially total compensation use is 

made of grinding elements (32) moved in threes also in mutually opposite 
directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lapping and
polishing head for slabs and panels of granite and similar ceramic
materials of the type described in Italian Patent No. 1,175,191
in the name of Marcello
TONCELLI and in DE-A-3408443.The lapping head described in the aforementioned patent is of the
type comprising a certain number of oscillating grinding segments (six in
the preferred example of embodiment) rotating together with the head
about a central shaft of the latter and made to oscillate by a mechanism
formed by an inclined disc rotating at a speed varying by a few per cent
with respect to that of the said head and connected to crank mechanisms
ensuring oscillation of the said segments of the head. The operating
principle of said head is illustrated, for the sake of clarity, in
Figures 1 to 3 of the drawings accompanying the present patent
application.The idea of having grinding segments oscillating about axes
arranged radially on a lapping and polishing head dates back several
years, as can be seen from the vast literature on the subject, starting
from US Patent No. 2,105,634 granted on 18 January 1938, continuing with
German Patent No. 800,112 filed on 15 July 1949, German Patent No.
2,105,385 filed on 1 April 1970 and the published application of German
Patent No. 2,607,804 filed on 26 February 1973, up to at least the
aforementioned Italian Patent in the name of Marcello Toncelli. In
particular, in the aforementioned German patents and applications the
said grinding segments are made to oscillate by a cam mounted coaxially
with respect to the lapping head and moved at a speed varying by a few
per cent with respect to that of the said head.The grinding segments which are made to oscillate, both by a cam
according to the aforementioned German patents and patent applications,
and by the inclined rotating disc mechanism illustrated in the
aforementioned Italian patent of Marcello Toncelli, perform a complete
angular oscillation, over an amplitude of the order of a few tens of
degrees for about every ten revolutions of the said head. It can be understood that, since the grinding segments move
forwards and backwards with respect to a central oscillation axis of
theirs, at certain moments the oscillating velocity is added to the
rotational velocity of the grinding elements, while at certain other
moments the same oscillating velocity is subtracted from the rotational
velocity; furthermore, since the oscillating movement is derived from
different positions on the circumference of the inclined disc,

<CLAIMS>
Rotary polishing and lapping head for granites and similar stones,
comprising an inclined disc (146, 246) turning about a rotation axis (48) of the

head, a plurality of oscillating lugs (134a-134f; 234a-234f) arranged
circumferentially around the disc, provided with grinding segments and rotatable

about respective radial directions with reference to the axis of the head, a
plurality of spindles (142b, 142d, 142f; 242c, 242f) protruding outward from

the periphery of the inclined disc, extending between two adjacent lugs and
connected to one of them so as to make it oscillate following to the rotation of

the inclined disc, characterised in that:

between two consecutive spindles there are arranged at least two lugs;
each oscillating lug is provided with a respective toothed member (140,
240; 180, 280; 260) and the toothed members of lugs located between two

consecutive spindles, mesh each other thereby counter-rotating their respective
lugs;
each spindle is fitted to the toothed member of the adjacent lug to which it
is connected, so that the latter oscillates following to the operation of such

toothed member when the inclined disc rotates, whereas the other lugs arranged
between the consecutive spindles are counter-rotated by the toothed members

meshing each other, so that the meshing toothed members do not form
a closed chain.
Rotary head according to claim 1, wherein there are three spindles (142b,
142d, 142f; 242c, 242f) which protrude at 120Â° from the inclined disc (146,

246) and wherein two oscillating lugs (134a-134f; 234a-234f) are arranged
between each pair of consecutive spindles.
Rotary head according to claim 1, wherein there are two spindles (142b,
142d, 142f; 242c, 242f) which protrude from opposite parts of the inclined disc

(146, 246) along a same diametral direction with reference to the axis (48) of
the head, and wherein the number of oscillating lugs (134a-134f; 234a-234f)

arranged between these spindles on each side with respect to the aforesaid
direction, is an odd number. 
Rotary head according to claim 3, wherein the odd number is three.
Rotary head according to claim 3, wherein the odd number is five.
Rotary head according to claim 3, wherein the odd number is seven.
