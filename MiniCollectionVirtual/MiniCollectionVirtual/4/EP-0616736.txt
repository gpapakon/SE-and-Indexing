<CLAIMS>
Pressure-compensation element (20) consisting of 
a body (38, 40) and a diaphragm (21), the body consisting 

of a carrier (38) with a plurality of stepped holes (39), 
and a plastic mass engaging in these holes (39), which 

mass also at least partially covers the diaphragm (21) in 
its edge region resting on the carrier (38). 
Terminal strip (11), in particular for an 
electric switching device, having a base body (10) which 

has a pressure-compensation element (20) according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that a plurality of plug-in 

connecting components (13, 14) are present in the base 
body (10), which components (13, 14) are led in a sealed 

fashion out of the base body (10) and are connected to 
electric components.

in that the pressure-compensation element (20) is 

arranged in a recess (19) formed in the inner wall of the 
base body (10). 
Terminal strip according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the pressure-compensation element (20) is 

arranged in the outside of the base body (10) of the 
terminal strip (11). 
Terminal strip according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the pressure-compensation element (20) is 

arranged in a recess formed in the locking part (16) of 
the terminal strip (11), and in that the space (26) in 

front of the pressure-compensation element (20) is 
connected to the interior of the housing (17). 
Terminal strip according to Claim 5,  
 

characterized in that a protective shutter (30) is 
arranged in front of the pressure-compensation element 

(20). 
Terminal strip according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that at least one maze-like hole (25) is 

formed in the base body (10) in front of the pressure-compensation 
element (20).
