<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic drive
system for hydraulic working machines, and more particularly
to a hydraulic drive system which is incorporated in
hydraulic working machines such as hydraulic excavators and
includes a directional control valve having a center bypass
passage.As described in JP, B, 47-3927 and JP, B, 50-5354, for
example, a prior art hydraulic drive system of the above-mentioned
type comprises a variable displacement hydraulic
pump, at least one actuator driven by a hydraulic fluid
delivered from the hydraulic pump, a directional control
valve of center bypass type, which has a meter-in passage
provided with a meter-in variable restrictor and a center
bypass passage provided with a bleed-off variable restrictor,
for controlling a flow of the hydraulic fluid supplied
from the hydraulic pump to the actuator, a low pressure
circuit, a center bypass line for connecting the center
bypass passage to the low pressure circuit at a location
downstream of the bleed-off variable restrictor, a pressure 
generator, e.g., fixed restrictor, disposed in the center
bypass line, and a pump regulator for controlling a displacement
of the hydraulic pump by using, as a control
pressure, the pressure generated by the fixed restrictor.The pump regulator carries out well-known negative
control in accordance with the control pressure generated
by the fixed restrictor. More specifically, the pump
regulator makes control such that the displacement of the
hydraulic pump is increased as the control pressure lowers
and the pump displacement is decreased as it rises.In the prior art thus constructed, when the directional
control valve is gradually stroked from its neutral
position with an intention of driving the actuator, an
opening area of the bleed-off variable restrictor of the
directional control valve is gradually reduced and, to the
contrary, an opening area of the meter-in variable restrictor
thereof is gradually increased.When the directional control valve is in its neutral
position or at a start point of its stroke, i.e., when the
bleed-off variable restrictor begins to close, the control
pressure generated by the fixed restrictor is high and the
hydraulic pump is kept at a predetermined small displacement
to deliver the hydraulic fluid at a standby flow rate
which is a small value corresponding to the above predetermined
small displacement. As the bleed-off variable restrictor
is gradually closed, a pressure of the hydraulic
fluid delivered from the hydraulic pump, i.e., a pump
pressure,
