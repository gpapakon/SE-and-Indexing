<ABSTRACT>
The 2α and 2β-hydroxy as well as the 
2α(3'-hydroxypropoxy)- and 2β(3'-hydroxypropoxy)- and 

2α(benzyloxy)- analogs of 19-nor-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ are 
disclosed. The two 2-hydroxy analogs showed in vivo calcium 

transport with little or no bone calcium mobilization; the 2β-more 
than the 2α- analog. Both analogs induced differentiation 

of malignant cells. The two analogs thus show promise in the 
treatment of osteoporosis. The 2α-hydroxypropoxy analog 

showed a selective activity profile, combining high potency in 
inducing differentiation of malignant cells with very low or no 

bone calcification activity, a possible use in the treatment of 

malignancies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biologically active vitamin D3 
compounds. More specifically, the invention relates to 19-nor-analogs 
of 1α-hydroxylated vitamin D3 compounds having a 
substituent at the 2-position in the A-ring. The 1α-hydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D -- most 
importantly 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 
1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 -- are known as highly potent 
regulators of calcium homeostasis in animals and humans, and 
more recently their activity in cellular differentiation has also 
been established. V. Ostrem et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
(1987), 84, 2610. As a consequence, many structural analogs of 
these metabolites, such as compounds with different side chain 
structures, different hydroxylation patterns, or different 
stereochemistry, have been prepared and tested. Important 
examples of such analogs are 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, 
1α-hydroxyvitamin D2, various side chain fluorinated derivatives 
of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and side chain homologated 
analogs. Several of these known compounds exhibit highly 
potent activity invivo or invitro, and some of these have been 
found to exhibit an interesting separation of activities in cell 
differentiation and calcium regulation. This difference in activity 
provides these compounds with advantageous therapeutic 
activity profiles and thus numerous of these compounds are in 
use, or have been proposed for use, in the treatment of a variety 
of diseases such as renal osteodystrophy, vitamin D-resistant 
rickets, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and certain malignancies. Recently, a new class of vitamin D analogs has been 
discovered, i.e. the so-called 19-nor-vitamin D compounds. 19-Nor-vitamin 
D compounds are vitamin D analogs in which the 
ring A exocyclic methylene group (carbon 19) typical of all 
vitamin D compounds has been removed and replaced by two 
hydrogen atoms. Specifically, these compounds exhibit a 
selective activity profile with high potency in inducing cellular  
 
differentiation, and minimal bone calcification activity. Such a 
differential activity profile renders these compounds useful for 
the treatment of malignancies, or the treatment of various skin 
disorders. Two different methods of synthesis of these 19-nor-vitamin 
D analogs have been described (Perlman et al. 
Tetrahedron Letters 31, 1823 (1990); Perlman et al 
Tetrahedron Letters 32, 7663 (1991), and DeLuca et al U.S. 
Patent 5,086,191). In U.S. Patent 4,666,634, 2β-hydroxy and alkoxy analogs 
of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 have been described and examined
