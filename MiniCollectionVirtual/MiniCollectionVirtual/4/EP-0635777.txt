<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a docking device which can improve stereo 
effect and tone quality, and which allows a portable computer to have the 

same functions as a desktop personal computer. Speakers are built into 
respective projecting portions 16, 18 projecting from the two sides along 

the width of a support portion 14 of a main body 20. This enables 
improvement of both of stereo effect and tone quality from a conventional 

case where speakers are incorporated in the main body facing the back. 
Furthermore, it becomes possible to accommodate in the main body 20 a 

full-size AT bus card which is difficult to accommodate conventionally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a docking device for a portable
computer and, more specifically, to that of a kind on which a portable
computer is placed and fixed, and which provides electrical connections
to the portable computer so as to extend its various functions.In conventional personal computers capable of accommodating stereo
sound, and in docking devices for computers, speakers are disposed in a
rear portion of a main body facing the back.There are conventional desktop-use docking devices (also called
"docking stations") for computers capable of incorporating a full-size
(larger than the A4 size) AT bus. (The AT bus is an extension bus, and
the full-size AT bus card is a circuit board on which the full-size AT
bus is formed.) Although there exist docking devices for computers
which have built-in speakers in order to serve for multimedia, most of
them are for desktop use and therefore not portable. Furthermore, there
exist docking devices for portable computers which have a built-in slot
for an AT bus with importance attached to portability see, for example, document EP-A-0 481 461. Most of them can
accommodate an AT bus card that is smaller than two-thirds of a full-size
AT bus card, but at present there is no docking device capable of
accommodating a full-size AT bus card itself. Incidentally, it may be
conceivable, as disclosed in Published Unexamined Patent Application No.
4-617, to form an opening in a side wall of a main body and accommodate a
full-size AT bus card through the opening with part projecting outward.
In this case, however, a new cover dedicated to this purpose needs to be
provided.Also known are docking devices for computers which have a bay
structure (with an accommodation space for a fixed or detachable memory,
etc.) for upgrading available functions. These are stationary docking
devices having only an SCSI (small computer system interface) in the bay
area.However, the above conventional docking devices for a computer in
which speakers are disposed in the rear portion of the main body facing
the back are associated with a problem of an inferior tone quality due to
the backward orientation of the speakers, to say nothing of stereo
effects. The desktop docking devices for computers capable of 
incorporating a full-size AT bus card are inconvenient because they are
not portable. The docking devices for a portable computer having the
built-in AT bus slot are inferior in function because they cannot
accommodate a full-size AT bus card. Furthermore, the conventional
docking

<CLAIMS>
A docking device for a portable computer, the docking device
providing mechanical and electrical connections to a portable

computer when it is placed in an operative position on the docking
device, to thereby enable the portable computer to perform more

functions, the docking device characterised by comprising:

a hollow main body having a support portion on which a portable
computer may be placed and fixed, and projecting portions projecting

from respective sides along the width of the support portion; and
a speaker located on each projecting portion of the main body.
A docking device for a portable computer as claimed in claim 1,
wherein a small computer system interface and an interface of a

kind different than the small computer system interface are
incorporated in an accommodation space provided in said main body.
A docking device for a portable computer as claimed in any of
claims 1 or 2, wherein the width of the main body, including said

projecting portions, is so set as to enable accommodation of a
full-size card.
