<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides for methods and apparatus for use 
in connection with the casting of bodies, e.g. of concrete 

panels, which are to contain within them one or more anchor 
members (40) which extend towards the surface of the body and 

are accessible within recesses formed in said surface. The 
releasible attachment of a recess former (10) to an anchor 

(40) to form an assembly for use in the casting of a body in 
which body the anchor (40) is to be secured during casting and 

from which body the recess former (10) is to be removed after 
casting to leave a cast recess containing a portion of the 

anchor (40) is provided in which a connector member (26) is 
applied to the said portion of the anchor (40) to engage at 

least one formation (42) provided on said anchor (40), the 
connector member (26) and the said portion of the anchor (40) 

are placed into a cavity (20) in the recess former (10), and 
the connector member (26) is releasably secured in the cavity 

(20), the arrangement being such that the walls (24) of the 
cavity (20) bear on the connector member (26) to prevent the 

disengagement thereof from the said formations (42) on the 
anchor (40) whilst the connector member (26) is in the cavity 

(26) in the recess former (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus
for use in connection with the casting of bodies, e.g. of
concrete panels, which are to contain within them one or more
anchor members which extend towards the surface of the body
and are accessible within recesses formed in said surface.Cast concrete panels and cast panels of like materials
are used in building works. To assist in the lifting and
transporting of such panels they are conventionally provided
with lifting points to which a crane hook may be attached.
For this purpose, anchors may be permanently embedded in the
panels extending towards surfaces of the panels at which ends
of the anchors are exposed within recesses formed in those
surfaces. The anchors are embedded in the panels at the time
the panels are cast. For this purpose, one end of the anchor
is secured in a recess former and the recess former is
attached to form work used in casting the panel. After the
panel has been cast and the form work removed, the recess
former is in turn removed leaving a recess in the surface of
the panel at which an end of the anchor is accessible.
Generally the anchor end will have a hole through it to which
a crane hook can be attached by a suitable lifting device.Lifting arrangements of this general type are described
in Specification GB-A-1595533 and recess formers for these
purposes are described in EP-A-0049455 and EP-A-0049456.The recess formers described in EP-A-0049455 and '456 are
relatively complex structures. They comprise an elastomeric
cover cast over rigid core parts connected by part of the
elastomeric shell so that they may be hinged with respect to
one another. The recess former has a roughly half-circular
shape with a radially extending through slot in its curved
face into which the end of an anchor may be received. A pair
of plug elements protrude from the walls of the slot toward 
one another within the slot and these engage in the through
hole in the top of the anchor to fasten the recess former to
the anchor. After the panel has been cast, the recess former
is levered off the anchor by flexing at the hinge referred to
above. In practice it is found that the action of prising off
the recess former causes damage and the former has to be
replaced after approximately twenty uses on average due to
excessive wear. Because of its relatively complex structure,
the recess former is relatively expensive to produce and
considerable waste is involved in large numbers of these
recess formers having to be discarded.EP-A-0498742 discloses a

A method of releasably attaching a recess former (10) to
an anchor (40) to form an assembly for use in the casting of

a body in which body the anchor (40) is to be secured during
casting and from which body the recess former (10) is to be

removed after casting to leave a cast recess containing a

portion of the anchor (40), characterised by the steps of
applying a connector member (26) to said portion of the anchor

(40) to engage at least one formation (42) provided on said
anchor (40), placing the connector member (26) and said

portion of the anchor (40) into a cavity (20) in said recess
former (10), and releasably securing said connector member

(26) in said cavity (20), the arrangement being such that the
walls (24) of the cavity (20) bear on the connector member

(26) to prevent the disengagement thereof from the said
formations (42) on the anchor (40) whilst said connector

member (26) is in said cavity (20) in the recess former (10).
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said connector
member (26) comprises a strap portion (28) foldable about a

mid region thereof over an end of said anchor (40) and having
at least one engagement formation (36) thereon for engagement

with said engagement formation or formations (42) of the
anchor (40).
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the connector
member (26) further comprises a mounting leg (30) extending

from said strap (28) mid portion and which is passed through
a through hole (18) in said recess former communicating with

said cavity (20) therein.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein said mounting leg
(30) is externally threaded and a nut (44) is received thereon

to secure the connector member (26) in position in said cavity
(20). 
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein said anchor (40)
has a through hole (42) therein as a said engagement formation

and said strap portion (28) of the connector member has one
or more plug elements (36) thereon as engagement formations

which enter into said through hole (42) in the anchor (40).
An assembly for use in the casting of a body in which
body an anchor (40) bearing a recess former (10) is secured

during casting and from which body the recess former (10) is
to be removed after casting to leave a cast recess containing

said cavity (20), characterised in that the walls (24) of said
cavity (20) bear on the connector member (26) to prevent the

disengagement thereof from the said formations (42) on the
anchor (40) whilst said connector member (26) is in said

cavity (20).
