<DESCRIPTION>
Zahler et al. in European Patent Application 
481,754 disclose 4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl-2-methylenecyclopentyl 
purines and pyrimidines of the 
formula 
wherein R₁ is a substituted purinyl or pyrimidinyl 
moiety.  Antiviral activity is exhibited by compounds 
having the formula 
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In 
formula 1, and throughout the specification, the 
symbols are as defined below. 
   R₂ is fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, hydrogen, 
methyl, trifluoromethyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 
2-chloroethyl, ethynyl, or 
   R₃ is chloro, bromo, iodo, hydrogen, methyl or 
trifluoromethyl. R₄ is alkyl. R₅ is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl or 
aryl. R₆ and R₇ are independently selected from 
hydrogen, -PO₃H₂, and 
Preferred compounds of formula 1 are those 
wherein
 
   R₁ is 
The term "alkyl" refers to both straight and 
branched chain groups. Those groups having 1 to 10 
carbons are preferred. The term "substituted alkyl" 
refers to alkyl groups having one or more, preferably 
one, substituents. Preferred substituents are 
halogen, amino, azido, hydroxy, cyano, trialkylammonium 
(wherein each alkyl group has 1 to 6 
carbons), alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbons, aryl and 
carboxy. The term "aryl" refers to phenyl and phenyl 
substituted with one, two or three substituents, 
preferably one. Preferred substituents are alkyl of 
1 to 6 carbons, alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbons, halogen, 
trifluoromethyl, amino, alkylamino of 1 to 6 carbons, 
dialkylamino wherein each alkyl is of 1 to 6 carbons, 
nitro, cyano, alkanoyloxy of 2 to 11 carbons, 
carboxy, carbamoyl and hydroxy.  The compounds of formula 1, and the pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof, are antiviral 
agents that can be used to treat viral infections in 
mammalian species such as domesticated animals (e.g., 
dogs, cats, horses and the like) and humans, and 
avian species (e.g., chickens and turkeys). The 
compounds of formula 1 wherein R₁ is 
are effective against one or more of the following 
viruses: herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster 
virus, and cytomegalovirus. They are also 
believed to be active against other DNA viruses. 
Exemplary DNA viruses in addition to those named  
 
above include other herpes viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr 
virus, pseudorabies virus, human herpes virus 6, 
and the like), poxvirus (e.g., vaccinia virus, monkey 
pox, and myoma), papovaviruses (e.g., the papilloma 
viruses), hepatitis B virus, and adenoviruses. All 
of the other compounds of formula 1 are believed to 
be active against one or more of
