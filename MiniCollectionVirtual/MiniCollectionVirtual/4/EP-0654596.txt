<ABSTRACT>
An annular composite insert 10 is cast which 
includes distinct particles 22 such as cast iron 

dispersed throughout the base metallic alloy 20. The 
insert 10 is then placed in a piston mold 24, and a 

piston 34 cast such that the insert 10 maintains a 
radially outer face 12 generally flush with a radially 

outer surface 40 of a piston head 36 of the piston. 
The base metal of the poured piston 34 is preferably 

the same as that of the insert 10 so that the insert 
bonds to the piston head and shares the same thermal 

expansion characteristics. The insert 10 is machined 
to form grooves 42 adapted to receive a piston ring. 

The particles of the insert are exposed to provide 
superior wear resistance, support to the piston ring so 

that microwelding is reduced, and also to act as a dry 
lubricant in a preferred embodiment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cast piston for
use in an internal combustion engine and more particularly to a
insert for use in such a piston.A piston for use in an internal combustion engine
typically includes an insert about its circumferential extent.
Grooves are formed in an outer radial face of the insert and are
adapted to receive piston rings. The insert is generally formed
from a ferrous alloy having a greater hardness and resistance to
wear than the material of the piston body and piston head.
However, the use of a ferrous alloy insert in a piston of a
dissimilar metal such as aluminum results in unequal thermal
expansion between the insert and the piston. As a result, a gap
may be formed between the insert and the piston head that acts
as a thermal barrier, preventing the transfer of heat from the
insert during piston operation. Further, such a gap may result
in undesirable localized stresses being applied by the piston on
a corresponding cylinder wall, reducing engine life. Complete
failure may occur if the insert separates from the piston.One alternative to a ferrous metal insert is an
insert formed of an alloy having increased hardness and wear
resistance with a thermal expansion similar to that of the
piston head and piston body. However, such alloys must be
customized for a particular application, and are both difficult
and expensive to develop. Further, the use of such an alloy
does not eliminate a problem known as microwelding, wherein
material from a piston ring and the insert are exchanged,
bonding the ring to the insert. Such unwanted bonding may 
result in piston failure. Nor do such alloys typically
provide any type of dry lubrication between a piston
ring and an insert.Another alternative to a ferrous metal insert
involves the use of methods wherein material is applied
in a customised fashion to a non-cast piston body and
head and then machined to form an insert. The
customised application of material to a non-cast piston
is expensive, and subject to unreliability.US-A-3533329 discloses a composite metal piston as
claimed in the precharacterising portion of claim 1, in
which the insert is of a different metal to the rest of
the piston.EP-A-112787 discloses a piston insert comprising
discrete iron particles.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a composite metal piston
having all of the features of claim 1.According to a second aspect of the present
invention there is provided a method as claimed in
claim 7.According to a preferred embodiment
