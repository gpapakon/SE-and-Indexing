<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for 
determining an endotoxin and an apparatus therefor. An endotoxin, one kind of pyrogens, has been measured 
by fever test using rabbits. However, the fever test using 
rabbits are being replaced by a test utilizing Limulus Amebocyte 
Lysate (LAL), derived from circulating blood cells of horseshoe 
crab, Limulus polyphemus, (Limulus test). Since a Limulus 
reaction is inhibited or promoted by substances present in a 
measurement system, a certain pre-treatment to remove the 
influence of substances must be done in many cases. As such the 
pre-treatment, there are dilution, heating, perchloric acid 
treatment and the like. However, all of these pre-treatments are 
insufficient to apply to endotoxin measurement in respect of 
specificity, sensitivity and quantitativeness. In order to solve 
these problems, the present inventors have already developed a 
method for determining an endotoxin using an endotoxin adsorbent 
(EP-A 350004). In order to improve the operation properties of the 
above method, the present inventors have also proposed another 
method wherein an endotoxin is adsorbed on an adsorbent and a 
reaction of adsorbed endotoxin with a Limulus reagent is carried 
out in a centrifugal filtration apparatus (EP-A 456252). In the above methods, there still remain problems to 
be improved in respect of operations in order to carry out the 
measurement at higher precision. That is, close attention must 
be paid to prevent contamination by endotoxins or reaction 
inhibiting substances derived from the outer atmosphere during 
operations. In addition, operations are not necessarily easy to 
be automated so that a large number of samples are treated more 
simply in a shorter period of time. Therefore, a main object of the present invention is 
to provide a further improved method for determining an endotoxin 
which is easy to operate and automate and an apparatus therefor. This object as well as other objects and advantages of 
the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in 
the art from the following description with reference to the 
accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a schematic view illustrating one 
embodiment of the apparatus for determination of the present 
invention. Figure 2 is a graph showing the calibration curve 
obtained in Example 1. The present invention provides a method for determining 
an endotoxin by reacting the endotoxin adsorbed on an adsorbent 
having specific endotoxin adsorbability with an endotoxin
