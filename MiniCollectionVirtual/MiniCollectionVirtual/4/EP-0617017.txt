<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of cyclohexene 
derivatives which are useful in the preparation of compounds having 
antibacterial activity. European Patent Application EPA No. 0416953A describes a novel class of 
tricyclic antibacterial agents and process for their preparation. Further the 
specification teaches that useful intermediates for preparing preferred 
antibacterial compounds specifically described and claimed therein are the 
cyclohexene derivatives of formula (I) 
wherein R₁ is a hydroxyl protecting group. The compounds of formula (I) are 
also described and claimed EPA No. 0466509A2. The present invention relates 
to a novel and improved process for preparing cyclohexene derivatives of 
formula (I). Thus the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds 
of formula (I) which comprises reaction of the azetidinone (II) wherein R₂ is 
C₁₋₄alkyl or an optionally substituted phenyl group, and R₁ is a hydroxyl 
protecting group, 
with the borane derivative (III) wherein R₃ is isopinocampheyl or 2-methylcyclohexyl.  in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid. Examples of suitable Lewis acids include dialkyl Zinc e.g. diethyl Zinc, trialkyl 
aluminium e.g. triethylaluminium, isopropoxides such as aluminium 
triisopropoxide or titanium tetraisopropoxide or alkyl boranes such as 
triethylborane. The reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent such as an ether 
e.g. tetrahydrofuran or a hydrocarbon such as hexane , or halohydrocarbon e.g. 
chlorobenzene or mixtures thereof and preferably at a temperature within the 
range -30⁰ to +30⁰. The borane derivative (III) may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding 
borane (R₃)₂BH (IV) with cyclohexadiene in a solvent such as a hydrocarbon 
e.g. hexane or chlorobenzene or an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran at a temperature 
within the range - 30 to +30o. The borane (IV) may be prepared by the reaction of borane dimethylsulphide 
complex with 1-S-(-)-alpha-pinene, or 1-methylcyclohexene. This reaction is 
preferably carried out in a solvent such as an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran or 
diethyl ether. The azetidinones of formula (II) are either known compounds or may be 
prepared by analogous methods to that described for known compounds. 
Preferred azetidinones for use in the reaction include compounds of formula (II) 
wherein R₁ is a trialkylsilyl group e.g. triC₁₋₄alkylsilyl group such as trimethyl 
silyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl and R₂ is a C₁₋₄alkyl e.g. methyl or a phenyl group., 
more particularly methyl. A
