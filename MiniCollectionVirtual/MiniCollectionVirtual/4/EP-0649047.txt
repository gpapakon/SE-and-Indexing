<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plastic optical
articles with excellent gas barrier properties,
conductivity, durability, heat resistance, abrasion
resistance, transparency and chemical resistance.Plastic materials in general are light-weight and have
excellent impact resistance, processability and mass-producibility,
and thus in recent years they have been in
great demand as materials for optical devices such as
optical filters, optical lenses and optical disks. At
present, transparent resins such as polymethylmethacrylate,
polystyrene and polycarbonate are mainly used as the plastic
materials for these optical devices.Research is being conducted to impart conductivity to
these plastic moldings for their increased functions.
Common methods for forming conductive films on moldings are
physical methods of forming metal oxides such as indium/tin
oxide (hereunder, ITO) and SnO2, or metals such as Au and Ag
by vacuum deposition or sputtering. Plastic molds with
conductive films obtained by these methods may be used as
materials for electronic circuit components such as
resistors; duplicating materials for electrophctographs and
electrophotographic recording; transparent electrodes for
electrochromic displays, electroluminescent displays and
signal input for touch panels; photoelectric conversion
elements such as solar cells and light amplifiers; as well
as for anti-static effects, electromagnetic wave blocking,
heating elements, sensors, and the like. In particular,
since such plastics may be made thinner and lighter in
weight, are more pliable and resistant to cracking, and have
more excellent workability than glass substrates, they are 
viewed with much promise as electrooptical elements for
liquid crystal displays. EP-A-0 499 492 proposes plastic optical
articles which comprise a transparent resin substrate.However, when plastic transparent resins are used as
substrates in liquid crystal displays, in comparison to
glass substrates their heat resistance and strength of
adhesion to the conductive films are low while their air
permeability and moisture permeability are high, leading to
problems such as deterioration of the liquid crystal
substance due to permeation of oxygen, and increased power
consumption of the display device due to permeation of
moisture, and consequently their effect on the life-span and
reliability of liquid crystal displays has been
considerable. As one publicly known example of improvement
of these problems there may be mentioned the method
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent
