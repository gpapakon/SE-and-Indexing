<ABSTRACT>
A glove, sock or the like, comprising a part being a barrier-layer (1) within which a lining (5) or parts of a lining (5) is/are arranged, whereby the lining (5) is fixed within the outer part (1) by means of at least one tape (3, 4) which is attached to the lining (5) at one of its ends by attachment means (2, 7), preferebly a seam (2), at which said attachment means (2) is positioned at a distance from the inner extreme (E) of said lining (5) or part of the lining (5) and that the tape (3, 4) extends in a direction towards said inner extreme (E).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a glove or a sock, with
at least two layers, preferebly a glove with one
non waterpermeable layer.This invention mainly concerns multilayergloves
with one non permeable layer. Thanks to recently
develloped materials of the barrier-layer type,
like GoreTex®,that does not let liquids through but
the air and steam, such gloves can be moore usable
than what was possible earlier. At production there
is a problem with such a barrier-layer, due to
problems concerning sealing it can not be sewn.
Particularily for gloves this causes difficulties
with the attachment of a lining within in for
example a finger having a barrier-layer. In
consequence many producers do not at all attach the
lining to the barrier-layer, which is most
unsatisfying as the lining easily comes out with
the hand when taking off the glove.There has been attempts to solve the problems
mentioned above by fixing the lining to the
barrier-layer with tape. Known applications where
tape has been used have however proven limited
strength.An assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from
US-A-5 020 161. The object of this invention is to solve the above
mentioned problems in such a way that a lining can
be attached within a glove or a sock containing a
barrier-layer without any risk of causing leakage
and without any risk for the lining to come loose
when the glove or sock is taken off.This object is accomplished by the characterising
features of claim 1. Particular embodiments of the invention
are set out in dependent claims 2 to 5.In the following the invention is explained in more
detail with reference to the figures, in which:
Fig 1shows a part of a finger of a glove in
cross-section according to the inventionFig 2shows a finger of a glove in cross-section
comprising a futher layer
compared to the glove shown in fig 1.Fig 3shows a known gloveIn figure 1 there is shown a preferred arrangement
of a glove according to the invention with an outer
barrier-layer 1 within which there has been
arranged a lining 5. The barrier-layer 1 consists
in the preferred example of a material that does 
not let liquids through but steam of a certain
partial-pressure will pass,such as for example a
Gore-Tex® material. The main object of the lining 5
is to enhance the comfort for the user of the glove
but it also in some cases has an isolating
function. To make sure that the lining 5 will stay
within the barrier-layer 1 ,when the glove is taken
off the hand, a tape 3,4 is positioned between
them. The tape 3,4 consists in the

or parts of a lining (5) is/are arranged, said lining or parts of the lining having an outer extremity

within said barrier-layer, whereby the lining (5) is fixed within the outer barrier-layer (1) by

means of at least one tape (3,4) which is attached to the lining (5) at one of its ends by
attachment means (2,7), preferably a seam, 
characterized
