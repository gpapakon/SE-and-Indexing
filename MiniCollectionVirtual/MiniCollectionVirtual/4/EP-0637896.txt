<ABSTRACT>
In an earphone assembly, a front cap portion of an 
outer casing (5) having an electroacoustic transducing 

device (12) therein has a substantially circular 
configuration which is greater in diameter than other 

portions to be able to fit in the cavity of the auricle. 
The earphone comprises a cord supporting member (4) of a 

connection cord (3) of the electroacoustic transducing 
device (12) and a movable member (10) which is pivotable 

with respect to the outer casing (5). A protruding portion 
(2a) of the outer casing protrudes peripherally from a 

peripheral portion of the front cap member thereof. The 
protruding portion (11) of the movable member (10) 

cooperates with the peripheral portion of the front cap 
member of the outer casing (5) to allow the earphone to fit 

in the cavity of the auricle (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an earphone, and is
more particularly directed to a compact earphone assembly
having an electroacoustic transducer element for
transducing an electric signal derived from an audio device
into a sound, the earphone directly fitting in an auricle
of a person to allow the person to listen to the sound.In recent years, there has been increasingly used a
compact light-weight earphone to fit in a cavity of an
auricle instead of a type to be inserted into an external
auditory meatus or of a headphone type provided with a
headband. Furthermore, in company with popularization of
portable audio devices, there is a growing demand for
making earphones lighter in weight and with improved
attachability.A conventional earphone is shown in Figs. 6A and 6B,
of the accompanying drawings. As shown, a housing body 1
incorporates an electroacoustic transducer element, and a
front cap member 2 covers the front surface of the
electroacoustic transducer element. A connection cord 3 is
guided through a cord supporting member 4 from the housing
body 1 to the outside to supply on electric power signal
from an audio apparatus to the electroacoustic transducer
element. An outer casing 5 is of a substantially
elliptical shape having a major diameter L1 and a minor
diameter L2, which generically comprises the housing body
1 and the front cap member 2. Reference numerals 6, 7, 8,
and 9 respectively denote the external auditory meatus,
tragus, antitragus, and auricle of a person.The peripheral portion of the front surface of the
outer casing 5 has an oval configuration. The reason why
the front surface has an oval configuration is that an
outer diameter of 17.4 mm is required for internally
storing the electroacoustic transducer element when a
circular configuration is adopted for the front surface,
which results in an increased pressure to be applied to the 
user. Therefore, an oval shape is adopted for the front
surface which has a minimal size. Such an earphone fits in
the cavity of the auricle 9, so that the earphone can be
retained in the ear in consequence of the effect that the
cord supporting member 4 is caught between the tragus 7 and
the antitragus 8 and that the outer casing 5 is in contact
with both a portion of the tragus 7 on the side of the
external auditory meatus 6 and the cavity of the auricle 9.However, since the conventional earphone as described
above has a fixed configuration (particularly the
dimensions L1 and L2 shown in Fig. 6 A), there has been a
problem that the earphone tends

An earphone assembly comprising:

a substantially circular outer casing (5) to be fit in
a cavity of a human auricle, the outer casing (5) having a

housing body (1) and a front outer portion (2) having a
peripheral portion, and an electroacoustic transducer

element (12) securely incorporated in said outer casing (5);
a cord supporting member (4) for supporting a
connection cord (3) extending from the electroacoustic

transducer element (12) to outside of the outer casino (5); and
a movable member (10) of generally annular shape
which is rotatable with respect to an outer circumference

of the outer casing (5),

   
characterised in that
 the peripheral
front outer portion (2) of the outer casing(5) has

a substantially circular configuration and is provided with a
protruding portion (2a) which protrudes outward from a part

of the peripheral portion thereof and which is positioned
at a specified angle with respect to a reference line (X)

of the cord supporting member (4), and the movable member
(10) has a protruding portion (11) which protrudes

from a part of a peripheral portion of the movable member (10)
further outwardly than the peripheral portion of the front

outer portion (2), whereby, by rotating the movable member
(10) for adjusting the position of its protruding

portion (11), the protruding portion (11) of the
movable member (10) cooperates with the protruding portion

(2a) of the outer casing (5) and with the peripheral portion of the front outer portion (2)
so that the apparent outer diameter of the front peripheral

portion between the protruding portion (2a) of the
front outer portion (2) of the outer casing (5) and the protruding portion

(11) of the movable member (10) is changed to be fit in the
cavity of an auricle (9) of different sizes.
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
protruding portion (11) of the movable member (10) is movable in

its pivotal range which includes at least a position 
approximately diametrically opposite to the protruding

portion (2a) of the outer casing (5).
An assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
protruding portion (11) of the movable member (10) is pivotable

in the range between a specified clockwise angle of
approximately 15 degrees and a specified counterclockwise

angle of approximately 45 degrees with respect to a
horizontal reference line (Y) of the housing body (1).
