<ABSTRACT>
A spike-shaped probe (2) is placed extremely close 
to an object (11) to be measured. This probe is made of 

an optically active material. The probe is not electrically 
conductive as it is, so that it does not electrically affect the 

object. However, if light pulses are applied to the probe, 
the probe becomes a conductor. As a result, a current flows 

between the probe and the object to make it possible to measure 
the potential of the object. This probe can also function as a 

probe for an interatomic force microscope. With this probe, it is 
possible to measure high-speed electric waveforms, monitor the 

position of the probe with a highly precise spacial resolution, 
and determine the points of control and measurement and 

others. Thus a highly reliable measurement can be implemented 
at a low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention will be utilized for semiconductor research and manufacture, and
it relates in particular to techniques for measuring the operating state of high-speed
integrated electronic circuits. It will be utilized for the observation and measurement
of extremely small, precise structures, and as a precision measuring instrument
capable of measuring the electrical characteristics of electric circuits on which
extremely minute mechanical structures have been formed, and where the spacing
between adjacent circuits is extremely small. This invention is suited for utilization
in semiconductor device manufacture and research, and it has been developed in order
to make electrical measurements of the operating state of high-speed integrated
electronic circuits.The frequency of the signals that are dealt with in the field of electronics has
recently reached 250GHz, and the current status of high-speed electrical measuring
technology is that the methods employed to observe these high-speed electric
waveforms have not kept up with technical progress. Furthermore, advances in the
miniaturization of circuit elements have led to a situation in which neither the temporal
resolution nor the spatial resolution of electric measuring instruments has kept up with
current technical progress.An established and representative means of observing high-speed phenomena
such as the high-speed operating state of microcircuit elements is the sampling
oscilloscope. In addition, studies have recently been made of EO sampling, a
technique which utilizes the electro-optic effect in electro-optic crystals (see Kamiya,
T. and Takahashi, M., "Electro-optic sampling using semiconductor lasers," Öyö
Butsuri, Vol.61, No. 1, p.30, 1992; and Nagatsuma, T., "Measurement of high-speed
devices and integrated circuits using electro-optic sampling technique," IEICE Trans.
Electron., Vol.E-76C, No. 1, January 1993). Given that it has become comparatively
easy in the field of laser technology to obtain optical pulses in the subpicosecond
range, optical sampling techniques seek to use such laser pulses for sampling electric
signals. These techniques are faster than conventional electronic measurements, and
can provide direct, non-contact measurements of electric potential at a desired point
on a circuit under test, without leading out the signal. In other words, with this
technique the electric pulses used for sampling in a sampling oscilloscope are replaced
with optical pulses.Another method for making high spatial resolution direct measurements
