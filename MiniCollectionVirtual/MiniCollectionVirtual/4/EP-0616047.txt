<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polycrystalline 
diamond substrate, more particularly to a polycrystalline 
diamond substrate having a smooth surface and a process 
for producing such a polycrystalline diamond substrate. Diamond has the highest hardness among all of the 
solid materials which are present on the earth, is 
electrically an insulator and has the highest thermal 
conductivity within a temperature range of 30 to 650 °C. 
In addition, diamond optically has an excellent light 
transmission characteristic in a wide wavelength range 
except for a certain part of an infrared region. 
Therefore, diamond having such outstanding 
characteristics is expected to be utilized in various 
technical or scientific fields. Further, diamond has the highest sound velocity 
among all of the substances, and is stable thermally and 
chemically. Therefore, by utilizing such characteristics 
of diamond, for example, an application of diamond to 
devices such as surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices has 
been investigated. A surface acoustic wave device  
 
utilizing diamond can be used in an extremely high 
frequency region, e.g., by using a diamond film as a 
substrate, as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application Nos. Sho 64-62911 (No. 62911/1989) and Hei 3-198412 
(No. 198412/1991). The surface acoustic wave device using a diamond 
film as a substrate may be fabricated in the following 
manner. First, a diamond film is formed on a substrate of Si, 
etc., by vapor-phase synthesis. Next, the surface of the 
vapor-phase synthesized diamond film is polished to be 
smooth. Further, the vapor-phase synthesized diamond 
film having the smooth surface is used as a substrate, and 
an electrode is formed thereon by microfabrication. As described above, when a surface acoustic wave 
device using a diamond film as a substrate is intended to 
be fabricated, the surface of the diamond film formed by 
vapor-phase synthesis is polished before an electrode is 
formed on the diamond film. However, since the diamond has a high hardness, 
polishing of the surface thereof is not sufficient in 
some cases, and therefore some scratches caused by the 
polishing can be left on the surface. Further, since the 
vapor-phase synthesized diamond film is polycrystalline, 
dropout of some particles may occur due to the polishing 
treatment, or an unfilled or unoccupied portion remaining  
 
in the inside of the diamond film may appear on the 
surface thereof as a hole due to the polishing. 
Therefore, in general, some pits or
