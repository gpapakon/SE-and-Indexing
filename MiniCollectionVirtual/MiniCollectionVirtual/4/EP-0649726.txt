<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a thermal dye transfer 
receiver element comprising: 


a) coextruding a dye image-receiving layer with 
an orientable thermoplastic resin to form a cast 

film; 
b) stretching the cast film to reduce the 
thickness of the dye image-receiving layer and to 

produce an oriented composite film; and 
c) laminating the oriented composite film to a 
support.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
making dye-receiving elements used in thermal dye
transfer, and more particularly to receiving elements
made by coextruding a dye image-receiving layer and an
orientable thermoplastic resin carrier layer prior to
stretching and laminating to a support.In recent years, thermal transfer systems
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures
which have been generated electronically from a color
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to
color separation by color filters. The respective
color-separated images are then converted into
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals.
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal
printing head has many heating elements and is heated
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a
screen. Further details of this process and an
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S.
Patent No. 4,621,271.U.S. Patent 4,912,085 discloses that receiver
layers can be coextruded with thermoplastic receiver
supports and then stretched. However, this technique
is limited since it can only be applied to supports 
which can be stretched. It is an object of this
invention to provide a technique which could be applied
to non-stretchable supports such as paper.In U.S. Patent 5,244,861, dye-receiving
elements are disclosed wherein a dye image-receiving
layer is coated onto a composite film laminated to a
support. The composite film comprises a microvoided
thermoplastic core layer and at least one substantially
void-free thermoplastic surface layer. There is a
problem with this technique in that the dye image-receiving
layer is solvent coated onto the support.
Solvent coating processes are rather expensive and
create environmentally unfriendly waste products such
as solvent based solutions as well as solvent vapor.It is an object of the invention to provide a
process for preparing receiving elements with both the
ecological and cost advantages of
