<ABSTRACT>
A process for treating a coated substrate (2) to reduce the thickness of the coating (6) 
involves directing a laser beam (10) at a predetermined surface portion (14) of the substrate (2) 

to remove part of the coating. The process can be used to treat a coated photoreceptor (2) to 
precisely reduce the thickness of the coating (6) in a predetermined region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for reducing the thickness of a polymeric photoconductive coating
on a photoreceptor.In the manufacture of coated substrates such as layered photoreceptors, it is often
desirable to uniformly reduce the thickness of a coating in a predetermined region. For
example, in producing coated photoreceptors, it is frequently necessary to reduce the
thickness of the photoreceptor's seams, taper or seal edges of the photoreceptor, or remove
excess material in the "sag" area of a dip-coated photoreceptor drum. Sag areas are
regions of thicker coating formed when wet coating material migrates down the side of a
dip-coated drum as the drum is lifted out of a coating bath.Conventionally, coated substrate surfaces are treated to remove excess coating
material by applying chemical solvents or by mechanically machining the substrate surface.
However, chemical or mechanical treatments often do not provide the treated substrate with
a sufficiently uniform and smoothly polished surface suitable for certain commercial uses
such as the manufacture of photoreceptors. Chemical treatments can cause solvent
droplets or vapor to contact the coating in regions that are not intended to be removed,
reducing the quality of the photoreceptor. Furthermore, organic solvents have a limited
useful life and are hazardous to work with. Mechanical machining techniques for removing
coatings are cumbersome, inefficient, and often produce photoreceptors of unacceptable
quality. Moreover, chemical or mechanical treatments do not achieve precise tolerances,
which renders such processes unsuitable for reducing the thickness of a coating such as a
polymer coating on a predetermined surface region of the substrate.A laser treatment method for trimming thick film hybrids
