<ABSTRACT>
Machine intended for cutting woven materials, especially fabric webs, in a transversal or longitudinal direction and, more particularly, for cutting automatically at right angles to the thread. It comprises, on the one hand, a frame (1), to which is fixed pivotably about a vertical axis (40) intersecting the theoretical cutting axis (20) a rectilinear cutting blade (5) which is positioned in a vertical plane and is inclined relative to the horizontal and which intersects the horizontal plane containing the fabric web (2) to be cut, its cutting edge (50) being directed upwards, the blade (5) and the fabric web (2) being displaced relative to one another parallel to the theoretical cutting axis (20); on the other hand, means (10, 11, 14) for detecting the deviations of the blade (5) in relation to the cutting axis (20); and, on the other hand, also means (13) for the displacement of the fabric web (2), downstream of the cutting axis in relation to the pivot axis (40) of the blade (5), perpendicularly to the said cutting axis (20), this displacement being controlled by the said means (10, 11, 14) for detecting the deviations of the blade (5).

Machine for automatically cutting at the right of the
yarn of the woven material, especially fabric strips, in a

transverse or longitudinal direction, said machine comprising
a frame (1) to which a rectilinear cutting blade (5) is

rendered integral so as to pivot around a vertical axis (40)
cutting the theoretical cutting axis (20), said cutting blade

being positioned inside a vertical plane and slanted with
respect to horizontal and cutting the horizontal plane

containing the fabric strip (2) to be cut, its cutting edge
(50) being directed upwards, the blade (5) and the fabric

strip (2) being in relative displacement of one with respect
to the other parallel to the theoretical cutting axis (20),

characterised in that the blade (5) is rendered integral with
the vertical axis (40) by means of a horizontal arm (4) whose

said vertical axis (40) traverses one of the extremities and
which is able to be temporarily supported by retractable

holding elements (43, 44) in a position to ensure that the
blade (5) is within the same vertical plane as the

theoretical cutting axis (20), and secondly in that it
includes means (10,11,14) for detecting deviations of the

blade (5) with respect to the cutting axis (20), and means
(13) for moving the fabric strip (2) downstream of the

cutting axis with respect to the vertical axis (40) of the
blade (5), this movement being automatically controlled at

said means (10,11,14) for detecting the deviations of the
blade (5). 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
said detection means (10,11,14) include two opto-electronic

cells (10, 11) positioned downstream of the cutting axis (20)
on both side of the latter and orientated towards the

pivoting arm (4) which is fitted at its extremity with a mask
(14) disposed opposite said cells (10,11).
Machine according to claim 2, characterised in that
the horizontal arm (4) is traversed by a second axis (41)

parallel to the axis (40) at the extremity of which a loose
roller is rendered integral and is inserted with slight play

between the two retractable retention elements (43, 44)
constituted by two guides positioned on both sides of the

vertical plane containing the cutting axis (20) and mounted
pivoting inside a horizontal plane.
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
the vertical axis (40) is rendered integral with a carriage

(3) able to move in horizontal translation parallel to the
cutting axis (20), the fabric strip (2) being kept upstream

of the cutting axis and on both sides of the latter by two
mobile clamps (120, 121) spaced with respect to each other,

and downstream of said cutting axis (20) by two mobile clamps
(130, 131) spaced with respect to each other and with respect

to the other two clamps (120, 121).
Machine according to claim 4, characterised in that
the clamps (130, 131) situated downstream of the cutting axis

(20) are mobile inside a horizontal plane by moving in a
given direction perpendicular to said cutting axis (20), this

movement being Automatically controlled at the detection,
cells (10, 11). 
Machine according to claim 4, characterised in that
the carriage (3) is also mobile inside a horizontal plane by

moving perpendicular to the cutting axis (20), this movement
being automatically controlled at the detection cells (10,

11).
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
the vertical axis (40) of the blade (5) is integral with the

frame (1), the fabric strip (20) being taut between two
rollers, namely an unwinding roller and a winding roller.
Machine according to claim 7, characterised in that
the unwinding roller is able to move inside a horizontal

plane perpendicular to the cutting axis (20), this movement
being automatically controlled at the detection cells (10,

11).
Machine according to claim 7, characterised in that
the vertical axis (40) of the blade (5) is able to move

inside a horizontal plane perpendicular to the cutting axis
(20), this movement being automatically controlled at the

detection cells (10,11).
Machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the cutting edge (50) of the

blade (5) is less sharp and comprises two slanted planes (53,
54) with identical angles.
Machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the inclination of the blade

(5) is variable.
Machine according to claim 10 or 11, characterised
in that the blade (5) comprises two shoulders (51) and (52)

situated at the rear of the slanted planes (53, 54) defining
the cutting edge (50). 
Machine according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the blade (5) is connected to a

motor (60) which actuates it according to an alternative
movement similar to that of a piercing saw.
