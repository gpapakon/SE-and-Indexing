A process for the production of alkyl and/or alkenyl 
oligoglucosides, 
characterized in that
a) aqueous glucose sirups and fatty alcohols are dried 
in a turbo dryer with rotating fittings to a residual 

water content of 0.05 to 0.3% by weight and 
b) the resulting glucose/fatty alcohol suspensions are 
acetalized in known manner in the presence of acidic 

catalysts. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 glucose sirup with a solids content of 50 to 85% by 
weight and a DP1 degree (monomeric glucose content) of 80 

to 99% by weight, based on the solids, is used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 fatty alcohols corresponding to formula (I): 

R
1
OH
 
in which R
1
 is a linear or branched alkyl and/or alkenyl 
radical containing 6 to 22 carbon atoms,
 
are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 glucose sirup and fatty alcohol are used in a molar 
ratio of 1:2 to 1:10, based on the glucose in the sirup. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 drying is carried out at a temperature of 120 to 
200Â°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 drying is carried out in the presence of air, inert 
gas and/or superheated steam.
