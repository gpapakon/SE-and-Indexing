<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing arsenic from a fluid in the presence of a solid scavenger. The said scavenger contains copper and sulphur at least partly in the form of copper sulphide and results (a) from the incorporation of a copper compound, other than a sulphide, onto a solid inorganic support, (b) from an optional calcination of the product obtained in stage (a), from bringing the product obtained above into contact with elemental sulphur and (d) from a heat treatment.

A method of eliminating from a gaseous or liquid fluid
arsenic or at least one arsenic compound, in which method the

said fluid is brought into contact with a solid arsenic
recovery mass containing a solid mineral dispersant or

support, essentially copper and sulphur combined at least
partly in the form of copper sulphide, the said mass

containing 8 to 25 % by weight of copper sulphide, the
greater part of the sulphide being in the form of CuS, the

said mass being the product resulting from the following
stages :


a/ at least one copper compound other than a sulphide is
incorporated into a solid mineral dispe
rsant or support,
b/ on the hypothesis that the said compound is not a copper
oxide, the product obtained in stage (a) is calcined to

convert the copper compound or compounds which it contains at
least partially into copper oxide (CuO and/or Cu
2
O),
c/ the product obtained in stage (b) or in stage (a) if there
has not been a stage (b) is brought into contact with

elementary sulphur,
d/ the product obtained in stage (c) is subjected to a heat
treatment in a non oxidising atmosphere accompanied by

scavenging with gas, at a temperature and for a period which
are sufficient to allow the formation of sulphide of the

metal or metals present.
A method according to claim 1 in which the said mass is used
in a fixed bed.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 2 in which the said
fluid is a natural gas essentially containing methane and

saturated hydrocarbons higher than methane. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 in which the said
fluid is a hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4 in which the said
fluid is a gas condensate.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 in which silver
or iron is introduced onto the support.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 6 in which the
atomic ratio of sulphur to active metals present in the mass

is 0.8 : 1 to 2 : 1.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 7 in which the mass
comprises only copper as an active metal and in which the

atomic ratio S/Cu is 0.8 : 1 to 2 : 1.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 in which during
the course of stage (c) the elementary sulphur is used at

least partly in solution in an organic solvent.
A method according to claim 9 in which stage (c) is
carried out adding at least one reducing compound to the

solution.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 in which stages
(c) and (d) are carried out as follows : mixture of the

support charged with copper oxide with elementary sulphur,
heat treatment under an inert gas, impregnation with dilute

formic acid, final heat treatment.
A method according to claim 11 in which heat treatment is
carried out under water vapour. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 in which stages
(c) and (d) are carried out as follows : mixture of the

support charged with copper oxide with elementary sulphur,
simultaneous impregnation with dilute formic acid, heat

treatment at 140-150°C under an inert gas.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 in which stages
(c) and (d) are carried out as follows : treatment of the

support charged with copper oxide with a reducing agent,
mixture with elementary sulphur, heat treatment at 200-220°C

under an inert gas.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 in which a stage
(b') of reducing treatment is incorporated, following stage

(b) in the event of the copper having been deposed by
impregnation or at the end of stage (a) if a copper oxide has

been added by wet mixture with a support.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 15 in which
precursor resulting from stage ( c ) is subjected to heat

treatment in a non-oxidizing atmosphere in presence of a
reducing compound.
A method according to one of the claims 1-10, 14-16 in
which the reducing compound is chosen from the group

consisting in hydrogen, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic
acid, hydrazine.

S
y

A method according to one of claims 1 to 18 in which at
least 60 % of copper by weight is in the form of sulphide.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 19 in which an
aqueous copper nitrate solution is used during the course of

stage (a).
