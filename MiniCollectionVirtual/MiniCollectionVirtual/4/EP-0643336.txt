<ABSTRACT>
The positively chargeable toner includes a binder 
resin and a coloring agent, the binder resin including (a) 

a resin (1) capable of forming a matrix in the toner, the 
resin (1) being a hybrid resin of a polyester resin and a 

vinyl resin; and (b) a resin (2) capable of forming a 
domain dispersed in the matrix formed by the resin (1), 

the resin (2) being a vinyl resin having a positive charge 
functional group. This positively chargeable toner has a 

good evenness of chargeability and a high charging-up 
speed with a small proportion of a reversely charged toner 

upon triboelectric charging. Moreover, in a heat roller 
fixing method, fixing at a low temperature can be 

performed without using an offset inhibiting liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner binder resin
and also to a positively chargeable toner containing
such a binder resin, wherein the toner is used for
developing latent images in electrophotography,
electrostatic recording, electrostatic printing, etc.As disclosed in US-A-2,297,691, US-A-2,357,809,
and other publications, conventional
electrophotography comprises the steps of forming an
electrostatic latent image by evenly charging a
photoconductive insulating layer and subsequently exposing
the layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion,
and visualizing the formed image by adhering colored
charged fine powder known as a toner to the latent image
(a developing process); transferring the obtained visible
image to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper
(a transfer process); and permanently fixing the
transferred image by heating, pressure application or
other appropriate means of fixing (a fixing process).As indicated above, a toner must meet the
requirements not only in the development process but also 
in the transfer process and fixing process.In general, in order to obtain a positively
chargeable toner, a binder resin used therefor is a
styrene-acrylic resin which can be easily positively
charged. However, the styrene-acrylic resin has low
mechanical properties, so that the resulting toner is less
durable for continuous printing. Also, when a resin
having a relatively high molecular weight is used in order
to solve this problem, the fixing ability of the toner
becomes extremely poor. Further, although a polyester
resin having excellent mechanical properties can provide
both good fixing ability and stability upon continuous
printing, its negative chargeability is too strong, making
it difficult to provide positive chargeability.In order to solve the above problems, the following
methods for blending polyester resins having excellent
fixing ability with styrene-acrylic resins having a small
change in the triboelectric charge under the
high-temperature, high-humidity conditions when compared
with that under normal-temperature, normal-humidity
conditions have been known. For instance, examples of
such methods include:
(1) Methods for blending polyester resins with
styrene-acrylic resins (see JP-A-49-6931, JP-A-54-114245,
JP-A-57-70523, and JP-A-2-161464);(2) Methods for chemically linking polyester resins with
styrene-acrylic resins ( see JP-A-56-116043); (3) Methods for copolymerizing unsaturated polyesters
with vinyl monomers ( see JP-A-57-60339, JP-A-63-279265,
JP-A-1-156759,
