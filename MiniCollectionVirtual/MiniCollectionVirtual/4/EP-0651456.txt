<ABSTRACT>
In a tool for boosting (jump starting) a vehicle, it is know that there is 
a battery as a power source and booster cables to bring the energy to the 

engine. In this invention, the battery and the cables are incorporated into one 
unit which includes the battery, the cables and protective holsters (housing) to 

lodge the cables. The holsters are an integral part of the unit and swivel at 
90Â° (degrees) to permit easy access. In this way, everything can be carried in 

one hand. Also, because the unit can be easily placed close to the engine, the 
cables can be much shorter than regular booster cables. It is easier to use 

since there are only two connections to make instead of four. Finally, the 
holsters, which house the booster clips protect the user from short circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to batteries and more specifically to
batteries that are moved from location to location, to connect to different
devices, especially discharged or dead batteries of motor vehicles.Most automobiles are presently powered by an internal combustion
engine which must be spun up to speed externally before they can operate.
The engines are usually spun up to speed by an electric motor that is powered
by a battery. The battery is then charged by a generator connected to the
engine once the engine is operating or running. The battery is usually able to 
store enough charge for the periods that the engine is not running in order to
start the engine when needed.When the battery does not have sufficient charge to start the engine,
a way must be found to recharge the battery or bypass the battery with a
separate charge. Since very often a discharged battery is caused by an external
drain such as leaving the lights on or playing the radio, once the engine is
started by either recharging the battery or bypassing it by sending a separate
charge the automobile will continue to operate properly.Since there are many things that will temporally cause a battery to lose
its charge, the need to recharge or bypass batteries with separate charges is
common. Very often another or booster battery is brought to the vicinity of
the dead battery and electrical cables are used to connect the booster battery
to the dead battery in parallel in order to recharge and/or bypass the dead
battery. This often known as boosting or jump starting the dead battery or
engine.In this method of boosting, the cables are disconnected from the
batteries after each use so as to prevent short circuits. This method and
structure however, is cumbersome since there are at least two parts and they
demand great attention since there are 4 connections to make and a bad
connection in either one will result in a short circuit or failure to start the
engine. Some manufacturers have tried to resolve the problem by combining
the battery and cables in one unit. The problems that have arisen with these
units are that the cables which are permanently connected to the battery are
always live so they have to be protected as to not touch each other. The
amount of amperage available in these batteries is very large and if the cables
touch each other it would issue a short circuit and damage the cables and
batteries. To isolate the live cables, some manufacturers have used protective
pouches. These are not practical to use since they are
