<ABSTRACT>
The rotational speed difference between rotational 
speeds of front and rear road wheels of a motor vehicle is 

weighted by a first ratio, and the difference between the rotational 
speed difference between rotational speeds of front 

left and right road wheels and an average signal of reference 
steering angle or between the rotational speed difference between 

rotational speeds of rear left and right road wheels 
and the average signal of reference steering angle is 

weighted by a second ratio. A sum signal representative of 
the sum of the rotational speed difference weighted by the 

first ratio and the difference weighted by the second ratio 
is used to determine a pneumatic tire pressure reduction 

highly accurately even when running conditions of the motor 
vehicle change such as when the motor vehicle makes a turn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for determining
a pneumatic tire pressure of road wheels on a motor
vehicle, according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1.Such a system is known from EP-A-0 554 131. An alarm unit
connected to the known system is energized if the pressure
reduction determining means detects that the front rotational
speed difference is different from the reference rotational speed
difference to a certain extent or if the pressure reduction
determining means detects that the rear rotational speed
difference is different from the reference rotational speed
difference to a certain extent.The pneumatic tire pressure determining system disclosed in DE-A-32
36 520 detects differences between individual wheel speeds and
a stored reference wheel speed. If at least one of these
differences falls outside a predetermined range, a corresponding
tire pressure reduction signal is output. Further known pneumatic tire pressure determining systems
are disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 56-10202 and
Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 63-305011, for example.The pneumatic tire pressure determining system disclosed
in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 56-10202
has pressure sensors attached to respective road wheels. The
pneumatic tire pressure determining system disclosed in
Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 63-305011 detects
the angular velocities of road wheels, and compares the angular
velocity of each of the road wheels with the average
value of the angular velocities of the road wheels for determining
a reduction in the pneumatic pressure in any of the
tires of the road wheels.The pneumatic tire pressure determining system disclosed
in the latter publication cannot determine the pneumatic
tire pressures highly accurately and hence is not
highly reliable. Specifically, because only the angular velocities
of the road wheels are used as a reference value,
the difference between radii of curvature of paths of the
road wheels cannot be calculated while the motor vehicle is
making a turn. The steering system of the motor vehicle
tends to suffer a mechanical error even when the motor vehicle
is running straight. Consequently, the disclosed pneumatic
tire pressure determining system can determine a reduction
in the pneumatic tire pressure only in a certain range
of motor vehicle motions. It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a pneumatic tire pressure determining system capable
of detecting the pressure of a pneumatic tire highly
