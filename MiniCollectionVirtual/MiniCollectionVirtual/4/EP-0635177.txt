<ABSTRACT>
In order, during data reduction of an already data-reduced audio signal, or during the first data reduction of an audio signal, to reduce interference effects, making allowance for code violations, the invention proposes that, in the event of a code overload, a code is selected which gives the optimum interference distribution as regards reproduction quality. The time behaviour and/or spectral distribution of the audio signal can be modified, in particular before encoding, in accordance with a selected adjustment model, without any significant signal deterioration being subjectively perceivable by the listener after decoding.

<CLAIMS>
Method of transmitting and/or storing digitalized, 
source-encoded audio signals, which during the 

source-encoding, are subjected to a data-reduction, to 
the effect that the bit rate of the source-encoded audio 

signal is matched to the capacity of the transmission 
channel or storage medium, 
characterized in that
 if 
exceeding of a given bit number is to be expected in the 

case of the source-encoded audio signal, the digitalized 
audio signal is analyzed prior to its source-encoding in 

its course of time and/or in its spectral distribution and 
is changed according to a selected matching pattern, to 

the effect that, with acceptance of source code damage, 
the interference caused thereby is minimized. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 with a 
stereophonic coding, with which two or more audio signals 

are coded together or interdependently, the specific 
change of the signals takes place prior to the coding 

as regards the mutual level ratios of the audio signals. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
particularly with very low bit rates of the data-reduced 

audio signal, the specific change of the digital signal is 
carried out prior to the coding to the effect that the 

intelligibility of the audio signal or signals is 
maintained or possibly improved. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 during 
coding of the digital signal, an allocation of code bits 

takes place according to the previous, specific change 
of the digital signal. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in 
that
 the selection of the code or the specific variation 
of the audio signal is in each case again determined after 

brief intervals of time prior to the coding.
