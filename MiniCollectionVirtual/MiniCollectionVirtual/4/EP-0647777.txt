<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a convergent-divergent axisymmetric jet pipe (nozzle) with thrust reversal. The flaps of the divergent part (10) are distributed as two first diametrically opposed assemblies (14a, 14b) borne by stationary lateral supports (16a, 16b) and as two second assemblies (15a, 15b) borne by hoops (17a, 17b) articulated to the supports (16a, 16b) and capable of being tilted backwards. The tilting of the hoops (17a, 17b) causes the second assemblies (15a, 15b) to be tilted, this forming a thrust reverser. The cold flaps (6) are at least partially retractable in the "thrust reversal" position.

Convergent/divergent axisymmetric nozzle for an 
aviation turbojet engine, the said nozzle including an 

outer circle (6) of cold flaps and an inner circle (8) of 
hot flaps, the said inner circle (8) of hot flaps comprising 

two groups (9,10) of hot flaps aligned with each 
other, the upstream hot flaps of the inner circle being 

articulated at their anterior end (11) on a stationary 
terminal part (2) of the turbojet engine, the cold flaps 

of the outer circle (6) being articulated at their 
anterior end to a bearing cowling structure (4) which is 

radially distant from the stationary terminal part (2), 
characterized 


in that the downstream hot flaps (10) of the inner circle 
(8) are split into two first sets of flaps (14a,14b) 

which are diametrically opposed and into two second sets 
of flaps (15a,15b) which are interspersed between the 

said first sets of flaps (14a,14b), 
in that the flaps of the said first sets of flaps 
(14a,14b) are borne by means of an articulated link (20) 

respectively by two stationary lateral supports (16a,16b) 
arranged between the inner circle (8) and the outer 

circle (6), 
in that the flaps of the said second sets of flaps 
(15a 15b) are borne by means of an articulated link (20) 

by two arched members (17a,17b) pivot-mounted on the said 
lateral supports (16a,16b), 
and in that there are furthermore provided, 

a) means for keeping the anterior end (12) of the 
downstream hot flaps (10) in contact with the rear end of  

 
the upstream hot flaps (9) when the turbojet engine is 

running under normal conditions, 
b) means for pivoting the said arched members 
(17a,17b) and the flaps of the said second sets of flaps 

(15a,15b) backwards together so as to form a thrust 
reverser, the trailing edges (22a,22b) of the flaps of 

the said second sets of flaps (15a,15b) having cutouts so 
as to allow contact between the said second sets of flaps 

(15a,15b) in the "thrust reversal" position and lateral 
exhaust openings (23a,23b) formed between the upstream 

hot flaps (9) and the said second sets of flaps 
(15a,15b), and 
 
in that at least the cold flaps of the outer circle (6) 

which are situated facing the said openings (23a,23b) can 
be retracted in the "thrust reversal" position. 
Nozzle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the retractable cold flaps of the outer circle (6) 

are borne by the said arched members (17a,17b) and are 
driven by these when they pivot backwards. 
Nozzle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cold flaps of the outer circle (6) are split 

into two first parts of flaps which are diametrically 
opposed and borne by the said stationary lateral supports 

(16a,16b) and two second parts of flaps which are borne 
by the said arched members (17a,17b) and driven by these 

when they pivot backwards. 
Nozzle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cold flaps of the outer circle (6) are articulated 

upstream on a ring (25) mounted so that it can 
slide on the bearing cowling structure (4). 
Nozzle according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the ring (25) can slide in the upstream direction. 
Nozzle according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the ring (25) can slide in the downstream direction.
