<CLAIMS>
Sliding bearing, essentially consisting of a plastic 
sleeve, which has a separate press-fit area (2) and 

sliding area (3), where the sliding area (3) has a smaller 
inside diameter than the press-fit area (2), and the 

press-fit area (2) has a larger outside diameter than the 
sliding area (3), characterised in that the press-fit area 

(2) and the sliding area (3) are offset in the axial 
direction and axially separated from one another, the 

press-fit area (2) has an outside diameter roughly equal 
to the inside diameter of the bearing seat, and the 

sliding area (3) is formed by webs (4) essentially 
extending in the axial direction, which rest against the 

shaft and are interconnected in continuous fashion by a 

thin, flexible film in the axial direction. 
Sliding bearing as per Claim 1, characterised in that the 
film is moulded onto the edges of the webs in such a way 

that the inner and also outer periphery of the sliding 
area (3) has indentations (6). 
Sliding bearing as per Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
it comprises several press-fit areas and sliding areas 

mutually separated from one another.
