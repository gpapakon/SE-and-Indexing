transparent plastic material, in one or both of the 
surfaces of which all or a part of a pattern-printed 

layer (2) is embedded, a laminated sheet formed by 
laminating a second substrate sheet (12) formed of a 

transparent plastic material on one surface of the above-mentioned 
sheet, or a laminated sheet formed by

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
process for the preparation of a
decorative sheet
having a three-dimensional effect.A decorative sheet most popularly used for the
production of furniture and construction materials is a
laminate of a pattern-printed plastic sheet and a
transparent plastic sheet. This decorative sheet is poor
in three-dimensional effect and is inevitably cheap in
appearance. US-A-4,449,126 discloses a plastic card having metallic luster relief appearances
comprising a pair of metal-luster plastic sheets containing a metallic-luster
pigment and having a relief pattern of surface concavities and convexities
formed on the surface thereof and transparent plastic sheets respectively laminated
onto the outer surfaces of the metallic-luster plastic sheets.
The plastic card is used for example as identification card, credit card etc. As decorative sheets having a three-dimensional
effect, there are known a sheet formed by pressing resin
chips and a sheet obtained by extruding a resin through
many nozzles, solidifying the extrudate and slicing the
solid. However, these decorative sheets are defective in
that the designs that can be manifested are restricted
and mass production of sheets having the same design is
difficult.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a process for the preparation of a
decorative sheet having a three-dimensional beautiful
design and a process for the preparation thereof.Typical fundamental embodiments of the decorative
sheet obtainable by the process
of the present invention are shown in Figs. 1
through 4. Namely, the decorative sheet of the present
invention includes a sheet comprising a transparent
plastic first substrate sheet 11 and a pattern-printed
layer 2 partially or wholly embedded in one or both of
the surfaces of the first substrate sheet 11 (Fig. 1)
which is formed into a laminate sheet by laminating a transparent plastic
second substrate sheet 12 on one surface of the above-mentioned
sheet 11 (Fig. 2), or by
laminating a plastic third substrate sheet 13 having a 
hiding power one one surface of the above-mentioned sheet 11
or the laminate sheet comprising sheets 11 and 12 (Fig. 3 or 4).Figs. 1 through 4 are sectional diagrams
illustrating basic embodiments of the decorative sheet
obtainable by the process of
the present invention.Figs. 5 through 7 are sectional views illustrating
preferred embodiments of the decorative sheets obtainable by the
process of the present invention.Figs. 8 through 12 illustrate the preparation
process of the present

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a decorative sheet comprising a first
substrate sheet (11) formed of a transparent plastic material and at least

one of a second substrate sheet (12) formed of a transparent plastic
material, and a substrate sheet (13) formed of a plastic material having a

hiding power, which process comprises the following steps:

1) performing buildup printing on one or both of the surfaces of the
first transparent substrate sheet (11) or on one surface of the

second transparent substrate sheet (12) or on one surface of the
substrate sheet (13) formed of a plastic material having a hiding

power, with an ink comprising a curable resin as the vehicle to
form a pattern-printed layer (2);
2) curing the pattern-printed layer (2); and
3) piling the first transparent substrate sheet (11) and one or both of
the second transparent substrate sheet (12) and the substrate

sheet (13) formed of a plastic material having a hiding power and
compressing or heat-compressing the assembly to laminate the

substrate sheets (11;12;13) so that the pattern-printed layer (2) is
embedded in one or two or more of the substrate sheets

(11;12;13).
The process according to claim 1 comprising the following steps:

1) performing buildup printing on one or both of the surfaces of the
first transparent substrate sheet (11) with an ink comprising a

curable resin as the vehicle to form a pattern-printed layer (2);
