<ABSTRACT>
An assembly for mounting circuit cards having high power electrical 
and optical alloy MCM chip devices installed thereon. The assembly has a central 

vertical coolant supply pipe extending from a pump to a heat exchanger unit through 
a refrigeration unit separated from the heat exchanger unit by circuit board mounting 

shelves equipped with electrical and optical backplane apparatus interconnecting 
circuit cards mounted in the mounting shelves. The heat exchanger unit has radiator 

fins separated by vanes extended outward from a hub of the unit and is 
interconnected by return pipes extending through the circuit card mounting shelves 

and terminated in the refrigeration unit which is connected by a return pipe to the 
pump. Vent pipes connected with the heat exchanger vanes extend from the heat 

exchanger unit into circuit card mounting shelves in engagement with mounted 
circuit cards to transfer heat generated by the engaged circuit cards to the heat 

exchanger unit. The vent pipes are displaced to engage heat exchanger connectors 
terminating the vent pipes with circuit card heat sinks when the circuit cards are 

installed in the mounting shelf to effect a transfer of heat generated by the mounted 
circuit cards to the heat exchanger unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit card mounting assembly and in 
particular to a circuit card mounting assembly for interconnecting plug-in circuit 
cards mounting high power electrical and optical components. Electrical and electronic equipment is oftentimes constructed of circuit 
cards mounting components and which are interconnected by a circuit card mounting 
assembly to form the equipment, see for example DE-A-3 244 654. Typically, a circuit card mounting assembly is 
constructed with rows of shelves wherein each shelf is open at the front and arranged 
to receive a number of plug-in circuit cards. The back of each shelf may have 
cabling or printed wiring backplane structures arranged to receive each plug-in 
circuit card and interconnect the received circuit cards to form the electrical and 
electronic equipment. Components mounted on each plug-in circuit card generate heat which 
is required to be dissipated to insure proper operation of the circuit card and other 
circuit cards plugged into the circuit card mounting assembly. In low power 
equipment applications, the shelves may be sufficiently spaced apart to allow the 
component generated heat to dissipate among the shelves without damage to the 
plug-in circuit cards mounted in the circuit card mounting assembly. Higher power 
equipment requires that cooling fans be installed in the circuit card mounting 
assembly to dissipate the component generated heat. In yet higher power equipment, 
cooling mediums are required to circulate throughout the circuit mounting assembly 
and around the mounted circuit cards to cool the circuit card mounted components. A problem arises in that new types of components in addition to 
generating more heat are smaller in size thereby allowing more components to be 
mounted on a circuit card and which causes more heat to be generated by the circuit 
card. Accordingly, a need exists for a plug-in circuit card mounting assembly 
arranged to engage circuit cards as they are inserted into a circuit card mounting 
assembly and transfer the heat generated by the mounted circuit cards to heat transfer 
apparatus of the circuit card mounting assembly which is arranged to dissipate the 
circuit card component generated heat.  
 The foregoing problem is solved by a circuit card mounting assembly as claimed 
intended for use in mounting plug-in types of high power circuit cards and for 
dissipating heat generated by high power components of the mounted circuit cards. 
The assembly has shelves each displaced from the other
