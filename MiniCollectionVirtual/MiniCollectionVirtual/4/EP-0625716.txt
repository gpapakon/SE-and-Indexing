<ABSTRACT>
A sports object flight monitoring system 
including at least one shutterable camera units each 

of which units receive light patterns from each and 
every one of a plurality of contrasting areas on the 

object in rapid successive sequence. A computer 
receives the signals generated by the light patterns 

as received by each camera unit to determine the 
object's flight characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
Ball monitoring devices for using multiple
electro-sensors to determine the angle of launch, spin rate
and speed of sports objects are old (U.S. Patent No.
4,136,387 and 4,158,853).EP 0 554 978 describes a sport object flight
monitoring system including at least two shutterable camera
units each of which receives light patterns from each and
every one of a plurality of contrasting areas on the object
in rapid successive sequence. A computer receives the
signals generated by the light patterns as received by each
camera unit to determine the object's flight
characteristics. US Patent No. 4 136 387 also shows
electro-optical sensors to measure the location of a
plurality of spots on the surface of a golf club head or a
golf ball at a minimum of two precisely spaced points in
time. The two time points for the club head are just prior
to impact with the golf ball. The two time points for the
golf ball are just after impact by the club head. From the
apparent displacements of the plurality of spots between
the measurements the apparatus determines in substantially
real time the velocity of the club head or ball and the
spin about orthogonal axes.Both the above systems employ two or more cameras
or electro-optical sensors where each sensor or camera aims
at only one contrasting area on a ball. Using multiple
cameras or sensors to measure one dot requires that each
camera or sensor is calibrated in relation to the other.
This is difficult to achieve accurately and this affects
the measurements. Moreover, using multiple cameras or
sensors to measure one dot each also requires that each
measurement for each camera or sensor is timed precisely
with respect to the other. The measurement times are of 
the order of between thousandths and millionths of a
second. As a result synchronising the cameras or sensors
to measure at the same time is difficult to accomplish, and
poor synchronisation of the camera's or sensor's
measurement time will also adversely affect the results.
When two cameras or sensors are used the physical
characteristics of each camera, for example, the
orientation of each lens, can vary the results. Since the
measurements are of fractions of inches, any distortion due
to the physical make-up of the system can increase the
error in measurements undesirably.The present invention is intended to overcome some
of the difficulties referred to above by using a single
camera.Broadly, the present invention comprises a portable
system for monitoring the initial flight of an object in
which multiple
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for monitoring the initial portion of the
flight of an object (8') provided with a plurality of

illuminable areas (20 a-f) and which includes a portable
housing (4')

characterized by

(a) a single camera means (18') located in
fixed relationship in said housing (4') and having a light

sensitive panel (18p') focused on a field of view (35)
through which the object (8') passes during the initial

portion of its flight;
(b) means for admitting light into the camera
means (18') at least twice as the object (8') passes

through the field of view (35);
(c) three or more illuminable areas (20 a-f)
on the object (8') positioned so that light emitting from

such areas reaches the light sensitive panel (18p') to form
light patterns (25 a-e) thereon and create analog image

signals when the camera light admitting means is actuated;
and,
(d) computer means (5') in or near said portable
housing (4) for receiving and processing said analog image

signals to determine the path of the object (8'), its speed
and launch angle during the initial portion of flight.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterized in
that said camera light admitting means includes a flash

means (21',22') which emits light in two flashes onto the
obje
ct (8'). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that


(a) said camera means is provided by a single
electro-video unit (18') having a shutter focused on the

object (8') in the field of view (35);
(b) calibration means (30) for calibrating the
illuminable areas (20 a-f) of the object (8');
(c) measuring means in the electro-video unit
(18') which recognize the position of calibrated

illuminable areas (20 a-f) in the field (35);
(d) a plurality of flashing lights (21',22,)
for lighting the field;
(e) control means for opening and closing the
shutter and energizing each light (21',22') such that each

light illuminates the object in the field when the object
is at a first position (A) and when it is at a second

position (B);
(f) light receiving means (18p') in the
electro-video unit for receiving light from the illuminable

areas (20 a-f) when the object is at the first position (A)
and at the second position (B); and
(g) computer means (5') in or near the housing
for comparing the calibrated illuminable areas positions at

the first position (A) with such illuminable areas at the
second position (B).
Apparatus as claimed in any one of preceding claims
1 to 3 characterised in that it has six illuminable areas

(20 a-f). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that all the various means, except the

computer means (5') and support means for said object (8'),
are located in the portable housing (4').
