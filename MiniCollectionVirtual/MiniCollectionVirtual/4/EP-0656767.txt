<ABSTRACT>
A process for regenerating articular cartilage (10) in a joint (20) including the steps of exposing the joint (20) having a cartilage defect (30), debriding the entire cartilage layer (10) to the underlying bone-cartilage interface, to expose a plurality of vascular sinusoids in the sub-chondral layer of bone (15) adjoining the joint surface, restoring the smooth contour and topography of the joint to its natural state, surgically closing the joints, and injecting a single dosage of a mixture of purified growth hormone and buffer solution into the joint so as to initiate the regenerative process, said mixture containing a quantity of purified growth hormone (somatotropin) which has been dissolved in a buffer solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for
regenerating articular cartilage surface which has
been damaged, destroyed, or has otherwise become
defective, thereby alleviating pain, stiffness, and
other difficulties associated with a defective
articular cartilage surface in a joint.Articular cartilage, the thin, fragile tissue
layer covering the ends of bones, allows healthy
joints to move freely and without pain. Many
arthritic diseases and many degrees of trauma can,
however, cause destruction or deterioration of this
fragile layer, leading to pain, joint stiffness, and
even crippling. From ancient times until the present,
it has commonly been believed that this fragile
surface, once lost, could never be restored. Attempts
made in the past to regenerate or otherwise repair
articular cartilage have been failures, thereby
directing medical science to the development of
substitutes and abandoning the potential for
regeneration. Many substitutes have been developed to
replace the articular cartilage joint surfaces, and
these substitutes require implantations by surgery.
Earlier substitutes included fascial transplants or
transplants of entire joints such as the knee;
however, the majority of these transplants were
failures. More recently, medical science has
developed implants which utilize metal and plastic
components, but these are very costly because of the
complicated implant components, the prolonged and 
repeated hospitalizations required for the surgical
implantation of the components and the long periods of
rehabilitation. In addition, many cases require one
or more revision surgeries to replace defective, loose
or infected implants. Most often, full motion and
full activity are not achieved with the use of these
implants. Further, the general discomfort associated
with utilizing such implants makes an alternative
method all the more desirable.The prior art includes GB 2 261 672 relating to
a bone cement mixture used to promote cartilage
repair.The biological action of somatotropin acting in
this process has been the subject of the applicant's
research. The use of growth hormone in this manner is
novel; heretofore, growth hormone has always been used
clinically to enhance the growth of children with
short stature. Somatotropin may have other effects on
other organ systems but in the instant patent, the
specific actions of somatotropin related to cartilage
growth which have been identified by Dunn's research
are utilized herein. The major targets of
somatotropin activity for cartilage

<CLAIMS>
Use of purified growth hormone in the manufacture of a medicament to
regenerate articular cartilage.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the purified growth hormone initiates stem
cell layer growth at the sub-chondral layer.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the purified growth hormone attracts
pleuripotential stem cells to the vascular sinusoids in the sub-chondral layer of bone.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the purified growth hormone stimulates the
production of stem cells in marrow and the vascular sinusoids located at the sub-chondral bone.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the purified growth hormone produces
multiple vascular sinusoids in the sub-chondral layer.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the purified growth hormone:

(i) stimulates the production of stem cells in marrow and sub-chondral bone;
(ii) attracts pluripotential stem cells to the sub-chondral layer of bone; and
(iii) initiates stem cell layer growth at the sub-chondral layer.
Use of purified growth hormone in the manufacture of a medicament for
regenerating the articular cartilage of a joint wherein the damaged articular cartilage

of the joint has been surgically removed so as to restore a smooth contour and expose
a plurality of vascular units or single lumen vessels at the sub-chondral layer.
Use according to claim 7 wherein the joint surface has been further surgically
contoured to restore the natural contour of the joint. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the medicament is for
animal use.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the medicament is for
human use.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the growth hormone is
dissolved in a buffer solution, preferably wherein the buffer solution is Hank's Buffer

Solution having a pH range of between 8.0 and 8.3.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein a range of about 1.0 to
1.5 milligrams of said purified growth hormone is dissolved in 1 millilitre of said buffer

solution, the total amount of said dosage being dependent upon the weight of the
individual subject being injected.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the growth hormone is
species-specific so as to be identical to a growth hormone naturally produced by the

individual subject being injected.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the growth hormone is
biologically engineered to assure maximum purity and disease elimination.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the growth hormone is
administrable in a single dosage form, and wherein said single dosage is about 0.25 to

0.75 milligrams of purified growth hormone per kilogram of body weight of the
individual subject being injected.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the growth hormone is
administrable by periodic and repeated injections.
Use according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the growth hormone is to
be administered by an intra-articular injection. 
Use according to claim 17, wherein the growth hormone:

(i) produces additional articular cartilage surface thickness;
(ii) improves the quantity and quality of existing cartilage; and
(iii) produces additional crystal clear joint fluid.
