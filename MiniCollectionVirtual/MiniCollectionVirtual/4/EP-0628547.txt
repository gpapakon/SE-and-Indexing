A process for preparing the pyridone of the 
formula I 


 
which comprises 


a) in a first step, reacting a C
1
-C
4
-alkyl cyanoacetate 
with hydrazine in water as reaction medium to form 

a cyanoacetic hydrazide, then 
b) in a second step, treating the as-synthesized cyanoacetic 
hydrazide with benzoyl chloride in the 

presence of a buffer system to form an B-benzoylcyanoacetic 
hydrazide, and thereafter 
c) in a third step, reacting the as-synthesized 
N-benzoylcyanoacetic hydrazide with a C
1
-C
4
-alkyl 
acetoacetate in the presence of both a base and a 

phase transfer catalyst. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein steps 1 
to 3 are each carried out at from 0 to 50Â°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, in step 

1, the C
1
-C
4
-alkyl cyanoacetate and hydrazine are reacted 
in a molar ratio of from 1:1 to 1:3. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, in step 
2, from 1 to 1.5 mol of benzoyl chloride are used, based 

on 1 mol of C
1
-C
4
-alkyl cyanoacetate in step 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, in step 
3, 1 to 3 mol of C
1
-C
4
-alkyl acetoacetate are used, based  
 

on 1 mol of C
1
-C
4
-alkyl cyanoacetate in step 1.
