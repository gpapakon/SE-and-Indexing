<ABSTRACT>
A bi-directional buffer (94) includes first (100) and second (102) unidirectional buffers connected for retransmitting signals in opposite directions between first and second buses. When an external bus driver pulls the first bus low, the first unidirectional buffer (100) pulls the second bus low and generates a signal inhibiting the second unidirectional buffer from actively driving the first bus. When the external bus driver allows the first bus to return to the high logic level, the first unidirectional buffer (100) temporarily supplies a high charging current to the second bus to quickly pull it up. Similarly, when an external bus driver pulls the second bus low, the second unidirectional buffer (102) pulls the first bus low and generates a signal inhibiting the first unidirectional buffer from actively driving second bus. When the external bus driver allows the second bus to return to the high logic level, the second buffer (102) temporarily supplies a high charging current to the first bus to quickly pull it up.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
electronic systems and in particular to a system
for flexibly interfacing the various components of
an electronic system.Many electronic systems employ field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), such as those
manufactured by Xilinx Inc., to reconfigure
selectively system component interconnections for
various modes of system operation. A typical FPGA
includes several input and output ports and a
network of logic gates interconnecting the input and
output ports wherein the logic gates respond to
signals at the input ports by generating signals at
the output ports. The FPGA also includes a number
of memory cells that store data transmitted thereto 
from an external source such as a computer. The memory
cells control switching states of various gates in the
FPGA. By appropriately loading data into the memory
cells, the computer can configure the FPGA in order to
generate an output signal at any given port that is a
selected logical combination of states of input signals
at one or more of the input ports. Thus, the FPGA may
be used for selectively routing signals between system
components and may also be used to perform various
logic operations on the signals.While programmable FPGAs are very useful, they
have some limitations. All input/output signals must
be unidirectional, and all signals must be of the same
logic level. Thus the FPGAs cannot be connected to bi-directional
buses and cannot interface differing types
of devices such as CMOS and TTL devices.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an apparatus for providing
an interface between a first port signal at a first
port terminal and a second port signal at a second port
terminal, in alternative modes selected by input
control data, the apparatus comprising: first driver
means, receiving a first input signal and a second
input signal, for driving said first port signal to a
first logic state in response to assertion of said
first input signal and for driving said first port
signal to a second logic state in response to assertion
of said second input signal; second driver means,
receiving a third input signal and a fourth input
signal, for driving said second port signal to a third
logic state in response to assertion of said third
input signal and for driving said second port signal
to a fourth logic state in response to assertion of
said fourth input signal; first single-shot means,
receiving said first input signal, for asserting and
then deasserting said second input signal
