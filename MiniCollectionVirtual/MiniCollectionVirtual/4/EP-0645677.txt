<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an operation-condition
display system for a photographic processing
system, and more particularly to an operation-condition
display system for use in such a
photographic processing system as includes an
automatic film developing device for developing an
exposed photographic film and a printing device for
printing an image of the developed film on a
photosensitive material such as a print paper.Conventionally, the automatic film developing
device includes a display means which is operable to
display operation conditions of the automatic film
developing device.The display means displays such information as
concerning which processing step the film is presently 
experiencing, or concerning a temperature and an
amount of developing liquid in use.In use, an operator of this automatic film
developing device appropriately judges and confirms,
through the display means of the automatic film
developing device, whether a new film developing
process is possible or not or whether any abnormality
has developed in the temperature or amount of the
developing liquid or not. Then, depending on the
necessity, the operator effects a film exchange or
some other maintenance operation.On the other hand, the photographic processing
system of the above-described type is to be normally
operated by a single operator. And, for setting of
particular printing conditions with respect to the
print paper in use, the operator usually has to devote
most of his/her operation time for the photographic
processing to the operations of the printing device.Accordingly, when necessary, the operator has to
interrupt the operation of the printing device and
then to move to the location where the automatic film
developing device is installed, so as to check the
operation condition displayed on the display means of
this automatic film developing device.With the conventional system construction, even 
if the automatic film developing device is installed
in the vicinity of the printing device, the operator
has to interrupt the operation of the printing device
and then to move to the location of the developing
device for the sole purpose of checking the operation
condition of the developing device, rather than
actually operating this automatic film developing
device. Accordingly, the operation efficiency of the
photographic processing is deteriorated.Moreover, in many actual situations, it is
impossible to reserve a good amount of inter-installing
space between these devices, so that the
automatic film developing
