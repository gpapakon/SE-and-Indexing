<ABSTRACT>
A control (1) for an engine of a motor vehicle contains a computing component (2) by means of which measured values which represent operational variables of the engine (e.g. the intake air temperature) are detected and evaluated and control signals for actuators which act on the operation of the engine (e.g. control the injection of fuel) are produced. The control 1 has an operating system which simplifies the management of operations which are to be initiated in a time-dependent manner. It includes a first time monitoring for operations whose activation is to be tested at short time intervals (e.g. diagnostic communication), and a second time monitoring for operations whose activation is to be tested at long time intervals (e.g. measurement of the intake air temperature and coolant temperature, heating of the  lambda  probe heater etc.).

Method for controlling an engine, having an 
arithmetic unit (2) by means of which measured values 

which represent operational variables of the engine are 
acquired and evaluated in a program-controlled way and 

control signals for final controlling elements which act 
on the operation of the engine are generated, having an 

operating system which controls the acquisition and 
evaluation and the generation of control signals, by 

means of which operating system different kinds of 
programs are activated in a time-dependent way, the 

operating system specifying a time control having the 
following time monitoring: 


a first time monitoring for actions whose respective 
activation time is to be checked at brief intervals of 

time, and 
a second time monitoring for actions whose respective 
activation time is to be checked at long intervals 

of time, the first time monitoring including a time job 
list (19), characterized in that in the time job list 

(19) each time job is entered at a list location (0,..., 
n), and in that the time job to be entered contains an 

address of an action, an item of status information and 
a time at which the action is to be activated. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the first time monitoring 

manages jobs whose execution or activation has to take 
place within a few system time-slot patterns, and in that 

the second time monitoring manages jobs whose execution 
or activation lasts for a greater number of system time-slot  

 
patterns. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the system time is subdivided 

into a pattern with a time unit of 10 ms. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the first time monitoring 

includes an address list for the actions to be carried 
out and a table of the cyclical times. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the time entered is 

compared at every program run with the contents of a 
counter which shows the present system time, and in the 

event of correspondence the actions assigned to the time 
job are triggered. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the second time monitoring 

contains a time job list (24) in which the time jobs are 
stored, and an address list (25) in which the starting 

addresses of the actions which are assigned to the 
individual time jobs are stored. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 6, characterized in that the time jobs are arranged 

in ascending chronological order in the time job list 
(24), and in that this order is realized by means of 

links which specify the connections between the individual 
time jobs. 
Method for controlling an engine according to 
Claim 6, characterized in that, at every call which takes 

place in the system time-slot pattern, the time management 
interrogates in each case only the first job in the 

time job list (24) to determine whether it is being 
executed.
