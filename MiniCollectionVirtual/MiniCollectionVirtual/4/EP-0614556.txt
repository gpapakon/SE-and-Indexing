<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in the 
form of a portal positioned along a pathway for reading a 
transponder type device or tag attached to an object moving 
along the pathway through the portal. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a portal reading 
arrangement for reading a preferably passive transponder 
type device or tag which is excited by an inductively 
coupled magnetic field of a first predetermined frequency to 
produce a magnetic and/or an electrostatic field of a second 
predetermined frequency modulated with a coded identifying 
signal which is inductively received and decoded by a 
receiver. Proximity type systems generally operating in 
this manner are disclosed for exam le in commonly owned U.S. 
patent 4,818,855 and US-A-5099227, 
filed December 18th, 1989. It is known to use systems of the above general type 
for the identification of objects moving along a pathway, 
for example, a conveyor belt or an animal walkway, for the 
purpose of identifying and/or controlling the movement of 
the object along the pathway as a result of the readout 
identification. In such systems, the transponder type 
device or tag is generally affixed to the object with a 
known orientation and position, and one or more readers are 
positioned along the pathway, for example above, below 
and/or to the side of the pathway, depending on the desired 
or known orientation of the tag on the object. While these 
systems operate satisfactorily when the orientation and/or 
position of the tag on the object is generally known, 
reading problems may occur if the tag is randomly oriented 
or randomly positioned. These reading problems may be 
caused for example because the tag has not been excited to 
produce an output signal, or because the output signal 
received by the receiving antenna is too weak. These  
 
problems generally occur because of the directional nature 
of the coupling mechanisms involved, and in particular the 
inductive magnetic field coupling used to excite the 
transponder or tag and/or to provide the received output 
signal. Additional reading problems can result due to the 
size, and thus the positioning of the tags relative to the 
readers, and/or due to the material from which the object is 
formed. For example, in the case of a metal object with a 
random orientation, the tag may be effectively shielded from 
the reading devices. One type of pathway or conveyor system wherein 
automatic reading of tags affixed to objects moving along 
the conveyor would be
