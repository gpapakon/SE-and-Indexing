<ABSTRACT>
A holding device (1) for receiving a laboratory apparatus (2) which laterally has a protective frame or rail-like projections is preferably constructed as a holder fork having two parallel holder arms (3), the holder arms (3) at their end having upright projections (4) for engaging into the lateral rails of the laboratory apparatus (2) or other recesses. Furthermore, at a distance from these projections (4), the laboratory apparatus (2) is overlapped by an overlapping projection (7) belonging to the holding device (1) so that the laboratory apparatus (2) cannot slip or fall off from the holding device (1). Special holder screws or similar fixing means which are complex to operate are not required and, despite this, the laboratory apparatus (2) is securely located but it can also be taken off from the holding device (1) in a very simple manner.
