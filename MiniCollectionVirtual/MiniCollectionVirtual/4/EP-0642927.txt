<ABSTRACT>
A water-base ink fixing composition for use in fixing a water-base image. The composition contains a clay 
interlayer compound and an ion exchanger such as an ion exchange resin. It may contain a water absorbing resin and 

a thermally fusible resin as a binder. A thermally transferred image covering film is formed by removably forming on 
a substrate a water-base ink fixing layer consisting of the water-base ink fixing composition. A binder layer or a layer 

of a thermally fusible resin may be formed on a water-base ink fixed layer. A thermally transferred image covering 
film is formed by laminating any one of a water-base ink fixing layer, a binder layer and a layer of a thermally fusible 

resin on a thermally transferred image or a protective layer-carrying thermally transferred image in an opposed state 
and thermally pressing them against each other, whereby the water-base ink fixing layer is transfer-laminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition for fixing water-color
ink for forming a protective coat of a thermal transfer
image, particularly a sublimation heat transfer image. This
invention also relates to a cover film for thermal transfer image
using the composition for fixing water-color ink and a thermal
transfer image recorded medium.Recently, a so-called "instant video portrait system" has
been known, which is a system utilizing a sublimation transfer
recording technique. This system operates by imaging an object
with a video camera, then thermally transferring the video
picture information as a static image onto a dye receptor layer
of printing paper with the sublimation transfer recording
technique, and using the resulting transfer image for various
certificates. Thus, this system has been noted as a substitute
of the conventional silver salt photography. For instance, this
"instant video portrait system" has been adapted in Europe for
specifying users of a ski pass or a railroad pass. Such a thermal transfer image formed on the
printing paper may be used in the exposed state for
a variety of purposes. However, it is a prevalent
practice to stack a cover film for thermal transfer
image on the thermal transfer image for protecting
it. The cover film for thermal transfer image can
be exemplified by a polyester film having an
adhesive layer formed thereon or a polyvinyl
chloride film which can be stacked by thermo-compression
bonding of itself.In some cases, a water-color ink image, such as an
overlapping seal or various stamped images, may be
formed by using a water-base ink employing a water-soluble
dye or briefly water-color ink on the
thermal transfer image formed on the printing
paper.However, since the dye receptor layer of the
printing paper in which the thermal transfer image
is formed is made of a lipophilic or water
repellent material, such as polyester, the dye
receptor layer does not absorb or is not penetrated
by the water-color ink. Therefore, the dye receptor
layer does not fix the water-color ink image
therein.Also, since the conventional thermal transfer image
cover film is made of a lipophilic material as
described above, the cover film does not absorb or
is not penetrated by the water-color ink, and 
therefore does not fix the water-color ink image
therein. Thus, the water-color ink image formed on
the thermal transfer image is easily destroyed by
any contact with water dropping due to rain or
perspiration or by rubbing by hand.US-A 4,613,525 discloses an ink jet recording
