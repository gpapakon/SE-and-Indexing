<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum tank assembly (10) has a low volume configuration so 
that it can be used in boats and recreational vehicles where 

space is at a premium. A stack of components, with a waste 
tank (13) at the bottom, then a vacuum tank (14) with directly connected 

vacuum pump (15), and one or more fresh water tanks (16,17), is located 
remote from a vacuum toilet (11), with a discharge from the toilet 

(below a vacuum-tight ball valve) connected to the vacuum 
tank (14), which is in turn connected to the vacuum pump (15), in turn 

connected to the waste tank (13). A submersible centrifugal pump (26) 
may be provided mounted to a cap of the water tank (16,17), with an 

anti-siphon device associated with it. The vacuum tank (14) is of 
high density polypropylene having flat walls, with no 

continuous flat surface more than 80 square inches. Lipless 
duckbill check valves are provided on opposite sides of the 

vacuum pump (15), the valves of elastomeric material having a ratio 
of the wall thickness to thickness of the sealing edges of 

about 1:1. The waste tank (13) may have a dip tube with a dog leg 
portion having a large cross-sectional are oval bottom opening 

to minimize the possibility of clogging.

<DESCRIPTION>
Portable toilets are the most commonly used type of
toilet in recreational vehicles and boats because of the
minimum amount of space they require. However despite the
better space utilization conventional portable toilet
assemblies provide, they take up too much space for small
vehicles and boats.According to the present invention, a vacuum toilet
assembly is provided which takes up a minimum of space so that
it can fit in vehicles and boats where vacuum toilets were
previously impractical, and an assembly which also provides
minimum water usage. For example the toilet itself has a
width of between 35.56 and 38.1 cm (14 and 15 inches), a length of 45.72 to 50.8 cm (18 to 20
inches), and a height of 27.94 to 40.64 cm (11 to 16 inches). The ball valve for
connecting the vacuum tank to the toilet during flushing is
less than 6.35 cm (2.5 inches) in diameter (e.g. 5.08 cm (2 inches)) rather than
the conventional 7.62 cm (3 inches). While the amount of water usage
will depend upon how long the discharge valve associated with
the toilet is operated, typically a 9.4625 - 11.355 L (2.5-3 gallon) sized water
tank is sufficient to normally accommodate four adults for a
period of 9-10 hours, who are expected to generate waste which
will approximately fill a 18.925 L (5 gallon) waste tank; a water pump
may deliver water to the toilet at a rate of no more than 7.57 L (2
gallons) per minute. Also, the vacuum tank, waste tank, and
water tanks can be vertically stacked so that they take up no
more space than is typically provided in a hanging locker or
closet, and the vacuum pump and vacuum tank may be combined in
a single module for optimum space saving.The waste tank is also relatively small in size, e. g. 18.925 L (5
gallons, and may have a dip tube and vent which allow -- in
combination with the particular connection of the vacuum pump
thereto -- the tank to be readily pumped out, and to allow
discharge from the tank if the tank is full.The plastic vacuum tank also is provided in a low volume
configuration since it has flat sides, and is mounted directly 
to and nested with the vacuum pump, the flat sides having a
wall thickness to deflection ratio which allows a non-cylindrical
construction of the vacuum tank. The particular
connection of the vacuum pump with respect to the vacuum tank
and waste tank avoids conventional macerating pumps (which
consume electricity at such a rate as to make them impractical
for small boats or RV spaces), eliminates the need for a large
waste tank by using vacuum to convey waste
