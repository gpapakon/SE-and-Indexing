<ABSTRACT>
Material is conveyed on a belt coveyor which is 
wound around a pair of end rollers (23) which comprises front (2) 

and rear (3) end rollers which are rotatably mounted to front (A2) 
and rear (A1) frames. An intermediate frame (A3) is provided 

between the front and rear frames (A1,A2). At least one of the 
front and rear frames (A1,A2) is adjustably connected to the 

intermediate frame (A3) so as to change an angle with respect 
to the intermediate frame, thereby facilitating its 

installation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a belt conveyor 
in which an endless conveyor belt is wound around a pair 
of rollers rotatably mounted to a frame and rotated to 
convey material by drive means provided on the frame, and 
especially to a belt conveyor in which material held 
between a conveyor belt and a press belt is conveyed in a 
substantially vertical direction. Figs. 6 to 8 illustrate a conventional belt 
conveyor, in which depending on the situation of supply 
and discharge sides of material to be conveyed, there is 
provided a frame such as Z-shape on which there are 
provided a plurality of rollers for guiding a conveyor 
belt 1 and a press belt 8. The conveyor belt 1 which 
comprises an endless flat belt is wound around a front end 
roller 2 driven by a motor (not shown); a rear end roller 
3; and intermediate guide rollers 4, 5, 6 and 7. The endless flat press belt 8 is wound around the 
guide rollers 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and runs in a 
direction of an arrow with frictional force by overlapping 
it on the conveyor belt 1 between the guide rollers 4 and 
5. In the guide rollers 9, 10, 11 and 12, the guide 
roller 9 is a front end sub-roller, and the guide roller 
12 is a rear end sub-roller. Between the rear end roller 3 and the guide roller 
4, there is provided a horizontal supply portion 13 of the 
conveyor belt 1; a vertical transfer portion between the 
guide rollers 4 and 5 of the belts 1 and 8; and a 
horizontal discharge portion 15 between the guide roller 5 
and the front end roller 2 of the conveyor belt 1. The belts 1 and 8 at the transfer portion 14 are 
alternately pressed by a plurality of horizontal short 
press rollers 16 supported on the frame "X" at a certain 
distance, and a back surface of forward path of the  
 
conveyor belt 1 is pressed by a plurality of horizontal 
short pressure rollers 17 which are rotatably mounted on 
the frame at a certain distance. In the belt conveyor, granular or powdered 
material 19 is thrown down onto the supply portion 13 of 
the conveyor belt 1; is put into the belts 1 and 8 via the 
guide roller 4; is elevated in a substantially vertical 
direction; and is discharged into a hopper 20 from the 
discharge portion 15 in which the belts 1 and 8 are 
opened. The belts 1 and 8 are pressed by the press roller 
16, thereby preventing the transferred material 19 from 
leakage through the space between the belts 1 and 8. 
Pressing the conveyor belt 1 by the pressure rollers 
prevents the conveyor belt 1 from moving rearwards, and 
prevents the

<CLAIMS>
A belt conveyor in which an endless belt is wound 
around a pair of end rollers which comprises front and 

rear end rollers rotatably mounted to front and rear 
frames respectively, an intermediate frame being provided 

between the front and rear frames, the conveyor belt being 
rotated to convey material, characterized in that; 

   at least one of the front and rear frames is 
adjustably connected to the intermediate frame so as to 

change an angle with respect to the intermediate frame. 
A belt conveyor as defined in claim 1 wherein 
there is provided a press belt which is partially 

overlapped on the conveyor belt so that the material may 
be held and conveyed between the conveyor and press belts, 

the press belt being wound around a pair of end rollers 
which comprise front and rear end sub-rollers rotatably 

mounted to the front and rear frames respectively. 
A belt conveyor as defined in claim 1 or 2 wherein 
the intermediate frame comprises a pair of parallel links 

which are connected to the front and rear frames so as to 
form a parallelogram link. 
A belt conveyor as defined in any of claims 1 to 3 
wherein a guide roller for guiding a bent portion of the 

conveyor belt is provided on at least one of the front and 
rear frames. 
A belt conveyor as defined in claim 4 wherein at 
least one of the front and rear frames is rotatably 

mounted to the intermediate frame with a pivot axis which 
is the same as an axis of the guide roller for guiding the 

conveyor belt.
