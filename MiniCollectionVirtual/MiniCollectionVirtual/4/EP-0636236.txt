<ABSTRACT>
A cold box (10) has a cooling container thermally insulated all around with a chamber (11) for the goods to be cooled. The cooling container consists of a bottom (12) and of an openable and closable cover (13), which preferably accommodates part of the reception chamber (11). The cold box (10) further has a preferably thermoelectrically operated cooling unit run by an electric current supplied by an external source. The cooling unit is arranged in a sidewall of the cold box (10), in an additional chamber (17) located between the outer enveloping wall (12C) of the bottom (12) and the part of the heat insulating layer (12A) of the bottom (12) located towards the chamber (11). In order to accommodate the components required for the cooling unit in the narrow available space, the cover (13) has a third chamber (17A) for the components required to operate the cooling unit. The third chamber (17A) is located in the area of the sidewall of the cold box (10) which receives the cooling unit, between the enveloping wall (13C) of the cover (13) and the part of the heat insulating layer (13A) of the cover (13) adjacent to the chamber (11). The parts of the heating insulating layer (12A and 13A) of the bottom (12) and cover (13) adjacent to the additional chambers (17 and 17A) are substantially flush. The heat insulation of the reception chamber for the goods to be cooled is thus not affected.
