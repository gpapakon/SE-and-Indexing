<ABSTRACT>
In a plasma vapor deposition reactor for depositing an 
electrically insulating material using a DC sputtering 

process the plasma is stabilized, maintaining its 
sputtering efficiency, by provision of a secondary anode 

(22), preferably held at a positive bias with respect to 
the primary anode (15). The secondary anode (22) is 

shielded from exposure to the stream of sputtered material, 
yet situated close enough to the plasma discharge to 

attract electrons from the plasma to maintain its charge 
balance. In reactive sputtering, the sputtering chamber 

(10) contains both a sputtering gas, for example argon, and 
a reactive gas, for example oxygen. Positive ions of the 

sputtering gas bombard a target (17) of the material to be 
sputtered. Atoms of the target material, the sputtered 

atoms, are emitted from the target (17) in all directions 
into the chamber (10), some of them falling on the 

substrate surface to be sputter coated. At the surface or 
in the chamber (10) they chemically combine with the 

reactive gas. In the instance to which this invention 
applies, the chemical combination forms an electrically 

insulating coating on the substrate (19). The same 
electrically insulating material coats all other surfaces 

exposed to the flux of sputtered atoms. In an embodiment of 
the invention the positively biased secondary anode, being 

shielded from the sputtered atoms is not coated by the 
electrically insulating material, thus maintaining its 

ability to draw electrons from the plasma.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the plasma vapor deposition of a 
layer of an electrically insulating material on a substrate 
by reactive sputtering. More particularly the inventive 
method and apparatus permits the sputter coating to be done 
using a DC plasma discharge. Sputter coating is a widely used technique for depositing a 
thin film of material on a substrate. In one form of this 
technique, known as DC sputtering, positive ions from a 
plasma discharge formed between an anode and a target 
cathode are attracted to and strike the target, dislodging  
 
or sputtering atoms from the target surface. Some of the 
dislodged atoms fall on the surface of the substrate and 
form a coating. In reactive sputtering a gaseous species is 
also present at the substrate surface and reacts with, and 
in some embodiments combines with, the atoms from the 
target surface to form the desired coating material. This 
material is also deposited on any other surface exposed to 
the sputtered atoms. It is recognized in the prior art that 
if the coating is an electrically insulating material, such 
as a metal oxide, the build up of the material on other 
parts of the sputtering apparatus can cause problems. In 
particular, the build up of an insulating coating on the 
anode interferes with the ability of the anode to remove 
electrons from the plasma, as required to maintain the 
plasma's charge balance. This destablizes the plasma and 
interferes with controlled deposition. As a result, it is 
common to use a different sputtering technique, RF 
sputtering, to deposit layers of insulating materials. 
However, RF sputtering is a less efficient, less 
controllable and more expensive process than DC sputtering. Pinarbasi met this problem when trying to deposit layers of 
hydrogen-containing amorphous silicon. His work was 
published as a 1989 doctoral thesis for the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign entitled "Growth, Properties 
and Electrical Stability of DC Magnetron Reactive Sputtered 
Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon Thin Films" and in Thin solid 
Films, 171 (1989) Pp. 217-233. To reduce this effect, 
Pinarbasi shielded the anode with a positively biased anode 
shield to carry the electron current from the plasma. This 
reduced the problem enough to permit deposition of the 
experimental films. (See especially Page 220). 
But a poorly understood transient effect, reported by 
Pinarbasi, indicates that the problem was not completely 
under control. This problem could seriously impact long 
term use of this process,
