<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns heterocyclic compounds which are useful
in inhibiting squalene synthase, processes for their preparation and
pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The present invention is
also concerned with methods of using such heterocyclic compounds in
treating diseases and medical conditions where inhibition of squalene
synthase is desirable, for example in treating diseases or medical
conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.Several different classes of compounds have been reported to
possess the capability of being able to lower cholesterol levels in blood
plasma. For example agents which inhibit the enzyme HMG CoA reductase,
which is essential for the production of cholesterol, have been reported
to reduce levels of serum cholesterol. Illustrative of this class of
compounds is the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor known as lovastatin which is
disclosed in US Patent No 4,231,938. Other agents which are reported to
lower serum cholesterol include those which act by complexing with bile
acids in the intestinal system and which are hence termed "bile acid
sequestrants". It is believed that many of such agents act by
sequestering bile acids within the intestinal tract. This results in a
lowering of the levels of bile acid circulating in the enteroheptatic
system and promoting replacement of bile acids by synthesis in the liver
from cholesterol, which synthesis results in an upregulation of the
heptatic LDL receptor and thus in a lowering of circulating blood
cholesterol levels.Squalene synthase (also referred to in the art as squalene
synthetase) is a microsomal enzyme which catalyses the first committed
step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Two molecules of farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP) are condensed in the presence of the reduced form of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to form squalene.
The inhibition of this committed step to cholesterol should leave
unhindered biosynthetic pathways to ubiquinone, dolichol and isopentenyl
t-RNA. Elevated cholesterol levels are known to be one of the main risk 
factors for ischaemic cardiovacsular disease. Thus, an agent which
inhibits squalene synthase should be useful in treating diseases and
medical conditions in which a reduction in the levels of cholesterol is
desirable, for example hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.Thus far, the design of squalene synthase inhibitors has
concentrated on the preparation of analogues of the substrate farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP), and hence on compounds which contain phosphorus
