<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for producing home-made filter cigarettes consisting of a) a cigarette paper tube with filter tip, b) a tobacco cartridge which is prefabricated by an operation in which it is cut from a tobacco strand, and a tobacco portion which is open at the end, corresponds to the tobacco filling of a finished cigarette and can be introduced into a cigarette paper tube, its outer surface consisting of a wrapping of completely smokable material which is impermeable to air so that it cannot be smoked as such but can be consumed by smoking after being introduced into the cigarette paper tube, which system is characterised in that the length L2 of the tobacco cartridge (2) is greater than the length L1 of the cigarette paper tube (8), so that a smokable filter cigarette is obtained either (a) only after one end of the tobacco cartridge (2) has been introduced into the cigarette paper tube and the introduced tobacco cartridge has subsequently been cut to length and severed at the length Lv desired by the consumer, which may be equal to or less than the length L1 of the cigarette paper tube (8), or (b) only after the tobacco cartridge (2) has been cut to length and severed at the length Lv desired by the consumer, the cut-to-length and severed end of the tobacco portion has subsequently been introduced into the cigarette paper tube and, if appropriate, the end of the cigarette paper tube which remains unfilled has subsequently been shortened, when Lv is less than L1.
