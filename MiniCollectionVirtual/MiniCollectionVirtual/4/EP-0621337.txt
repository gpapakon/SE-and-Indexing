<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides for the 
construction of a codon optimized DNA sequence 

encoding the insect-specific toxin 
Androctonus
australis
 
insect toxin (AaIT). The codon optimized 

sequence is then inserted into an insect virus. A 
susceptible insect which ingests such a modified 

insect virus will cease feeding on plants due to a 
toxin-induced paralysis at an earlier time than an 

insect which ingests a wild-type insect virus 
lacking an AaIT gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the construction 
of a codon optimized DNA sequence encoding the 
insect-specific toxin AaIT, to the expression of 
that toxin, and the demonstration of invivo 
toxicity of insect viruses encoding that toxin. The following abbreviations are used 
throughout this application: 
A. cal. -AutographacalifornicaAcMNPV -Autographacalifornica nuclear polyhedrosis 
virus AaIT -Androctonusaustralis insect toxin bp -base pairs CPU -contractile paralysis unit ECV -extracellular virus GV -granulosis virus kD -kilodaltons LT -lethality time MOI -multiplicity of infection NPV -nuclear polyhedrosis virus OB -occlusion body Occ- -occlusion negative virus(es) Occ+ -occlusion positive virus(es) PCR -polymerase chain reaction PDV -polyhedron derived virus PFU -plaque forming unit  p.i. -post-infection PIB -polyhedron inclusion body (also known as OB) ST -survival time    The family of DNA insect viruses known as 
Baculoviridae includes nuclear polyhedrosis viruses 
(NPV) and granulosis viruses (GV). These viruses 
produce occlusion bodies (OBs) in their life cycle. 
Also included are the non-occluded viruses (NOV), 
which do not produce OBs in their life cycle. 
Another family of DNA insect viruses are the 
entomopox viruses. Over 400 baculoviruses have been 
identified as present in invertebrates. Examples of 
NPVs include Lymantriadispar NPV (gypsy moth NPV), 
Autographacalifornica MNPV, Syngraphafalcifera NPV 
(celery looper NPV), Spodopteralitturalis NPV, 
Spodopterafrugiperda NPV, Heliothisarmigera NPV, 
Mamestrabrassicae NPV, Choristoneurafumiferana 
NPV, Trichoplusiani NPV, Helicoverpazea NPV, etc. 
Examples of GVs include Cydiapomonella GV (codling 
moth GV), Pierisbrassicae GV, Trichoplusiani GV, 
etc. Examples of NOVs are Orcytesrhinoceros NOV 
and Heliothiszea NOV. Examples of entomopox 
viruses include Melolonthamelonotha EPV, Amsactamoorei 
EPV, Locustamigratoria EPV, Melanoplussanguinipes 
EPV, Schistocercagregaria EPV, Aedesaegypti 
EPV, Chironomusluridus EPV, etc. The use of baculoviruses and entomopox 
viruses as bioinsecticides holds great promise. One 
of the major impediments to their widespread use in 
agriculture is the time lag between initial 
infection of the insect and its death. This lag can 
range from a few days to several weeks. During this 
lag, the insect continues to feed, causing further  
 
damage to the plant. A number of researchers have 
attempted to overcome this drawback by inserting a 
heterologous gene into the viral genome, so as to 
express an insect
