<ABSTRACT>
The pipe pressure mediator has a pipe-shaped stiff housing and a thin-walled, pipe-shaped sleeve (30) made of a metallic material, which is welded into the housing and, together with the latter, bounds a chamber for receiving a filling liquid. In the case of an unloaded sleeve, that is to say pressure equivalence between the interior of the sleeve and the chamber, the sleeve has a circular ring-shaped cross-section profile. In operation the chamber is held continuously under a pressure which is so much greater than the pressure in the interior of the sleeve that the sleeve (30) is locally indented radially inwards. Pressure changes in the interior of the sleeve enlarge or reduce this indentation, so that an operating volume of the filling liquid is drawn into the chamber or an operating volume of the filling liquid is pressed out of the chamber.

Pipe pressure intermediary device comprising a 
tubular, rigid casing (2) and a thin-walled, tubular 

sleeve (30) which is made of metallic material, is 
arranged inside the casing (2) and at both its ends is 

fluidtightly fastened to the casing (2), the interior of 
the sleeve (30) forming a measuring chamber (44) to 

receive a substance which is to be measured and the 
pressure of which acts from the inside on the sleeve 

(30), while between the outer surface (40) of the sleeve 
(30) and the inner surface (24) of the casing (2) a 

chamber (42) is formed which is intended to receive a 
transmission fluid, which chamber (42) can be connected 

to an apparatus responding to pressure, characterized in 
that when equality of pressure exists between the measuring 

chamber (44) and the chamber (42) the sleeve (30) has 
a circular annular cross-sectional profile in the region 

of the chamber (42), and in that in the region of the 
chamber (42) the sleeve (30) can be elastically deformed 

by a relatively higher pressure in the chamber (42) than 
in the measuring chamber (40) in such a manner that 

because of the deformation the volume of the chamber (42) 
is greater than when equality of pressure exists. 
Pipe pressure intermediary device according to, 
Claim 1, characterized in that the casing (2) is provided 

at each of its ends with a respective circular cylindrical 
contact surface (28) for contact with the two ends of 

the sleeve (30), and in that the two ends of the sleeve 
(30) have a circular cylindrical outer surface (34, 36). 
Pipe pressure intermediary device according to  
 

Claim 2, characterized in that when equality of pressure 
exists between the measuring chamber (44) and the chamber 

(42) the outer surface (40) of the sleeve (30) has in the 
region of the chamber (42) a larger diameter than the 

outer surfaces (34, 36) of the ends of the sleeve (30). 
Pipe pressure intermediary device according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that when equality of pressure 

exists between the measuring chamber (44) and the chamber 
(42) the outer surface (40) of the sleeve (30) has in the 

region of the chamber (42) a smaller diameter than the 
outer surfaces (34, 36) of the ends of the sleeve (30). 
Pipe pressure intermediary device according to 
one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the sleeve 

(30) is made of a metal sheet which is bent into a 
circular cylinder and which is welded along a generating 

line of the circular cylinder at two of its edges. 
Pipe pressure intermediary device according to 
one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the wall of 

the sleeve (30) has regions having different tensile 
strengths. 
Pipe pressure intermediary device according to 
one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that in the region 

of the chamber (42) the inner surface (24) of the casing 
(2) has a circular cylindrical shape. 
Measuring arrangement comprising a pipe pressure 
intermediary device having a chamber (42) filled with a 

transmission fluid, an apparatus (48) which has a second 
chamber likewise filled with the transmission fluid and 

indicates the pressure of the transmission fluid in the 
second chamber or responds otherwise to this pressure, 

and a connecting pipe (46) which maintains communication 
in respect of flow between the first and second chambers, 

characterized in that the pipe pressure intermediary 
device is constructed in accordance with one of Claims 1 

to 7, and in that during operation the transmission fluid 
is continuously held under a pressure, up to the nominal 

pressure of the measuring arrangement, higher than the 
pressure of the substance to be measured contained in the 

measuring chamber (44) of the pipe pressure intermediary  
 

device. 
Measuring arrangement according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the transmission fluid is held 

under a pressure such that the latter elastically deforms 
the sleeve (30) in the region of the chamber (42) in such 

a manner that the cross-sectional profile of the sleeve 
(30) differs from the circular annular shape. 
Measuring arrangement according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the chambers of the measuring 

arrangement which are filled with the transmission fluid 
form a system which is closed against the outside and in 

which the mass of the filling fluid enclosed therein is 
constant during operation.
