<ABSTRACT>
In a power converter, the inverter device casing (20) 
and a heat receiving plate (18a, 18b) are insulated, and the 

heat receiving plate (18a, 18b) and a filter capacitor (7) 
are connected through a predetermined inductance. Since 

higher-harmonic current is bypassed to the filter capacitor 
(7) through a resonance filter which is constructed of the 

electrostatic capacity in a switching element and an inductance, 
induction trouble, which might otherwise be caused by 

higher-harmonic current leaking to the outside of an inverter 
device, can be reduced by a simple construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power converting
device and, more particularly, to a reduction of an
induction trouble of the same.In the prior art, there has been a problem that a
higher harmonic component issued from an inverter
reaches an induction motor and flows over the body of an
electric car through a stray capacity between the
armature winding of the induction motor and the motor
frame to exert an adverse effect such as a malfunction
upon a signal device on the ground. In the technique,
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 193001/1992,
the power line of an electric motor, through which
the higher harmonic current will flow, is accommodated
in a conductive duct so as to prevent the higher
harmonic current from flowing to the car body, so that
the magnetic flux may be eliminated by connecting the
motor frame electrically with the conductive duct and by
using this duct as a feedback passage for the higher
harmonic current.In the prior art described above, however, the
higher harmonic current to leak to the car body cannot
be decreased either to a sufficient extent.This is because the electric motor or a heavy
component having a weight of several hundreds Kg is 
mounted on the truck of the electric car by means of bolts or
the like so that the higher harmonic current will leak to the
car body through those bolts and the truck.Thus, there has been caused by the higher harmonic current
flowing through the car body a problem that the signal
device on the ground or on the car is adversely affected.DE-A-2 624 567 discloses a power converting device comprising
a pair of serially connected switching elements,
wherein a cooler is thermally connected to one of said
switching elements through an insulator. Moreover, said
cooler is insulated from a casing accommodating said power
converting device and is connected to the zero potential
point of the input side of said power converting device.EP-A-0 590 502 presenting an Art. 54(3) EPC document describes
a three level power converting device in which a casing
of the device is electrically connected to a cooler of
switching elements.The present invention has been conceived in view of the
above-specified problems and has an object to reduce the adverse
influence due to the higher harmonic current generated
by a power converter, with a simple construction.This object is met by a power converting device according
to claim 1. Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the
depending claims.In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the present
invention
