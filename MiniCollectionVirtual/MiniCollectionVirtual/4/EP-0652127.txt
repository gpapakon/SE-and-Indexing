<ABSTRACT>
The device includes a main pipe (16) and two secondary pipes (20A,20B) for drawing up fuel joined together by a branch piece (18), the free ends of the secondary pipes forming fuel uptake orifices, a fuel flow splitter (36) which can be moved inside the branch piece (18) parallel to an axis of alignment of the connection ends of the secondary pipes (20A,20B) between two extreme positions of maximum shutting-off of one or other of the secondary pipes (20A,20B), and means (38) for moving the splitter (36) as a function of a force acting on the reservoir in order to move the fuel towards one of the uptake orifices so that the fuel flow rate coming from the other of the uptake orifices is lower than that coming from the first.

Device for drawing up fuel from a tank (10) of a
motor vehicle, of the type comprising


two intake orifices (22A, 22B) connected to means of
pumping the fuel and disposed in the vicinity of the

bottom of the tank (10) and being separated from one
another,
a main pipe (16) and two secondary pipes (20A, 20B)
for the intake of fuel connected with each other by a

junction (18), the free ends (22A, 22B) of the secondary
pipes (20A, 20B) forming intake orifices for the fuel, a

fuel flow distributor (36) which is displaceable, inside
the junction (18), in a direction parallel with an axis

of alignment of the connection ends of the secondary
intake pipes (20A, 20B) and substantially parallel with

the alignment of the two intake orifices (22A, 22B),
between two extreme positions of maximum obturation of

one or other of the secondary intake pipes (20A, 20B),
and means (38) of displacing the distributor (36)
according to a force acting on the tank which displaces

the fuel towards one of the intake orifices (22A, 22B) in
such a way that the fuel flow coming from the other of

the intake orifices (22B, 22A) is lower than that coming
from the first one,

   
characterized in that
 the distributor (36) is made
from a ferrous material, the means of displacing the

distributor (36) comprising a rocker arm (38) disposed
outside of the junction (18), mounted in a pivoting

manner about an axis (X) substantially perpendicular to
the alignment of the intake orifices (22A, 22B), in

stable equilibrium in its vertical position, this rocker
arm (38) comprising one end disposed in the vicinity of

the junction (18), provided with a magnet (54) such that
the displacement of the rocker arm (38) under the effect

of the force acting on the tank (10) causes, by magnetic
attraction, the displacement of the distributor (36) in 

the direction opposite to that of the said force.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the connection ends of the secondary intake pipes

(20A, 20B) have circular internal cross-sections, and in
that the distributor (36) comprises a disk (40) fixed at

its centre onto a rod (42) whose ends, on either side of
the disk, are slidingly mounted in bearings (44, 46)

having openings to allow the passage of the fuel, fixed
in the connection ends of the secondary intake pipes

(20A, 20B).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that each intake orifice (22A, 22B) is surrounded by

an enclosure (24A, 24B) connected with the rest of the
tank (10) forming a fuel reserve, and in that it

furthermore comprises a main pipe (28) for delivering
unconsumed fuel connected by a junction (30) to two

secondary fuel delivery pipes (32A, 32B) in such a way as
to distribute this fuel in the secondary delivery pipes

(32A, 32B) with substantially equal flow rates, the
secondary fuel delivery pipes (32A, 32B) comprising free

ends emerging, inside the enclosures (24A, 24B), in such
a way as to supply the latter with fuel whatever may be

the force applied to the tank (10).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the secondary (20A, 20B)

and main (16) fuel intake pipes are connected with each
other by a T-junction.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the secondary (32A, 32B)

and main (28) fuel delivery pipes are connected with each
other by a T-junction.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the intake orifices (22A,

22B) are surrounded by strainers (26A, 26B) intended to
filter the fuel.
