<ABSTRACT>
Significant reductions in the cost of 
fabrication of epitaxial semiconductor devices without 

sacrifice of functional characteristics is achieved 
by eliminating the conventional but costly polishing 

procedure, instead subjecting the substrate to 
grinding, cleaning and etching processes in which the 

grinding removes material from the surface to a depth 
of at least 65 microns and the etching further removes 

material to a depth of about 6-10 microns, the 
grinding preferably being carried out in two steps, 

the first being a coarse step and the second being a 
fine step, with the rotated grinding elements dwelling 

at their respective last grinding positions for a 
short period of time. The result is the equivalent 

of the prior art polishing procedure which took 
considerably longer to carry out and which therefore 

was much more costly. Complementing this grinding 
procedure is an improved and cost effective epitaxial 

process utilizing a unique two-step hydrochloric gas 
high temperature etch and a faster growth rate process 

with shorter cycle steps. In addition, oxygen control 
and "gettering" capabilities result in a total process 

improving the economics of formation of 
epitaxial semiconductor devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
method of fabricating epitaxial semiconductor devices 
on a substrate, which method is much less costly than 
prior art polishing methods, yet which results in 
devices functionally the equal of those conventionally 
produced. Silicon epitaxial layers are conventionally 
grown on a mirror-like polished surface, thereby to 
produce the desired damage-free epitaxial layer. To 
produce such a polished surface is expensive and 
labor intensive, but the polishing procedure has 
nevertheless been for some time the conventional 
procedure despite its economic drawbacks. Many steps 
are required to obtain the prior art mirror-like 
polished surface. Industry standard steps that evolved  
 
include saw slicing, mechanical lapping, cleaning, 
edge rounding, caustic etch, another cleaning, followed 
by a multi-step, chemical and mechanical, polishing, 
with a final cleaning step before packaging. The 
polished surfaces thus produced are very prone to 
damage by handling or otherwise. Grinding of substrates is, of course, known. 
Backside grinding of the substrate is conventionally 
carried out to reduce overall thickness of silicon 
wafers. However, so far as is known, the use of 
grinding to produce the desired mirror-like surfaces 
of epitaxial devices has not been practiced in the 
past. In accordance with the present invention, 
the conventional back-side grinding process has been 
modified, and other fabrication steps have been employed 
and adjusted, in order to produce the desired optimum 
mirror-liKe surface on the wafer in but a fraction of 
the time previously required when polishing was employed. 
With mechanically polished devices the overall process 
time for the substrate is about two days, but with the 
process here disclosed only about one hour of processing 
time is involved. Polishing alone, in the prior art, 
has taken one to two hours, whereas the grinding in 
the present process takes but two to four minutes. The 
grinding is followed in the present process by an 
etching step, but that etching step takes only about 
nine minutes. Hence the time comparison of the present  
 
process as compared to the polishing process involves 
the comparison between eleven minutes and one to two 
hours. The consequent fabrication cost reduction is 
obvious. It is the prime object of the present 
invention to devise a process for the formation of 
epitaxial semiconductor devices on a substrate which 
will be less time consuming and costly than prior art 
methods yet
