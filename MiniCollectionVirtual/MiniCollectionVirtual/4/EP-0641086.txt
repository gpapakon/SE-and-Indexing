<ABSTRACT>
The interrogation device is used for operating control switches (S) arranged in groups, with a resistance network (R) providing a characteristic voltage drop signal upon operation of one of the operating controls, supplied via an A-D converter to an evaluation control device (ST). The signals provided via the operating controls of each group are fed to a signal shaper (CP1,CP2), coupled to a further input (11,12) of the control device (ST).

Device for the interrogation of operating elements (S)
of an electrical appliance which are combined to form

operating element groups, in which, as the result of
actuating an operating element (S), a characteristic signal

in the form of a voltage drop is produced across a resistor
network (R) for each of the operating elements (S) actuated

in an operating element group, which voltage drop is
quantified by an analogue/digital converter (AD) and is

evaluated by a control unit (ST), and the signal produced
by the operating elements (S) of each operating element

group is applied to a signal shaper (CP1, CP2) and the
signals of the operating element groups are fed to the

analogue/digital converter (AD) via a resistor (Rx), a
diode or a voltage divider in each case, characterized in

that the output signals of the signal shapers (CP1, CP2)
are each fed to an input (I1, I2) of the control unit (ST),

in that resistor networks (R) and operating elements (S)
are disposed in an operating section and the control unit

(ST), the analogue/digital converter (AD) and the signal
shaper (CP) are disposed in a main section of the

electrical appliance, as a result of which a minimum number
of connecting lines between operating section and main

section is necessary, and in that the resistance values of
the resistors of the resistor network (R) have the same

ohmic value.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that a
microprocessor having at least one interrupt input (I) and

at least one integrated analogue/digital converter (AD) is
provided as control unit (ST).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that comparators, transistors or Schmitt triggers are used

as signal shapers (CP).
