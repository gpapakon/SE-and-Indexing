<ABSTRACT>
Improvements to electrical connector housings comprising a socket (female housing) element (2) and a plug (male housing) element (1), characterised in that the plug element (1) includes an inclined elastic blade terminal (8) fastened, at an intermediate point along its length, to a stop (18), whereas the socket element has a passage (20) intended to accommodate the elastic strip (8) and, at an intermediate point on the former, is extended by a projection (21) located on the path of the stop (18) and having, facing the side of the opening of the socket element (2), an abrupt feature (21a) connected at right angles to a part (21b) which is itself connected at right angles to a retaining abrupt feature (21c) intended to ensure, together with the stop (18), that the two housing elements are locked together.

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector housing of the type comprising a 
female housing component (2) having an opening for the 

introduction of a male housing component (1), these two 
components being intended to receive electrical 

connection members to be connected, the said housing 
being provided with a so-called "throat" system enabling 

the male component (1) to be engaged completely and 
automatically locked when the male housing component has 

been inserted as far as a determined position in the 
female housing component (2), the said male housing 

component (1) comprising a resilient bar (8) extending 
laterally, parallel to the direction of introduction of 

the male component in the female component (2) and 
integral, by one end (8
b
), with the male housing 
component and, by the other end (8
a
), with a pillar (7) 
situated in the vicinity of the end (9) of the male 

housing component (1) intended to be engaged in the 
female component (2), these said resilient bar (8) 

comprising at an intermediate point of its length, a stop 
(18), whereas the female housing component has a passage 

(20) intended to receive the resilient bar (8) and, at an 
intermediate point of which, a shoulder (21) situated on 

the path of the stop (18) extends,
characterised in that
 the resilient bar (8) is inclined 
towards the end of the male housing component (1) 

opposite that intend to be inserted into the female 
housing component (2), the stop (18) assuming the shape 

of a substantially parallelepipedic block, whereas the 
shoulder (21) has, turned towards the side of the opening 

of the female housing component (2), a steep face (21
a
) 
connected at right angles to a part (21
b
) itself 
connected at right angles to a steep retention face (21
c
) 
intended to ensure with the stop (18) the mutual locking  

 
of the two housing components, in such a manner that, 

when the male housing component (1) is introduced into 
the female housing component (2), the stop (18), by 

cooperating with the shoulder (21), brings about a 
bending of the resilient bar (8), so that the end of the 

stop (18) passes beneath the part (21
b
) of the shoulder 
(21) situated between the two steep faces and that, when 

the surface of the stop (18), cooperating with the angle 
connecting the part (21
b
) situated between the two steep 
faces and the steep retention face (21
c
), the force of 
reaction of the resilient bar (8), tending to return to 

its initial shape, brings about a complete engagement of 
the said male housing component (1) in the female housing 

component (2). 
An electrical connector housing, according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 in the vicinity of its end (8
b
) 
adjacent to the end (11) of the male housing component 

(1) opposite that intended to be engaged in the opening 
of the female housing component (2), the resilient bar 

(8) is integral with a rib (16), the free end of which is 
integral with a transversal bar (15) connected by two 

resilient lugs to the corresponding end of the male 
housing component.
