<ABSTRACT>
Machine for security printing on security papers, particularly bank notes, comprising a paper-feed device (1), a paper-transportation device and a unit (19) for applying optically variable images supplied by at least one tape which is brought into contact with the paper such that these images are applied at specific locations on the paper corresponding to printing (impressions) on security papers. The application unit (19) includes at least one activator roll (11) interacting with a pressure roll (20) and between which the paper passes through. The tape is mounted between two reels which are arranged in a sector of the applicator roll (11) and the tape passes along a generatrix of the said applicator roll, perpendicularly to the path of the paper, under the action of a servomotor acting intermittently at each application step.

<CLAIMS>
A machine for security printing on security papers, 
especially bank notes, including a device for feeding with 

paper, especially in the form of sheets (1), a device for 
transporting the paper and a unit (19) for applying 

optically variable images (12) supported by at least one 
tape (13) which is brought into contact with the paper, 

such that these images are applied at defined locations on 
the paper corresponding to the printing marks on security 

papers, the application unit (19) including at least one 
applicator cylinder (11) interacting with a pressure 

cylinder (20), the paper moving along between said 
cylinders, characterized in that said tape (13) is mounted 

between two reels (15, 15') fixed to the applicator 
cylinder (11) and in that the tape passes along a 

generatrix of said applicator cylinder, perpendicularly to 
the path of the paper, under the action of a servomotor 

acting intermittently at each application step. 
The machine as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that said tape (13) is mounted in a single cassette (14) 

comprising the two reels, at least the major part of said 
cassette (14) being arranged inside said applicator 

cylinder (11), preferably in a sector thereof, the useful 
length of the cassette corresponding to the length of the 

applicator cylinder (11) which, itself, corresponds to the 
width of the paper to be printed, that is to say to their 

dimension taken in the direction perpendicular to their 
movement. 
The machine as claimed in claim 2, characterized 

in that the cassette (14) is arranged inside a sector of 
the applicator cylinder (11).  

 
The machine as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the major part of the cassette (14) is arranged 

inside a sector of the applicator cylinder (11) and 
extends beyond said cylinder laterally on at least one 

side and/or diametrally. 
The machine as claimed in claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the applicator cylinder (11) 

includes a plurality of adjacent sectors each equipped 
with a cassette (14). 
The machine as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that, in the case of use of the paper in the form of 

sheets on which the printing marks on security papers are 
arranged in columns and rows, the number of sectors 

corresponds to the number of rows of printing per sheet. 
The machine as claimed in claim 6, characterized 
in that two applicator cylinders (11, 11') are provided, 

mounted in series and acting alternately on the same 
sheet, the number of sectors and of cassettes of each 

cylinder being such that the sum of the two numbers is 
equal to the number of rows of printing per sheet. 
The machine as claimed in claim 6, characterized 
in that the cassettes are set in pairs in diametrally 

opposed sectors of said applicator cylinder (11) and apply 
alternately, after one half-revolution of said applicator 

cylinder, a series of images (12) to a row of printing on 
two successive sheets. 
The machine as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that, upstream of the unit (19) for applying the image, 

there is provided a unit (3) for applying adhesive 
imprints to the paper at locations intended to receive 

said image (12), followed, if required, by a drying 
device, especially one drying by ultraviolet.  

 
The machine as claimed in claim 9, characterized 
in that the adhesive is a two-component adhesive, one 

component being applied by said application unit (3), 
whereas the second component is on the background of said 

image (12). 
The machine as claimed in either of claims 9 and 
10, characterized in that the unit (3) for applying the 

adhesive furthermore comprises a printing unit, especially 
a letterpress printing unit (8) enabling a security image 

to be printed, the two units having a common impression 
cylinder (7).
