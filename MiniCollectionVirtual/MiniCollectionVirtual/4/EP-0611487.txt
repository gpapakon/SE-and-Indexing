<ABSTRACT>
A switch for transmitting a signal with gain from one of a plurality of input transmission lines (10A, 10B, 10N) to a common output line (14) is described which achieves high isolation by omitting the transmission line between the output matching section and the junction of the input and the output. In one embodiment the output of each amplifier, a field effect transistor (38, 40), is coupled directly to a common output (34) and the output matching circuitry is also omitted from the input lines, there being provided a common output matching and bias network located in the output line. In another embodiment the output matching network (26a, 26b; 64a, 64b) is coupled directly to the common junction (16; 56) and the transmission line length between the output matching network and the junction is omitted for each input line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high isolation
switch arrangement in which at least
two input lines are connected to a common output line
at a common junction, each input line having an
input matching and bias network and the output of the
input matching and bias network being connected to the
input of an amplifying means provided by a single-gate
field effect transistor (FET), the output of the FET
being coupled to the input of an output matching network
and the output of the output matching network
being connected to said common junction, each FET
being biased such that one of the two or more inputs on
said input lines can be switched to the common output,
each FET being biased 'on' to provide high gain or
'off' to provide isolation.Moreover, the present invention relates to a
method of isolating a signal passing through an
input line with gain, termed an 'on' line, from other input
lines which are off, termed 'off' lines, the method
comprising the steps of:
providing at least two input lines coupled to a common
junction, and an output line also coupled to said common
junction, each of said input lines having a matching and
bias network, amplifying means provided by a single-gate
field effect transistor (FET) coupled to the output of said
input matching and bias network, and an output matching and
bias network, the output of the matching and bias network
in each input line being coupled to said common junction;
andbiasing each FET so that it can be switched between an
'on' and an 'off' state, wherein in the 'on' state the FET
provides high gain and in the 'off' state provides
isolation.In a switch in wich a single output line is
switched to one or more input lines, it is desirable that
the switch performs such that cross channel isolation
complies with the highest possible standards or projected
standards. At the present in the United States a cross
channel isolation standard of 27 dB. has been proposed and
this is over the frequency range 11.7 - 12.2 GHz. This
means that when one polarisation is on and the other
polarisation is off, the isolation between polarisations
is at least 27 dB.A transmission line switch is disclosed in published
UK Patent Application No. GB2220538A to Marconi which
allows a single output line to be switched to one or more
input lines to which it is permanently connected at a
common junction. In the switch disclosed in this
application each input line has an associated amplifier
stage which can be biased in a normal high gain (on)
state, or in an isolation (off) state. The

<CLAIMS>
A high isolation switch arrangement in which at least
two input lines (10) are connected to a common output line

(14) at a common junction, each input line (10) having an
input matching and bias network (20) and the output of the

input matching and bias network (20) being connected to the
input of an amplifying means provided by a single-gate

field effect transistor (FET) (24), the output of the FET
being coupled to the input of an output matching network

(26) and the output of the output matching network (26)
being connected to said common junction (16), each FET (24)

being biased such that one of the two or more inputs on
said input lines (10) can be switched to the common output

(14), each FET being biased 'on' to provide high gain or
'off' to provide isolation, characterised in that in the

'off' state biasing is such that the FET is pinched-off
whereby the FET in conjunction with the output matching

network provides high impedance at the junction to allow
the 'on' and 'off' paths to be joined at the common

junction with minimal loss introduced into the 'on' path,
and in that the output of each output matching network (26)

is connected to said common junction (16) via a
transmission line (28) having a length equal to zero or a

multiple number of half wavelengths of a signal being
transmitted.
An arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the input
matching networks (26) each include biasing means. 
An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
transmission line (28) includes DC blocking means whereby

an 'on' FET (24) is biased to provide a positive voltage on
the output and an 'off' FET(s) (24) is biased to provide a

zero or minimal voltage on the output.
An arrangement according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the FETs (24) are high electron mobility

transistors (HEMT).
A method of isolating a signal passing through an
input line with gain, termed an 'on' line, from other input

lines which are off, termed 'off' lines, the method
comprising the steps of:


providing at least two input lines coupled to a common
junction, and an output line also coupled to said common

junction, each of said input lines having a matching and
bias network, amplifying means provided by a single-gate

field effect transistor (FET) coupled to the output of said
input matching and bias network, and an output matching and

bias network, the output of the matching and bias network
in each input line being coupled to said common junction;

and
biasing each FET so that it can be switched between an
'on' and an 'off' state, wherein in the 'on' state the FET

provides high gain and in the 'off' state provides
isolation,
the method being characterised by the steps of biasing
a FET in the 'off' state such that the FET is pinched-off

to provide, in conjunction with the output matching 
network, high impedance at the common junction to allow the

'on' and 'off' paths to be joined at the common junction
with minimal loss introduced into the 'on' path and

connecting the output of each output matching network to
the common junction via a transmission line having a length

equal to zero or a multiple number of half wavelengths of
a signal being transmitted.
