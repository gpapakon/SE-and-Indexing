<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker has a pole (6) and a surrounding magnet (3) which together define an annular gap (7). A voice coil (12) supported on a tubular former (8) is disposed within the gap (7) as is a conductive skirted dome (13). The dome (13) is supported upon an insulating gasket (14) providing three arcuate points of support and a phase plug (16) extends through a central opening (15) in the dome (13). The dome (13) and phase plug (16) are preferably separated by a second gasket (27) which may or may not be bonded to both and the phase plug (16) suitably includes an integral born (20) extending beyond the former (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a loudspeaker 
incorporating an inductively coupled tweeter 
particularly, but not necessarily only, for use in an 
automotive audio system and starts from EP-A-0'344'975. A loudspeaker conventionally comprises a magnet 
assembly with an annular gap having a radial magnetic 
field within the gap. A voice coil is suspended in the 
magnetic field by means which permit it to be moved 
axially without touching the sides of the magnet 
assembly. The voice coil is wound on a rigid tube that 
is connected to a diaphragm, the outer edge of which is 
flexibly supported by a frame that is itself securely 
attached to a part of the magnet assembly. However, with 
this type of loudspeaker the frequency range of the 
sound produced is limited to low and medium frequency 
and, in order to reproduce high frequency sounds, it is 
proposed to incorporate an inductively coupled tweeter. Inductively coupled tweeters in loudspeakers are 
known. For example, GB 545712 discloses an inductively 
coupled conductor in the form of a radiating dome 
positioned in the magnetic gap inside the main voice 
coil of a loudspeaker. The low and medium frequency 
sounds are radiated by a conventional cone, the high 
frequency sound is produced by the dome and is 
directionally controlled by a special horn fixed to the  
 
centre pole. In U.K. Patent No. 2118398 a similar arrangement is 
disclosed where a radiating dome is positioned over the 
central pole and supported by an annular suspension 
means. The dome is positioned within the tube or former 
supporting the voice coil and receives its energizing 
signals inductively from the voice coil. The dome is horn 
loaded by the same diaphragm as the voice coil, but 
reproduces high frequency sound. More recent proposals are contained in European 
Published Applications 0344974 and 0344975. European 
Publication 0344974 is an improvement on the loudspeaker 
disclosed in GB Patent No.2118398 and includes a fixed 
element providing phase correction, which is supported 
by the pole through a hole in the dome. The radiating 
dome is supported by an annular flexible suspension on 
the pole face and also by another smaller flexible 
suspension on the underside of the phase correcting 
device. This provides two small sealed chambers. On the 
free end of the former there is a flared extension which 
is designed to provide a smooth acoustic impedence 
transition. European Publication No. 0344975 discloses a similar 
electro acoustic transducer as disclosed in GB Patent 
No.
