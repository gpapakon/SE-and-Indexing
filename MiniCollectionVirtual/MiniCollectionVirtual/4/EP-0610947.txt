<ABSTRACT>
Work station for production lines which is provided in particular for use in vehicle construction. To avoid expensive attachments on each skid or on a multiplicity of skids used in a production line, one or more work stations are provided in this production line. According to the invention, the work station has a disc rotating about its longitudinal axis and accommodating at least two skids one after the other, in which arrangement direct acceptance and transfer from and to the existing conveyor system takes place. The work station can be integrated in drying, cooling, ventilating/vaporizing and buffer sections of a production line.

<CLAIMS>
Work station for paint finishing lines in vehicle construction, in which the
workpieces (6) held substantially on multipart transport units (2) are moved by means of a

conveying system (1, 1') from one finishing section (F1, F2, F3) to a further finishing
section (F1, F2, F3) and through these, wherein the work station (3) has a rotatable rotor

(3b), which is provided with at least two holding fixtures (3c) arranged concentrically to its
body longitudinal axis (3h) and constructed for holding a respective transport unit (2) or

parts thereof together with a workpiece (6) placed thereon, characterised in that

a) the rotor (3b) is rotatable about its substantially horizontally fulcrumed body
longitudinal axis (3h), and
b) the work station (3) has positioning means (8) in a defined rotational position of the
rotor for taking over and transferring the workpiece (6) between the transport unit (2) and

the holding fixtures (3c) of the work station (3).
Workstation according to claim 1, characterised in that the positioning means is a
lifting beam (8).
Workstation according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the respective
workpiece (6) is placed on the holding fixtures (3c) to be held by means of individual,

uncouplable connecting members (2', 2'') of the transport unit (2).
Workstation according to claim 3, characterised in that the connecting members (2',
2'') are arranged under the workpiece (6) within the base area thereof.
Work station according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that heating,
cooling or ventilating sets or devices (7) are provided directly or indirectly outside the

circumferential circle (5), which is described by the outer edge of the workpiece (5), and
preferably within the booth (3n).
Work station according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that at least in part
heating, cooling or ventilating sets or devices (7) are arranged directly at the rotor (3b) or

the holding fixtures (3c) and oriented to one or more of the held workpieces (6).
