<ABSTRACT>
A selective adsorbent for cellular fibronectin (cFN) utilizing a nonwoven cellulose sulfate fiber fabric, and a method of separation 
and purification of FN in which an FN-containing material containing plasma fibronectin (pFN) and the cFN is 

brought into contact with the non-woven fabric to separate the pFN from the cFN. According to this method, the cFN can be separated 
from the pFN efficiently by a simple operation, and high purity pFN and cFN can be recovered at a high yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selective 
adsorbent for cellular fibronectin (cFN) and a technology 
for fractional purification of fibronectin (FN), 
particularly a method for fractionating an FN matter 
containing both plasma fibronectin (pFN) and cFN into pFN 
and cFN and a method of hemocatharisis comprising 
eliminating cFN from blood by the above method. Fibronectin (FN) was first reported by Morrison 
et al. [Morrison, P. R. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 70, 
3103 (1948)] as one of plasma proteins in 1948. Being a 
multifunctional protein broadly distributed in various 
tissues and body fluids, this substance is known to be 
involved, as a cell adhesion factor, in a large variety 
of biological events such as the migration, 
differentiation, proliferation and canceration of cells 
[Sekiguchi, K.: Cell Engineering, 4 (6), 485-497 (1985)]. Meanwhile, FN as it is synthesized in the liver 
and occurring in the blood is known as plasma FN (pFN), 
and FN as it is detected on the tissue and cell surfaces  
 
is called cellular FN (cFN) [Sekiguchi et al., J. Biol. 
Chem., 260 (8) 5105-5114 (1985)]. It has been shown that 
these species of FN are subject to molecular diversity 
due to alternative splicing of the early gene 
transcription product. As the regions subject to such 
alternative splicing, there are three regions called EDA, 
EDB and IIIcs, and it is believed that a large number of 
molecular species occur according to varied combinations 
of expression of these regions. In pFN, the above-mentioned 
EDA and EDB regions have not been appreciably 
expressed. On the other hand, cFN is an FN with a high 
degree of expression of said EDA region. Peters J. H. et 
al. conjugated a peptide having 29 amino acids with 
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to prepare an immunogen, 
constructed an anti-cFN polyclonal antibody specifically 
reactive to cFN having the EDA region, and using the 
antibody, demonstrated that the normal human blood 
contains traces of cFN and that the blood cFN level is 
markedly elevated in patients with collagen disease 
accompanied by vasculitis [Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 138, 
167-174 (1988); J. Lab. Clin. Med., 113 (5), 586-597 
(1989)]. According to the above report of Peters et al., 
the physiological implications of increased blood cFN in 
patients with collagen disease accompanied by vasculitis 
are not definitely known but a correlation between the  
 
stage or severity of disease and the blood concentration 
of cFN is suggested. The investigation made by the inventors of the
