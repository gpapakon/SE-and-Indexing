<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vulcanizable
compositions of nitrile rubbers which contain an
organic carbonate as plasticizer.Nitrile rubbers (NBR rubbers) are products of the
copolymerization of 1,3-butadiene and acrylonitrile,
generally having an acrylonitrile content within the
range of 15 to 50% by weight. According to the known
art, these rubbers are formulated with plasticizers,
cross-linking agents, normal fillers and additives and
subjected to vulcanization to give end-products whose
characteristics widely depend on the composition of the
NBR rubber. In particular, in vulcanized products the
values of resistance to liquid fuels and solvents, and
the resistance to abrasion and permeability of gases,
increase with the increase of the acrylonitrile
content. On the other hand, with a decrease in the
acrylonitrile content the characteristics at low
temperature and resilience improve. These vulcanized
products are consequently used in technological fields
which require high performances, such as the car 
industry, the manufacture of gaskets, piping and oil
seals. For a review of NBR rubbers, their production,
formulation and vulcanization, reference can be made to
Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Ed.
1982, Vol. 8, page 184 onwards and Vol. 20, page 365
onwards.The functions of the plasticizers used in
vulcanizable compositions of NBR rubbers basically
consist in increasing the performance of the formulate
at low temperatures, improving the workability in
relation to the different transformation and moulding
techniques, lowering the cost of the formulate, in that
the addition of the plasticizer enables a greater
quantity of fillers to be incorporated, and modifying
the resistance to solvents of the vulcanized products.A group of plasticizers, for general use, which
are suitable for the purpose, is that of dialkyl esters
of phthalic acid. When specific characteristics are
required, aliphatic plasticizers are used, which are
relatively more valuable, such as the dialkyl esters of
adipic acid, sebacic acid (for example di-2-ethylhexylsebacate,
DOS) and azelaic acid, or the polymeric
esters of said acids, in particular adipic acid,
especially when vulcanized products are required which
are particularly resistant and impermeable to the
action of oils and solvents.The disadvantage of the above plasticizers 
basically consists in their high cost and consequently
the necessity is felt in the art for more economical
plasticizers.It has now been found, in accordance with the
present invention,
