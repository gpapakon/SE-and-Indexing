<ABSTRACT>
A railcar moving vehicle (10) having a hydraulic system for raising 
the vehicle 

coupler (17) while coupled to a railroad car or the like to transfer 
weight from the railcar (30) to 

the vehicle. By this invention, fluid pressure in the hydraulic power 
line is sensed, to 

monitor an increase in the fluid pressure as the hydraulic system 
raises the vehicle 

coupler (17) while coupled to a railcar (30). Then, when a substantial 
termination of the increase 

in fluid pressure is sensed as the hydraulic coupler (17) is raised, an 
indicator signals the 

occurrence of this event, typically by automatically terminating the 
hydraulic raising of 

the vehicle coupler (17). Thus, weight may be transferred without 
overraising the railcar (30), 

without the need for estimating the weight of the railcar (30) prior to 
the weight transfer process.

<DESCRIPTION>
Railcar moving vehicles having a weight transfer capability have been sold the 
railroad industry for years, being of a design which is typified for example by White 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,497,257; 4,537,137; and 4,380,198; and Lich et al. U.S. Patent No. 
4,878,436, among others. These railcar moving vehicles typically are too light to effectively pull a loaded 
railcar without significant wheel slippage. Therefore, a weight transfer mechanism is 
provided, in which the coupler of the railcar moving vehicle, which connects to the 
railcar, may be driven upwardly, typically by hydraulic cylinders. This upward force 
is of course transferred to the coupled railcar, which has the effect of "transferring" 
weight from the railcar to the railcar moving vehicle. Thus, the wheels of the railcar 
moving vehicle are provided with more traction, which permits the vehicle to effectively 
move heavily loaded railcars. If the railcar is fully loaded, the operator of the moving vehicle can hook up to 
the car and typically position the coupler lift mechanism to the full-on position, thus 
transferring weight of typically up to 48,000 pounds onto the railcar moving vehicle. 
However, if the railcar is partially full or empty, then the operator must make a 
judgment of how much weight he can transfer to his vehicle. If his judgment is 
conservative, then he does not transfer the maximum possible amount of weight, which 
reduces the maximum tractive effort available for the vehicle. However, if the operator  
 
overestimates the amount of weight transfer, a more serious result can take place, in that 
the railcar can be lifted off of one of its railcar truck wheels. The railcar can be 
actually separated from one of its truck wheels so that, when the railcar moving vehicle 
moves the railcar, the truck wheel does not move with it. Potentially serious damage 
can take place in this instance. In accordance with this invention, a simple apparatus and technique is provided 
for determining the point at which a maximum amount of load has been transferred 
from the railcar to the car moving vehicle, but the railcar has not yet been lifted off of 
its truck, so that the railcar can be effectively moved by the moving vehicle of this 
invention, even with an operator who is relatively unskilled. This substantially 
eliminates the accidental separation of the railcar from one of its truck wheels. In this invention, a railcar moving vehicle has a frame, and is generally in 
accordance with prior art railcar vehicles except for the

In a railcar moving vehicle having a frame, a coupler for coupling said 
vehicle to a coupler of a railcar, and hydraulic means having a hydraulic power line for 

raising said vehicle coupler to transfer weight from the railcar to the vehicle, the 
improvement comprising, in combination: 

   means for sensing fluid pressure in said hydraulic power line; comparator means 
for monitoring an increase in said fluid pressure as the hydraulic means raises said 

vehicle coupler while coupled to a railcar, and for sensing a substantial termination of 
said increase in fluid pressure as said hydraulic means further raises said vehicle coupler 

while coupled to said railcar; and indicator means for signalling the occurrence of said 
substantial termination of the fluid pressure increase. 
The vehicle of Claim 1 in which said signalling of the occurrence is 
indicated by automatically terminating the raising of said vehicle coupler by the 

hydraulic means. 
The method of transferring weight from a first vehicle to a second vehicle 
through joined couplings of said vehicles, which method comprises: 

   raising the coupling of said second vehicle to cause raising of the joined 
coupling of the first vehicle; monitoring an increase in the force required to raise the 

vehicle couplings as said raising continues; sensing a substantial termination of the 
increase in said force as further raising of said vehicle couplings takes place; and 

signalling the occurrence of said substantial termination. 
The method of Claim 3 in which said vehicle coupling is raised by hydraulic 
means, and said force increase is monitored and said substantial termination is sensed 

through sensing of hydraulic fluid pressure. 
The method of Claim 4 in which said substantial termination is signalled by 
automatic termination of said raising. 
The method of Claim 3 in which said substantial termination is signalled by 
automatic termination of said raising.
