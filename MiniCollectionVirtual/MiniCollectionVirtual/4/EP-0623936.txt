<CLAIMS>
A thermally stable electrical insulating paper 
comprising 


A. 15-95% by weight of synthetic resin fibers, 
B. 5-85% by weight of polymer fibrids, 
C. 0-30% by weight of a synthetic resin powder, and 
D. 0-80% by weight of mineral fillers, 
 
wherein the synthetic resin fibers A are made of a 

melamine-formaldehyde condensation product. 
An electrical insulating paper as claimed in 
claim 1 wherein the melamine resin fibers A have a 

specific surface area (BET) of less than 1 [m
2
·g
-1
] and 

the polymer fibrids B have a specific surface area (BET) 
of greater than 3 [m
2
·g
-1
]. 
An electrical insulating paper as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2 wherein the melamine resin fibers A are made 

of a melamine resin in which from 1 to 30 mol% of the 
melamine is replaced by a hydroxyalkylmelamine. 
An electrical insulating paper as claimed in any 
of claims 1 to 3 wherein the polymer fibrids are made of 

a thermally stable thermoplastic, a thermoset or cellulose. 
An electrical insulating paper as claimed in any 
of claims 1 to 4 wherein the synthetic resin powder C is 

made of a curable synthetic resin or of a thermally 
stable thermoplastic. 
An electrical insulating paper as claimed in any 
of claims 1 to 5 wherein the filler D comprises a powder 

having an average particle size from 0.1 to 40 µm or 
platelets having an average thickness from 1 to 100 µm. 
A process for producing the electrical insulating  
 

paper of claim 1 which comprises processing an aqueous 
dispersion containing the components A and B and if 

appropriate C and D and having a solids content from 0.1 
to 10% by weight on a paper machine to form a paper, 

drying the paper at from 120 to 180°C, and finally 
densifying and smoothing it at above 200°C by pressing. 
The use of melamine-formaldehyde condensation 
products for producing a thermally stable electrical 

insulating paper as claimed in claim 7.
