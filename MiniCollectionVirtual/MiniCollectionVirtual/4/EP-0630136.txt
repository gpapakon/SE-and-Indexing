<ABSTRACT>
A first phase change is introduced to an analog signal based on a symbol 
specified by a data signal, where the symbol is one of a plurality of symbols in a 

symbol constellation. The analog signal 416 is added to the data signal 408 to form a 
combined signal 417 which is transmitted over a communication channel that 

introduces a channel phase change to the analog and data signals. After transmission 
through the communication channel, the combined signal comprises a phase changed 

analog signal and a phase changed data signal. A received symbol is specified by the 
phase changed data signal, and a phase shift is introduced to the phase changed 

analog signal based on the identity of the received symbol.

<DESCRIPTION>
Related subject matter is disclosed in the application filed concurrently 
herewith and assigned to the same assignee hereof entitled "Simultaneous Analog 
and Digital Communication", inventors Gordon Bremer and Kenneth D. Ko. This invention relates to simultaneous transmission of analog and digital 
signals and, more particularly, to simultaneous transmission of analog signals and 
digital signals in a non-multiplexed manner and in a co-extensive frequency band. In the prior art, when voice and data is transmitted simultaneously over 
a channel, it is typically transmitted either via frequency-division multiplexing or 
time-division multiplexing. In frequency-division multiplexing, the data channel 
and the voice channel are allocated different sub-bands of the channel's bandwidth. 
Examples of that are U.S. Patent No. 4,757,495, U. S. Patent 4,672,602, and U. S. 
Patent 4,546,212. In time-division multiplexing arrangements, voice signals are 
sampled, digitized and interleaved with digital data to form a single information 
stream which is communicated over the available channel. Practically every digital 
carrier system (e.g. the T1 carrier system) is an example of that. U.S. Patent No. 4,512,013, issued April 16, 1985, presents an interesting 
approach that is close to a frequency division multiplexing arrangement for 
simultaneous voice and data. The arrangement filters the speech signal and adds 
thereto a modulated narrowband signal to form the transmitted signal. The 
narrowband modulated signal derives from a narrowband digital input signal that is 
modulated with a carrier, thereby shifting the narrow-band up in frequency to a 
position in the spectrum where there is little speech energy. At the receiver, in 
reliance of the fact that the speech power is low in the narrowband occupied by the 
modulated digital signal, the digital signal is recovered through appropriate 
demodulation. Thereafter, the recovered digital signal is remodulated to replicate the 
transmitter's operation, adaptively filtered to account for channel characteristics, and 
subtracted from the received signal. The result is the received speech. As indicated 
above, one salient characteristic of that arrangement, as stated in col. 2, lines 13-18, 
is that "...an entire analog speech signal and a modulated data signal are capable of 
being transmitted over a normal analog channel by the multiplexing of the data 
signal within the portion of the normal analog speech signal frequency band where  
 
the speech signal is present
