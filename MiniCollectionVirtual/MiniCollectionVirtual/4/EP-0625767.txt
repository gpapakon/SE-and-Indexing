<ABSTRACT>
In an automatic toll collection system with payment stations on roads and correspondingly equipped vehicles which have a vehicle-mounted device and a communication device for wireless exchange of data with a vehicle transceiver and an electronic user card in the form of a processor card, the payment stations simply take the form of credit-cancelling stations (EWS) which each deduct a specific fee and record the deductions of the last credit-cancelling stations (EWS) with the necessary data for safeguarding to establish proof of payment on the processor card. For this purpose, independent, separate, stationary and/or mobile control devices (KON) are provided which interrogate the individual vehicles (FZ) in the flow of traffic and detect and register non-paying vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Verification system for checking the payment of
tolls by road users in an automatic toll collection

system with payment stations on roads and appropriately
equipped vehicles which have a vehicle-mounted device

and a communications unit for wireless exchange of data
with a vehicle transceiver, and an electronic use

ticket in the form of a processor card, characterized
in that the payment stations are designed merely as

value-deduction stations (EWS) which each debit a
specific use toll and log the debit entries carried out

by the last value-deduction stations (EWS) with the
necessary data to provide a record on the processor

card, and in that separate fixed and/or mobile
verification devices (KON) are provided independently

of the value-deduction stations (EWS), said
verification devices (KON) interrogating in a wireless

fashion the logged debit entries and data of the
processor cards of the individual vehicles (FZ) by

means of the vehicle transceiver as the traffic flows
and in doing so determine vehicles (FZ) with non-satisfactory

payment of tolls as non-payers and
register these vehicles (FZ).
Verification system according to Claim 1,
characterized in that when infrared light transmission

devices, which are known per se, are used, the value-deduction
station (EWS) is formed by one or more

infrared beacons (IRB) with an associated verification 
device (STV), and in that the verification or

interrogation device (KON) is formed by an infrared
transceiver (infrared head) which is aligned with the

vehicle (FZ) which is to be verified and has an
associated control and display device (ANZ).
Verification system according to Claim 2,
characterized in that an infrared light-sensitive video

camera (IRV) is additionally provided for the

verification operation.
Verification system according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the verification or interrogation

device (KON) is designed as a hand-held device (HG).
Verification system according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the verification device

(KON) is arranged in a verification vehicle (KFZ) in
such a way that a vehicle (FZ) which travels behind the

verification vehicle (KFZ) can be verified at a high
speed and with a large distance between vehicles.
Verification device according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that permanently

set-up verification devices (KON) only have devices for
the vehicle detection (IS) of non-payers.
Verification device according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that permanently set-up

verification devices (KON) additionally have automatic
vehicle identification devices (IRV, RD, NV).
Verification devices according to Claim 1,
characterized in that microwave transmission devices

are provided for the exchange of data between the
vehicles and the value-deduction stations or the

verification device.
Verification devices according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the value-deduction

stations and the verification devices are
used in an open toll collection system.
