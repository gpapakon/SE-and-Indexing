<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for feeding particulate material into a pressurized container. Particulate material is supplied to a container (1, 101) arranged at a lower pressure and is transferred to the pressurized container (2, 102), from where the particulate material is transported through a preferably vertical pipe (3, 103) with a large length/diameter ratio. This pipe is adapted to interconnect the containers (1, 2, 101, 102) and has a length/diameter ratio adapted such that a material column (4, 104) of particulate material is built up in the pipe, that a limited leakage flow, which is not capable of fluidizing the particulate material in the container (1, 101) arranged at a lower pressure, flows through the material column (4, 104), and that the transport of particulate material while being influenced by gravity is directed downwards into the pressurized container (2, 102).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and equipment for feeding
particulate material into a pressurized container.
Preferably, the particulate material is fed from a container
which is arranged at a lower pressure, for example from a
container at atmospheric pressure, into a pressurized
container. The invention primarily relates to the feeding of
particulate fuel and/or particulate bed material to a
combustor arranged in the form of a fluidized bed.The feeding and handling of particulate material, in the
form of bed material and fuel, which is supplied to a
combuscor, in the form of a pressurized fluidized bed,
present difficult problems and are achieved with present-day
technique by mixing the particulate material with water and
pumping in the material in the form of a paste, or by
pneumatic transport of particulate material. In the latter
case, according to known technique, a feeding system in the
form of a locking system is used, which comprises valves and
intermediate containers, a so-called lock-hopper system.In a PFBC (Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion) power plant
the fluidized bed may operate at a pressure of the order of
magnitude of 20 bar, and therefore a feeding system
comprising valves is exposed to great stresses resulting in
a rapid deterioration of the sealing capacity of the valves.
The service life becomes short and the maintenance costs
become high. The US-A-4 530 290 describes an atmospheric fluidized bed
combustor which is supplied with particulate fuel via a feed
apparatus which is connected to a storage silo without the
use of a lock-hopper system. The feed apparatus itself
houses a fluidized bed, and the material is transported to
the combustor via a plurality of transport pipes which penetrate
the fluidize bed in the feed apparatus from below and
extend above the surface of the fluidize bed. Pressurized
gas is injected below the fluidize bed and enters into the
openings of the transport pipes thereby carrying particulate
material from the fluidized bed into the transport pipes.
The amount of this material depends on the extension of the
transport pipes above the surface of the fluidize bed. A
feed means in the form of a supply pipe is inserted from
above into the fluidize bed and is connected at its upper
end to a horizontally arranged conventional feeder which
feeds particulate material from one of its ends where the
feeder is connected to a cone-shaped storage silo to the
other end and into the said supply pipe. The material in the
supply pipe is supposed to act as a seal for

A method of feeding particulate material into a container
(2,102) which is pressurized by connecting it to a pressurized

fluidized bed combustor, with the particulate material
being supplied to a container (1,101) which is arranged at a

lower pressure, preferably at atmospheric pressure, from
where the particulate material is transferred to the pressurized

container (2,102) via a 
substantially
 vertical pipe
(3,103), which interconnects the two containers, and with a

material column (4,104) of particulate material being built
up in said pipe (3,103), 
characterized
 in that

the pressure drop across the material column maintains the
pressure difference between the containers and the leakage

as which escapes from the pressurised container (2,102) is
prevented from fluidizing the material in the low-pressure

container (1,101) by appropriate selection of the length-to-diameter
ratio of said pipe and the convergence of the downwardly

decreasing cross-sectional area of the lower art of
the low-pressure container (2,101) which changes into and

continues as said pipe (3,103) thus
 allowing the material to

be transported by gravity down through the pipe and into the
pressurized container 
(2,102).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that said low-pressure container at its lower part is arranged
with a downwardly decreasing cross-section area in

the form of cone-shaped sections with intermediate cylindrical

A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that the grain size distribution of the particulate
material is adapted to control the leakage flow of gas

through the material column (4,104). 
A device for feeding particulate material into a container
(2,102) which is adapted to be pressurized by its

connection to a pressurized fluidized bed combustor, with
the particulate material being adapted to be supplied to a

container (1,101) which is arranged at a lower pressure,
preferably at atmospheric pressure, from where the particulate

material column maintains the pressure difference between

the containers .
