<ABSTRACT>
A current collecting apparatus provided with 
sliders 2 for collecting electric power from a power 

feeder 1, a current collector 3 for holding the power, 
an insulator for insulating and supporting the current 

collector 3, and a flexible conductor for delivering 
the power held in the current collector 3 to a 

conductor 5, which is connected to the flexible 
conductor and used for supplying the power to the 

vehicle side. The conductor 5 and the insulator 4 are 
disposed so that the former is offset with respect to 

the latter in the crosswise direction of a railway 
vehicle. With this arrangement, aerodynamic noise 

emanating from the current collector loaded on the 
vehicle running at high speed can be substantially 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to current collecting
apparatus for railway vehicles and more particularly to a
current collecting apparatus fit for use in a vehicle on a
high-speed railway.Railway vehicles using electric power as a power source are
generally equipped with current collecting apparatus on their
roofs for collecting electric power by contact with overhead
power lines.Such a current collecting apparatus arranged as a vertically
movable assembly is known from FR-A-2 664 214. Another
current collecting apparatus for a railway vehicle is known
from FR-A-2 657 052. This current collecting apparatus comprises
a current collector for collecting electric power from
a power feeder, which current collector has a shape of an
inverted U. The current collector is supported on the vehicle
by two insulators. Furthermore the current collecting apparatus
according to FR-A-2 657 052 comprises two conductors for
conducting the power received from the current collector,
whereby one conductor is arranged immediately adjacent to one
insulator and the other conductor is arranged immediately
adjacent to the other insulator on the vehicle. Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 304101/1992 discloses a noise reducing
arrangement attainable by installing sound arresters
(covers) in front and behind a current collecting
apparatus as means for suppressing noise. This noise
reducing arrangement is such that sound arresters are
respectively installed in front and behind a current
collecting apparatus to place the current collecting
apparatus in the airflow decelerated thereby so as to
prevent not only aerodynamic noise from being produced
from the current collecting apparatus but also the
aerodynamic noise from radiating therefrom.The prior art current collecting apparatus
disclosed in the aforementioned Japanese patent publication is
obviously intended to reduce the noise generated from
the current collecting apparatus during relatively
high-speed traveling. However, in the case of a high-speed
railway in the next generation on which the
operation is aimed at a speed of as high as 350 km/hr,
there still arises a problem of aerodynamic noise
originating from such noise arresters themselves and
the measure taken to reduce noise by means of the
current collecting apparatus can hardly be effective
in high-velocity zones. Since the air resistance
generated while vehicles are traveling increases in
proportion to the square of the velocity, moreover, an 
increase in operating cost due to travel resistance originating
from the
