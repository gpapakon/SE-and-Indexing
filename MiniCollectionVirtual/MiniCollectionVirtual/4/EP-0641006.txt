<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cathode for an electron tube for use in 
such display devices as a picture tube, and more particularly, to a novel cathode for 
an electron tube having high current density and a long lifetime. For the conventional thermoelectron emitting cathode for an electron tube 
which is used in a picture tubes and other display devices, a so-called "oxide 
cathode" which includes alkaline earth metal oxide layer having Ba as a main 
component on a metal base containing Ni as a main component and a small amount 
of Si, Mg, etc. as a reducing agent is widely used. This oxide cathode emits 
electrons provided by free atoms produced from oxides through the reaction 
between reducing agents in the metal base and oxides. FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of the conventional oxide 
cathode. The cathode comprises a circular pellet-type metal base 1, circular tube-type 
sleeve 2 and electron emissive material layer 4 which is coated and formed on 
the metal base 1 and contains a barium compound as a main component. The 
reference numeral 3 designates a heater for heating the cathode. Among the constituting components, the electron emissive material layer is 
formed by the following method. That is, carbonate powder which contains barium 
carbonate as a main component is mixed with solvents in which nitrocellulose or so 
is dissolved. The mixture is then coated on the base metal by spray or 
electrodeposition, etc. The cathode having each components is later installed in a 
cathode ray tube and then assembled in an electron tube. During an exhaust process  
 
to make the inside of the electron tube vacuous, the cathode is heated to about 
1000°C. At this time, barium carbonate in the electron emissive material layer 
thermally decomposes and changes into barium oxide as the following chemical 
formula.

BaCO₃ → BaO + CO₂↑   (1)


 
   The produced barium oxide reacts with the reducing agents in the metal 
base, Si and Mg at the interface of the metal base and the electron emissive material 
layer during the cathode operation as the following chemical formula.

BaO + Mg → MgO + Ba↑   (2)4BaO + Si → Ba₂SiO₄ + 2Ba↑   (3)


 
   The thus-produced free Ba contributes to an electron emission. However, at 
this time, MgO and Ba₂SiO₄ also are produced as described in formulae (2) and (3) 
at the interface between electron emissive material layer and the metal base. This 
reaction product accumulates around the interface and becomes a barrier, called an 
"interlayer" which
