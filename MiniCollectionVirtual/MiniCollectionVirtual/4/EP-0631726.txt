<ABSTRACT>
A method for sanitizing food products that utilizes 
ozone containing bubbles. The food product is immersed in a 

liquid bath that has a plurality of ozone containing bubbles 
streaming therethrough. Enough ozone containing bubbles are 

provided such that a continuous stream of bubbles are always 
present within the liquid bath. The ozone containing bubbles 

are typically an ozone air mixture and can be introduced into 
the liquid bath directly as a bubble gas stream or can be 

mixed with the liquid of the liquid bath prior to their 
introduction into the bath itself. When the food product is 

immersed in the bath containing the ozone containing bubbles, 

the ozone in the bubbles contacts the surfaces of the food 
product and has a sanitizing effect thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to a method for
sanitizing food products and more particularly to a method
wherein ozone containing bubbles are used to sanitize food
products which are capable of being immersed in a liquid
bath.It has become increasingly important in the food
industry that products provided to the public be quite
sanitary. A health conscious and knowledgeable public
demands that the food products which are made available be
of highest quality. Such products must be safe and free
from the effects of disease causing bacteria or harmful
chemicals. Tight sanitary standards are not only demanded
by the public, but are also required by governmental health
and safety regulations. Thus, food processors are ever
seeking safe, economical, and efficient methods which help
them meet rigid public imposed standards and government
regulations.Bacteria of some kind or another can be found on
virtually every object in our environment. Bacteria are
present on most living organisms, such as poultry, cattle
and swine and are also found on other food products such as
fruits and vegetables. While many bacteria are beneficial
to both man and the environment, others are harmful,
especially those that are capable of causing sickness or
disease in man.Some of the more pathogenic bacteria are those
classified as Enterobacteriaceae and include such organisms
as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Enterobacterspp.
These types of bacteria are normally found within the
intestinal flora of mammals and are considered responsible
for such intestinal infections as bacterial dysentery and
bacterial food poisoning. While efforts are made to
control the existence of these types of bacterial in foods
and in food processing facilities, large scale food
preparation operations often provide favourable
environments for the growth of these organisms. A number of steps have been taken in the food industry
in an effort to solve the bacterial problem. Attempts have
been made to sanitize food products by processes involving
heat, ultraviolet irradiation or chemicals. While each of
these methods show some efficacy under certain conditions,
there are many situations where these methods are
inapplicable, inefficient or perhaps undesirable for
particular food products.A primary disadvantage of utilizing any of the
aforementioned sanitizing methods is that such methods
often lead to a change in the appearance or taste of the
food product that makes the product undesirable to the
consumer. Furthermore, some chemical methods are
undesirab

<CLAIMS>
A method for sanitizing whole poultry carcasses
comprising the steps of: introducing a gas which is a

mixture of air and ozone into a liquid bath in a manner
creating a continuous flow of a plurality of ozone

containing bubbles having diameters in the range 2mm to
10mm in said liquid bath; placing a poultry carcass into

said liquid bath in a manner allowing said ozone containing
bubbles to contact and wipe the surface of the poultry;

and removing the poultry carcass from said liquid bath.
The method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the
concentration of ozone in said mixture is between 0.025%

and 20% by weight.
The method as set forth in claim 2 in which the
concentration of ozone is between 0.025% and 4% by weight.
The method as set forth in any preceding claim wherein
said ozone containing bubbles are created in said liquid

bath by forcing said ozone containing gas directly into
said liquid bath.
The method as set forth in any of claims 1 to 3
wherein said ozone containing gas is mixed with a quantity

of the liquid of said liquid bath prior to said
introduction into said liquid bath.
The method as set forth in any preceding claim wherein
the quantity of said ozone containing bubbles in said

liquid bath is sufficient to permit all surfaces of the
food products being sanitized to interface with said

bubbles.
