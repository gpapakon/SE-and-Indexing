<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing mixtures of synthetic crystalline Kenyaite and oxygen-liberating salts, which is characterised in that 1 mol of sodium water glass having a molar ratio of SiO2:Na2O = 1:(0.25 to 0.5) is mixed with from 0.1 to 0.9 mol of a compound having a pH of less than 10.5 in molar aqueous concentration as neutralising agent and the mixture is heated for from 1 to 10 hours in the presence of Kenyaite seed crystals at temperatures of from 373 to 523 K, in particular from 453 to 493 K, in an autoclave and, after cooling, from 0.15 to 1.5 mol of hydrogen peroxide per 1 mol of sodium water glass used is added and the solid is isolated as dry substance from the reaction suspension.

A process for the preparation of a mixture of
synthetic, crystalline kenyaite and salts which split off

oxygen, which comprises mixing 1 mol of soda-water glass
which has a molar ratio of SiO
2
 : Na
2
O = 1 : (0.25 to
0.5) with 0.1 to 0.9 mol of a compound which has a pH of

less than 10.5 in molar aqueous concentration, as a
neutralizing agent, heating the mixture at temperatures

of 373 to 523 K, in particular of 453 to 493 K, in an
autoclave for 1 to 10 hours in the presence of kenyaite

seed crystals, and, after cooling, adding 0.15 to 1.5 mol
of hydrogen peroxide per mole of soda-water glass

employed and isolating the solid from the reaction
suspension as dry substance.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein, in
particular, peroxide salt-forming compounds such as

phosphoric acid, boric acid, silicic acid, carbon
dioxide, alkali metal hydrogencarbonate, alkali metal

dihydrogen phosphate or sodium tetraborate are used as
the neutralizing agent.
The process as claimed in either of claims 1 or
2, wherein the amount of neutralizing agent is metered in

such that a ratio of SiO
2
 : Na
2
O = (4 to 20) : 1 is 
present in the reaction suspension.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
3, wherein the hydrogen peroxide is added in the form of

a 5 to 75 % by weight aqueous solution.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
4, wherein 0.5 to 10 % by weight of seed crystals, based

on the SiO
2
 weight content in the soda-water glass, is
added.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
5, wherein the reaction is carried out in an autoclave at

a molar ratio of SiO
2
 : H
2
O = 1 : (5 to 100).
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
6, wherein the reaction is carried out in the presence of

aluminum, phosphorus, boron and/or heavy metal compounds,
such as, for example, iron.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
7, wherein the reaction mixture is brought to a pH of 9

to 12 before heating.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
8, wherein the reaction is carried out continuously.
The process as claimed in claim 9, wherein, in
the continuous procedure, 5 to 30 % by weight of seed

crystals, based on the SiO
2
 weight content in the soda-water
glass, are added.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to

10, wherein peroxidestabilizing compounds such
as, for example, magnesium silicate,

ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or tripolyphosphoric,
pyrophosphoric or orthophosphoric acid, in each case in

the form of their sodium salts, are added to the reaction
suspension. 
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
11, wherein the solid and the substances dissolved in the

reaction suspension are isolated as dry substance by
vacuum evaporation.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
11, wherein the reaction suspension is isolated as dry

substance with a heated stream of gas at a solids temperature
of between 303 and 363 K, for example in a

fluidized bed drier, drum drier, spray drier or
granulator.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
11, wherein the reaction suspension is separated into a

filtercake and filtrate, which are dried separately, and
the resulting dry substances are mixed with one another.
The process as claimed in claim 14, wherein some
of the hydrogen peroxide is added to the filtrate, the

mixture is evaporated to dryness and the residue is
combined in comminuted form with the dried filtercake.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
13, wherein 1 mol of soda-water glass which has a molar

ratio of SiO
2
 : Na
2
O = 1 : (0.25 to 0.5) is mixed with
0.1 to 0.9 mol of a compound which has a pH of less

than 10.5 in molar aqueous concentration, as a neutralizing
agent, the mixture is heated at temperatures of 373

to 523 K, in particular 453 to 493 K, in an autoclave for
1 to 10 hours in the presence of kenyaite seed crystals

and, in a modification of patent claim 1, the dry substance
is isolated and 0.15 to 1.5 mol of hydrogen

peroxide per mole of soda-water glass employed are added
to this dry substance.
