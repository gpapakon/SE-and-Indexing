<ABSTRACT>
A transition module adapted to accept copy sheet input from an input feeder short 
edge first and feed the copy sheets long edge first to the main paper path of a processing 

apparatus. The transition module includes a belt-on-belt transport (65,67) to move copy sheets 
into the transition module from, for example, the output of a third party feeder. The sheets 

are fed to the belt-on-belt transport (65,67) and driven against a registration edge (63). The 
belts are continuously running and provide enough drive force to move the sheets to the 

registration edge (63), but not enough to overdrive the sheets or cause buckling. Once each 
sheet is registered, double 'D' rolls (70-73) are activated for one revolution to pull the sheet 

from the belts (65,67) and feed it to an exit nip located downstream from the 'D' rolls (70-73).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet transport apparatus, and more particularly, to a 
compact transition module for transporting sheets in one direction and including simple means 
for changing the direction of movement of the sheets to feed them in another direction. Prior sheet transport mechanisms, for example in copying and printing machines, for 
moving a sheet in a first direction and then moving it in a second direction without rotation of 
the sheet, conventionally utilize two separate transport mechanisms orthogonal to each other, 
such as, two separate sets of feed belts or frictionally driven rotating balls. For example, a sheet 
is moved by the first set of belts or balls into the second set. However, this requires two 
separate sheet handling areas, and drive mechanisms and shifting of the sheet by some means 
from the one transport to the other. Examples of previously known bi-directional sheet 
transports, or driven ball sheet transports include US-A-s1,745,311; 1,889,513; 2,249,186 and 
3,630,518. These devices are expensive, cumbersome and not suited for high speed, high 
capacity applications. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cost effective input transitional 
module that enables a variety of high capacity feeding devices to connect to a laser printing 
system or the like. It is another object of the present invention to provide a transition module that 
accepts copy sheets inputted from a third party piece of equipment and feed the copy sheets to 
the main paper path of an imaging system. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a low cost, transition module 
that accepts copy sheets from a first piece of equipment short edge first and registers them and 
re-feeds them long edge first at high speed to another piece of equipment that places page 
image information onto the copy sheets and transports them to an output stacking apparatus. The present invention provides a sheet transition module for moving sheets received 
from the first device to the second device, comprising a sheet support surface; a sheet transport 
for transporting a sheet received from the first device to a predetermined position within the 
module; feed rolls, operable, in use, for one revolution once the sheet is stationary in said 
predetermined position in order to feed the sheet into the second device. To achieve the aforegoing and other objects, and to overcome shortcomings 
discussed above, a copy sheet input transition module is provided which is positioned between

<CLAIMS>
A sheet transition module for moving sheets received from the first device to the 
second device, comprising: 

   a sheet support surface (68); 
   a sheet transport (65,67) for transporting a sheet received from the first device to a 

predetermined position within the module; 
   feed rolls (70-73), operable, in use, for one revolution once the sheet is stationary in 

said predetermined position in order to feed the sheet into the second device. 
The transition module of claim 1, wherein, in use, a sheet is fed into said transition 
module in a first direction (9) and fed out of said transition module in a second direction (10) 

orthogonal to said first direction. 
The transition module of claim 1 or 2, wherein feed rolls (70-73) are 'D' shaped and 
preferably wherein each sheet transported by said sheet transport (65,67) passes between an 

opening between said 'D' rolls when said 'D' rolls are in a home position. 
The transition module of claim 1, 2 or 3, further including a registration edge (63) 
positioned at one edge of said sheet transport surface for registering sheets individually in said 

predetermined position. 
The transition module of any of the preceding claims, including at least one baffle 
(69;95,96) encountered by each sheet as it is driven by said sheet transport (65,67). 
The transition module of claim 5, wherein said at least one baffle (69;95,96) is ramp 
shaped with the maximum height of the ramp being terminated by an end portion positioned 

downstream of a direction of transport of the sheets by said sheet transport (65,67). 
The transition module of claim 6, wherein a sheet resting on said sheet support 

surface (68) has a trail edge thereof abutting against said end portion of said ramp. 
The transition module of any of the preceding claims, wherein, in use, one sheet is 
driven out of said transition module by said feed rolls (70-73) while another sheet is 

simultaneously driven into said transition module by said sheet transport (65,67). 
The transition module of any one of the preceding claims, wherein each sheet enters 
said transition module short edge first and exits said transition module long edge first. 
A copier/printer adapted to place page image information onto copy sheets fed to 
the copier/printer from a high speed feeder including a transition module according to any one 

of the preceding claims.
