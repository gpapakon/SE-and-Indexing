<ABSTRACT>
A door apparatus for a rest room includes a wall 
member defining a predetermined space and an opening for an 

entrance and an exit thereof; a door body for opening or 
shutting the opening, having a substantially half-cylindrical 

shape, being rotatable about a center of 
curvature of the half-cylindrical shape; and a driving 

device for driving and rotating the door body about the 
center of curvature. In a preferred embodiment, the 

driving device has a pulley with a peripheral shape of 
involute, a wire wound about the pulley, and a weight 

connected to an end of the wire. The weight is inserted 
into a tube receiving oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a door apparatus for a rest room which is
preferably used for a public comfort station, a rest room or a lavatory which is
located at a public park or a lobby in a hotel, and in particular to a door apparatus
which enable to improve used efficiency of the space in the rest room.Conventionally, a public comfort station is usually provided with a
box-shaped construction which defines a rest room. Normally, a rectangular
plate door is mounted on the construction at the opening thereof through a hinge
in a manner being able to open or shut.An alternative door arrangement is described in EP-A-0 305 340 which is
concerned with a security vestibule entry for controlled access to banks and the
like. In that arrangement two doors of arc-shape are provided to give controlled
access to the bank. The doors are operable to provide angular openings of 90° or
less.According to the present invention there is provided door apparatus for a rest
room comprising two spaced apart wall means facing each other and defining a
common entrance to and exit from the rest room, door means for opening and
closing the entrance and exit, said door means comprising a first half cylindrical
door member rotatable about a centre of curvature of its half cylindrical shape, a
second half cylindrical door member also rotatable about a centre of curvature of
its half cylindrical shape, the door members being separated from one another
and mounted to permit relative rotation to take place between them, the door
members being arranged one within the other during part of said relative rotation, 
each of said door members being rotatable from a first position lying wholly
between the spaced apart wall means, to a second position displaced 180° from
the first position.Fig. 1 shows the first step in using an embodiment of a door apparatus for
a rest room according to the present invention;Fig. 2 shows the second step using the door apparatus of Fig 1;Fig. 3 shows the third step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 4 shows the fourth step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 5 shows the fifth step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 6 shows the sixth step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 7 shows the seventh step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 8 shows the eighth step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 9 shows the ninth step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1;Fig. 10 shows the tenth step using the door apparatus of Fig. 1.Although a rest room of a large-sized construction is usually situated in

<CLAIMS>
A door apparatus for a rest room (81) comprising two spaced apart wall
means (82,83) facing each other and defining a common entrance to and exit from the

rest room, door means (84) for opening and closing the entrance and exit, said door
means co
mprising a first half cylindrical door member (85) rotatable about a centre of
curvature of its half cylindrical shape, a second half cylindrical door member (86)

also rotatable about a centre of curvature of its half cylindrical shape, the door
members being separated from one another and mounted to permit relative

rotation to take place between them, the door members being arranged one
within the other during part of said relative rotation, each of said door members

being rotatable from a first position lying wholly between the spaced apart wall
means, to a second position displaced 180° from the first position.
A door apparatus for a rest room according to claim 1 in which the outer
of said door members (86) has free edges which in at least said one rotational

position lie adjacent the respective spaced apart wall means (82,83).
A door apparatus for a rest room according to claim 1 or 2 in which the
two door members (85,86) can be rotated into positions one within the other

with the outer door member (86) arranged wholly between the spaced apart wall
means (82,83) to enable a user to move into a position between the spaced apart

wall means (82,83).
A door apparatus for a rest room according to claim 3 in which the inner
of the door members (85) can be rotated relative to the outer door member (86)

into a different position whereby the door members (85,86) can surround a user
as the user enters or leaves the rest room. 
A door apparatus for a rest room according to claim 4 in which in the said
different position of the inner door member (85), the door members (85,86) can

completely surround the user.
A door apparatus for a rest room according to claim 5 and with the inner
door member (85) remaining in its said different position, in which the outer

door member (86) can be rotated from the position wholly between the wall
means (82,83) to another position in which the inner and outer door members

(85,86) lie one within the other whereby the user instead of being completely
surrounded by the door members (85,86) can pass into the rest room through a

space created by such rotation of the outer door member (86).
