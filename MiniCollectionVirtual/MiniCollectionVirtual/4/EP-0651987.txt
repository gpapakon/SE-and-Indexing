<ABSTRACT>
A hydromassage bath comprises, disposed on the surface of 
the bath, a plurality of nozzles (11) which emit jets of 

water and a distributed plurality of transducer elements 
(13) which emit ultrasonic waves, thereby making it 

possible to achieve various combined operating modes of 
hydromassage with jets of water and ultrasounds, offering 

a high degree of well-being for the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an innovative bath having 
ultrasonic hydromassaging means. It is well-known that there are baths comprising a 
hydromassage system achieved by recirculating water sucked 
up from the inside of the bath, mixed with air and 
returned to the bath through nozzles to impinge upon 
immersed parts of the body of the user and create ample 
areas of turbulence around them. The general scope of this invention is to provide an 
innovative hydromassage bath which practically and 
effectively provides a micromassaging action produced by 
generation of ultrasonic waves. This scope is achieved, according to the invention, by 
providing a hydromassage bath comprising, in combination, 
disposed on the surface of the bath, a plurality of 
nozzles which emit jets of water and a distributed 
plurality of transducer elements which emit ultrasonic 
waves. The innovative principles of this invention and its 
advantages compared to the known technique will be more 
clearly evident from the following description of a 
possible exemplificative embodiment applying such 
principles, with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which: 
figure 1 shows a schematic longitudinal cross-sectional 
view of a hydromassage bath applying the innovative  
 
principles of the invention; figure 2 shows a schematic longitudinal cross-sectional 
view of an ultrasonic transducer usable in the bath of 
figure 1. With reference to the figures, figure 1 shows a schematic 
view of a bath, generically indicated by reference 10, 
advantageously comprising a known hydromassage system 
composed of apertures 11 for intake and emission of water, 
mixed with air, disposed between the intake and delivery 
of a pump 12. A system of this kind, together with its 
control circuits, is easily imaginable by the expert in 
the field and therefore will not be further described or 
shown herein. The bath further comprises the conventional 
accessories such as drain, overflow, etc. The bath can be 
advantageously made of plastic material, for example, 
composite material, with supporting structure made of 
metal tubes, as will be obvious to the expert in the 
field. Innovatively, facing on to the inner surface of the bath 
are ultrasonic transducers 13 which emit ultrasounds in 
the internal volume of the bath. The transducers, for 
example of the piezoelectric type, are disposed in such a 
way as to be submerged when the bath is filled and are 
advantageously distributed so as to generate a generically 
uniform ultrasonic intensity in the
