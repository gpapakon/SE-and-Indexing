<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sealing 
device, on tubular and/or circular tanks, for firing 

membrane valves, for cleaning sleeve filters, which 
comprises, inside a tubular and/or circular tank, 

a firing pipe, one end of which is connected to a 
membrane solenoid valve and the other end of which 

tightly projects from the tank. 
The device is characterized in that it comprises 
a fitting, connected to the firing pipe and 

including a recess for housing therein sealing 
means for providing a sealed coupling with the 

outer surface of the tank, as well as a sealing 
coupling surface for the solenoid valve. 
Moreover, a washer element is provided, which 
can be coupled to the other end of the firing pipe, 

and supports sealing means for providing a sealed 
connection between the firing pipe and the tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealing
device, on tubular and/or circular tanks, for firing
membrane valves, for cleaning sleeve filters.As is known, for cleaning sleeve filters
there are at present used membrane valves, coupled
to firing pipes, said valves being applied to a
tank containing pressurized air.With tubular and/or circular tanks, in order
to provide the sealing, there are at present welded
flanges on the surface of the tank, at the fitting
region of the firing pipe and at the connection
region of the solenoid valve, so as to provide an
abutment surface adapted for the desired sealed
connection.Such a machining is very expensive and requires
a very great skillness by the operator, who
must weld at critical regions.Accordingly, the aim of the present invention
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks,
by providing a sealing device, on tubular and/or
circular tanks, for firing membrane valves, for
cleaning sleeve filters, which allows the possibility 
of easily and quickly coupling the membrane
valve and firing pipe without performing any welding
operations.Within the scope of the above mentioned aim,
a main object of the present invention is to provide
such a sealing device which is specifically
designed for greatly simplifying all of the machining
operations, while providing very high sealing, reliability
and use safety characteristics, and which,
moreover, can be easily made starting from easily
commercially available elements and materials and
which, moreover, is very competitive from a mere
economic standpoint.The problem of avoiding the welding at the level of the
branching connection of pipes is already known in the field of
plumbing and hydraulics. Different solutions for sealing joints
used for branching gas or liquids are proposed by the prior
art.GB-A-13997, GB-A-951823 and US-A-3812910 teach a method for improving
the joining or connecting branch pipes by means of flanges
formed on the branch pipe and entered through corresponding
openings in main pipe.The sealing is thereby assured by the pressure exercised by the
flanges on the inner wall of the main pipe, improved by washer
elements and/or gaskets.A solution to engage the outer wall of the main pipe of a
branch connection is, instead, given in FR-A-340586.The above cited prior art does not,anyway, discloses how to
effect a connection between a tank
and a firing pipe inside said tank, by
means of a connected valve.
US-A-4, 376, 523 discloses a sealing device
according to the preamble of claim 1.According to one aspect of
