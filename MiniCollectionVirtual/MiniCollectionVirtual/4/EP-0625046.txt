<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in or relating to pharmaceutical compositions 
comprising a beclomethasone ester. In particular the invention relates to novel aerosol 
formulations of use in the administration of beclomethasone dipropionate by inhalation Beclomethasone dipropionate is 9α-chloro-16β-methyl-1,4-pregnadiene-11β,17α-21-triol-3,20-dione 
17α,21-dipropionate and may be represented by the formula (I). 
The corticosteroid of formula (I) is known to exhibit topical antiinflammatory activity 
and is described and claimed in GB 1047519. In the treatment of asthmatic conditions it 
has been found to be effective to administer the compound in the form of dry powders or 
aerosols containing small particles of the medicament, conventionally prepared by 
micronisation. However the particle size of conventional formulations containing 
anhydrous beclomethasone dipropionate is known to increase on storage, due to solvate 
formation, to the extent that the medicament particles become too large to penetrate the 
bronchial system. A number of potential solutions to this problem have been proposed. In dry powder 
compositions containing beclomethasone dipropionate it has been suggested that the 
problem may be overcome by using beclomethasone dipropionate in the form of its 
monohydrate (GB 2107715). In aerosol formulations the use of micronised solvates of 
beclomethasone dipropionate, for example chlorofluorocarbon solvates (GB 1429184),  
 
ethyl acetate solvate (DE-3018550), C5-8alkane solvates (EP-0039369), diisopropyl ether 
solvate (EP-0172672) and C1-5 alcohol solvates (WO86/03750) has been proposed. GB 
2076422 discloses a process for the preparation of chlorofluorocarbon aerosols which 
incorporates a low temperature (5 to -40°C) step which is also claimed to inhibit crystal 
growth. The presence of water in conventional aerosol formulations is known to be associated 
with a number of potential problems ad it is generally accepted that these preparations 
should be maintained substantially free of water. The rigourous exclusion of atmospheric 
moisture during both the manufacture and storage of such formulations increases the 
difficulties of preparing satisfactory aerosols containing the drug and raises the overall 
cost of the final product. We have now found that certain novel aerosol formulations containing 
beclomethasone dipropionate and water are surprisingly stable. According to one aspect of the invention we provide an aerosol formulation 
comprising :- 
(a) particulate
