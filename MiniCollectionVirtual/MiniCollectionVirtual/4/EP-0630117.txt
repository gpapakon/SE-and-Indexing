<ABSTRACT>
A communications system simultaneously transmits both a primary data 
signal and a secondary voice signal in such a way that the dynamic range of the 

secondary voice signal is increased even though deliberate errors are introduced into 
the transmitted data portion of the signal. In particular, the communications system 

includes an error correcting technique like channel encoding and the constellation 
signal space is divided into a number of regions, where at least one of the regions 

overlaps with another region. The primary signal is channel encoded to select a 
particular one of the number of regions, the region being represented by a reference 

signal point value. The voice signal is encoded to provide a signal point vector, 

which is added to the reference signal point in such a way that the resultant signal 
point is located in the overlapping region thereby deliberately introducing an error 

into the resulting transmitted signal point stream. Notwithstanding the deliberately 
introduced error, the channel encoding of the primary signal allows a receiver to 

recover the originally selected reference signal point value, which when subtracted 
from the received signal point value approximates the voice signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications equipment, e.g., 
modems. In particular, this invention relates to the transmission of both voice and 
data signals over the same communications facility at the same time. Generally speaking, a modem processes a data signal to provide a 
modulated signal for transmission over a communications channel, like the public 
switched telephone network (PSTN), to a far-end modem, or receiving modem. 
While any modulation scheme may be used to generate the modulated signal, 
typically the modulated signal is the result of quadrature amplitude modulation 
(QAM). This modulated signal represents a sequence of data symbols, where each 
data symbol is a selected signal point from a constellation signal space. In this 
approach, there is a predefined minimum spacing between data symbols. This 
minimum spacing, or separation, is directly related to the desired error margin of the 
data communications system. The desired error margin is the acceptable level of 
noise in the communications system. For example, when the modulated signal is 
received by the far-end modem, the value of each received signal point is typically 
different from the transmitted signal point values, each of which was associated with 
a data symbol. This change in the signal point value is the result of noise introduced 
by the communications channel. As a result, the receiving modem performs a 
"slicing" operation on each received signal point of the sequence. This slicing 
operation simply estimates the closest data symbol to the received signal point. This 
is also known as a "hard decision." As long as the noise from the communications 
channel is less than the acceptable error margin the receiving modem will always 
correctly estimate the transmitted data symbol. However, when the noise from the communications channel is greater 
than the error margin, the receiving modem begins to make incorrect "hard 
decisions" about individual ones of the transmitted sequence of data symbols. An 
incorrect hard decision, or "hard error," occurs if an amount of noise greater than the 
error margin is added to a transmitted data symbol so that the received signal point is 
now closer to a data symbol that is different from the transmitted data symbol - 
with the result that the receiving modem erroneously picks the wrong data symbol. 
As a result, error correcting techniques are typically used to further encode the 
information so that the receiving modem can recover to an extent from any hard 
errors
