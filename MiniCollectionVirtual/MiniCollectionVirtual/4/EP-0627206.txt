<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasound medical treatment system capable of 
determining the hot spot at high spatial resolution, and 

preventing the displacement of the hot spot from the focal 
point (7). In the system, the imaging device for obtaining 

image data of a treatment portion containing a treatment 
target (8) and an energy irradiation device (2) for applying an 

energy irradiation onto the treatment target (8) are controlled 
in such a manner that the imaging device is controlled to 

obtain hot spot detection image data after the energy 
irradiation device is controlled to apply an energy 

irradiation at a prescribed level, so that a hot spot 
indicating a change due to a temperature change caused by 

the energy irradiation at the prescribed level can be 
detected from the hot spot detection image data, The energy 

irradiation device is then controlled to apply a 
treatment energy irradiation at a treatment level higher 

than the prescribed level according to the detected hot 
spot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical ultrasound
treatment apparatus for treating target by irradiating
intense focused ultrasound from outside of a patient, and an
ultrasonic medical treatment apparatus utilizing imaging
device. An apparatus of this kind is known, e.g., from
EP 0 170 416.The conventional non-invasive temperature measurement
for the interior of the patient using the temperature
dependent magnetic resonance (MR) parameters used in
conjunction with the ultrasound medical treatment requires
the complete data concerning the positional relationship of
the organs and the temperature coefficients for the organs.
Moreover, when the precision with respect to the temperature
is to be improved, in order to improve the S/N ratio, the
spatial resolution must be sacrificed. Thus, it has been
inappropriate for the hyperthermia which requires high
spatial and temperature resolutions.Also, when the temperature change occurs in the
measurement target, the measured MR parameters are going to
be changed because of its own temperature dependency, so that
the change of the image due to the degeneration can be
obscured, and the accurate judgement of the treatment effect
cannot be made, such that the treatment is ended prematurely
or applied excessively, and the efficiency of the treatment
is lowered and the normal tissues can be affected.On the other hand, at the portion with significant
motion such as the respiratory motion or heart beat motion, 
there has been a danger for the focal point of the irradiated
energy to be displaced and to damage the normal tissues.
Moreover, in a case of treating the relatively large
treatment target such as a cancer by a very small focal point
in a manner of scanning, the scanning plan (treatment plan)
can be spoiled, and the overlooking of the energy irradiation
position may occur.Furthermore, as known from EP 0 170 416, when the
ultrasound imaging device is incorporated, the real time
continuous monitoring of the treatment becomes possible, but
the ultrasound imaging device can only provide 2D tomographic
image, so that anything off the tomographic plane cannot be
handled. Moreover, the ultrasound imaging device has low
resolution so that the high precision setting of the focal
point is difficult and it has been very difficult to trace
the narrow region accurately.Now, in the ultrasound medical treatment apparatus, it
is important to irradiate the intense ultrasound only to the
treatment target and not to affect the normal tissues.
However, when the tissues having
