<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a silicon nitride based sintered body 
composed only of uniform, fine crystal grains, which possesses 

improved strength and fracture toughness in the middle and 
low temperature ranges. A crystalline silicon nitride 

powder composed of crystal grains whose longer-axis 
diameter is not more than 200 nm or an amorphous silicon 

nitride powder is used as the material powder. The silicon 
nitride powder is sintered at a temperature of 1200°C to 

1400°C or sintered with a product of sintering temperature 
(°C) and sintering time (sec) below 600000 (°C·sec) at a 

temperature of 1400°C to 1900°C. Thus, a silicon nitride 
based sintered body in which the longer-axis diameter of 

silicon nitride and/or sialon crystals is not more than 200 
nm is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicon 
nitride based sintered body having excellent mechanical 
properties in middle and low temperature ranges from room 
temperature to 1100°C as structural ceramic materials to be 
used for automobile parts, wear-resistant tools, and the 
like. The invention also relates to methods for producing 
the same. Silicon nitride is a material well balanced in 
strength, fracture toughness, corrosion resistance, wear 
resistance, thermal shock resistance, oxidation resistance, 
and the like, so that it is used over a wide range of 
fields such as cutting tools and engine parts. In 
particular, it has recently been drawing an industrial 
attention as a structural material of automobile engines, 
gas turbines, and the like. However, to apply silicon 
nitride based sintered bodies to those fields which demand 
high reliability to materials such as in automobile 
engines, it is essential to further improve their fracture 
toughness so as to overcome their brittleness, and to  
 
improve their strength at the same time. For example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication No. SHO 61-91065 and Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication No. HEI 2-44066, there have been 
proposed silicon nitride single-phase materials that show 
improved mechanical characteristics such as strength by 
generating a combination of crystal phases, or a composite 
crystal phase, of equiaxial particulate α'-sialon (general 
formula: Mx(Si, Al)12(O, N)16, wherein M represents Mg, Ca, 
Li, and rare-earth elements) and columnar β'-sialon 
(including β type silicon nitrides). However, as apparent 
from their embodiments, the methods for producing a 
sintered body that show a strength characteristic of their 
resulting sintered bodies stably exceeding 100 kg/mm2 by 
flexural strength are in all cases by the hot press 
process, such that high strength characteristic has not yet 
been attained stably from the industrial point of view. Also, there have been proposed composite 
materials, such as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. HEI 4-202059, in which 1 to 500 nm fine 
particles are dispersed in silicon nitride and sialon 
having a longer-axis diameter of 0.05 to 3 µm and an aspect 
ratio of 3 to 20. The composite materials indeed show a 
strength of 167 kg/mm2 at a maximum in the embodiments, but 
may incur deterioration in strength because they may  
 
contain coarse silicon nitride. Further, the composite 
materials only have a Weibull coefficient of 9 or so. 
Thus, high
