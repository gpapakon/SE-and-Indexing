<ABSTRACT>
Each spreader-roller (1) or end-roller stub axle (2) or journal is equipped with a full rolling-contact bearing with solid rollers (10) with partial clearance, and the lubricant used is the molten metal bath itself, with or without additives, in which the rolling-contact bearing is completely immersed.

Hot galvanizing roll, working completely immersed 
in a bath of molten metal, characterized in that each 

journal or spindle axle (2) of the bottom roller or the 
spreading roller (1) is equipped with a full rolling 

bearing with solid rollers (10), mounted with clearance so 
that their outer surface is free in order that the bath of 

molten metal can circulate freely inside the rolling 
bearing in operation and itself serves as a lubricant. 
Galvanizing roll according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that each rolling bearing consists of a ring (3) 

constituting an inner, male, bearing mounted on the journal 
(2) of the roll (1), of a ring (4) constituting an outer, 

fixed female, bearing shrunk-on inside the roll support arm 
(5), of a cage (6) with solid rollers in which the rollers 

(10) are inserted free with clearance, of right-hand and 
left-hand back plates or flanges (7) bolted respectively on 

either side of the support arm (5), of a lateral stop (8) 
also bolted on the support arm (5), and of a stop screw (9) 

screwed on the vertical end of the journal (2). 
Galvanizing roll according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the ring (3) is movable and shrunk on the 

journal (2) of the roll (1). 
Galvanizing roll according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the solid rollers (10) 

are cylindrical and inserted free in open notches of the 
cage (6). 
Galvanizing roll according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that at the cold mounting 

of the rolling bearing the play is minimal between the 
rollers (10) and the bearings (3, 4) and between the cage 

(6) and the back plates or flanges (7). 
Galvanizing roll according to one or more of  
 

Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the back plates or 
flanges (7) are shaped in such a way that the bath of 

molten metal can circulate freely inside the rolling 
bearing in operation and that the pickling bath allows the 

rolling bearing to be cleaned after removal of the roll 
from the line without additional dismantling. 
Galvanizing roll according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the rings (3, 4), the 

cage (6) and its rollers (10), the back plates or flanges 
(7) and the stop screw (9) are made of a super-refractory 

alloy which is very resistant to abrasion. 
Galvanizing roll according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the lateral stop (8), 

the screws (11) of the said stop and the screws (12) of the 
back plates or flanges (7) are made of a stainless steel 

extremely resistant to hot corrosion.
