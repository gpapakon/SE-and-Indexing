<ABSTRACT>
An image intensifier apparatus of this invention 
comprises a photocathode (110) for converting a first optical 

image to corresponding photoelectrons, a microchannel 
plate (130) for multiplying the photoelectrons, impressed with 

a voltage at both ends thereof, and a fluorescent screen (120) 
for converting the photoelectrons multiplied in the 

microchannel plate to a second optical image, emitting 
the second optical image to an image pickup device. 

Resistance of the microchannel plate is greater than or 
equal to 2.8 X 10¹⁵ GΩ and less than or equal to 

2.8 X 10¹⁶ GΩ 
per channel. Therefore, in a case that a luminance of 

the second optical image is smaller than or equal to 
saturation sensitivity of the image pickup device, the 

luminance of the second optical image is proportional to 
an illuminance of the first optical image, and in a case 

that the luminance of the second optical image is larger 
than saturation sensitivity of the image pickup device, 

the luminance of the second optical image is suppressed 
against increment of the illuminance of the first optical 

image. Thus, the halo phenomenon effect having a 
relatively large luminance is decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an imaging apparatus 
such as an image pickup apparatus or an image 
intensifier. An image intensifier apparatus is an apparatus 
for intensifying an extremely weak optical image few 
ten thousands times to enable that the optical image 
can be visible, and which is used for a two-dimensional 
measurement of extremely weak light, such 
as a noctovision. It is assumed that this apparatus 
is used under the extremely weak light. Under 
stronger light, halo phenomenon becomes a subject of 
a discussion. Fig. 1 shows this phenomenon. The halo 
phenomenon is a phenomenon that a limited circular 
area 220 of light around a spotlight appears on a 
fluorescent screen as a result of the bright spotlight 
210 entering the photocathode of the image 
intensifier. The explanation of this phenomenon is 
described in the paper "MIL-I-49052D 3.6.9, 4.6.9, 
6.3.8". Fig. 2 shows a luminous distribution in this 
case. In Fig. 2, the halo of 1.00 mm⊘ appears around 
the spotlight of approximately 0.15 mm⊘. In a case 
that the halo is weak, all are relatively weak, so 
that no problems are arose; however, in a case that 
the halo is strong, some places, where no light  
 
incides, conspicuously brighten, so that picture 
quality is substantially lowered. This is a unique 
characteristic of the image intensifier, which has 
been requested to be improved. As a countermeasure for the halo phenomenon, an 
electric method by the applicant of this invention is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 29781/1991 
published as JP-A-6329781 and other electric methods 
have been introduced. The method described in this 
publication is to control voltages impressed to a 
microchannel plate or others by detecting current of 
electrons toward the fluorescent screen so that this 
current does not exceed a certain value, and to 
suppress generation of surplus electrons by this 
control. Therefore, the halo phenomenon effect can be 
suppressed. The halo phenomenon is explicated by the 
applicant of this invention, and the explanation is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 
33840/1990. Fig. 3 shows a mechanism of the halo, and 
the mechanism will be explained below. Photoelectron 
of the spotlight photoelectrically converted in a 
photocathode is accelerated and multiplied in a 
microchannel plate (MCP) 130. The multiplied 
electrons are accelerated in the acceleration electric 
field and strike a fluorescent screen 116, and then 
emit fluorescence. At this time, the  
 
electrons scatter on an aluminum
