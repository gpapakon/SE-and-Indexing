<ABSTRACT>
A cable management system provides routing of 
wired services between service lines (16) and user lines 

(18). Each service line enters the cable system at a 
service termination unit circuit card (22) which also 

holds a portion of a crosspoint switch matrix (126). 
Each user line enters the system at a line termination 

unit circuit card (20). The service termination unit 
circuit cards are all mounted to connectors (36) on a 

first side of a centerplane board (24) and the line 
termination unit circuit cards are mounted to connectors 

(36) on the other side of the centerplane board. Pins 
(37) extending through the centerplane board (24) 

interconnect the connectors so that any service line can 
be connected to any user line. A system controller card 

(26) mounted to the centerplane board communicates with 
the circuit cards via a bus on the centerplane 

board (24). Each of the service and line termination unit 
circuit cards (20) is provided with a unique identification 

code corresponding to the connector (36) in which it is 
installed, in addition to "as built" information 

characterizing the card (20). The controller card (26) polls all 
the service and line termination unit circuit cards (20) to 

generate a "map" of all the "assets" of the system. 
Further, each line termination unit circuit card (20) 

provides a predetermined voltaae to all of the service 
termination unit circuit cards (20). The service termination 

unit circuit cards respond to the absence of that 
predetermined voltage from a connector (36) on the second 

side of the centerplane board (24) by opening all connections 
to that connector (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cable management system 
which provides routing of telephony, low and high speed 
data, power and video, between service lines and user 
lines under computer control and, more particularly, to 
such a system wherein automatic mapping of circuit cards 
incorporated in the system is effected. When wiring a commercial building, it is 
conventional that all of the services carried by wire, 
such as telephony, low and high speed data, power and 
video, enter the building for termination at respective 
patch panels. The patch panels are typically located 
within wiring closets and include a first array of 
terminations for the service lines which enter the 
building and a second array of terminations for the user 
lines which extend within the building to various user 
stations. Within each patch panel, the connections 
between the service lines and the user lines are made 
manually via jumper wires extending between the first 
array of terminations and the second array of 
terminations. In an ideal situation, records would be 
maintained as to where each wire goes within the 
building and to what it is connected. However, since 
the real world is not ideal, such records are not always 
properly maintained. In addition, wires are often 
tagged at the patch panels and the tags are lost or 
become outdated because of lack of updating. Therefore, 
when a technician is given a service order to add, move 
or change a connection, the technician must first 
determine exactly which physical wires are involved. 
This has proven to be a very time consuming and labor 
intensive chore. It has been proposed to provide a 
cable management system with automatic record keeping 
capability.  The proposed cable management system is interposed 
between a plurality of service lines and a plurality of 
user lines and includes a plurality of line termination 
units mounted on circuit cards which provide connections 
to the user lines and a plurality of service termination 
units which are mounted on circuit cards and provide 
connections to the service lines. Controllable 
switching means are coupled between the terminations to 
the user lines and the service lines for selectively 
providing physical electrical connections between 
selected ones of the service lines and selected ones of 
the user lines. A controller is provided to control the 
switching means to selectively make and open connections 
between the service lines and the user lines in 
accordance with received commands, the controller
