<ABSTRACT>
The crankcase (10), fixed (40) and orbiting (24) scrolls and Oldham 
coupling (16) are assembled to make a pump cartridge assembly (100) 

as a subassembly of a scroll compressor. The pump 
cartridge assembly is tested to determine whether or not 

it operates satisfactorily. Upon successful testing, the 
pump cartridge assembly is installed in the shell of a 

hermetic compressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
In assembling hermetic compressors in general and, 
specifically, hermetic scroll compressors, assembly is 
keyed to and takes place within the shell. Commonly 
assigned U.S. Patent 5,042,150 discloses an assembly 
method where the stator of the motor is secured in place 
in the shell and then serves as a reference for locating 
and securing the upper and lower bearings. With the 
bearings secured in place, the other members can then be 
assembled in place. Assembling within the shell requires 
special fixtures, machining dowel holes, the use of 
dowels, etc. to permit assembly of the very accurately 
machined parts. Thus, the assembly that takes place 
within the shell requires a complicated system for 
automatic assembly. The present invention is directed to assembling a pump 
cartridge as a subassembly of a scroll compressor. The 
pump cartridge is installed as a unit within the shell of 
the scroll compressor as part of the assembly of the 
scroll compressor. This permits easier automatic assembly 
of the very accurately made scroll members and a more 
precise alignment of the pump cartridge for more efficient 
and reliable operation of the scroll members. Further, 
since the pump cartridge includes the two scroll members, 
anti-rotation structure and crankcase, the pump cartridge 
can be tested prior to being installed in the shell. It is an object of this invention to eliminate the need 
for machining dowel holes for the assembly of a scroll 
compressor pump.  It is an additional object of this invention to permit the 
testing of a pump cartridge assembly prior to its 
installation in the shell. It is a further object of this invention to more precisely 
align a pump cartridge assembly for improved operation of 
the scroll members. It is another object of this invention to assemble a 
scroll compressor pump as a subassembly of a hermetic 
scroll compressor. These objects, and others as will 
become apparent hereinafter, are accomplished by the 
present invention. Basically, the fixed and orbiting scrolls, the crankcase 
and the anti-rotation structure are assembled to form a 
pump cartridge as a subassembly of a scroll compressor. The assembled pump cartridge is tested prior to its being 
placed in the shell of a scroll compressor as part of the 
assembly process. For a fuller understanding of the present invention, 
reference should now be made to the following detailed 
description thereof taken in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawings wherein;

A method of assembling a pump cartridge for 
a scroll compressor comprising the steps of: 

   locating a crankcase on an assembly fixture; 
   locating an Oldham coupling in operative 

engagement with the crankcase; 
   locating an orbiting scroll in operative 

engagement with the Oldham coupling and supported by the 
crankcase; 

   locating a fixed scroll in operative engagement 
with the orbiting scroll and supported by the crankcase; 

and 
   securing the fixed scroll to the crankcase to 

form a pump cartridge assembly. 
The method of claim 1 further including the 
steps of: 

   removing the pump cartridge assembly from the 
assembly fixture; 

   placing the pump cartridge assembly on a test 
fixture; 

   engaging a drive shaft to the pump cartridge 
assembly; 

   rotating the shaft; 
   determining if the pump cartridge assembly 

operates satisfactorily. 
The method of claim 2 further including the 
step of securing a pump cartridge assembly which operates 

satisfactorily in a hermetic shell of a scroll compressor. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of 
locating the fixed scroll further includes the step of 

angularly positioning the fixed scroll with respect to the 
crankcase. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of 
locating the fixed scroll further includes the steps of: 

   precisely aligning the fixed scroll on the 
crankcase; 

   measuring the position of the crankcase and 
fixed scroll; 

   relatively moving the crankcase and fixed scroll 
to a desired position based on the measurement. 
The method of claim 5 further including the 
steps of: 

   removing the pump cartridge assembly from the 
assembly fixture; 

   placing the pump cartridge assembly on a test 
fixture; 

   engaging a drive shaft to the pump cartridge 
assembly; 

   rotating the shaft; 
   determining if the pump cartridge assembly 

operates satisfactorily. 
The method of claim 6 further including the 
step of securing a pump cartridge assembly which operates 

satisfactorily in a hermetic shell of a scroll compressor. 
The method of claim 5 wherein the step of 
locating the fixed scroll further includes the step of 

angularly positioning the fixed scroll with respect to the 
crankcase.
