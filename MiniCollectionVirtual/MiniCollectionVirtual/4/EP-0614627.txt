<ABSTRACT>
In an item of jewellery, in particular made of metal, a solution is to be provided, with which a visual appearance which is different from that previously known is to be made possible by technical means in the shape of a corresponding item of jewellery with a novel appearance. This is achieved in that the item of jewellery is formed from a compressed entanglement of wires.

<CLAIMS>
Piece of jewellery, particularly of metal, made from a pressed piece of tangled wire, 
characterised in that the piece of jewellery provided with a recess, such as a ring for the finger, or 

a perforated disc or the like, can be shaped from a piece of tangled wire which is wound round a 
core (5) and which can be pressed over the core into an annular shape. 
Piece of jewellery according to Claim 1, characterised in that the tangle of wire is a 
braiding surrounding the pressing core. 
Piece of jewellery according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the compressed tangle 
of wire has gaps filled or grouted with a material different from the wire. 
Piece of jewellery according to Claim 3, characterised in that the filling material is an 
enamel. 
Piece of jewellery according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
tangle of wire is formed from at least two wires which differ in the type of material and/or 

thickness and/or method of processing. 
Piece of jewellery according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that at least 
certain regions of the surface of the piece of jewellery, by structure and/or undulating and/or 

serrated stamped surfaces in the pressing process, are correspondingly structured and/or 
undulating and/or serrated. 
Process for the production of a piece of jewellery provided with a recess, particularly of a 
ring for the finger, characterised in that onto a core (5) at least one wire braiding is shaped over a 

core length enabling a pressing operation to be performed and exceeding the thickness of the 
eventual piece of jewellery, the wire braiding then being compressed to an annular shape between 

a lower part (2) and an upper part within a tubular outer part (4). 
Process in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that the core (5) has about half the 
length of wire wound round it to form meander shapes or loops, after which the other half of the 

length of wire is used for braiding the loops or undulations of the first half of the length of wire, 
that braiding or fabric thus formed then being pressed.  

 
Process in accordance with Claim 7 or 8, characterised in that for the formation of 
structures and/or undulating and/or serrated surfaces use is made of corresponding shaped upper 

and/or lower parts.
