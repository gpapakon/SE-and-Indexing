<ABSTRACT>
A distributed acoustic reflection transducer has a reflection function comprising at least one sign change, i.e. it has at least one reflector (7) and generally a set of reflectors with a centre at a distance k  lambda /2 +  lambda /4 from the centre of the other reflectors,  lambda  being the wavelength corresponding to the operational centre frequency of the transducer. Said transducer may be used to produce surface wave filters for radio systems.

Distributed acoustic reflection surface wave transducer of the
DART type comprising a juxtaposition of emitting cells and of reflecting cells,


characterized in that
 it comprises:

at least one change of sign of the reflection function, that is
to say that it comprises at least one reflector whose centre is

a distance kλ/2 + λ/4 from the centre of the other reflectors
thus defining a cell with negative reflection (-R), λ being the

wavelength corresponding to the central frequency of
operation of the transducer and k a non-zero integer;
zones (11, 13) of cells with positive reflection, denoted by E,
R, each of these cells comprising at least one source (E) and

one reflector (R) that are such that the waves emitted by a
source (E), in a favoured direction X, and the waves reflected

by a reflector (R) in the said direction are in phase at the
central frequency of operation of the transducer;
zones (12) of cells with negative reflection comprising
reflecting cells (-R) such as above defined and in which the

reflected waves are in phase opposition with respect to the
waves emitted or reflected by the cells with positive

reflection, in the favoured direction X of propagation of the
wave, at the central frequency of operation of the transducer,
