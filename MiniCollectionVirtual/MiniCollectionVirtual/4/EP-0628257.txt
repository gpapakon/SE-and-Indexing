<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in complexing one or more free amino acids with a reducing sugar by means of a hydrothermal treatment carried out by cooking-extrusion with a feed substrate, which treatment leads to the condensation of an amino acid molecule and of a sugar molecule. The conditions of the treatment are adapted in order to make possible the initiation of a Maillard reaction between the two constituents and in order to limit this reaction to the early stages. The amino acids capable of being used can be lysine or methionine (lysine hydrochloride and DL-methionine respectively); the feed substrate can be lupin flour and the reducing sugar results from lactoserum (whey) powder. Such a process can be used for protecting synthetic amino acids with respect to ruminal degradation in dairy cows, for the purpose of increasing the proteinic (protein) level in milk especially.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the protection of a free amino acid against ruminal degradation, 
characterised in that it consists in complexing the said amino acid with a reducing sugar 

using a hydrothermal treatment conducted by boiling-extrusion with a feed support, 
whereby the said treatment causes condensation of a molecule of amino acid and of a 

molecule of sugar. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that it consists in applying a 
hydrothermal treatment to a mixture of amino acid(s) and of reducing sugar, whereas the 

conditions of the said treatment are suited in order to allow a MAILLARD's reaction to 
take place between both components and to limit this reaction to the precocious stages 

of the said MAILLARD's reaction. 
A process according to any of the claims 1 or 2, characterised in that it consists 
in preparing a mixture of amino acid(s) and of reducing sugar in proportions 

corresponding to an amino function for a carbonyl function. 
A process according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it consists 
in treating the mixture of amino acid(s) and of reducing sugar in a boiler-extruder for a 

time ranging between 15 and 25 seconds, under 80 bar pressure, at a die outlet 
temperature of 150Â°C and with a humidity rate of the mixture of 10 %. 
A process according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that it consists 
in differing the cooling of the mixture at the outlet of the extrusion die until the 

production of a light brown colour, typical of the presence of a MAILLARD's reaction. 
A feed complex liable to be obtained by the process according to any of the 
claims 1 to 5.  

 
A feed complex according to claim 6, characterised in that it comprises lupinus 
flour as feed support. 
A feed complex according to any of the claims 6 or 7, characterised in that it is 
obtained by using lactoserum powder to supply the reducing sugar. 
A feed complex according to claims 7 and 8, characterised in that it is obtained 
by boiling-extrusion of a mixture of lupinus flour, lysine hydrochloride, DL-methionine 

and lactoserum powder, in proportions meeting the requirements of the animals.
