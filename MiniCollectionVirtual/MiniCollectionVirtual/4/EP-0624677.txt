<ABSTRACT>
Textile webs which are to be dyed, printed or otherwise upgraded have to be fed to this treatment process in a clean state. For continuous cleaning without major apparatus and without harm to the environment, provision is made for impregnating the pile with a liquid containing wash-active agents and those which are brought to foaming under thermal action, especially under steam. After the steaming, only the foam occurring in the steam, together with the dirty substances carried by this foam, are then suction-extracted for cleaning purposes.

Method of cleaning continuously advancing, web-like
textile material, which is provided with a washing-active

fluid and includes a compound, which
has a high adsorbing power for the pollutants to be

washed-out and no affinity with the fibres of the textile
material, and also includes one or more surfactants,

then it is immediately subjected to a saturated
steam treatment, and it is finally removed from

the surface of the continuous material by suction,

characterised in that
 a liquid is available as the fluid,
and the textile material is steeped with this liquid,

the liquid containing chemicals for the formation of
foam only in a steam atmosphere, and 
in that
 the
textile material is conveyed into the steamer and

steamed there to produce the washing-active foam.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
,
in the case of a pile-type material, the pile side is

steeped with the liquid, and the foam, produced in
the steamer, is removed from the pile side by suction.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the textile material is steamed afresh after the
removal by suction.
Method according to claims 2 and 3, 
characterised
in that
 the second steaming operation is accomplished
without contact being made with the continuous

material on the pile side.
Apparatus for accomplishing the method according to one of
claims 1 - 4, 
characterised in that
 a liquid coating device
(4) for steeping with a washing-active liquid, which

contains chemicals to form foam in a steam atmosphere, is
disposed immediately upstream of a downwardly open

shaft-type steamer (1), which is known per se, for steaming
a continuously advancing web-like textile material to be

cleaned, and an extractor (5) for extracting the foam
produced in the steamer, together with the released dirt,

is disposed immediately downstream of said steamer.
Apparatus according to claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 the liquid coating device (4) is disposed beneath
the hood of the shaft-type steamer (1).
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised
in that
 the liquid coating device (4) comprises a bar
(10) with an upwardly open liquid discharge slot (9),

which extends over the working width, and via
which slot the textile material (2) with a downwardly

orientated pile (3) is guided.
Apparatus according to claim 7, 
characterised in 
that
 a pressure roller (11) is associated with the liquid
discharge slot (9) and lies adjacent thereto on

the rear side of the textile material (2).
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised
in that
, when viewed with respect to the direction of
conveyance of the textile material (2), a guide roller

extends behind the bar (10) beneath and parallel to
the bar for an upwardly orientated guidance of the

textile material (2), and a liquid coating device, such
as spray tube (15), is directed into the wedge between

guide roller (13) and the downwardly travelling
textile material (2).
Apparatus according to claim 9, 
characterised in
that
 the guide roller (13) is surrounded at its lower
end by a bath housing (13') to form an immersion

trough.
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 - 10, having
a steamer with a guide roller, which is possibly driven,

disposed beneath the top thereof for guiding the
continuous material which is guided in an upwardly

and downwardly travelling loop, 
characterised in
that
 a second guide roller (26) is disposed above
the previously mentioned guide roller
 (16), a second
upwardly and downwardly guided loop of the continuous

material (2) being guided over said second
guide roller.
Apparatus according to claim 11, having a guide
roller, which is provided at the lower outlet end of

the first loop, for forming the downwardly travelling
portion of the loop, 
characterised in that
 an additional
roller (27) is disposed substantially horizontally

adjacent this guide roller (18), and the upwardly
orientated extractor (5) is disposed between said

rollers.
Apparatus according to claim 12, 
characterised in
that
 a liquid supply means, such as spray tube (28),
is associated with the wedge between the guide roller

(18) and the downwardly travelling textile material
(2) so as to spray in a parallel orientated manner

over the working width.
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 - 13, 
characterised
in that
 the outlet end wall (21) of the
steamer (1), disposed parallel to the continuous

material (2), terminates higher than the steamer
wall (20) at the inlet side, and a suction hood (22)

is disposed on this wall (21) and above a roller (19,
19'), which controls the extraction speed.
