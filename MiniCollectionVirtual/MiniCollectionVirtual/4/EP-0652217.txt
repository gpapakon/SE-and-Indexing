<ABSTRACT>
The N-substituted imidazole derivatives of the following 
formula (1) 


wherein A is 

X is -O-, -NHCO- or -NH-, 1 is an integer of 2 to 6; m is 0 or 1; n 
is 1 or 2;ring α, ring β and ring γ are independently 

unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents selected from 
the group consisting of a halogen atom, C₁ ~ C₃ 

alkyl, C₁ ~ C₃ alkoxy and cyano; 
or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or their hydrates, 

show excellent anti-hypertensive, anti-hyperlipemic and 
blood sugar lowering activity, and are useful as excellent 

antihypertensives, preventives or remedies for ischemic cardiac 

diseases such as angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, 
arteriosclerosis, or as preventives or remedies for diabetes and 

complications thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to N-substituted imidazole 
derivatives. More particularly, it relates to N-substituted imidazole 
derivatives having hypoglycemic hypolipidaemic and antihypertensive 
activity. Hypertension is an important risk factor in circulatory 
diseases. Recently, development of various types of depressors has 
made it relatively easy to lower blood pressure level of hypertensive 
patients. Up to date, however, administration of such depressors do 
not reduce incidence of myocardial infarction and sudden death. 
Accordingly, development of depressors which reduce incidence of 
myocardial infarction and sudden death has been expected. The present inventors have studied intensively to provide novel 
drugs for circulatory diseases to reduce incidence of myocardial 
infarction or sudden death. As the results, we have found that N-substituted 
imidazole derivatives of the present invention have 
hypoglycemic, hypolipidaemic and anti-hypertensive activity, and 
have attained the present invention. That is, the present invention provides N-substituted imidazole 
derivatives of the following general formula (I):  wherein A is 
X is -O-, -NHCO- or -NH-, 1 is an integer of 2 to 6; m is 0 or 1; n is 1 
or 2; ring α, ring β and ring γ are independently unsubstituted or 
substituted by one or more substituents selected from the group 
consisting of a halogen atom, C₁ ∼ C₃ alkyl, C₁ ∼ C₃ alkoxy and cyano; 
or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or hydrates thereof. The present invention will be explained in detail. In the compounds represented by the above general formula (I), 
C₁ ∼ C₃ alkyl groups substitutable on rings α, β and γ include, for 
example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, preferably methyl. The 
position of substitution is particularly preferably at 2-position of an 
imidazole ring represented by ring β. C₁ ∼ C₃ Alkoxy groups substitutable on rings α, β and γ 
include, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, 
preferably methoxy. The position of substitution is preferably at 3 or 
6-position of a benzene ring represented by ring α. Halogen atoms substitutable on rings α, β and γ include, for 
example, fluorine, chlorine and bromine, preferably chlorine. The 
position of cyano group substituted on rings α, β and γ is preferably 
4- and 5-positions of an imidazole ring represented by ring β.  All of ring α, ring β and ring γ are more preferably 
unsubstituted. A is preferably 
X is preferably -O- or 
-NHCO-, more preferably -O-. The preferred compounds according to
