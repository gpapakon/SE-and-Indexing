<ABSTRACT>
An oil filter having a spring-biased valve (5). The oil filter 
includes a rolled filter (7) constructed of a moisture-endurable 

paper rolled around moisture-endurable mandrel (72). The spring-biased 
valve (5) is received in an adjusting cylinder (3) and 

upwardly biased by a spring (4). This valve (5) is threaded (at 
52) on its outer surface and has a spring seat (54) on its bottom 

end, which spring seat (54) seats the top of the spring (4) 
thereon. The valve (5) normally blocks oil adjusting ports (32) 

of the adjusting cylinder (3) screwed to the center of the filter 
canister (1) but naturally opens the oil adjusting port (32) so 

as to allow the oil to flow through the oil outlet when the oil 
pressure applied on the valve (5) is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to lubrication 
oil filters such as used in internal combustion engines of 
automobiles, heavy construction vehicles, vessels and electric 
generators and, more particularly, to structural improvement 
in such oil filters for prevention of insufficient oil 
circulation possibly generated such as in acceleration, long 
time running and winter time running of the internal 
combustion engines, for prevention of instable operation or 
sudden stop of oil filter valves caused by impurity-laden 
lubrication oil, for saving of management cost of the oil 
filter by allowing only a filter of the oil filter to be 
exchanged with new one, for prevention of waste of oil by 
allowing only the amount of oil corresponding to the oil 
impregnated in the filter to be added in exchange of oil, and 
for prevention of environmental pollution. With reference to Fig. 9, there is shown a typical oil 
filter in a sectional view. The typical lubrication oil 
filter includes a cylindrical canister 101 that is covered  
 
with a lid 104 having both an oil outlet 102 and an oil inlet 
103. Vertically placed in the canister 101 is a cylindrical 
pleated filter 105. This pleated filter 105 is tightly placed 
between top and bottom filter support plates 106. Here, the 
top plate 106 is an annular plate while the bottom plate 
constitutes a bottom fixing plate 107 that is provided with a 
center through hole 108. The center through hole 108 of the 
bottom fixing plate 107 is normally blocked by a spring-biased 
valve 110. This valve 110 is biased downwardly by a 
compression coil spring 109. When stopping an internal 
combustion engine (not shown), the oil is discharged to the 
outside of the oil filter through the oil inlet 103. 
Therefore, the oil can not be supplied to the engine for a 
time until the oil reaches the engine when starting the engine 
and this may cause the engine to be overloaded. In order to prevent discharge of oil from the oil filter 
during stopping of the engine, the oil inlet 103 may be 
provided with a check valve 111 made of rubber. However, the 
rubber check valve 111 has a problem in that it can not assure 
reliable checking operation and can not achieve its intended 
operational effect. It has been noted that large amount of oil needs to be 
rapidly supplied to the engine when the engine should be 
accelerated or run in winter time. However, since the 
cooperation of the valve 110 with the spring 109 is not  
 
smoothly achieved, the valve 110 normally blocking the
