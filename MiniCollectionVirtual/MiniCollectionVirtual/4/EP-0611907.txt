<ABSTRACT>
A fluid check valve of the two flapper variety which has 
replaceable seat flapper assembly. The assembly (18) 

comprises a tubular ring (22) having a seating area (42) 
on the surface of one end and a reduced diameter portion 

on the other end. A pair of pin keepers (24) are attached 
to opposite sides of the seat ring (22) and the flappers 

(26) are pivotably attached to a pin (30) that passes 
through holes (32) in the keepers (24). Preferably the 

pivot holes (32) in the keepers (24) or the pivot holes 
(34) in the flappers (26) or both are elongated to allow 

movement of the flappers (26) along the valve axis. The 
seat ring (22) is a sliding fit in the bore (20) of the 

valve body (10) and abuts against an annular rib (16) in 
the valve body bore (20). The reduced diameter portion 

of the seat ring (22) extends through the annular rib 
(16). A retaining ring (62) is attached to the reduced 

diameter portion by threaded engagement, bolts, or other 
means and tightened until it abuts against the other 

side of the annular rib (16) thus holding the seat ring 
(22) in tight assembly in the valve bore (20) against 

the rib (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid check valve according 
to the preamble of claim 1 and to 
a replaceable valve seat and flapper 
assembly according to the preamble of 
claim 5. In 
previous types of double-flapper check valves, hinge and stop 
pins are installed through holes which extend through the wall 
of the Valve body. After installation of the pins, the holes are 
sealed by plugs or other means. While initially effective, there 
is a possibility of leakage from the inside to the outside past 
the seals. Another disadvantage of the previous designs is that the 
flappers are free to move sideways in the bore. This sideways 
movement causes extra wear on the wall of the flapper hinge or 
bushing, depending upon actual design. One modification made to avoid holes through the wall is to 
mount pins in inserts which fit into cavities machined into the 
inner surface of the body wall. These inserts are retained in 
place by various means. U.S. Patent 4,694,853 describes and 
illustrates the various embodiments in which hinge pins and stop 
pins are mounted in insert position in recesses in the body wall.  
 Although holes through the body wall are eliminated, and 
thus also potential leak paths, the modifications using inserts 
are expensive to manufacture and the design can restrict the 
particular type of gasket that can be used. Thinning of the wall 
occurs, which is not desirable. Also, the holes through the 
inserts for the hinge pins are round and permit sideways movement 
of the hinge pins which causes wear and increased maintenance.  
 Another fluid check valve known from DE-A-30 01 461 comprises a tubular 
valve body, a seat ring and keepers for pivotally mounting flappers on the 
seat ring. The keepers which extend axially from the seat ring are integrally 
formed with the seat ring. To secure the seat ring in its position in the body first and second grooves are 
provided in the mating surfaces of the seat ring and the valve body. An 
annular holding element is arranged between the body and the seat ring 
within both the first and second grooves. The object of the present invention is to provide a fluid check valve as well 
as a valve seat and flapper assembly for a fluid check valve of the initially 
named kind which can be easily and economically manufactured and 
maintained. This object is achieved by the check valve according to claim 1 and the valve 
seat and flapper assembly according to claim 5. The separate retaining ring, clamping the seat ring down against a ledge in 
the valve
