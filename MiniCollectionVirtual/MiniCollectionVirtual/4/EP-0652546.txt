<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
liquid crystal display capable of changing the polarities of 

voltages to be applied to a liquid crystal for every scanning 
lines, so as to correct viewing angle characteristics. 

The liquid crystal display of the present invention comprises: 
a circuit (10) for generating a view angle correcting 

signal on the basis of a vertical scanning signal which is 
generated by a pulse at the scanning start of one field; 

circuits (12, 14) for converting the viewing angle correcting 
signal into an AC signal by changing its polarity for 

every scanning lines; and a driver for generating a video 
signal from the AC viewing angle correcting signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal
display and, more particularly, to a liquid crystal
display to be used in a projection type display for
projecting a liquid crystal display panel in an enlarged
scale, that is, a liquid crystal display having
a function to correct that luminance difference in the
vertical direction of the screen, which is caused by
the viewing angle.In the liquid crystal display of the prior art, 
the polarities of the voltages to be applied to the
liquid crystal are inverted for each field and in adjoining
video signal lines. Moreover, the phenomenon
that the luminance changes in the viewing direction of
the display panel is prevented by changing the display
luminance in the vertical scanning direction, i.e., by
correcting the so-called "viewing angle characteristics".Specifically, a correcting signal is generated,
for example, by differentiating and integrating the
liquid crystal applied signals having their polarities
inverted for each one field and is applied to the liquid
crystal of each scanning line.This concept of the prior art is disclosed in
Patent Publications such as U.S.P. 4,906,984 and Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 59-220,797 (on December 12,
1984).In the prior art described above, the display
characteristics such as the flicker of the display
screen or the crosstalk to be produced vertically of
the screen can be improved by inverting the polarities
of the liquid crystal applied voltages for every scanning
lines. In case, however, a viewing angle correcting 
signal is to be generated merely by differentiating
and integrating the signals having their polarities
changing for every scanning lines, the viewing
angle characteristics cannot be corrected because
the effective voltage values of the liquid crystal applied
signals will not change for every scanning
lines. Moreover, no prior art has succeeded in specifically
disclosing the concept of inverting the polarities
of the liquid crystal applied voltages for every
scanning lines by using the signal for correcting the
viewing angle.On the basis of this background, therefore, the
present invention has been conceived and has an object
to provide a liquid crystal display for changing the
polarities of the liquid crystal applied voltages for
every scanning lines, which display has its display
characteristics such as the flicker in the display
screen or the crosstalk in the vertical direction of
the screen improved by disclosing a specific liquid
crystal display driver enabled to invert the polarities
of the liquid
