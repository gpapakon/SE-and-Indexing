<ABSTRACT>
Protons (23) are ion-implanted into that region 
(22) of an N
-
-type base layer (16) of a silicon 
substrate (13) which is not depleted when a peak voltage 

V
DM
 is applied to a thyristor in order to turn off the 
thyristor, at an incident angle of 0°, using an 

amorphous aluminum absorber, with the result that an 
effective defect region (24) is formed in the N
-
-type 
base layer. The effective defect region (24) is formed 

throughout the region of the N
-
-type base layer (16), 
which is not depleted. The carrier lifetime of the 

entire silicon substrate (13) is shortened by electron 
beam irradiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a GTO thyristor 
and, more particularly, to a GTO thyristor capable of 
shortening turnoff time. In a conventional power device such as a high 
withstanding-voltage GTO thyristor and a reverse blocking 
GTO thyristor, EBI (Electron Beam Irradiation) has 
generally been performed in order to control carrier 
lifetime. The characteristic advantage of the EBI is to 
uniformly decrease the carrier lifetime of the entire N-type 
base layer. As another method for controlling the 
carrier lifetime, ion implantation of, for example, proton 
and helium has recently been employed. The advantage 
of the ion implantation is to form a short-lifetime 
layer locally in an N-type base layer and, in other 
words, to allow the carrier distribution of an N-type 
base layer to be locally controlled. FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing a first 
conventional shorted anode GTO thyristor. As shown in 
FIG. 1, a silicon substrate 1 includes a P-type emitter 
layer 2, an N-type base layer 3, and P-type base layer 
4. An N-type emitter layer 5 is formed in the P-type 
base layer 4, and an N-type anode short-circuiting layer 
3a is formed in the P-type emitter layer 2. An anode 
aluminum electrode 6 is provided on the undersurfaces of 
the N-type anode short-circuiting layer 3a and P-type 
emitter layer 2, and an anode aluminum electrode 7 is  
 
provided on the N-type emitter layer 5. A gate aluminum 
electrode 8 is provided on the P-type base layer 4. The thickness of the N-type base layer 3 is set to 
several hundreds of micrometers in order to increase a 
withstanding voltage. The lifetime of the entire N-type 
base layer 3 is reduced uniformly by irradiating the 
entire N-type base layer 3 with electron beams. In the first conventional shorted anode GTO 
thyristor, a turnoff loss can be lessened since the N-type 
base layer 3 is increased in thickness and its 
lifetime is shortened, but an on-state voltage is 
increased. It is more desirable to decrease the on-state 
voltage as much as possible in order to reduce a 
power loss of the thyristor. The above turnoff loss is represented by a multiplication 
of tail current Itail and voltage VT. The 
tail current Itail has only to be reduced to lessen 
the turnoff loss. The tail current Itail can be 
reduced by shortening the carrier lifetime of the N-type 
base layer 3. To shorten the turnoff time, the carrier 
lifetime has to be shortened. The on-state voltage of 
the thyristor is controlled by the carriers stored in 
the N-type base layer 3
