<ABSTRACT>
An air-tube conveyor comprising a sending station (12) at which a carrier (14) enters the conveyor, and, an elongate conveyor tube (11) extending from the sending station and along which the carrier is conveyed in use, a tube region within the sending station having an elongate gap (21) in the wall thereof corresponding in length to the length of the carrier, the sending station having inlet means spaced laterally from the axis of said tube region for the introduction of a carrier, and, the sending station being arranged to convey a carrier introduced at said inlet, laterally with respect to said tube region axis, to introduce the carrier in an orientation substantially parallel to said tube region axis through said gap into said tube region.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PNEUMATIC CONVEYOR DISPATCHERTechnical FieldThis invention relates to conveyors of the kind wherein an elongate hollow carrier is transported between a sending station and a receiving station, along a hollow tube joining the stations, by a flow of air within the tube.Conveyors of the kind defined above are often known as air-tube conveyors and are well known. A consideration which is recognised in air-tube conveyor design is the minimum bend radius which is acceptable in the tube. Clearly if the tube bend radius is too tight the carrier will jam at the bend and if the radius is too large there may be wastage of tube material, and difficulty in accommodating the tubework within a building construction.Background ArtIn a conventional air-tube conveyor system where a sending station is adjacent a working position, such as a supermarket check-out desk, it is convenient to be able manually to insert carriers axially into what is effectively an open end of the tube. Where the main tube run leaving the working position is accommodated below floor level it will be recognised that a bend must be provided in the tube between a vertical, or substantially vertical tube section leading downwardly from the sending station and the tube run extending beneath floor level. Given the minimum bend radius requirement either a significant proportion of the bend must extend above floor level, or, the main tube run must be set sufficiently deeply below floor level to accommodate the bend of the tube within the floor structure. Aesthetic; 

safety; and space utilisation constraints normally dictate the deep burial option even though it is more costly to provide, in a floor structure, a sufficiently deep trench to instal the tube run. There are however occasions when it is impossible to provide a trench of the necessary depth. It is an object of the present invention to provide an air-tube conveyor wherein this problem is obviated. While the conveyor to be disclosed herein overcomes the aforemention problems its use is not restricted to those environments where deep burial of the main tube run is impossible, and it may find advantage in many other air-tube conveyor installation environments.Disclosure of Invention.In accordance with the present invention there is provided an air-tube conveyor comprising a sending station at which a carrier enters the conveyor, and, an elongate conveyor tube extending from the sending station and along which the carrier is conveyed in use, a tube region within the sending station having an

CLAIMS
1- An air- ube conveyor comprising a sending station (12) at which a carrier (14) enters the conveyor, and, an elongate conveyor tube (11) extending from the sending station (12) and along which the carrier is conveyed in use, there being a tube region within the sending station having an elongate gap in the wall thereof corresponding in length to the length of the carrier, the conveyor being characterized in that the sending station (12) has inlet means spaced laterally from the axis of said tube region for the introduction of a carrier (14) , and, the sending station is arranged to convey a carrier introduced at said inlet, laterally with respect to said tube region axis, to introduce the carrier in an orientation substantially parallel to said tube region axis through said gap into said tube region.
2. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said sending station has a movable receiver (34; 41) for carrying the carrier (14) into said tube region.
3. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that said receiver (34) is movable bodily, vertically in use, to carry the carrier (14) into said tube region.
4. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that said receiver (41) is pivoted so as to carry said carrier (14) through an arc from an inlet position at an angle to the axis of said tube region to enter said tube region parallel to the axis thereof.
5. A conveyor claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said sending station includes guide means (18; 33, 36; 51) extending at right angles to said tube region between the inlet location of the sending station and said tube region, said guide means being arranged to 


guide a carrier (14) for movement between the inlet location and the tube region with the longitudinal axis of the carrier parallel to the axis of said tube region.
6. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that said guide means (18, 51) guides the carrier for movement under gravity.
7. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that said gap (21) in the wall of said tube region is substantially equal in length to the carrier length and at the upstream end of the gap in relation to the direction of movement of the carrier (14) along the tube, there is provided a deflector (22) engaged by the trailing end of the carrier as the carrier passes through the gap, the deflector ensuring that the leading end of the carrier enters the tube region, and the deflector simultaneously imparting longitudinal movement to the carrier so that as the carrier passes through the gap it is moved lengthwise of the tube region.
8. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by including means for sealing the tube region against inlet of air from the sending station when the sending station is not active in the conveying of a carrier.
9. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the sending station includes a carrier receiver (24) for receiving a carrier (14) with its axis parallel to and spaced from the axis of said tube region, and means for rotating the receiver (24) about its longitudinal axis to release said carrier for movement laterally of said tube region through the gap thereof.
10. A conveyor as claimed in Claim 9, characterized in that said receiver (24) is mounted in a cabinet (18) spaced from said tube region and seats, in a rest 


position, against seal means (62, 63) to seal the cabinet (18) to prevent flow of air into said tube region by way of the cabinet, there being drive means for moving said receiver (24) dispense a carrier placed in the receiver, through the tube region gap (21) , and said drive means, when operative, displacing the receiver away from said seal means (62, 63) prior to rotating the receiver to dispense the carrier.
