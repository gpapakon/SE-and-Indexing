<ABSTRACT>
Oligonucleotides are provided which are capable of antisense interaction with messenger RNA of papillomavirus. Such oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide analogs can be used for diagnostics and therapeutics as well as for research purposes. In accordance with preferred embodiments of this invention, oligonucleotides are provided which are hybridizable with selected messenger RNA from a human papillomavirus. The oligonucleotide is able to inhibit the function of the RNA, and accordingly is useful for therapy for infections by such papillomavirus. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, portions of the papillomavirus are targeted for antisense attack. Thus, oligonucleotides are preferably provided which hybridize with the E2, E6 and E7 messenger RNAs.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE INHIBITION OF PAPILLOMAVIRUSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the inhibition of papillomavirus and the diagnosis and treatment of infections in animals caused by papillomavirus. This invention is also directed to the detection and quantitation of papillomavirus in samples suspected of containing it. Additionally, this invention is directed to oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs which interfere with or modulate the function of messenger RNA from papillomavirus. Such interference can be employed as a means of diagnosis and treatment of papillomavirus infections. It can also form the basis for research reagents and for kits both for research and for diagnosis.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe papillomaviruses (PV) are widespread in nature and are generally associated with benign epithelial and fibroepithelial lesions commonly referred to as warts. They have been detected in and isolated from a variety of higher vertebrates including human, cattle, rabbits, deer and several avian species. Although these viruses are generally associated with benign lesions, a specific subset of the viruses have been associated with lesions that may progress 

 to carcinomas. The implication that these viruses may play an etiologic role in the development of some human cancers follows from numerous studies that have shown the presence of transcriptionally activehumanpapillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribo- nucleic acids in a high percentage of certain cancerous lesions. Zur Hausen, H. and Schneider, A. 1987. In: The Papovaviridae, vol. 2, edited by N. P. Salzman and P. M. Howley, pp. 245-264. Plenum Press, New York.In man, human papillomaviruses cause a variety of disease including common warts of the hands and feet, laryngeal warts and genital warts. More than 57 types of HPV have been identified so far. Each HPV type has a preferred anatomical site of infection; each virus can generally be associated with a specific lesion. Genital warts, also referred to as venereal warts and condylomata acuminata, are one of the most serious manifestations of PV infection. As reported by the Center for Disease Control, the sexual mode of transmission of genital warts is well established and the incidence of genital warts is on the increase. The seriousness of genital warts is underlined by the recent discovery that HPV DNA can be found in all grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III) and that a specific subset of HPV types can be found in carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Consequently,

CLAIMS What is claimed is:
1. An antisense oligonucleotide comprising from 8 to 50 nucleotides, hybridizable with the translation initiation region of a human papillomavirus E2 transactivator messenger RNA that inhibits the function of said messenger RNA when hybridized therewith.
2. An antisense oligonucleotide of claim 1 having at least one phosphorothioate internucleotide bond. 3. An antisense oligonucleotide having SEQ ID NO: 7.
4. An antisense oligonucleotide comprising from 8 to 50 nucleotides, hybridizable with the translation initiation region of the E6 or E7 messenger RNA of a human papillomavirus that inhibits the function of said messenger RNA when hybridized therewith.
5. An antisense oligonucleotide of claim 4 having at least one phosphorothioate internucleotide bond.
6. An antisense oligonucleotide of claim 5 having SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 9.
7. A method of regulation of growth of cancer cells that carry human papillomavirus comprising contacting cancer cells that carry human papillomavirus with an antisense oligonucleotide of claim 4. 8. A method of regulation of growth of cancer cells that carry human papillomavirus comprising contacting cancer cells that carry human papillomavirus with an antisense oligonucleotide of claim 5.
9. A method of regulation of growth of cancer cells that carry human papillomavirus comprising contacting cancer cells that carry human papillomavirus with an antisense oligonucleotide of claim 6.
