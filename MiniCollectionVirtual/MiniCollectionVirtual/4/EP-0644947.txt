<DESCRIPTION>
One approach towards manipulating the immune system is based on idiotypic
interactions. The unique antigenic determinants in and around the antigen-combining site
of an Ig molecule which make one antibody distinct from another are defined as
idiotopes. The totality of all idiotopes present on the variable portion of a given antibody
is referred to as its idiotype (id). The molecular structure of an idiotype has been
localized to both the complementarity determining regions and the framework regions of
the variable domain and is generally but not always contributed to by both the heavy and
the light chains in specific association.Idiotypes are serologically defined entities since injection of an antibody (often referred
to as Ab1) into a syngeneic, allogeneic, or xenogeneic recipient induces the production
of anti-idiotypic antibodies (often referred to as Ab2). Based on the assumption that
idiotype/anti-idiotype interactions exist, physiologically a receptor-based regulation of the
immune system was postulated by Niels Jerne (Ann. Immunol. 125C, 373, 1974). His
network theory views the immune system as a collection of Ig molecules and receptors
on T-lymphocytes, each capable of recognizing an antigenic determinant (epitope)
through Its combining site (paratope), and each capable of being recognized by other
antibodies or cell-surface receptors of the system through the idiotopes that it displays.
Many studies have indeed demonstrated that idiotypic and anti-idiotypic receptors are
present on the surface of both B- and T-lymphocytes as well as on secreted antibodies.When the binding between Ab1 and Ab2 is inhibited by the antigen to which Ab1 is
directed, the idiotype is considered to be binding-site-related, since it involves a site on
the antibody variable domain that is engaged in antigen recognition. Those idiotypes
which conformationally mimic an antigenic epitope are called the internal image of that
epitope. Since both an Ab2 and an antigen bind to the relevant Ab1, they may share a
similar three-dimensional conformation which represents the internal image of the given
antigen. Internal image anti-idiotypic antibodies in principle can be seen as substitute of
the antigen from which they have been derived via the idiotypic network. Therefore these
surrogate antigens may be used in active immunization protocols. For example they offer 
advantages if the original antigen is not sufficiently immunogenic to induce a significant
immune response. Thus, appropriate internal image anti-idiotypic antibodies
