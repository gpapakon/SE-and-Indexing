<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a retainer for a 
poppet of a control valve of a brake booster. The 
retainer has a series of grooves for directing air around 
a return spring to prevent the creation of turbulence in 
the air when an input member moves a plunger away from 
the poppet. The turbulent free air after passing through 
the poppet is presented to a chamber where a pressure 
differential is created to develop a uniform output force 
and effect a smooth brake application. In brake boosters, such as illustrated in U.S. 
Patent 4,953,446 and German Patent DE-A-2 417 384, a 
pressure differential is created across a wall that 
separates a vacuum chamber from a control chamber. The 
pressure differential acts on the wall to develop an 
output force corresponding to an input force applied to a 
control valve. The control valve includes a return 
spring which urges a plunger toward an atmospheric seat 
on a poppet member and a seat spring to urge the poppet 
toward a vacuum seat. The input force is applied to the 
push rod which compresses the return spring to move the 
plunger and sequentially allow the seat spring to seat 
the poppet member on the vacuum seat and the plunger to 
move away from the poppet member to thereafter allow air 
to flow to the control chamber. The distance that the 
push rod moves before the flow of air occurs through the 
poppet has an effect on the speed of response to effect a 
brake application. In U.S. Patent 4,953,446 a key member 
positions the plunger and correspondingly the valve seat 
such that the poppet spring urges the poppet into 
engagement with the vacuum seat when the control valve is 
in the rest position. It is known that the communication of air 
through the poppet can effect the uniform development of 
a pressure differential and as shown in U.S. Patent 
4,953,446 a contoured surface is placed on the push rod  
 
to reduce the development of turbulence in the air that 
is supplied to the control chamber. In analyzing the operation of brake boosters it 
has been observed that air supplied to the control 
chamber must pass through the coils of the return spring 
before reaching the seat of the poppet. When an input 
force is applied to the push rod, the coils are 
compressed and as a result the flow of air is restricted 
an turbulance can occur in the air supplied to the 
control control valve. In the present invention, a retainer holds the 
poppet member of the control valve in a bore of a hub 
while positioning the return spring connected to an input 
member

<CLAIMS>
A brake booster (10) having a control valve (40) located in a bore (30) to control 
communication of a first fluid between a first chamber (18) and a second chamber (20) and of a 

second fluid from said bore (30) and said second chamber (20) to create a pressure differential 
across a movable wall (22), said control valve (40) having a plunger (42), a poppet member 

(48) located in said bore (30) by a retainer (70), a first spring (74) connected to said retainer 
(70) for urging said poppet member (49) toward a seat (43) to control communication between 

said bore (30) and second chamber (20) and a return spring (72) located between a retainer 
(70) and an input member (50) for urging a plunger (42) toward a poppet member (48) to 

control communication between said first chamber (18) and said second chamber (20), said 
retainer (70) being characterized by a cylindrical body (100) having a series of axial slots 

formed by a plurality of walls (108, 108'...108N) that extend from a first end (102) to an 
annual wall (104), said axial slots directly communicating substantially turbulent free air to said 

poppet member (48) for distribution to said chamber (20) when an input force moves said 
plunger (42) away from said poppet member (48). 
A brake booster (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said communication of 
turbulent free air through said bore (30) primarily occurs without passing through said return 

spring (72). 
A brake booster (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said retainer (70) is further 
characterized by a first groove (106) for retaining a first bead (47) of said poppet member (48) 

in said bore (30) and a second groove (118) for retaining a poppet spring (74), said poppet 
spring (74) urging a face (49) on a movable section of said poppet member (48) toward said 

plunger (42) and a seat (31). 
A brake booster (10) as recited in claim 3 wherein each of said radial walls (108, 
108'...108N) are characterized by a peripherial face (110) that extends on a slope from said 

first end (102) to an annular ledge (112) that forms an annular shoulder adjacent said second 
end (104), said return spring (72) being caged between said annular shoulder and a shoulder 

(51) on said input member (50). 
A brake booster (10) as recited in claim 4 wherein said end wall (104) is 
characterized by a plurality of slope surfaces (114, 114'...114N) that aid in directing air from 

the slots to said poppet member (42) without turbulence. 
A brake booster (10) having a control valve (40) located in a bore (30) of a 
cylindrical projection (28) extending from a hub member (24), said hub member (24) being 

connected to a wall (22) which divides the interior of the brake booster (10) into a front 
chamber (18) and a rear chamber (20), said control valve (40) responding to an input force for
