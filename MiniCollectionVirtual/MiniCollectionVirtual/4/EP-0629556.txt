<ABSTRACT>
Pallet-holder cradle consisting of: a rectangular 
base formed of at least two longitudinal members (2), and 

of a number of cross members (3) perpendicular thereto, 
on which there is supported a surface (6), and of two 

pairs of box elements (5) which are disposed at the ends 
of the surface (6), parallel to the cross members (3), 

four support legs connected to the base in the vicinity 
of the corners, there being inserted in these legs a 

corresponding number of tubes (41) in which the box 
elements (5) and the surface (6) together delimit a 

recess for accommodating a pallet (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to loading pallets, commonly 
known as pallets, for forklift trucks, and in particular 
to a base for accommodating them, hereafter termed a 
pallet-holder cradle. The use of these pallets in stores is known: 
materials in various types of packaging are loaded onto 
the pallets with a greater or lesser degree of 
compactness on the pallets such that during storage of 
the material, they are maintained disposed in this manner 
on the pallet, thus permitting quick removal when they 
have to be moved from the store; this removal will also 
be carried out by means of the forklift trucks. However there are disadvantages in this type of 
system of organizing the material stored. Thus the 
pallets have standard dimensions (UNI 4121), and this 
means that whenever goods with dimensions greater than 
those of the pallet must be disposed on the latter, 
particularly in the case of very long packages of approximately 
2 m, the goods will project from the pallet at 
both ends. When the material must be stored under this 
type of condition for some time, it can easily be 
predicted that a storage situation of this kind will 
inevitably lead to deterioration of the material stored, 
with substantially mechanical deformations caused by the 
precarious situation of storage itself. In order to remedy this situation larger pallets 
have been tried, but these involve disadvantages 
concerning their management in a store, and owing to the 
fact that they exceed the aforementioned standard 
dimensions. The object of the invention is to eliminate 
this type of disadvantage by means of a storage system 
which uses ordinary pallets, and which permits storage of  
 
goods of dimensions larger than those of the pallets. This can be achieved by means of a pallet-holder 
cradle consisting of:
 
a rectangular base formed of at least two longitudinal 
members, and of a number of cross members perpendicular 
thereto, on which there is supported a surface, and of 
two pairs of box elements, preferably made of metal 
plate, which are disposed at the ends of the surface, 
parallel to the cross members, four support legs, which 
are provided with bell-shaped support feet and are 
connected to the base in the vicinity of the corners, 
there being inserted in the legs a corresponding number 
of tubes for supporting the material to be stored, in 
which the box elements together with the surface form a 
recess for accommodating a pallet, the height of the box 
elements being substantially the same as that of the 
pallet.

Pallet-holder cradle consisting of: 
a rectangular base formed of at least two longitudinal 

members (2), and of a number of cross members (3) 
perpendicular thereto, on which there is supported a 

surface (6), and of two pairs of box elements (5) which 
are disposed at the ends of the surface (6), parallel to 

the cross members (3), four support legs (4) which are 
provided with support feet (42), and are connected to the 

base in the vicinity of the corners, there being inserted 
in these legs a corresponding number of tubular uprights 

(41) in which the box elements (5) and the surface (6) 
together delimit a recess for accommodating a pallet 

(20), the height (h) of the box elements (5) being 
substantially the same as that of the pallet (20). 
Pallet-holder cradle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the support feet (42) are bell-shaped 

tubes, and two or more cradles (1) can be stacked 
on one another during the storage of the material, by 

inserting the tubes (41) of one cradle in the bell-shaped 
feet (42) of a second cradle. 
Pallet-holder cradle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that on the lower surface of each 

longitudinal member (2) there is a pair of L-shaped 
elements (7) which guide the forks of a forklift truck. 
Pallet-holder cradle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that when the tubes (41) have been 

removed from the cradles (1), the latter can be stored 
stacked. 
Pallet-holder cradle according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the surface (6) and the box 

elements (5) are preferably made of metal plate.
