<CLAIMS>
Process for extracting an antioxidant from a vegetable
substance in liquid form, characterized in that vegetable

matter rich in antioxidants is put into contact with an oil
acting as a vehicle, that the said oil is liquid at ambient

temperature, that it constitutes a good solvent for the
antioxidant principles and that it is not sensitive to

oxidation, that the mixture is then pressed at a pressure
greater than or equal to 40 bar and filtered, whilst it is

pressed, to remove suspended solids without eliminating the
oil used.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
starting vegetable matter used is any spice containing

phenolic antioxidants, in particular rosemary, sage, thyme,
marjoram, savory, ginger, turmeric, pimento or cocoa bean

skins alone or in a mixture.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
oil used as the vehicle is selected from a mixture of

saturated C6-C12 saturated fatty acid triglycerides, olive
oil, a hybrid safflower or sunflower oil or a hydrogenated

and fractionated non-lauric cottonseed or soya bean
vegetable oil.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
vegetable raw material and the oil are mixed at room

temperature to retain the aromatic principles.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
vegetable raw material and the oil are mixed at a high

temperature of 100 to 140°C and preferably at approximately
120°C.
Process according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that pretreatment is carried out in the presence of water, 

by preferably adding approximately 10 % by weight of water,
based on the vegetabl
e matter, to the mixture.
Process according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that the raw material is subjected to an enzymatic

pretreatment by incubating it with a glucanase in an
aqueous medium, filtering or centrifuging the suspension

and drying the vegetable matter thus treated.
Process according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in
that the ratio by weight of oil to vegetable matter is 0.3

to 0.7.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that
pressing is carried out in a piston press equipped with a

filtration cage enabling pressing and filtration to be
carried out in a single operation.
