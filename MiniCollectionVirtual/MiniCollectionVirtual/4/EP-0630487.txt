A method of representing a work area in a three-dimensional 
structure, wherein the work area is projected by a viewing device, 

the position of the viewing device relative to the structure is 
determined, the co-ordinates of a displacement path for an 

instrument or for the viewing device in the structure are 
predetermined and compared with the actual position, 

characterised in that, in the projection of the work area, the 
predetermined displacement path is locally accurately 

represented as a piercing point of the displacement path through 
the observed plane of the structure. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that, in each 
plane represented, apart from the piercing points of the 

displacement path, the piercing point or points of the 
displacement path in at least one plane adjacent to the viewing 

plane are additionally represented. 
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that the piercing 
points of different planes are connected by a line in the 

representation. 
A method according to one of claims 2 and 3, characterised in 
that the piercing point or points through the observed plane are 

represented differently from piercing points in other planes.  
 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the work 
area is projected three-dimensionally and viewed stereoscopically 

in a known manner, and in that the displacement path is locally 
accurately superimposed as a three-dimensional representation 

on the three-dimensional projection of the work area. 
A method according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
displacement path is identified by the piercing point in the 

observation plane extending through the focal point of the 
viewing device. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the co-ordinates of the displacement path 

are determined by means of a plurality of cutting-plane 
representations of the structure and piercing points of the 

displacement path established in the said representations. 
A device for representing a work area in a three-dimensional 
structure by means of a viewing device (1) sharply projecting a 

plane of the work area, comprising a measuring device (8, 10) for 
determining the position of the viewing device (1) relative to the 

structure, a comparator for comparing the positional data from 
the viewing device (1) for each plane observed with the co-ordinates 

of a predetermined displacement path in the work area 
observed, a display unit (6) and a data store (12), in which a data 

set for the displacement path relative to the structure is stored, 
wherein the display unit (6) is formed in such a manner that, on the 

basis of this data set, it locally accurately projects the piercing  
 

point (17) of this displacement path in the observed plane of the 
work area.
