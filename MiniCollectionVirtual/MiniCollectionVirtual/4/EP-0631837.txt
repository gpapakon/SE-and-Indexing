<ABSTRACT>
A method of engraving a pattern in a metal roll (4) 
comprises the steps of:

 
   forming a surface on an electrode (2), the surface 

corresponding to a negative image of the pattern to be 
engraved;

 
   supporting the metal roll (4) and the surface of the 

electrode (2) in a dielectric bath (1);
 

   moving the metal roll (4) and the surface of the 
electrode (2) into close proximity; and,

 
   applying a voltage between the electrode (2) and the 

metal roll (4) whilst rotating the metal roll (4) about its 
axis and driving one of the metal roll (4) or electrode (2) 

along at least one other axis to engrave the image on the 
metal roll by electric discharge machining. Preferably the 

electrode (2) is formed by first engraving an image of the 
pattern in a laser engravable material using a CO₂ laser to 

form a master engraving and the electrode (2) is formed 
from this by an electroplating process.

<DESCRIPTION>
At present, simple embossing rolls are manufactured 
using CNC milling machines. More complex patterns may be 
obtained using what is termed the lost wax etch process in 
which a plastics master roll is engraved using a laser. A 
metal roll is coated with a layer of wax and the plastics 
master is rolled around the surface of the metal roll thus 
displacing some of the wax. Concentrated acid is 
subsequently used to etch the surface of the metal roll 
where the wax has been displaced. The metal roll is then 
re-coated with wax and the process is repeated until the 
pattern is etched to the correct depth. The manufacture of steel embossing rolls by direct 
application of a CO₂ laser engraver would be an attractive 
proposition but at present this is not possible since CO₂ 
lasers have insufficient power to enable hardened steel 
rolls to be produced directly by this method. At present, 
only hard polymer rolls can be engraved directly by CO₂ 
laser. Conventionally, a laser is used to expose a 
desired pattern on a photo-resist which is coated onto the 
hardened steel roll and then the photo-resist is developed 
and washed out to expose selected areas of the roll for 
subsequent treatment with concentrated acid. This process, 
like the last wax etch process, suffers from the inherent 
safety and environmental problems associated with 
concentrated acids.  According to a first aspect the present invention, a 
method of engraving a pattern in a metal roll comprises the 
steps of:
 
   forming a surface on an electrode, the surface 
corresponding to a negative image of the pattern to be 
engraved;
 
   supporting the metal roll and the electrode in a 
dielectric bath;
 
   moving the metal roll and the surface of the electrode 
into close proximity; and,
 
   applying a voltage between the electrode and the metal 
roll whilst rotating the metal roll about an axis and 
driving one of the metal roll or electrode along at least 
one other axis without slip occurring between the surface 
of the electrode and the metal roll, to engrave the metal 
roll by electric discharge machining. Preferably the dielectric bath is filled with a liquid 
dielectric such as oil. The electrode may be formed as a cylindrical roll or 
an arc, but preferably it is formed as a flat plate. 
Preferably the flat plate is manufactured from high 
conductivity, oxide-free copper. The electrode plate may be formed by first engraving 
the negative image of the pattern in a curved rubber sheet 
or some other suitable material using a CO₂ laser
