<ABSTRACT>
A spinal implant for use in distracting and 
maintaining spinal disc height while promoting fusion of 

adjacent vertebrae of a spinal column includes first and 
second side surfaces extending substantially parallel to 

each other. Upper and lower surfaces for engaging the 
adjacent vertebrae extend between the first and second side 

surfaces and extend from a first end portion to a second 
end portion of the spinal implant. The spinal implant 

includes recesses located in the first and second side 
surfaces for receiving an instrument to rotate the spinal 

implant. A method of fusing together the adjacent 
vertebrae using the spinal implant includes removing at 

least a portion of the spinal disc between the adjacent 

vertebrae. The spinal implant is inserted between the 
adjacent vertebrae with the first and second parallel side 

surfaces facing the adjacent vertebrae. The spinal implant 
is rotated into a position in which the parallel side 

surfaces extend from one of the adjacent vertebrae to the 
other adjacent vertebrae and the upper and lower surfaces 

engage the adjacent vertebrae.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spinal implant to 
fuse together adjacent vertebrae of a spinal column. A known spinal implant has a rectangular shape and a 
tapered end. The spinal implant includes nubs to grip 
adjacent vertebrae. The nubs have inclined faces that 
accommodate forward sliding movement of the spinal implant 
into channels cut in the adjacent vertebrae. This known 
spinal implant is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,834,757 which is used 
as basis for the preamble of claim 1. By 
cutting channels into the vertebrae for receiving the spinal 
implant, nerve roots are put at risk. A spinal implant, disclosed in earlier EP-A-0 720 455 
document under Art. 54(3) EPC, comprises a rigid rectangular 
wedge shape block having top, bottom, side and end walls. The 
top and bottom walls are imperforate and converge from the 
posterior to the anterior ends of the channels and permit the 
vertebrae receiving the block in the channels to be pulled 
together to restore normal disc contour and sagittal plane 
alignment. The side walls of the block are smooth to prevent 
irritation of the sides of the channels. The side walls have 
a slot providing a chamber to receive bone growth material 
packed around the block. One of the end walls of the block 
has a bore for receiving a tool to facilite insertion of the  
 
block into the channels. The top and bottom walls of the 
block have teeth for biting into the bottoms of the channels. The present invention as defined in claim 1 provides a new and 
improved spinal 
implant to fuse together adjacent vertebrae of a spinal 
column. 
The spinal implant is inserted between the 
adjacent vertebrae with the first and second substantially 
parallel side surfaces facing the adjacent vertebrae. The 
spinal implant is rotated into a position in which the 
parallel side surfaces extend from one of the adjacent 
vertebrae to the other of the adjacent vertebrae and the 
upper and lower surface means engage the adjacent vertebrae. 
There are no channels cut in the adjacent vertebrae. Thus, 
the operation takes less time and lessens the risks to the 
patient. The foregoing and other features of the present 
invention will become more apparent to one skilled in the art 
upon reading the following description of the present  
 
invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
wherein:

having a first embodiment of a spinal implant in accordance 
with the present invention placed therein; Fig. 2 is a perspective view
