<ABSTRACT>
A sheet output module for the collection and stacking of printed media sheets from 
the output of a reproduction apparatus, with multiple separate sheet collection bins (11) in a 

vertical array, a sheet input for receiving the sheets, and a sheet transport path for transporting 
the sheets to a selected bin; the sheet input is at a central vertical level intermediately of the 

module and the vertical bin array, the vertical bin array is divided into first and second portions 
with a central vertical space therebetween, the sheet transport path has a common shared 

central path (12a) from the input to a branching position where it arcuately branches in 
opposite directions, with a first branch path (12b) extending upwardly to feed sheets to the 

first portion of the bins and a second branch path (12c) extending downwardly to feed sheets 
to the second portion of
 the bins. A sheet deflector gate (14) is located at this branching 
position for selectively deflecting sheets from a the common shared path portion into one of 

these first and second branch paths. A high capacity stacking tray (17) is located within this 
vertical space between the first and second portions of the vertical array of bins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet output module for collection, separation and
stacking of printed media sheets.There is disclosed in an embodiment herein an integral output plural mode sheet
sorting and stacking system capable of independently handling and separating different jobs
for different users or addressees automatically and/or alternately stacking large and/or
multiple jobs in a high capacity stacker, in a compact shared unit.More particularly, there is disclosed in this embodiment a compact integrated sheet
output unit with a high capacity sheet stacker and multiple sorter or mailbox bins in an
improved modular configuration with an improved paper path.Disclosed in this embodiment is an improved "mailbox" or sorter system for
automatically discretely handling and segregating received sheets (from a copier, scanner,
facsimile, multi-mode or other such printer outputs) with a desirable mid-level
sheet entrance.The disclosed "mailboxing" or sorter unit embodiment can desirably be a universal
modular or stand-alone unit that may be attached to, or even simply moved next to, the output
of almost any conventional copier or printer, including facsimile machines or networked
electronic mail printers.For mailboxing, fixed bins systems (requiring longer paper paths) are preferable to
moving bins type sorters. Moving bin sorters are not desirable for mailbox systems for bin
unloading operability reasons. They are unlike sorter systems, which hold only plural sets of
one single users job, and stop after set completion. A mailbox system holds many different
users jobs in different bins and can start up at any time, including times while other bins are
being unloaded. If the bins of a mailbox system started to move when someone was unloading
their job, it could be disturbing to the user. Furthermore, since moving bin systems typically
collapse the bins as they move past the sheet input location, that could pinch the users hand.
Also, although moving bins systems can have shorter sheet transport paths, they have difficulty
moving the bin array fast enough to provide rapid random access to any bin rather than just
sequential adjacent bin access. Large multiple fixed bin sorters have other advantages over
moving bin sorters, such as not requiring a high powered elevator motor to rapidly vertically
move the weight of all bins when they are all filled with stacked sheets, and not having
external exposed moving components. However, most fixed bin sorters and mailbox systems
require particularly long paper

<CLAIMS>
A sheet output module for the collection, separation and stacking of printed media
sheets received from the output of a reproduction apparatus, with multiple separate sheet

collection bins (11) in a vertical array, a sheet input for receiving the print media sheets from
the output of the reproduction apparatus, and a sheet transport path (12) for transporting the

sheets from said sheet input to a selected said bin, characterised in that

said sheet input is at a vertical level intermediately of said module and said vertical
bin array;
said vertical bin array is intermediately divided into first and second portions with a
vertical space therebetween;
said sheet transport path (12) has a common shared path portion (12a) from said central
sheet input to a branching position where said sheet transport path branches arcuately in

opposite directions, with a first branch path (12b) extending upwardly to feed sheets to said
first portion of said bins and a second branch path (12c) extending downwardly to feed sheets

to said second portion of said bins;
a sheet deflector gate (14) is mounted at said branching position for selectively
deflecting sheets from said common shared path portion into one of said first and second

branch paths (12a, 12b);
and a high capacity stacking tray (17) is located within said vertical space between
said first and second portions of said vertical array of bins (11) also connecting with said sheet

transport path to receive said print media sheets.
A sheet output module as claimed in claim 1, wherein said sheet transport path (12) is in
the general shape of a rotated "T".
A sheet output module as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said first and second
branch paths (12a, 12b) extend past said respective first and second portions of said vertical array of bins (11).
A sheet output module as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said first and
second portions of said bins (11) comprise approximately equal halves of said vertical array of bins.
A sheet output module as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said sheet
deflector gate (14) is activated by movement of a movable compiler/finishing unit between said first

and second portions of said vertical bin array. 
A sheet output module as claimed in claim 5, wherein said compiler/finishing unit is
between said first and second branch paths (12a, 12b) and said bin array, and feeds said printed media

sheets from a selected first or second branch path to a selected said bin.
A sheet output module as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said sheet
transport path (12) further includes a bypass extension path system (22) to feed sheets on to said central

sheet input of a second said sheet output module, said bypass extension path being at a vertical
level intermediately of said module and said vertical bin array and communicating with said

common shared path portion from said central sheet input to said branching position and then
extending on from between said first and second branch paths (12a, 12b).
A sheet output module as claimed in claim 7, wherein said bypass extension path
system (22) extends out through said sheet collection bins (11) centrally between said sheet collection

bins.
A sheet output module of claim 7, wherein said bypass extension path system (22) is a
removable module that fits into a space provided by removing two of said sheet collection bins (11).
