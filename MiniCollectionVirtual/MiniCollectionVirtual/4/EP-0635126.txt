<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally in the field of
microbiology and more specifically concerns microbiological
assays. In particular, the present invention provides a
computerised image analysis method for detecting
microorganisms in a biological sample. Furthermore, the
present invention provides a computerised image analysis
method for assaying the sensitivity of microorganisms to
antibiotic drugs.Also provided by the present invention is a system
for carrying out the method of the invention.The prior art considered to be relevant as a
background to the present invention is listed in the end of
the description before the claims. These prior art
references will be acknowledged by indicating in brackets
their number in this list.Microbiological tests have a wide range of
applicability such as in medicine, in monitoring water
quality, in assuring food safety etc. In clinical practice
microbiological assays are of particular importance and have
a major role in the diagnosis of infections and/or
determination of a proper drug treatment in case of 
infection. In such assays the presence of pathological
microorganisms in clinical samples, their number, their
identity as well as their sensitivity to antibiotic drugs
are determined.The most widely used microbiological assays
involve incubating a biological sample on various growth
media and determining the growth of microorganisms thereon
(1). In order to determine sensitivity of the microorganisms
to drug growth of the microorganisms is determined in the
presence of the drug (2). Among the biggest drawbacks of
such assays is the fact that they require a considerable
time, usually 24 to 48 hours, and thus do not enable a rapid
diagnosis which is required in cases where immediate
treatment is necessary. Thus very often physicians are
compelled to begin treatment without waiting for the
clinical results which thus have only a confirmatory value.
Consequently the treatment is not always appropriate and is
also given at times to non-infected patients.Additionally, such assays are labour consuming and
require a considerable amount of laboratory space and this
considerably limits the widespread use of such assays in
screening of susceptible populations for the occurrence of
infections. For example, urinary tract infections are not
always accompanied by clinical symptoms (5) and elderly
people in which asymptomatic infections may be dangerous
(5,6,7), may not be routinely tested.It may thus be readily understood that methods
which do not involve prolonged incubation

<CLAIMS>
A computerized image analysis method for detecting
microorganisms in a sample comprising placing a specimen

from the sample in a microscope, recording the image viewed
through the microscope by appropriate image recording

means, analyzing the image to identify particulate objects
therein and classifying these objects as microorganisms or

non-microorganismal objects, which classifying comprises
determining the optical slope being the change in

brightness across the edge of the object.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the
classification comprises establishing whether said optical

slope falls within a certain range, an object which is
classified as a microorganism having said optical slope

within said range.
A method according to Claim 2, wherein said
classifying further comprises determining the moment, being

a product of the light intensity of each point in the
object and its distance from the object's center.
A method according to Claim 3, wherein the
classification comprises establishing whether said moment

falls within a certain range, an object which is classified
as a microorganism having said brightness variance within

said range.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
wherein the classification of an object as a microorganism

comprises also the determination of the object's length,
width, area and its overall shape.
A method according to Claim 5, wherein the
characterization of the object as a microorganism is based

on its position in a multidimensional parameter field, the
parameters comprising said optical slope, said moment,

length, width and overall shape. 
A method according to Claim 6, wherein the object's
position in said multidimensional parameter field is used

to further characterize the type of the microorganism.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
comprising determining the concentration of microorganisms

in a sample.
A method for determining the sensitivity of
microorganisms to an antibiotic drug which comprises:


(a) preparing a test mixture comprising the
microorganisms and the antibiotic drugs and a control

mixture comprising the microorganisms, but without the
antibiotic drug, incubating both mixtures under the same

conditions for the same amount of time;
(b) detecting microorganisms in said test mixture and
in said control mixture by the method according to any one

of Claims 1 to 7 and measuring at least one other
morphological parameter of the detected microorganisms;
(c) comparing microorganismal count in said test
mixture and in said control mixture and determining

sensitivity of the microorganisms to the antibiotic drug
based on the difference in this parameter in said test

mixture as compared to said control mixture.
A method for determining the sensitivity of
microorganisms to an antibiotic drug which comprises:


(a) preparing a test mixture comprising the
microorganisms and the antibiotic drugs and a control

mixture comprising the microorganisms but without the
antibiotic drug, incubating both mixtures under the same

conditions for the same amount of time;
(b) detecting microorganisms in said test mixture and
in said control mixture by the method according to any one

of Claims 1 to 7 and determining the count of detected
microorganisms in each of the mixtures;
(c) comparing microorganismal count in said test
mixture and in said control mixture and determining

sensitivity of the microorganisms to the antibiotic drug
based on the difference in this parameter in said test

mixture as compared to said control mixture.
A method according to Claim 10 wherein the
determination of sensitivity to antibiotics also comprises

determining at least one other morphological parameter of
the microorganism and comparing the change in said

morphological parameter as between the two mixtures.
A method according to Claim 9 or 11, wherein said at
least one other morphological parameter is selected from

the group consisting of the object's length, width, area,
overall shape and moment.
An image analysis system for detecting microorganisms

an image viewed through the microscope, means for
digitizing the recorded image, and image processing means;

the system being characterized in that said image
processing means are adapted to classify an object as being

either a microorganism or a non-microorganismal object by
means of determining the optical slope of the object, the

optical slope being the change in brightness across the
edge of the object, an optical slope within a certain

predetermined range signifying that the object is a
microorganism.
A system according to Claim 13, wherein said image
processing means are further adapted to determine the

moment of the object, the moment being a product of the
light intensity of each point in the object and the

distance from the object's center, a moment within a
predetermined range signifying that the object is a

microorganism.
A system according to Claim 13 or 14, wherein said
image processing means are further adapted to classify an

object as a microorganism on the basis of an object's
