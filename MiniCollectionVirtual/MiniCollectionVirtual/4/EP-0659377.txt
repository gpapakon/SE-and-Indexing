<ABSTRACT>
A movable body (10) comprising a decoction chamber (11) is 
provided to move in the direction of the axis of the chamber (11); 

the body (10) is moved with outward and return travel alternately; 
a first plunger (3) is provided slidable within the chamber (11) 

and having its plug (31) retained by stop means (25) such as not 
to leave the chamber (11), said plug (31) being axially movable 

relative to the fixed structure (20); a fixed second plunger (4) 
is also provided slidable within the chamber (11) and opposing the 

first plunger (3), its plug (41) being able to enter and leave the 
chamber (11); the plungers (3) and (4) have internal ducts for 

communication between the active faces of the respective plugs 
(31, 41) and the steam/hot water source and, respectively, the 

drink delivery outlet (7); the return travel of the movable body 
(10) causes the plunger (4) to withdraw from the chamber (11) and 

the plunger (3) to slide within the chamber (11) along its entire 
length; the outward travel of the body (10) causes the plunger (3) 

to be dragged and the plunger (4) to penetrate into the chamber 
(11) with mutual approach of the two plugs (31) and (41).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic machine for making 
espresso coffee or similar drinks, in which the drink is 
obtained by introducing the ground coffee or other ground 
product into a decoction chamber, compressing this ground 
product and then passing pressurized steam/hot water 
through it. Typically the machine of the invention is intended as an 
automatic distributor for such drinks, in particular 
coffee. The EP-A-299399 discloses an automatic machine for making 
espresso coffee according 
to the preamble of claim 1, having a body with a cylindrical decoction 
chamber in its interior and able to move in the direction 
of the axis of this chamber. With the chamber there are 
associated two plungers, the first of which is constrained 
to the chamber such that its plug cannot leave the chamber 
but remains resting against a stop wall at a first end of 
the chamber; the second plunger is fixed to a fixed 
structure and enters and leaves the chamber via its second 
end. The body is moved with outward and return travel 
alternately. The steam/hot water is fed in the decoction chamber through 
an axial channel in the first plunger rod, and to the 
latter through a flexible tube connecting the said rod to a 
fixed steam/hot water source. During its outward travel, the movable body drags the first 
plunger towards the second plunger, both within said 
chamber, so as to compact the product in the chamber to the 
required extent and hence effect decoction of the product 
to obtain the drink, by means of steam/hot water passing  
 
through said compacted product. During the return travel 
the second plunger withdraws from the chamber until it lies 
at a distance from the movable body. Simultaneously the 
first plunger is moved until it abuts against a suitable 
stop element so that it stops and, by sliding within the 
chamber, expels the spent product. The connection between the said rod and said source 
presents some drawbacks which limit the machine efficiency 
and reliability, due to the flexible tube being repeatedly 
subject to deformation under high temperature conditions, 
that shorten hardly its life. The scope of the present invention is to improve the means 
for feeding the steam/hot water to the decoction chamber 
and for compressing the ground product in the decoction 
chamber, by providing constructionally simple means of 
reliable and fast operation. The scope is achieved by a machine for making espresso 
having the characteristics recited in the claims.  
 The invention is described in

<CLAIMS>
Automatic machine for making espresso coffee or 
similar drinks, in which the drink is obtained by 

introducing the ground coffee or other product into a 
decoction chamber (11), then compacting this ground product 

and passing pressurized steam/hot water through it, 
comprising: 


a movable body (10) having a cylindrical decoction chamber (11) 
with a first end (11') and a second open end (11''), 

said chamber being in communication with means (8) for 
supplying the ground product, and said movable body (10) 

being constrained to a fixed structure (20) in a manner 

able to move in the direction of the axis of the 
chamber (11); 
a first plunger (3) axially slidable under sealed 
conditions within the chamber (11) and having its plug (31) 

retained by stop means (14) positioned at said first 
end (11') so that it cannot leave through said first end (11'), 

said plug (31) being axially movable 
relative to the fixed structure (20); 
a second plunger (4) axially slidable under sealed 
conditions within the chamber (11) and opposing the 

first plunger (3), its plug (41) being able to pass 
through the second end (11'') of the chamber (11); 

said second plunger being substantially constrained axially 
 
said plungers (3) and (4) having internal ducts for 

communication between the active faces of the 
respective plugs (31,41) and, respectively, the 

steam/hot water source and the drink delivery outlet;
  
 

and means (24,26) for moving the movable body (10) in said axial direction with outward 
and return travel alternately, the return travel of the movable body (10) causing the second 

plunger (4) to withdraw from the decoction chamber (11) and the first plunger (3) to halt 
against an abutment element (25') and then slide within the chamber (11) along its entire 

length, the outward travel of the movable body (10) causing the first plunger (3) to be 
dragged and the second plunger (4) to penetrate into the chamber (11) with mutual 

approach of the two plugs (31,41),
  
 

characterised in that the first plunger (3) has a 
telescopic rod consisting of a first rod portion (34), 

rigid with the plug (31), and a second rod portion (33) 
fixed to the structure (20), an axial channel (37) of 

the first rod portion communicating with the active 
face of the plug (31), the second rod portion (33)  

 
which slides under sealed conditions in said axial 

channel (37) having a thinner axial channel (36) 
terminating at its rear end in communication with the 

steam/hot water source. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that the first rod portion (34) is urged by spring 

means (35) rearwards relative to the movable body (10) 
in such a manner as to maintain the plug (31) normally 

at the first end (11'') of the chamber (11), the free 
end of said portion (34) abutting against a part of the 

fixed structure (20) to halt the first plunger (3) 
during its return travel. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the plugs (31,41) comprise circular filtering 

plates (39,49) retained by respective peripheral rings 
(51) welded to the respective plug.
