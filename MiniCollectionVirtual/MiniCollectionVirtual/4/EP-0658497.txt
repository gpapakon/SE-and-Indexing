<ABSTRACT>
In a vacuum device for the suspended transport of plates over a preadjustable transport stage, plates and such like articles also consisting of non-magnetisable materials are to be transported. This is possible in that transport bands (12) of finite length which span the transport stage are arranged next to and parallel to one another transversely to the transport stage and can be driven by a common drive and movement means (13, 14, 16, 17), the movement drive (motor 13) of which is reversible for a to-and-fro movement of the transport bands (12) and which, in the region grasping the plates (26, 27), each have a frame-guided slide-like rigid part (21) having a sucker means (22) or are connected to such a part.

<CLAIMS>
Vacuum-operated apparatus for the suspended
transport of metal sheets, sheet bars and sheet-like

articles of this type over a presettable transport zone,
characterized in that transport bands (12) mounted on

transport or deflecting rollers (16, 17) and spanning the
transport zone are arranged next to and parallel to one

another transversely relative to the transport zone and
can be driven via common drive and movement means (13,

14, 16, 17), the movement drive (motor 13) of which is
reversible for a to-and-fro movement of the transport

bands (12) and which in each case, in the region gripping
the metal sheets (26, 27), have or are connected to a

frame-guided slide-like rigid part (21) having a sucker
means (22), the distance between the transport bands (12)

being individually or altogether jointly adjustable to
the metal sheet size.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the transport bands (12) are toothed belts.
