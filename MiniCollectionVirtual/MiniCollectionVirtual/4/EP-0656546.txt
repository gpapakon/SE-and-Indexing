<ABSTRACT>
A proximity detector comprises a series of transmitters for 
generating pulses (16) of infra red radiation within a zone of 

radiation and a series of receivers (10) for sensing pulses 
(18a,18b,18c,18d) of radiation reflected from objects within a 

zone of reception intersecting with the zone of radiation and 
for generating signals (20a,20b,20c,20d) indicative of the 

intensity of the reflected pulses (18a,18b,18c,18d), the 
transmitted pulses (16) being shaped such that a side thereof is 

an exponential curve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a proximity detector for use with a 
motor vehicle. In GB-A 2 214 290 there is disclosed a proximity detector for 
detecting objects behind a reversing vehicle the detector 
including a transmitter for transmitting infra red radiation and 
a receiver sensitive to the radiation such that objects are 
detected if located within a zone of the radiation to which the 
receiver is sensitive. However, a disadvantage of the detector 
is that the zone is of small area and, consequently, the 
detector only detects objects which are located within that 
small area. In EP-A 0 505 028 A there is disclosed a proximity detector in 
which the disadvantage is overcome by providing a series of 
transmitter units each having a plurality of transmitters 
adapted to transmit pulses of infra red radiation and a series 
of reception units each having a plurality of receivers each 
sensitive to a zone of radiation emitted by the corresponding 
transmitters. The detector includes an audio unit adapted to 
emit an audio signal the amplitude of which varies in accordance 
with the intensity of radiation received at the reception units. However, since larger objects reflect more radiation than 
smaller objects, a disadvantage of the detector disclosed in 
EP-A 0 505 028 is that the amplitude of the audio signal emitted  
 
in respect of an object located within the zone of detection is 
not indicative of the distance of the object from the detector. 
Instead, for two objects located at the same distance from the 
detector there may exist an error between the amplitude of a 
signal generated in response to radiation reflected from a large 
object and the amplitude of a signal generated in response to 
radiation reflected from a small object. The invention is characterised in that the pulses are shaped 
such that the intensity of transmitted radiation varies 
exponentially with respect to time from a first intensity to a 
second intensity and wherein means are provided for generating 
signals indicative of the maximum width of the radiation pulses 
sensed by the receivers. By shaping the transmitted pulses in this way the error between 
amplitudes generated in respect of objects of differing sizes 
located at the same distance from the transmitter and receiver 
units is significantly reduced. Following is a description, by way of example only and with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of 
carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings:-
