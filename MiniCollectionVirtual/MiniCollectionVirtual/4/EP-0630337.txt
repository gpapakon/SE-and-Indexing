<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for packaging of bulk goods into a unit-load package and a unit-load package for bulk goods. The unit-load package consists of an inner package (11) and of an outer package (16). The inner package (11) is an inner sack made of a flexible material and provided with a reinforcement structure, which sack has been placed on a base (13) for the time of filing with bulk goods, whereby, during the filing, the inner package (11) is shaped substantially as parallelepiped. The outer package (16) is an outer package which is made of a plastic material and which surrounds the inner package (11) tightly and gives it adequate stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for packaging of bulk goods into a unit-load 
package. The invention also concerns a unit-load package for bulk goods, which package 
consists of an inner package and an outer package. For packaging, storage, and transportation of bulk goods, box packages or other 
packages of rigid construction are used, which are placed on a base (usually a 
pallet). The box packages consist of boxes of corrugated board. The box of 
corrugated board is, as a rule, provided with an inner sack. When filled, such a 
package has a quadrangular shape and, thus, utilizes the transportation base 
maximally, even though the package as such is expensive. Unit-load sacks are also used for packaging, storage, and transportation of bulk 
goods. A unit-load sack is less expensive than a box package, but its drawback is 
its round shape when filled, whereby it utilizes the transportation base less 
efficiently than a box package does.  
 EP-A-0 122 864 shows a method and an apparatus according to 
the preamble of the claim 1 or 15, respectively.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide a method for packaging of bulk 
goods into a resilient package and a resilient package for bulk goods which, 
when filled, obtains a substantially quadrangular shape and in which, as the base, 
it is possible to use standard pallets (e.g. EUR, FIN pallets). In this way, it is 
possible to combine the maximal utilization of space by a box package with the 
favourable cost of a resilient package. At the same time, the recycling of the 
used package can be arranged better, because no sorting is required, but the 
resilient package is recycled as such, and the standard pallet is returned to  
 
circulation. In the case of a box package, it is necessary to separate the box, the 
inner sack, and the base, and the recycling must be arranged through three 
separate systems. A further object of the invention is to provide a method for packaging of such 
bulk goods into a resilient package whose inner friction is very low.  
 The present invention provides a method for packaging bulk 
goods according to claim 1 and a unit-load package for bulk 
goods according to claim 15.  
 In the method of the invention, it has been realized to use a unit-load package 
which consists of an inner package made of a flexible inexpensive material and 
of a surrounding outer package, which gives the unit-load package adequate  
 
robustness. As the flexible material of the inner package, whose rigidity is 
relatively low, for example,
