<ABSTRACT>
In a manually operated self-closing shut-off valve, a return device for the damped automatic return of the switching member from its open position into its closed position, a fluidtight housing (28) in which the switching shaft (22) of the shut-off valve engages, a piston device (36) with at least one piston mounted in displaceable fashion in the housing, a gear mechanism (38, 40) for converting the rotary motion of the switching shaft into a linear motion of the piston, a first space (44), which is arranged between the piston and the housing, in front of the piston in the direction of motion of the piston, a second space (46) arranged behind the piston (36), a spring arrangement (42), which is arranged in the space (44) and can be subjected to a load when the switching member is opened manually, a fluid medium within the housing (28) and a flow-restriction device (50, 52, 54) for the restricted supply of the medium to the space (44), which increases in size during the automatic return, and for the restricted release of the medium from the space (46), which decreases in size during the automatic return. By virtue of the damped closure of the shut-off valve, the risk of injury is avoided and stresses on the material are reduced.

Manually-operated self-closing shut-off valve 
(10), such as a ball valve, tap cock, butterfly valve and 

the like, having a control shaft (22) which is connected 
fixedly in terms of rotation to the control element of 

the shut-off valve, a lever (24) which is connected 
fixedly in terms of rotation to the control shaft, and a 

restoring arrangement (20), arranged fixedly in terms of 
location with respect to the valve housing (16) and 

interacting with the control shaft, for the damped, 
automatic return of the control element from its open 

position into its closed position, the restoring arrangement 
having a fluid-tight housing (28), into which the 

control shaft (22) engages, characterized in that the 
restoring arrangement furthermore exhibits the following 

features: 

a piston device (36; 37, 37') with at least one 
piston mounted displaceably in the housing (28), 
a transmission device (38, 40; 39, 39', 40) for 
transferring the rotary motion of the control shaft 

(22) into a linear motion of the at least one piston 
(36; 37, 37'), 
at least one first chamber (44; 45, 45') which, seen 
in the direction of movement of the at least one 

piston, is arranged in front of the piston between 
the piston and the housing, 
a second chamber (46) arranged behind the at least 
one piston (36; 37, 37'), 
a spring device (42, 43, 43') which is arranged in 
at least one (44; 45, 45') of the chambers and can  

 
be compressed when the control element is opened 

manually, 
a fluid medium inside the housing (28), and 
a restrictor device (48; 50, 52, 54) for restricting 
the supply of the medium into the chamber (44; 54, 

54') increasing in size during the automatic return 
or for restricting the discharge of the medium from 

the chamber (46) decreasing in size during the 
automatic return. 
Shut-off valve according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the restoring arrangement (20) is designed 

in the manner of a simply operating pneumatic part-turn 
valve actuator with spring return. 
Shut-off valve according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fluid medium is a liquid, in particular 

hydraulic oil. 
Shut-off valve according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fluid medium is a gas, in particular 

air. 
Shut-off valve according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the restrictor device is 

formed by a through-opening (48 or 49, 49') provided in 
the at least one piston (36 or 37, 37'), which through-opening 

connects the at least one first chamber (44 or 
45, 45') to the second chamber (46). 
Shut-off valve according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that an optionally adjustable throttle non-return 

valve is arranged in the through-opening (48; 49, 49'). 
Shut-off valve according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that at least one throttle valve or throttle non-return 

valve is provided in the housing (28), which valve 
connects at least one of the chambers (44 or 45, 45'; 46) 

to the external atmosphere. 
Shut-off valve according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the spring device (42; 43, 

43') is formed by at least one coil spring. 
Shut-off valve according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that a plurality of coil springs (42, 43, 43') 

are provided.
