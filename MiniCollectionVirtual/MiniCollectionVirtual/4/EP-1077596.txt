<ABSTRACT>
The anvil (22) of a set of secateurs of this type can be displaced in relation to its supporting (14) limb (on a bearing bush) by means of the swivel axis so that the secateurs can be set without light gaps. The setting is fixed by means of at least one standard screw which is guided through the bearing bush (34) and which presses the contact surfaces of the secateur limbs (12, 14) and the anvil (22) together with a friction fit on the anvil setting, which is set by closing the secateurs. A positive fit is obtained with a solid square bolt (44) which is arranged in a hole of the secateur limb in such a way that it cannot twist around and which supports an annular blade (48) on a front annular surface facing towards the anvil (22). Said annular blade becomes embedded in the anvil as the shaft of the second screw is screwed in, hereby forming a positive fit. The cutting edge extends across the outer middle section of the front annular surface. The screw shaft is guided through an arched slit (40) in the anvil (22), said slit extending concentrically in relation to the swivel axis about which the anvil (22) can pivot within a limited angle of approximately 2 DEG .

<CLAIMS>
Garden pruner having a blade (20) carried by a first 
pruner leg (14) and having a second pruner leg (12) 

connected to said blade via a bearing screw (10), said 
second pruner leg (12) bearing an anvil (22) which, in 

order to obtain a chink-free adjustment between the 
cutting edge (24) of the blade (20) and the anvil surface, 

is being adapted to be pivoted relative to the second 
pruner leg (12) and to be clamped to the second pruner leg 

(12) by two screws (26, 36),
characterised by
 the following features: 

a first screw (26) is arranged in a bearing 
(34), the axis of which forms the pivot axis 

(32) of the anvil (22); 
a second screw (36) is screwed into a nut (44) 
and guided in an arcuate slot (40) running 

concentrically to the pivot axis (32); 
the anvil (22) is adapted to be clamped between 
the nut (44) and the head (46) of the second 

screw (36); 
the front annular face of the nut (44) and/or 
the front annular face, nearest the anvil (22), 

of the head (46) of the second screw (36) is 
configured in the form of an annular cutter 

(48) which, as the screwed connection (36, 44) 
is being tightened, digs into the contiguous 

surface of the anvil (22) and produces a form 
fit. 
Garden pruner according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the nut (44) is inserted in a non-rotatable 
manner into a hole (42) in the second pruner leg  

 
(12) and the shank (38) of the second screw (36) projects 

through the arcuate slot (40) of the anvil (22). 
Garden pruner according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the annular cutter (48) is arranged 
in the outer central portion of the front annular surface 

of the nut (44) and/or screw head (46). 
Garden pruner according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 the annular cutter (48) extends 
symmetrically to both sides from its crown and the cutting 

angle is approximately 60Â°. 
Garden pruner according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the first screw (26) is screwed into 
a threaded hole (30) in the pruner leg (12) which is made 

out of hardened steel plate, and is adapted to be 
tightened by its head against the anvil (22). 
Garden pruner according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the bearing of the first screw (26) 
consists of a bearing bushing (34) which is inserted into 

an annular turned recess in the anvil (22) and the second 
pruner leg (12). 
Garden pruner according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the annular cutter (48) is a smooth 
construction. 
Garden pruner according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the annular cutter (48) is a toothed 
construction.
