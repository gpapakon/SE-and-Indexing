<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement 
as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Traditionally, an elevator machinery is attached 
to the building by using a base located mainly 
under the elevator machinery; in other words, the machinery 
as if stands on its base. This means that the centre 
of gravity and the point of application of the rope forces 
are located above the supporting points of the elevator 
machinery. A drawback with such a design is that the 
machinery is prone to various rocking vibrations. To 
overcome these, the points by which the base is supported 
on the building structures have to be placed as 
far apart as possible, which again requires floor space 
and increases the costs. To prevent rocking, a conventional 
base has to be fairly rigid in construction. Such a 
base structure normally has four supporting points, one 
at each corner. FR-A-1 338 648 provides an arrangement with 
two parallel mounting beams which are attached at one 
end to the wall of the elevator shaft and at the other end 
to a ceiling or wall in a machine room beside the elevator 
shaft. This known arrangement is very space consuming 
as a separate machine room is needed beside the 
elevator shaft and on the other hand this structure is 
somewhat complicated as two parallel beams are necessary 
to carry a very big sized motor drive and the corresponding 
rope guiding elements. EP-A- 371 806 discloses an elevator comprising 
a mounting beam for the diverting pulleys of the 
hoisting ropes which beam is fixed by its ends solely to 
the walls or ceiling of the elevator shaft. The drive unit 
of this construction is placed at the bottom of the elevator 
shaft. The DE AS 1,033,383 shows a beam suspension for an elevator machinery 
comprising a beam which extends horizontally in the 
center of the elevator shaft above the elevator cabin. The construction 
comprises an elevator motor which is suspended at the 
beam's lower edge, a gear wheel which is driven by the output 
shaft of the elevator motor and a traction sheave located laterally 
of the beam, the gear wheel being fixedly connected 
against rotation with the traction sheave via a shaft so as to 
transmit the rotational moments from the output shaft of the 
motor to the traction sheave. The construction further comprises 
a guide beam for leading the elevator ropes from the 
traction sheave to a remote pulley, the guide beam being fixedly 
connected with the complete supporting beam structure. 
This construction is on one hand very complicated and on
