<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for 
joining the frame of a landing door (7) 

of an elevator to the wall structure (4) 
surrounding the frame, in such a way that 

the elevator shaft (5) is isolated from 
the rest of the space in the building. 

According to the invention, a heat-resistant 
protective element (9) flexible 

in normal temperature and at least in a 
temperature of 500° is fitted between the 

frame (8) and the wall structure (4), 
said element being attached to the door 

frame (8) and to the shaft wall structure 
(4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system as defined in the
preamble of claim 1 for joining the frame of a landing door
of an elevator to the surrounding wall structure.When an elevator is to be installed in a building, the delivery
limit for the elevator supplier on each floor is generally
the door opening provided for a door in the landing
wall. As the case may be, the door opening is somewhat
larger than the space required by the frame of the landing
door. The gap remaining between the frame and the wall
structure has to be covered not only because of esthetic and
safety considerations but also to comply with the fire safety
regulations of many countries. The door and the structure
joining it to the door opening must withstand e.g. a heat of
1000 °C for two hours. On the other hand, the operating environment
may require structures as light and inconspicuous
as possible. E.g. in an elevator shaft with glass walls, the
aim is to maximize the transparent wall area.In elevator technology, there are previously known solutions
in which a vertical steel plate is attached to the vertical
part of the frame of the landing door of the elevator, on
the side facing the shaft. The plate is also attached to the
wall structure. Alternatively, the other edge of the plate
is not attached to the wall but the gap between the plate
and the wall is sealed with insulating material. In another
previously known solution, the gap between the frame and the
wall is simply filled with insulating material in cases
where tight mounting tolerances have been achieved.The problem in previously known technology is that the manufacturing
tolerances may vary considerably, which means that
plates of several widths must be available. In cases of
fire, the structures undergo deformations causing changes in
the gap between the frame and the door opening. Especially
if materials deformable in fire situations are used, a gap
providing passage for flames between the shaft and the 
landing will be formed, particularly when the insulating
material is completely loosened. In scenic elevators, the
supporting structures and therefore also the supports surrounding
the door opening as well as the frame placed in the
opening are made as light and small as possible. Solving the
problems with previously known technics requires extra work
and materials, increasing the costs. FR-2 610 211 shows a protective device comprising a flexible
protection element made of caoutchuc which is located in the
region between the frame of a landing door and an elevator

<CLAIMS>
System for joining the frame (8) of a landing door (7) of
an elevator to the wall structure (4) surrounding the frame in

such a way that the elevator shaft (5) is isolated from the
rest of the space in the building at least by means of a heat

resistant and flexible protective element (9) extending between
an upright part of the frame (8) and the wall structure

(4), which protective element (9) is flexible in normal temperature
and in the temperature prevailing in a fire situation,

characterized in

that a jamb structure (10) is provided in the region between
frame and wall structure,
that the protective element (9) is flexible such that the part
of the element which exceeds the width of the gap between frame

and wall structure can be bent or rolled up in the space remaining

inside the jamb structure, and
that the protective element (9) is fixedly attached both to the
door frame (8) as well as the wall structure (4) so that the

insulation formed by the protective element between the shaft
and the landing is preserved in circumstances of changing temperature.
System according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that a
protective element is also fitted between the yoke of the

door frame and the shaft wall edge essentially parallel to
it.
System according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that
the protective element (9) consists of a laminated structure

coated with fireproof material at least on one (15) of its
surfaces.
System according to claim 1 - 3, 
characterized
 in that
the edges of the protective element (9) are provided with

reinforcements (16,17,18) by which the element can be
fastened to the door frame (8) and to the shaft wall

structure (4), respectively.
System according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that
the protective element (9) is composed of a layer structure

consisting of a steel wire net (38) and a fireproof fabric
(39) and attached to the door frame (34) and the wall

structure (31). 
System according to claim 1 - 5, 
characterized
 in that a
jamb structure (10;35,36) is attached to the door frame

(8;34) and to the wall structure (4;31) by fixing elements
having a low resistance to strain in order to cover the

protective element (9) on the landing site. 
System for joining two wall structures (4) to each other

which protective element is mounted between an upright part of

the wall structures (4),

wherein a jamb structure (10) is provided for covering the protective
element (9), 
wherein the protective element (9) is flexible such that the
part of the element which exceeds the width of the gap between

the wall structures (4) can be bent or rolled up in the space
