<ABSTRACT>
The tubular support for mounting an elastic shrinkable sleeve comprises a rigid tube covered on the outside with a film having a low coefficient of friction. It is characterised in that it furthermore comprises a means (3) for guiding and for driving the said film (2) mounted totally freely with respect to the said tube (1), guiding and driving the film around a front end (1a) and against the internal surface of the said tube (1).   Application: mounting an elastic sleeve on a cylindrical element.

A tubular support for installing a shrinkable elastic sleeve (5), 
the support receiving the expanded sleeve (5) for the purpose of 

installing it on a rigid cylindrical element (7) threaded through 
said support, the support comprising a rigid tube (1) and a film (2) 

having a low coefficient of friction covering the outside surface of 
the rigid tube (1) over at least a fraction of the length of the 

rigid tube (1) and running substantially from a "front" end (1A) 
thereof, which end corresponds to a front margin of said film (2), 

the support being characterized in that said film (2) is mounted so 
as to be completely free relative to said rigid tube (1), and in that 

the tubular support includes guide and drive means (3, 13, 14) for 
said film (2) for guiding and driving said film from the outside 

surface of said rigid tube, around the front end (1A), and along the 
inside surface of said rigid tube (1). 
A support according to claim 1, characterized in that at least 
said front end (1A) of said rigid tube (1) is rounded. 
A support according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said 
guide and drive means is constituted by a set of belts (3) preferably 

having a low coefficient of friction, the belts being mounted on the 
film (2) and the rigid tube (1), and forming closed loops passing via 

the inside of the tube and against the inside surface thereof. 
A support according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said 
guide and drive means is constituted by a set of belts (13) 

preferably having a low coefficient of friction, secured to the front 
margin and to the rear opposite margin of said film (2) and 

connecting said margins together via the inside of the rigid tube. 
A support according to claim 4, characterized in that said belts 
(13) are cut out from an initial film (12), extending from the front 

margin of said film (2) and being secured to the rear margin of said 
film (2).  

 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that said rigid tube (1) has a set of holes (43) for the set of belts 

and situated close to the "rear" other end (1B) of the tube, each 
hole serving to pass a respective one of said belts. 
A support according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that drive 
and guide means (14) is constituted by an auxiliary tube slidably 

mounted in said rigid tube (1) and significantly longer than said 
rigid tube, projecting from the "rear" other end (1B) of said rigid 

tube, and secured to the front margin of said film (2). 
A support according to any one of claims 3 to 7, characterized in 
that said rigid tube (1) includes rear means for enabling it to be 

grasped and actuated in the hand (4, 40, 44), and that are provided 
on the end portions of the rigid tube that are not covered by said 

film, which end portions define a "rear" other end of said rigid 
tube. 
A support according to claim 8, characterized in that said rear 
means (44) comprise a set of openings. 
A support according to claim 8, characterized in that said rear 
means (4, 40) comprise a peripheral shoulder. 
A support according to claim 8, and in which said guide and drive 
means for said film comprises a set of belts, characterized in that 

said shoulder (40) is segmented into sectors allowing said belts (3) 
to pass freely between them. 
A support according to claim 8 and in which said guide and drive 
means for said film comprises a set of belts, characterized in that 

said shoulder (4) is pierced by channels (41) for passing said belts 
(3). 
A support according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that said rigid tube (1) has an outside surface state that is  

 
granular, thereby imparting a lower coefficient of friction thereto 

relative to said film.
