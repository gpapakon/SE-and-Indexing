<ABSTRACT>
A memory cell (10) containing a ferroelectric capacitor 
(20) the memory state of which is sensed by cycling the 

potential across the capacitor from zero, through an upper 
electric field point (C) and back to zero. If the cell was 

residing in the upper permanent remnant polarization point 
(D), a low change in charge flow occurs and if the cell was 

residing in the lower permanent remnant polarization point 
(A), a low (near zero) change in charge flow occurs. This 

change in charge flow from a near zero value to a large 
amount allows a very accurate reference capacitor (39) to be 

used for the comparison or sensing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to ferroelectric memory 
cells and more specifically to an improved method of sensing 
the polarization state of ferroelectric memory cells. A basic ferroelectric non-volatile memory cell 
includes, as the major memory component, a capacitor with a 
dielectric which is ferroelectric material. By definition, 
the ferroelectric material has a permanent polarization, 
i.e., a non-zero internal polarization with no applied 
electric field. Hereinafter the term zero electric field 
includes no applied electric field, a zero applied electric 
field, or any other situation in which the resulting 
external electric field on the ferroelectric material is 
zero. In some prior art ferroelectric memory cells pairs of 
ferroelectric capacitors and pairs of switching transistors 
are utilized. In these devices the pairs of capacitors are 
normally in complimentary polarization states and, thus, the 
states are determined by comparing the state of one of the 
capacitors of the pair of capacitors to the state of the 
other capacitor. This memory cell has the disadvantage of 
requiring a substantially larger number of components, which 
increases the size and cost of the structure. A major problem in sensing the polarization state of 
the ferroelectric capacitor in a single capacitor memory 
cell is the fact that the electric field/polarization 
characteristic loop (hysterisis curve) of a ferroelectric  
 
capacitor changes over time, due to ageing from use or due 
to ageing from being left in a polarization state for an 
extended time. Generally, this change in polarization 
properties with time, results in a collapsing of the 
hysterisis curve. This is a basic materials phenomenon 
which is due to a non-reversibility in at least a portion of 
the volume of the ferroelectric material under electric 
field/polarization cycling. This changing of the 
ferroelectric material makes it very difficult to use a 
conventional reference cell strategy to determine the 
polarization state of ferroelectric memory cells. It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a 
new and improved method of sensing the polarization state of 
the ferroelectric capacitor in a memory cell. It is a further purpose of the present invention to 
provide a new and improved method of sensing the 
polarization state of the ferroelectric capacitor in a 
memory cell, which maintains its accuracy over time 
dependent changes. The above problems and others are solved and the above 
purposes are realized through a method
