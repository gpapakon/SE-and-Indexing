<ABSTRACT>
A pole antenna (302) of a hand-held, portable communication device 
(102), such as a cellular telephone, is maintained in a substantially vertical 

orientation. An antenna mast (302) provides a support structure for the antenna. A 
pivot means (312) couples a medial portion of the antenna mast to a housing (404) of 

the communication device. The pivot means allows movement of the antenna mast 
about an axis of rotation. A weight is fixedly attached to the lower end of the 

antenna mast. The action of gravity acting on the weight maintains the antenna mast 
in a substantially vertical orientation as the housing of the communication device is 

tilted at an angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to portable hand-held 
communication devices. In existing cellular telephone networks, signals in the 900 MHz frequency 
band are communicated between a base station and a portable telephone. The base 
station antenna transmits vertically polarized signals. The portable units use simple 
pole (i.e., monopole or dipole) antennas. In order to maximize the signal level received by a portable unit, it is 
desirable to maintain the antenna of the portable unit in a vertical orientation. 
Unfortunately, most commercially available portable units have a fixed antenna 
generally oriented to align with the long axis of the unit. When the portable unit is 
held in alignment with the mouth and ear of a user, this generally orients the unit at 
approximately a 45° angle with respect to vertical. This results in a polarization 
mismatch with the vertically polarized signals being received from the base station. 
This polarization mismatch results in a loss in received signal power. For example, 
at a 45° angle from vertical, the received signal will have an amplitude 3 dB [i.e., 
20log(cos 45°)] lower than that received by a vertically oriented antenna. What is needed is a means for assuring a substantially vertical antenna 
orientation in portable units so that signal attenuation resulting from polarization 
mismatches can be minimized.  
 Patent Abstracts of Japan & JP-A-55 141 804 describes a means 
whereby a ship's antenna system can be reduced in size and cost by providing a 
weight at the bottom of the antenna so that it can be kept vertical. It is said that the 
fading due to the pitching and rolling and to reflection can be eliminated even when 
the antenna system is loaded on a ship. Patent Abstracts of Japan & JP-A-03 175 826 describes a means 
whereby a portable telephone set can be made highly sensitive, small, and thin by 
providing a rotation function for an antenna composed of a flat box type, and 
incorporating a whip antenna and an inversed F-antenna to the box. The portable 
telephone set has a box-type antenna part which is stored in the back of the telephone 
set and incorporates the antenna internally. The antenna is hinged on the back upper 
part of the main body. The fixation of the antenna stored in a recess is released by 
sliding a lock releasing lever in a direction such that a hinge permits the antenna to 
rotate 180°, i.e., to flip up so that the antenna part becomes higher than the upper 
surface of the main body at the time of usage. Because the antenna can be

A portable hand-held communication device (200) having a pole 
antenna element (204),
 
   CHARACTERIZED BY: 


an antenna mast (302 providing a support structure for said pole 
antenna element, said antenna mast having a first end (304) and second end (306), 

said antenna mast (302) having a pivot point (310) disposed between said first end 
(304) and said second end (306) and said second end (306) having a weight greater 

than that of said first end (304); and 
means for coupling said antenna mast to a housing, said coupling means 
comprising pivot means (312) at said pivot point allowing movement of said antenna 

mast (302) about said pivot point, whereby said antenna mast (302) is positioned by 
the action of gravity in substantially vertical orientation with said first end (304) 

above said second end (306). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the greater weight of said 
second end (306) of said antenna mast (302) is achieved by said second end (306) 

being substantially heavier than the first end (304). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the greater weight of said 
second end (306) of said antenna mast (302) is achieved by means of a weight (308) 

fixedly attached to said second end (306), and said pivot means comprises a pivot pin 
(312). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said communication device is 
a cellular telephone (200), 


said pivot means defines an axis of rotation (310) for coupling a medial 
portion of said antenna mast (302) to a housing (102) of said cellular telephone (200) 

so that a first end (304) of the antenna (204) extends out from said housing (102) and 
a second end (306) of the antenna (204) extends into said housing (102) and allows 

movement of said antenna mast (302) relative to said housing (102) about said axis 
of rotation (310); and 
said second end (306) of said antenna mast (302) has a weight (308) 
fixedly attached thereto.
