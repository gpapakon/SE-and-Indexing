<ABSTRACT>
Filter apparatus for filtering liquids comprising a hollow 
filter body (12) mounted in a housing (18) having an inlet 

port (22) for supplying liquid to be filtered to the 
interior of the housing. An outlet port (24) for filtered 

liquid communicates with the interior of the filter body. 
A motor (16) is arranged to rotate the filter body around 

a vertical axis and paddles on the filter body cause liquid 
to be filtered to flow in a direction around the axis. In 

operation, at least some of the matter, such as particulate 
matter held in suspension or carried by the liquid which is 

heavier than the liquid, is caused to be directed outwardly 
in a direction from said filter body towards said housing. 

This matter would also be downwardly directed towards the 
bottom of the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter apparatus
suitable for filtering liquids.According to the invention there is provided a filter
apparatus comprising
a hollow filter body mounted in a housing,inlet means for supplying liquid to be filtered to the
interior of the housing,filtered liquid outlet means communicating with the
interior of the filter body, andmeans for causing liquid to be filtered to flow in a
direction around an axis having a substantial vertical
component passing through said filter body characterised in
that the apparatus comprises at least one stator member
mounted in said filter body for substantially reducing the
rate of flow of said filtered liquid within said filter
body in the direction around said axis.Thus in operation, at least some of the matter, such
as particulate matter held in suspension or carried by the
liquid, which is heavier than the liquid, is caused to be
directed outwardly in a direction from said filter body
towards said housing. This matter would also be downwardly
directed towards the bottom of the housing.The rate of flow of the liquid to be filtered around
the axis is preferably such that a substantial proportion
of said matter does not contact the filter body before
being directed towards the housing, thus reducing the
likelihood of the filter material becoming clogged.In a preferred embodiment the filter body is fixedly
mounted on a shaft rotatable about said axis and means, 
such as an electric motor, is provided for rotating said
shaft. In such an embodiment said means for causing liquid
flow may comprise paddle means on said filter body. The
motor is preferably arranged to rotate the filter body at
high speed, typically 2000 r.p.m. to 8000 r.p.m.The filter body is preferably a right-circular
cylinder.The paddle means may comprise at least one elongate
member on the external surface of the filter body.
Preferably, a plurality of said paddle members are arranged
in spaced parallel relation around said filter body and
parallel to said axis.At least one rib member may be so arranged on the
internal wall of said housing so that the rib member in
combination with the paddle means imparts a downward
component force on the liquid to be filtered. Preferably
a plurality of rib members are arranged around said housing
in spaced parallel relationship.The internal wall of the housing may be inclined
outwardly in the direction towards its lower end and may be
coated with P.T.F.E. or other suitable low friction
material to facilitate easier downward movement of the
separat

Filter apparatus comprising:

a hollow filter body (12) mounted in a housing (18),
inlet means (122) for supplying liquid to be filtered
to the interior of said housing (18),
filtered liquid outlet means (24) communicating with
the interior of the filter body (12), and
means (16, 26) for causing liquid to be filtered to
flow in a direction around an axis (14) having a

substantial vertical component passing through said filter
body (12) characterised in that the apparatus comprises at

least one stator member (40) mounted in said filter body
for substantially reducing the rate of flow of said

filtered liquid within said filter body in the direction
around said axis.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the or each
stator member is a planar member directed radially

outwardly of said axis (14).
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the or each
stator member extends substantially the full internal

length of the filter body.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 2 or 3 comprising a
plurality of said stator members arranged substantially

symmetrically around said axis.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein
said means for causing liquid flow is so arranged as to

cause at least some of the matter, such as particulate
matter held in suspension or carried by the liquid which is

heavier than the liquid, to be directed outwardly in a
direction from said filter body towards said housing. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, comprising means for
so adjusting the rate of flow of the liquid around the axis

that a substantial proportion of said matter does not
contact the filter body before being directed towards the

housing.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the filter body is mounted on a shaft (14)

rotatable about said axis and means (16), such as an
electric motor, is provided fo
r rotating said filter body. 
Apparatus according to claim 7,
wherein a substantial

portion of said shaft extends through said filter body and
is formed hollow to its distal end to communicate with said

outlet means, said hollow portion being provided with at
least one aperture. 
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8, wherein said means for
causing liquid flow comprises paddle means (26) on said

filter body (12).
Apparatus according to claim 9, wherein said paddle
means comprises at least one elongate member (26) on the

external surface of the filter body, and parallel to said
axis.
Apparatus according to claim 10, comprising a plurality
of said paddle members arranged in spaced parallel relation

around said filter body.
Apparatus according to claim 9, 10 or 11, comprising at
least one rib member (28) so arranged on the internal wall

of said housing (18) that the rib member in combination
with the paddle means (26) imparts a downward component of

force on the liquid to be filtered.
Apparatus according to claim 12, comprising a
plurality of said rib members arranged around said housing

in spaced parallel relationship. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims
including means (32) for removing filtered material from

said housing.
