<ABSTRACT>
A receiver or preamplifier for differential signals, in particular electrocardiogram 
signals, includes 
n
 electrodes (25, 26) to provide at least one signal at an 
acceptable common mode rejection ratio, even if the subject to which the 

electrodes (25, 26) are applied has a different ground potential than the 
assigned monitor. This is achieved by two current sources (41, 42) which are 

controlled by a sum signal representing a sum of the electrode signals, said 
current sources (41, 42) injecting a corresponding current into the electrodes 

(25, 26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a receiver for differentially detecting biological 
signals of a patient, comprising at least two electrode contact points. More 
specifically, the invention relates to receiver circuitry used in electrocardiogram (ECG) 
amplifiers. Basically, the electrocardiogram is the most important physiological parameter 
for patient monitoring. However, the pick-up of ECG signals may cause technical 
problems which are - although identified already a long time ago - not easy to 
overcome. The most serious problem is caused by the fact that the patient may, for safety 
reasons, not be connected with the ground potential of the monitor. ECG monitors 
provide, in general, means for galvanic separation of the patient, such as transformers, 
optical couplers etc. The external ECG is not measured against ground, but rather as a differential 
signal; i.e., one needs at least two leads, and measures the ECG waveform as a 
voltage difference between these leads. This is just because the patient ground is 
floating and thus not stable, such that any measurement against monitor ground 
would reveal useless results. It is understood that more than two leads may be 
provided as well, in order to obtain multiple waveforms. The actual differential voltage of an external ECG signal is approximately in 
the range of 100 ÂµV to 10 mV. In contrast, the floating ground may cause common 
mode voltages (i.e., voltages appearing on both ECG leads) of up to (and even 
exceeding) 100 V. That is, the common voltages may be about 103 to 106 times larger 
in amplitude than the differential voltages. It is thus not easy to keep the differential amplifier in its operating range, i.e., 
to keep its common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) high. A well-known measure  
 
therefor is to isolate the differential amplifier galvanically from ground, which results 
in a CMRR improvement of at most 70 dB. The limiting factor of this first measure is 
the insulation capacitance of the galvanic separation, which includes the insulation 
capacitance of the electrical circuitry, and the capacitance of the patient leads with 
respect to ground. However, the max. 70 dB CMRR are not sufficient to provide a 
differential signal of acceptable quality. One has therefore to take other measures as well. One approach widely used 
in the prior art is the so-called "guard drive". In general, this means that the patient's 
ground potential is modified such that it approaches the ground potential of the 
"floating" portion of the pick-up
