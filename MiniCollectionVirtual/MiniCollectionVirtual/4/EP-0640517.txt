<ABSTRACT>
When an ignition switch detects that a key rotor of an 
ignition key cylinder has been turned to the accessory position 

by a key, a controller energizes a primary coil to cause it to 
output a high-frequency signal. In the key, a secondary 

battery is charged with a constant DC voltage generated from an 

AC voltage induced across a secondary coil. A transmission 
circuit is powered by the secondary battery, and allowed by a 

timer circuit to transmit a radio signal including an 
identification code during a predetermined period after the 

high-frequency signal is received by the key. Alternatively, 
the controller energizes the primary coil plural times with a 

cycle consisting of predetermined outputting and pause periods 
if the transmitted identification code does not coincide with 

a preset identification code at the first comparing attempt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicular anti-theft apparatus 
which includes a key to be inserted to an ignition key cylinder and 
incorporating a transmission circuit for transmission an air 
propagation signal and a battery as a DC power supply for the 
transmission circuit. A corresponding vehicular anti-theft apparatus is known from WO-A-93/0897 
which comprises on the car and ignition key cylinder having 
a key rotor into which a key is to be inserted and an ignition 
switch for producing a turn detection signal when detecting that the 
key rotor has been turned to a predetermined position. The key of 
this anti-theft apparatus includes a secondary battery, a 
transmission circuit power by said secondary battery for 
transmitting an air propagation signal including an identification 
code and a timer circuit for allowing the transmission circuit to 
transmit the air propagation signal. At the car side there is 
provided a comparing means for comparing the identification code 
included in the air propagation signal transmitted from the key and 
a pre-set identification code, and for producing a signal for 
allowing an engine to be started if the transmitted identification 
code and the pre-set identification code are identical. Recently, there have been manufactured automobiles showing such of 
the above mentioned anti-theft apparatuses implementing also a so 
called wireless door locking apparatus. In this apparatus, a 
transmission circuit 
and a battery as a DC power supply for the transmission circuit 
are provided in a base portion of a remote key that can be 
inserted into an ignition key cylinder and a door key cylinder. 
When a driver performs an operation to cause the transmission 
circuit to emit a radio signal, a reception signal judging 
means in a receiving circuit that is provided in an automobile 
decodes the radio signal and a controller outputs a drive 
signal to cause a door locking mechanism (electromotive 
actuator) to automatically lock or unlock a door. The above wireless door-locking apparatus is very 
convenient to the driver, because he can automatically lock or 
unlock the door simply by depressing an operation button to  
 
cause the transmission circuit to effect its transmission 
operation; that is, he need not insert the remote key into the 
door cylinder and turn it. However, with the conventional constitution, when the 
battery as the power supply for the transmission circuit has 
lost its energy, the transmission circuit cannot emit a radio 
signal, so that the
