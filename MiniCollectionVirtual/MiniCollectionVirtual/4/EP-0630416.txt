<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating aldehyde-tanned biological tissue minimizes in vivo calcification and reduces cytotoxicity without impairing the mechanical strength of the tanned tissue. The method includes the step of treating the aldehyde-tanned biological tissue with at least one liquid polyol having formula (I), where R is CH2OH or an alkyl group, and R' is H, an alkyl group or an O-acyl where the acyl is C2-C9 or a carboxyalkyl; or formula (II) where R is H or an alkyl group, and R' is H, an alkyl group, O-alkyl or O-carboxyalkyl. Preferred polyols are propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 2,3-butylene glycol and glycerol, and the polyol is preferably a diol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anticalcification treatment for aldehyde tanned
biological-tissue, and more particularly to such a treatment which minimizes in vivo
calcification and reduces cytotoxicity without impairing the mechanical strength of the
tanned tissue.When biological tissue containing the amino groups (NH2) characteristic of protein
are treated with glutaraldehyde (CHO(CH2)3CHO), the glutaraldehyde links the
amino-containing proteins together in cross-linking reactions. One of the resulting
cross-linked products is devoid of any free aldehyde groups because both aldehyde groups
of the glutaraldehyde react with different amino groups, but the other resulting cross-linked
product retains a free aldehyde group because both amino groups react with the same
aldehyde group of the glutaraldehyde. As both types of cross-linked products are present in
equilibrium with each other, the glutaraldehyde-tanned biological tissue will always contain
free aldehyde groups.The free aldehyde groups in an implant are associated with the induction of a local
inflammatory reaction and subsequent calcification of the graft. While vigorous washing of
the aldehyde-treated tissue is effective to remove unreacted glutaraldehyde, it is ineffective
to remove the free aldehyde groups of the glutaraldehyde which has reacted with the tissue
protein. The known treatments (e.g., amino acids in an acidic buffer) of the
aldehyde-tanned biological tissue to remove the free aldehyde groups from the
glutaraldehyde which has reacted with the tissue protein result in an impairment of the 
mechanical strength of the tanned tissue, thereby frustrating the very purpose of the tanning
treatment.Bioprosthetic heart valves in current use around the world are made or porcine
aortic valves or bovine pericardium tanned with glutaraldehyde. Biological arterial
substitutes are made of xenograft or homograft vessels treated with glutaraldehyde treated
bovine pericardium. Artificial heart valves made from glutaraldehyde treated tissue are
excellent substitutes for diseased natural valves, with a particularly low risk of
thromboembolism. Their utility is, however, compromised by the aforementioned tendency
to calcification which occurs in almost 100% of children within 5 years after implantation.
Adults with hyperparathyroidism or renal failure share this tendency. Calcification causes
failure of the implants, and the need for re-replacement is a bar to frequent use thereof
except in the elderly.The alternative of bioprosthetic valve
