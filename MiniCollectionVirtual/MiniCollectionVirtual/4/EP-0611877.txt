<ABSTRACT>
A catalytic exhaust gas cleaning device has a housing (3) contg. two or more spaced catalyst bodies (1) accommodated by an expansible mat (2). The novelty is that the mat consists of at least two layers, the outer layer (2a) extending continuously over the entire length of the catalyst bodies (1), and the inner layer (2b) consisting of at least two sections, each associated with a catalyst body (1). The inner layer (2b) is absent from the region between the catalyst bodies. Also claimed is an expansible mat for mounting two or more catalyst bodies in a common housing.

Catalytic exhaust gas purification device comprising a 
housing (3) and at least two catalytic members (1) mounted in the 

latter by means of a swelling mat (2) and arranged one behind the 
other with an axial spacing, characterised in that the swelling 

mat (2) is constructed with at least two layers, the outer layer 
(2a) of the swelling mat extending continuously substantially 

over the entire length of the catalytic members (1) and the inner 
layer (2b) consisting of at least two sections, each of which is 

associated with a catalytic member (1) so that the inner layer 
(2b) is missing at least in the intermediate region between two 

catalytic members. 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that the layers of the swelling mat (2) 

are stuck to each other. 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that the layers of the swelling mat (2) 

are staggered with respect to each other in the peripheral 
direction. 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that each section of the inner layer 

(2b) of the swelling mat (2) consists of two strips (4), which 
support the associated catalytic members (1) substantially on the 

end face. 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that applied to the inside of the inner 

layer (2b) of the swelling mat (2) is a metal foil (7) 
respectively connecting two sections thereof, as a gap cover. 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that the inwardly directed surface of 

the outer layer (2a) of the swelling mat is provided with a  
 

protective device at least in the intermediate region between the 
two catalytic members (1). 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 6, characterised in that the protective device consists of 

a coating with metal powder. 
Catalytic exhaust gas purification device according to 
Claim 6, characterised in that the protective device consists of 

a coating with hardened hardener liquid. 
Swelling mat (2) for supporting at least two catalyst 
members (1) in a colon housing (3), characterised in that it is 

constructed of at least two layers, the inner layer (2b) 
consisting of at least two sections arranged at a distance apart.
