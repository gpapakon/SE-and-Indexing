<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manifold for a heat exchanger
and to a heat exchanger incorporating such a manifold and to a
method of assembly thereof.Heat exchangers, such as are typically employed in air
conditioning systems for example for automobiles, generally
comprise a large number of heat exchange tubes which carry
coolant fluid, connected to a manifold. The manifold is
internally divided into a plurality of compartments including an
inlet compartment to which a fluid inlet line is connected, an
outlet compartment to which a fluid outlet line is connected,
and a further intermediate compartment or compartments, so that
a tortuous multi-pass path for coolant fluid is defined by the
manifold and heat exchange tubes. Heat exchange occurs between
the coolant fluid passing through the heat exchange tubes, and
surrounding air.Such internally divided manifolds are difficult to form and to
assemble. Conventionally, the manifold comprises two-half
shells in the form of a header part which is provided with
apertures for the heat exchange tubes, and a tank part. These
parts include internal walls cast, welded or brazed therein, and 
are connected together by, for example, brazing to form the
complete manifold. Such an arrangement requires the parts to be
formed with very high precision. If the walls are not very
accurately positioned they may obscure or partially obscure
openings in the manifold wall for the heat exchange tubes,
restricting fluid flow or causing leaking reduces the
effectiveness of heat transfer and functionality.It is also known to provide a unitary tubular manifold, into
which internal wall members are introduced and brazed in
position. For example, it has been proposed to form additional
slots in the manifold wall, through which internal baffles are
introduced and then brazed in position. A drawback of this
arrangement is that manufacture of the tubular wall is
complicated by the need to provide precision slots. These slots
also give rise to possible additional external leakage points.Other arrangements require the precision forming of seats or
locating surfaces on the inner surfaces of the manifold for the
internal partitions or baffles.It has also been proposed by the applicants to provide a unitary
tubular manifold, and to provide the internal walls as well as
end walls in the form of baffles which are held on a guide rail.
On assembly, the baffles are first located on the guide rail
which is subsequently introduced into the tubular manifold from
one end thereof. This arrangement
