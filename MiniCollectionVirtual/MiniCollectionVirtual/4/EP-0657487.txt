<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic
fluorosilicone resins, useful e.g.
for microcapsulating platinum catalysts, as a
coating agent for car wax, and an additive for
engineering plastics. It also relates to
methods for preparing the same.Conventional vehicles used for heat
resistant paint and weather resistant paint
include silicone resins containing a silanol or
alkoxysilyl group as a functional group and
having compositions: CH3SiO3/2, C6H5SiO3/2,
(C6H5SiO3/2)·[(CH3)2SiO], and
(C6H5SiO3/2)·(n-C3H7SiO3/2). Since these
conventional silicone resins are thermosetting,
the paint compositions can gel with the lapse of
time.It is also known to add these resins to 
thermoplastic molding resins for improving mold
release, flame retardancy and moldability.
However, addition of thermosetting silicone
resins is not recommended for those resins
having high molding temperatures. In this
regard, Japanese Patent Application Kokai (JP-A)
No. 2282/1993 proposes a thermoplastic
silicone resin, in which residual silanol groups
are capped.For stabilizing platinum-catalyzed
addition type silicone compositions during
storage, JP-A 4833/1990 proposes to micro-capsulate
a platinum catalyst by carrying the
platinum catalyst on a thermoplastic silicone
resin as mentioned above, comminuting the resin
into a microparticulate powder, and washing the
particulates with methanol to remove the
platinum catalyst from the outer surface. Since
this silicone resin, however, is soluble in
vinylmethylpolysiloxane and methylhydrogenpolysiloxane,
it is less effective for providing
storage stability, especially in the summer
season even if its softening point is elevated.For the purpose of reducing solubility in
vinylmethylpolysiloxane and methylhydrogenpolysiloxane, 
polysiloxane, JP - A 323223/1992 proposes a
thermoplastic silicone resin of the formula:
(CF3CH2CH2SiO3/2)n·((CH3)2SiO)m. Since this resin,
however, has a low softening point due to
inclusion of a D unit, storage stability is
little improved. By reducing the value of m,
the softening point can be increased, but at the
sacrifice of compatibility with organic
solvents. Then diethyl ether, Freon 113 and
other industrially undesirable solvents are
necessary in order to blend a platinum catalyst
with the resin in a solution form.For preparing microcapsulated platinum
catalysts which are insoluble in vinylmethylpolysiloxane
and methylhydrogenpolysiloxane,
JP-A 47442/1989 and 51140/1989 propose to use
ethylenic polymers such as acrylic resin,
polyvinyl alcohol, and styrene -
