<DESCRIPTION>
 METAL FILLED ADHESIVE COMPOSITION AND METHODBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical FieldThis invention relates to adhesive compositions comprising an ethylenically unsaturated compound. In another aspect, this invention relates to adhesive compositions comprising a particulate metallic filler. This invention also relates to methods of adhering a restorative material to a substrate, and in another aspect to methods of adhering a dental restorative such as amalgam to hard tissue such as dentin or enamel.Description of the Related ArtDental amalgams and restorative composites are used extensively for intracoronal and extracoronal restorations. Amalgam, however, does not adhere to tooth structure and the dentist must prepare the tooth cavity with dovetails and various cutout grooves that mechanically lock the amalgam into the cavity. Such preparation, however, results in excavation of more tooth structure than would otherwise be necessary if there was good adhesion between the tooth structure and the amalgam. Moreover, leakage at the interface of the amalgam and cavity wall (known as "microleakage") tends to occur. This microleakage allows penetration of bacteria, soluble salts, and saliva into any space between the amalgam and tooth structure. This can lead to inflammation, pulp irritation, demineralization of the tooth, corrosion of the amalgam, and other attendant complications. An adhesive seal between amalgam and tooth structure could minimize and/or prevent microleakage and allow for a stronger restoration due to excavation of less tooth material. Products claiming to make amalgam adhesive to tooth structure are available. One such product is 

 sold in a kit under the trademark AMALGAMBOND™ (Parkell Co.). This product is a liquid adhesive to be coated directly onto tooth structure. The active ingredients in the adhesive include 4-META (4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitic anhydride) and TBB (tri-n butyl borane) . Other products which similarly involve coating a specific curable resin directly onto tooth structure to make amalgam adhere are available under the trademarks PANAVIA™ Dental Adhesive (Kuraray Company) and SUPERBOND™ Adhesive (Sun Medical Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) . These latter products also are difficult to employ, since there are a number of required preparatory steps for their application and curing.Articles that describe bonding of amalgam to tooth structure by precoating the tooth with ethylenically unsaturated adhesive resin include M. Staninec and M. Holt, Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS :
1. An adhesive composition, comprising:
(i) an ethylenically unsaturated compound; (ii) a particulate metallic filler that does not interfere with the cure of the ethylenically unsaturated compound, in an amount effective to increase adhesion of amalgam to tooth structure when the composition is used as an intermediate layer between the amalgam and the tooth structure, compared to the adhesion obtained using a like composition absent the particulate metallic filler; and
(iii) a curing agent in an amount sufficient to effect cure of the composition.
2. A composition according to Claim 1, wherein the ethylenically unsaturated compound comprises a phosphorylated compound.
3. A composition according to Claim 2, wherein the phosphorylated compound comprises a chlorophosphorus acid ester of Bis-GMA.
4. A composition according to Claim 1, wherein the ethylenically unsaturated compound comprises a phosphorous-free compound.
5. A composition according to Claim 1, wherein the ethylenically unsaturated compound comprises a mixture of at least one phosphorylated compound and at least one phosphorous-free compound.
6. A composition according to Claim 1, wherein the particulate metallic filler has an average particle size of about 1 micron to about 100 microns. 


 7. A composition according to Claim 1, wherein the particulate metallic filler has an average particle size of about 1 micron to about 50 microns.
8. A composition according to Claim 1, wherein the particulate metallic filler is a dental amalgam alloy powder.
9. A method of adhering a restorative material to a substrate, comprising the steps of:
(i) combining the components of a composition according to Claim 1;
(ii) placing an intermediate layer of the composition from step (i) on one member of the restorative material/substrate pair;
(iii) optionally curing the intermediate layer; and
(iv) adhering the other member of the restorative material/substrate pair to the first member by way of the intermediate layer.
