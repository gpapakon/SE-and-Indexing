<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of acoustic wave
filters, in particular to surface-acoustic- and leaky-wave filters and
more particularly to acoustic wave filters employing cascaded
transducers.There is an ongoing need for component miniaturization in radio
wave communication devices. For example, smaller and more efficient
components are needed for light-weight, hand-portable cellular
telephones, wireless local area networks for linking computer systems
within office buildings in a readily reconfigurable fashion, wristwatch- and
credit-card-sized paging apparatus and other devices for promoting
rapid, efficient and flexible voice and data communication.Filters are needed for a variety of such communications
applications wherein small size, light weight and high performance are
simultaneously required. Increasing numbers of products seek to
employ fixed spectral resources, often to achieve tasks not previously
envisioned. Examples include cellular telephones, inter- and intra-facility
computer-computer and/or computer-ancillary equipment
linkages as well as a host of other, increasingly complex inter-personal
and/or -equipment information sharing requirements. The desire to
render increasingly complicated communications nodes portable and
even hand-held and/or -portable and/or pocket-sized places extreme
demands on filtering technology in the context of increasingly crowded
radio frequency resources.Acoustic wave filters provide filters meeting stringent
performance requirements which are (i) extremely robust, (ii) readily
mass produced, (iii) adjustment-free over the life of 
the unit and which (iv) sharply increase the performance to
size ratio achievable in the frequency range extending from a
few tens of MegaHertz to about several GigaHertz. However,
need for low passband insertion loss simultaneously coupled
with demand for high shape factor and high stopband
attenuation pose filter design and performance requirements
not easily met by a single acoustic wave filter alone.One approach to satisfying these needs and demands is to
cascade two or more acoustic wave filters. This approach
realizes increased stopband signal rejection but requires
additional matching components (e.g., inductors and/or
capacitors) and also multiplies the volume and weight of the
acoustic wave filters by the number of such filters cascaded.
Matching components additionally incur major size and weight
penalties because each transducer generally requires at least
two matching components, each of which is at
