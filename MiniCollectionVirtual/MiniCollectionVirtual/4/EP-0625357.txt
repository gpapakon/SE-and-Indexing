<ABSTRACT>
A pleural drainage unit comprising three chambers 
(1, 2 and 3) of upwardly decreasing cross-section and 

with opposable lateral faces which join together to form 
an assembly of approximately semi-trunco-conical 

configuration which includes a reversible handle (14). 
The first chamber (1), for collecting liquids,, is 

provided on its upper with a flexible nozzle (12) to 
which the patient's probe is connected, and on its front 

wall a level indicator (13). The second and third 
chambers (2 and 3) are provided with means of checking 

the level of liquid inside as well as caps for closure 
and connection to a vacuum system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pleural drainage 
unit designed to collect the liquids and gases which may 
be produced in the pleural cavity in certain patients or 
in certain situations. The pleural drainage units consist three chambers, a 
first chamber for collecting pleural liquids, a second 
chamber for sealing and a third chamber for suction 
control. The first and second chambers are interconnected 
by means of a tube which leads from the first 
chamber, at a point above the maximum level which the 
liquids can reach in said chamber, and opens in the 
second chamber, at a point close to the bottom thereof. 
There is an interconnection between the second and third 
chambers between points situated above the maximum level 
of liquid in said chambers. Furthermore, the third 
chamber is provided with a tube which extends nearly to 
the bottom of said chamber and which opens above to the 
exterior.  The units of this type currently in use constitute 
excessively bulky assemblies which are difficult for the 
patient to transport and which furthermore are not 
provided with easily readable check elements. However, it is desirable that these pleural drainage 
units allow both the checking of their operation as well 
as the reading of the levels to be carried out simply and 
rapidly, and furthermore that they can be transported 
comfortably by the patient who has to live with the unit 
for a certain period of time. In other words, the 
drainage unit should satisfy a number of ergonomic 
factors as far as both the patient and the second 
operator in charge of checking the unit are concerned. The object of the present invention is to develop an 
autonomous pleural drainage unit which is constituted in 
such a way that the various component parts form a stable 
assembly which can be transported easily by the patient 
and which is provided with means for making it easy to 
handle, check and position the unit, at the same time as 
ensuring perfect operation in the purpose for which said 
unit is designed. According to the present invention the three 
chambers which form the drainage unit are of upwardly 
decreasing cross-section and have opposable lateral faces 
which join together to form an approximately semi-trunco-conical 
assembly provided with a reversible handle or 
hook. The integration of the various parts or components 
of a single assembly constitutes one of the essential 
design characteristics of the unit of the invention since  
 
it enables the separation of the connections to be 
reduced,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pleural drainage unit comprising three 
independent chambers, a first chamber for collecting 

pleural liquids, a second chamber for sealing and a third 
chamber for suction control, said chambers being 

consecutively interconnected by means of a first interconnection 
which leads from the first chamber, from a 

point situated above the maximum level which the liquids 
can reach, and opens in the second chamber, at a point 

close to the bottom, and by means of a second interconnection 
which runs between points of the second and 

third chambers situated above the maximum level of liquid 
in said chambers, the third chamber being further 

provided with a tube which leads from a point close to 
the bottom and opens above to the outside, characterized 

in that the three chambers are of upwardly decreasing 
cross-section and have opposable lateral faces which join 

together to form an assembly of approximately semi-trunco-conical 
configuration, provided with a reversible 

handle or hook and a clip for fixing the probe to the 
clothes, the first chamber being provided on its upper 

face with a flexible nozzle to which the patient's probe 
is connected, and on its front wall a level indicator, 

the second and third chambers being provided with means 
of checking the level of liquid inside as well as caps 

for closure and connection to a vacuum system. 
A unit according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the first chamber for collecting liquids is provided 

on its front wall with at least one transparent, vertical 
channel in which an indicator is externally mounted and 

can moved and fixed elastically along said channel. 
A unit according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the second and third chamber are subdivided into two 

compartments, a lower one of large dimensions designed to 
 

contain the liquid necessary for the operation of the 
assembly, and an upper one of lower capacity which is 

connected to the lower compartment by means a valve which 
can be operated from the outside, the size of the upper 

compartment being such that it can contain the quantity 
of liquid which the lower compartment will need when the 

assembly is in use. 
A unit according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the interconnection tube between the first and 

second chambers, and the tube which leads from the third 
chamber to the outside, are each provided with a long, 

lower section which runs parallel to and close to the 
bottom of the corresponding chamber.
