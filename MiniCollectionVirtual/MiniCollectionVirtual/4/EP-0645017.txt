<ABSTRACT>
There is described a liquid dispensing system for the transfer of liquids from one location to another. The liquid dispensing system includes a pipette in combination with a sound source and a sound detector. The liquid dispensing system can be used in combination with an automated clinical analyzer and can be utilized to provide one or more of a number of functions including sensing the proximity of a pipette tip to a surface, determining the depth to which a pipette tip has penetrated into a volume of liquid, determining whether a pipette tip has been affixed to a pipette stem and determining the amount of liquid aspirated into a pipette tip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for aspirating
and/or dispensing liquid through the use of a disposable
pipette tip and to a method for controlling movement of a
pipette in a liquid aspirating and/or dispensing system.
The invention has particular application to a liquid
dispensing system for use in clinical analyzers.Pipettes are employed in automated analyzers for
transporting liquids between reservoirs which hold liquid
samples and/or reagents and for transporting liquids from
such reservoirs to test sites such as in assay cartridges
to conduct various tests. The pipette is typically
carried by a transport mechanism which provides for both
horizontal and vertical movement so as to enable the
pipette tip to be lowered into a liquid in a reservoir for
aspiration of the liquid, and for transporting the liquid
to a test site whereat the pipette is lowered to an
optimal position for dispensing the liquid. Some type of
device, such as a piston assembly, which may be
incorporated into the pipette, is operated electronically
to aspirate liquid into the pipette and to dispense liquid
from the pipette.Various types of chemical tests can be performed by
such automated test equipment, an example of testing of
considerable interest being the assay of biological
substances for 
human health care. Automated test equipment allows large
numbers of test samples to be processed rapidly. Such equipment
is employed in health care institutions including hospitals and
laboratories. Biological fluids, such as whole blood, plasma or
serum are tested to find evidence of disease, to monitor
therapeutic drug levels, etc. In such automated analyzers
disposable pipette tips are typically used for the delivery of one
liquid only and then discarded so as to avoid contamination which
could lead to errors in the assay result.It is desirable, when aspirating liquid into the pipette
tip, to lower the orifice of the pipette tip into the liquid to a
controlled distance which is sufficient for the aspiration of the
desired amount of liquid. Inaccurate positioning of the pipette tip
relative to the surface of the liquid may introduce an error in the
amount of liquid aspirated into the tip. Further, lowering the tip
into the liquid to an excessive distance increases the possibility
that a small amount of liquid may adhere to the outside wall of the
pipette tip when the tip is withdrawn from the liquid. Liquid
adhering to the outer wall of the pipette tip could result in an
inaccurate amount of fluid being dispensed.The use of disposable
