<ABSTRACT>
Hydroxyl-containing materials, in particular fibre materials, such as cellulose fibre materials, which have been modified with an amino-containing compound are dyed as such or in a blend with polyester fibres with the aid of a fibre-reactive disperse dye in an aqueous, low-electrolyte or completely electrolyte-free medium and in the absence of an alkaline or alkali-donating agent at a temperature of between 100 and 210 DEG C. Not only the modified cellulose-containing material but also the polyester material can be dyed in one and the same dyeing process with one and the same fibre-reactive disperse dye. A uniform overall dyeing not only of the modified hydroxl-containing material but also of the polyester material is obtained.
