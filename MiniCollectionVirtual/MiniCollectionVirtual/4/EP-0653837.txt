<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an LC element capable of
attenuating a predetermined frequency band and used either as
part of a semiconductor or other device, or as a discrete
element, a semiconductor device including such an LC element
and a method for manufacturing such an LC element.The rapid advancement of electronics technology in recent
years has brought about the use of electronic circuits in an
increasingly broad range of fields. Therefore, stable
operation of these electronic circuits is sought without being
affected by external conditions.However, electronic circuits are directly or indirectly
subject to the incursion of external noise. Consequently, there is a
problem in that operating errors may be caused in electronic
products using electronic circuits.In particular, there are many cases of using switching
regulators as electronic circuit DC power supplies. As a
result of transient current produced by such operations as
switching, or by load fluctuations arising from switching
operation of utilized digital ICs, intense noise having many
frequency components is often produced in the switching
regulator power supply line. This noise is conveyed via the 
power supply line or by radiation to other circuits in the
same product, giving rise to such effects as operating error
and impaired signal to noise ratio, and in some cases even
causing operating error in other nearby electronic products.Various types of noise filters are presently being used
with respect to electronic circuits in order to remove noise.
In particular, since a great many electronic products of
numerous types have come into use in recent years, the
regulations against noise have grown ever more stringent, and
development of an LC element having functions as a compact
high performance noise filter capable of reliably removing
such noise is desired.One example of this type of LC element is an LC noise
filter disclosed in JP-A-3-259608.
In the case of this LC noise filter, the L
(inductance) and C (capacitance) components exist as
distributed constants, and compared to a lumped constant type
LC filter, favorable attenuation response can be obtained over
a relatively wide band.However, manufacturing process of this LC noise filter is
complicated because this LC noise filter is formed by folding
an insulation sheet which has been provided with the conductor
on both sides to form the inductor and the capacitor.Also, wiring is required when directly inserting this LC
filter into an IC or LSI power supply or signal line, thus
