<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dynamic
image processor for temporally analyzing the motion of
each individual object contained in a given dynamic
image, extracting motional data for the individual
object, storing the data, and/or plotting the motion of
the individual object in the dynamic image according to
the stored motional data.A color image plotted on an x-y plane may be
processed in a three-dimensional vector field with use of
an axis z orthogonal to the x-y plane. This technique is
disclosed in Japanese Patent applications
JP-A-63 299 594, JP-A-1 213 761, JP-A-2 208 781, JP-A-3 267 879, JP-A-4 287 180.
These disclosures extract an edge (including a
position where chromaticity changes) out of a color image
according to facts that, when the color image is a still
image (i.e., a static image), divergence and rotation
processes carried out on color image signals provide
substantially a value of zero, and that these processes
provide large values at positions where the chromaticity
of the image suddenly changes.To detect the motion of a dynamic image, a
prior art selects an objective point on each individual
object in the image, finds points correlated to the
objective point according to the positions of the point
at different timing, and calculates motional vectors
according to distance vectors for the correlated points.The dynamic image processing according to the
prior art involves complicated steps to find the
correlated points. Further, it is often troublesome to
adequately extract fundamental parameters which are
necessary for expressing the motion of the dynamic image. 
Namely, since too many correlated points must be found on
each individual object in a dynamic image, the prior art
involves a large number of processes, in order to detect
the motion of the dynamic image.An exemplary prior art disclosure of this kind is represented by the
article "Shape and Motion of Nonrigid Bodies", by S. Chen and
M. Penne, in COMPUTER VISION, GRAPHICS AND IMAGE PROCESSING, vol. 36,
nos. 2-3, November-December 1986, pages 175-207, Duluth, MA, USA.In view of the above-described problems existing in
the prior art, the main object of the present invention
is to provide a dynamic image processor, which allows the
motion of the individual object in a dynamic image to be
easily grasped by dividing the motion into rigid motion
and non-rigid deformable motion. Hereinafter, such a
non-rigid deformable motion is referred to as a soft
deformable motion.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a dynamic
