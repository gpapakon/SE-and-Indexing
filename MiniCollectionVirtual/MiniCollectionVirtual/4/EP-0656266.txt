<ABSTRACT>
A rubber composition for steel belts, which 
comprises 100 parts of the rubber component, 40 to 

50 parts of carbon black having an iodine adsorption 
number of 60 to 100mg/g and a DBP absorption number 

of 60 to 110mℓ/100g, 1 to 3 parts of a cobalt salt 
of an organic acid, and 2.5 to 3.5 parts of sulfur. 

The rubber composition provides in tyres 
contributing a lowering of the fuel consumption of a 

car because of lower rolling resistance and 
excellence in noise level, handling stability and 

ride comfort.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber 
composition for steel belts, which can provide tires 
assuring a low rolling resistance, low noise, and 
excellent handling stability and riding comfort. The recent demand for resource and energy savings 
requires tires for cars to be low in rolling resistance 
and light in weight in order to decrease fuel consumption. 
For lowering the rolling resistance, such improvements as 
decreasing a hysteresis loss of a tread rubber have been 
made. However the decrease in hysteresis loss of the 
tread rubber causes problems such that handling stability 
becomes lowered and noise becomes large. The present invention is made to solve the 
above-mentioned problems and provides a rubber composition 
for tires having a low noise, excellent handling stability 
and riding comfort, and lowered rolling resistance. As a result of the inventors' intensive studies 
for solving the above-mentioned problems, it was 
discovered that a tire having a lowered rolling resistance 
could be obtained without making worse a noise level, 
handling stability and riding comfort, by using a rubber 
for steel belts, that is to say, a rubber for covering 
steel belts, in which a specific carbon black, a cobalt 
salt of an organic acid and sulfur are blended in the 
specific ratio, and thus the present invention has been 
completed. According to the present invention, there can be 
provided a rubber composition for steel belts, which 
comprises 100 parts (part by weight, hereinafter the same) 
of a rubber component, 40 to 50 parts of a carbon black 
having an iodine adsorption number of 60 to 100 mg/g and a 
dibuthyl phthalate (hereinafter referred to as "DBP")  
 
absorption number of 60 to 110 mℓ /100 g, 1 to 3 parts of 
the cobalt salt of the organic acid and 2.5 to 3.5 parts 
of sulfur. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic sectional view showing a 
method to measure a rolling resistance of a tire. The rubber component to be used in the present 
invention is not specifically limited. Preferred rubber 
component is a natural rubber and an isoprene rubber from 
viewpoints of good processability, low heat generation and 
excellent adhesion. Those rubbers may be used in an 
admixture mixed in an optional mixing ratio. The rubber composition of the present invention 
is prepared by blending, per 100 parts of the rubber 
component, 40 to 50 parts, preferably 40 to 45 parts of 
the carbon black having the iodine adsorption number of 60 
to 100 mg/g, preferably 80 to 100 mg/g and the DBP 
absorption number of 60 to
