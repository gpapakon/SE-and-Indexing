<ABSTRACT>
A throughput fibre (4) for an optical fibre tap 
coupler is provided with an elliptical optical 

surface (8) by positioning the throughput fibre (4) in a 
circular groove (20) in a stainless steel jig (10) and 

polishing or cutting away a portion (4') of the 
throughput fibre (4), which portion (4') projects beyond 

flats (24) of the jig (10), the flats (24) being 
tangential to the groove (20). A tap fibre (6) for the 

coupler is provided with inclined, end elliptical 
optical surface (14) by inserting the fibre (6) through 

a bore (42) in a further stainless steel jig and 
polishing or cutting away a portion of the tap fibre 

(6) which projects beyond an inclined surface of the 
jig. The angle of the inclined surface in 

relation to the longitudinal axis of the bore 
determines the area of the end optical surface (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of an 
optical fibre tap coupler comprising an optical 
throughput fibre and an optical tap fibre. It is desirable to provide coupling between optical 
fibres, so-called tap couplers, for the splitting of 
optical signals from a single fibre. This is normally 
accomplished by joining the fibres in some manner. It is shown in U.S. Patent 4,669,820 where two 
fibres can be joined by grinding the surfaces of the 
fibres and joining them together. While this is in 
principal a good splicing technique, improvements have 
been made to this teaching making substantial 
enhancements to the tap connection. In the teaching of 
U.S. Patent 4,669,820, the fibres are ground to a 
position well into the core of the material, and then 
joined such that the joined fibre center is not at the 
apex of the fiber, but rather offset from it. As the 
evanescent and refractive coupling of the fibres is 
maximized at the apex, the coupling is not as efficient 
as it could be. Furthermore, the fibre is not ground at 
the free end of the fibre which too would have an effect 
on the optical quality of the splice. It is an object of the invention therefore to 
provide an improved optical tap fibre. In order to provide an effective optical connection 
between the throughput fibre and the tap fibre, the 
throughput fibre must be formed with an elliptical 
optical surface extending lengthwise thereof and the tap 
fibre must be formed with an elliptical optical surface 
extending obliquely across an end of the tap fibre. The present invention is intended to provide a tap 
coupler and a method of producing the same, as well as an 
apparatus for, accurately forming said elliptical optical 
surfaces so that a desired light splitting ratio and low 
light loss are achieved.  According to one aspect thereof, an optical fibre 
tap coupler (2), comprises a length of throughput fibre 
(4), and a tap fibre (6), where the tap coupler is 
characterized in that the throughput fibre (4) includes 
a first elliptical optical surface (8) extending 
lengthwise of the throughput fibre (4) and an end of the 
tap fibre (6) includes a second elliptical optical 
surface (14) extending obliquely across said end of the 
tap fibre (6), the two optical surfaces being joined to 
form an optical interface. According to another aspect thereof, the invention 
consists in a method of preparing an optical throughput 
fibre and/or a plastic optical tap fibre, for an optical 
tap coupler, the method being characterized by the
