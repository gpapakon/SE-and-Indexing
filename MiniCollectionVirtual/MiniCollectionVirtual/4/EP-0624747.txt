<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is for a deflective or flexible tube 
having an essentially smooth inner surface. The tube comprises 

in its longitudinal direction several with each other identical 
sections. These are characterized by that each section can be 

said to be divided in to parts (1,2) in its longitudinal direction 
whereby the first part (1) has an smooth inner surface. The first 

part (1) further has an outer dimension which is close to the inner 
dimension of the second part (2) whereby the first part (1) of one 

section can be inserted into the second part (2) of an adjacent 
section. The parts (1,2) are of about the same length and the smooth 

inside of the first parts (1) will therefore form the inside of the 
tube. 
For the assembly of the sections to a tube the tube walls are 
bent so that between the first (1) and the second part (2) of each 

section there is an L-shaped projection (3). In the outer end of 
the second part there is as an end of the tube section a second 

L-shaped projection (5) which is similiar to the first projection (3) 
but has somewhat greater dimensions so that the second 

projection (5) grips around the first (3) one in such a way that some 
movement is possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is for a flexible tube made from thin-walled 
goods. The invention primarily is for an inset tube 
for chimney flues and the tubes are then generally made from 
a suitable quality of steel. Deflective or flexible tubes have been used both as insets for 
existing chimney flues and in the manufacture of chimneys. 
Hereby the inner surface of the chimney flue is formed by the 
tube and its inside is in direct contact with the smoke. The 
inside of the tubes is therefore exposed both to the influence 
of the temperature of the gases and to the influence of 
chemical compounds, e.g. components which are condensed from 
the smoke. There is also formed on the inside of the tubes a 
layer which shall be removed by the sweeping. In order to obtain flexibility of the tubes these are either 
made by spirally winding bands which are connected by folding 
or from a required number of sections which are relatively 
short in the longitudinal direction of the tube and which in a 
suitable way are attached to each other. In order to obtain the 
necessary stiffness of the sections of the tubes, their walls 
are often corrugated. The inside of the tubes are therefore not 
smooth but corrugations and connections cause an uneven surface 
with slits and pockets which cause problems by the sweeping. IN CH-436 877 there are disclosed tubes which comprise a 
number of identical sections which are inserted one into 
another to form a tube of desired length. The tubes disclosed 
have no flexibility and there are no connecting means, 
adjacent sections are simply inserted one into another. Each 
tube section has two parts which preferrably are of equal 
length. The purpose of this is said to be to obtain stronger 
walls. There is no mentioning of smooth inner walls. US-A-2 978 261 discloses a double-wall vent made of a plurality of sections fitted together. The present invention is for a flexible tube 
which has an essentially smooth inner surface. The tube 
comprises in its longitudinal direction several identical 
sections. Each section can 
be said to have in its longitudinal direction two parts, the 
first of which has a smooth inner surface. Also the first part 
has an outer dimension which is close to the inner dimension of 
the second part, whereby the first part of one section can be  
  
 
inserted into a second part of an adjacent section. The parts 
have essentially the same length and the smooth inner surfaces 
of the first parts will therefore be the inside of the tubes.

<CLAIMS>
Flexible tube having an outer layer and an inner, 
layer having a smooth inner surface, and comprising several identical 

sections which are connected to each other to form 
the tube, wherein each section in its longitudinal direction 

has two parts, of which the first part has a smooth inner 
surface and outer dimensions which are close to the inner 

dimensions of the second part of the tube, so that the first 
part of one section can be inserted into the second part of an 

adjacent section 
characterized therein
 that each second part has 
corrugations, which form the outer layer (2) enclosing 

the first part of an adjacent section, (1) and that each section at one of its ends 
and being part of the second part has a first projection 

(5) wich encloses a corresponding second 
projection (3, 4) at the adjacent section with some movement therebetween for flexibly 

holding the sections together. 
Flexible tube according to claim 1, 
characterized therein
 
that the first part (1) of each section extends so far 

into an adjacent section that said first part extends 
in to the level of the second projection (4), which is 

parallel with the tube, but not into the full length of the 
second projection.
