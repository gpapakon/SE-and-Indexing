<ABSTRACT>
An image transfer method uses an image-forming material 
comprising a substrate 17, a photosensitive layer 18 formed on 

the substrate and a protective film 19 exfoliatively attached 
to the photosensitive layer. The method comprises mounting a 

sheet of the image-forming material on a roller 8, peeling off 
the protective film 19, and introducing the image-forming 

material into a nip formed between the roller 8 and another 
surface 1 so that the photosensitive layer 18 of the image-forming 

material and an image receptor come into contact with 
each other selectively to transfer part of the photosensitive 

layer to the image receptor to produce an image thereon. The 
protective film 19 has previously been attached to the 

photosensitive layer 18 with the substrate 17 tensioned at 
substantially right angles to the axis of the roller 8. 

Accordingly, when the protective film 19 is peeled off, the 
substrate 17 stretches tightly around the roller 8 to eliminate 

undesirable crinkling, thereby improving image transfer 
quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image transfer
method. More specifically, it relates to an image transfer
method using an image-forming material consisting
essentially of a substrate, a colouring photosensitive layer
and a protection film, which permits excellent registration
and therefore gives an aesthetically fine multi-colour
prepress proof or print.Single-colour and multi-colour prepress proof sheets
suitable for proof printing have been recently increasingly
produced by imagewise exposing photosensitive layer(s) of
image-forming material(s) to form image(s) and transferring
the image(s) to an image receptor under heat, generally
around 100°C. The image-forming material is generally
formed of a substrate, a photosensitive layer (formed on
one surface of the substrate) and a protection film, for
instance as disclosed in document EP-A-0,350,195. The
substrate and the protection film is selected from thin
films or sheets formed from a material such as cellulose
acetate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene
terephthalate. The image receptor is selected from paper
and a film. The photosensitive layer contains a dye and/or
a pigment and a photopolymerizable compound.For producing the above prepress proof sheet,
there has been proposed an image transfer method in
which a platen, to which an image-forming material is
attached, and a transfer cylinder, to which an image
receptor is attached, are rotated so that a photosensitive
layer of the image-forming material and an image
receptor are brought into contact with each other
under pressure, whereby an image formed in the 
photosensitive layer by imagewise exposing is transferred
to the image receptor in a nip portion formed by the platen
and the transfer cylinder. A multi-colour print or
prepress proof sheet is produced by colour-scanning an
original of a multi-colour image, imagewise exposing image-forming
materials corresponding to separated colours, e.g.,
yellow, magenta, cyan and black to form images of these
colours in the image forming materials (one image of one
colour in one image-forming material), and consecutively
transferring these formed images to one image receptor.For attaching the image-forming material to the
platen, a pin bar is generally used to facilitate the
registering of each colour. The pin bar has a structure in
which a plurality of pins are provided on a plate extending
in the axial direction of the platen. However, the
registering accuracy with the pin bar has not yet been
fully satisfactory.It is an aim of the

A sheet of image-forming material (16) for use
in an image transfer method in which the sheet (16) is

mounted on a roller (8) and a nip is formed between
the roller (8) and another surface (1), the sheet

comprising a photosensitive layer (18), a protective film

(19) exfoliatively attached to the photosensitive layer
(18) and a substrate (17) positioned on the other side of

the photosensitive layer (18) to the protective film (19);

characterised in that

   the substrate (17) is held in tension by the
protective film (19) in a direction that will correspond to

the direction of rotation of the roller (8), in use.
A sheet as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
elastic strain percentage (B) of the substrate (17) is

greater than the elastic strain percentage (A) of the
protective film (19).
A sheet as claimed in claim 2, wherein, prior
to the photosensitive layer (18), the protective film (19)

and the substrate (17) being layered together, the ratio
(B/A) of the elastic strain percentage of the substrate

(17) to the elastic strain percentage of the protective
film (19) is between 2 and 20.
A sheet as claimed in claim 3, wherein the said
ratio (B/A) is between 5 and 18.
A sheet as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4, 
wherein prior to the photosensitive layer (18), the

protective film (19) and the substrate (17) being layered
together, the ratio (B/A) of the elastic strain percentage

of the substrate (17) to the elastic strain percentage of
the protective film (19) varies by up to ± 20% across the

width of the image-forming material (16) in a direction
perpendicular to the direction of rotation of the roller
