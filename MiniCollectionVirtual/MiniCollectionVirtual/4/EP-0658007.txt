<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement for the analog/digital conversion of frequency-modulated intermediate-frequency signals and for converting them down to the baseband, the intermediate-frequency signals can be supplied to a sample-and-hold circuit which samples the intermediate-frequency signals at a given sampling rate. The sample-and-hold circuit is connected to two high-pass sigma/delta converters which are alternately supplied with the samples extracted from the sample-and-hold circuit. Outputs of the high-pass sigma/delta converters are connected to mixers which are supplied with mixed signals having a frequency of one half of the sampling rate.

Circuit arrangement for the analogue/digital
conversion of frequency-modulated intermediate

frequency signals and for the reduction thereof into
the baseband, characterized


in that the intermediate frequency signals can be
fed to a sample-and-hold circuit (2) which samples

the intermediate frequency signals at a given
sampling rate,
in that two high-pass sigma-delta converters (5,
6) are connected to the sample-and-hold circuit

(2), the samples derived from the sample-and-hold
circuit (2) being fed alternately to the said

high-pass sigma-delta converters, and
in that outputs of the high-pass sigma-delta
converters (5, 6) are connected to mixers (7, 8),

to which mixing signals are fed at a frequency of
one half of the sampling rate.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the sampling rate of the output

signals of the mixers (7, 8) is doubled.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the sampling rate is doubled by

the insertion of zeros and subsequent low-pass
filtering.
Circuit arrangement according to either of
Claims 2 and 3, characterized in that a reduction to a

sampling rate which is favourable for further
processing is furthermore effected. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterized in that the mixers (7,

8) carry out a multiplication of the samples of the
output signals of the high-pass sigma-delta converters

(5, 6) alternately by +1 and -1.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterized in that the sampling

rate corresponds to twice the intermediate frequency.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding Claims, characterized in that first-order

high-pass sigma-delta converters are provided.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims
1 to 6, characterized in that second-order high-pass

sigma-delta converters are provided.
