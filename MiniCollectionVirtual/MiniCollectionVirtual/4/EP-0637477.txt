<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a supplying system for continuous aluminium-casting systems, comprising a channel, a feed nozzle (2) which is inserted into the channel (1) and into which a plug (3) for regulating the melt inlet (4) is inserted, the plug (3) closing the melt inlet at the narrowest point of the feed nozzle (2), and furthermore optionally comprising a control system by means of which the depth of insertion of the plug can be controlled within specified limits. A distance A of at least 7 cm should be maintained between the narrowest point of the nozzle and the inlet and outlet of the latter, the space between the nozzle (2) and the plug (3) at the nozzle inlet being narrowed to a length B and a minimum distance of 2 cm remaining from the tip S of the plug to the nozzle outlet Y during operation.

<CLAIMS>
A supplying system for continuous aluminium casting
plants, consisting of a launder, an inlet nozzle (2)

which is inserted into the launder (1) and into which

there is inserted a plug (3) for regulating the melt
inlet (4), with the plug (3) closing the melt inlet at

the narrowest cross-section of the inlet nozzle (2), and
furthermore consisting of a control system by means of

which the immersion depth of the plug is controllable
within predetermined limits,

characterised in

that from the narrowest cross-section of the nozzle (2)
to the nozzle entry (X) and nozzle exit (Y), a distance

(A
1
, A
2
) of at least 7 cm is observed, and that at the
nozzle entry, the space between the nozzle (2) and the

plug (3) is narrowed along a length B which ranges from
greater 0 to 10 cm.
A suppling system according to claim 1,

characterised in

that narrowing takes place along a length of 1 - 10 cm.
A supplying system according to any one of the
preceding claims,

characterised in

that above the narrowest nozzle cross-section between
the nozzle (2) and the plug (3), there is formed an

annular space D which becomes narrower in the direction 
of flow, whereas below the narrowest nozzle

cross-section, the space between the nozzle (2) and the
plug (3) is widened by an opening angle of at least 4°,

with the plug point S being rounded with a radius of 10 -
14 mm.
A supplying system according to any one of the
preceding claims,

characterised in

that the edges at the entry and exit are rounded with
a radius of 5 - 25 mm.
A supplying system according to any one of the
preceding claims,

characterised in

that the annular space D is formed by an annular gap
between the nozzle (2) and the plug (3), with the side

walls forming the annular gap extending nearly parallel
relative to one another.
A supplying system according to claim 5,

characterised in

that the nearly parallel side walls of the annular space
D become narrower in the direction of flow with a

difference in angles of approximately 1°.
A method of regulating a supplying system for
continuous aluminium casting plants according to any one

of the preceding claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in


that there are set a metal level H in the launder (1)
of at least 5 cm above the nozzle entry X and an

immersion depth T of the nozzle (2) of least 2 cm.
