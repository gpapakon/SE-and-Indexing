<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substituted porphyrins and
to techniques and intermediates useful in preparing
substituted porphyrins. The invention also relates to
uses for the porphyrins.Porphyrins are derivatives of porphine, a conjugated
cyclic structure of four pyrrole rings linked through their
2- and 5-positions by methine bridges. Porphyrins can be
covalently attached to other molecules. The electronic
features of the porphyrin ring system can be altered by the
attachment of one or more substituents. The term "porphyrin"
includes derivatives wherein a metal atom is inserted into the
ring system, as well as molecular systems in which ligands are
attached to the metal. The substituents, as well as the
overall porphyrin structure, can be neutral, positively
charged, or negatively charged. Numerous porphyrins have been isolated from natural sources. Notable porphyrin-containing
natural products include hemoglobin, the chlorophylls, and vitamin B12. Also,
many porphyrins have been synthesized in the laboratory, typically through condensation
of suitably substituted pyrroles and aldehydes. However, reactions of this type generally
proceed in low yield, and cannot be used to produce many types of substituted porphyrins.Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for synthetic methods capable of
producing a greater variety of porphyrins than presently available.It is one object of the present invention to provide improved methods for
synthesizing substituted porphyrins.It is another object of the invention to provide novel substituted porphyrins.It is yet another object to provide novel porphyrin-containing compounds.It is still another object to provide new applications for substituted porphyrins and
porphyrin-containing compounds.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process as
set out in claim 1 for derivatizing a porphyrin. Preferred features of the process according
to the first aspect of the present invention are set out in dependent claims 2 to 7 and 9 to
24.According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound
having formula (1), (2), or (3) as set out in claim 25. Preferred features of the compound
according to the second aspect of the present invention are set out in dependent claims 26
to 63. The present invention also provides a supported catalyst composition comprising a
compound according to claim 25 on a solid support material.The present invention further provides a compound as set out in claim 8.According to a further aspect of
