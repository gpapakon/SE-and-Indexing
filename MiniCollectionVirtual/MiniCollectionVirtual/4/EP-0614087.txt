<ABSTRACT>
Four piezoelecric elements (14a-d) are formed on both surfaces 
of plate-shaped vibrating body (10). Two piezoelectric elements (14a,b) 

are formed to be opposite to each other at one side of 
the longitudinal center portion of the vibrating body. 

Another two piezoelectric elements (14c,d) are formed to be opposite 
to each other at the other side of the longitudinal center 

portion of the vibrating body. By applying the signal to the 
piezoelectric elements, the vibrating body is vibrated in a 

longitudinal direction, such that expansion takes place in one part and 
contraction takes place simultaneously in another part of the 

vibrating body. By using such vibration, the 
ends are not displaced in spite of the vibration 

of the vibrating body. An acceleration senser is obtained by 
measuring the output voltages from the piezoelectric 

elements of the vibrating body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric
vibrator and an acceleration sensor, particularly, relates
to a piezoelectric vibrator used for oscillator, filter and
sensor, and relates to an acceleration sensor using the
piezoelectric vibrator.As a piezoelectric vibrator using the piezoelectric
effect, there is the piezoelectric vibrator which a
piezoelectric element is formed on a surface of a vibrating
body formed of constant elastic metal material and the like.
As a vibrating mode of such piezoelectric vibrator, there
are bending vibrating mode, thickness vibrating mode,
twisting vibrating mode and longitudinal vibrating mode and
the like. The piezoelectric vibrator is used for oscillator,
filter and sensor and the like.In the conventional piezoelectric vibrator, it becomes
difficult to support the piezoelectric vibrator according 
to the miniaturization. Vibration tends to leak through the
supporting portion of the piezoelectric vibrator, and the
characteristics of the piezoelectric vibrator is
deteriorated due to the vibration leakage. When some
displacement or deformation occur to the supporting portions
of the piezoelectric vibrator by the external force, the
characteristics of the piezoelectric vibrator varies
largely.Fig. 57 is an illustrative view showing an example of a
conventional acceleration sensor. The acceleration sensor 1
includes a plate 2. One end of the plate 2 is fixed, and a
weight 3 is attached to the other end of the plate 2. A
piezoelectric elements 4 are formed on both surfaces of the
plate 2.When an acceleration is applied in a direction
perpendicular to the surface of the plate 2 of the
acceleration sensor 1, the plate 2 bends as shown in
Fig. 58. A voltage corresponding to the bending of plate 2
is generated in the piezoelectric elements 4. By measuring
the voltage correspoonding to the bending of plate 2, the
acceleration can be detected. The bending of the plate 2
can be increased by attaching the weight 3, and resulting in
improvement of the sensitivity of the acceleration sensor 1.When such an acceleration sensor is mounted on a car,
the impact or the vibration due to unevenness of the road is 
often stronger than the acceleration of the car. Hence,
such an acceleration sensor of cantilever-construction type
is apt to cause misoperation or damage due to influence of
impact attributable to unevenness of the road surface.It is necessary to use a plurality of acceleration
sensors in order to detect accelerations in a plurality of
directions. US-A-4,633,204 relates to a
