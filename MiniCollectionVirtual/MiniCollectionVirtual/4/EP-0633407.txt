<ABSTRACT>
An improved one-way clutch (10) includes an 
outer race (16) having an annular inner surface (22), an 

inner race (14) having an annular outer surface (20) 
disposed coaxially with the outer race (16), a plurality 

of sprags (18) spaced circumferentially between the 
inner surface (22) and outer surface (20), a sprag 

holder (12) for holding the sprags (18) in an annular 
space between the annular surfaces (20,22) and a 

plurality of inertia resistance members (30) having an 
arcuately conforming engagement surface (36) mounted 

about the sprag holder (12), the arcuately conforming 
engagement surface (36) being in engagement with one of 

the said inner surface (22) and outer surface (20) to 
provide torque or inertia resistant drag between the 

sprag holder (12) and one of the inner and outer 
surfaces (20,22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to one-way clutches 
having tiltable sprags disposed between concentric races 
for controlling torque delivery in a torque flow path 
between a driving member and a driven member. Conventional sprag type clutches contain inner 
and outer concentric races, a plurality of sprags 
disposed between the races and a holder sometimes 
referred to as a cage for mounting the sprags. In 
clutches such as shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,824,635 and 
4,998,605, the holder is of one piece construction and 
the sprags are mounted in the plurality of aligned 
openings or windows around the holder. In other 
clutches such as shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,875,564 and 
4,875,364, inner and outer concentric annular rings 
define the holder and likewise mount the sprags therein. 
In both types of clutches, the sprags are tiltable to 
engage and disengage the concentric clutch races. The 
sprags tilt to engage and lock the clutch when moving in 
one direction of rotation and tilt to disengage and 
allow overrunning of the clutch when moving in the 
opposite direction. In such clutches a frictional force imparting 
member usually referred to as an inertia resistance or 
drag member is sometimes provided between the holder and 
the driving race to more reliably transmit to the sprags  
 
the movement of the driving race when it is suddenly 
accelerated or decelerated or rotates at high speed. U.S. Patent No. 4,635,770 discloses a one-way 
clutch having a holder defined by inner and outer 
parallel annular band portions. A part of one of the 
annular band portions defined as a connecting portion is 
cut and bent so as to have a planar portion which bears 
against one of the race surfaces thereby forming the 
frictional force imparting member. U.S. Patent No. 5,024,308 discloses a one-way 
clutch wherein the axial end of the holder has been 
modified by means of a lancing and bending operation to 
form a radially protruding curved portion defining the 
frictional force imparting member which generates 
dragging torque between the holder and one of the clutch 
races. Other designs for inertia resistance or drag 
members in a one-way clutch include the use of drag 
clips which are comprised of metal spring-type elements 
having a planar frictional engagement surface. These 
clips are mounted on the holder in aligned openings or 
windows around the holder to provide a dragging torque 
between the holder and the outer clutch race. The 
engagement surface of these drag members is often planar 
and non-conforming to
