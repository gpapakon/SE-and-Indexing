<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR PRODUCTION OF PURIFIED SOLUBLE TYPE B AND TYPE A HUMAN PLATELET-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR FRAGMENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to methods for producing soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor fragments. More particularly, it provides cell lines and methods using those cell lines, allowing for highly efficient production of purified platelet-derived growth factor receptor soluble fragments exhibiting ligand binding functions.Polypeptide growth factors are mitogens that act upon cells by specifically binding to receptors located on the cell plasma membrane. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates a diverse group of biochemical responses, e.g., changes in ion fluxes, activation of various inases, alteration of cell shape, transcription of various genes, and modulation of enzymatic activities associated with phospholipid metabolism. See, e.g., Bell et al. (1989) Circulation Research 65:1075-1065. The platelet-derived growth factor is a polypeptide factor which interacts with a membrane bound receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) . The receptor has a binding site which binds the PDGF ligands. Particular medical conditions result from abnormal receptor-ligand interactions. The specificity of binding allows the use of one binding partner to determine, qualitatively or quantitatively, the presence of the other, and to detect abnormal interactions. These diagnostic reagents would be useful.Receptors for platelet-derived growth factor have been expressed in various cells. See, e.g., Orchansky et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:15159-15165; Duan et al. (1991) ___. Biol. Chem. 266:413-418; Heidaran et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:18741-18744; Claesson-Welsh et al. (1988) Mol. and Cell. Biol. 8:3476-3486; and Escobedo et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:1482-1487. 

 Although others have reported expressing PDGF receptors or fragments thereof in cells, the ligand binding fragments have all been of approximately intact extracellular regions of the receptor. In many instances, a smaller and soluble ligand binding segment would be useful. For example, a soluble ligand binding fragment may serve as an antagonist to modulate the effect of PDGF ligands. Antagonists which are soluble and smaller than the original receptor will be useful. The physiological bioavailability of small soluble antagonists will be better than the natural intact receptor. The intact receptor is a membrane bound protein and would typically not
