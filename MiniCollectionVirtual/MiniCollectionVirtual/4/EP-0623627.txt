<ABSTRACT>
Since sulfonamide derivatives of the present 
invention show strong inhibitory activity against cysteine 

protease such as calpain papain, cathepsin B, cathepsin H, 
cathepsin L, they can be used as remedies for muscular 

dystrophy, cataract, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophia, osteoporosis, 

hypercalcemia or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
sulfonamide derivative. More particularly, it relates to a 
novel sulfonamide derivative or a salt thereof which shows 
a strong inhibitory activity against cysteine protease such 
as calpain, cathepsin B, cathepsin H, cathepsin L, papain. As in vivo action of cysteine protease, which 
papain, calpain, cathepsin and the like belong to, has been 
elucidated, its abnormal accentuation has been found to 
cause various diseases. Accordingly, cysteine protease 
inhibitors have been used as remedies for such diseases. 
For example, calpain inhibitors have been reported to be 
effective for animal model suffering from muscular 
dystrophy, cataract, myocardial infarction, stroke, while 
cathepsin inhibitors have been reported to be effective for 
metastasis of cancer, amyotrophia, osteoporosis, 
hypercalcemia and the like. As cysteine protease inhibitors, peptidyl 
aldehyde derivatives are well known. For example, 
Leupeptin [Journal of Antibiotics, 22, 183 (1969)], 
Strepin P-1 [Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, 49, 
799 (1985)], Staccopins P1, P2 [Agricultural and Biological 
Chemistry, 51, 861 (1987)] and the like have been isolated 
from a microbial culture medium. In addition, various 
compounds have been synthesized. For example, MDL 28170 
[Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 157,  
 
1,117 (1988)] and Calpeptin [Journal of Enzyme Inhibition, 
3, 195 (1990)] are well known. Under the present 
conditions, most of the N-termini of these peptidyl 
aldehyde derivatives are free amino acid or amide 
derivative thereof or carbamate thereof, and few have been 
reported about N-terminal in the form of sulfonamide 
[Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 268145-1990; 
Journal of Antibiotics, 41, 220 (1988); Journal of 
Biochemistry, 98, 975 (1985); Developmental Biology, 105, 
246 (1984); Journal of Pharmacobio-Dynamics, 6, 643 (1983);

Proceedings of National Academy of Science of the U.S.A., 
76, 1,131 (1979); Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 137951-1975]. The compounds having stronger cysteine 
protease inhibitory activity have been expected. The present inventors have studied on compounds 
having strong cysteine protease inhibitory activity, and 
have attained the present invention. That is, the point of the present invention is 
sulfonamide derivatives of the following general formula
