<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses a method for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune diseases, allergic or atopic disorders and graft rejection. Specifically, it provides a means of killing a specific subpopulation of T lymphocytes while leaving the majority of other T lymphocytes in the population unaffected. The subpopulation of T lymphocytes are killed by repeatedly challenging the population with an antigen in conjuction with administration of interleukin-4.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment and 
prevention of diseases that are primarily due to T cell immune 
responses. In particular, it relates to the suppression or 
elimination of certain autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, 
and allergic disorders by treatment with interleukin-4 (IL-4) 
and the specific antigen involved, thus allowing the killing 
of only the subpopulation of T cells that recognizes this 
specific antigen. In this manner, IL-4 pretreatment 
sensitizes T cells to undergo programmed cell death following 
T cell receptor engagement. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that 
occurs in many biological systems (1-5). An apoptotic cell 
undergoes a specific program of events dependent upon active 
metabolism that contributes to its own self-destruction. 
Distinct morphological changes occur during this process such 
as membrane blobbing and cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation. 
These changes are accompanied by fragmentation of genomic DNA 
into pieces constituting one to several nucleosomes. In the 
final stages, the cell disintegrates into apoptotic bodies 
that are specifically recognized and phagocytozed by 
neighboring cells. T lymphocytes are sensitive to apoptotic cell death 
induced by a variety of stimuli at multiple points in their 
lifespan. Experimental evidence strongly suggests that 
programmed cell death normally plays a large role in shaping 
and maintaining the T cell repertoire. Repertoire here is  
 
defined by the number of distinct antigen receptor 
specificities contained in the entire pool of T lymphocytes in 
the organism. Each T lymphocyte bears surface receptors for 
antigen that are all of identical structure on that cell and 
therefore are said to represent a single antigen specificity. 
Since each T cell has a unique specificity, the total 
collection of antigen specificities in an organism is the sum 
of different individual T cells, thus the T cell repertoire. 
By eliminating or expanding the number of individual T cells, 
the responsiveness of an organism to a particular antigen can 
be either curtailed or enhanced, respectively. These changes 
have been documented to occur and are known as changes in the 
T cell repertoire. Alterations in the T cell repertoire occur 
naturally during T cell development such that only a small 
fraction of thymocytes (or immature T cells) survive the 
intrathymic development and selection events that allow 
emigration of developing T cells to the peripheral circulation 
(6,7). The majority of thymocytes
