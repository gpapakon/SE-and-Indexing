<ABSTRACT>
A programmable time-intervals generator comprising first 
and second digital counters, a memory, a digital divider 

and a digital adder. On the occurrence of a first event, 
the first counter starts counting, and on the occurrence of 

a second event, only the most significant bits of the 
number counted up to then are stored, thereby providing a 

division by truncation. 
From the stored number, at least two discrete fractions are 
obtained by the divider, whereafter said fractions are 

summed at the adder which operates on strings of bits. 
The second counter counts down the sum number and, on 
becoming cleared, generates a signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to time-intervals generator devices, 
in particular to programmable generators of the digital 
type suitable for monolithic integration. Such programmable time-intervals generators are useful in a 
variety of applications, e.g. to generate delays in digital 
systems for DC controlling three-phase brushless motors 
incorporating no position sensors, referred to in the 
pertinent technical literature as DC brushless sensorless 
motors. Alternatively, generators of this kind may be used 
to directly generate signal-timing signals at predetermined 
time spacings, or control signals. In all cases, time intervals ought to be generated with 
programmable duration, from a basic time interval (i.e. a 
counted coded number for clock periods) which separates two 
discrete events that may be of the same type. In conventional time-intervals generation systems of the 
digital type, said time interval between two events is 
divided into a predetermined number of identical time 
subintervals, and in order to arrive at the programmed time 
spacing, the duration of one such time subinterval is 
multiplied a predetermined number of times. It has been common practice to use for this operation a 
digital counter with base 2, e.g. sixteen-bit, which is 
cleared on the occurrence of an event and begins counting 
at a rate which is set by a clock signal. A second event, which may obviously be of the the same type 
as the first, will enable a memory to store some of the 
most significant bits of the coded number by the counter, 
e.g. the first eleven bits, thereby performing a truncation 
operation, in this case on the least significant five bits,  
 
which is the equivalent of dividing the counted number. 
Specifically in this example, the division is by 2 to a 
power of 5, namely by 32. A decremental counter or down-counter then begins to count 
down the resultant coded number, and an additional counter 
is programmed to count the number of times that the down-counter 
must count the coded number. Thus, a time interval 
is obtained which is equal to the coded number count time 
multiplied a predetermined number of times. However, this scheme has a drawback which may become 
serious in certain applications. To improve the programmability of the actual durations of 
the time spacings generated and their accuracy, the time 
interval must be divided between the two control events 
into increasingly "finer", and hence more numerous, 
subintervals. The consequent overall error, however, may even exceed in 
som
