<ABSTRACT>
A musical data inputting apparatus (11) comprising a 
touch panel (6) for receiving a hand-writing operation 

thereon detects a figure and/or a symbol drawn on the touch 
panel (6) by the hand-writing operation, and further 

recognizes intensity of depression or the number of 
depressions applied on the touch panel (6) by the hand-writing 

operation. The apparatus (11) recognizes musical 
data such as pitches and lengths of notes, a tonality 

and/or a time of a music based on the detected figure and 
symbol and the recognized intensity and number of 

depressions of the hand writing operation. Musical data 
can be input without precisely writing the whole of the 

musical data themselves on the touch panel (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an apparatus for inputting musical data and a method of inputting
musical data into a musical data inputting apparatus.From EP-A-0 057 335 an electronic musical instrument is known which gives a real-time
performance in response to a fingers touch on a musical score sheet. According to the
disclosure, when a musical score sheet placed on a touch panel is sequentially pushed,
or followed by finger in accordance with signs described on the musical score sheet, a
musical sound of a pitch depending on the pushed position in the vertical direction is
generated during the fingers pushing operation. The aim of this apparatus is to support
the exercise of a newcomer who wants to learn to play music.From US-A-4,866,646 a data input apparatus is known, having a pressure-sensitive
tablet, a character recognition section for recognising hand-written character data input
through the tablet, a document memory for sequentially storing a recognition result of the
character data and a power supply. During an input operation the input document data is
stored in the document memory. In summary, the apparatus is designed for character
recognition to enable a reliable memorization of word information. Conventionally has been proposed a music data
inputting apparatus, which is disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai-Hei 4-161990. In that
conventional musical data inputting apparatus, a staff is
displayed on a display panel, and notes are manually
written on the displayed staff, thereby the notes being
input. Pitches and lengths of musical notes input in this
manner are confirmed, and corresponding pitches and lengths
of musical notes are indicated on the staff displayed on
the display unit.In the conventional musical data inputting apparatus,
however, a user or a musician has to precisely hand-write a
figure of a musical note to input and indicate them on the
display unit. When writing a music, the musician is still
required to perform the same operation as writing a music
on a conventional sheet of staff. Therefore, the
conventional musical data inputting apparatus can not
relieve the musician of troublesome work in writing a
music. To make a pitch of a hand-writing musical note to
be recognized with certainty, a musical note has to be
written precisely between lines or on a line of the staff.
Therefore, the conventional apparatus can not free the
musician from hardness in writing a music on the sheet of
staff.Since the conventional musical data inputting
apparatus recognizes
