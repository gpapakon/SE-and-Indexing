<ABSTRACT>
The present system (12) reduces the formation of NOx within the combustion zone by controlling the air/fuel ratio and more explicitly by controlling the air portion of the air/fuel ratio. The present system (12) includes a system (560) for directing a portion of the flow of compressed air exiting a compressor section (22) into an injection nozzle (66, 190, 430) and a device (598) for controllably varying the quantity of compressed air directed into the injection nozzle (66, 190, 430) and into the combustor (40). The system (12) monitors an engine (10) parameter, such as a power turbine (30) inlet gas temperature, sends a signal to a computer (614) which interprets the signal and directs a second signal to a power cylinder (620) which causes a throttling mechanism (588) to move between an open position (596) and a closed position (594) varying the flow rate of compressor air to the combustor (40) depending on the temperature of the gases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system 
for automatically maintaining gas turbine nitrogen 
oxide (NOx) emissions at a specific level in parts per 
million by volume during all ambient conditions for no 
load to full load operating parameters. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a system for 
controlling the combustible air directed to the 
injection nozzle to be mixed with the fuel to control 
the air to fuel ratio. The use of fossil fuel as the combustible 
fuel in gas turbine engines results in the combustion 
products of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water 
vapor, smoke and particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, 
nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxides. Of these above 
products, carbon dioxide and water vapor are 
considered normal and unobjectionable. In most 
applications, governmental imposed regulation have and 
are further restricting the amount of pollutants being 
emitted in the exhaust gases. In the past the majority of the products of 
combustion have been controlled by design 
modifications. For example, smoke is normally 
controlled by design modifications in the combustor, 
particulates are normally controlled by traps and 
filters, and sulfur oxides are normally controlled by 
the selection of fuels being low in total sulfur. 
This leaves carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides as the emissions of primary concern in  
 
the exhaust gases being emitted from the gas turbine 
engine. It is believed that such oxides are produced 
by the direct combination of atmospheric nitrogen and 
oxygen at the high temperatures occurring in the 
combustion zone. The presence of organic nitrogen in 
the fuel may also aid in the production of nitrogen 
oxides together with the atmospheric nitrogen. The 
rates with which nitrogen oxides form depend upon the 
flame temperature and, consequently, a small reduction 
in flame temperature will result in a large reduction 
in the nitrogen oxides. Past and some present systems suggested 
means for reducing the maximum temperature in the 
combustion zone of a gas turbine combustor have 
included schemes for introducing more air at the 
combustion zone, recirculating cooled exhaust products 
into the combustion zone and injecting water spray 
into the combustion zone. An example of such a system 
is disclosed in US-A-4,733,527. The method and 
apparatus disclosed therein automatically maintains 
the NOx emissions at a substantially constant level 
during all ambient conditions and for no load to full 
load fuel flows. The water/fuel ratio
