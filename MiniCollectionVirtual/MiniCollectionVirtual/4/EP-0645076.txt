<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a field chopper for cereal crops, especially for silo maize, which possesses, in the working space of a chopper housing, a rotating chopping member (1) having a number of chopping knives (2). The cutters (5,5') of the chopping knives (2) cooperate with a stationary countercutter (4). The field chopper is to be developed further to the effect that the efficiency of the grain comminution is improved. For this purpose, each chopping knife (2) has a wedge surface (6) adjoining the cutter (5,5') and facing the crop, a profiling (7) being provided on this wedge surface (6).

<CLAIMS>
A forage harvester for grain-bearing crops, particularly for
silo maize and of which the chopping member (1), rotating in

the working space (10) of a chopper housing, is provided
with a number of chopper-cutters (2) which have in their

part which is in front in the direction of rotation a
cutting edge (5) with an exposed surface (5') and, adjacent

thereto and directed towards the crops, a profiled wedge-shaped
surface (6) and with a fixed counter-cutter (4),

characterised in that each chopper-cutter (2) is so designed
that its wedge-shaped surface (6) is provided with an

oblique serrated profiling (7) disposed at an acute angle
(α) to a line perpendicular to the cutting edge (5).
A forage harvester according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the wedge-shaped surface (6) is angled over from the

cutting edge (5, 5') at an acute angle (β).
