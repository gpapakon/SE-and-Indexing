<ABSTRACT>
(epsilon)-Caprolactam is continuously recovered from carpet made from nylon 6 face fibers and a backing. The carpet is fed to a separator to prepare scrap containing nylon 6 and auxiliary materials. The scrap from the separator is fed to a depolymerizing reactor to produce an (epsilon)-caprolactam containing distillate and more auxiliary materials. The (epsilon)-caprolactam in the distillate is separated from other volatiles and purified. The auxiliary materials are also recovered or re-used.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Reclaiming ε-caprolactam from nylon 6 carpetDescriptionThe present invention relates to a process for reclaiming ε-caprolactam. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for reclaiming ε-caprolactam from nylon 6 carpet.As used herein, the term "auxiliary stream" refers to a stream generated during the recovery of ε-caprolactam which does not contain primarily ε-caprolactam or poly-ε-caprolactam.As landfills continue to reach capacity, raw materials are depleted, and man recognizes that the earth's resources are limited, more and more materials are recycled. Synthetic polymers have long presented problems in recycling due to their often being commingled with other materials and to sometimes apparently irreversible polymerization from which useful raw materials cannot be easily obtained.Certain polyamides, however, are known to be hydrolytically convertible to monomers which can be re-used. Especially in the case of nylon 6, the monomeric starting materials are reclaimed from waste polymer and used in the manufacture of man-made fibers. The literature reveals procedures for reclaiming such monomers and polymers. L.A. Dmitrieva et al., Regeneration of ε-caprolactam from Wastes in the Manufacture of Polycaproamide Fibres and Yarns, Fibre Chemistry, March 1986, pp. 229-241, de- scribes methods for reclaiming polycaprolactam (nylon 6) waste.There are generally two methods for reclaiming nylon 6 waste. The first involves reprocessing the waste nylon 6, for example, via remelting and extrusion, to form useful articles. This concept is demonstrated in U.S. Patent 4,143,001 to Raab et al.The second method involves chemical regeneration through depolym- erization. Processes for depolymerizing solid polyamide waste are known. For example, U.S. Patent 2,343,174 to Edison et al. shows general hydrolytic depolymerization using steam. U.S. Patent 3,988,406 to Nakamura et al. shows the recycling of polyamide waste by thermal depolymerization.Among the polyamides depolymerized for re-use of the monomer is nylon 6. For example, U.S. Patent 4,107,160 to Dicoi et al. describes reclamation of solid nylon 6 waste (generated during 

 the processing of nylon 6) , low molecular weight oligomers and residual monomer from the polycondensation of caprolactam.Other polymers are also recycled. An example of a process for continuously degrading various plastics is provided in U.S. Patent 4,051,212 to Grigat et al. Grigat et al. shows a process for continuously hydrolytically degrading plastics. The hydro- lyzable

 Claims
1. A process for recovering ε-caprolactam from nylon 6 containing carpets, yarn waste, chip waste, extruder slag, contaminated monomeric ε-caprolactam or ε-caprolactam oligomers, comprising:
a) providing a carpet made from nylon 6 fibers and having a backing containing one or more non-nylon 6 materials of polypropylene, jute, latex and fillers, or yarn waste, chip waste, extruder slag, contaminated monomeric ε-caprolactam or ε-caprolactam oligomers to a depolymer¬ izing reactor (20) to produce an ε-caprolactam containing distillate (22) and a first auxiliary stream (23);
b) separating ε-caprolactam in the distillate (22) from other volatiles therein;
and
c) purifying the ε-caprolactam obtained after separating so that the ε-caprolactam is of sufficient purify for reuse as a starting material for nylon 6 intended for use in carpet fiber; and
d) working up the fist auxiliary stream (23) by extruding and then extracting it with water obtaining an extracted residual (152) intended for use as filler material and an aqueous extract (150) .
2. The process of claim 1 providing the carpet made from nylon 6 fibers and having a backing containing one or more non-ny¬ lon 6 materials of polypropylene, jute, latex and fillers to a mechanical separator to prepare scrap containing both ny¬ lon 6 and non-nylon 6 backing materials, and a second auxil¬ iary stream (11) and feeding the scrap from the separator to the depolymerizing reactor (20) .
3. The process of claim 2 wherein the second auxiliary stream (11) is used to form into useful objects.
The process of claim 2, further comprising combining the first and second auxiliary streams prior to said extruding. 


 5. The process of claims 1 to 4 wherein the depolymerization is carried out in the presence of a depolymerization catalyst.
6. The process of claim 5, further comprising recycling the
5 depolymerization catalyst to feed the depolymerization reac¬ tor.
7. The process of claim 5 to 6 wherein the depolymerization catalyst is phosphoric acid.
10
8. The process of claims 1 to 7 further comprising supplying the water for the extraction of the first auxiliary stream (23) from purifying the ε-caprolactam obtained after separating.
15 9. The process of claims 1 to 8 wherein the purifying of ε-caprolactam obtained after separating is carried out by distillation and, optionally, oxidation and/or concentrating before this distillation.
20 10. The process of claims 7 to 9, further comprising using the second auxiliary stream (11) to neutralize unextracted phos¬ phoric acid being present in the extracted residual (152) .
