<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cabinet frame which has two front load-bearing members and two rear load-bearing members, can be closed by wall elements except for the front, and in which structural units can be installed via the open front, holders being fitted, or being capable of being fitted, to the two front load-bearing members, to which holders the structural units can be fastened. A cabinet frame in the case of which the wall elements can be fitted at any desired height in a simple manner and in the case of which structural units can be fitted with a different installation depth such that they end flush with one another either at the front or at the rear, is created in that longitudinal slots for accommodating chamfered edges of wall elements are incorporated in the mutually perpendicular outer sides of the rear load-bearing members, in that the rear load-bearing members have fastening webs, which run parallel to the wall elements are spaced apart, for displaceable (adjustable) U-shaped fastening elements to which the wall elements can be fitted, in that the front load-bearing members have longitudinal slots, for accommodating chamfered edges of side wall elements, on the side outer surfaces, in that the front load-bearing members have fastening webs, which run parallel to these wall elements and are spaced apart from one another, for displaceable (adjustable) U-shaped fastening elements to which these wall elements can be fitted, and in that the front load-bearing members have longitudinal receptacles for the holders on the inner surfaces, which are parallel to the outer surfaces, to which longitudinal receptacles the holders can be fitted such that the depth is adjustable.

with a spacing therebetween, for securing adjustable 
U-shaped securing elements (60), on which these wall 

elements (30) are mountable, and in that the front 
supports (10) have elongate receiving means (15) for the 

holders (50) on the internal faces extending parallel to 
the lateral external faces (14), the holders (50) being 

mountable on said holders so as to be adjustable in 
respect of depth. 
Framework according to claim 1, characterised in

relative to the external side of the support (10,20) in  
 

a direction towards the interior of the framework, is 
disposed on the support (10,20), in that the securing 

web (11,21,22) is offset relative to the bearing web 
(12) in a direction towards the interior of the 

framework, and in that the wall element (30,40) is 
supported with its internal side on the bearing web 

(12). 
Framework according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the bearing web (12) of the support (10,20) is 

offset relative to the external side of the support 
(10,20) by an amount corresponding to the thickness of 

the wall element (30,40). 
Framework according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the bearing web (12) communicates 

with the elongate slot (13,23,24) of the support 
(10,20). 
Framework according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that sealing elements are inserted or 

insertable in the elongate slot (13,23,24) of the 
support (10,20). 
Framework according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that a sealing element is mounted on 

the bearing web (12) or on the internal side of the wall 
element (30,40) facing the bearing web (12). 
Framework according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the securing webs (11,21,22) are 

provided with an undercut and orientated towards one 
another on the front support (10) and on the rear 

support (20).  
 
Framework according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the securing element (60) has two 

legs (63,64), which extend parallel to each other with a
