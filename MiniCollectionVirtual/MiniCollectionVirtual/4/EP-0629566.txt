<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a slat conveyor in which the 
extension of the pitch due to the wear of a chain can be easily 

adjusted without performing the construction work which has 
been made on the frame side conventionally. In the conveyor (1), 

slat supporting members (4) support slats (5) adjacent to one another 
in a travelling direction; each of the slat supporting members (4) 

is provided with a first connection portion (20) and a second 
connection portion (18) for connecting the adjacent slat supporting 

members (4); the second connection portion (18) of a succeeding slat 
supporting member (4) overlaps with the first connection portion (20) of 

a preceding slat supporting member (4); coupling shafts (23) are 
provided each of which is provided with a first shaft portion (25) 

engaged with said first connection portion (20) and a second shaft 
portion (24) engaged with said second connection portion (18); the first 

shaft portion (25) and the second shaft portion (24) are made eccentric 
from each other on two axes in parallel; and the coupling shaft (23) 

serves to adjust the interval between the adjacent slats (5) by 
rotation of its attaching position freely and joins the slat 

supporting members (4) endlessly into chain (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a slat conveyor, and 
more particularly to a slat conveyor used to deliver or 
classify articles or baggage in an air port, delivery center, 
etc. Traditionally, a slat conveyor, which can be used 
regardless of articles to be conveyed, has been used in several 
fields. The slat conveyor has several kinds of formats. An example of the slat conveyor will be explained 
below. In many cases, as shown in Fig. 5, in order to convey 
an article to a predetermined position, frames 40 are fixed on 
a floor by an anchor bolt to form a conveying path 41 having a 
path bent as necessity requires. An endless chain 42 is 
mounted on the center line of the conveying path 41. On the 
chain 42, a large number of slat supporting members 43 as shown 
in Fig. 6 (A-A section in Fig. 5) are attached, and on the slat 
supporting members 43, square slats 44 made of synthetic rubber 
are attached. The above chain 42 is formed endlessly and rotatably in 
such a manner that a set of chain links 45 arranged on right 
and left sides (face and back of the drawing) and a set of 
chain links 46 arranged on the upper and lower sides are  
 
alternately combined and cross-shape shafts 47 are arranged at 
points where the chain links 45 and the chain links 46 are 
connected. A roller 48 is rotatably provided on the axis of 
each of the shafts 47 extended vertically, and is adapted to 
rolls along a guide (not shown) provided at the position where 
the chain 42 is mounted on the center portion of the frames 40. A roller 49 is also rotatably provided on the axis of 
each of the shafts 47 (face and back sides of the drawing), and 
is adapted to rotate along the guide (not shown) provided on 
the frames 40. The chain 42 is moved along the conveying path 
41 by a driving device (not shown). The slat supporting 
member 43 is attached to each chain link through a bolt member 
50. The slats 44 attached on the slat supporting members 43 
are so configured that on the lower side of tail end of a 
certain slat, the upper surface of the front end of a 
succeeding slat is superposed in a direction of the travelling 
direction of the slat supporting members 43 so that the article 
placed on the slat 44 can be smoothly conveyed without dropping 
the article from the conveying path 41. However, the conventional slat conveyor having the 
above arrangement has the following problem. The use for a 
long time gives rise to extension or stretch of the chain owing 
to the wear of the shafts of connecting the chain links. This

<CLAIMS>
A slat conveyor comprising: 
   slats arranged adjacent to one another to constitute an 

article conveying surface along a conveying path defined by 
frames; 

   slat supporting members supporting respective slats and 
movable in a travelling direction in said conveying path, each 

of said slats having a first open connection portion located in 
a first end thereof and a second open connection portion 

located in a second end thereof opposite from said first end in 
said conveying path; and 

   at least one coupling shaft having a first shaft 
portion and a second shaft portion eccentric with respect to 

said first shaft portion, 
   wherein said first and second connection portions of 

adjacent pair of said slat supporting members are respectively 

engaged with said first and second shaft portions to couple 
said adjacent pair, and said first shaft portion is located in 

one of a first position wherein said first shaft portion is 
displaced relative to said second shaft portion in said 

travelling direction and a second position wherein said first 
shaft portion is displaced relative to said second shaft 

portion in a direction opposite to said travelling direction to 
selectively vary a distance between said adjacent pair. 
The slat conveyor according to claim 1, wherein 
said first and second shaft portions are rotatable with respect 

 
to said first and second connection portions of said adjacent 

pair while remaining engaged therewith. 
The slat conveyor according to claim 2, further 
comprising: 

   means for preventing removal of said coupling shaft 
from said adjacent pair and relative rotation between said 

first shaft portion and said first connection portion. 
The slat conveyor according to claim 3, wherein 
said means for preventing includes a disk member fixed on an 

axial end of said first shaft portion and having a diameter 
larger than that of an opening of said first connection 

portion; and a fixing member for fixing said disk member to 
said first connection portions to prevent relative rotation 

between said first shaft portion and said first connection 
portion. 
The slat conveyor according to claim 1, wherein 
said first and second connection portions are overlapped with 

each other when they are coupled through said coupling shaft. 
The slat conveyor according to claim 1, wherein 
some of adjacent pairs of said slat supporting members are 

coupled through a cylindrical shaft, and the other pairs 
thereof are coupled through said coupling shafts.
