<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for speed control of a compressor, particularly a refrigeration compressor, and a control arrangement using this method. The speed control is effected in that a control arrangement varies the speed of an electric motor in dependence of simple ON/OFF signals from a thermostat placed in the surroundings to be cooled. The method according to the invention is characterised in that the starting speed of the compressor in a following ON period is reduced in relation to the final speed in the previous ON period. A continuous reduction of the starting speed of each ON period results in a self-regulating control giving long compressor operation times and an averagely low speed resulting in energy savings. A control arrangement using this method is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for speed control of a
compressor, particularly a refrigeration compressor, and a
control arrangement using this method. The speed control is
effected in that a control arrangement varies the speed of
an electric motor in dependence of simple ON/OFF signals
from a thermostat placed in the surroundings to be cooled.The task on which the application is based, is the development
of a control method and a control arrangement for a
variable speed compressor, which is simple compared with
the state of the art, and which can be fitted into existing
constructions, e.g. refrigerators, which normally operated
at fixed speed, but which can be changed to operation with
variable speed by a quick intervention of a service technician.
It is known to control the speed of compressors in
dependence of the pressure conditions in the refrigeration
system or in dependence of electronic temperature signals,
but a common feature of these solutions is that they require
relatively expensive pressure and temperature meters,
and can only in rare cases directly replace existing solutions.US 5,410,230 describes a compressor control with an ON/OFF
thermostat controlling the motor speed on the basis of the
cyclic parameter, i.e. the duty cycle. The ON and OFF times
of the thermostat are measured, and the duty cycle is calculated.
If the duty cycle is lower than a predetermined
value, the starting speed in the next cycle is reduced, and
if it is higher, the starting speed is increased. When the
thermostat is closed and the compressor operates, the motor
speed is ramped upwards during the ON period, and correspondingly 
the motor speed is ramped downwards during the
OFF period of the thermostat.The control described in US 5,410,230 is developed with a
view to sawing a control component, e.g. a temperature
controlling microprocessor, and in stead of having a price
increasing component like a microprocessor measure and
treat a temperature signal from an electronic thermostat,
US 5,410,230 uses a cheaper solution with an ON/OFF thermostat.
However, the control method described is relatively
complicated, as both ON and OFF times are measured, and at
least three speed calculations are made during an ON/OFF
cycle, viz. a first calculation of the starting speed, then
a second continuous calculation of the speed in the ON
period and a third calculation of the speed in the OFF
period. Besides, the described method involving speed control
during both the ON and the OFF period causes a relatively
large energy

Method for controlling the motor speed in a compressor
unit using an electronic control arrangement, which,

from a thermostat with the states ON or OFF, receives a
signal depending on the temperature in the room to be

cooled, and where in each ON period the control arrangement
starts the motor at a starting speed and

increases the motor speed to a final speed during an ON period;
the starting speed in a following

ON period (P2,Fig.2 and Fig.3) being reduced in
relation to the final speed in a previous ON period

(P1) 
characterised by
 making the control arrangement (11) subtract a
predetermined speed from the final speed in the previous

ON period and letting the result of this calculation
be the starting speed in the following ON period

(P2) through which the speed is either increased or
kept constant.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
control arrangement stores the final speed from the

previous ON period (P1) in a memory and measures the
compressor speed during an actual ON period, deciding

on the basis of a comparison of these two speeds, what
the speed has to be in the actual or the following ON

period.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
predetermined speed subtracted has a constant value, so

that the starting speed in a following ON period (P3,
Fig.2) is lower than the starting speed in an actual ON

period (P2,Fig.2), if the thermostat delivers an OFF
signal before the actual compressor speed is equal to 

the final speed in a previous ON period (P1, Fig.2).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
speed during an ON period (P1, Fig.2) is set at maximum,

if the speed change during this ON period exceeds
a predetermined limit value.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
speed during an ON period (P1, Fig.3) is set at maximum,

if the total operation time exceeds a fixed limit
value.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
speed is increased at a first time t1 and then again at

a second time t2.
Method according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
speed is kept constant at a first speed until the time

t1 (P1,Fig.3), whereafter the speed is raised and kept
constant at a second speed until the time t2, after

which the speed is increased according to a ramp.
Method for speed control of the motor in a compressor
unit by means of an electronic control arrangement receiving

a temperature signal from a thermostat with the
states ON or OFF, and in which the speed determined by

the control arrangement is a function of the duration
of the ON and/or OFF period, 
characterised in that
 the
control arrangement (11) reduces the motor speed, if

the thermostat (2) breaks before a first time t1
(P3,Fig.4), that the motor speed is maintained, if the

thermostat breaks after the first time t1 but before
the second time t2 (P2), and that the motor speed is

increased, if the thermostat has not broken when reaching 
the time t2 (P1).
Method according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the
motor speed is kept constant in the actual ON period

and that the change of the motor speed is effected in
the following ON period.
