<ABSTRACT>
The invention makes use of fluctuations in the quality factor 
(Q) of an oscillation circuit (S) that occur when an object 

comes into the vicinity of an electrode (10) as a means of detecting 
the presence or absence of the object. The invention 

comprises an electrode (10), which is set on the edge of a detection 
field, a supplementary device (20) which, together with 

the electrode (10), forms an oscillation circuit (S), and a Q 

detection device (30), which detects fluctuations in the quality 
factor of the oscillation circuit (S). The object detection 

device of the invention dispenses with the need for a frequency 
detection circuit and this simplifies the overall configuration. 

The device is thus more compact, less expensive and easier to 
use than conventional object detection devices while at the same 

time ensuring detection of the presence or absence of objects in 
the detection field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the improvement of an object 
detection device that detects the presence or absence of an 
object in its detection field. There are well known object detection devices of the type 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying Open Gazette S63-305282, 
said disclosed device comprising a pair of electrodes 
inserted into the floor on either side of a partition wall 
and a supplementary circuit incorporating said electrodes to 
form an oscillation circuit, and designed such that, if a 
person or thing comes within range of said electrodes, there 
is a change in the capacitance of the electrodes and a 
corresponding fluctuation in the oscillation frequency of 
said oscillation circuit. The oscillation frequency is 
compared with a reference frequency to determine the 
presence or otherwise of said person or thing. However, since conventional object detection devices of the  
 
type outlined above use changes in frequency of oscillation 
to determine the presence of an object in the detection 
field, they also need to be fitted with some sort of 
frequency detection circuit such as an F-V converter or an 
FM detector circuit and this makes their circuitry much more 
complex than that required for a device that simply compares 
a voltage or current reading with a predetermined threshold 
value. This in turn makes the conventional type of device 
both expensive and bulky. In addition, the more precise the 
level of detection required, the more sophisticated the 
necessary adjustment procedures become. The present invention has been designed with the above 
points in mind and it is one object of the invention to make 
use of the fluctuations in quality factor Q of an 
oscillation circuit that take place when an object 
approaches an electrode as a means of determining the 
presence or absence of an object in the vicinity of the 
electrode. In order to achieve the above object, the object detection 
device of the present invention comprises an electrode set 
on the edge of a detection field, a supplementary device 
which, together with said electrode, forms an oscillation  
 
circuit, and a Q detection device to detect fluctuations in 
the quality factor of said oscillation circuit. In the above configuration, when an object enters the 
detection field, the oscillation circuit Q fluctuates. This 
fluctuation is detected by the Q detection device and the 
entry of an object into the detection field is thereby 
detected. The object detection device of the present invention thus 
dispenses with the
