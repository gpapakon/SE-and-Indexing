<ABSTRACT>
Telescopic rule for supporting marking lines, consisting of square telescopic tubes, the female part (1) of which is slotted over its length and in one corner in order to allow the manoeuvring form of the male part (2) to fit. Each end is equipped with a synthetic rubber end-piece (3) in which are inserted the hooks (10, 11, 12) supporting the marking line; these have the following particular features:     - of not projecting in relation to the profile of the rule, - of allowing the rule to be used equally well in re-entrant or salient corners, - of leaving a space which receives the marking lines and which is formed by the converging and opposite faces of the end-piece and of the hooks, this convergence ensuring an effective wedging of the marking lines.

<CLAIMS>
A telescopic straight-rule string support composed of a square male part (2) 
which slides and locks into a tubular female part (1), also square; the female part 

(1) being split along its entire length; this slit (6) allows a grip (7) on the male part 
(2) to pass through it, sliding inside the female part (1); the telescopic straight-rule 

being equipped, at each end, with a cap (3), wherein the slit (6) is placed in 
an angle of the female part (1) and wherein metal hooks (10, 11, 12) are inserted 

in the caps (3) made of synthetic rubber to hold a string (16) tight between each 
end of the straight-rule, the said hooks being flush to the profile of the straight-rule. 
A telescopic straight-rule string support, as claimed in claim 1, wherein a grip 
(7) interdependent with the male part (2) and intended to enable and facilitate 

height adjustment of the straight-rule, abuts onto the locking device (4) of the 
female part (1) so as to ensure a minimum insertion of the male part into the 

female part, maintaining perfect rigidity of the telescopic straight-rule when it is 
adjusted to its maximum height. 
A telescopic straight-rule string support, as claimed in claim 1, wherein each 
synthetic rubber cap (3) has three hooks (10, 11, 12) to hold the string tight 

between the ends to the straight-rule to enable it to be used equally for protruding 
or sunken angles. 
A telescopic straight-rule string support, as claimed in claims 1 and 3, wherein 
the caps (3) and the hooks (10, 11, 12) have inclined faces (14, 15) and wherein 

the inclined faces of the hooks (15) are inclined differently from the inclined faces 
(14) of the cap (3) on which the hooks are fitted, these inclinations intersecting to 

enable the stretched string (16) to be held tight between the two ends of the 
straight-rule.
