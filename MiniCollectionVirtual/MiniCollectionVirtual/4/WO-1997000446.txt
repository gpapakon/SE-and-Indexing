<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an immunological test kit and immunoassay using a first immobilized antibody having affinity for a specific antigen. The invention is characterized by a second and third antibody being specific for different determinants of the antigen and modified with cross-linkable oligonucleotides. For detection, the oligonucleotides are amplified, whereby only such oligonucleotides will be amplified which have been cross-linked to each other. In this way unspecific background is avoided and detection is possible down to single molecules.

 IMMUNOASSAY AND KIT WITH TWO REAGENTS THAT ARE CROSS-LINKED IF THEYADHERETOANANALYTETechnical fieldThe present invention relates to ultrasensitive immunoassays. More specifically, it relates to immunological test kits and processes for immunological detection of a specific antigen. In the present invention, the fields of immunology and molecular genetics are combined.Background of the inventionImmunoassays represent powerful tools to identify a very wide range of compounds, such as antigens and antibodies. Examples of immunoassays are ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and RIA (radio immunoassay). Common to all these immunoassays, is that detection sensitivity is limited by the affinity of typical antibodies.With the prior art immunoassays, detection is not possible below a certain number of molecules, because the background, i.e. unspecifically bound material, interferes with the results. Detection of very low numbers of antigen is becoming increasingly important, especially for diagnostic applications. Therefore, further developments in sensitivity as well as specificity of immunological assays are desired.Cantor et al, Science, Vol. 258, 2 Oct. 1992, have previously reported the attachment of oligonucleotides to antibodies in order to permit detection of such antibodies having bound antigen in immune reactions. A streptavidin-protein A chimera that posseses tight and specific binding affinity for both biotin and immunoglobulin G was used to attach biotinylated DNA specifically to antigen-monoclonal antibody complexes that had been immobili¬ zed on microtiter plate wells. Then, a segment of the attached DNA was amplified by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Analysis of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide allowed detection of 580 antigen molecules (9,6 x IO'22 moles) which is a significant improvement compared 

to, for example, conventional ELISA.However, in Cantor et al., the labeled DNA-antibody complexes are assembled in situ during the assay. This can create variable stoichiometry in the assembly of the components and in the attachment of the DNA label. Moreover, extra steps are required for addition of biotinylated reagents and binding proteins. Numerous wash steps are also needed to remove excess reagents and to free assay components of non-specifically bound reagents.Hendrickson et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1995, Vol 23, No.3, report an advancement of the Cantor et al. assay that reduces complexity. This is
