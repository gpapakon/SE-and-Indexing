wings (12) which form a slot (13) in which two elastic tabs 

(15) converge towards the bottom (14), each tab (15) 
blending with a corresponding one of the wings (12) so as 

to form an elbow-shaped portion (16), an electrical 
conductor (20), made of copper or enamelled copper alloy, 

being insertable between the elastic tabs (15) up to their 
free ends, parts (19) of the borders of the tabs (15) being 

sharp, the connector (10) being characterized in that the 
tabs (15) are pre-loaded, so as to push towards each other, 

by raised portions (23, 24), which are formed so as to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector for 
electric connections and to a process for manufacturing 
such connectors. WO-A-88 05 216 discloses a connector as 
defined in the preamble of the appended claim 1 and a 
process for manufacturing electric connectors including the 
combination of process steps as defined in the preamble of 
the appended claim 7. Particular connectors are usually used in electrical 
connections and wirings; these connectors are obtained from 
a laminar element wherein the electric contact elements are 
capable of adequately punching through the insulating 
sheath, if any, of the conductor and of entering it to 
provide contact. One kind of these connectors comprises a laminar body 
made of a conducting metallic material with at least two 
oppositely arranged substantially rigid wings which form, 
between them, a slot in which two elastic electrical 
contact tabs converge towards the bottom; each tab blends 
with one of the wings, forming an elbow. A conductor can be inserted and locked between said 
elastic tabs, forming an electric contact. Some regions of the borders of the tabs are sharp, so 
that during the insertion of the conductor between them the 
insulating sheath thereof is cut and so that said tabs can 
penetrate in the conductor and provide contact with the 
conducting part. The laminar element from which the connector is 
obtained is blanked by means of punches which must of 
course have a certain thickness in order to provide an 
effective cutting action.  
 For this reason, the two tabs are mutually spaced 
during initial blanking and are then moved mutually closer 
so as to move into mutual contact their ends which must 
accommodate the conductor, giving them an elastic pre-loading  
 This is currently achieved by providing a notch for 
each tab in the region where said tabs blend with the outer 
wings and by then forming a raised portion which overlaps 
the notch. However, the notches have the important drawback that 
they weaken the structure exactly in a region where the 
stresses induced by the presence of the conductor once 
installed tend to discharge. While this on one hand makes it impossible for the 
conductor to disengage from said tabs and enter the slot, 
on the other hand it hinders the movements to which the 
tabs are subjected both during the forming of the 
connector, particularly with the pre-loading by forming the 
notch and the raised portion, and during use, when they are 
moved mutually apart by the insertion of the conductor. A
