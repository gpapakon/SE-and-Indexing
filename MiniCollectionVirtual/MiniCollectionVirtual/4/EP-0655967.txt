<ABSTRACT>
A method of compression moulding which comprises providing moulding apparatus including first and second moulding surfaces defining a moulding cavity. At least one moulding surface is movable such that the surfaces are arrangeable at relatively distal and proximal positions with respect to each other. A curable material to be moulded is arranged in the moulding cavity and at least one surface is advanced from the distal to the proximal position. One or more moulding surface is vibrated during closure of the moulding cavity, so as to urge non-cured material into contact with substantially the entire of the moulding surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF VIBRATION-MOULDING AND AN APPARATUS FOR CARRYING OUT THE MOULDINGThe present invention is concerned with moulding, and in particular a moulding technique which assists filling of a mould cavity with a mould material.It is desirable during moulding processes to urge a mould material into the extremities of a mould cavity, so as to produce a moulded article replicating the contours and detail of the cavity. It is however often difficult to achieve the above, particularly so when a viscous thermosetting material commences curing during introduction into the cavity.We have now developed a moulding process and apparatus which help to alleviate the above problem.According to the present invention there is provided a method of compression moulding which comprises:(a) providing moulding apparatus comprising at least first and second moulding surfaces defining a moulding cavity, at least one surface being movable such that said surfaces are arrangeable at relatively distal and proximal positions with respect to each other;(b) arranging a curable material to be moulded in said cavity; and(c) advancing said at least one movable surface from said distal to said proximal position, and concurrently vibrating one or more of said moulding surfaces so as to urge non-cured material into contact with substantially the entire of said moulding surfaces.In addition to promoting filling of the moulding cavity with the thermosetting material, vibration of the moulding surface or surfaces substantially as hereinbefore described is advantageous for reducing the force required to close the cavity.It is preferred that the moulding cavity is defined by opposed first and second surfaces, and the surfaces may be respectively vibrated in opposed directions. The vibration is preferably such as to effect substantially complete filling of the cavity with the mould material. 

 The vibration may involve transverse vibration of at least one moulding surface, so as to urge the thermosetting material to substantially fill the moulding cavity. The vibration may further comprise vibration of the opposed moulding surfaces between relatively proximal and distal arrangements, so as to assist compacting of the material between the surfaces.The transverse vibration of a moulding surface may involve transverse motion in more than one direction. Typically the transverse vibration may involve substantially orthogonal vibratory motion of at least one surface.It is preferred that the material to be moulded comprises a thermosetting resin or
