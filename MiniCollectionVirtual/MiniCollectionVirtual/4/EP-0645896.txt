<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, it is proposed to use the same frequency simultaneously for duplex data transmission between a beacon and a vehicle using the passive transponder method. In order to eliminate reciprocal interference of the transmission signals, the signals are radiated onto different polarisation planes. This offers the advantage that more or less identical antennas can be used for both polarisation planes. Both the beacon and the vehicle can thereby transmit simultaneously. A narrower bandwidth is thus required. More data can also be transmitted.
