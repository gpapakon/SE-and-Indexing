<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical disk having at least two magnetic layers stacked on a 
substrate. The magnetism of both of these magnetic layers exchange coupled at 

temperatures below the curie points of both layers, where primary micro-regions α₀ are 
provided in which the magnetic wall produced between the magnetic layers is canceled 

by the magnetic inversion of the primary magnetic layer, and secondary micro-regions 
α₁ are provided in which the magnetic wall produced between the magnetic layers is 

canceled by the magnetic inversion of the secondary magnetic layer. One of the micro-regions 
is considered the informational unit, and the presence/absence and/or length of 

this informational unit expresses the information stored on the disk. As a result, there 
is no problem of information being lost when the disk is accidentally exposed to an 

excessive magnetic field or when the disk is exposed to abnormally high temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording media and, in particular, to a new 
magneto-optical disk and the method of playback thereof. Recently, great efforts have been made to develop an optical recording and 
playback method, as well as recording equipment, playback equipment and recording 
media to be used according to such a method, wherein a variety of demands will be 
satisfied, including high density and large volume storage, high access speeds, and high 
recording and playback speeds. Among the wide range of optical recording and playback methods presently 
contemplated, the magneto-optical recording and playback method holds the greatest 
promise because of the unique advantage that, after being recorded on the recording 
medium, information can be erased, and it is possible to repeatedly record new 
information on the recording medium many times over. The magneto-optical recording disk (medium) used in this magneto-optical 
recording and playback method has a magnetic film comprising one or multiple layers 
to be the layer that preserves the recording. Originally, when magneto-optical disks 
were first produced, the magnetic film was a horizontally magnetized film (the direction 
of magnetization ran parallel to the film plane). Later, perpendicularly magnetized 
layers, which have high recording densities and high signal strength, were developed. 
Today, this latter type of magneto-optical recording disk, having perpendicularly 
magnetized layers, is used most of the time and the magnetized film is composed of, 
for example, amorphous GdFe and GdCo, GdFeCo, TbFe, TbCo, or TbFeCo, etc. In  
 
general, the magneto-optical recording disk has concentric circular or linear tracks, and 
information is recorded on these tracks. For a description of the related art herein, a first direction of magnetization (the 
"upward" direction) in relation to the film plane shall be defined as the "A direction," 
and a second direction of magnetization, opposite to the first direction of magnetization, 
shall be defined as the "anti-A direction." The information to be recorded on the 
magneto-optical disk has previously been made into binary information, and is recorded 
by two signals, the first being a mark which is magnetized in the "A direction" and 
designated B₁, and the second being a mark that has been magnetized in the "anti-A 
direction" and designated B₀. These two marks B₁ and B₀ are equivalent to the digital 
signals of 1 for one direction and 0 for the other, respectively. However, the 
magnetizing
