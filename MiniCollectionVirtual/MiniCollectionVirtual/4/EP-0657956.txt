<ABSTRACT>
A mast-type antenna assembly for earth mobile stations which communicate 
via a geostationary satellite. The antenna assembly incorporates an 

arrangement 
which permits selective adjustment of the elevation angle of the antenna's 

radiation lobe for optimum gain from any geographic location. 
According to the invention, the assembly comprises a bifilar helix 
(5,6) arranged 

within a radome (12) whose end co-operates with 
screw tracks (17,18) in a 

tubular base member (13) such that by twisting 
the radome the helix is deformed 

and the pitch (p) of the 
helix is changed, thereby changing the elevation angle () of 

the radiation lobe radiating from the antenna.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antenna assembly for transmitting or receiving RF signals of a
given wavelength, said assembly comprising a metal feed tube member having a feed line
for connexion to an RF signal source at one end thereof, and two wire helices of
predetermined length, diameter and pitch arranged co-axially about said feed tube in a
bifilar manner, one end of each helix being coupled to the feed line.In a communication system of the abovementioned kind, there exists a requirement for a
mast style, high gain, circularly polarised omni-directional antenna for each mobile earth
station to allow for operation at all azimuth angles. The need for high gain requires the
antennas elevation pattern to be very directional. The satellite will appear at different
angles above the horizon from mobile earth stations positioned at different geographical
locations, and therefore for maximum antenna gain at an earth mobile station, the major
radiation lobe of the station's antenna should be adjusted to precise elevation angle vis-a-vis
the satellite. Typically, the elevation angle of a geostationary satellite for an Australian
satellite communication system presently in use is 160° E longitude and therefore the
correct angle of elevation for an associated earth station antenna for optimum gain in, for
example Sydney, is 50°, whereas in Perth the correct angle of elevation of the antenna is
30°.Antenna arrangements are known which use an array phasing method for electronically
controlling the elevation angle of the antennas radiation lobe, but this method is complex
and relatively expensive. Further, some known antenna arrangement for satellite
communication, such as a quadrifilar helical antenna have undesirable wide beam low gain
elevation lobe patterns.The earlier, late published patent application WO 94/27338 describes a steerable beam
helix antenna for transmitting and receiving RF signals. Two wire helices are arranged in
bifilar manner within a dielectric sheet which is wound around the axis of the antenna. The
outer side of the dielectric sheet is affixed to a radome while the inner side is affixed to a
central tube. The wire helices are fed via feed lines which are positioned within the central
tube. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple, relatively high gain antenna
arrangement whose radiation lobe's angle of elevation can be simply adjusted.According to the invention there is provided an antenna assembly for transmitting or
receiving RF signals of a given wavelength, in which

<CLAIMS>
An antenna assembly for transmitting or receiving RF signals of a given wavelength, said
assembly comprising a metal feed tube member (1) having a feed line for connexion to an

RF signal source at one end thereof, and two wire helices (5,6) of predetermined length,
diameter and pitch arranged co-axially about said feed tube in a bifilar manner, one end of

each helix (5,6) being coupled to the the feed line, 
characterized
 in that the feed tube
member (1) has a co-axial inner conductor (2) as a part of the feed line, each helix (5,6)

being commonly coupled with one end to the inner conductor's (2) end and the other end
of each helix (5,6) being separately fixed to a first annular-shaped support member (7)

slidably encircling said feed tube member (1), said antenna assembly further includes a
calibrated adjustment means comprising a tubular housing member (12) of dielectric

material that is transparent to RF energy, and a tubular base member (13) into which one
end of said tubular housing member (12) slidably nests, said helices (5,6), said tubular

housing member (12) and said tubular base member (13) having a common axis and said
tubular housing member (12) enclosing said helices (5,6), and said first annular-shaped

support member (7) being attached to said tubular housing member (12), said tubular base
member (13) including two parallel screw channels (17) formed in the base member's (13)

inner surface which co-operate with two pin members (18) extending outwardly from a
portion of said tubular housing member (12) resting within said tubular base member (13)

such that selective partial rotation of said tubular housing member (12) causes a partial
rotation and axial movement of said first annular-shaped support member (7), whereby the

pitch of said helices (5,6) is changed by a predetermined distance and the diameter of said
helices (5,6) is substantially maintained, thereby changing the elevation angle of

electromagnetic waves radiating from or received by said antenna assembly at said given
wavelength to a desired angle of elevation corresponding to a selected calibration.
An antenna assembly as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that a second annular-shaped
support member (10) fixed to an end section of said metal feed tube (1) is included, said

second annular-shaped support member (10) including contact means for coupling said
one end of each helix (5,6) to said the inner conductor's (2) said other end. 
An antenna assembly as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that said contact means
comprises two contact zones (8,9) each of which is respectively connected to a said one

end of a helix, one of said contact zones (9) being further connected to the inner
conductor's (2) said other end, said contact zones (8,9) being coupled by a balun cable

means (11) of a predetermined length.
An antenna assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
 in that said
tubular housing member (12) includes calibration means (15) thereon.
An antenna assembly as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
 in that said calibration means
(15) comprise markings indicating geographic locations.
An antenna assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,

means (14) for releasably locking said tubular housing member (12) to said tubular base

member (13) are included.

characterized
