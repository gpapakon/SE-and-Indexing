<ABSTRACT>
An anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody according to 
the present invention can be: (1) a chimeric monoclonal 

antibody CD2 SFv-Ig produced by expression of the 
construct cloned in recombinant 
Escherichia coli
 culture 
ATCC No. 69277; (2) a monoclonal antibody having 

complementarity-determining regions identical with those 
of CD2 SFv-Ig; or (3) a monoclonal antibody competing 

with CD2 SFv-Ig for binding to CD2 antigen at least about 
80% as effectively on a molar basis as CD2 SFv-Ig. Anti-CD2 

monoclonal antibodies according to the present 
invention, as well as other antibodies that can modulate 

the interactions between T lymphocytes and monocytes, can 
be used to inhibit the production of HIV-1 by HIV-1-infected 

T cells in HIV-1-infected patients. In another 
use, T cells treated 
in vitro
 can be reinfused into AIDS 
patients to increase the proportion of functional, non-HIV-1-producing 

T cells in the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to monoclonal
antibodies and Fv specifically binding CD2 antigen and
the use of such monoclonal antibodies in preventing the
production of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in
HIV-1-infected T cells.Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has
become one of the most feared diseases of the latter part
of the twentieth century. In the United States alone,
about 40,000 new cases of AIDS are diagnosed yearly and
at least 200,000 cases have occurred since the disease
became recognized about 1981. It is believed that from 1
million to 1.5 million Americans are infected with HIV-1,
which means that they are at risk to develop AIDS and are
likely to do so unless a means can be found for
preventing the development of the full-blown illness in
patients infected with the virus. Worldwide, the number
of cases of AIDS runs into the millions, with certain
areas of Africa and the Caribbean having the highest
rates of infection. Until now, although the amount of money spent
for research on AIDS equals or exceeds that spent for
research on diseases such as cancer and heart disease, no
cure is yet available and the disease is considered
uniformly fatal. Although several treatments have been
developed that appear to slow the progression of the
disease, at least in some patients, such as the drugs
azidothymidine (AZT) and dideoxyinosine (DDI), these
treatments are regarded only as palliatives. They do not
work in all patients, and their effectiveness tends to
decrease over the course of the disease. Thus,
additional treatments for AIDS are urgently needed.It is generally believed that infection with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is required for
development of AIDS, although other factors may
contribute to the establishment and the progress of the
disease, because the disease is often associated with
drug abuse and with exposure to other pathogens that may
contribute to or enhance the immunosuppressive effects.
HIV-1 is a retrovirus of the lentivirus subfamily. Like
other retroviruses, its life cycle involves reverse
transcription and incorporation of the viral RNA genome
as DNA into the genome of the infected T cell.
Activation of the virus results in transcription and
translation, leading to production of the virus and
depletion of CD4+ T cells.One of the characteristics of AIDS is the
presence of opportunistic infections. These infections
include diarrhea caused by several bacterial species,
tuberculosis caused by avian and bovine mycobacteria,
viral infections such as
