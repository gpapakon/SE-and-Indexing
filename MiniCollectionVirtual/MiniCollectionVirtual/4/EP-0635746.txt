<ABSTRACT>
Multilayer lens particularly usable for sunglasses, 
having a main layer (2) made of polycarbonate, cellulose 

acetate, or similar materials. A mirror reflecting layer 
(4) is possibly coupled to the main layer or deposited 

thereon in vacuum by sublimation of appropriate substances, 
with the optional interposition of a layer of paint (3). 

The multilayer lens furthermore includes an outer layer (5) 
that partially affects the outer surface of the lens. The 

lens may also include an inner antifogging layer (9) that 
does not absorb moisture. This multilayer lens allows 

optimum vision to the user, eliminating or attenuating 
spurious incident rays at the lateral ends of the lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayer lens
particularly for sunglasses.Various kinds of multilayer lenses are currently known
and used for sunglasses which essentially comprise a
central layer made of polycarbonate or cellulose acetate or
similar materials.An outer reflecting mirror layer is sometimes coupled
to the central layer or is deposited thereon by sublimation
of appropriate substances and with the possible
interposition of a layer of paint.A layer that absorbs any moisture, by retaining the
moisture up to the saturation limit of the layer, is
instead placed internally.Some problems are observed if these conventional
lenses must have a highly curved shape, and thus if the
ends of the lens must affect the lateral regions of the
user's temples: first of all, the dimensions of the lens
are such that the user, while using the glasses, sees not
only whatever is in his front viewing field but also the
rays (hereinafter termed spurious) affecting the lens ends
arranged laterally to his viewing field, thus creating
unpleasant interference.This interference is highly relevant as the user's
concentration in sports practice increases, and this
concentration must be maximum in use during competitions.Furthermore, the use of an inner layer of antifogging
material according to the described characteristics, and
thus of a layer that gradually absorbs the moisture rising
from the face, in any case causes a drawback: after some 
time, in fact, once the layer has saturated, the lens fogs
again, forcing the user to remove his goggles to dry or
defog them.This condition certainly penalizes the user in all
sports practices.US-A-4 470 673 discloses eyewear with a frame which
supports a clear optical region dimensioned for
intercepting lines of sight substantially only within the
inferior field of view of the user's eyes and a translucent
region intercepting and blocking lines of sight directed
substantially outwardly from the mid pupillary position of
the user's eyes within the superior field of view.A principal aim of the present invention is therefore
to eliminate the above described drawbacks in known types
by providing a multilayer lens particularly for sunglasses
which despite surrounding not only the central region but
also, at least partially, the lateral regions of the
viewing field, allows the user optimum vision not only of
the front region but also partially of the lateral regions
without being negatively affected by bothersome spurious
rays.An important object of the invention is to provide a

<CLAIMS>
Multilayer lens which comprises a main layer (2) made
of polycarbonate, cellulose acetate, or similar materials,

said lens being characterized in that it comprises a
plurality of dead holes or of grooves removed from the

surface of said lens so as to at least partially darken said
lens at a lateral peripheric region (6) thereof.
Lens according to claim 1, further comprising a
reflecting layer (4) coupled with said main layer.
Lens according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said plurality of dead holes

or grooves are arranged at the ends of said lens and at the
regions adjacent to them towards the central region of said

lens.
Lens according to one or more of the preceding
claims 2-3, further comprising at least one layer (3) of paint

interposed between said main layer and said reflecting
layer.
Lens according to one or more of the preceding
claims, further comprising an inner antifogging layer (9) that

does not absorb moisture.
Lens according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said plurality of dead holes

have such a plan shape that they
allow to filter incident rays and redirect external

spurious rays.
Lens according to claim 5, characterized in that
said antifogging layer is applied at the inner surface of

said main layer or at the inner surface of a further layer,
equivalent to said reflecting layer, which is applied at 

the inner surface of said main layer.
Lens according to claim 7, characterized in that
said antifogging layer has antifogging properties, in the

sense that it does not absorb the moisture present on it
but constantly repels it, so as to achieve an antifogging

effect that is constant in the course of time.
Lens according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said plurality of dead holes

or grooves are configured such that the transparency of the
lens is variable and decreases from the center of the lens

towards its peripheral region.
