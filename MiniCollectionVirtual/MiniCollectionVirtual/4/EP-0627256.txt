<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a high-porosity metallic membrane element, 
comprising a sintered element having at least about 60% porosity, the sintered 

element comprising a matrix of substantially interconnected pores, each of the 
pores being defined by a plurality of dendritic metallic particles. A preferred 

form of the invention is made from pure nickel, preferably filamentous nickel 
powder. An article of manufacture made from the element includes a high-porosity 

metallic membrane filter, comprising the aforementioned sintered 
element having at least about 60% porosity, a filter housing, the housing 

thereby defining a filtered fluid flow path; and means for sealably connecting 
the casing to a fluid to be filtered. Another aspect of the invention is a method 

of making the high-porosity metallic membrane element, comprising the steps 
of depositing a substantially uniform low-density bed of a sinterable dendritic 

material into a mold suitable for applying compressive force thereto; 
compressing the low-density bed of sinterable dendritic material to form a 

green form; and sintering the green form. Filters made in accordance with 
this invention exhibit superior porosity, outgassing, and particle shedding 

characteristics when compared to the state-of-the-art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a fluid filter and a process for 
making it. In particular, the invention is a novel all-metal gas filter with high 
efficiency and low outgassing characteristics that is useful as a point-of-use 
filter for semiconductor process gases. Semiconductor manufacturing is constrained by the limitations of 
purity. In chemical vapor deposition of the alternating layers of silicon and 
dopant, a critical aspect of the process involves the absence of any particulate 
impurities. The presence of a minute particle can destroy an entire silicon 
wafer representing many dollars of potential end-product. To that end, an 
entire industry has developed concerned with only one thing-the filtering of 
the gases that may come into contact with semiconductor product during its 
formation. Clean rooms equipped with HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) 
filters are the first line of defense. Process equipment is located within "clean 
rooms" that are filled with carefully filtered air. The design of the equipment 
itself endeavors to minimize particle shedding, outgassing, and contamination 
from the materials used to transport and deliver high-purity gases such as 
silane, arsine, hydrochloric acid and phosphine. An important component in 
these delivery systems is the filter which insures that particulate contamination 
does not reach the point where the gas is discharged onto the work (point of 
use). These filters must not only remove any particulate material, but also 
must not add any gaseous contamination to the high purity gases. In addition, 
the gas delivery systems must also be as compact as possible to eliminate 
contamination, both particulate and gaseous, which might arise from either the 
installation of such systems, or the normal wear associated with usage. This is 
especially the case with highly corrosive gases such as hydrochloric acid.  
 
Therefore the filters must not only remove particulate material and not be a 
contributor of gaseous impurities, but they must also be as compact as possible 
and have small internal and filter volumes. Various filters are used for filtration of such gaseous fluids to insure 
ultra high levels of purity in terms of particulate contamination. These 
include: organic membrane filters, ceramic filters, filters formed from porous 
metal structures and filters formed from metal fibers. Although some of these 
various filter medias are capable of providing particulate contamination 
control to levels less than one part per
