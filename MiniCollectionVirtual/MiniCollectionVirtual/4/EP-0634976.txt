<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for ensuring that the correct container (10) containing a replenishment fluid is connected to a vessel (26) for that fluid. The container carries one component (18) of a pair of axially engageable members (20), the other (28) is carried by the vessel (26, 30), notably around the necks extending therefrom, so that the members (20, 30) have to engage and nest so as to allow the necks of the container and the vessel to engage fully and thus mount the container on the vessel, one of the members (18, 28) being a moveable fit upon the container (10) or vessel (26), preferably by virtue of being a snap fit thereon, so that the member can be rotated to align its projections (20) with the recesses (30) on the other member. The invention is of especial application in ink jet printers to identify solvent and ink refill bottles and ensure that they are connected to the correct reservoir and by the use of the snap fit members allows a conventional refill bottle and reservoir to be used to achieve this.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the replenishment of 
reservoirs, notably to a method of ensuring that the correct 
bottle or other source of replenishing ink or other fluid is 
fitted to a reservoir on a piece of equipment which has at 
least two reservoirs to be replenished with different 
substances supplied in replaceable containers. Some pieces of equipment, for example ink jet printers, have to 
be replenished with more than one fluid. For example these 
fluids may be an ink and a separate top-up fluid which is a 
solvent or carrier for the ink to adjust the viscosity of the 
ink during operation of the printer. The replenishment fluids 
are conventionally supplied in plastic bottles, metal flasks or 
other containers, the neck or outlet of which is secured into 
a corresponding socket at the inlet to the reservoir or other 
vessel holding the supply of that fluid for use in the 
equipment. For convenience the term container will be used 
herein to denote in general the bottle, flask, etc in which the 
replenishment fluid is supplied to the equipment; and the term 
vessel will be used to denote the tank or other reservoir in 
which the fluid is stored in the equipment for use during the 
operation of the equipment. The container and the vessel are often constructed so as to 
allow the replenishment fluid to flow from the container into 
the vessel once the outlet of the container has been seated 
home upon the inlet to the vessel, for example by having 
suitable engaging valve members. Where the equipment uses a 
number of different fluids, for example inks and solvents or 
different coloured inks in an ink jet printer, it is necessary 
to ensure that the correct container is fitted to the correct 
vessel to avoid contamination of one fluid with another and 
possible damage to the equipment, for example by feeding  
 
corrosive concentrated solvent through an ink line. It has been proposed to colour code the cap or other closure of 
a container to identify the fluid contained therein and to 
colour code the vessels so that a user can readily see which 
container should be fitted to which vessel. However, this does 
not physically prevent the wrong container from being connected 
to a vessel, notably by a person who is colour blind. It has therefore been proposed, as is acknowledged in US Patent 
no 4907019, to form the neck of the container with a series of 
axial flutes which engage with axial slots formed in the inlet 
bore of the vessel, so that a container can only be fitted to 
a vessel

mounted as a move-able fit (18, 22) upon either the inlet 
(28) or outlet (16), the said annular members (18, 28) 

carrying one or more axially inter-engageable members (20, 
30) whereby engagement of the inter-engageable members 

(20, 30) is required before the container (10) can be 
secured in flow communication with the vessel (26). 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that one annular member (18) carries a circumferentially distributed 

series of 
axial projections (20) and the other annular member (28) 

carries a circumferentially distributed series of corresponding 
axially 

extending recesses (30) adapted to receive the 
projections (20) of the other member (28) whereby the 

assembly (14, 28) can be axially foreshortened when the 
projections (20) are engaged in to the recesses (30). 
An assembly as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that at least one of the annular members 

(18, 28) is provided with radially inwardly projecting 
members (22) adapted to engage the outer wall of the 

inlet (28) or outlet (16) upon which it is to be mounted.  
 
A means (14, 28) for relating the identity of a 
container (10) to a vessel (26) to which the container 

(10) is to be connected so as to discharge a replenishment 
fluid from the container (10) to the vessel (26) via an 

outlet (16) from the container (10) which engages with an 
inlet (28) to the vessel (26), at least one of said inlet 

(28) or outlet (16) being carried on a neck member 
extending from the container (10) and/or the vessel (26), 

and in which the said inlet (28) and outlet (16) are each 
to be provided with one component (20 or 30) of a pair of 

inter-engaging members (20 and 30) which require 
engagement before the container (10) can be secured in 

fluid flow communication with the vessel (26), 
characterised in that:
 
at least one of the interengaging members (14) is provided
