<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a workpiece clamping device with a base plate and stop elements and clamping elements capable of being fixed thereon, which can be simply handled and offers a high degree of flexibility with regard to the clamping possibilities. For this purpose, provision is made for the stop element (18) to have a base body (24) which is preferably integrally equipped with a positioning part (30) capable of being brought into engagement with the base plate (10, 76), and for the periphery of the base body (24) to be constructed as a polygonal arrangement (26), the edges (28) of which are at different distances from a centre axis of the positioning part.

<CLAIMS>
A workpiece-clamping device with a base plate and at least one clamping element and
stop element secured thereto in each case, wherein the stop element (18) comprises a base

member (24) which has associated therewith a positioning part (30) engageable with the
base plate (10) and having a circular cross-section, wherein the positioning part (30)

projects beyond the base member (24) in the direction towards the base plate (10) and

engages in a fitted manner in a through opening (58) in a spacer member (56) resting
against the opposed walls of a neck (40) of a T-shaped groove (12) in the base plate (10),

wherein the spacer member (56) has a periphery with a polygonal arrangement, every
two opposed edges of the spacer member (56) are at an equal distance from each other

and the through opening (58) is arranged eccentrically to the edges of the spacer member
(56), and wherein a clamping member (42) is guided in the T-shaped groove (12), the

said clamping member (42) being provided with a threaded bore (46) which is orientated
in the direction of the neck (40) and into which a threaded clamping screw (32) engaging

through the positioning part (30) is screwed, and wherein the periphery of the base
member (24) is constructed as a polygonal arrangement (26), the edges (28) of which are

at varying distances from the median axis of the positioning part.
A workpiece-clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the positioning
part (30) is constructed integrally with the base member (24).
A workpiece-clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the positioning
part (30) is arranged on the threaded clamping screw constructed in the form of a

collar screw (87).
A workpiece-clamping device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the fastening
member (86) is constructed as a separate part which is arranged so as to be insertable in a

bore in the base member (24).
