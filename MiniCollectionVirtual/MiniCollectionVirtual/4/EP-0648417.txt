A fungicidal mixture containing 

a) the oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I 

 
and either 
b.1 the oxime ether carboxylic acid ester of the formula II 

 
or 
b.2 the methoxyacrylic acid ester of the formula III 

 
in a synergistically active amount. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the oxime ether carboxylic acid ester of the 
formula II as claimed in claim 1 in a synergistically active 

amount. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the methoxyacrylic acid ester of the formula III 
as claimed in claim 1 in a synergistically active amount. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
weight ratio of the compound I to the compound II or the compound 

III is from 10:1 to 0.1:1. 
A process for controlling harmful fungi, which comprises 
treating the harmful fungi, their environment or the plants, 

seeds, soils, surfaces, materials or spaces to be kept free 
from them with the compound of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the compound of the formula II as claimed in 
claim 1 or the compound of the formula I as claimed in claim 

1 and the compound of the formula III as claimed in claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the compound I as 
claimed in claim 1 and the compound II as claimed in claim 1 

or the compound III as claimed in claim 1 are applied simultaneously 

jointly or separately, or successively. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the harmful fungi, 
their environment or the plants, seeds, soils, surfaces, materials 

or spaces to be kept free from them are treated with 
from 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha of the compound I as claimed in 

claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the harmful fungi, 
their environment or the plants, seeds, soils, surfaces, materials 

or spaces to be kept free from them are treated with 
from 0.01 to 0.5 kg/ha of the compound II as claimed in 

claim 1 or of the compound III as claimed in claim 1. 
The use of the compound I as claimed in claim 1 for the production 
of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1.  
 
The use of the compound II as claimed in claim 1 for the production 
of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1. 
The use of the compound III as claimed in claim 1 for the 
production of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1.
