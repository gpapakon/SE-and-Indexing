<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for forming sheet metal blanks (80) within a press (10) having base and outer (11) and inner (12) slides and including a basic die (15, 16, 17, 18) mountable to the press and tooling (25, 51) mountable to the basic die. The basic die includes an upper shoe (15) mountable to the outer slide (11), and hydraulic cylinder assemblies (17, 18) mounted on the base and actuatable by the inner slide for providing pressurized fluid to the tooling. The tooling includes upper and lower dies (51, 25) connected to the upper shoe (15) and base. A blank (80) is positioned upon the lower die (25) the upper die (51) is moved to a closed position by the outer slide (11), the blank (8) is clamped by gripper steels (75) located in the upper die (51). The outer slide (11) dwells while the inner slide (12) moves down, actuating the cylinder assemblies (17, 18), causing hydraulic fluid to be forced between the blank (80) and the lower die (25) to 100 % stretch form the blank into the upper die (51).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of sheet metal 
forming, and in particular to an apparatus and method for 
hydroforming sheet metal into parts such as automobile fenders, 
doors, hoods and the like. In the high-production cookware, appliance and automotive 
industries, as well as the low- and medium-production aircraft, 
aerospace, and job-shop industries, metallic sheet may be 
formed by a variety of different dies, the type and size of the  
 
die being dictated by the shape and intended use of the 
particular part. One process which is used to form a wide 
variety of these parts is the conventional drawing process. In 
a draw die, the blank is drawn across a binder surface allowing 
metal to flow from the bind surface and onto the part. 
Unfortunately, variable and non-uniform stresses are thereby 
developed throughout the part which results in localized 
stretching. This creates severe springback and shape retention 
problems which makes it nearly impossible to predict, 
especially with large parts, the amount of springback that will 
occur. The common practice to overcome this springback or 
shape retention problem is to overcrown (deform beyond the 
desired shape) the part. Finding the appropriate degree of 
overcrown requires a number of costly trial and error 
procedures. There is also a significant amount of material 
waste in the drawing process because the blank is oversized to 
compensate for the metal flowing across the binder surface and 
to account for varying part strength resulting from non-uniform 
work hardening. In my U.S. Patent No. 4,576,030, I describe a process 
wherein sheet metal can be one hundred percent stretch formed 
between co-acting male and female die halves. This is 
accomplished by providing a pair of opposed gripper steels, at 
least one of which is provided with a number of spaced apart 
beads adapted to bite into the sheet metal, around the  
 
periphery thereof, when the gripper steels are closed. 
This permits the sheet metal to be homogeneously, one 
hundred percent stretch formed, thus resulting in a 
higher quality of shape retention, a reduction in the 
number of shock lines and stretch lines, less waste, and 
increased overall part strength. US-A-4,576,030, on which the precharacterising portions of independent 
claims 1 and 13 are based, discloses an apparatus and method 
for stretch forming sheet metal without drawing the 
sheet metal. The die used comprises complementary male 
and female die halves moveable between open and closed 
positions,
