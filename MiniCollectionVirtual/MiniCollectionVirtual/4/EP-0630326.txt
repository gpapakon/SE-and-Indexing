<ABSTRACT>
Fine lines, e.g. 0.5 to 0.8 mm wide, can be produced by the use of an auxiliary nib unit (16) which fits over a (main) nib on a felt or fibre tip marker (1) or on a technical pen. The auxiliary nib (20) is a friction fit in its housing (18). The marker cap (10) may contain a receptacle (14) for storage of the auxiliary nib (16). The auxiliary nib is movable axially of its housing to as to come into ink-transfer contact with the main nib irrespective of wear or distortion of the latter. The main nib (8) may be of fibrous material, and the auxiliary nib (20) may be a hollow extrudate of plastics material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nib units, especially for felt 
and fibre tip marker pens, though the invention is also 
of value in the field of technical pens. Felt and fibre tip marker pens have found widespread 
acceptance in a variety of fields of use. They are 
available commercially in a substantial number of shapes 
and sizes depending upon the intended use. Common to all 
of them, however, is some form of ink reservoir adapted 
to enable ink to feed to a tip or nib formed of felted or 
laid fibrous material, the latter particularly in the 
case of smaller size nibs. The nib is protected against 
drying out, and inadvertent contact with other surfaces 
when the pen is not in use, by an end cap. The reservoir 
may be provided with a small passage to atmosphere, to 
keep the ink in the reservoir under atmospheric pressure 
irrespective of changes in its volume. The size of the nib is an important consideration for 
felt and fibre tip pens. It determines the stroke width 
of a line drawn with the pen. The stroke width is 
usually chosen in line with the intended use of the pen,  
 
wide nibs being used for writing large inscriptions, e.g. 
on the outsides of parcels, or colouring in large areas 
when making artwork, and narrow nibs being used for fine 
artistic graphic work or for normal fine handwriting. The particular selection of felt and fibre tip marking 
implement may depend on a variety of considerations. In 
the professional use of such markers for creating 
artwork, however, a major consideration is the 
availability of the marker in a given colour. There are 
several commercially manufactured ranges of coloured 
markers available in a wide variety of colours. Some of 
these are available as so-called "double-ended" markers, 
with a relatively-wide nib at one end and a relatively-narrow 
nib at the other, each with its respective end 
cap. Ranges of such markers, commonly referred to as art 
markers, are purchased by graphic artists and commercial 
artists in particular, because of their availability in a 
wide range of colours. Such artists sometimes find that in order to secure a 
specific effect, in particular to secure a desired very 
fine line, for use in detailed work, even the thinnest 
nib available is too wide for such use. The nibs of such 
markers are, however, often made of a parallel-oriented 
nylon, polyester or acrylic fibre compact, which has a 
relatively firm texture and which can be sharpened, as by 
using a craft knife, to give a considerably thinner nib. The problem with

<CLAIMS>
A nib conversion unit for converting a marker 
implement having a fixed main nib of one size into 

an implement with an effective auxiliary nib of 
smaller size, the unit comprising a housing adapted 

to engage detachably the end of the implement 
adjacent to the main nib, the housing carrying a 

thin auxiliary nib adapted, when the housing is so 
engaged, to enter into liquid communication with the 

main nib and to project from the housing to operate 
as a capillary-fed nib,
 
characterised in that,
 
the auxiliary nib is movable axially of the housing, 

whereby it may be moved into ink-transfer contact 
with the main nib by force applied to the tip of the 

auxiliary nib. 
A nib unit according to Claim 1, wherein the housing 
is formed of a resilient rubber or plastics 

material, and wherein the auxiliary nib is of 
extruded plastics material. 
A nib unit as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the main nib 

and the auxiliary nib lies within the range of 6:1 
to 1.5:1. 
A nib unit as claimed in any preceding claim, in 
which the auxiliary nib is such that ink can be 

transferred to it by end-to-end and/or side-by-side 
contact with the main nib. 
A nib unit as claimed in any preceding claim, in  
 

which the main nib is formed from bonded fibres of 
nylon, polyester, acrylic or like plastics material. 
A nib unit as claimed in Claim 2, or Claim 2 and any 
claim dependent therefrom, in which the extruded nib 

is sheathed with metal or plastics. 
A nib unit as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the 
auxiliary nib is gripped by two or more ribs 

integral with the housing, the ribs defining 
channels along which air may flow. 
A felt or fibre tip marker unit consisting of a 
barrel, a cap, an ink reservoir and a capillary-fed 

felt or fibre main nib and, temporarily attached to 
the nib or cap thereof, a nib conversion unit 

according to any one of Claims 1 to 6. 
A marker unit according to Claim 8, wherein the cap 
has a receptacle adapted to receive and store the 

nib conversion unit. 
A marker unit according to Claim 8 or 9, wherein the 
cap has a white markable area colourable by the main 

or auxiliary nib.
