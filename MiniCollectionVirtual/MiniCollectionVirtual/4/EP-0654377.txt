<ABSTRACT>
A rear view mirror for motor vehicles is provided with a casing (1), a mirror glass support (3) which is mounted so as to be pivotable by means of a pivot joint arranged in the said casing (1) and a piece of mirror glass (7) which is arranged on the mirror glass support (3). The mirror glass support (3) takes the form of a hollow body which bounds an assembly space (25) into which there can be mounted at least one motor actuator (26, 27) to permit the remote controlled pivoting of the mirror glass support (3) and therefore of the mirror glass (7) in respect to the casing (1).

<CLAIMS>
A rear view mirror for motor vehicles, in particular for commercial
vehicles, comprising


a mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") supported by means of a pivot
joint (2) to be pivotable, and
a mirror glass (7) disposed on the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3"),
wherein the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") is a hollow defining an

installation chamber (25), into which at least one servomotor (26,
27) is installable for the remote-controlled pivotal adjustment of

the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") and thus of the mirror glass (7),

characterized in that
 the rear view mirror is provided with a housing
(1,1'), accommodating the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") with

the mirror glass (7) and the pivot joint.
A rear view mirror according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the mirror
glass support (3, 3', 3") is a hollow pan open towards the mirror

glass (7).
A rear view mirror according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 on a
plane (13) extending parallel to the mirror glass plane, the mirror glass

support (3) is divided into a base member (14) and a frame member
(15) placed thereon and carrying the mirror glass (7).
A rear view mirror according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
in that
 supporting webs (18, 18') projecting towards the mirror glass
(7) are molded in the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") to support the rear

of the mirror glass (7). 
A rear view mirror according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 a
holding plate (21), on which the mirror glass (7) is fixed, is attachable

to the mirror glass support (3") for the fastening of the mirror glass (7)
to the mirror glass support (3").
A rear view mirror according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
in that
 the at least one servomotor (26, 27) is arranged in the installation
chamber (25) of the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") to be stationary

relative to the latter and 
in that
 its movable positioning element (29) is
coupled by articulation with a support member (39, 42, 42') stationary

relative to the housing (1, 1').
A rear view mirror according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the pivot
joint (2) is a spherical universal joint, in which a spherical bearing ring

(35) molded on the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3") is clamped by frictional
locking between a spherical bearing member (36) fixed to the

housing (1) and disposed on the rear of the mirror glass support (3, 3',
3") and a spherical bearing cover (37) on the inside of the mirror glass

support (3, 3', 3"), the bearing cover (37) supporting itself on an abutment
member (39) fixed to the housing (1) and disposed on the inside

of the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3"), which abutment member (39) is
simultaneously the support member for the movable positioning element

(29) of the at least one servomotor (26, 27).
A rear view mirror according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the movable
positioning element (29) of the at least one servomotor (26, 27) is

linked with the coupling plate (34), fixed to the housing (1), by way of
a slider crank mechanism (30, 31), the coupling plate (34) being attachable

on the abutment member (39, 42, 42') in a manner fixed to the 
housing (1).
A rear view mirror according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the at
least one slider crank mechanism comprises a crank disc (29) linked

with the coupling plate (34) by way of a connecting rod (31) articulated
on the crank disc (29) and guided in a guide sleeve (32, 33) of the coupling

plate (34).
A rear view mirror according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized
in that
 the rear view mirror is feasible, in the way of a unit assembly
system, as a manually adjustable mirror by the at least one servomotor

(26, 27) being omitted, or as a remote-controlled adjustable mirror by
the at least one servomotor (26, 27) being placed in the installation

chamber (25) of the mirror glass support (3, 3', 3").
