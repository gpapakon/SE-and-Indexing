<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for providing a continuous supply of oil 
on camshaft lobes (34, 35) used in an overhead cam internal 

combustion engine. The mechanism includes camshaft bearing 
caps (50) affixed to the engine about the camshaft journals 

(46). 
Protruding from the side surface of the central 

portion of the bearing caps are oil diverter pads (64). The 
oil diverter pads cause oil that builds up on the surface of 

the camshaft journals (46) to be diverted toward the 
camshaft lobes to provide lubrication between the camshaft 

lobes (34, 35) and the roller finger followers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
lubricating the cam lobes of camshafts in an internal
combustion engine.A typical concern with valve train lubrication in an
internal combustion engine is assuring an adequate supply of
oil on the cam lobes while the engine is operating, for all
engine conditions. When the camshaft in an overhead cam
engine, in particular, is operating, it is critical that the
cam lobes are well lubricated. This is typically done using
the engine oil. Without adequate oil supply to the cam
lobes, the components can overheat and fail. Thus, the
supply of oil to lubricate the lobes is critical under all
operating conditions and engine speeds, including low engine
speeds.An example of one current method of supplying oil is
to allow oil to bleed off out of top holes in lash adjusters
through holes in roller finger followers. The oil then
flows by the force of gravity along the top surface of the
body of the roller finger follower toward the areas in need
of lubrication. While this works adequately for some
geometries of cam and roller configurations, oil does not
always flow properly for all configurations.Of particular difficulty with the geometry of
overhead cam engines is when one of the two sets of valves
is located above all but the valve contacting tip portion of
the roller finger followers such that gravitational force
will cause the oil to flow away from rather than toward the
critical areas in need of lubrication. That is, the oil
will flow off of the roller finger follower and down to the
tappet gallery floor, thus providing no lubrication to the
cam lobes and roller of the roller finger follower.Some attempted solutions to this problem include
adding extra oil passages around the cams as in GB 2011569A to supply oil
directly to the cam lobes, at the added cost, weight of 
additional parts and loss of oil pressure in the overall
system; or adding parts that force oil to be sprayed onto
the cams at the expense of additional parts and the
resultant loss of oil pressure in the overall oil system.
Thus, the need arises for an oiling mechanism that will
assure adequate oil supply to the cam lobes at all engine
speeds while not losing oil pressure or adding significant
cost increases.In its embodiments, the present invention
contemplates an oiling mechanism for use in an internal
combustion engine having a camshaft which includes a journal
portion having oil supplied to its surface and a cam lobe
portion. The oiling mechanism is comprised of at least one
camshaft bearing
