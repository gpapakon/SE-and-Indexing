<ABSTRACT>
A plain bearing comprising a bearing alloy is described which is in the form of 
a supersaturated solid solution or naturally aged and is age-hardenable in the 

operation of the machine where it is mounted in by contact with the associated 
component in sliding contact therewith. The plain bearing is at the beginning 

of the aging sufficiently soft to adapt to the operational parameters and has 
during later operation sufficient strength and hardness to withstand the changed 

operational conditions. The bearing alloy is preferably an aluminium bearing 
alloy which contains alloying components such as copper, silicon, magnesium 

or zinc. According to the method for age-hardening the plain bearing is 
mounted in the relevant machine without being previously subjected to heat 

treatment. The heat treatment is then performed in the machine during its 
normal operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a finished plain bearing mounted in a machine, particularly an 
internal combustion engine. The invention also relates to a method for the age-hardening 
of bearing alloys of plain bearings in which the bearing alloy is to 
be subjected to heat treatment. In DE-A-2043676 a method for the production of bimetal bearings is described. 
The bearing material, that can be treated as stripes or half-finished products, is 
heated up to a temperature between 480 and 525°C in a lead bath. After that the 
stripe is quenched very quickly in order to maintain the supersaturated condition. 
After quenching a heat treatment at 175°C over 10h is performed to get a certain 
hardness and then the bearing is formed. Therefore, the finished product is 
already age-hardened when it is mounted in the machine. An amorphous laminated material for sliding elements is desribed in WO 
89/02365. The production of the laminated material is effected by coating a melt 
of the alloy and by quenching the foil strip at cooling rates between 106 K/s and 
109 K/s. The material of the sliding layer is frozen in the amorphous state. As 
laminated material is only a half-finished product it has to be treated and 
machined by further operational steps. None of the prior art publications describes a finished plain bearing which is not 
age-hardened. Finished plain bearings which are mounted in machines, particularly internal 
combustion engines of motor cars, must meet various requirements. On the one hand a plain bearing must have a certain strength to be able to 
withstand, without damage, alternating loading in operation, and on the other 
hand the bearing alloy must also be sufficiently soft to embed foreign particles, 
which is important particularly during the running-in of the engine. It is also 
important for the bearing alloy to be able to adapt during running-in to the 
component in sliding contact therewith, e.g. a crankshaft, without this resulting 
in damage to the bearing material already at the beginning of the operation of 
the machine. In order to fulfil these various tasks, age-hardening bearing alloys which have 
the desired strength have been provided with a running-in layer of soft 
material, e.g. tin. This running-in layer is to a large extent abraded during the 
operation of the machine so that the bearing alloy, which is situated below it 
and has the correponding strength values, is exposed and this layer is 
satisfactory for the requirements on continuous operation and consequently on 
alternat

<CLAIMS>
A finished plain bearing comprising a bearing alloy mounted in a machine, 
particularly an internal combustion engine, characterized in 


that the bearing alloy is in the form of a supersaturated solid solution or is 
naturally aged and is not age-hardened before mounting in the machine 

and 
that the bearing alloy is age-hardenable during the operation of the 
machine due to temperatures generated by friction between the plain 

bearing and the associated component of the machine in sliding contact therewith. 
A finished plain bearing according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
hardness of the supersaturated solid solution is below 10% of the 

difference between the maximum achievable hardness obtained during 
operation and the quench value, and that the hardness increases in 

operation continuous until the maximum hardness is obtained. 
A finished plain bearing according to any of claims 1 to 2, characterized 
in that the bearing alloy is an aluminium bearing alloy which contains 

alloying components such as copper, silicon, magnesium or zinc either 
alcne or in combination, and also soft components such as tin, bismuth, 

lead or antimony and possibly trace admixtures, such for instance 
chromium, manganese or zirconium. 
A method for the age-hardening of bearing alloys of plain bearings 
characterized in that the plain bearing is mounted in a machine with the  

 
bearing alloy being in the form of a supersaturated solid solution or 

naturally aged, the age-hardening treatment being then performed in the 
machine during its operation due to the temperatures generated by friction 

between the plain bearing and the component in sliding contact therewith. 
A method according to claim 4 characterized in that the heat treatment is 
performed during the running-in of the machine, so that after running-in of 

the machine 90 % of the maximum hardness is achieved. 
A method according to claims 4 or 5 characterized in that the 
supersaturated solid solution is obtained by rapid solidification from a 

molten material. 
A method according to claim 6 characterized in that the 
rapid solidification is obtained by a direct solidification of the bearing 

material directly onto a metallic substrate.
