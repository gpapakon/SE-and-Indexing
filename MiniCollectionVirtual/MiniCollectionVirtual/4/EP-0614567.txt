<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to 
semiconductor memories and more particularly to a 
nonvolatile random access memory formed in a wide band 
gap semiconductor, each cell of which comprises a 
transistor and a charge storage device. In general, semiconductor memories may be 
divided into three classes: random-access memories 
(RAM's), read-only memories (ROM's), and programmable 
read-only memories (PROM's). RAM's are used to store 
large volumes of data which must be read and written at 
high speeds. ROM's may not be electrically written; 
they store data which may be read at high speeds but 
not changed by the system during operation. PROM's may 
be erased and reprogrammed, but only at very slow 
rates, so that reprogramming is not feasible during 
system operation. In effect, PROM's may be regarded as 
ROM's which may be programmed once (or at most a few 
times) by the user. There are two important operating 
characteristics which describe semiconductor memories: 
(i) volatility, and (ii) writability. Volatility 
refers to the time period over which a memory will 
store data. A memory is said to be nonvolatile if the 
data is retained for a useful period of time after 
power is removed. Both ROM's and PROM's are  
 
nonvolatile. Writability refers to the ability of the 
memory to be written with new data at high speeds by 
the system during operation, i.e., the ability to store 
data which is the result of calculations performed by 
the system or new data to be processed by the system. 
In this sense, RAM's are writable, but ROM's are not. Thus, RAM's offer writability, but not 
nonvolatility. ROM's are nonvolatile, but also 
nonwritable. Another memory alternative is the dynamic 
random access memories, or DRAM's, which are widely 
used in modern digital computing systems for high-speed 
data storage and retrieval. In a DRAM, the data 
storage is said to be "dynamic," because data is 
retained only for a relatively short time, typically on 
the order of a few seconds at room temperature. The 
basic DRAM cell consists of an access transistor and a 
storage capacitor. An example of such a memory cell 
may be seen in U.S. Patent 4,163,243 by Kamins et al. 
entitled "One-Transistor Memory Cell With Enhanced 
Capacitance." Data is written into the cell by turning 
on the access transistor so that the potential applied 
to the bit line is connected directly to the storage 
capacitor. When the access transistor is turned off, 
the storage capacitor remains charged to the potential 
of the bit line until
