<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic fluid composition
and in particular to a brake fluid composition.The preparation is known of hydraulic fluids based on glycol
ethers and/or based on boric esters of glycol ethers. These
hydraulic fluids most often contain additives, in particular
corrosion-inhibiting or oxidation inhibiting additives and a
neutralizing agent.The preparation is known of hydraulic fluids containing amines
as corrosion-inhibiting additives and/or as neutralizing agents. In
particular, the use is known, according to European Patent
Application EP-A-454 110 and Patent US 3 711 410, of alkanolamines.
However, it was observed that these alkanolamines do not make it
possible to prepare hydraulic fluids of high boiling point which
simultaneously have a number of specific characteristics. In
particular, they do not make it possible to prepare hydraulic fluids
having a desired viscosity and optionally a desired volatility as a
function of the boiling point, while moreover having good
compatibility with elastomers of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)
type, a basic pH and good corrosion-inhibiting properties.The present invention relates to a high boiling point
hydraulic fluid composition which makes it possible to solve the
problems mentioned above.The subject of the present invention is thus a hydraulic fluid
composition based on at least one glycol ether or on at least one
boric ester of a glycol ether or a mixture of the two, characterised 
in that it contains, as additive, at least one ether-amine having a
molecular weight between 120 and 300 and having the following
formula:

in which R3 is linear or branched radical having at least one ether
functional group and no alcohol functional group, R is a methyl
radical or a hydrogen atom, p is an integer from 1 to 3 and q is an
integer from 0 to 2.According to the present invention, the composition contains
an ether-amine used essentially as a corrosion-inhibiting additive
and/or a neutralizing agent. This ether-amine has a molecular weight
between 120 and 300. When an ether-amine is used which has a lower
molecular weight, a composition is obtained which is volatile and
which has a low boiling point. Moreover, when an ether-amine is used
which has a greater molecular weight, a composition is obtained
which has an excessively high viscosity. The molecular weight of the
ether-amine is preferably from 150 to 250.According to the invention, the ether-amine used must contain
a radical R3 which is a linear or branched radical having at least
one
