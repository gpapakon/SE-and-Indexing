<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to write equalization 
techniques in magnetic tape recording. Magnetic tape drives store digital 
information as transitions of magnetic flux on the 
surface of a magnetic tape. These transitions are 
separated by varying lengths, the ratio between the 
maximum and minimum lengths varying according to the 
data storage standard being used. For example, the 1,7 
run length limited standard, 1,7 RLL, calls for a 
minimum separation of one binary "0" between 
transitions (binary "1's") and a maximum separation of 
seven "0's" between transitions ("1's"). Thus, the 
number of clock cells between transitions using the 1,7 
RLL standard varies between a minimum of two and a 
maximum of eight clock cells. In reading data from a magnetic tape, a read 
head passes over the flux transitions. The flux 
transitions induce a signal in the read head. The 
amplitude of the signal induced in the read head varies 
substantially depending on the transition separation, 
with the signal amplitude of an eight cell separation 
being much greater than that of a two cell separation. 
It is desirable to lessen differences in the amplitude 
of the signals induced in the read head by the minimum 
and maximum separations. The process of such 
minimization is known as equalization. Originally, all equalization was accomplished 
on the readback of the data. Accomplishing the entire 
equalization process during the readback made the 
readback process and hardware more complicated, and 
introduced a greater likelihood of errors during the 
readback operation. For that reason, write 
equalization has been developed to split the burden of  
 
equalization of the data separations between write and 
readback operations. A magnetic recording device writes data on a 
magnetic tape by passing a current through the write 
head. The write head creates a magnetic field which 
induces a magnetic alignment on the surface of the 
recording medium. The data pattern that is written on the 
magnetic tape can be understood by considering the 
write current waveform passed through the write head. 
When, for example, the 1,7 RLL data recording standard 
is used, the direction of the write current flowing 
through the write head changes every time a binary "1" 
is to be written on the tape. For example, a binary 
"1" bracketed by binary "0's" will be written by a 
change in the direction of the write current in the 
write head at the binary "1", preceded and followed by 
periods in which the write current flows in opposite 
directio
