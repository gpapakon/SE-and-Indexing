<ABSTRACT>
A method of reinforcing a textile top fabric by applying 
to a surface of the top fabric a heat fusible interlining 

comprising a thermoplastic polymeric resin net and fusing 
the net to the surface of the top fabric under heat and 

pressure characterised in that the heat fusible interlining is a 
multi-layered composite net comprising a heat sealing layer 

of polymeric resin and a substrate layer of different polymerÂ­
ic resin which has a melting temperature higher than that of 

the heat sealing layer said method being carried out at a 
temperature such that the heat sealing layer melts but the 

substrate layer does not melt and reinforced top fabrics 
made thereby are described.

 METHOD OF REINFORCING TEXTILE TOP
 FABRICS AND PRODUCTS MADE THEREBY
 The invention relates to a method of reinforcing a textile top fabric and reinforced top fabrics made thereby. A top fabric is the outer fabric layer of garments such as coats, shirts, dresses, blouses or parts thereof; curtain material, drapery headers, ties, upholstery and the like made of natural or synthetic fibres.


 Save for certain so-called unconstructed garments, practically all apparel needs to have some areas or parts of the garment reinforced, in order to stiffen, support, stabilise or provide body to a textile top fabric. For example, shirt collars and cuffs require bodying linings.


A jacket chest needs additional reinforcement so that it may be shaped. A waistband may need the firm support of a lining. Coat lapels have to be supported in order for them to hold their shape.


 Until about 1940, all such reinforcing of textile materials was done with stiffened interlinings or buckrams, which were sewn into the garment at required stiffening points. This reinforcing was never of the  whole garment but always of selected portions thereof.


During the 1940s, a labour saving technique came into use whereby these reinforcements of interlining pieces were no longer being sewn into the garments but rather were being used on selected garment surfaces. The conventional interlinings gradually became obsolete and were replaced by fabrics coated with thermoplastic, thermofusible chemicals which were resistant to washing and/or dry cleaning. Thus, a new industry, that of fusible linings and interlinings was created.


 The evolution and refinement of this new art is well documented in the literature. Representative of descriptions found in the prior art are the following:

Industry S.6 published by the Apparel Research Foundation

Principles of Heat Sealing Adhesives for Fusible
Interlinings, Textilverdlung 6, pages 459-468 (1971).


 Thermofusible chemicals served a dual function, first as an adhesive and then as a bodying agent, the weight and volume of the chemicals making it possible to use lighter  substrate cloths. The earliest thermofusible coatings were knife or roller coat continuous coatings such as plasticized cellulose acetate or mixtures of novolac and polyvinyl acetate. In the manufacture of shirts,

 WHAT WE CLAIM IS:



 1. A method of reinforcing a textile top fabric by applying to a surface of the top fabric a heat fusible interlining comprising a thermoplastic polymeric resin net and fusing the net to the surface of the top fabric under heat and pressure characterised in that the heat fusible interlining is a multi-layered composite net comprising a heat sealing layer of polymeric resin and a substrate layer of different polymeric resin which has a melting temperature higher than that of the heat sealing layer said method being carried out at a temperature such that the heat sealing layer melts but the substrate layer does not melt.



 2. A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the net   comprises    coextruded polymer layers.



 3. A method as claimed in either claims 1 or 2 in    
>
 ich    the net consists essentially of a substrate layer    a a heat sealing layer.   



 4. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 in   which    the substrate layer has a melting temperature of more than 800C and the heat sealing layer has a melting temperature of less than 1500C.  



 5. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 in which the substrate layer has a melting temperature of   1500C    to 2500C and the heat sealing layer has a melting temperature of 1100C to 1350C.



 6. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 in which the substrate layer comprises polypropylene and the heat sealing layer comprises polyethylene.



 7. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6 in which the heat sealing layer comprises a linear low density polyethylene.



 8. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7 in
Which the net has a weight per unit area of 10 to 40   g/sq.m.   




 9. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8 in
Which the heat sealing layer comprises 25% to 40% by weight of the net.




 10. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9 in which the net has a regular pattern of intersecting   strands    and openings and and comprises a first set of parallel strands which intersect with a second set of parallel strands to give 3 to 8 per cm intersections per  strand in the direction of both sets of strands.



 11. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10 in which the heat sealing layer has a colour which is different from that of the substrate layer to aid identification of the heat sealing layer.

 


 12. A reinforced textile top fabric produced by a method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11.



 13. A reinforced textile top fabric which has a heat fusible interlining comprising a thermoplastic polymeric resin net heat sealed to the surface of the fabric characterised in that the heat fusible interlining is a multi-layered composite net comprising a heat sealing layer of polymeric resin and a substrate layer of a different polymeric resin which has a melting temperature higher than that of the heat sealing layer said net having been heat sealed to the surface of the fabric at a   temperature    at which the heat sealing layer melts but the   substrate    layer does not melt.
