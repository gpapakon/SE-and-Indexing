<ABSTRACT>
A new and improved air bag module of 
lightweight construction includes a rectangular 

support frame (12) defining an open mouth for the 
mounting of an air bag (20) and having spaced apart 

opposing end walls (36,38) and spaced apart opposing 
side walls (32,34). An inflator support (42,44) 

depends from each of the end walls of the rectangular 
support frame to support the inflator (16) beneath the 

support frame. A liner (14) of flexible sheet 
material, such as air bag material, has a rim portion 

(68) adapted to be attached to the support frame and a 
side wall portion (74) suspended from the support 

frame (12) and reaching between the spaced apart inflator 
supports (42,44) whereby upon actuation of the inflator (16), the 

inflation gas is contained by the liner (14) and exhausted 
through the open mouth. A heat shield (90) of sheet 

metal is mounted on the side wall portion of the liner 
(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle air bags. It is well known to provide an air bag 
module mounted within the instrument panel structure. 
The air bag module includes a housing which mounts an 
inflator actuable to produce inflation gas for 
inflating an air bag mounted on the housing. The 
housing is conventionally of stamped sheet metal 
construction and includes a U-shaped cross section 
defined by side walls and end walls which connect the 
side walls. A hole is conventionally provided in one 
of the end walls to permit the insertion of a 
cylindrically shaped inflator into the housing. The 
housing typically includes a flange extending around 
the side walls and end walls at the upper margin 
thereof by which the module may be conveniently 
attached to the instrument panel structure. A problem 
of this known air bag modules that the sheet metal 
housing is heavy and adds to the weight of the 
vehicle. The present invention provides a new and 
improved air bag module of lightweight construction. In particular, the air bag module includes a 
rectangular support frame defining an open mouth for 
the mounting of an air bag and having spaced apart 
opposing end walls and spaced apart opposing side 
walls. An inflator support depends from each of the 
end walls of the rectangular support frame to support 
the inflator beneath the support frame. A liner of 
flexible sheet material, such as air bag material, has 
a rim portion adapted for attachment to the support 
frame and a side wall portion suspended from the 
support frame and reaching between the spaced apart 
inflator supports whereby upon actuation of the 
inflator, the inflation gas is contained by the liner  
 
and exhausted through the open mouth. A heat shield 
of thin gauge metal is located within the liner to 
space the liner away from the inflator. The heat 
shield may be of corrugated sheet metal. The invention will now be described by way 
of example, with reference to the appended drawings in 
which: 
Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of 
an air bag module according to the invention; Figure 2 shows the air bag module of Figure 
1 fully assembled for installation in a vehicle; and Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 1 but 
showing a second embodiment of the invention. Referring to Figure 1, it is seen the 
components of the improved air bag module of this 
invention include a support 12, a fabric liner 14, a 
conventional inflator 16, an air bag assembly 18 
including a folded air bag 20, plastic cover 22 and a 
sheet metal

<CLAIMS>
An air bag module for a motor vehicle, 
comprising: a cylindrical inflator (16) having spaced 

apart end walls and a cylindrical side wall; a support 
frame (12) defining an open mouth for the mounting of 

an air bag and having spaced apart opposing end walls 
(36,38) and spaced apart opposing side walls (32,34); 

an inflator support (42,44) depending from each of the 
end wall
s to support the inflator beneath the support 
frame and being spaced away from one another; a liner 

(14) of flexible sheet material having a rim portion 
(68) adapted for attachment to the support frame and 

having a side wall portion (74) suspended from the 
support frame and reaching between the spaced apart 

inflator supports whereby upon actuation of the 
inflator the inflation gas is contained by the liner 

and exhausted through the open mouth to inflate the 
air bag, and a heat shield (90) of sheet metal mounted 

on the side wall portion of the liner to shield the 
flexible sheet material of the liner from the 

inflator. 
The air bag module of claim 1 further 
characterised by the heat shield being of corrugated 

sheet metal so that the corrugations assure a space 
between the liner and the inflator. 
The air bag module of claim 2 further 
characterised by the heat shield attached to the liner 

by sewn threads 94 and 96.
