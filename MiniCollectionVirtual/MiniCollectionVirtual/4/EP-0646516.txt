<ABSTRACT>
A chassis (frame) for a vehicle, especially for a motor vehicle, is described, characterised in that it comprises a non-deformable basic frame (2), and two, front and rear, absorption zones (4,6) which are associated with the said frame (2) and in that the said frame (2) and the said absorption zones (4, 6) have a single-piece cellular structure.

<CLAIMS>
Chassis (1) for vehicle, notably for motor vehicle,
including :


a rigid base frame (2) comprising two beams (8, 8')
which extend substantially parallel to the rolling axis (OX)

of said chassis and which are linked together by a front
beam (10, 12', 14) and a rear beam (10', 12, 14'), and
two pairs of parallel front and rear side members
(16, 16', 18, 18') associated with said frame (2) and which

extend substantially parallel to the rolling axis (OX) of
the chassis, characterized in that the chassis (1) has a

cell-like unitary structure (20) along the yaw axis (OZ) of
said chassis and in that the side members (16, 16', 18, 18')

comprise front and rear absorption zones (4, 6), with a
cell-like structure p
rogressively able to be deformed in the
case of shocks to avoid the rigid base frame (2) to be

deformed.
Chassis for vehicle according to claim 1, characterized
in that the cells (20) forming the base frame (2)

and the side members (16, 16', 18, 18') are oriented to
exhibit high torsion and flexion rigidity characteristics in

relation to the rolling axis (OX) and the pitching axis (OY)
of the chassis (1).
Chassis for vehicle according to claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the cells (20) have a triangular or

quadrilateral section.
Chassis for vehicle according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the base frame (2) has a general

octagonal form.
Chassis for vehicle according to one of claims 1 to
4, characterized in that the walls (22, 24) of the cells

(20) of the side members (16, 16', 18, 18') are arranged in
such a way that said side members exhibit a ability to be

deformed which decreases the closer they are to the base
frame (2).
Chassis for vehicle according to one of claims 1 to
4, characterized in that each connecting zone (C) of a side 

member (16, 16', 18, 18') with the base frame (2) comprises
at least two cells (20c) having a common wall (22c) which

extends substantially parallel to the rolling axis (OX) of
the chassis and the walls (24c) open out towards the base

frame (2).
Chassis for vehicle according to one of claims 1 to
6, characterized in that certain of the cells (20c) forming

the chassis comprise organs for receiving functional
elements.
Chassis according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it is made of an aluminium alloy

extruded along the yaw axis (OZ) of said chassis.
