<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention a vehicle has a 
panel (16) with an opening (22) through which an air 

bag (29) is deployed. An air bag deployment door (24) 
closes the opening (22) in the panel (16). Upon air 

bag deployment, the door (24) is forcibly moved out of 
the opening (22) from a closed position (A) towards an 

open position by the deploying air bag (29). A hinge 
for the deployment door (24) includes a door hinge 

element (35) carried by the door (24), and a vehicle 
hinge element (36) carried by the vehicle. The 

separate hinge elements have co-operating 
hinge-forming features (40,42) which are spaced apart 

from one another when the door (24) is in the closed 
position. Upon air bag deployment, the door (24) 

begins to lift out of the opening (22) and carries the 
door hinge element (35) into engagement with the 

vehicle hinge element (36) to hingedly interconnect 
the co-operating hinge-forming features (40,42), 

thereby anchoring the door (24) to the vehicle and 
limiting further movement of the door (24) to rotation 

thereof about an axis defined by the hinge elements 
(35,36). In accordance with this invention, one of 

the hinge elements (35,36) may include a hooked leg 
(40) while the other hinge element (36) may include an 

apertured leg (42). The hook (41) and aperture (45) 
provide co-operating hinge-forming features that form 

a hinged interconnection upon air bag deployment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vehicle having an 
air bag according to the preamble of claim 1, 
particularly to a hinge for an air bag deployment door 
in an instrument panel cover and more particularly to 
an improved hinge that extends between the door and 
vehicle structure to anchor the door to the vehicle 
during air bag deployment without requiring access 
underneath the instrument panel cover to fasten the 
hinge to the vehicle structure during installation 
into the vehicle. It is well known in motor vehicles to have 
an instrument panel assembly which consists of an 
instrument panel cover attached to rigid underlying 
vehicle structure. It is also well known to mount an 
air bag to the underlying vehicle structure for 
deployment through an air bag deployment opening 
provided in the instrument panel cover. The opening 
in the instrument panel cover is conventionally closed 
by an air bag deployment door secured in a closed 
position to conceal the undeployed air bag from view. 
The door is hingedly mounted so that the deploying air 
bag forcibly moves the door out of the opening from 
the closed position towards an open position to permit 
the deployment of the air bag through the opening. It 
is known in the prior art that the hinge for the 
deployment door may be a flexible or elastic strap, or 
a metal strap. In some cases, the deployment door hinge 
extends between the deployment door and the instrument 
panel cover. Thus, the instrument panel cover 
provides support for the hinge to anchor the door to 
the vehicle during air bag deployment. This 
arrangement is convenient since the hinge can be 
sub-assembled and fastened to the instrument panel  
 
cover and deployment door before installation of the 
instrument panel cover into the vehicle. In other cases, it is desirable for the 
hinge to extend between the deployment door and the 
more rigid vehicle structure underlying the instrument 
panel cover to anchor the door to the vehicle during 
air bag deployment. However, a disadvantage of this 
arrangement is that access is required underneath the 
instrument panel cover during installation of the 
deployment door into the vehicle to fasten the hinge 
to the vehicle structure. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a new 
and improved hinge which would extend between the 
deployment door and vehicle structure to anchor the 
door to the vehicle during air bag deployment without 
requiring access underneath the instrument panel cover 
to fasten the hinge to the vehicle structure during 
instal
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle having a cover (16;116;216) 
with an opening (22) through which an air bag (29) is 

deployable, and a door (24;124;224) closing the 
opening (22), which door is forcibly moved out of the 

opening (22) from a closed position (A) towards an 
open position by the deployment of the air bag (29), 

characterised in that the vehicle includes a door 
hinge element (35;135;235) carried by the door 

(24;124;224), and a vehicle hinge element (36;136;236) 
carried by the vehicle, said hinge elements having 

co-operating hinge-forming features 
(40,42;140,142;240,242) spaced apart from one another 

when the door (24;124;224) is in the closed position 
(A), and said door hinge element (35;135;235) being 

carried by the door (24;124;224) into engagement with 
said vehicle hinge element (36;136;236) during 

deployment of the air bag (29), causing the 
co-operating hinge-forming features 

(40,42;140,142;240,242) to hingedly interconnect with 
one another and to anchor the door (24;124;224) to the 

vehicle whereby further movement of the door 
(24;124;224) towards the open position is limited to 

the door (24;124;224) rotating about an axis defined 
by said hinge elements (35,36;135,136;235,236). 
A vehicle according to claim 1, in which 
the door hinge element comprises a door strap (30) 

carried by the door (24), which strap (30) has a first 
leg (31) underlying and attached to the door (24) and 

a second leg (32) extending from the first leg (31), 
said door strap (30) being bendable about a bending 

axis defined by a folded intersection of said first 
and second legs, and a door hinge element (35) carried 

by the second leg (32) of the door strap (30), and 
said further movement of the door (24) towards the 

 
open position is limited to the door (24) rotating 

about said axis defined by said hinge elements (35,36) 
and bending about said bending axis defined by said 

door strap (30). 
A vehicle according to claim 1, in which 
the door hinge element (35;135;235) has a mounting leg 

(37) attached to the door (24;124;224) and an engaging 
leg (40;140;240) extending from the mounting leg (37); 

the vehicle hinge element (36;136;236) has a vehicle 
leg (43;243) attached to the vehicle and an engaging 

leg (42;142;242) extending from the vehicle leg 
(43;243), said engaging leg (42;142;242) of the 

vehicle hinge element (36;136;236) overlapping and 
being spaced above said engaging leg (40;140;240) of 

the door hinge element (35;135;235) when the door 
(24;124;224) is in the closed position (A); and one of 

said engaging legs (40,42;140,142;240,242) has an 
aperture (45) and the other has a hook (41), whereby, 

upon air bag deployment, said engaging leg 
(40;140;240) of the door hinge element (35;135;235) is 

carried by the door (24;124;224) into engagement with 
said engaging leg (42;142;242) of the vehicle hinge 

element (36;136;236) so as to hingedly interconnect 
and anchor the door (24;124;224) to the vehicle, 

limiting further movement of the door (24;124;224) 
towards the open position to rotation thereof about 

said axis defined by said hinge elements 
(35,36;135,136;235,236).
