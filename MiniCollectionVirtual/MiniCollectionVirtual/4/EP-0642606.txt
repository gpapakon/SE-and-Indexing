<ABSTRACT>
A process and devices are disclosed for operating twisting spindles. In twisting machines with several twisting spindles, the passage of the thread (F2) through the balloon of thread limited by limiting elements (3) is influenced so that each live thread element touches the limiting elements at time intervals that satisfy the following conditions: (a) the ratio between the sum of the contact times of each live thread element with the limiting elements (3) and the total time of passage of said thread element through the balloon of thread is comprised between 1:5 and 1:200; (b) the ratio between the contact time of a thread element and the following non-contact time is comprised between 1:2 and 1:20. In a device for carrying out the process, an ondulating ring (6) is arranged between the upper edge of a balloon limiter (3) and the guide ring (2) in such a way that it is touched at its inner or outer side by the live thread (F2). The side of the ondulating ring (6) touched by the thread has at its circumference cams with a sinus-shaped profile. The ondulating ring forms transverse waves in the length of thread inside the balloon of thread which have such a wavelength that conditions (a) and (b) are satisfied.

Method for operating twisting spindles with the formation 
of a balloon of thread whose radial extent is limited by 

the inner surface of a cylindrical balloon limiter, in the 
case of which each circulating thread element of the thread 

running through the balloon of thread comes into contact 
with the inner surface of the balloon limiter at intervals 

and then runs through a thread guide eyelet, 
characterized in that the course of the thread through the 

thread balloon is periodically disturbed from a point in 
the region between the upper edge of the balloon limiter 

and the thread guide eyelet in such a way that transverse 
waves are formed over the length of the thread within 

the balloon of thread with such a wave length that the 
following conditions are met: 


a) the sum of the contact times of each thread element 
running through the balloon of thread with the balloon 

limiter and the total transit time of this thread 
element through the balloon of thread are in a ratio of 

1:5 to 1:200; 
b) each contact time of a thread element of the 
circulating thread and the subsequent time of non-contact 

are in a ratio of 1:2 to 1:20. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
wave length of the transverse waves is in such a ratio to 

the length of the thread within the balloon of thread that 
a stationary wave is formed within the balloon of thread.  

 
Apparatus for implementing the method according to Claim 
1, on a twisting machine with at least one twisting spindle 

(Z), above which a thread guide eyelet (2) is located for 
the thread (F2) running round and forming a balloon of 

thread in operation and which is surrounded by a 
cylindrically formed balloon limiter (3), characterized 

in that, in the region of the balloon of thread between 
the upper edge of the balloon limiter (3) and the thread 

guide eyelet (2), an undulator ring (6, 16, 36, 46) is 
located so that it is in contact on the inside or outside 

with the thread (F2, F1.2, F42) running round in the 
balloon of thread, whereby the side of the undulator ring 

in contact with the thread has, at least over one part of 
its circumference, a structure which diverges in radial 

direction in predetermined fashion from the circular form 
in such a way that the course of the thread through the 

thread balloon is periodically disturbed from a point in 
the region between the upper edge of the balloon limiter 

and the thread guide eyelet in such a way that transverse 
waves are formed over the length of the thread within the 

thread balloon with such a wave length that the following 
conditions are met: 


a) the sum of the contact times of each thread element 
running through the thread balloon with the balloon 

limiter and the total transit time of this thread 
element through the thread balloon are in a ratio of 

1:5 to 1:200; 
b) each contact time of a thread element of the 
circulating thread and the subsequent time of 

non-contact are in a ratio of 1:2 to 1:20. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
structure diverging from the circular form is formed as 

a structure running periodically over the circumference.  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in that the 
side of the undulator ring (46) in contact with the thread 

(F2) is formed as a regular polygon. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in that the 
side of the undulator ring (6, 16, 36, 46) in contact with 

the thread (F2) is provided on the circumference with 
cams (6.2, 16.2) of at least roughly sinusoidal outline. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in that the 
amplitude of the cam outline amounts to 2-10 mm. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in that the 
cams (6.2) are located on the inside of an undulator ring 

(6) encircling the thread balloon and the radial distance 
between cam peaks (6.2) lying roughly opposite one another 

amounts to 40 - 150 mm, whilst the distance between cam 
valleys (6.3) lying opposite one another amounts to 50 - 

160 mm.
