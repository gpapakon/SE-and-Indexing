<ABSTRACT>
A self-sounding tag alarm apparatus having a tag 
type main body attached to a commodity and automatically 

operable to sound an alarm when an attempt is made 
to steal the commodity. The apparatus includes a 

coupling such as a wire, pin or the like for detachably 
attaching the main apparatus body to the commodity, an 

alarm generator mounted in the main apparatus body, a 
detector for detecting a signal of a particular frequency 

produced externally of the main apparatus body 
and removal of the coupling, a reset signal intake 

device for taking into the main apparatus body a reset 
signal applied externally of the main apparatus body, 

and an alarm control device for rendering the alarm 
generator operative based on a detection signal received 

from the detector, and rendering the alarm 
generator inoperative based on the reset signal received 

from the reset signal intake device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alarm apparatus 
for use in a shoplift preventive system or the 
like. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
self-sounding tag alarm apparatus having a tag type 
body attached to a commodity and automatically operable 
to sound an alarm when an attempt is made to steal the 
commodity. Conventionally, this type of self-sounding tag 
alarm apparatus is used in a shoplift preventive system 
employing a detector having a gate (antenna) of the 
electromagnetic induction coupling type or the like. In the shoplift preventive system, the self-sounding 
tag alarm apparatus is attached to a commodity, 
e.g. an article of clothing, by means of a wire, pin, 
adhesive tape or the like, and placed in a salesroom. 
When a shoplifter, in an attempt to take the commodity 
without paying, passes through a gate adjacent a 
cashier's counter, the self-sounding tag alarm apparatus 
attached to the commodity receives an electromagnetic 
wave of a particular frequency from the gate.  
 
Then, the alarm apparatus resonates with the electromagnetic 
wave, and sounds an alarm. If a shoplifter 
removes the self-sounding tag alarm apparatus from the 
commodity before walking off with the commodity, the 
alarm apparatus detects detachment of the wire or the 
like and gives an alarm. In a proper shopping action, a cashier removes the 
self-sounding tag alarm apparatus from the commodity 
after canceling the detecting mechanism of the alarm 
apparatus. Thus, no alarm is given in this case. This 
canceling operation is carried out mechanically with an 
alarm cancel key or a special jig. The conventional alarm apparatus constructed as 
described above has the following disadvantage. In the conventional apparatus, the mechanically 
operable alarm cancel key is inserted into a keyhole, 
or the special jig is fitted, to cancel the alarm by 
mechanically stopping the internal detecting mechanism. 
This alarm canceling operation is very troublesome, and 
tends to retard an accounting process. The present invention has been made having regard 
to the state of the art noted above, and its object is 
to provide a self-sounding tag alarm apparatus which  
 
facilitates an alarm canceling operation to present no 
obstruction to an accounting process. The above object is fulfilled, according to the 
present invention, by a self-sounding tag alarm apparatus 
for use on a commodity to prevent shoplifting, the 
apparatus comprising:
 
   coupling means for detachably attaching a main 
apparatus body to
