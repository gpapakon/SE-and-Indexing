<ABSTRACT>
The voice control of a hands-free door telephone arrangement with telephones connected to a switching facility and a door station equipped with a loudspeaker and with a microphone, in which the door loudspeaker is preceded by an amplifier and the door microphone is followed by a preamplifier, which are associated with attenuating stages in each case alternatingly controlled via further amplifiers allocated to their two circuits for the purpose of voice control, is to be improved with relatively few and inexpensive components in such a manner that their further separate voice control improves the communication capabilities and virtually eliminates acoustic feedback. For this purpose, it is proposed that digitally controllable analog switches are provided as attenuating stages.
