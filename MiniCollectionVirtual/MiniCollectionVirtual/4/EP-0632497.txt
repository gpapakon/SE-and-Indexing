<DESCRIPTION>
The multichip module (MCM) approach to interconnection and 
packaging employs unpackaged, naked die mounted onto a high 
interconnection density substrate structure, with the resulting 
assembly then packaged to form a module. This removal of the 
individual die packaging overhead allows very close die proximity 
(from 0.4 to 2mm die spacings typical) and a high functional density 
to be achieved. This technology also provides a considerable area 
and weight saving over the equivalent circuit function realised 
using individually packaged ICs and surface mount assembly. 
Typical area savings of between 5 and 10 fold at the substrate level 
may be achieved. The area fraction of functional silicon in this 
technology when measured at the substrate level is a function of the 
assembly method employed. For wire bonded modules this area 
fraction is typically 30 to 60 per cent, while flip chip solder 
bonded module assemblies can provide area fractions of up to 80 per 
cent. Improvements in reliability are also achieved through the 
elimination of package leads, solder joints and other materials 
interfaces in the transition from individual to multichip packaging. 
Performance improvements are achieved through the elimination of 
individual device package parasitics and the typically three fold 
reduction in inter-device trace lengths. A number of categories of MCM technology have now been 
defined, describing the type of substrate structure employed to 
interconnect the naked die in the MCM assembly. The MCM-L category  
 
uses very fine line, multilayer printed circuit board (pcb) 
substrate structures that are fabricated using extensions of 
existing pcb manufacturing techniques. Such substrates are suited 
for interconnect only, all digital modules with low or medium power 
dissipation and medium wiring density demand (i.e. medium device pin 
count). They offer the lowest cost per unit area of the MCM 
substrate alternatives and employ typically up to 6 metal and 
dielectric layers. The MCM-C category uses cofired, multilayer 
ceramic technologies to provide the required interconnection 
structure. Since the track geometries in this technology are 
commonly defined by screen printing, which implies limited 
resolution, the required routing density is achieved by employing 
additional layers in the multilayer substrate structure. MCM-C 
modules with up to 40 layers have been reported. The MCM-C 
substrate structure may be readily incorporated with the module 
package structure to provide a reliable, cost
