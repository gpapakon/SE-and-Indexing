<ABSTRACT>
A base fabric for press felts and a press felt incorporating that base fabric which includes an assembly of three or more separately woven fabric layers (10, 20, 30). Each of the woven fabric layers making up the base fabric assembly is a single or multilayer fabric, and they may be of the same or different weave patterns. The three or more fabric layers (10, 20, 30) are assembled, one above the other and needled together with at least one batt layer on the papermaking surface of the felt. Preferably, the yarns on the top surface of the top fabric (10) will, by virtue of the weave of the fabric, have long floats in the machine and/or cross machine direction to provide good paper web support. The bottom (30) and intermediate fabric (20) layers may also have long cross machine direction floats on their top surfaces to support the fabric or fabrics above. In a preferred embodiment, the yarns (11, 12) making up the top fabric layer (10) will be relatively finer than those making up the intermediate layer (21, 22) and similarly, the yarns making up the intermediate layer will be relatively finer than those making up the bottom fabric layer (31, 32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to papermakers' fabrics and
especially to papermaking felts for the press section of a
papermaking machine.In the conventional fourdrinier papermaking process, a
water slurry or suspension of cellulose fibers, known as the
paper "stock", is fed onto the top of the upper run of a
traveling endless forming belt. The forming belt provides a
papermaking surface and operates as a filter to separate the
cellulosic fibers from the aqueous medium to form a wet
paper web. In forming the paper web, the forming belt
serves as a filter element to separate the aqueous medium
from the cellulosic fibers by providing for the drainage of
the aqueous medium through its mesh openings, also known as
drainage holes, by vacuum means or the like located on the
drainage side of the fabric.After leaving the forming medium, the somewhat
self-supporting paper web is transferred to the press
section of the machine and onto a press felt, where still 
more of its water content is removed by passing it through a
series of pressure nips formed by cooperating press rolls,
these press rolls serving to compact the web as well.Subsequently, the paper web is transferred to a dryer
section where it is passed about and held in heat transfer
relation with a series of heated, generally cylindrical
rolls to remove still further amounts of water therefrom.In general, the press felts in the press section are
used in papermaking machinery to support the moist, freshly
formed paper web as it encounters a variety of rolls to
extract water from the moist paper web. In addition to
serving as a support for the moist paper web, the press felt
serves as a receptacle for the water removed from the paper
sheet. Preferably, the press felts are woven so as to have
relatively large open areas or voids which will enhance
their water-conveying capabilities until the water is
removed from the felt upon passage over a suction box or
other drainage device. The press felt normally has a
conveyer belt-like shape and during the various operations
previously mentioned, a large amount of water is built up in
the press felt which is removed by suction or various other
drainage devices, usually after the paper web and press felt
are no longer in direct contact.A papermakers' fabric is known, for example, from US-A-4 435 392,
the fabric being constructed from a ground fabric composed of a
separate upper and lower fabric, needled fibre belts being provided
throughout the fabric. Paper sheet dewatering, sheet surface smoothness, sheet
pick-up and
