<ABSTRACT>
A flat balance forms a wheel load measuring device for the wheels of road vehicles. It has a flat weighing plate (1) in the shape of a circular disc. The weighing plate (1) is connected at its periphery via an internal circular bending joint (flector) (2) having a concentric bending ring (3). The bending ring (3) is supported on the edge of a disc-shaped balance lower part (8) via an outer circular bending joint (6). On the underside (4) of the bending ring (3) and in the vicinity of the plane of the neutral fibre (9) of the weighing plate (1), strain gauges (5, 11), which are counterconnected in a full bridge circuit, are applied in each case. As a result, a compensation of the fault influences caused by the sagging of the weighing plate (1) is achieved.

Flat scales, in particular wheel load scales for the wheels of road vehicles having a
flat weighing plate (1) which absorbs the load, said weighing plate being supported

along its edge by deformation elements fitted with wire strain gauges (5, 11), against a
lower section of the scales, characterised in that the weighing plate (1) has the shape

of a circular disc, that the weighing plate (1) is connected along its circumference to a
concentric bending ring (3) by way of an intemal, circular flector (2), said bending

ring being supported along the edge of the disc-shaped lower section of the scales (8,
8', 8") by way of an external circular flector (6), that at least two wire strain gauges

(5 or 11) are fitted to the underside (4) of the bending ring (3) and to the underside of
the weighing plate (1), in each case distributed around the circumference, and that the

wire strain gauges (5, 11) are connected back to back in a full bridge circuit (12).
Flat scales, according to claim 1, characterised in that the wire strain gauge
(11) is fitted to the underside of the weighing plate (1) close to the plane of the neutral

axis (9). 
Flat scales, according to claim 2, characterised in that the weighing plate (1)
has, along its circumference, an annular surface (10) facing downwards and lying

close to the plane of the neutral axis (9), said annular surface supporting one wire
strain gauge (11).
Flat scales, according to claim 1, characterised in that the weighing plate (1)
has, along its circumference, an annular surface (10') facing downwards and situated

at the same level as the lower side (4) of the bending ring (3), said annular surface
supporting one wire strain gauge (11).
Flat scales, according to claim 1, characterised in that the wire strain gauges
(5, 11) comprise strain gauge wires wound spirally around the entire circumference.
Flat scales, according to claim 1, characterised in that the inner flector (2) rests
on the top side of the weighing plate (1).
Flat scales according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer flector (6) is
situated at a distance above the lower side (4) of the bending ring (3), said lower side

supporting the wire strain gauge (5).
Flat scales according to claim 1, characterised in that the weighing plate (1),
the inner flector (2), the bending ring (3), the outer flector (6) and a bearing ring (7,

7') extending to the circumference of the lower section of the scales (8, 8', 8") are
designed as one piece.
Flat scales according to claim 1, characterised in that the weighing plate (1),
the inner flector (2), the bending ring (3), the outer flector (6) and a bearing ring (7,

7') extending to the circumference of the lower section of the scales (5, 8', 8")
together with the disc-shaped lower section of the scales (8, 8', 8") form a

hermetically sealed, flat cell. 
Flat scales according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer flector (6) is
supported by the edge of the lower section of the scales (8', 8") by way of a bearing

ring (7') having a circumferential knife-edge (17).
Flat scales according to claim 10, characterised in that the circumferential
knife-edge (17) rests approximately on the same diameter as the outer flector (6).
Flat scales according to claim 10, characterised in that the bearing ring (7') is
sealed against the lower section of the scales (8', 8") by at least one flexible sealing

ring (18, 19).
Flat scales according to any of the claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the
lower section of the scales (8") comprises a ring (21) forming the edge and a thin-walled

middle plate (22), which is connected at its mid point, to the weighing plate
(1).
