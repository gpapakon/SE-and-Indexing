<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for compensating temperature-dependent 
volumetric changes in a waveguide, characterized in 

that the waveguide (1) is clamped in at least one frame 
(2, 3, 4, 5) whose temperature-dependent expansion is 

smaller than that of the waveguide (1), in that the 
waveguide (1) is joined to the frame (2, 3, 4, 5) in a 

force-closed fashion at at least two mutually opposite 
points of its wall, and in that the force-closed joints 

between the frame (2, 3, 4, 5) and waveguide (1) are made 
by distance pieces (8, 9) which transmit compressive or 

tensile forces, resulting from a differential thermal 
expansion between the frame (2, 3, 4, 5) and 

waveguide (1), onto the waveguide wall and cause deformations 
there. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the distance pieces are constructed as 

ribs (8, 9) which are arranged outside on the waveguide 
wall. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the waveguide (1) consists of aluminium, and at 

least parts of the frame (2, 3, 4, 5) consist of invar. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the waveguide (1) is clamped in a plurality of 

frames (2, 3, 4, 5) which are arranged distributed along 
its longitudinal axis and oriented transverse thereto. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the frame (2, 3, 4, 5) comprises two 

struts (2, 3) which are screwed to one another at their 
ends via spacers (4, 5). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized  
 

in that stiffening elements (10, 11) are provided in the 
wall regions of the waveguide (1) which are not joined to 

the frame (2, 3, 4, 5) in a force-closed fashion. 
Arrangement according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by its use in a frequency 

multiplexer/demultiplexer, comprising a collective 
waveguide to which a plurality of bandpass filters tuned 

to different frequencies are coupled at the side.
