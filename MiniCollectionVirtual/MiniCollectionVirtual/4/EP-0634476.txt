<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cleaning compositions.
More particularly, the cleaning compositions according to
the present invention are stable aqueous emulsions of
nonionic surfactants which comprise a viscosity control
agent.A great variety of cleaning compositions have been
described in the art. For instance, in EP-A-0 598 170,
a particular type of
cleaning compositions is described which are aqueous
emulsions of a nonionic surfactant system. Such emulsions 
find a preferred application in the formulation of
bleaching compositions comprising hydrogen peroxide or
water soluble sources thereof and a liquid hydrophobic
bleach activator, or any other hydrophobic ingredient which
needs to be separated from hydrogen peroxide.Alternatively, such emulsions can be used to formulate
products which do not contain hydrogen peroxide. In the
latter case, such emulsions can be useful because they
allow to keep a given hydrophobic ingredient separate from
the aqueous phase, with which said hydrophobic ingredient
could react, e.g., by hydrolysis.It is also generally desirable to be able to efficiently
control the viscosity of cleaning compositions. Indeed,
viscosity is an essential aspect of cleaning compositions
in relation to ease of pouring and dispensing, and
spreadability. This latter aspect is particularly
important when cleaning compositions are used to clean hard
surfaces, especially on inclined or vertical surfaces such
as toilet bowls, or in the context of laundry. In those
instances, the cleaning compositions must be thick enough
for a controlled application onto fabrics, and for a good
cling onto surfaces.It is thus an object of the present invention to formulate
aqueous emulsions of nonionic surfactants wherein the
viscosity can be easily controlled.A variety of thickening agents or hydrotrope compounds or
hydrotropes are available for this purpose. By thickening
agent or hydrotrope compounds, it is meant herein compounds
whose sole function is to regulate the viscosity of the
compositions. Such compounds are however rather
undesirable for a variety of reasons. Indeed, they can
significantly increase formula cost without participating
to the overall cleaning performance, they may involve 
processing and safety issues, they may affect product
stability, particularly in extreme acidic conditions, and
they may affect the cleaning performance of the
compositions.It is thus an object of the present invention to formulate
such a composition without having to use a thickener or
hydrotrope compound.It has now
