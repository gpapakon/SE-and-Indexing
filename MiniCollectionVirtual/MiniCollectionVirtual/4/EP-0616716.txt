<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to identification of 
elongate objects using indicia wherein a mark is both 
rendered permanent and protected using an optically clear 
means of attachment. It is frequently necessary to identify components in 
electrical assemblies, particularly where a multiplicity 
of wires and/or cables need to be identified. Various 
marking systems for wire cables and the like are known in 
the art. Wires and cables have been identified by impressing 
characters into the insulation surrounding the wire. 
This has the disadvantage of possible damage to the 
insulation. Early attempts to create permanent marking 
assemblies employed plastic tubes which slip over the 
cable. These may be loose or may use heat-shrink 
technology as disclosed in U.S. 3,894,731. However, 
these assemblies require application during installation, 
since they must be slipped onto or over an unterminated 
wire. This limits any marking of already installed 
cable, or redesignation. Later, heat-shrink sleeves were formed as wrap-around 
versions, which employed strips of heat-shrink 
film. It is necessary to secure the final "wrap" to 
prevent the formation of a free end. This is known in 
the industry as flagging. However, both tubular and 
wrap-around shrink sleeves employ radial shrinkage. The 
identification is usually printed or typed onto the 
article, and rendered permanent by a heat treatment. 
This is referred to as "permatization", and may be 
accomplished by heating in an oven or subjecting to 
infrared radiation. This is expensive, and may not be 
effective for elongate articles which are dark in color.  
 U.S. 4,569,759, (Brewers) discloses an adhesive tape 
construction used for identification markers to be 
applied to wire cables or switch structures. pressure-sensitive 
adhesive layer is applied to the lower surface 
of a transparent substrate, which has an opaque ink-receptive 
area. The tape is cut into individual strips 
which are adhesively attached side-by-side on a release 
carrier material. The information is inscribed on the 
ink-receptive area. The marker strip is then removed 
from the release liner by peeling back the tape, and 
applied by attaching the head section to the wire and 
wrapping it upon itself so that the width dimension of 
the tape becomes the length of the marker. Multiple 
layers of strips may be arranged upon one another. U.S. Patent 4,465,717, (Crofts et al.) discloses a 
means for marking elongate objects in which a carrier 
supports a strip of marking material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A die-cut permanent marking article for use with an 
elongate object, consisting of a strip of low molecular 

weight heat-sensitive, transparent polymeric film 
having an upper and a lower surface, at least a portion 

of the lower surface being coated with a pressure 
sensitive adhesive capable of self-adherence, at least 

a portion of the upper surface being coated with an 
opaque imprintable layer, said transparent polymeric 

film extending beyond said opaque layer such that a 
portion of the strip appears opaque, and a portion of 

the strip appears transparent, said polymeric film 
being fusible by the application of heat, said polymeric 

film remaining transparent even after application 
of heat such that any marking placed on the opaque 

coating of the article remains readable even if covered 
by one or more overwrapping portions of said strip. 
A permanent marking article according to claim 1 
wherein said transparent polymeric film is selected 

from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, 
polyallomers, ethylene vinyl acetate, copolymers 

thereof, and mixtures thereof. 
A permanent marking article according to claim 2 
wherein said film further comprises a hydrogenated 

rosin ester tackifier. 
A kit comprising a multiplicity of permanent marking 
articles according to claim 1 releaseably attached to 

a liner, said kit further comprising a detaching means 
for easily removing said articles from said liner.  

 
A kit according to claim 4 wherein said detaching means 
for each permanent marking article comprises a handling 

tab formed by cut or partially cut lines in said 
release liner, wherein the polymeric strip overlays at 

least a portion of such tab, so that removal of the tab 
from the release liner results in removal of the strip 

from the release liner. 
A method for placing a permanent identification article 
on a elongate object comprising the steps of: 


a) providing a permanent marking article according 
to claim 1, 
b) imprinting said opaque imprintable portion of said 
upper surface to form an imprinted area, 
c) overwrapping said strip longitudinally around said 
elongate object until said trailing end of said 

strip is wrapped around the elongate article onto 
a previous wrap, said imprintable portion being 

overwrapped at least once, until a trailing end 
is reached. 
d) temporarily self-adhering said trailing end to 
said previous wrap, 
e) heating said strip until said overwraps are at 
least partially fused to provide a tubular 

structure. 
A method according to claim 6 wherein said opaque 
imprintable portion of said permanent marking article 

covers 25% of said polymeric strip. 
A marked elongate object having a permanent marking 
article thereon, according to claim 1, said article  

 
being a seamless, tubular article wrapped longitudinally 

around said elongate object, at least a 
portion thereof being an opaque imprinted area, said 

portion having been overwrapped by transparent 
polymeric film such that said film provides protection 

for said imprinted area, said imprinted area being 
clearly readable, said article having been at least 

partially fused by the application of heat.
