<ABSTRACT>
In a SIMD architecture having a two-dimensional array of 
processing elements (10), where a controller broadcasts instructions 

to all processing elements (10) in the array, a dynamically 
reconfigurable switching means (14) useful to connect four of 

the processing elements (10) in the array into a group in 
accordance with either the broadcast instruction of the controller 

or a special communication instruction held in one 
processing element (10) of the group is provided. The switch 

(14) includes at least one data line (54) connected to each 
processing element (10) in the group. A multiplexer is connected 

to each data line (54) and to the controller and to a configuration 
register. It is adapted to load the special communication 

instruction from the one processing element (10) in the 
group into a configuration register and to operate in accord 

with either the broadcast instruction from the controller or 
the contents of the configuration register to select one of 

the four data lines (54) as a source of data and applying the 
data therefrom to a source output port. A demultiplexer is 

connected to each data line (54) and to the controller and to 
said configuration register, and to the source output port of 

the multiplexer means, and adapted to operate in accord with 
either the broadcast instruction from the controller or the 

contents of the configuration register to select one of the 
four data lines (54) as a source of data and applying the data 

therefrom to a selected data line (54). The switch (14) also 
acts to connect processing elements (10) that cross chip 

partitions forming the processor array. Up to four such switches 
(14) can be used to connect a group of four processing elements 

(10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to computer architectures, 
and, more particularly, to a dynamically reconfigurable switching 
means useful in connecting processing elements in processor 
arrays in SIMD multi-processor architectures. In processing arrays of processing elements found in SIMD 
multi-processor architectures, interprocessor communications 
connecting the eight nearest neighboring processing elements 
through four links per each processing element (PE) have been 
implemented in the X-net switch used in a commercially available 
machine (MasPar's MP-1), and in a university developed machine 
(BLITZEN at the University of North Carolina). However, none of 
these designs exhibit an ability for the dynamic 
reconfigurability of their switching units as is found in the 
present invention. In the literature, reconfigurable nearest neighbor 
communications in processing arrays have been described at a very 
high level in S.J.Tomboulian, A System for Routing Arbitrary 
Communication Graphs on SIMD Architectures, Ph.D. Dissertation,  
 
Duke University, 1986. However, this description is given in a 
general and abstract fashion with no implementation details. This invention describes a dynamically reconfigurable 
interprocessor communication network for dynamically controlling 
data flow between processing elements in processor arrays found 
in parallel Single Instruction stream Multiple Data stream (SIMD) 
computer architectures. Central to this invention is the design 
of a Dynamically Reconfigurable Switch (DRS) used to transfer 
data between neighboring processing Elements (PE) in a processing 
array. A number of important and novel architectural features 
are attained through the use of the present invention. These 
include: requiring a minimal number of interprocessor 
connections per PE and allowing for local communication autonomy 
at the level of each PE. The former is important from a physical 
implementation point of view, and the later is significant for 
adding a new dimension of flexibility to existing SIMD 
architectures. Dynamic reconfigurability of the processing elements in the 
processing array is achieved by associating with each PE a 
distinct DRS embodying the present invention. The configuration 
of the DRS, i.e., switch settings required to pass data from an 
input port to an output port, can be either set by the 
instructions received by all PEs (broadcast instructions) from 
the controller, or be independently set to a value stored locally 
in each PE's memory area.
