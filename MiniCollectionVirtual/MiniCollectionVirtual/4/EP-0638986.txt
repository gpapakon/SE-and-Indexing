<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit for converting input source energy into output load energy, for example a flyback converter for charging a storage capacitor for defibrilation from a low-voltage battery in an implantable defibrilator. The invention allows the input current to pass through the flyback inductor for a fixed duration and it allows the output current to pass for a duration which is directly proportional to the average voltage of the battery and inversely proportional to the voltage of the capacitor which is charged. When the invention is used in proximity to an electromagnetic communications system, a control circuit, in order to avoid interference, enables and inhibits the converter with a maximum frequency which is substantially below the operating frequency of the system. Moreover, the control circuit drives the converter in such a way that the cycles of energy transfer from the source to the storage capacitor take place at a minimum fundamental frequency which is substantially above the frequency of the system.
