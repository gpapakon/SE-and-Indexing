<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and
an apparatus for producing insulators. More particlarly,
the invention relates to a process and an apparatus
for producing an insulator having a rubbery housing
integrally formed around an outer periphery of a core.In order to increase an insulating distance
along a surface of the insulator, techniques are known
to provide a number of shed portions around cores.
As a process for forming a housing of rubber around an
outer periphery of a core in the production of the
insulator, a transfer molding process and an injection
molding process have been employed.Producing methods based on the transfer mold
process are disclosed in Japanese patent application
Laid-open Nos. 63-128,916 and 2-248,225. A molding
apparatus used in the transfer molding process is
constituted as shown in Fig. 1. A cavity 100 is defined
between an upper mold unit 101 and a lower mold unit and
lower mold units are closed. The cavity 100 has an inner 
peripheral surface for forming a sheath portion and
shade portions of a housing of an insulator. A heater
is provided in or for each of the upper and lower mold
units 101 and 102. Injection gates 103 are provided in
the upper mold unit 101 or the lower mold unit 102 (in
this case, the gates 103 are provided in the lower mold
units 101). A cylinder 104 is located under the lower
mold unit 102, and is provided with a press-in piston
105. A pot 106 is defined between the piston 105 and
the molds 101 and 102 inside the cylinder 104. Supports
108 are movable in a direction orthogonal to an axis of
the cavity 100 by cylinders 109, and are adapted to
support a core 107 in the cavity 100 on one side.In the transfer molding process, the core 107
made of an FRP (fiber-reinforced resin) is first set
inside the cavity 100 along the axis thereof. The core
107 is supported in this state by means of the supports
108. Then, a raw rubber composition is charged into the
pot 106, and softened there by heating. Next, the
softened rubber composition is fed into a space between
the core 107 and the inner peripheral surface of the
cavity 100 through the gates 103 by means of the piston
105. At that time, the core 107 is pressed by the raw
rubber composition. However, since the core 107 is
supported by the supports 108 on a side opposite to the
gates 103, the core is not bent or displaced. 
The rubber composition is heated at a given temperature
in the space defined by the inner periphery of the
cavity 100 and the outer periphery of the core for a
given time after the
