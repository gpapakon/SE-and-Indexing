<ABSTRACT>
A photographic lighting system for use with a camera 
provides fill light from the direction of the camera to 

alleviate shadows in a photographic image obtained by the 
camera. The photographic lighting system includes an 

incident light sensor for sensing the incident light 
intensity on a subject to be photographed, an electric 

light for directing fill light toward the subject, and a 
control circuit for controlling the intensity of the fill 

light provided by the electric light in response to the 
sensed incident light intensity. The fill light is 

increased in intensity as the incident light intensity 
increases. The control circuit can also receive a distance 

input representative of the distance between the electric 
light and the subject and controls the fill light in 

response to the distance input such that the fill light 
intensity at the subject is substantially independent of 

the distance. A sensitivity input to the control circuit 
permits the fill light intensity to be compensated for the 

sensitivity of the camera.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic lighting
system for use with a camera and, more particularly, to a
photographic lighting system wherein shadows are
alleviated by providing a fill light that increases in
intensity as the incident light intensity increases.Most indoor spaces that are designed for human
activity include artificial electric illumination to a
level of at least 323 candelas/m2 (30 footcandles), with most work areas
illuminated to 646 candelas/m2 (60 footcandles) or more. This level of
illumination is quite sufficient for all modern film and
video cameras, which can record an image with 108 cd/m2 (10
footcandles) or less. Video camera manufacturers often
encourage users to create video programs using nothing
more than the available illumination. The video images
thus created are usually quite unacceptable due to the
fact that the available illumination is almost always in
the form of ceiling or overhead lights. This type of
illumination creates shadows on the face, dark eye sockets
and black necks, and accentuates facial wrinkles.
Furthermore, the forehead, nose and shoulders are
significantly overbright and appear to be glowing. Thus,
the available overhead light is often unacceptable for
foreground subjects.The use of built-in light meters in automatic cameras
is well known. The iris of the camera is adjusted in
accordance with the output of the light meter to
compensate for factors such as film speed (camera
sensitivity), shutter speed, and scene illumination.
However, the shadowing problem described above is not
alleviated. A reflective light metering device has been
incorporated into lights for home video cameras. The
metering device determines the amount of light reflected
off the subject in order to increase the output of the
camera's onboard light in low light and to decrease the
output in bright light. This is usually accomplished by a
variable resistance in series with the light, which
increases or decreases the voltage applied to the light
bulb.US- 4,666,280 discloses a flash unit wherein the degree
of concentration of flash lighting is varied responsive to
detection of a backlight situation. The concentration of
the flash unit light is increased when the backlighting
increases so as to match foreground subject illumination
with the background.US- 4,959,755 discloses a video camera including a
light sensor for sensing ambient light and reflected
radiant light from a scene. The lamp intensity is lowered
when the ambient light level increases. This patent
