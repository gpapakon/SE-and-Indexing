<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method and an arrangement for tension-controlled winding of a supply line. To this end, a position transmitter (Pos) is arranged on a winding device (K) for, for example, electric cable. It picks up the movement of the cable drum depending on an applied driving torque. Via the acceleration and the mechanical rating of the cable drum and of the drive (An), an evaluating unit (Aus) can determine the tension which is exerted by the electric cable. Depending upon this tension, the cable is then, in a drive-supported manner, wound up or unwound or the winding device (K) remains in the rest state. In comparison with the state of the art, this arrangement affords the advantage that only one position transmitter (Pos) is required and no tension sensors are necessary. With the method according to the invention, a temporally adjustable torque sequence is, if appropriate, also imparted to the cable drum, which is matched to the active friction forces, in order to determine the line tension very carefully therefrom.
