<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to anticoccidial 
methods, animal feed premixes, and animal feeds, employing a 

specified o-phenylenediamine or benzimidazole. The present 
invention is also directed to anticoccidial methods, animal 

feed premixes, and animal feeds employing two active agents. 
In such combined therapy, a first substance is a polyether 

antibiotic, and the second substance is a designated o-phenylenediamine, 
benzimidazole, or benzimidazoline.

<DESCRIPTION>
Coccidiosis is a protozoan disease of fowl and other animals. 
Uncontrolled, it is a devastating disease. Chemotherapeutics are known, 
such as the polyethers monensin and narasin, sold under the trademarks 
Coban® and Monteban®, respectively. However, there are various 
problems. Some chemotherapeutics cause undesirable side effects. 
Others, especially if used recurringly in a facility, lead to the development of 
reduced sensitivity or resistance to a particular chemotherapeutic or entire 
class of chemotherapeutics. For this reason, combinations are employed, 
such as the combination of narasin and nicarbazin, sold under the 
trademark Maxiban®. Also, "rotation" and "shuttle" regimens are used, in 
which different anticoccidial regimens are employed from one growout to the 
next, and during a growout. However, even with all of these available 
techniques, there is still a continuing need to discover new 
chemotherapeutic techniques for the control of coccidiosis. It has now been discovered that certain phenylenediamines 
and benzimidazoles, more fully defined below, are efficacious against 
coccidiosis. These compounds can be employed to treat and/or prevent 
coccidiosis in fowl. They may be employed alone or, in a preferred 
embodiment, they are employed in combination with a polyether. In an 
especially preferred embodiment, the present combination therapy is used 
to prevent or treat coccidiosis attributable to a polyether-insensitive strain of 
Eimeria. The topic of drug insensitivity is well reviewed in 
Jeffers, T.K. Coccidia and intestinal coccidiomorphs, Vth International 
Coccidiosis Conference, Tours (France), 17-20 October 1989. Ed. INRA 
Publ., 1989 (Les Colloques de l'INRA, no. 49), pages 295-308. Anticoccidial 
drug resistance: a review with emphasis on the polyether ionophores.  The present invention is directed to a method of preventing or 
treating coccidiosis in a fowl which comprises administering to the fowl an 
effective amount of an active agent selected from compounds of the 
formulae
