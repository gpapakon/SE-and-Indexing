<ABSTRACT>
A printing system is described for use with linerless 
adhesive coated label stock (36). A print head (32) is disposed close 

to an endless belt (40) and the stock passed therebetween so that 
labels are printed on one side and adhered on the other side 

to the belt. Downstream of the print head the belt makes an 
abrupt change of direction which is effective to detach the 

now printed label stock therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the printing of 
merchandising labels for wrapped packages. In product merchandising, such as in the supermarket 
business for example, products are wrapped typically in 
stretch or shrink film, then conveyed to a labeler which 
automatically prints and attaches a label to the product 
package giving price. or other information about the product. 
The labels are provided in the form of a narrow continuous 
strip of paper stock and are joined at tearable perforations 
so that individual labels may be printed and separated from 
the strip for attachment to the package. Label stock of the type currently in use is supplied in 
roll form. The labels are made from thermosensitive paper 
and have an adhesive backing on them so that they will 
adhere to the plastic wrapping of the package. In order to 
keep the labels from sticking to themselves while in roll 
form or during handling, the labels are mounted on a 
continuous backing, or liner. The typical liner is a paper 
material coated on one side with silicone. The silicone 
coating allows the labels to be readily separated from the 
liner prior to attachment to a package. A disadvantage of using such conventional label stock 
having a liner is that the spent liner must be collected and 
disposed of. This typically involves providing a take-up 
reel for storing the used liner. The reel must be changed 
periodically in the operation of the labeling machine and 
the full reel must be discarded or replaced with an empty 
reel, involving down time of the label machine.  
 Label stock can be supplied in a linerless form. That 
is, the label material may be supplied in roll form but 
without a silicone-coated backing paper. The labels are 
coated on their print side with silicone so that their 
adhesive side will not stick appreciably to the print side 
when in roll form. A significant problem arises with using 
such linerless label stock in that the adhesive side of the 
labels tends to adhere to the conveying members when the 
label stock is transported through the printer. This is 
particularly a problem at the thermal print head where the 
label must be pressed against the print head to obtain an 
acceptably printed label. The typical means for pressing 
the label against the print head is neoprene roller 
juxtaposed next to the print head. Without a liner, the 
label stock will adhere to the print roller and be incapable 
of being transported to the package. FR-A-2414763 discloses an apparatus for printing 
labels which have

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for printing linerless labels having an 
adhesive coating on one side thereof, comprising a print 

head (32) for printing indicia on the print side of the 
labels (36), a print element (34) disposed in close 

proximity to the print head (32) and adapted to press the 
labels (36) against the print head (32) during printing, 

and an endless belt (40) adapted to travel around the 
print element (34), wherein the labels are conveyed by the belt and adhered to the belt at the printing head, characterised in that the print element is in the form of a print roller, and in that a peel bar (42) 

is positioned in spaced relation to the print roller (34) 
and within the endless belt (40), wherein the labels (36) 

are conveyed to the peel bar (42) where they are released 
from the belt (40). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 comprising an idler 
pulley (44) with the belt (40) travelling around the print 

roller (34), peel bar (42) and idler pulley (44). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2 comprising 
means (48) for applying a non-stick coating to the belt 

(40) as the belt (40) is travelling around the print 
roller (34) and peel bar (42). 
Apparatus for printing linerless labels having an 
adhesive coating on one side thereof, comprising a print 

head (32) for printing indicia on the print side of the 
labels (36), a print element (34) disposed in close 

proximity to the print head (32) and adapted to press the 
labels (36) against the print head (32) during printing; 

and an belt (40) adapted to travel around the 
print element (34) 

wherein the labels (36) are adhered to the belt (40) at 
the print head (32) and are released from the belt (40) as 

the belt (40) travels around the print element (34), characterised in that the print element is in the form of a print roller, and in that an idler pulley 
(44,45) is positioned within the endless belt (40).  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 characterised in 
that a peel bar (42) is positioned outside of the belt 

(40) adjacent the print roller (34) such that the peel bar 
(42) directs the labels (36) away from the belt (40). 
A method of printing indicia on a strip of 
printable material h
aving an exposed adhesive coating on 
one side thereof comprising the steps of positioning a 

roller (34) and a peel bar (42) in spaced parallel 
relation to one another, rotating an endless belt (40) 

around the roller (34) and peel bar (42) such that the 
belt (40) makes an abrupt change of direction at the peel 

bar (42), positioning a print head (32) in close proximity 
to the roller (34), passing the strip of material (36) 

between the print head (32) and roller (34) with the 
adhesive coating facing the roller (34) such that indicia 

is printed on the strip (36) and the strip (36) is adhered 
to the belt (40) and detaching the strip (36) from the 

belt (40) as the belt (40) passes around the peel bar 
(42). 
A method of printing indicia on a strip of 
printable material having an exposed adhesive coating on 

one side thereof comprising the steps of positioning a 
first roller (34) and a second, idler roller (44) in spaced 

parallel relation one to another, rotating an endless belt 
(40) around the rollers (74,44) such that the belt (40) 

makes an abrupt change of direction at the first roller 
(34), positioning a print head (36) in close proximity to 

the first roller (34), passing the strip of material (36) 
between the print head (32) and the first roller (34) with 

the adhesive coating facing the roller (34) such that 
indicia is printed on the strip (36) and the strip (36) is 

adhered to the belt (40) and detaching the strip (36) from 
the belt (40) as the belt (40) passes around the first 

roller (34).
