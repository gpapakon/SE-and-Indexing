<ABSTRACT>
Methods and reagents for the in situ detection of chromosome structure or a region of a chromosome involved in rearrangements are disclosed. These reagents include a multiplicity of labeled probe DNA sequences that are complementary to different portions of the chromosome or chromosome region to be detected, and label specific antibodies conjugated to interdependent signal producing moieties. Selected pairs of the probes are contacted under hybridizing conditions with the chromosome or chromosome region of interest. Subsequently, said label specific antibodies are attached to the labels, resulting in the coupling of said moieties chemical reactions upon the addition of substrates. Consequently, a signal is produced at the chromosome region of interest that can be detected by optical means.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR DETECTION OF CHROMOSOMAL STRUCTURE ANDREARRANGEMENTSThis invention relates to methods for detecting a site characterized by a genetically significant rearrangement event in targeted chromosomal DNA sequences which may occur at any location in any chromosome. This invention further relates to methods comprising steps of applying first and second labelled probes to a target nucleic acid at regions adjacent to said site, wherein the probes comprise DNA sequences which are complementary to the chromosomal DNA sequences of interest. One key element of this invention is that the labelled probe DNAs are then specifically associated with first and second interdependent signal producing moieties capable of interaction by the diffusion of a chemical substance to produce a detectable signal. With the addition of reagent , the first and second moieties are induced to produce a signal at the site of a genetically significant event, and the presence or absence of the signal is then optically detected.This invention also relates to methods for revealing pre-existing fluorescent labels, both for revival of faded labels and confirmation of previous results.Background Of The' InventionChromosome structure is intimately related to the manner and. mechanics of gene expression in normal cell function. Just as importantly, conservation of chromosome structure during cell division is necessary for transmission of genetic information from cell to cell, and from generation to generation. Often however, chromosome structure is changed and may forecast problems in gene function.Alterations in chromosome structure often coincide with, and may be the cause of many inborn genetic disorders and degenerative diseases, including certain cancers. Such alterations may take the form of additional or absent whole chromosomes, or additional or absent portions of chromosomes. Chromosomes may also be rearranged, as by a translocation, so that different chromosomal regions come to be linked to each other. A host of other genetic defects, including inversions, 

amplifications, and outright deletions, can occur alone or in combination with the above named defects.Some gross chromosomal alterations are detectable as diseases. Alterations such as additional or absent chromosomes may lead to, for example, Down syndrome (extra chromosome 21 matter), Turner syndrome (deleted X chromosome in females) or Klinefelter syndrome (XXY chromosomes). Alterations involving parts of chromosomes can produce, for example, chronic myeiogenous
