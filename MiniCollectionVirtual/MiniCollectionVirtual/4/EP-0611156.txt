by attaching it to an article without applying any special 

energy, and an anaerobically setting adhesive sheet prepared 
by coating or impregnating a sheet with the above anaerobic 

adhesive and well-balanced between storage stability and 
setting properties, the anaerobic adhesive comprising; 


(A) a rubber-based resin having adhesion 
properties, 
(B) a compound which has both the capability of 
absorbing oxygen and the capability of forming peroxide, and 

which shows an oxygen absorption amount of 0.1 to 3.0 % 
(weight of absorbed oxygen/weight) and an active oxygen 

amount of 0.01 to 1.0 % (weight of active oxygen/weight), 
(C) an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or 
oligomer, and 
(D) an organic peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anaerobic 
adhesive which shows adhering properties when attached to an 
adherend or article (which is to be bonded to another), 
adheres to the article temporarily and undergoes setting to 
show high adhesion strength. It also relates to a sheet or 
tape (to be simply referred to as "sheet" hereinafter) 
coated with the above anaerobic adhesive. In the field 
where a pressure-sensitive tape is used, this anaerobic 
adhesive sheet is suitably used when high reliability for 
adhesion is required but conventional pressure-sensitive 
sheets are not so satisfactory as expected. Further, in the 
field where an adhesive is used, this anaerobic adhesive 
sheet is suitably used as a substitute for an adhesive where 
the advantage of an adhesive in the form of a sheet works or 
the use of an adhesive may contaminate a working 
environment. A setting type adhesive sheet which shows adhering 
properties when attached to an article, easily adheres to 
the article temporarily and the undergoes setting to show 
high bond strength is typically classified into a humidity-setting 
adhesive sheet which undergoes setting in the 
presence of moisture in air or water in an article 
(JP-B-47-44017, JP-B-49-5895, JP-A-54-64536, JP-A-58-171460, 
JP-A-59-58071, JP-A-61-145268 and JP-A-61-148281) and an 
anaerobically setting adhesive sheet which undergoes 
setting by shielding it from air (JP-B-58-12918, JP-A-59-199784, 
JP-A-59-199785, JP-A-60-6773, JP-A-60-11568 and 
JP-A-60-13868).  However, both the adhesive sheets of the above 
types have vital problems. That is, the humidity-setting 
adhesive sheet is required to be stored in a dry state 
before use, and its production requires special facilities. 
The anaerobically setting adhesive sheet is required to 
be stored in such a state that it is always in contact with 
air, and it has a difficulty in that an attempt to improve 
the setting properties so that the adhesive undergoes in the 
presence of a small oxygen amount and an attempt to improve 
the storage stability are contradicting each other. It is 
hence very difficult to allow general pressure-sensitive 
setting adhesive sheets to exhibit balanced functions, and 
there can be obtained only setting-type adhesive sheets 
which are unsatisfactory in a balance between storage 
stability and setting properties or between adhering 
properties and adhesion properties. In an adhesion method in which a setting-type 
adhesive sheet is attached to the surface of one article, 
the article is
