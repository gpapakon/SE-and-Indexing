<ABSTRACT>
A modular counterline (2) system disclosed which uses separate sections which can be offset, one from the other, to provide flexibility for initial design requirements as well as for changing the layout as the user's needs change. The system also accommodates the convenient capability to allow wires and the like (30) to be added into a raceway or passageway (22) without threading through ports. The system also uses opposed side frames between sections for partially defining the passageway.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular 
counterline or desking system. There are a host of businesses that provide service 
to a customer who deals across the counter with a service 
representative. The most well recognized counterline type 
systems are those used in banks, ticket counters, car 
rental counters, only to mention a few. These businesses 
have recognized that an effective counter system can assist 
them in providing service to the customer as well as 
contributing to the overall image of the company. Banks, in particular, have recognized the need to 
be flexible with respect to their counterline to reflect 
changes in demographics of the area in which they serve as 
well as the times. In the past, most counterlines have 
been considered permanent, or at least did not readily 
accommodate changes in layout and configuration and, in 
most cases, were difficult to modify to the overall look 
and/or feel of the system. In many cases, the cost to 
change a system outweighed the perceived benefits and, 
therefore, the same image was maintained. There remains a need to provide a flexible 
counterline system which can accommodate changes in 
configuration and can be broken down into individual 
modules, should changes and/or changes in location be 
necessary. A unique self-standing desk with a front channel 
and side channels for receiving wires is shown in United 
States Patent 4,948,205. The channels are top opening and 
have hinged covers. The reference does not address the 
problems associated with, and unique to, counterlines nor a  
 
counterline structure which is modular with convenient wire 
management. A counterline according to the present invention 
comprises a plurality of modules which abut along the sides 
thereof and are adapted to be horizontally shiftable from 
an aligned position to a forwardly offset overlapped 
position to a rearwardly offset overlapped position. Each 
module includes cooperating front and side channel 
passageways for receiving and guiding wires and lines which 
extend in the length of the counterline from module to 
module. The front channel passageway extends across the 
module and cooperates with the side channel passageways to 
form a connecting passageway between offset front channel 
passageways of adjacent offset modules. The portion of the 
side channel passageway which connects front channel 
passageways of adjacent offset modules is accessible from 
the exterior of the module. A counterline system, according to the present 
invention, comprises
