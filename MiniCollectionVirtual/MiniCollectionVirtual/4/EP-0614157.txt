<ABSTRACT>
An information processing system comprises a neural net with fully 
distributed neuron and synapse functionalities in a spatially inhomogeneous medium to 

propagate a response field from an input to an output. The response field is a reaction 
of the medium to a plurality of input signals and depends non-linearly on the input 

signals. The response field is also determined by the inhomogeneities. The value of the 
field at one or more particular locations is indicative of one or more output signals of 

the neural net.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an information processing system with a neural
net comprising neurons interconnected by synapses. The network has an
input means to receive a plurality of input signals, an output means to provide at least
one output signal, and an arrangement between the input means and the output means to
implement a neural transformation of the plurality of input signals for generating the
output signal.Over the last decade, neural networks have gained an ever increasing
interest as signal processors, whose essential characteristics reside in the non-linear
mapping of input signals onto output signals using spatially distributed elements and
massively parallel information processing in a densely interconnected structure. Such a
processor is a robust and fault-tolerant processing device. Furthermore, neural networks
can be programmed by means of training on the basis of examples rather than by means
of prescribing algorithmic instructions such as in the field of conventional
microprocessors. Training can be accomplished with or without a supervisor, the latter
version being called "self-learning". Neural networks are expected to play an important
role, especially in the fields of associative memories, classifiers, pattern recognition and
optimization problems. For a general introduction, see: "An Introduction to Computing
with Neural Nets", R.P. Lippmann, IEEE ASSP Magazine, April 1987, pp. 4-22.Although some of the mathematical algorithms created for neural network
control or neural network simulation appear to be useful in seeking software solutions to
particular problems, the real benefit of the neural network approach is believed to be
obtainable only by way of dedicated hardware. A variety of electronic and optical
hardware implementations of neural networks have seen the light over the last decade.
For example, the Laboratoires d'Ã‰lectronique de Philips has developed the first
commercially electronic, fully digitally operating, trainable neural chip for modular 
neural network architectures, see U.S. Patent 4,994,982. An electronic implementation
of an analog neural net is known from, for instance, U.S. Patent 4,866,645. Optical
neural nets are dealt with in: "Optical Neural Computers", Y.S. Abu-Mostafa and D.
Psaltis, Scientific American 256, March 1987, pp. 66-73.Often, spatially tight designs are required to realize a sufficiently large
number of the neurons and synapses in a confined space. A trainable neural net requires
additional circuitry to individually and accurately modify the
