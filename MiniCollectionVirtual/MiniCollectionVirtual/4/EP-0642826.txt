<ABSTRACT>
The production of filter material from activated carbon compacts, use of which makes possible selective separation of organic and inorganic phase, proceeds with the following steps:   (a) mixing to homogeneity activated carbon particles having a size of 1 to 100  mu m with aluminium oxide of the pseudoboehmite modification in the ratio 1:1 to 5:1,   (b) adding distilled water, mixing well,   (c) adding dilute acetic acid, mixing well,   (d) adding distilled water again, (e) forming tablets or similar structures in a mould under pressure and   (f) sequential heating of the tablets to     1) 80 to 100 DEG C for 6 to 10 hours,   2) 140 to 160 DEG C for 8 to 10 hours   3) 180 to 200 DEG C for 6 to 10 hours.     A filter material according to the invention for selective separation of organic material from an organic phase comprises activated carbon compacts produced in this manner and is used for selective separation of organic and inorganic phases.
