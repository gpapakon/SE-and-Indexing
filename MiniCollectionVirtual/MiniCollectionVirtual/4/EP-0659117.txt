<ABSTRACT>
A method for making an absorbent article for absorbing liquids, particularly body fluids such as menses is disclosed. Discrete segments of tensioned elastic material are adhered to the backsheet. The elastic material is held in tension by a restraint material. A continuous web of wrapper material is fed to an assembly station. A panty fastening adhesive is intermittently applied to the web of wrapper material. The web of wrapper material is secured to the backsheet and the restraint material to form a sanitary napkin assembly. The web of wrapper material is cut into discrete lengths. The sanitary napking assembly is then folded and the wrapper is sealed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to individually wrapped
disposable absorbent articles, and more particularly, to such
individually wrapped disposable absorbent articles which restrain the
elastic forces while wrapped and which free the elastic forces when
unwrapped, allowing them to act on the absorbent article.All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for the
absorption of bodily fluids are, of course, well known. Current
types of absorbent articles include sanitary napkins, pantiliners,
diapers, and incontinent articles.Several prior art structures have been developed to improve the
overall fit of absorbent articles so that they more readily conform
to the contours of the human body. By improving the fit of the
absorbent article, it is expected that the performance of the
absorbent article will also improve. In some prior art sanitary
napkins elastic has been placed along the lateral edges of the
sanitary napkin. The elastic is contained within the material
comprising the absorbent article and therefore is not visible to the
consumer. The elastic provides the sanitary napkin with an upwardly
cupped shape improving the overall fit of the sanitary napkin to the
body. However, there are numerous packaging, transport and storage
problems associated with articles having an upwardly cupped shape.European patent applications EP-A-47106 and EP-A-113976, and US Patent No.
4,863,542 disclose methods for attaching elastic ribbons to absorbent articles. None of
those prior art documents discloses a method that includes a wrapper material on a
second assembly station, nor the articles made according to these methods can be
packed, transported and stored in a substantially flat configuration, since the applied
elastics provide them with a curved shape.Other prior art sanitary napkins are of a substantially planar
configuration making them easier to package, transport, and store.
However, these prior art sanitary napkins remain in their
substantially planar configuration throughout their use. While being
easier to package, transport and store, the substantially planar
sanitary napkin does not readily conform to the contours of the human
body. According, the substantially planar sanitary napkin provides 
an overall fit which is perceived as less than desirable by some
users who prefer the upwardly cupped configuration.Accordingly, it is desirable to produce an individually wrapped
absorbent article, e.g., sanitary napkin, which can be packaged,
transported, and stored in a substantially planar or flat
con

A method for continuously attaching discrete segments of a tensioned
elastic material to predetermined, isolated portions of moving

absorbent articles (20), said absorbent articles (20) having a topsheet (22), a
backsheet (23), and an absorbent core (24), said method comprising the

steps of:

(a) feeding an assembled sanitary napkin (20) to a first assembly station (200);
(b) feeding a ribbon of stretched elastic material (250) to said first assembly
station (200);
(c) adhering discrete segments of a tensioned elastic material (250)
to said backsheet (23) at said first assembly station, said tensioned

elastic material (250) being held in tension by a restraint material (252);
(d) feeding a continuous web of wrapper material (230) to a second
assembly station;
(e) applying a panty fastening adhesive intermittently to said
continuous web of wrapper material [230);
(f) securing said continuous web of wrapper material (230) to said
backsheet (23) and said restraint material (252) to form a sanitary napkin

assembly;
(g) cutting said continuous web of wrapper material (230) into
discrete lengths;
(h) folding said sanitary napkin (20) and wrapper (230) assembly; and
(i) sealing said wrapper (230).
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of
securing a ribbon of restraint material (252) to said ribbon of elastic

material (250), said restraint material (252) maintaining said ribbon of elastic
material (250) in a substantially tensioned state. 
The method of Claim 2, further comprising the step of
cutting the ribbon of tensioned elastic material (250) into discrete

segments.
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of
securing an adhesive tab (44) and a complimentary landing member (46) to the

exposed surface of said wrapper (230).
The method of any one of the preceding Claims, wherein said
tensioned elastic material (250) is adhered to said backsheet (23) of said

absorbent article (20) with an adhesive.
The method of any one of the preceding Claims, wherein said
wrapper (230) is adhered to the restraint material (252) with an adhesive.
The method of any one of the preceding Claims, wherein said
absorbent article (20) and said wrapper (230) are folded about at least two

fold-axes.
The method of any one of the preceding Claims, wherein the

portions.
A method for continuously attaching discrete segments of a
stretched elastic material to predetermined, isolated portions of

a backsheet (323), and an absorbent core (324) said method comprising the

steps of:

(a) feeding a continuous web of backsheet material (323) to an
assembly station;
(b) securing an absorbent core (324) to said continuous web of
backsheet material (323);
(c) securing intermittent portions of a continuous ribbon
of stretched elastic material (350) to said backsheet (323) at predetermined

discrete locations;
(d) cutting said ribbon of elastic (350) material at
predetermined locations; 
(e) maintaining said backsheet (323) and the stretched elastic
material (350) in a substantially tensioned state;
(f) feeding a continuous web of topsheet material (322) to said
assembly station;
(g) securing said topsheet web (322) to said backsheet web (323);
(h) cutting said continuous web of absorbent articles into
discrete absorbent articles (20);
(i) maintaining said absorbent articles (20) in a substantially
