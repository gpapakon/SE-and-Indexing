<ABSTRACT>
A process for etching aluminum from a 
substrate, where portions of the aluminum are protected 

by a resist material, is described. The substrate is 
placed into a chamber and a process gas comprising HCl, 

Cl-containing etchant and N₂ is introduced in the chamber. 
A plasma is generated in the chamber to generate from the 

process gas an etch gas that etches aluminum from the 
substrate at fast rates, with good selectivity, reduced 

profile microloading, and substantially only anisotropic 
etching.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for 
etching aluminum from a substrate. Reactive ion etching processes are used in the 
fabrication of semiconductor and other devices with 
submicron sized features, such as integrated circuit 
chips. These processes are used to etch aluminum alloys 
from a surface of a silicon wafer, where portions of the 
aluminum are protected by a pattern of an etch-resistant 
"resist" material, such as photoresist or oxide-hardmask. 
The protected aluminum portions form "features" which are 
left on the silicon wafer to form part of the integrated 
circuits being processed on the wafer. Etching is 
effected by introducing a process gas into a chamber, 
generating a plasma in the chamber to create an etch-gas 
that etches aluminum from the substrate to create a 
volatile aluminum-containing compound, such as AlCl3, and 
removing the volatile aluminum-containing compound from 
the chamber. Typically, the process gas comprises BCl3 and 
Cl2, and optionally N2. A problem with this process gas 
is that relatively thick residues or deposits containing 
Al, Cl, B and N, form on the chamber walls and on the 
resist material. The deposit on the chamber walls can 
form particles that contaminate the wafers. Further, the 
resist material can have excessive amounts of residue  
 
form on it, thereby undesirably increasing the area 
protected by the resist material. These problems can 
render the processed wafer unsuitable for use. A deposit layer can also form on the sidewalls 
of the freshly etched channels in the aluminum containing 
layer. This deposit layer serves as a "passivating" 
barrier which hinders continued etching, thereby 
preventing "isotropic" etching or undercutting. 
Isotropic etching occurs when etching proceeds 
horizontally below the resist layer, instead of 
vertically through the uncoated portions, resulting in 
the lower portions of the features being inwardly sloped. 
Although vertical "anisotropic" etching is desirable, an 
excessive passivating layer on the sidewalls is difficult 
to subsequently clean-off. With typical BCl3 based 
systems, it is difficult to control the amount of deposit 
on the sidewalls. Furthermore, typical BCl3 based systems result 
in increased profile microloading, which occurs when the 
cross-sectional profile of the features formed in the 
aluminum containing layer vary as a function of the 
spacing between the features. It is desirable to have an 
etching process which provides features with a uniform 
cross-section regardless of
