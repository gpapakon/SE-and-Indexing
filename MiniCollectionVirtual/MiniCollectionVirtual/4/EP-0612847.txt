<ABSTRACT>
Anti-microbial proteins isolated from sugar beet, wherein the anti-microbial proteins 
exclude chitinases and glucanases. Said proteins include a pure protein selected from 

those depicted in SEQ ID Nos 2, 5 and 8, or a functionally equivalent analogue thereof 
in which one or more amino acids have been added, substituted or removed without 

substantially reducing the protein's anti-microbial activity, or mixtures of such proteins 
or analogues. A synergistic anti-fungal effect is observed if at least one of the AX 

proteins is combined with a WIN protein. The invention also provides recombinant DNA 
comprising a sequence encoding a protein according to the invention, a vector comprising 

said DNA and transformed plants comprising said DNA. The invention further provides 
an anti-microbial composition containing one or more of the said proteins, and a process 

for combatting fungi or bacteria which comprises exposing them to said proteins or 
compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to anti-microbial proteins isolated from sugar beet. An anti-microbial protein includes a protein (alone or in combination with another material) 
which is toxic or growth inhibitory under any circumstances to any micro-organism, including 
bacteria, viruses and particularly fungi. Such anti-microbial proteins include those that 
exhibit anti-microbial activity upon contact with a micro-organism and those that are anti-microbial 
as a consequence of assimilation or respiration thereof. According to the present invention there is provided anti-microbial proteins isolated from 
sugar beet, wherein the anti-microbial proteins exclude chitinases and glucanases. It is preferred that the sugar beet has been infected with a fungus of the genus Cercospora, 
and more particularly preferred that the proteins have been isolated from the leaves of sugar 
beet infected with Cercospora beticola.The invention also includes a pure protein selected from those depicted in SEQ ID Nos 2, 5 
and 8, or a functionally equivalent analogue thereof in which one or more amino acids have 
been added, substituted or removed without substantially reducing the protein's anti-microbial 
activity; or mixtures of such proteins or analogues. The invention also includes a pure protein consisting of residues 80-111 in SEQ ID No. 8, 
or residues 29-74 in either SEQ ID No. 2 or SEQ ID No. 5, or a functionally equivalent 
analogue thereof in which one or more amino acids have been added, substituted or removed 
without substantially reducing the protein's anti-microbial activity; or mixtures of such 
proteins or analogues. Proteins having the amino acid sequences of residues 29-74 in SEQ 
ID Nos 2 and 5 are hereinafter referred to as AX1 and AX2 respectively, and protein having 
the amino acid sequence of residues 80-111 in SEQ ID No. 8 is hereinafter referred to as 
AX3.1 Infection of plants with fungal or viral pathogens may induce a synthesis of about 10 
families of homologous pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) in vegetative tissues. 
Such PR-proteins have been classified into 5 groups. The PR-2, PR-3 and PR-5 proteins are  
 
beta-1,3-glucanase, chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins respectively. Specific functions 
have not been assigned to the PR-1 and PR-4 groups of proteins. The PR-4 proteins are 
similar to C-terminal domains of prohevein and the putative wound-induced WIN proteins of 
potato, thus lacking the N-terminal hevein domain. "Basic counter-part of the acidic 
pathogenesis-related 4
