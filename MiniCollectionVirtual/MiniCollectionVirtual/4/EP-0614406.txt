<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to gear forming 
machines and in particular to those machines which form 
gears by the hobbing process, utilizing tools having 
helically arranged stock removing surfaces according to the 
precharacterising part of claim 1 and to a method of shifting 
a hobbing tool according to the precharacterising part 
of claim 17 respectively. In the hobbing process a rotating, generally 
cylindrical-shaped tool having helically arranged stock 
removing surfaces is brought into contact with a rotating 
workpiece, generally a gear blank. In spur gear hobbing, 
the tool and workpiece rotate in a timed relationship as 
though the workpiece were a gear rotating in mesh with a 
worm gear represented by the hobbing tool. When helical 
gears are hobbed, a supplemental rate of motion is 
applied to the workpiece rotation, either advancing or 
retarding the fundamental timing relative to hobbing tool 
rotational rate, in order to develop the appropriate 
helix angle across the face width of the gear teeth being 
machined. Hobbing is primarily used for producing spur 
and helical gears; however, other products, such as worm 
wheels, sprockets, and splined shafts may also be 
produced by the hobbing process.  
 In the process of hobbing spur and helical gear 
teeth, splines, and sprockets, a relatively short 
lengthwise region on the hob is employed in the 
generation of teeth on a given workpiece. While it would 
be possible to use very short hobs in general on hobbing 
machines (with the possible exception of those used for 
worm wheel hobbing), without ever shifting the tool 
lengthwise along its axis of rotation relative to the 
workpiece, in practice this is an uneconomical approach, 
because of the frequent tool exchange interval that would 
result. Such hobs are used only as a last resort under 
unusual conditions in which any relative shifting would 
result in mutilation of adjacent portions of the 
workpiece. The general practice is to use a relatively long 
cylindrical hob, which is shifted along its axis either 
periodically in small increments during intervals between 
cutting operations, or continuously during the cutting 
operation in order to allow all regions along its length 
to cut and thus spread the tool wear over the entire 
tool. An adjustment in the workpiece rotational rate is 
made when continuously shifting to maintain timing with 
the tool. The purpose of axially shifting the tool, in 
either case, is simply to avoid excessive wear at any 
given location on the hob,
