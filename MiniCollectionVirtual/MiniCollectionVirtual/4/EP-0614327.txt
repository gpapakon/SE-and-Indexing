An electroacoustic transducer (1) having a diaphragm (5) constructed to
be capable of vibration parallel to a transducer axis (9), which transducer has a partition

wall (24) facing the back (13) of the diaphragm, which partition wall substantially
extends transversely to the transducer axis (9) and is traversed by partition openings

(25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) to form a passage between a first space (34) situated
between the diaphragm (5) and one side (33) of the partition wall (24) and a second

space (36) situated at the other side (35) of the partition wall (36), the partition wall
openings surrounding a central passage (37) in the partition wall (24), which central

passage belongs to the first space (34), and has a mask wall (38) arranged adjacent one
of the two sides (33, 35) of the partition wall (24) and traversed by mask-wall openings

(39, 40, 41, 42) to form a passage between the two spaces (34, 36), which mask wall is
connected in a mechanically rigid manner to the partition wall (24) by means of a

circumferentially closed acoustically sealed joint (43) which, viewed from the transducer
axis (9), is situated radially beyond the partition openings (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,

32) and the mask openings (39, 40, 41, 42), at least one of the openings (29, 30, 31,
32) in one (24) of the two walls (24, 28) having a small cross-sectional area of at the

most 0.2 mm
2
 and one of the openings (39, 40, 41, 42) in the other wall (38) having a
larger cross-sectional area and being coincident with at least one of the openings (29,

30, 31, 32) of small cross-sectional area in the one wall (24) to form at least one
passage having a small acoustically active cross-sectional area between the two spaces

(34, 36) in the direction of the transducer axis (9), characterized in that each opening
(29, 30, 31, 32) of small cross-sectional area in one of the two walls (24, 38) is situated

between two spacer elements (49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56) arranged between the two
walls (24, 38) and having substantially the same distance from the central passage (37)

in the partition wall (24), and each time two spacer elements (49, 50; 51, 52; 52,53;
54, 55) together with the two walls (24, 38) bound a duct-like gap (57, 58, 59, 60)

situated between the two walls (24, 38) and leading to the central passage (37) in the
partition wall (24) to form an acoustic resistance. 
A transducer (1) as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that each spacer
element (49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56) is integral with one (24) of the two walls (24,

38).
A transducer (1) as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each
spacer element (49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56) has a height of between 20 µm and 50

µm in the direction of the transducer axis (9).
A transducer (1) as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that each
opening (29, 30, 31, 32) having a small cross-sectional area is of circular cross-section,

and the diameter of each such opening (29, 30, 31, 32) of circular cross-section is
smaller than 0.3 mm in its acoustically active cross-sectional area.
A transducer (1) as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that the diameter
of each such opening (29, 30, 31, 32) of circular cross-section is 0.2 mm in its

acoustically active cross-sectional area.
A transducer (1) as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that each
such opening (29, 30, 31, 32) of circular cross-section has a conical shape in its axial

direction.
