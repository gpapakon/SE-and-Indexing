<ABSTRACT>
The invention generally relates to a device forming a sanitary towel or the like, consisting of a central part (8) comprising an absorbent wad of elongate shape, inside a cover (1), and side flaps (2, 2') intended to be folded by the user around the lateral edges of the central part of the sanitary towel or the crotch edges of the undergarment. According to the invention, this device comprises two elements (5, 5') forming a tie, each extending over at least a part of the length of a lateral border of the said central part (8) and being fixed, at at least one point, to the side flap located on the same side, so as to retract the lateral borders when the said side flaps (2, 2') are folded.

(2, 2') intended to be turned back by the user around the

side edges of the central part of the towel or of the edges
of the crotch of the undergarment, characterized in that it

includes two rigid elements (5, 5') forming a tie, each
extending over at least part of the length of a side edge

of the said central part (8) and being attached, at least
at one point, to the side flap situated on the same side,

so as to ensure the longitudinal retraction of the side
edges when the said side flaps (2, 2') are turned back.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that each
side flap has a gusset when the central part of the said

device is flat, the said gusset disappearing when the said
side flaps are deployed and the side edges are retracted.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the two elements (5, 5') forming a tie are distinct and in

that each tie (5, 5,) is attached at its ends (6, 7, 6',
7') to a side edge of the said central part (8).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the aforementioned two elements form one and the same tie

extending over all the periphery of the said central part
(8).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the said rigid element forming a tie

is an element of the thread, string or ribbon type.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the present device has a cushion (11, 

11') on at least part of the crotch area, inside which the
two aforementioned elements forming a tie are inserted.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that side flaps are separate flaps

attached to the face of the said device intended to be in
contact with the undergarment.
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the
said envelope has openings (8, 8') situated on the said

side edges, permitting the passage of the said elements
forming a tie and in that the said elements forming a tie

are attached to the upper face of the side flaps.
