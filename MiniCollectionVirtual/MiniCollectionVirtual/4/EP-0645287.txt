<ABSTRACT>
A windscreen wiper system for vehicles with a vehicle windscreen which is (2) curved over its width has at least one driven wiper arm (5) and a wiper blade (6) which is arranged at the free end of said arm and is arranged on the wiper arm (5) in a manner such that it can pivot around a longitudinal axis (9) parallel to the wiper blade (6) in order to maintain the bearing angle on the vehicle windscreen (2). A plate (16) is mounted such that it can be rotated at the free end of the wiper arm (5) around an axis (17) parallel to the pivoting axis (8) of the wiper arm and is provided with a control cam (12) on which a sensing element (13) of the wiper blade (6) is guided during the pivoting motion of the wiper arm.

A windscreen wiper system for vehicles with a vehicle screen (2) 
which is curved over its width, comprising at least one driven wiper arm 

(5), at the free end of which is provided a wiper blade (6) which is 
variable in position relative to the wiper arm (5), and a drive derived 

from the wiper arm drive for the change in position of the wiper blade (6), 
which includes a control cam (12) and a follower element (13) which is 

guided along the control cam (12) during the pivotal movement of the wiper 
arm (5), wherein the control cam (12) is provided on a plate (16) which is 

mounted on the free end of the wiper arm (5) rotatably about an axis (17) 
parallel to the wiper arm pivot axis (8) and with which the derived drive 

is associated, characterised in that the wiper blade (6) is arranged 
pivotably about a transverse axis (21) on a mounting portion (26) and the 

mounting portion (26) is arranged pivotably about a longitudinal axis (9) 
extending parallel to the wiper blade (6) on a carrier portion (27) at the 

free end of the wiper arm (5), and that the follower element (13) is 
provided on the mounting portion (26) of the wiper blade (6). 
A windscreen wiper system according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the guide means for the plate (16) is a parallel guide means (18) 

associated with the wiper arm pivotal drive (3). 
A windscreen wiper system according to claim 2 characterised in 
that the parallel guide means (18) includes a parallelogram link (19) which 

is pivotably mounted in fixed relationship with the vehicle. 
A windscreen wiper system according to one of claims 1 and 2 
characterized in that the follower element (13) has two resilient arms 

(15). 
A windscreen wiper system according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that fitted into the carrier portion (27) and the mounting 

portion (26) is a spring leaf (14) whose bendable central region contains 
the longitudinal axis (9).
