<ABSTRACT>
Triggering device for motor vehicle safety systems for utilizing and storing dynamic vehicle data on the basis of an airbag triggering unit with sensors which are aligned (+/-) differently with respect to the direction of travel of the vehicle in order to receive acceleration signals, vehicle-dynamic movement data and/or status data being input via an electronic data collecting line of the vehicle (vehicle bus) and/or other detection means for dynamic movement data or status data in the device and the algorithm on which processing is based being influenced in its parameters as a function of these additional data.

A tripping device for motor vehicle safety systems for
the use and storage of dynamic vehicle data based on


an airbag tripping device comprising differently
aligned (Â±) acceleration sensors (101) for the

recording of acceleration signals and a microprocessor
(103) and
a device for the recording of a braking process, in
particular an anti-skid system for the recording of

braking data

characterised in that
this tripping device comprises a vehicle bus (100)
which collects and distributes additionally measured

movement- and status data, such as for example steering
angle, flashing indicators, acccelerator pedal
the basic processing algorithm is influenced in respect
of its parameters as a function of this additional data
the microprocessor (103) is equipped with or assigned
to a storage unit into which the measured data are

input
this tripping device has a diagnostic interface (110)
via which the stored data can be read-out following an

accident.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the gravity of the accident determined from the recordings

is analyzed by the microprocessor (103) and this accident
gravity is fed to an emergency system which triggers

distress call, location report and information.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
additional data are input:


the actuation of accelerator- and brake pedal (tactile)
the actuation of flashing indicators or other vehicle-direction
indicators 
the detected, in particular pressure-change, signals of
a vehicle anti-skid system
the change in steering angle of the steering wheel,
implemented by the driver of the vehicle

and any data which are dependent upon or influence the
above

and that all the data are stored in a circulating ring store
for 3 to 30 seconds and in the event of an accident/crash

are unerasable and can be called up only by means of a code.
