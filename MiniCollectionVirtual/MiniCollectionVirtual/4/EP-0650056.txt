<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the liquid effluent and the solid waste in an analysis system receiving liquid samples contained in bottles (16), it is proposed to automate all the operations carried out in the analysis boxes (10a, 10b). Furthermore, when the samples necessary for the analyses have been taken from these analysis boxes (10a, 10b), the bottles can be sent, still automatically, into a recycling apparatus (52).

<CLAIMS>
Automated analysis chain having:

at least one analysis unit (10a, 10b) able to receive sealed jugs (16)
containing a liquid to be analyzed;
a pneumatic transfer system (18, 54, 56) able to automatically transfer
the jugs into the analysis unit; and
a central control unit (80) controlling the pneumatic transfer system;

characterized in that each analysis unit comprises:

automated processing means (32, 34, 36, 38) controlled by the central
control unit (80) for opening the jugs, performing sampling operations

therein, analyzing said samples and resealing the jugs, as well as first
means (26) for redespatching the jugs to the pneumatic transfer system (54);
means (24) for the storage of the jugs controlled by the central control
unit (80) and provided with an ejection station communicating directly with

the first jug redespatch means (26); and in that the processing means
incorporate gripping means (32) able to sample and then reintroduce the

jugs at the exit from the ejection station.
Analysis chain according to claim 1, characterized in that each
analysis unit (10a, 10b) also comprises means (22) for the automatic

weighing of the jugs when they enter the analysis unit, and sorting means,
controlled by the central control unit (80), in response to signals

supplied by the weighing means and able to automatically introduce the full
jugs into the storage means (24) and eliminate the empty jugs.
Analysis chain according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that at least one non-destructive measuring apparatus (14a, 14b) is

connected by the pneumatic transfer system to the first jug redespatch
means (26) and to a station for the direct supply of the storage means (24)

equipping each analysis unit (10a, 10b).
Analysis chain according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that an apparatus (52) for recycling liquid remaining in the jugs

is connected by the pneumatic transfer system to the first jug redespatch
means (26). 
Analysis chain according to claims 3 and 4 combined, characterized in
that the pneumatic transfer system comprises jug switching means (44) able

to alternately direct the jugs from the first jug redespatch means (26)
to the recycling apparatus (52) and to the non-destructive meausuring

apparatus (14a, 14b) and able to alternately direct the jugs from the non-destructive
measuring apparatus (14a, 14b) to the direct supply station

and to the recycling apparatus (52).
Analysis chain according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that there is also at least one manual analysis unit (12a, 12b)

having means (60) for opening and closing the jugs and second means (64)
for the redespatch of the jugs to the pneumatic transfer system (54).
Analysis chain according to claims 5 and 6 combined, characterized in
that the switching means (44) are also able to direct the jugs from the

first jug redespatch means (26) to the manual analysis unit (12a, 12b).
Analysis chain according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized
in that the manual analysis unit (12a, 12b) also has jug washing and

rinsing means (62).
