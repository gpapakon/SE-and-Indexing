<DESCRIPTION>
Limbs, including legs, knees, shins, ankles, feet, toes, arms,
elbows, forearms, wrists, hands and fingers, can incur pain and
discomfort from various afflictions, such as accidents, skin eruptions and
deformities.Foot and toe deformities have been noted from childhood to
adolescence and throughout adulthood. Such deformities include
bunions, hammertoes, and mallet toes, all of which can lead to pain
and/or discomfort for the afflicted individual. Conditions which can
develop secondary to these are corns, calluses, plantar warts and
blisters. These afflictions are equally painful or discomfortable as the
prior afflictions.Corns are a painful hyperkeratosis, found principally over
prominent toe joints and between toes. There are two common types of
corns: Heloma Durum and Heloma Molle. Heloma Durum (hard corn) is
a hyperkeratotic lesion which appears over a bony prominence and may
have a deep nucleus. These corns are normally very tender and painful.
The Heloma Molle (soft corn) is a hyperkeratotic lesion which is found
between the toes. The soft corn results from pressure exerted between
adjacent toes and is soft due to moisture between the toes.A callus may be a difuse or circumscribed area of hyperkeratosis
at a site of repeated pressure and friction. In cases where there is a
forefoot imbalance the plantar callus may be found where the metatarsal
heads are most prominent.Plantar warts are simple papilomas caused by a virus. Plantar
warts differ from calluses and are not necessarily found over bony
prominences. They may be sharply circumscribed with their edges
clearly demarcated from the surrounding skin. Their center is darker
than the surrounding skin and their may have a mosine appearance. 
Warts are usually painful to squeezing and often exhibit pain from the
pressure of walking.Hammertoe is a fixed flexion deformity of the proximal
interphalangeal joint. This condition is most commonly found in the
lesser toes. Other toe deformities include mallet toe which is a flexion
deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint.A blister is a collection of fluid below or within the epidermis
caused by excessive frictional forces exerted on the epidermal layer.Hallux abducto valgus (bunion) is a condition which is
characterized by enlargement of the big toe joint and migration of the toe
towards the midline of the foot. Heredity is a strong influence in the
development of bunions. Bunion deformities are aggravated by
improper shoes and a biomechanical imbalance in the rear portion of
the foot. A soft tissue
