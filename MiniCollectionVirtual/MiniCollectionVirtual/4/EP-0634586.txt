<ABSTRACT>
Tip for friction lining wear indicator, this lining being mounted on a carrier plate (16), especially a brake pad, intended to be securely fastened to the end of an electrically conducting wire (1) and snap-fastened into a notch (15) made in the carrier plate (16). It includes a locking part (2) which, in the position of rest, can be neither engaged into nor disengaged from the notch (15) of the carrier plate (16), and which is capable of deforming elastically in order to assume an operating position allowing it to be engaged into or disengaged from the said notch (15), the said locking part (2) of the tip including a housing (4) in which the electrically conducting wire (11) can be inserted, preventing the said locking part (2) from deforming elastically in order to assume its operating position.

<CLAIMS>
A terminal fitting (1) for a brake lining wear indicator mounted on a supporting plate 
(16), in particular a brake pad, intended to be fastened to the end of an electrically conductive 

wire (11) and catch engaged in a slot (15) made in the supporting plate (16), comprising a 
locking part (2) which in the rest position can be neither engaged in, nor disengaged from, the 

slot (15) of the supporting plate (16), and which is capable of elastic deformation to assume a 
manipulating position permitting its engagement in, or disengagement from,the said slot (15), 

the said locking part (2) of the terminal fitting comprising a groove (4) into which the electrically 
conductive wire (11) can be inserted, preventing tne said locking part (2) from being elastically 

deformed to assume its manipulating position, characterized in that the groove (4) for the 
electrically conductive wire opens out at the side towards the outside via a passage allowing 

the wire to be inserted. 
A terminal fitting according to claim 1, characterized in that the axis of the groove (4) of 

the locking part is arranged in such a way that when the terminal fitting is inserted in the 
friction lining (14), the wire emerging from the lining is bent back through an angle of 

approximately 90° on the opposite side to the surface of wear of the said lining and is inserted 
in the groove (4) of the locking part. 
A terminal fitting according to any one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the 
locking part (2) of the terminal fitting has two elastically deformable wings (3) which are 

capable of being brought close to one another to assume the manipulating position, the groove 
(4) for the electrically conductive wire (11) being provided between the said wings (3) and 

having a diameter such that the presence of the electrically conductive wire (11) between the 
wings prevents the latter from coming close to one another to assume the manipulating 

position permitting their engagement in, or disengagement from the slot of the supporting plate 
(16).  

 
A terminal fitting according to claim 3, characterized in that the internal side of the 
wings (3) has a surface made suitable for keeping the electrically conductive wire (11) in 

position, for example, by each having a rib (12) parallel to the longitudinal axis of the groove 
(4). 
A terminal fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it has a 
cylindrical part (1) intended to penetrate inside an opening (18) provided in the friction lining 

(14) in the vicinity of the supporting plate (13). 
A terminal fitting according to claim 5, characterized in that the said cylindrical part (1) 
is hollow. 
A terminal fitting according to claim 5, charactenzed in that the said cylindrical part (1) 
has two grooves (8) extending along generators situated on either side of its axis, joined to the 

end of the said cylindrical part (1) ) by a groove (9) which extends along a diameter of the said 
cylindrical part (1). 
A terminal fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it has 
opposite the groove (4) a heat shield (7), intended to protect the portion of the electrically 

conductive wire (11) situated between the friction lining and the groove (4) of the locking part, 
when the terminal fitting is inserted in the friction lining. 
A terminal fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it is made 
of a material withstanding temperatures of the order of 450°C, such as, in particular, a polyimide, 

a phenolic resin, PEK or PEEK.
