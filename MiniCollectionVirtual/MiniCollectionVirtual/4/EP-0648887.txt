<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition comprising a fluoroaliphatic 
radical-containing agent and a polymer comprising 
cyclic carboxylic anhydride groups for imparting water and 
oil repellency to fibrous substrates and other materials 
treated therewith. In another aspect, this invention relates 
to a method of using such composition to treat such substrates 
and materials, and in another aspect it relates to 
the so-treated substrates and materials. The treatment of fibrous substrates with fluorochemical compositions 
to impart water and oil repellency is known; see, 
for example, Banks, Ed., Organofluorine Chemicals and Their 
Industrial Applications, Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, 
England, 1979, pp. 226-234. Such fluorochemical compositions 
include, for example, fluorochemical guanidines 
(US-A- 4,540,497), compositions of cationic and non-ionic fluorochemicals 
(US-A-4,566,981), compositions containing 
fluorochemical carboxylic acid and epoxidic cationic 
resin (US-A-4,426,466), and fluoroaliphatic 
alcohols (US-A-4,468,527). Additives have been employed to assist in the oil and water 
repellency of fluorochemical treating agents. US-A-4,215,205 discloses combinations of fluorochemical 
vinyl polymer and carbodiimide in compositions said 
to impart durable water and oil repellency to textiles. Some 
of the carbodiimides disclosed contain fluoroaliphatic 
groups. US-A-5,132,028 discloses compositions for imparting 
water and oil repellency to fabrics such as silk, said 
compositions containing a fluorochemical-type, water and oil 
repellent agent, a carbodiimide, and at least one component  
 
selected from the group consisting of plasticizer, metal 
alcoholate or ester, zirconium salt, alkylketene dimer, 
aziridine, and alkenyl succinic anhydride. US-A-3,955,027 discloses an improved process and 
composition for water and oil proofing textiles which comprises 
treating a textile with a polymeric fluorocarbon 
finishing agent and at least one reactive polymer extender 
having acid or anhydride functionality and curing the 
treated textile at from 80°C to 170°C for 0.1 to 60 min. The 
reactive polymer extenders are low molecular weight polymers 
having a molecular weight of less than about 8000. US-A-4,070,152 discloses compositions comprising 
a textile treating resin which is a fluorine-containing 
polymer and a novel copolymer of a maleic-anhydride 
copolymer and a fatty acid amine and an amino organo 
polysiloxane. Said compositions are useful for increasing 
the water and oil repellency of
