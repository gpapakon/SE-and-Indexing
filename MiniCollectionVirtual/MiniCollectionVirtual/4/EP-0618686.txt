<ABSTRACT>
The burst reception method involves supplying a low-pass filter with a received signal having a transmission bandwidth corresp. to that of the direct sequence spread spectrum signals. The filtered signal is sampled at a corresp. rate with a reception vector obtd. for each resulting reception signal burst, by summating a channel response vector and a noise vector. A correlation vector is provided for each possible transmission vector and a decision variable is provided for each possible transmission vector data, using an auto-correlation matrix. The transmission data vector is selected for which the decision variable is maximised.
