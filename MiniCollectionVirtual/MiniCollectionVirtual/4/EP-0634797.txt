<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin film semiconductor
device comprising a thin film transistor formed on an
insulation substrate and having a polycrystalline semiconductor
layer to define an active region. More specifically, the
present invention relates to the technique of hydrogenation
treatment of thin film semiconductors.Referring to Fig. 17, a process for hydrogenation
treatment is described briefly below. As shown in the figure,
a thin film of polycrystalline silicon 102 patterned to a
predetermined shape is formed on the surface of an insulation
substrate 101 to provide an element region. A source region S
and a drain region D containing impurities at high concentration
are formed in the thin film of polycrystalline silicon
102, and a channel region Ch is incorporated therebetween. A
thin film transistor (TFT) is established by forming a gate
electrode G on the upper side of the channel region Ch, with a
gate oxide film 103 and a gate nitride film 104 interposed
therebetween. The resulting TFT is coated with a first interlayer
dielectric 105, and an interconnecting electrode 106 is
connected to the source region S via a first contact hole
provided in the first interlayer dielectric film. A second
interlayer dielectric 107 is further deposited on the first
insulation film 105. A pixel electrode 108 made of a light-transmitting 
electrically conductive film such as an ITO
(indium tin oxide) film is formed on the second interlayer
dielectric 107 by patterning, and is electrically connected
with the drain region D of the TFT via a second contact hole.
A P-SiN film 109 is formed as an overpassivation film on the
surface of the second interlayer dielectric film 107 by
patterning. The P-SiN film 109 is a relatively porous film, and
contains hydrogen atoms at a considerable quantity. Accordingly,
the P-SiN film serves as a hydrogen supply source. Thus, by
depositing a P-SiN film 109 after forming a TFT and annealing
it thereafter, the hydrogen atoms are allowed to diffuse into
the thin film of polycrystalline silicon 102 through the second
interlayer dielectric film 107, the first interlayer dielectric
film 105, the gate oxide film 103, and the like. The hydrogen
atoms introduced by the hydrogenation treatment diffuse into
the grain boundaries of the thin film of polycrystalline
silicon 102 to finally combine with the dangling bonds.
Accordingly, the barrier potential is lowered due to the
decrease in the density of traps. The carrier mobility inside
the polycrystalline silicon TFT is thereby
