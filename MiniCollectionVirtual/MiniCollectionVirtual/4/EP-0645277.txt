<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides automatic and reliable 
determination of the touch point of a clutch controlled by 

an automatic clutch actuation controller. This invention 
determines the touch point while idling the engine, with 

the transmission in neutral and an inertial brake applied. 
The clutch actuation controller engages the clutch so that 

the measured transmission input speed matches a reference 
speed signal preferably between 40% and 60% of the idle 

speed. This reliably provides the degree of clutch 
engagement at a small torque matching the braking torque. 

The touch point is set as the 
difference between this degree of clutch engagement for the 

small torque and a clutch touch point offset. 
The determination may begin with the clutch fully engaged and 
gradually released according to control by the input and 

reference speeds. When the previous touch point is known, the 
clutch is preferably initially positioned just above the known 

touch point and then gradually released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention is that of 
automatic clutch controls, and more particularly the 
determination of the clutch position for initial torque 
transmission in an automatic clutch controller. In recent years there has been a growing interest 
in increased automation in the control of the drive train 
of motor vehicles, and most especially in control of the 
drive train of large trucks. The use of automatic 
transmissions in passenger automobiles and light trucks is 
well known. The typical automatic transmission in such a 
vehicle employs a fluid torque converter and hydraulically 
actuated gears for selecting the final drive ratio between 
the engine shaft and the drive wheels. This gear selection 
is based upon engine speed, vehicle speed and the like. It 
is well known that such automatic transmissions reduce the 
effectiveness of the transmission of power from the engine 
to the drive shaft, with the consummate reduction in fuel 
economy and power as compared with the skilled operation of 
a manual transmission. Such hydraulic automatic 
transmissions have not achieved wide spread use in large 
motor trucks because of the reduction in efficiency of the 
operation of the vehicle.  
 One of the reasons for the loss of efficiency 
when employing a hydraulic automatic transmission is loss 
occurring in the fluid torque converter. A typical fluid 
torque converter exhibits slippage and consequent loss of 
torque and power in all modes. It is known in the art to 
provide lockup torque converters that provide a direct link 
between the input shaft and the output shaft of the 
transmission above certain engine speeds. This technique 
provides adequate torque transfer efficiency when engaged, 
however, this technique provides no gain in efficiency at 
lower speeds. It has been proposed to eliminate the 
inefficiencies inherent in a hydraulic torque converter by 
substitution of an automatically actuated friction clutch. 
This substitution introduces another problem not exhibited 
in the use of the hydraulic torque converters. Friction 
clutches used exhibit considerable motion prior to initial 
clutch engagement. This point of initial clutch engagement 
is called the touch point. No torque can be transferred 
through the clutch for clutch engagement before the touch 
point. The clutch controller preferably uses the touch 
point as the zero position for its control algorithm. 
Since no controlled torque transfer can take place prior to 
the touch point, the clutch controller preferably
