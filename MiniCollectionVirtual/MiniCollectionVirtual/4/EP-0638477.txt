<ABSTRACT>
A bundling strap dispenser includes a housing. A 
trigger (30) is pivotally received in the housing and is manually 

operable from outside. A cutting means (50) with a cutting blade (51) 
is pivotally received in the housing and actuatable by the trigger. 

A retaining member (70,72,73) is mounted on the cutting means (50) 
to pivot therewith for retaining a bundling strap (101) 

when the bundling strap is being cut. A rib (21) 
extends horizontally in the upper section of the housing and 

defines an opening (22) through which the retaining element (73) is 
insertable. A stepped plate (80) is mounted above the rib to 

define a passage therebetween for the bundling strap. The 
stepped plate further includes a trough (83) for receiving a 

buckle (100) therein for engaging with the bundling strap. The 
trough defines a slot (82) in alignment with the opening (61) of the 

buckle reloader (60), and defines in a bottom side thereof a 
second slot (84) through which the blade (51) is insertable to cut the 

bundling strap after the bundling strap is retained. A 
feeding device (92,93) is mounted above the rib for feeding a new 

buckle after a previous buckle is used and removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dispenser for bundling
strap.Straps are usually utilized to bundle articles, in
which two ends of a strap are generally securely held in a
buckle. Currently available straps are in a certain length
and this often results in a waste of the straps when they
are used to bundle small articles. In addition, as the
buckle is integral with the strap, there is also a waste of
the former as the former is also abandoned when the latter
is destroyed for accessing the bundled articles.This invention provides a bundling strap dispenser to
mitigate and/or obviate the above-mentioned problems.This invention provides a bundling strap dispenser
comprising a housing, a trigger which is pivotally mounted
in the housing and is manually operable from outside, a
linking plate which is substantially U-shaped in a cross-sectional
view and can be pivoted and actuated by the
trigger and a cutting means including a first end, a second
end and a blade. The blade is attached to the first end of
the cutting means. The second end of the cutting means is
pivotally mounted above the linking plate. Thus, the
cutting means can be actuated by the linking plate by
depressing the trigger.The dispenser further has a buckle reloader securely
attached to the cutting means. The buckle reloader defines
an opening through which a bundling strap passes, and
includes a pair of reloading lugs. A resilient member, 
which is linked to the second end of the cutting means to
pivot therewith, includes a retaining element with a toothed
end for retaining the bundling strap when cutting the
bundling strap and a returning member for returning the
resilient member, the blade, and the linking plate back to
their original positions before re-triggering. A rib
extends horizontally in the upper section of the housing,
and defines a second opening through which the toothed end
of the retaining element can be passed. A stepped plate is
mounted above the rib, and defines a passage therebetween
for the bundling strap. The stepped plate further includes
a buckle-receiving trough with a slot to communicate the
passage with the opening of the buckle reloader and a second
slot in a bottom side thereof through which the blade is
insertable to cut the bundling strap after an article is
firmly bundled.A rod is mounted above the rib and carries a plurality
of buckles along a longitudinal axis thereof. The rod is
attached to a block with a third opening in alignment with
the passage for the bundling strap. A spring is mounted
around the rod and an

A bundling strap dispenser comprising:

a housing (10, 20);
a trigger (30) which is pivotally received in the housing
and is manually operable from outside;
a cutting means (50) which includes a blade (51) and is pivoted
in the housing and is actuatable by the trigger;
a retaining member (70) which is mounted to the cutting
means to pivot therewith for retaining a bundling strap (101) when

cutting the bundling strap;
a rib (21) extending in the upper section of the housing and
defining an opening through which the retaining member is

insertable;
a stepped plate (80) which is mounted above the rib (21) and
defines a passage therebetween for the bundling strap (101), the

stepped plate further including a trough (83) in which a buckle (100)
for engaging with the bundling strap is received, the trough

defining a slot (82) in alignment with the passage, the trough (83)
further defining in a bottom side thereof a second slot (84)

through which the blade (51) is insertable to cut the bundling
strap after the bundling strap is retained; and
a feeding means (90) which is mounted above the rib (21) for
feeding a new buckle (100) after the buckle in the trough is used

and removed.
The bundling strap dispenser as claimed in claim 1
further comprising a means (33) for returning the trigger (30) when

the trigger is released.
The bundling strap dispenser as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the buckling member (100) has upper and lower single

direction toothed structures (103, 104) and the bundling strap (101) defines
a plurality of recesses in one side thereof to receive the

single direction toothed structures.
The bundling strap dispenser as claimed in claim 1
wherein the feeding means includes:


a rod (91) being adapted to carry a plurality of buckles (100)
along a longitudinal axis thereof, the rod being attached to

a block with a third opening in alignment with the passage
for the bundling strap, a spring (93) being mounted around the

rod and an urging block (92) being attached to an end of the
spring for feeding the buckles; and
a buckle reloader (60) which is securely attached to the
first end of the blade, and defines an opening through which

the bundling strap (101) passes, and includes a reloading element
for carrying the new buckle into the trough (83) of the stepped

plate (80).
The bundling strap dispenser as claimed in claim 1
wherein the retaining member (70) has a toothed end (73) which passes

through the opening (22) in the rib (21) upon actuation of the trigger
to retain the bundling strap when cutting the bundling

strap.
The bundling strap dispenser as claimed in claim 1
wherein a linking plate (40) is pivoted to the housing and is

actuatable by the trigger (30), and the cutting means (50) is
