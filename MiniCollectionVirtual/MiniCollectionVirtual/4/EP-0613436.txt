<ABSTRACT>
A marine anchor (1) comprising a fluke (8) and a shank (3) attached to the fluke (8) is intended for drag embedment in a mooring bed (63) by pulling the anchor (1) substantially horizontally via the shank (3). Further, it is a particular feature of the anchor that two modes of operation are possible by means of the line (5, 6) extending between the anchor cable attachement point (4A, 4B) on the shank and the fluke centroid (7) being variable to provide a first line (5) present for drag embedment of the anchor (1), and a second line (6) utilised when the anchor is embedded, wherein the pulling force on the anchor via the shank (3) can now be essentially upwards thereby providing an increased holding force due to the increased fluke area presented in the direction of the upwards force. The change in direction from the first line (5) to the second line (6) can be achieved by having the shank (3) pivotal (Fig. 9) and by providing pivot control means (26, 29) permitting selective pivoting of the shank (3). Alternatively two separate cable attachment points (4A, 4B) can be present in the shank (3) with, as a first example (Fig. 1), two separate cables attached to said points (4A, 4B) whereby the two modes of anchor operation are achieved by transferring operation from a first cable to the second, or as a second example (Fig. 6) moving the single anchor cable (64) via a guide (11) from the first attachment point (4A) to the second (4B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to drag embedment 
marine anchors. A requirement of a drag embedment marine anchor 
comprising a fluke attached to a shank is an ability to 
dig deeply into a mooring bed. The holding capacity is 
directly related to depth of embedment below the surface 
of the mooring bed. The ability to dig into the mooring 
bed soil depends on the anchor having a fluke angle 
appropriate for the particular soil present in the mooring 
bed. The fluke angle is usually defined as the angle 
between the forward direction of the fluke and a line 
connecting the anchor cable attachment point on the shank 
to a point on the rear edge of the fluke measured in a 
fore-and-aft plane of symmetry of the anchor. In 
practice, this angle is about 50° for muds and about 30° 
for sands. The angle that a straight line containing the 
cable attachment point and the centroid of the fluke forms 
with the forward direction of the fluke is correspondingly 
in the range 60° to 70° for muds and 35° to 45° for sands 
where the fluke is of triangular or rectangular shapes 
with a length to breadth ratio in the usual range between 
1 and 2. This latter angle may be regarded as the 
centroid fluke angle. The angle of friction, , between a marine soil and a 
smooth steel anchor fluke is usually in the range 22° to 
30° for sand and 6° to 14° for mud. Thus, the centroid 
fluke angle is always made less than (90-) degrees to 
ensure that a pulling force applied at the anchor cable 
attachment point causes the anchor to penetrate by sliding 
in the soil in the forward direction of the fluke and so 
bury increasingly below the surface of the mooring bed 
when pulled horizontally thereon. A deeply buried marine drag embedment anchor is 
usually recovered by heaving vertically upwards on the 
anchor cable attached to the forward end of the anchor  
 
shank or by heaving vertically upwards on a pendant cable 
attached to a receiving hole on the anchor at or towards the rear 
edge of the fluke as shown in GB-A-1296139. In particular, GB-A-1296139 
discloses an anchor having a generally triangular form 
fluke with a straight shank joined to the fluke at a connection 
containing the fluke centroid. The shank projects beyond the toe 
of the fluke and has a first cable attachment point at the 
forward end of the shank for anchor drag embedment and a second 
cable attachment point towards the rear end of the shank 
facilitating anchor retrieval, the two attachment points lying 
respectively in first and second directions from

attaching first and second anchor cables to the anchor so as to 
lie in the first and second direction (5, 6) respectivley from 

the fluke centroid (7) whereby, in relation to the forward 
direction (F) of the fluke (8) as determined by a forward movement 

on the straight centre line (2C) of the fluke towards the front end 
of the fluke and  

 
measured in a fore-and-aft plane 

of symmetry (M-M) of the anchor, said first direction (5) forms a 
first forward opening angle (α) with said forward direction (F)

angle (β) with said forward direction (F) greater than said first 

forward-opening angle (α) so that the projected area of the fluke 
(8) in said second direction (6) is greater that the projected 

area of the fluke (8) in said first direction (5) whereby when 
the anchor is in use, a first pulling action on the anchor via 

said first anchor cable at an attachment point (4A) located in 
said first direction (5) permits drag embedment of the anchor by 

movement substantially in said forward direction (F) in the soil 
whilst a subsequent pulling action on the embedded anchor in said 

soil via said second anchor cable at an attachment point (4B) in 
said second direction (6) precludes such movement characterised 

in that at least a portion of said shank means (3) to which said 
first anchor cable is attached in use is releasable from the 

anchor, and in that remotely operable release means (46, 48) are 
provided for release of said shank portion following drag

second forward opening angle (β) with said forward direction (F) 
greater than said first forward opening angle (α), so that the

action on the anchor via said anchor cable (64) at an attachment 

point (4A) located in said first direction (5) permits drag 
embedment of the anchor by movement substantially in said forward 

direction (F) in the soil whilst a subsequent pulling action on

forms a second forward opening angle (β) with said forward 

direction (F) greater than said first forward opening angle (α)

anchor shank (3) or to a rearward portion of the anchor cable 

(64) attached to said shank to enable rotation of the anchor to 
reduce the angle of inclination of the fluke to the horizontal;

horizontally on the anchor cable (64) to cause embedment of the 

anchor (10) into the mooring bed; 
(c) measuring the load developed in the anchor cable (64) as 
embedment progresses;
