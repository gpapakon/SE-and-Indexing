<ABSTRACT>
A high speed data communication controller comprising two independent central processing units (50 and 54), each has its own program instruction fetch data path, and instruction execution data path. The data communication controller includes a dual-port serial communication subsystem (32) and a bus interface unit (40) operably associated with a four channel DMA controller (43). One central processing unit (29) is assigned the task of handling the medium access control (MAC) layer function of a multilayered local area network protocol, while the other central processing unit handles host commands (27) and buffer memory management functions associated with the transmission and reception of packets relating to the higher layer protocol. As a result of the present invention, efficient data communication processing is achieved within a single VLSI chip, thereby improving node and network data throughout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data
communication controller and an apparatus for use in
a local area network, and to a process conducted
between a host processor and a data communication
controller used at a node in a local area network.Local-area networks (LAN) are communication
systems for enabling data-processing devices, such
as computer workstations, to communicate with each
other through a communication (e.g. transmission)
media. Data-processing devices in such networks are
typically referred to as nodes or stations, many
such stations are likely to be relatively
autonomous, requiring communication with other
stations only occasionally. Other stations may
require more frequent communication, and the amount
of 
communication required by a particular station can vary
from time to time.In many local-area networks, stations can be easily
added to, removed from, and moved from place to place
within the network. While there are numerous local area
networks presently known, they can be classified into two
general types. The first type of network is referred to
as a "centralized network" which is characterized by the
requirement of a centralized network controller which
implements the network protocol. The second type of local
area network is referred to as a "distributed network"
which does not require a centralized network controller,
and instead provides each station within the network with
a communication controller having a medium access control
(MAC) unit that locally implements the network protocol
within each communication controller.In a distributed local area network, packet switching
is a technique commonly employed to dynamically allocate
the communication resources of the network among multiple
communicating stations. According to this technique,
messages to be communicated between stations are
partitioned (by the transmitting station's processor) into
packets, having a fixed maximum size. The packets are
then ascribed a station (i.e. source) identifier. The
packets are then placed on the communication medium by the
station's communication controller. Such packets are then
sensed and selectively processed by the communication
controller of the destination station in the network.Any packet from one station to another station
contains various fields of information specified in
accordance with a predetermined network protocol. The
information typically includes the identity of the source
station, the identity of the destination station, and
various other information concerning the

system bus interface means, and from said system bus interface means to said
external buffer memory (21) for storage therein, the second processing means

(27,28,56,57,58) being arranged also to manage the transfer of transmit packets
from said external buffer memory (21) to said system bus interface means and from

said system bus interface means to said data communication means (31) for
transfer to said communication medium (24).
The process of claim 38, wherein said data communication controller (15)
further comprises an internal buffer memory (32) for storage of data including

address pointers, said process further comprising the steps: 

(a) said host processor (19) writing in said shared buffer memory (21), a
first address pointer defining the beginning of a system control block in said shared

buffer memory (21), and a second address pointer defining the beginning of a host
interrupt status block in said shared buffer memory (21);
(b) said data communication controller (15) reading said first and second
address pointers from said shared buffer memory (21) and storing said first and

second address pointers in said internal buffer memory (32);
(c) said host processor (19) preparing in said shared buffer memory (21),
a transmit packet queue comprising a first transmit packet control block containing

a first buffer descriptor block pointer defining the beginning of a first buffer
descriptor block in said shared buffer memory (21) and a second transmit packet

control block in said shared buffer memory (21), said first buffer descriptor block
containing:


(i) a first data buffer pointer defining the beginning of a first data
buffer for storage of transmit packet data in said shared buffer memory (21), and
(ii) a second buffer descriptor block pointer defining the beginning
of a second buffer descriptor block in said shared buffer memory (21), said second

buffer descriptor block containing a second data buffer pointer defining the
beginning of a second data buffer for storage of transmit packet data in said shared

buffer memory (21);
(d) said data communication controller (15) reading said first data buffer
pointer from said shared buffer memory (21) and using said first data buffer pointer

to access transmit data in said first data buffer; and
(e) said data communication controller (15) writing an interrupt status
word in said host interrupt status block when the end of said transmit packet queue

has been reached.
The process of claim 39, which further comprises after step (e), 

(f) said host processor (19) reading said interrupt status word from said
host interrupt status block;
(g) said host processor (19) extending said transmit packet queue by
preparing said second transmit packet control block in said shared buffer memory

(21); and
(h) said host processor (19) writing a resume control word in said system
control block.
The process of claim 38, wherein said data communication controller (15)
further comprises an internal buffer memory (32) for storage of data including

address pointers, said process comprising the steps:

(a) said host processor (19) writing in said shared buffer memory, a first
address pointer defining the beginning of a system control block in said shared

buffer memory (21), and a second address pointer defining the beginning of a host
interrupt status block in said shared buffer memory (21);
(b) said data communication controller (15) reading said first and second
address pointers from said shared buffer memory (21) and storing said first and

second address pointers in said internal buffer memory (32);
(c) said host processor (19) preparing in said shared buffer memory (21),
a receive packet queue comprising a first receive packet control block containing a

first buffer descriptor block pointer defining the beginning of a first buffer
descriptor block in said shared buffer memory (21) and a second receive packet

control block in said shared buffer memory (21), said first buffer descriptor block
containing:


(i) a first data buffer pointer defining the beginning of a first data
buffer for storage of receive packet data in said shared buffer memory (21), and
(ii) a second buffer descriptor block pointer defining the beginning
of a second buffer descriptor block in said shared buffer memory (21), said second

buffer descriptor block containing a second data buffer pointer defining the 
beginning of a second data buffer for storage of receive packet data in said shared

buffer memory (21);
(d) said data communication controller (15) reading said first data buffer
pointer from said shared buffer memory (21) and using said first data buffer pointer

to store receive data in said first data buffer; and
(e) said data communication controller (15) writing an interrupt status
word in said host interrupt status block when the all received data has been stored

in said shared buffer memory.
The process of claim 41, which further comprises after step (e),

(f) said host processor (19) reading said interrupt status word from said
host interrupt status block; and
(g) said host processor (19) reading said receive data from said first data
buffer.
