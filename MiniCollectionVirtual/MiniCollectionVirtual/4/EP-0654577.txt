<ABSTRACT>
A window covering is described wherein at least 

one translucent or transparent sheet (60) is suspended vertically 
and has a plurality of parallel vanes (56) projecting rearwardly 

therefrom. The vanes are formed from fabric material which 
has either been rigidified with a rigidifying compound or 

rigidified by the formation of a pocket into which a rigid 
slat is inserted. Variations are provided for varying the 

flexibility of a hinge defined along a juncture line between 
the vanes and the fabric sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
window shade according to the preamble of claim 1.US-A-4450027 discloses cellular
window coverings which may be made of fabric or
film materials. A flexible strip of material
is folded into a continuous longitudinal tube
and the longitudinal folds thus created are
permanently set by passing the tube around a
heat setting wheel. Adhesive is applied along
one side of the flattened tubular material
which is subsequently stacked by winding onto a
rack having flat surfaces. The winding in this
manner presses the adhesive to the next layer
wound onto the rack to form a bonded unitary
stack of closed tubular cells. When the ends
are cut from the rack, the stack may be
expanded and the permanently set creases
provide a neat and uniform outward appearance. US-A-4732630 discloses a modification
in which hot melted adhesive is applied to one
side of the tubular material. After the flat
tubular strips have been stacked and cut, they
are placed in an oven under pressure and the
hot melted adhesive is activated to bond the
layers together.Both of the above window coverings
have a softer appearance than conventional
venetian blinds and good insulating properties.
However, they do not have the ability to
control the amount of light admitted through
the window covering, similar to a traditional
venetian blind.US-A-3384519 attempts to overcome
this and discloses two cloth layers spaced
apart by moveable parallel and flexible fabric
vanes having each of their marginal edges heat
welded to one of the moveable cloth layers.
With this window covering, relative movement of
the two cloth layers in a direction
perpendicular to the vanes changes the angle of
the vanes and thus controls the amount of light
admitted through the article. Heat welding
necessarily requires a melting of at least some
of the fibres of the materials bonded, thus
providing an uneven outer appearance along the
heat welds and producing unwanted crimps or 
creases in the materials which can result in
failure of the fabric fibres. Further, heat
welding is a relatively slow process which may
require six or more seconds to create a bond
over an extended length, which is unacceptable
for commercial production. Furthermore, the
heat welds are limited in strength and it is
difficult to achieve uniformly straight heat-welded
joints over an extended length.US-A-2865446 discloses a window
covering in which a long rectangular piece of
fabric is doubled back upon itself and a
plurality of accordion-pleated fabric elements
are placed

<CLAIMS>
A shade comprising at least one sheet like element
(60,94,118) having an inner face and outer face; a plurality

of elongate substantially planar vanes (56,98,106,112,117)
having opposite longitudinal front and rear edges (72,74),

said vanes each being hingedly connected at their front edge
(72) to the inner face of said at least one sheet like

element in spaced parallel relationship, thereby defining a
hinge (108,113,116) and operating means (64,70) operable to

rotate said vanes about longitudinal axes of the vanes,
between a closed position in which said vanes extend

substantially parallel to said at least one sheet like
element and an open position in which the vanes extend

substantially perpendicular to said at least one sheet like
element, said vanes being formed as integral extensions of

said at least one sheet like element, and said vanes having
associated therewith a stiffening means, whereby said vanes

retain a predetermined form, characterised in that said at
least one sheet like element (60,94,118) comprises a

plurality of bonded strips (96), one marginal edge (102) of
each said strips is bonded to an adjacent one of said strips

at an intermediate location thereof adjacent to the hinge
(108,113,116) of a respective one of said vanes

(56,98,106,112,117) with an opposite marginal edge (104)
of each of said strips terminating at one of said front and

rear edges (72,74) of said vanes.
A shade according to claim 1, characterised in
that a portion of each of said strips (96) forming each of

said vanes is folded back on itself to form said at least
two layers of material.
A shade according to claim 3, characterised in
that the opposite marginal edge (104) of each of said strips 

(96) is attached to itself at the front edge (72) of the
vane formed therefrom and in that adjacent marginal edges

(102,104) of adjacent strips are spaced from one another to
define a single layer of material at the hinge

(108,113,116).
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that said vanes (56,98,106,112,117) are of

fabric material.
A shade according to claim 4, characterised in
that said stiffening means include a stiffening compound

impregnated into the fabric material of said vanes.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that said vanes are compressed along said

hinge (108,113,116) to form an area that is more flexible
than the remainder of said vanes.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that said vanes are apertured (111,115)

adjacent to and between said marginal edges (102,104) to
form an area that is more flexible than the remainder of

said vanes.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that said at least one sheet like element

(60,94,118) is translucent and each of said vanes
(56,98,106,112,117) is opaque.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that said vanes extend vertically.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that said vanes extend horizontally. 
A shade according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that a further sheet like element is

flexibly attached to the rear edges (74) of said vanes
opposite of said at least one sheet like element.
