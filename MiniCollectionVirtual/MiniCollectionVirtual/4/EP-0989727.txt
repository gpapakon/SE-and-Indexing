<ABSTRACT>
A method of determining the location of an optical
feature (52) in an image projection system (1), the method

comprising:

1) projecting a first image (52') of the feature
(52) onto a detector (8) with a lens (9) in a first

position (54) ;
2) sensing, with the detector (8), the position of
the first image (52') of the feature (52);
3) projecting a second image (52'') of the feature
(52) onto a detector (8) with a lens (9) in a second

position (55) laterally spaced from the first position
(54);
4) sensing, with the detector (8), the position of
the second image (52'') of the feature (52) ; and
5) deducing the location of the defect (52) from the
difference between the positions sensed in steps 2) and 4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the location of a feature in an image projection system.An image projection system such as an input scanner or camera will conventionally have a number of different optical components (eg lenses, light sources, mirrors etc.) which project images onto a detector. Any feature (e.g. a defect) carried by one of these optical components will be imaged onto the detector. In many cases it may be desirable to determine the location of the feature but previously this has not been possible.In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of determining the location of a feature in an image projection system, the method comprising:
1) projecting a first image of the feature onto a detector with a lens in a first position;2) sensing, with the detector, the position of the first image of the feature;3) projecting a second image of the feature onto a detector with a lens in a second position laterally spaced from the first position;4) sensing, with the detector, the position of the second image of the feature; and5) deducing the location of the feature from the difference between the positions sensed in steps 2) and 4).The invention effectively measures the parallax of the feature, thus enabling the distance between the feature and the detector to be deduced.The method can be used to locate any feature but typically the feature comprises an optical component defect - e.g. a scratch or deposit on a lens, mirror, platen or light source.The positions of the first and second images may be measured in steps 2) and 4) using a single detector element which is scanned over a projection region of the lens. However preferably the or each detector comprises an array of detector elements, and the positions are sensed in steps 2) and 4) in accordance with the position of the image of the feature on the array.A pair of laterally spaced fixed lenses may be used, each projecting an image of the feature from one of the two positions. However typically the images of the feature are projected in steps 1) and 3) using the same lens, and the method further comprises moving the lens between the first and second positions.Similarly a pair of laterally spaced detectors may be used, each sensing the position of one of the two images. However typically the images of the feature are projected onto the same detector in steps 1) and 3). In this case, a single fixed array of detector elements may be used with each image being projected
