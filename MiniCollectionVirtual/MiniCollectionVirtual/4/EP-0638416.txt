<ABSTRACT>
Shot peening with a mixture of at least two sizes of shot can be used 
to obtain a textured finish press plate with desirable gloss features. The press plate 

is impacted with a mixture of shot having at least two different sizes to 
simultaneously obtain a texture and gloss control. A separate overblasting step to 

obtain a desired gloss uniformity is thereby avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for manufacturing
decorative laminates having a texturized surface formed by shot peening the surface of
the press plate.Press plates are used in a well known process to prepare decorative
laminates. These laminates are used for surfaces such as walls, table tops, furniture,
doors, kitchen cabinets, countertops, flooring tiles, and the like. The decorative
laminates are formed by compressing and bonding together thermosetting resin
impregnated pigmented or printed decorative cellulosic surface papers to a variety
of core materials, such as particle board or phenolic resin impregnated kraft paper
filler sheets and the like between press plates, with the press plate imparting a
surface finish to at least one side of the pressed laminate. The material layers are
first placed adjacent to a stainless steel press plate. The laminate components and
press plate assembly are then pressed at high pressures and elevated temperatures
to fuse the laminate materials together. After final cure, a consolidated laminate
sheet or board is formed. Once cooled, the laminates are separated from the press
plates, which are returned to the press for use in the manufacture of subsequent
laminates. The resulting laminate surface finish is an exact mirror image replication
of the press plate surface finish against which it is pressed. Press plates are thus
an important feature in the production of consistently acceptable commercial
laminate surfaces, as the laminate surfaces faithfully adopt the surface finish of the
press plate.There are two general categories of press plates, polished and textured.
The scope of the present invention is directed to textured press plates used to
manufacture matte or suede laminate finishes.A variety of methods result in a
desired textured press plate finish. A common method is chemical etching. While
this is an effective method for producing the desired textures and overall finish, it
is both costly and difficult to implement. Another method of texturizing includes
shot peening, such as that disclosed in US-A-4,076,566, or in GB-A-2 106 430.Shot peening techniques are primarily used for their mechanical benefits,
as the cumulative effect of individual particle impacts on the workpiece surface cold
works the article. As the shot particles are propelled or blasted at high velocities
onto the metal surface, the resulting plastic flow of the metal somewhat relieves
residual tensile stresses near the surface of the article by inducing compressive
stresses. The

having a texturized surface,

comprising the steps of

shot peening the surface of a press plate at least one time with a mixture
of shot particles including a first quantity of shot comprizing shot grades for

imparting a texture to the surface of the press plate and a second quantity of

250 µm or larger in diameter, and the second quantity of shot is up to
40 percent of the total shot, the diametrical sizes of the particles thereof being

essentially between 5 and 250 µm in diameter.
The method of claim 1 or 2, in which the first quantity of shot comprises a
mixture of shot having a large grade of shot particles essentially between 600

and 850 µm in diameter, the medium grade of shot particles being essentially
between 425 and 600 µm in diameter.
The method of claim 1 or 2, in which the first quantity of shot comprises a
mixture of shot having a large grade of shot particles essentially 850 µm or

larger in diameter, the medium grade of shot particles being essentially between
600 and 850 µm in diameter. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, in which the first quantity of shot comprises a
mixture of shot having a large gra
de of shot particles essentially 850 µm or
larger in diameter, the medium grade of shot particles being essentially between

425 and 600 µm in diameter.
The method of anyone of claims 1 to 5, in which for producing decorative
laminates having a textured surface of at least 95 % peened coverage is

more than eight peening operations.
The method of anyone of claims 1 to 6, in which the textured surface is formed
by shot peening the surface simultaneously with a mixture of ceramic shot

particles.
The method of claim 7, in which the textured surface of the press plate having
at least 95 % peening coverage is obtained by impact of the mixture of ceramic

shot particles through no more than four peening operations.
The method of anyone of claims 1 to 8, in which for re-finishing the surface of
a press plate used in the manufacture of decorative laminate with at least 95 %

surface peening coverage by ceramic shot peening, a ceramic shot mixture of a
diametrical particle size essentially between 5 and 250 µm in diameter is

propelled onto said surface for adjusting the gloss level of the plate.
