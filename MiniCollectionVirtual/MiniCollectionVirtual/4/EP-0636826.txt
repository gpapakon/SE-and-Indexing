<ABSTRACT>
Clamping collar consisting of a metal strip (1) wound around itself and having, close to one of its ends, a lug (2) equipped with an extension (4) and, having a hook (3) at the other end. The extension (4) has a projecting part (4a) of transverse dimensions smaller than that of the free edge (3a) of the hook (3) and capable of interacting with means for pre-attaching the collar in the unclamped state. The free end (3a) of the hook (3) has a notch (5) the dimensions of which are adapted to those of the projecting part (4a) and which is offset (d) relative to the latter in the transverse direction of the strip. A portion (6) of the free edge (3a) of the hook is situated in the alignment of the projecting part (4a) and is capable of being clipped behind the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A clamp fitting constituted by a metal band (1; 11) wound on 
itself, presenting near one of its ends a double radial fold (2; 12), called ear, 

projecting outwardly of the clamp and equipped with an extension (4; 14) 
extending substantially along the periphery of the clamp, the other end of 

said band being provided with a hook (3; 13) capable of being hooked 
behind the ear (2; 12) after the clamp is tightened, the extension (4; 14) 

presenting a projecting part (4a; 14a) of which the transverse dimension is 
less than that of the free edge (3a; 13a) of the hook and which projecting 

part is spaced apart from the ear (2; 12) in the peripheral sense by a 
distance at least equal to the thickness of the free edge (3a; 13a) of the 

hook (3; 13), said part (4a; 14a) projecting radially towards the outside of 
the clamp and being capable of cooperating with pre-hooking means when 

the clamp is in non-tightened state, characterized: 

in that the free edge (3a; 13a) of the hook (3; 13) presents a 
notch (5; 15) whose transverse dimension and radial height allow the 

projecting part (4a; 14a) through, 
in that said notch and said projecting part are offset (d; d') with 
respect to one another in the transverse sense of the band (1; 11), 
and in that the pre-hooking means comprise a portion (6; 16) 
of the free edge (3a; 13a) of the hook (3; 13), called pre-hooking portion, 

capable of being hooked behind the projecting part (4a; 14a), close to the 
notch (5; 15) and located in line, along the periphery of the clamp, with said 

projecting part. 
The clamp according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises means (4a, 6a) for aligning the transverse positions of the notch 

(5) and of the projecting part (4a), capable of being employed when the two 
ends of the band (1) are being brought together. 
A hook according to claim 2, characterized in that the pre-hooking 
portion (6) is provided with a ramp (6a), inclined towards the inside 

of the hook (3) with respect to an axis transverse to the band (1) and 
extending at least in the vicinity of the notch (5), and in that the projecting 

part (4a) presents an inclination (Î±) substantially parallel to that of said 
ramp.  

 
The clamp according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the projecting part (4a) is constituted by the curved end of the 

extension (4). 
The clamp according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
extension (4) comprises a first section (7a) adjacent to the ear (2), of 

transverse dimension substantially equal to that of said ear, and a second 
section (7b) whose free end is provided with the projecting part (4a), the 

transverse dimensions of this second section and of the projecting part 
being substantially equal to one another and less than that of the first 

section. 
The clamp according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the extension (14) forming sole and extending, when the clamp is in 

tightened state, at least beneath the hook (13), the projecting part (14a) is 
constituted by a portion cut out in said sole (14) and radially straightened up 

with respect thereto.
