<ABSTRACT>
A contact element of a plug-in connector in 
which the peeled portions of electric wires are inserted 

includes a substantially U-shaped conductive plate and a 
leaf-like spring member. The conductive plate is formed 

by bending and constituted by a proximal end portion 
having a plurality of electric wire insertion holes and 

long and short bent pieces bent at two edges of said 
proximal end portion. The leaf-like spring member has 

one end side caught by the long bent piece of the 
conductive plate and a plurality of strip-like tongue 

pieces that are to be engaged with the inner side of 
said short bent piece and extending obliquely from the 

other end side thereof toward the long bent piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plug-in 
connector capable of simply and appropriately connecting 
an electric wire with another electric wire only by 
inserting one end portion of the electric wire. In a plug-in connector of this type, a contact 
element comprising a conductive plate for connecting 
electric wires with each other and a spring piece for 
urging an electric wire against the conductive plate is 
incorporated in a holder made of a heat-resistant 
insulating member. Wire connection can be easily 
performed by anybody only by peeling the coatings on the 
connection ends of electric wires to be connected and 
inserting the peeled portions through the insertion 
ports of the holder. Hence, plug-in connectors having 
various types of structures are conventionally known, 
e.g., one disclosed in Japanese Utility Model 
Publication Nos. 1-22228, 1-29738, and the like. One of the requirements of this plug-in 
connector is a simple and assembly-facilitated pressure 
contact structure by means of the contact element of an 
electric wire. According to this structure, peeled 
portions of the electric wires as electric wire  
 
connection ends can be easily inserted in the holder, 
and after insertion, the peeled electric wire portions 
are reliably prevented from removal from the holder, so 
that the contact element and the electric wire peeled 
ends by pressure connection in this state can 
electrically contact each other with a high reliability. More specifically, a conventional contact 
element comprising a conductive plate made of a copper 
member or the like and a leaf spring having a spring 
piece for urging the peeled electric wire portions 
against the conductive plate is used. Of the 
conventional contact elements, however, one which not 
only has a simple structure and can be assembled easily, 
but also can satisfy easy insertion of the peeled 
electric wire portions to be inserted, reliable 
electrical connection by ensuring a contact area and a 
contact pressure, and prevention of the inserted peeled 
electric wire portions from removal has not yet been 
proposed. Especially, in most of the conventional 
contact elements, when the proximal end portion of a 
leaf spring is to be fixed on a conductive plate, a 
plurality of electric wire insertion holes are formed in 
one plate portion of an L-shaped bent conductive plate, 
a caulking piece is provided on the outer end of the 
conductive plate, and projecting portions provided to 
part of the caulking piece are caulked through holes
