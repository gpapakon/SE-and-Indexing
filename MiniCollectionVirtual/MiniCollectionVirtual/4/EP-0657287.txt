<ABSTRACT>
A magazine (1) is described for automatically exchanging printing plates in printing machines, in particular sheet-fed offset printing machines, the magazine (1) being used to receive a plurality of new printing plates (3.1; 3.2...) which can be fed to the plate cylinder (11) by means of an assigned conveying device (8, 9). A magazine of this type is to be improved to the effect that flexibility is guaranteed in respect of the sequence of the printing plates to be removed. This is achieved in that a switchable holding device (5.1; 5.2...) is provided for each printing plate which can be made available in the magazine. The sequence of removal of these printing plates is thus no longer determined by the sequence in which the printing plates are placed in the magazine.

Magazine (1) for the automatic printing plate change 
on printing presses, particularly offset sheet 

printing presses, wherein the magazine (1) serves to 
receive several new printing plates (3.1 - 3.4) 

which can be fed by a coordinated transport device 
(8, 9, 10) to the plate cylinder (11), characterised 

in that in the magazine (1), there is arranged 
relative to each new printing plate (3.1 - 3.4) to 

be received a switchable holding device (5.1 - 5.4). 
Magazine according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the magazine (1) has a compartment (4.1 - 4.4) for 

each new printing plate (3.1 - 3.4) to be received. 
Magazine according to Claim 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the new printing plates (3.1 - 3.4) can be 

inserted into the magazine (1) in vertical 
orientation. 
Magazine according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the printing plates (3.1 - 3.4) to be made ready in 

the magazine (1) can be set with their front edge on 
the correspondingly arranged swi
tchable holding 
units (5.1 - 5.4). 
Magazine according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the switchable holding devices (5.1 - 5.4) 

arranged relative to the printing plates (3.1 - 3.4) 
are arranged staggered with respect to one another 

in the vertical orientation. 
Magazine according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
there is arranged below the switchable holding 

devices (5.1 - 5.4) arranged vertically staggered 
with respect to one another is a feed surface (7)  

 
running inclined towards the printing unit (2). 
Magazine according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the magazine (1) is installed 

vertically slidable in front of the printing unit 
(2). 
Magazine according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the printing plate (3.1 - 3.4) 

removable by corresponding switching of the holding 
device (5.1 - 5.4) from the magazine (1) can be fed 

via a transport unit (8, 9, 10) set on the print 
unit to the plate cylinder (11). 
Magazine according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the magazine (1) has a feed 

unit by means of which a printing plate (3.1 - 3.4) 
released by the corresponding holding device (5.1 - 

5.4) can be fed out from the magazine (1). 
Magazine at least according to Claim 1 and 4, 
characterised in that the switchable holding devices 

(5.1 - 5.4) are constructed as stops which can be
