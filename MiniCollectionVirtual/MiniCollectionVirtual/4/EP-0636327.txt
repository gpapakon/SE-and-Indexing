<ABSTRACT>
A device for mounting a drawer front panel (4) to the drawer side walls (17), having a holding part (7) fixed to the front panel (4) and a supporting part fixed to a drawer side wall (17), on each side of the drawer. The holding parts (7) can be coupled to the supporting parts and a spring (6) is provided. The spring (6), preferably a helical spring, is active in the longitudinal direction of the drawer side wall (17) between the supporting part and the holding part (7). When the front panel (4) is mounted, a limited relative movement of the holding part (7) with respect to the supporting part counter to the spring action is possible.

holding part (7) is provided with two dowels (19) and two 

spreading pins (34), the spreading pins (34) being connected by 
way of a yoke part (40) which has the stop for the press-in ram 

(14). 
Apparatus according to Claim 12, characterized in that the 
holding part (7) has a lateral cutout (24) on the wall of which 

is constructed the stop for the press-in ram (14).
