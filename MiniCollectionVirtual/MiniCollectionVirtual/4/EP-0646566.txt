<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of acid chloride compounds. J.C.S. Chem.Comm (1977), 808-9 discloses a process 
for preparing aromatic acid chlorides. The process 
involves reacting substituted benzylidyne chlorides with 
hexamethyldisiloxane in the presence of iron (III) 
chloride to produce the corresponding substituted benzoyl 
chloride. In the reaction, trimethylchlorosilane is 
produced which must be hydrolysed back to 
hexamethyldisiloxane for re-use. J.O.C. (1960), 1115-7 discloses a process of metal 
halide catalysed hydrolysis of trichloromethyl compounds 
to form acids. For example, the document discloses that 
(trichloromethyl)benzene may be reacted with water in the 
presence of ferric chloride and chloroform as a solvent to 
produce benzoic acid. US 1557154 discloses a process for the 
manufacture of benzoyl chloride in which 
trichloromethylbenzene is hydrolysed in the presence of 
a catalyst comprising an anhydrous zinc salt such as 
anhydrous zinc chloride. This invention is based upon the discovery of a novel 
process for preparing acid chloride compounds. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a process for preparing a compound of 
general formula 
 
where Ar represents an optionally substituted aromatic or 
heteroaromatic group, the process comprising reacting a 
compound of general formula  
 
Ar-C(L1)2Cl 
where each L1 independently represents a leaving group, 
with water in the presence of a Lewis acid and a 
solvent characterised in that the solvent is 1,2-dichloroethane. It is believed that the two chlorine atoms of the 
solvent may form a transition state or intermediate in the 
reaction which aids the preferential formation of the 
desired acid chloride of general formual I. Preferably, each L1 independently represents a halogen 
atom. Preferred halogen atoms are chlorine, bromine and 
iodine atoms. Preferably, both of said groups L1 represent 
a chlorine atom. Said Lewis acid is preferably a weak Lewis acid. 
Said Lewis acid is preferably a halide of a transition 
metal. Preferably, said Lewis acid is a chloride of a 
transition metal. Preferred transition metals include 
iron, gallium and antimony. Preferred Lewis acids include 
FeCl3, GaCl3 and SbCl5. Most preferably, the Lewis acid is 
ferric chloride (FeCl3). Said Lewis acid, for example ferric chloride, is 
preferably substantially anhydrous. Preferably, a catalytic amount of said Lewis acid is 
added in said process. For example, the molar ratio of 
said Lewis
