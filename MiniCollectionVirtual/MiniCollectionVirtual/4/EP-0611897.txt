<ABSTRACT>
A nonsynchronized positive clutch system (200) is provided for selectively 
rotationally coupling and decoupling a first (46) and a second (42) independently rotatable 

members. The clutch system includes clutch members (50, 42A) each carrying a number 
(N) of interengagable clutch teeth (208, 210) which is maximized in view of pitch 

diameter (214), clutch backlash (216) and durability considerations. By increasing the 
number of clutch teeth, relative to the prior art (200P), smoother shifting and/or reduced 

risk of missed engagements is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved structure for nonsynchronized positive 
clutches of the type comprising a first clutch member fixed for rotation, with a degree of 
rotational freedom, to a first rotatable device and selectively engagable with a second 
clutch member rotatable with a second rotatable device. The first clutch member is 
typically splined to a shaft for rotation therewith and axial movement relative thereto and 
is selectively axially movable relative to a gear carrying the second clutch member for 
selectively engaging and disengaging the positive clutch to selectively rotationally couple 
and decouple the gear to and from the shaft. More particularly, the present invention relates to an axially engagable and 
disengagable nonsynchronized positive clutch structure wherein the member of 
interengagable clutch teeth carried by the clutch members is considerably greater 
(preferably at least fifty percent greater, more preferably at least one hundred percent 
greater) than the number of clutch teeth utilized with the corresponding nonsynchronized 
positive clutch structures of the prior art. Nonsynchronized positive clutch systems for selectively rotationally coupling and 
decoupling a first rotatable device, such as a gear, to a second rotatable device, such as a 
shaft, are, of course, well known in the prior art. Change gear transmissions utilizing 
such positive clutches, without synchronizing mechanisms to minimize the cost, size 
and/or complexity thereof, are well known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to 
United States Patent Nos. 2,951,395; 3,105,395; 3,335,616; 3,500,695; 3,799,002; 
4,388,838; 4,754,665; 5,000,060 and 5,052,535. The clutch members of nonsynchronized positive clutch systems are, preferably, 
provided with clutch teeth having a leading edge structure which, during a clutch 
engagement, will tend to cause the clutch members to ratchet rather than engage if the  
 
relative rotational speeds thereof exceed a predetermined value. An example of such a 
clutch tooth structure may be seen by reference to United States Patent No. 3,265,173. 
As is known, for a given 
engagement force, the maximum allowable relative rotational speed at which the positive 
clutches will properly engage (i.e. sufficient clutch tooth penetration will occur) is a 
directly proportional function of the total effective backlash in the clutch system. The 
maximum allowable asynchronous conditions at which clutch engagement is allowed is 
selected in view of the most harsh clutch
