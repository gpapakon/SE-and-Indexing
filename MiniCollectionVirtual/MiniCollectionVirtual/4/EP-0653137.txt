<ABSTRACT>
In the rack proposed, a separate assembly (3) is provided for each subscriber, the plug-in assemblies being mounted on carrier plates (2). The carrier are held in the rack (1) in several planes, located parallel to each other, in such a way that they can be swung out of the rack and back and are thus readily accessible. The end section of the cables (5) run, in the neighbourhood of the pivot axes, parallel to these axes and rotate about themselves with little deformation when a carrier plate is swung out of the rack.
