<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a seal (10) for sealing and re-sealing a bag, in particular a bag for storing food e.g. bread, confectionery, pasta. The inventive seal comprises a strip (12) made of a plastic material which can be applied around the gathered neck (15) of the bag in such a way that the side (16) facing the bag of one end (20) of the strip (22) overlaps the outer side (22) of the other end (18), and is fixed in this position. The seal (10) can be closed again after opening. On opening for the first time, the structure of the strip (12) is modified in such a way that it is clear that the bag has been opened. The invention is characterized in that the strip is made of a thermoplastic plastic, and that the overlapping end (20) is welded to the underlying end (18) in such a way that a welding point is visible from the outside, and that, when first opened, an opening forms in the lifted end (20) at the welding point.

A seal for sealing and resealing a bag (14), in
particular a bag for accommodating foodstuffs such as

bread, confectionery or pasta, consisting of a strip
(12, 52) of plastics material, which may be positioned

about the gathered neck (15) of the bag (14) in such a
way that the side (16) facing the bag of one end (20)

of the strip (12, 52) overlaps the other end (18) on
the outside (22) thereof and is fixed in this

position, wherein the seal (10, 50) may be resealed
after opening and, on the occasion of first opening,

such a structural change takes place in the strip (12,
52) that this opening is detectable, 
characterised in
that
 the strip (12, 52) is made of a thermoplastic
material, 
in that
 the overlapping end (20) is welded
to the end (18) therebelow in such a way that a weld

point (24) visible from the outside is present,
wherein the weld point (24) is a spot weld produced by

a welding punch (26) applied to the outside (22) of
the overlapping end (20), and 
in that
 material (28) of
the overlapping end (20) is pressed partially through

the strip (12) and welded to the outside (22) of the
end (18) therebelow, and 
in that
, on the occasion of
first opening, an opening (34, 60) arises in the

overlapping, lifted end (20) at the weld point (24).
A seal according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at
least one tongue (36) which may be bent out of the

strip plane is punched in the strip (12), which tongue
(36) may be hooked into an opening (34) in the strip

(12) upon resealing.
A seal according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the
tongue (36) may be hooked into the opening (34)

arising on the occasion of first opening.
A seal according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 an
elongate h
ole (60) is provided in one end area (58) of 
the strip (50), through which elongate hole (60) the

other, opposing end (61) of the strip, folded inwards
on both sides, may be inserted.
A seal according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the
strip (50) comprises a longitudinally extending groove

(54) centrally on at least one side, about which
groove (54) the end areas (62, 63) of the strip may be

folded laterally.
A seal according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in
that
 the strip (50) is provided along its outer
longitudinal edges with knurling (56, 57).
A seal according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the strip (12, 52) is provided
with a pressure sensitive adhesive on at least one

side.
A bag, 
characterised in that
 it is sealed with a seal
according to one of claims 1 to 7.
A clip unit for applying a strip (12, 52) according to
one of claims 1 to 7 to a bag (14) and for sealing the

clip strip (12, 52), 
characterised in that
 a welding
punch (26) is provided as an auxiliary implement which

may be served up to the closed clip strip (12, 52) on
the outside (22) of the overlapping end (20) thereof.
