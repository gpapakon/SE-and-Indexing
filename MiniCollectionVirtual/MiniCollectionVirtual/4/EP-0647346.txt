<CLAIMS>
A substantially cuboidal packaging container 
composed of two blanks of packaging material, of which 

one comprises a base part with side parts joined thereto 
and the other represents a square lid part and the two 

blanks reach over the lid part by means of foldable 
joining tabs of the side parts, for magnetic recording 

media wound onto hubs provided with internal bores (known 
as pancakes), the internal bores of the winding hubs and 

in each case a central clearance (7) of the base part (1) 
and of the lid part (2) being penetrated by a one-part 

cylindrical sleeve (6, 16), which belongs to the packaging 
container and onto which the pancakes can be stackably 

fitted, wherein the ends of at least two side parts 
(3, 13) can be inserted during the folding up of the pack 

into slits which are provided in the upper end region of 
the sleeve (6, 16), penetrating the hub, said slits 

running in the circumferential direction of said sleeve. 
The packaging container as claimed in Claim 1, 
the ends (3) of the side parts joined to the base part 

(1) tapering triangularly. 
The packaging container as claimed in Claim 1, 
the four side parts being of a substantially rectangular 

design, two mutually opposite side parts (14, 17) having 
side tabs (15) on both sides in each case and the two 

further mutually opposite side parts having at their 
outer edge insert tabs (18), bounded by incisions, for 

insertion into two slits at the upper end of the sleeve 
(16). 
The packaging container as claimed in one of 
Claims 1 to 3, base part and lid part consisting of 

cardboard, and sleeve (6, 16) consisting of hard plastic.
