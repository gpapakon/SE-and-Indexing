<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a melamine resin foam,
and a process for production thereof.Melamine resin foams are produced from a resin composition
comprising, as main components, a melamine/formaldehyde resin
(which is a thermosetting resin obtained by the reaction of melamine and
formaldehyde) and a blowing agent. Among organic resin foams, melamine
resin foams show excellent flame retardancy and are regarded to
be useful particularly as a heat insulating construction material. The
melamine resin foams, however, are very fragile generally with the fragility
being conspicuous in the case of highly expanded foams, causing
cracking. Hence, the melamine resin foams see no practical application 
yet in spite of their excellent flame retardancy mentioned above.For the realization of the practical application of melamine
resin foams, many researches have been made. For example, in
Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid Open) No. 17697/1978 is disclosed
a process for producing a melamine resin foam by adding, to a
melamine/formaldehyde condensate, 12-330% by weight, based on the
resin, of an isocyanate and giving rise to foaming in the presence of a
catalyst using no blowing agent. However, addition of such a large
amount of an isocyanate produces a melamine resin foam of low flame
retardancy.Further in Japanese Patent Publication No. 50943/1990
is disclosed a process for producing an elastic foam (which uses a melamine/formaldehyde
condensate as a basic material and which is free
from problems of fragility and flame retardancy and has good properties)
by applying an ultrahigh frequency to a solution comprising a melamine/formaldehyde
precondensate, a blowing agent and other substances.As well known, when an ultrahigh frequency is applied
to a metal, discharge takes place. The above solution comprising a melamine/formaldehyde
precondensate, a blowing agent and other substances 
contains, in most cases, a combustible solvent (in the above Japanese
Patent Publication No. 50943/1990, there are mentioned, as the
blowing agent used, hydrocarbons, alcohols, etc.). In this connection, if
the above solution containing a melamine/formaldehyde
precondensate, a blowing agent and other substances contains a metal,
the application of an ultrahigh frequency to the solution causes discharge
and quite possibly allows the solution to catch a fire. Thus, the
process disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 50943/1990 is not
suitable at least for use on industrial scale.EP-A-0 040 720 describes the use of
