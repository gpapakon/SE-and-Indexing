<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to secondary 
(rechargeable) batteries which utilize electrodes comprising 
intercalation compounds, principally lithiated ternary 
transtion metal oxides, such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, and LiNiO2. 
In particular, the invention yields an improved electrolyte 
element which serves to more effectively separate the battery 
electrodes while providing a highly functional and economical 
electrolytic medium for the intercalation process. Early secondary lithium battery structures typically 
comprised an elemental lithium metal negative electrode 
physically separated from a positive electrode of 
intercalatable compound by an electrically insulating element 
which served a secondary role as a means of immobilizing a fluid 
electrolyte for the system. Although some success has been 
reported in the use of a unique solid electrolyte (Meunier et 
al., Mat. Sci. and Eng., B3 (1989) 19-23), commercially 
feasible electrolyte elements have for the most part been 
sheets or films of porous materials, such as glass fiber filter 
paper or cloth (U.S. 4,751,159) and microporous polyethylene or 
polypropylene film or nonwoven cloth (Ohzuku et al., 
J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 137, No.1, 1990) saturated with 
solutions of lithium compounds, typically LiClO4 or LiBF4 in 
propylene carbonate, diethoxyethane, or other organic solvent 
(U.S. 4,828,834). These separator/electrolyte elements were not wholly 
satisfactory, however, due to their relatively great thickness, 
which resulted in excessive separation between electrodes, and 
their large pore size, which allowed a dangerous level of  
 
lithium dendrite formation at the positive electrode upon 
recharging. Glass fiber cloth, for example, resulted in 
electrode separation of about 300 micrometers while providing 
restrictive channeling down to only about 250 nanometers. Some 
improvement was provided by costly microporous polyethylene 
membranes of about 50 micrometer thickness, but these elements 
were difficult to individually maneuver into battery structures 
and presented the additional disadvantage of low strength and 
excessive thermal sensitivity. There has since been substantial improvement in battery 
components, such as by the substitution of lithium intercalated 
compounds for hazardously reactive lithium metal. The most 
practical electrolytes from the standpoint of functionality, 
reasonable cost, and ease of handling continue, however, to be 
the organic solutions containing lithium ion salts. The present 
invention, therefore,
