<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive disc, in particular a cutting-off disc, has an annular-cylindrical inner supporting body (2) made of metal and an abrasive ring (1) surrounding the latter, these being interconnected. The abrasive ring (1) projects beyond the supporting body (2) on both sides in the direction of the common axis (4). The abrasive ring (1) can be worn down completely. The supporting body (2) is reusable or at least recyclable.

An abrasive wheel for hand-guided grinding machines, in particular an
abrasive cutting-off wheel, comprising an inner support (2, 2'') and an abrasive

ring (1) connected with the latter and having a synthetic resin bonding
of the abrasive grit (15), the annular-disk-type abrasive ring (1) having a

recess (3) formed concentrically of a central longitudinal axis (4) and in
which the annular-disk-type support (2, 2'') is arranged and connected with

the abrasive ring (1),
characterized
in that
 the abrasive ring (1) has at least one reinforcement layer (14, 14'),
in that the support (2, 2'') consists of metal sheet,
in that the thickness (e) of the support (2'') is distinctly less than the thickness
(a) of the abrasive ring (1), and
in that, at its outer circumference, the support (2'') is provided with a substantially
annular cylindrical rim (24), of which the length (b) in the direction

of the central longitudinal axis (4) is greater than the thickness (e) of
the support (2'') and to the outer circumferential surface (9'') of which the

abrasive ring (1) is secured.
An abrasive wheel according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 1.4 ≤ Da/Di ≤ 2 applies to the ratio which the outside diameter (Da)
bears to the inside diameter (Di) of the abrasive ring (1).
An abrasive wheel according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the support (2, 2'') is glued in the recess (3) of the abrasive ring (1).
An abrasive wheel according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the support (2'') has a thickness (e) of 0.4 mm ≤ e ≤ 1.0 mm and
preferably 0.5 mm ≤ e ≤ 0.8 mm.
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
in that
 0.8 a ≤ b ≤ 1.0 a applies to the axial length (b) of the rim (24) as
compared to the thickness (a) of the abrasive ring (1).
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
in that
 the support (2'') is provided with ribs (23) around a receiving aperture
(13) formed concentrically of i
ts central longitudinal axis (4).
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
in that
 the abrasive ring (1), by at least one front face (5), projects from a
front face (6) of the support (2, 2'').
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized
in that
 the inner circumferential surface (8), defining the recess (3), of the
abrasive ring (1) and/or the outer circumferential surface (9, 9'') of the support

(2, 2'') are cylindrical.
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized
in that
 the reinforcement layer (14, 14') comprises reinforcing threads (18)
extending tangentially in the vicinity of a central opening (19) and radially

tangentially towards the outer circumference and which are deflected at the
outer circumference.
An abrasive wheel according to claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 the reinforcing threads (18) extend tangentially and radially tangentially
in a straight line.
An abrasive wheel according to claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 the reinforcing threads (18) partially spiral from the central opening
(19) towards the outer circumference.
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 9 to 11, 
characterized
in that
 the reinforcement threads (18) are glued together at their intersections
(20).
An abrasive wheel according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the abrasive grit (15) is partially forced into the outer circumferential
surface (9'') of the rim (24).
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized
in that
 the abrasive ring (1) has a polycondensation adhesive as a bonding
agent (16).
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized
in that
 the outer circumferential surface (9'') of the rim (24) is provided
with a layer (25) of glue of the same kind as the bonding agent (16) of the

abrasive ring (1).
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterized
in that
 0.1 a ≤ e ≤ 0.25 a applies to the thickness (e) of the support (2'') in
relation to the thickness (a) of the abrasive ring (1).
