<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel antiviral compounds, refered to as calanolides, and their derivatives of formulae (I) and (II) which may be isolated from plants of the genus Calophyllum in accordance with the present inventive method. The compounds and their derivatives may be used alone or in combination with other antiviral agents in compositions, such as pharmaceutical compositions, to inhibit the growth or replication of a virus, such as a retrovirus, in particular a human immunodeficiency virus, specifically HIV-1 or HIV-2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antiviral compounds, in
particular antiviral compounds isolated from plants of
the genus Calophyllum, specifically compounds referred to
as calanolides. This invention also relates to methods
of isolating calanolides from Calophyllum plants,
compositions comprising calanolides, and methods of using
the compositions in clinical applications, such as
antiviral therapy and the prevention of viral infection.Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a very
serious disease, reported cases of which have increased
dramatically within the past several years. Estimates of
reported cases in the very near future also continue to
rise dramatically. Consequently, there is a great effort
to develop drugs and vaccines to combat AIDS.The AIDS virus was first identified in 1983. It has
been known by several names and acronyms. It is the
third known T-lymphocyte virus (HTLV-III), and it has the
capacity to replicate within cells of the immune system,
causing profound cell destruction. The AIDS virus is a
retrovirus, a virus that uses reverse transcriptase
during replication. This particular retrovirus is also
known as lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), AIDS-related
virus (ARV) and, most recently, as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two distinct types of HIV
have been described to date, namely HIV-1 and HIV-2. The
acronym HIV will be used herein to refer to HIV viruses
generically.Specifically, HIV is known to exert a profound
cytopathic effect on the CD4+ helper/inducer T-cells,
tnereby severely compromising the immune system. HIV 
infection also results in neurological deterioration and,
ultimately, in the death of the infected individual.The field of viral chemotherapeutics has developed
in response to the need for agents effective against
retroviruses, in particular HIV. There are many ways in
which an agent can exhibit anti-retroviral activity. For
example, HIV requires at least four viral proteins for
replication: reverse transcriptase (RT), protease,
transactivator protein (TAT), and regulator of virion-protein
expression (REV). Accordingly, viral replication
could theoretically be inhibited through inhibition of
any one or all of the proteins involved in viral
replication.Anti-retroviral agents, such as AZT and ddC, are
known to inhibit RT. There also exist anti-viral agents
that inhibit TAT.Nucleoside derivatives, such as AZT, are the only
clinically active agents that are currently available for
antiviral therapy. Although very useful, the utility of
AZT and related compounds
