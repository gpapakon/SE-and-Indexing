<ABSTRACT>
A process for the fluid catalytic cracking of 
heavy fraction oils containing heavy metals such as Ni 

and V, which comprises withdrawing a portion of 
ferrite-containing catalyst particles circulating in a 

fluid catalytic cracking apparatus, separating the thus 
withdrawn catalyst particles into metals-richly 

deposited catalyst particles and metals-poorly 
deposited ones by using a magnetic separator and then 

returning the metals-poorly deposited catalyst 
particles, together with fresh ferrite-containing 

catalyst particles, into said cracking apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fluid catalytic
cracking of heavy fraction oils to obtain therefrom
light fraction oils such as gasoline and kerosene.
More particularly, it relates to such a process which
comprises catalytically cracking, in the presence of a
particulate iron oxide (ferrite)-containing catalyst,
heavy fraction oils containing 0.5 ppm or more in total
of at least nickel and vanadium.In conventional catalytic cracking, petroleum-derived
hydrocarbons are contacted with a catalyst for
cracking thereby to obtain a large quantity of light
oil fractions such as LPG and gasoline as well as a
small quantity of a cracked light oil, with coke
deposited on the catalyst being burnt with air for
removal thereof to enable the thus treated catalyst to
be recycled for reuse. As starting oils in this case,
there have heretofore been mainly used so-called
distillates such as light gas oil (LGO) and heavy gas
oil (HGO) from an atmospheric-pressure distilling
column and vacuum gas oil (VGO) from a reduced-pressure
distilling column.However, due to the recent worldwide need to use
heavier crude oils and due to changes in demand for
petroleum products in, for example, Japan, there has
been a tendency to overproduce heavy oils. This has
been appreciated from the twin standpoints of demand
and supply of the petroleum products. Therefore, it
has been necessary for heavy fraction oils including
distillation residues to be used as starting oils in a
catalytic cracking process.It is known, however, that heavy fraction oils,
including distillation residues, contain metals such as
nickel, vanadium, iron, copper and sodium in a far 
greater total amount than distillates, and that these
metals will be deposited on a catalyst thereby
hindering the activity and selectivity of the catalyst
when the catalyst is used in catalytic cracking. In
other words, the cracking rate will gradually decrease
as the metals accumulate on the catalyst thereby making
it substantially impossible to attain a desired
cracking rate, while the amount of hydrogen evolved and
the amount of coke produced will increase remarkably
thereby making it difficult to operate equipment for
carrying out the cracking. Further, at the same time,
desired liquid products will be obtained in a decreased
yield. Among said metals, particularly vanadium will
destroy zeolite which is the active component of the
catalyst and thereby lower the catalytic activity of
the catalyst. Nickel does not decrease catalytic
activity like vanadium does, but it will remarkably
increa

A continuously operating process for the fluid
catalytic cracking of a heavy fraction oil containing

nickel and vanadium in a total amount of at least 0.5
ppm in a fluid catalytic cracking apparatus provided

with a reaction zone, a stripping zone and a
regenerating zone, which comprises the steps of


(i) continuously feeding the heavy fraction oil to
the cracking apparatus to undergo contact with

particulate ferrite-containing catalyst particles

having a saturation magnetization of not more than
10 emu/g before being introduced into the fluid

catalytic cracking apparatus, thereby to crack the

of lighter hydrocarbon oils and unreacted heavy
fraction oils is obtained;
(ii) separating the catalyst particles to which
carbonaceous substances and a part of the

hydrocarbon mixture are attached, from the
remaining greater part of the hydrocarbon mixture,

in the stripping zone;
(iii) subjecting the catalyst particles thus
separated to oxidizing treatment in the

regenerating zone to decrease the content of
carbonaceous substances and the hydrocarbon

mixture attached to the catalyst particles,
thereby to obtain regenerated catalyst particles;
