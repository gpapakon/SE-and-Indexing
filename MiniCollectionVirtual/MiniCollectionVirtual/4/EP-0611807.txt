<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic materials, and
more particularly, to photographic materials containing a new type
of light-absorbing non-sensitizing dye.Light-absorbing dyes incorporated in silver halide photographic
materials can accomplish a variety of goals, including their use as
filter dyes, acutance dyes or anti-halation dyes.When present in a non-photosensitive top layer or intermediate
layer they typically serve as filter dyes eliminating an unwanted
part of the light spectrum of the exposure source. A well-known
example is the yellow filter layer usually present in colour
photographic materials in order to prevent blue light from reaching
the green sensitive and red sensitive layers. Another example is
formed by UV-absorbing compounds, usually present in the top
protective layer, which prevent photochemical deterioration of the
image dyes formed by colour development. Examples of useful UV-absorbers
include the cyanomethyl sulfone-derived merocyanines of
US-P 3,723,154, the thiazolidones, benzotriazoles and
thiazolothiazoles of US-P 2,739,888, 3,253,921, 3,250,617 and
2,739,971, the triazoles of US-P 3,004,896, and the hemioxonols of
US-P 3,125,597.On the other hand light-absorbing dyes when present in the
emulsion layer can serve as so-called "acutance dyes" or "screening
dyes" improving the image sharpness by reducing the sidewise
scattering of light by the emulsion grains.In a third application light-absorbing dyes act as "anti-halation
dyes" improving the image sharpness by diminishing the
upward reflection of light by the support into the emulsion layer.
For this purpose the dye can be incorporated in an undercoat, being
a non-photosensitive layer between the emulsion layer and the
support, or it can be incorporated in the base itself, or
preferably, it can be present in one or more backing layers of the
photographic material.Useful dyes absorbing in the visible spectral region include,
for instance, the coloured pigments of US-P 2,697,037, the 
pyrazolone oxonol dyes of US-P 2,274,782, the styryl and butadienyl
dyes of US-P 3,423,207, the diaryl azo dyes of US-P 2,956,879, the
merocyanine dyes of US-P 2,527,583, the merocyanine and oxonol dyes
of US-P 3,486,897, US-P 3,652,284 and 3,718,472, and the
enaminohemioxonol dyes of US-P 3,976,661. Absorbing dyes can be
added as particulate dispersions as disclosed in US-P 4.092,168,
EP 0 274 723 and EP 0 299 435.Infra-red absorbing dyes are described in EP 0 251 282, in
EP 0 288 076, and in US-P 4,839,265.Dyes absorbing in the red
