<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor integrated circuit, a plurality of thin film 
transistors (TFTs) are formed on the same substrate having an 

insulating surface. Since gate electrodes formed in the TFTs are 
electrically insulated each other, voltages are applied 

independently to gate electrodes in an electrolytic solution during 
an anodization, to form an anodic oxide in at least both sides of 

each gate electrode. A thickness of the anodic oxide is changed in 
accordance with characteristics of the TFT. A width of high 

resistance regions formed in an active layer of each TFT is changed 
by ion doping using the anodic oxide having a desired thickness as 

a mask.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin film shaped integrated 
circuit comprising a plurality of thin film insulated gate 
semiconductor devices such as thin film transistors (TFTs) formed 
on an insulating surface, and to a method of fabricating the 
integrated circuit. Semiconductor devices according to the 
invention can be used in active matrix circuits of electro-optical 
devices such as liquid crystal displays, in driver circuits for 
image sensors, in SOI integrated circuits, and in conventional 
semiconductor integrated circuits (e.g., microprocessors, 
microcontrollers, microcomputers, semiconductor memories, and so 
on). More particularly, the invention relates to a monolithic thin 
film integrated circuit comprising an active matrix circuit and 
drivers for driving the circuit are formed on the same substrate or 
memories and a CPU are formed on the same substrate and to a method 
of fabricating the monolithic thin film integrated circuit. In recent years, researches on a method of fabricating an 
insulated gate semiconductor device (MISFET) either on an 
insulating substrate or an insulating surface has been conducted. 
The insulating surface is insulated from the semiconductor 
substrate by a thick insulating film. A semiconductor device in 
which a semiconductor layer (active layer) has the form of a thin 
film is called a thin film transistor (TFT). It is difficult to 
obtain good crystallinity corresponding to the crystallinity of a 
single crystal semiconductor. Therefore, a non-single crystal 
semiconductor is commonly used. Such a non-single crystal semiconductor is inferior in 
characteristics to a single crystal semiconductor. Especially, 
when a reverse voltage (a negative voltage in the case of an N-channel 
TFT and a positive voltage in the case of a P-channel TFT)  
 
is applied to the gate electrode, the leakage current between the 
source and drain increases and the mobility of the TFT reduces. 
Therefore, it is necessary to form an intrinsic or weak P- or N-type 
high resistance region between the source/drain regions and 
the gate electrode. For example, where high resistance regions are formed, at least 
the side surfaces of a gate insulating film are oxidized by 
anodization or other method, and doping is done by a self-alignment 
utilizing the oxide or its trace. In this way, high resistance 
regions having a uniform width can be obtained. However, such a high resistance region acts also as a resistor 
inserted in series between the source and drain. Therefore, where
