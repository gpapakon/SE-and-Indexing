<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a new kind of case, the central compartment of 
which can be reached from two or more separate openings, placed 

on its sides and/or on its upper part, in such a way as to 
ensure easy access to all the zones of the central compartment 

without the need to take out or move its content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns travelling articles and in 
particular cases and bags. There are cases with one opening 
allowing the access to the sole internal compartment and also 
cases with the central compartment divided in two sectors, which 
make it necessary to remove the partition in order to reach the 
sectors. Some of the above mentioned cases are equipped also with lateral 
external pockets, meant to contain small objects or documents. In the traditional medium- and large-sized cases and bags, in 
order to reach and take out the objects placed furthest from the 
opening it is necessary to take out, or, at least, to move, many 
objects, thus creating confusion inside the case. None of the known kinds of bags allows to put the objects in the 
case from a particular side, in order to position and transport 
them in the best conditions; further, none of the known kinds of 
cases allows the access to the different zones, making it 
possible to reach the objects that are inside the case 
immediately. In order to eliminate all the above mentioned inconveniences, a 
new kind of case has been designed and carried out.  The new case has openings that are independent one of the other, 
placed on two or more sides and giving access to the same 
central compartment. The sides provided with an opening in order to allow the access 
to the central compartment are preferably contiguous and 
lateral, but it is also possible to have them on the opposite 
sides of the case or, if necessary, on its upper part and on one 
side. The case can be also provided with zip openings with two sliding 
tabs on the same zip, so that it is possible to reach the 
central compartment from four different openings, thus having 
the opportunity to reach the desired zone immediately and to 
take out the needed object without throwing into disorder the 
content of the case. The new case can be made of any material, either rigid or 
flexible; the closing elements of the walls may consist 
preferably of zips with single or double sliding tab, or of any 
other system, provided that it is suitable for the purpose. Two or more openings placed on different walls ensure the access 
to the central compartment of the case. The following is just an example among many of the practical 
applications of the new case, illustrated in the attached 
tables. This new case (V) has two zips (C) on two contiguous sides, each 
one of which links one side (P) with its lateral (L) and upper 
(S) edge (B). Both sips (C) allow the access to the central 
comp
