<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a binding ground plate (10) for the heal and/or toe units of ski bindings with holes (32) for receiving the fastening screws of binding parts. To reduce stresses on the fastening screws passing through the binding ground plate on account of the oscillating motion of the ski during running, the region (24) of the binding ground plate in which the holes for receiving the fastening screws are arranged is largely isolated from the remaining binding plate (12).

A binding base plate (10) for the front or rear jaws of 
ski bindings with holes to receive attachment screws of 

parts of bindings, which extend through said holes,
characterized in
 
that the part (24) of the binding base plate (10), in 

which the holes (20) to receive the attachment screws of 
the ski binding parts are arranged, is substantially 

uncoupled from the rest of the binding plate so that the 
vibrations, which are transmitted from the ski onto the 

entire length of the binding base plate (10), are not 
transmitted in the part with the attachment screws 

extending through the binding base plate (10). 
The binding base plate (10) according to claim 1, 
characterized in that as it main parts it comprises a 

frame (14, 14') and an attachment part (24) resiliently 
borne in the same in a yielding manner. 
The binding base plate according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the attachment part is constituted 

by a tongue (24). 
The binding base plate according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the attachment part (24) is 

connected with the frame (14) by means of ribs (16'). 
The binding base plate according to claim 1, 
characterized in that it is preferably an injection-moulded  

 
synthetic resin part, which is delimited by a 

cover layer (12) and lateral ribs (14), and in that 
further reinforcing ribs (16) are provided underneath 

the cover layer (12). 
The binding base plate according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 5, 
characterized in that one part of the cover layer (12) 

extending around the holes (20) to receive such 
attachments screws is decoupled by means of a partly 

encircling slot (22), said cover layer part (24) being 
coherent with the cover layer surrounding it along a 

given section. 
The binding base plate according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the uncoupled cover layer part has 

a corrugation (26) extending over its full width. 
The binding base plate according to claim 1, 2 or 4, 
characterized in that the holes (32) provided in one 

part of the binding base plate respectively possess a 
casing (34) extending perpendicularly to the support 

plane of the binding base plate, in that such casings 
(34) are connected with one another and partly with the 

lateral ribs (14) forming the frame with ribs (16') 
standing perpendicular on the support surface plane of 

the binding base plate (10), and in that a strip (36), 
which extends in parallelism to the support plane, 

extends from said ribs (16') connected with each other 
in the longitudinal direction of the binding base plate 

(10) to a reinforcing rib of a further part of the 
binding base plate (10) adjoining the same in the 

longitudinal direction.
