<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses novel compositions of matter, in particulate forms, which function as heat transfer agents for heating or cooling applications. The particulates comprise solid carriers containing microwave responsive substances which are liquid at a predetermined elevated operating temperature. These particulate agents, preheated by microwave energy, serve as sources of dry heat or moist heat, depending on their composition. They also serve as sources of cold, when prechilled in a freezer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns materials which can serve as intermediate
agents for transfer of heat from an energy source to a load object. More
specifically, it relates to particulate compositions of matter which can be used
effectively for heating or cooling applications.In a typical heating application, agent B receives heat from source
A and delivers its heat to load object C. The same applies, in principle, to a
cooling application. In that case, agent B receives cold (gives up its heat to)
source A and gives up its cold (receives heat from) load object C. Putting it in
another way, one may consider the load object of cold as a source of heat and
the source of cold as the load object of heat. Thus, intermediate agents play a
similar role in heating and cooling.Examples of common heating and cooling applications come to
mind quite readily. Electric corn poppers or hairdryers use air as the
intermediate heating agent. Pressing irons or frying pans use metal as the
intermediate heating agents. Hot oil is used as an intermediate heating agent in
deep frying and water is used as the primary intermediate heating agent in most
cooking applications. Turning to a common example of cooling, air is the
primary cooling intermediate in a refrigerator. All of the above are instances of
dynamic, steady-state heat transfer, where the intermediate agents receive and
discharge heat concurrently, either intermittently or continuously. Under these
conditions, the agents' ability to transfer heat is of primary importance.In other situations, the process of heat transfer is sequential rather
than concurrent. In such cases, an intermediate heating (cooling) agent receives 
heat (cold) from a source, stores the heat (cold) for later use and then delivers
it to a load object, likely at another location away from the original source.
Sequential heating is exemplified by preheated water in a jacketed baby feeding
dish or in a hot water bottle. A freezer pack is an example of stored cold. It is
clear that in sequential heating/cooling applications, the intermediate agents'
ability to store heat is an important attribute. Measures of capacity to store
heat for materials which do not undergo a change of state relate to specific heat
per unit weight and, in combination with density, specific heat per unit volume.
Changes of state will be considered later.One other attribute worthy of mention is fluidity; i.e., the agents'
ability to flow readily and surround the load object, thereby delivering heat to
more than one surface. It can,
