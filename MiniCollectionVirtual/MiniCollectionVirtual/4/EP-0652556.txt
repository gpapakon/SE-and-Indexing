<ABSTRACT>
A magnetooptical recording medium includes a 
reproduction layer, a first recording layer and a 

second recording layer. The reproduction layer is a 
perpendicular magnetic film in both a state of room 

temperature and a state of temperature rise. In the 
first and second recording layers, sub lattice magnetic 

moments of the same kinds of elements constituting the 
first and second recording layers are oriented in 

opposite directions. In reproducing operation, an 
initialization magnetic field is applied to a portion 

of the recording medium other than a light beam 
irradiated portion. A direction of magnetization of 

the reproduction layer is oriented in a stable 
direction with respect to magnetization of the first 

recording layer by an exchange coupling effect in a 
region at a temperature not less than a middle 

temperature in the irradiated portion. The direction 
of magnetization of the reproduction laye22r is 

oriented in a direction of the initialization magnetic 
field in a low-temperature region. Reproduction of 

information is effected by detecting a magnetooptical 
change in light reflected by the recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptical 
recording medium which is subjected to 
recording/reproduction of information by means of a 
laser beam by utilizing a magnetooptical effect, and a 
magnetooptical reproduction method which can realize a 
high-density medium. As a rewritable high-density recording method, a 
magnetooptical recording medium, on which information 
is recorded by writing a magnetic domain in a magnetic 
thin film using heat energy of a semiconductor laser, 
and from which the recorded information is read out 
using a magnetooptical effect, has received a lot of 
attention. In recent years, a demand for attaining a 
large-capacity recording medium by increasing the 
recording density of such a magnetooptical recording 
medium has increased. The linear recording density of an optical disk 
such as a magnetooptical recording medium largely 
depends on the laser wavelength of a reproduction 
optical system and the numerical aperture of an  
 
objective lens. More specifically, since the diameter 
of a beam waist is determined when a laser wavelength λ 
of the reproduction optical system and a numerical 
aperture NA of the objective lens are determined, the 
minimum resolvable mark period is about λ/2NA. On the other hand, the track density is mainly 
limited by crosstalk. The crosstalk is mainly 
determined by the distribution (profile) of a laser 
beam on the medium surface, and is expressed by a 
function of λ/2NA as in the mark period. Therefore, in order to realize a high density in a 
conventional optical disk, the wavelength of a laser in 
the reproduction optical system must be shortened, and 
the numerical aperture NA of the objective lens must be 
increased. However, it is not easy to shorten the 
wavelength of the laser in terms of problems associated 
with efficiency of the element, generation of heat, and 
the like. On the other hand, when the numerical 
aperture of the objective lens is increased, the 
distance between the lens and the disk becomes too 
small, and a mechanical problem such as collision 
occurs. For this reason, a super-resolution technique 
for increasing the recording density by modifying the 
structure of the recording medium or the method of 
reading the medium has been developed. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 
No. 3-93056 attempts to increase the recording density  
 
by a super-resolution technique using a magnetic 
multi-layered film medium. In this method, as shown 
in, e.g., Figs. 1A to 1C, a light spot 7 is irradiated
