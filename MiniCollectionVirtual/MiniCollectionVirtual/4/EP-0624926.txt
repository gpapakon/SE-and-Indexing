<ABSTRACT>
The connector comprises a socket (10) having two parallel outer side walls, and a plug (12) which can move parallel to the side walls of the socket in the insertion and extraction direction. The plug has fingers projecting outwards, orthogonal to the direction. A brace (U-shaped piece) (14) for inserting and extracting the plug can slide along the side walls orthogonally to the insertion direction. Cut out into the brace are emerging channels for receiving the fingers, these channels being shaped such that the movement of the brace in a first direction causes the fingers to be pushed into the channels from the entrance of the latter. The plug (12) includes elastic catching tabs placed so as to be engaged under the brace (14) at the end of insertion and to retain the clamp.
