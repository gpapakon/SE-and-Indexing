<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an extension plug-in unit comprising a socket (2) connected to a first cable (1) and a plug (4) connected to a second cable (3), said plug (4) and socket (2) having cooperating contact means (5, 6) comprising male and female contacts for electrical connection of the first cable (1) to the second cable (3) and cooperating connecting means (7, 8, 9) for joining the plug (4) mechanically to the socket (2). To enable a mechanically simple and reliable construction, the male and female contacts (5, 6) are disposed to be located substantially in succession in the axial direction of the cables (1, 3), and the mechanical contact means comprise hinge means (7 8) at one end of the plug and the socket for articulated joining of the plug and socket and locking means (9) at the other end of the plug and the socket for locking the plug (4) and socket (2) together at said ends when they are pressed against one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extension 
plug-in unit comprising a socket connected to a first 
cable and a plug connected to a second cable, said plug 
and socket having cooperating contact means comprising 
male and female contacts for electrical connection of 
the first cable to the second cable and cooperating 
connecting means for joining the plug mechanically to 
the socket when their contact means are in contact with 
one another. In a conventional extension plug-in unit, which 
consists of a socket attached to a first cable and a 
plug attached to a second cable, both the socket and 
the plug have a generally cylindrical shape. This cylindrical 
shape presents several problems. First, the 
contacts of the plug and the socket must be located 
within a circular area normally in parallel with their 
attached cables. Since it is not desired to make the 
diameter of the cylinder inordinately large, in extension 
plug-in units for relatively high currents, e.g. 
about 100 A, the connections between the cables and the 
connectors of the plug and the socket must be executed 
in succession in the axial direction. This considerably 
increases the length of both the plug and the socket, 
making them awkward and heavy to handle. On the other 
hand, the cylindrical shape necessitates a considerable 
force for inserting the plug into the socket, on 
account of the size of the friction surface therebetween. 
Further, these surfaces will be quickly soiled 
and become dirty, which adds to the force required. 
Also locking the parts of the extension plug-in unit 
together is relatively difficult with such cylindrical 
sockets and plugs. Often sleeve-like parts applying 
threaded couplings or the like must be used to perform  
 
the locking; the parts are adapted to slide and turn 
about the cylindrical body of the plug and socket but 
are not slidable in the axial direction beyond their 
free ends. Also, such axially elongated extension plug-in 
units cannot be accommodated in a small space and 
can utilize only very reduced bending radiuses. A 
further problem with such axially connectable sockets 
and plugs is that reliable coupling of the contacts in 
a specific order is relatively difficult to achieve 
without further increasing the length of the socket and 
the plug. Neither are the conventional extension plug-in 
unit plugs or sockets suitable for branching a cable 
but can only be employed for cable extension.  
 An extension plug-in unit according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-5
