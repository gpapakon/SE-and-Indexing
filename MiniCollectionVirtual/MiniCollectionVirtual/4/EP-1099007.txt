<ABSTRACT>
A susceptor (40) for supporting wafers (W) in a reaction chamber of a barrel reactor during a chemical vapor deposition process. The susceptor includes a body sized and shaped for receipt within the reaction chamber of the barrel reactor. The body includes a generally laterally facing, sloped face (44) having a plurality of circular recesses (46a-46c) therein for receiving wafers to support the wafers with one surface directed generally laterally outward for exposure to reactant gas inside the reaction chamber of the barrel reactor during the chemical vapor deposition process. Each of the plurality of recesses has a substantially planar bottom (50) and opposing arcuate wall portions (52a, 52b) on opposite sides of the planar bottom. Each wall portion intersects and merges with a corresponding wall portion of at least one adjoining recess of the plurality of recesses at an intersection (56). The wall portions at the intersections have a smooth shape which is continuous and uninterrupted with respect to at least one adjoining wall portion thereby inhibiting epitaxial deposition between the wafers and the susceptor at the intersections and reducing wafer chipping when the wafers are removed from the recessses following the chemical vapor deposition process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to chemical
vapor deposition of material on semiconductor wafers, and
more particularly to an improved susceptor for supporting
wafers in a reaction chamber of a barrel reactor during a
chemical vapor deposition process.Chemical vapor deposition is a process for
growing a thin layer of material on a semiconductor wafer
so its lattice structure is identical to that of the wafer.Using this process, a layer having different conductivity
may be applied to a semiconductor wafer to achieve desired
electrical properties. Generally, chemical vapor
deposition is accomplished by introducing a reactant gas
comprising the deposition material (e.g., silicon) and a
carrier gas into a reaction chamber of a barrel reactor
containing wafers.The wafers are held in the reaction chamber on a
susceptor so one face of the wafer is exposed to the
reactant gas. The susceptor is suspended inside the
reaction chamber and slowly rotates to evenly distribute
the reactant gas over the wafers. Although other shapes
are used, susceptors are generally prismatic and have
several (e.g., five) planar faces.
Examples of such susceptors are illustrated in Figures 2B, 2C, 2D, 3,
4A, 5 and 8 of United States Patent Specification No. 4,823,736.
A face of a
conventional susceptor is shown in Fig. 1 and is designated
by the reference numeral 10. Circular recesses 12 are
formed in the face 10 for holding wafers W in a generally
vertical orientation (i.e., so they face generally
laterally outward). Conventional susceptors are slightly
tapered so their tops are smaller than their bottoms. This
tapered configuration allows the wafers to lean inward into 
the recesses so gravity holds the wafers generally upright
against the susceptor. The recesses have a slightly larger
diameter than the diameter of the wafers to provide
clearance for grasping the wafers when removing them from
the recesses. For instance, a susceptor for processing 150
mm diameter wafers may have recesses which are
approximately 160 mm in diameter. Two rectangular
depressions 16 near the top of each recess 12 provide
addition as clearance for grasping the wafers. In order to
reduce the height of the susceptors, the recesses overlap
as shown in Fig. 1.Reactant gas not only deposits on the wafers but
also on many interior features of the reaction chamber, and
it preferentially deposits on nucleation sites such as
particles and sharp edges in the chamber. Due to the
overlapped configuration of the recesses, sharp corners 14
are formed on the susceptor
