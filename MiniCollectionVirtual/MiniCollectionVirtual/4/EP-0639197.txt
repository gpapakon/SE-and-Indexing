<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to one of the eight isomers of 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic 
acid, a compound 
which is an excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmitter receptor 
antagonist useful as an anticonvulsant, analgesic, cognition enhancer, and 
neuroprotectant. When compared to the remaining seven ACPA isomers, 
the invented isomer is unexpectedly more potent in invitro receptor 
binding assays and in invivo efficacy studies. The compound 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic 
acid (ACPA) was described as an excitatory amino 
acid receptor antagonist in United States Patent No. 4,761,405 which 
issued on August 2, 1988. ACPA is a compound that has three asymmetric 
carbon atoms and thus eight stereoisomers. In U.S. Patent No. 4,761,405 
ACPA is reported as a racemic mixture of the eight isomers, and the invitro 
and invivo data presented to show efficacy as an excitatory amino 
acid receptor antagonist was generated by testing the racemic mixture. 
This patent does not include data showing relative activities of any of the 
eight isomers.  
 The presently invented compound that is active as an excitatory 
amino acid receptor antagonist is the 2R, 4R, 5S isomer of ACPA that is 
substantially free from the other ACPA isomers. Substantially free is 
defined to mean at least about 95% pure. The starting material for preparation of the novel compound of the 
invention is 1R, 2S- Methyl (hydrogen)-1,2-cis-cyclohex-4-ene 
diacetate 2. This compound is prepared from the known meso diester via 
enantioselective enzymatic hydrolysis utilizing the enzyme porcine 
pancreas lipase. Y. Nago, etal., J.Org.Chem. (1985), 50, 4072. The 
use of this enzyme to obtain the chiral product 2 is known in the 
literature. Y. Nago, etal., Chem.Lett. (1989) 239. 
The preparation of the compound of the invention starting from the 
known compound 2 is summarized in Scheme I.  
 
After reduction of the double bond in 2 with hydrogen in the 
presence of a palladium catalyst, diborane is used to selectively reduce 
the carboxylic acid group to the corresponding hydroxyethyl side chain 
(Compound II). The alcohol is converted to its tert-butyldimethylsilyl 
ether III, and the ester moiety is reduced to the corresponding aldehyde 
using disobutylaluminum hydride. Aldehyde IV is then converted to 
hydantoin V by reaction with sodium cyanide and ammonium carbonate;  
 
the silyl group is removed from the oxygen during this process. The 
alcohol is converted first to methanesulfonyl derivative VI by
