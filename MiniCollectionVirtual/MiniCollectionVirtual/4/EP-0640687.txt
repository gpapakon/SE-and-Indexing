<ABSTRACT>
Methods of using, storing and transporting a 
metal protease enzyme in stabilized form in which an 

N-protected amino acid is present in or added to an 
aqueous solution or a slurry containing the protease, and 

metal protease compositions stabilized by the presence of 
N-protected amino acid. 
Effect:
 

   deactivation of metal protease is inhibited and 
the heat stability and storage stability of the enzyme are 

especially noticeably improved. Due to addition of an 
N-protected amino acid such as an N-benzyloxycarbonylamino 

acid to a metal protease, the enzyme may be stabilized 
even in the absence of excess Ca ion.

 
Accordingly, storage of metal protease for a long period 

of time has become possible and transportation and storage 
of a liquid enzyme has become easy by the present 

invention. 
The recovery of metal protease is improved by 
the presence of NPAA when a said enzyme is used in a 

coupling reaction between N-protected amino acid and amino 
acid ester. 
This effect is most notably when 
N-benzyloxycarbonylaspartic acid is used as 

N-benzyloxycarbonylamino acid and phenylalanine methyl 
ester is used as amino acid ester in aspartame production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of using, storing and transporting
a metal protease enzyme in stabilized form and, more precisely, to methods of using, storing
and transporting such enzyme in an aqueous solution containing the enzyme. The present
invention also relates to stabilized enzyme compositions.Proteases are utilized in various fields of food industry and detergents.
Where a protease is used in an aqueous solution or a slurry, it is known that it loses its
activity due to spontaneous autolysis or denaturation (pH, temperature, etc.).Recently, a method of synthesizing a dipeptide sweetener aspartame has
been developed, using a condensation reaction catalyzed by (neutral) metal proteases such
as "thermolysin" (produced by Daiwa Chemical Co.) (K. Oyama, Bioindustry, Vol. 2, No. 9,
pp. 5 to 11, 1985). This aspartame synthesis process is in part based on earlier studies of
said author (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., Vol.2, 1981, pp 356-360) regarding kinetic
parameters of the thermolysin-catalyzed reaction of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-aspartic add
(Z-L-Asp) with L-phenylalanine methyl ester (L-PM). In those studies aqueous preparations
of Z-L-Asp and L-PM, were incubated with a separately prepared stock solution of
thermolysin in water, and the time course of the reaction was studied. In the incubation
experiments the molar ratio of L-PM to Z-L-Asp was 2:1, and the initial molar concentration
of Z-L-Asp was about 3750 times that of thermolysin. Stabilization of thermolysin, however,
was not an issue in these studies, nor could any conclusions on thermolysin stabilization
been drawn therefrom. Thus, proteases, particularly metal proteases, have become
important as synthetases for peptides in the industrial field. However, these enzymes are not
stable, when the enzyme is used or stored in an aqueous solution or slurry for a long period
of time.It is noticed that is known that the stability of thermolysin can be improved
by immobilizing the enzyme, which is then preferably being used in an organic medium
(ethyl acetate). For instance, Yang et al. (Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol.32, No.5,
1988, pp 595-603) report some kinetic data on thermolysin-catalyzed synthesis of an
aspartame precursor by reaction of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-aspartic acid (Z-Asp) with excess
of L-phenylalanine methyl ester (L-PM) in ethyl acetate, which may be water-saturated. In 
particular, Yang et al. teach the use of immobilized thermolysin, preferably by entrapment of
the thermolysin in a hydrophobic cross-linked
