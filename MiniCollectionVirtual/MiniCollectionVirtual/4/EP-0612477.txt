<ABSTRACT>
A flour and water dough including a dough-improving agent 
is cut into pieces and left to rise for at least 90 

minutes. 
Subsequently the individual pieces are frozen in an 
environment at -40°C and then preserved at -20°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a frozen 
bread dough which has an improved shelf life under frozen 
storage and is thus very suitable for commercial 
distribution. More particularly this invention relates to a method for 
the production of frozen bread doughs that are cut and 
shaped to preferred dimensions and forms which are 
leavened before freezing. It is well known that a wide variety of frozen bread 
doughs is available on the market in an equally wide 
variety of shapes to satisfy the numerous requirements of 
consumers in this field. It is equally well known that the greatest problem 
existing in the production and subsequent 
commercialisation (distribution and sale) of frozen bread 
doughs is that of their frozen storage shelf life which 
varies according to the composition of the dough, the 
dimensions and shapes of the "bread" made therefrom and, 
not least, the technique used for the freezing. In order to increase the frozen storage shelf life of  
 
bread doughs, numerous techniques have been suggested and 
put into practice. One method very widely used provides 
for the preparation and freezing of a bread dough which 
has not been allowed to rise, or leaven at all, or has 
been subject to only slight leavening, so that the yeast 
incorporated in the dough retains sufficient vitality and 
a good capacity to form gas (CO₂). Other methods provide for the partial leavening of the 
dough before freezing; yet others rely on suitable 
modifications to conventional dough mixes; for example 
the use of particular flours with very high protein 
contents (higher than 16-18%) has been taught or, again, 
the use of critical quantities of particular yeasts 
and/or conditioning additives in the dough or agents 
which inhibit the activity of the yeast during storage of 
the dough in the frozen state. It is, however, generally and unfortunately recognised 
that the bread products obtained from doughs frozen by 
the methods used up till now have a frozen storage shelf 
life which is wholly insufficient even when the doughs 
are cooled to -29°C-30°C, of such doughs thus being 
unsuitable and unsatisfactory for commercial use 
(distribution and sale). The problem at the root of the present invention is that  
 
of providing a method for the industrial production of 
frozen bread doughs which, in all the various shapes and 
weights in which they may be used, have extremely good 
stability during frozen storage even over prolonged 
periods, and considerably better than those usually 
consumed for

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of frozen bread dough 
characterised in that it comprises the successive steps 

of: 

forming a flour and water dough incorporating 
yeast, salt and a dough-improving agent selected from the 

group comprising dextrose, acetyltartaric esters of the 
monodiglycerides of the fatty acids, monodiglycerides of 

the fatty acids, ascorbic acid and their mixtures, 
after a resting period of 10/15 minutes at 20⁰C-25⁰C, 
cutting the dough into small pieces so as to obtain 

individual pieces of predetermined weight which are 
subsequently shaped, 
leavening the individual pieces thus obtained for 
at least 90 minutes in an environment with a temperature 

of about 30⁰C-32⁰C and a relative humidity of 80%-85%, 
fast-freezing the individual leavened pieces in an 
environment at -40⁰C over a period of between 15 and 45 

minutes until the centre of the individual pieces have 
reached a temperature of between 0⁰C and -4⁰C, and 
storing the individual frozen pieces at -20⁰C. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the dough-improving agent is constituted by a mixture of 

monodiglycerides and/or their esters, ascorbic acid and 
 

dextrose. 
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the dough-improving agent is used in quantities of from 

2% to 5% by weight of the weight of the flour used. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the dough is formed by initial slow kneading at about 80 

beats per minute and subsequent fast kneading at about 
150 beats per minute for a longer period of time than the 

slow kneading. 
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the individual frozen pieces are packaged in plastics 

wrappers for preservation at -20⁰C. 
A pre-leavened frozen bread dough obtained by the 
method of the preceding claims.
