<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection molding 
method of a polypropylene resin composition and also to 
a molded product obtained by the method and having excellent 
transparency and surface gloss. In general, isotactic polypropylene is economical 
and excellent in mechanical properties, heat 
resistance, hygienic suitability and water-vapor-permeation 
resistance and when molded, provides good 
external appearance, so that it has been used widely 
for various applications. Recently, it was found by J.A. Ewen et al. that 
polypropylene having such high tacticity as exceeding 
0.7 in terms of syndiotactic pentad fraction can be obtained 
using a catalyst composed of aluminoxane and a 
transition metal compound having an asymmetric ligand 
(J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 110, 6255-6, 1988). Compared  
 
with conventional isotactic polypropylene, this 
syndiotactic polypropylene is extremely high in transparency 
and surface gloss and is also excellent in 
flexibility. The syndiotactic polypropylene is hence 
expected to develop new application fields to which the 
conventional isotactic polypropylene cannot be applied. 
It, however, has not been produced yet on an industrial 
scale because of some problems unsolved in processability 
or the like. Isotactic polypropylene has been used in a variety 
of fields owing to its excellent properties. Various types of isotactic polypropylenes are now 
in use. Among these, crystalline isotactic propylene-ethylene 
random copolymer has been used as packing 
materials and the like because it has relatively good 
transparency and surface gloss. Its transparency and 
surface gloss, however, are not considered sufficient, 
leading to a desire for further improvements. To obtain a molded product having excellent 
transparency by injection molding of isotactic 
polypropylene, it is preferred to cool down the molten 
resin as quickly as possible after it is charged into a 
mold. Injection molding at a low mold temperature, 
however, results in a molded product with a defect in 
shape or external appearance such as a warp, so that an  
 
intended molded product cannot be obtained. Accordingly, 
it is the common practice to obtain a molded product 
free of a defect in shape or external appearance 
such as a warp by conducting injection molding with 
heating the mold to about 50-60°C at the sacrifice of 
its transparency to some extent. Syndiotactic polypropylene, on the other hand, is 
accompanied with the drawback that owing to its lower 
crystallization rate and crystallinity
