<ABSTRACT>
A digital video tape recorder (3), which operates to receive an advanced 
television (ATV) signal to be recorded, provides a portion such as a low-band 

coefficient of an intra-coded frame of the ATV signal as variable-speed data, and 
records the digital video data and the variable-speed data in a main area (A1) and a 

marginal area (A2), respectively, of successive tracks on a record medium in which 
the marginal area is located on each track at a position which is reproducible in a 

fast-speed reproducing mode. The digital video tape recorder reproduces the recorded 
data in the fast-speed reproducing mode by reproducing the portion of the signal 

stored from the marginal area of each track which is located at specific reproducible 
areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recording and reproducing digital video data.Existing analog video recorders record analog video signals on a magnetic
medium generally in non-compressed form since their bandwidths are quite narrow.
In addition to recording and reproducing video signals, current analog video recorders
are operable to reproduce the stored video signals in a high-speed search mode,
whereat the magnetic tape medium is transported at a greater speed than the speed at
which the tape is transported during normal reproduction. Since positions on each
recording track on the magnetic tape medium correspond to positions in a video
image, partial scannings of a multiple number of tracks produce sufficient information
to produce a recognizable, albeit, poor image.Digital video recorders, such as digital VTRs, have been developed for
recording a video signal in digitized form on a magnetic medium. However, since the
bandwidth of a digital video signal is quite wide, it is difficult to record a digital video
signal directly on a video tape. Hence, techniques have 
been proposed for encoding the digital video signal in a manner
which reduces its bandwidth. So-called compression encoding
techniques include the orthogonal transformation and variable
length encoding of the digital video signal; and one highly
efficient encoding technique utilizes discrete cosine
transformation, or DCT. Compression encoding is further
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,321,440 and 5,346,310.Digital VTRs which utilize compression encoding
techniques to reduce the bandwidth of television signals, e,g.,
NTSC signals or HDTV signals, prior to recording also decompress
or decode reproduced signals so as to return the compressed
television signals to their original non-compressed form. One
efficient compression technique is to combine the above-mentioned
DCT with motion compensation, which utilizes both intraframe
coding and interframe coding of the video signal. However, and
in contrast to high-speed reproduction of analog signals by an
analog video recorder, digital VTRs may not simply scan the
tracks on a magnetic tape while transporting it at a greater
speed to produce high-speed reproduced images since DCT and
interframe decompression techniques require a substantial part,
if not all of the data on each track to be reproduced in order to
produce stable video images. For example, positions of discrete
cosine transformed digital video data do not coincide with 
positions in a video image, and thus, scanning a different
portion of a
