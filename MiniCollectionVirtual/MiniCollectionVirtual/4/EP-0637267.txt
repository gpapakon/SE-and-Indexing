<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
disposal of construction and demolition debris
for
landfills.Environmental regulations
require the operators of sanitary landfill operations to
periodically cover disposed solid waste with six inches
of earthen material to control disease, insects, fires,
odors, blowing litter, and scavenging For example,
most jurisdictions require such covering of sanitary
landfills at the end of each operating day, or at more
frequent intervals if necessary. This covering
requirement and the cover material is known as "daily
cover" or "periodic cover" where the regulatory interval
is more than one day, e.g., three days. As used herein,
"daily cover" is intended to include daily and periodic
cover for sanitary landfills, such as municipal solid
waste (MSW) landfills, rubble landfills, land clearing
debris landfills, and industrial waste landfills.Each day's garbage, trash or rubble layer is
covered at the end of the day and further garbage, trash
or rubble layers are then spread directly on top of the
daily cover from the previous day. In many landfill 
sites the soil used for the daily cover must be mined at
the landfill site or purchased from an outside source
and, due to the high rate of soil consumption, comprises
a substantial cost item. Moreover, it has been
recognized that multiple earth fill layers used in this
way consume a significant volume of the valuable
landfill space which might otherwise be used for
receiving garbage, trash or rubble. It is well known
that many communities are rapidly exhausting their
available landfill acreage and it is therefore desirable
to reduce the consumption rate of the available landfill
volume. Accordingly, federal and state regulations
allow alternative, more compressible, daily cover
materials in lieu of the six inches of earthen material
so long as the alternative materials provide the
requisite level of protection.Several such alternative daily cover materials
are known in the art. One alternative, disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,519,338 to Kramer et al, comprises
hardenable plastic foam cover which is applied to the
waste material by spraying. Similarly, companies such
as 3M Environmental Protection Products of St. Paul,
Minn., Chubb Environmental Security of Exton, PA., and
Russmer of Westchester, PA., have all developed
synthetic foams which can be sprayed onto a landfill
face each day to function as a daily cover.One disadvantage of such foam spray daily
covers is that the high pressure spray equipment
utilized to apply the

A method of making daily cover for a landfill comprising
the steps of: providing a supply of construction and

demolition debris; adding water to said debris; and processing
said debris through a shredder so as to produce a

moist shredded product having an average particle size and
a moisture content sufficient to permit use of said product

as daily cover for a landfill.
The method of claim 1, including the step of applying
said product to a landfill as daily cover.
The method of claim 1, wherein said average particle
size is less than about 160 mm (six inches) and said moisture

content is about 5% to 30% by weight.
The method of claim 1, wherein said average particle
size is less than about 80 mm (three inches) and said

moisture content is about 10% to 14% by weight.
The method of claim 1, wherein the water is added
after processing said debris through said shredder.
The method of claim 1, including the step of compacting
said debris prior to processing said debris through

said shredder.
The method of claim 1, including the step of separating
ferrous metal from said debris after processing said

debris through said shredder. 
The method of claim 1, including the step of separating
non-ferrous metal from said debris after processing

said debris through said shredder.
The method of claim 1, including the step of adding
ferrous metal items to said debris prior to processing said

debris through said shredder.
A method of disposing of waste material in a landfill
wherein construction and demolition debris processed

in accordance with claim 1 is used as daily cover for a
landfill.
A method of disposing of waste material in a landfill
comprising the steps of: dumping a first layer of

waste material on a landfill site; applying a first daily
cover layer of wet shredded construction and demolition

debris processed in accordance with claim 1 over said first
layer of waste material; dumping a second layer of waste

material over said first daily cover layer; and applying a
second daily cover layer of wet shredded construction and

demolition debris processed in accordance with claim 1 over
said second layer of waste material.
A method of disposing of municipal solid waste and
construction and demolition debris in a landfill comprising

the steps of: dumping a first layer of shredded municipal
solid waste on a landfill site; and applying a second daily

cover layer over said first layer, said second layer comprising
construction and demolition debris to which water

is added during processing of the debris through a shredder
into a moist shredded product.
