<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process recorder housing in which the components of a process recorder are arranged. The housing can be closed by means of a door at the front, and a seal is provided in a sealing groove between the housing and the door at the front. In order to increase the statical stability of the housing, it is proposed according to the invention that the housing (1) be of self-supporting design, and that a reinforcing frame is inserted in the sealing groove (7) in the region of the door at the front of the housing, and that the seal (3) is releasably connected to the reinforcing frame (5).
