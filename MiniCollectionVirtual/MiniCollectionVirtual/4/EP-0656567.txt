<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic
photosensitive member comprising a
photosensitive layer containing a disazo pigment having a
specific structure, and to a process cartridge and an
electrophotographic apparatus having the electrophotographic
photosensitive member.Electrophotographic photosensitive members having an
organic photoconductive materials have advantages in that
their productivity is satisfactory, their cost can be reduced
relatively and their color sensitivity can desirably be
controlled by adequately selecting the pigment or dye used.
Therefore, various studies of such electrophotographic
photosensitive members has been carried out. In particular, a 
function-separated-type photosensitive member has been
developed by which poor sensitivity and unsatisfactory
durability that have been experienced with the conventional
organic electrophotographic photosensitive member can be
overcome. The foregoing function-separated-type
photosensitive member has a charge generating layer which
contains charge generating materials, such as an organic
photoconductive pigment and dye, and a charge transporting
layer which contains charge transporting materials, such as
photoconductive polymers and low-molecular weight organic
photoconductive materials.The azo pigments have, among the organic photoconductive
materials, excellent photoconductivity and various kinds of
them can be relatively easily obtained by combining amine
components and coupler components. Therefore, various
pigments have been disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 56-116040 corresponding to EP-A-34497, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-231052,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-267363, and Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 63-264762.In recent years, however, there have been demands for
higher image quality and more excellent durability. To meet
these demands, electrophotographic photosensitive members
having higher sensitivity, more excellent electrophotographic
characteristics, even when repeatedly used and having
excellent environment stability have been desired. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member having
excellent sensitivity.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
electrophotographic photosensitive member having stable and
excellent potential characteristics even after repeated use or
use in a variety of environments.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
process cartridge and an electrophotographic
