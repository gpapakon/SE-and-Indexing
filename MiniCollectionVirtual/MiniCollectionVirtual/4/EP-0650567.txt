<ABSTRACT>
Motion transmitting rod (16), particularly for a gear box, comprising on a portion of its length an elastic filtering sleeve (11) engaged by its ends into two tubular extremities (17) of the rod (16) which are then connected to each other, said sleeve being comprised of a rectangular cross-section bar (12) coated with an elastic coating (13). Said rod is characterized in that the bar (12) has at the union between said tubular extremities (17) of the rod at least one widening portion (18) which is also coated with said elastic coating (13) and which is engaged into two notches (19) with shapes complementary of that of the widening portion (18) and provided at the end in said extremities (17).

<CLAIMS>
Motion transmission rod (6), especially for operating 
a gearbox, this rod being cut transversely and so 

defining two ends (17), which are connected to each other by 
an elastic filtering sleeve (11), characterized in that said 

sleeve ends (17) are tubular and in that said sleeve (11) 
comprises a flat bar (12) wrapped with an elastic coating 

(13), this bar (12) presenting, at the point of the junction 
between said tubular ends (17) of the rod, two widened parts 

(18) also wrapped (17) with said elastic coating (13) and 
engaged in two pairs of notches (19), these notches having 

a shape respectively complementary to those of these widened 
parts (18) and adapted to prevent any relative axial 

rotation between the two tubular ends (17). 
Rod according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said elastic coating (13) of the sleeve (11) has a peripheral 

bead (20) inserted between said tubular extremities (17) 
of the rod. 
Rod according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said tubular extremities (17) of the rod are flattened 

in order to produce the clamping of said sleeve (11), this 
flattening being in the same direction as that of said bar 

(12). 
Rod according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said notches (19) are cut at the end 

of said extremities (17). 
Rod according to claims 3 and 4, characterized in 
that two flattened lengths of reinforcing tube (21) are 

clamped onto said flattened tubular extremities (17) of the 
rod, these lengths including, at the end, in their facing 

extremities, notches (22) similar to those which are made in 
the end face of the tubular extremities (17) of the rod, so 

as to receive the extremities of said widened parts (18). 
Rod according anyone of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it includes pins (23) for guarding 

against pulling apart, passing both through said tubular  
 

extremities and through the bar (12) without creating a 
rigid bridge between them.
