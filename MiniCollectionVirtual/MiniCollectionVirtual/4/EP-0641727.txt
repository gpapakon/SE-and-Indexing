<ABSTRACT>
A spray dispensing package comprising: an outer 
shell (10, 12); and a refill cartridge (16, 18) that fits 

within the outer shell. The refill cartridge includes a 
spray container (18) which has a body (60) and a spray 

valve which includes a valve stem (62). The refill 
cartridge has a base (20), and a spray nozzle (70), and 

the spray nozzle is fitted over the spray container in 
fluid communication with the valve stem. The spray 

nozzle is also attached to the can body with a sufficient 
range of motion to allow the spray valve to be actuated 

when pressure is applied to the top surface (38) of the 
shell. The shell has a top surface and an opening (40) 

in the top surface to receive the spray nozzle such that 
a spray can exit the spray nozzle to the atmosphere and 

such that the shell is supported by the refill cartridge. 
The shell also has guide surfaces (14, 42 
&
 142) which 
cooperate with the refill cartridge to allow the shell to 

slide smoothly relative to the refill cartridge when 
pressure is applied to the top surface of the shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spray dispenser package and refill package therefor.
Such dispensers typically are used to dispense or spray perfume and other
compositions into the atmosphere to freshen the air.In the past air freshening devices have been
characterized either as instant action aerosol sprays or
continuous action products such as various gels which
contain perfume and which last for 20-60 days. While
those instant action sprays and continuous action gels
are effective, there are times when both an instant
action and continuous action are needed at similar times.
Prior devices and compositions have been unable to
provide an instant action air freshener with a long
lasting effect.PCT published Application No. WO92/04419 discloses
aerosol compositions packaged within a metering valve
aerosol having a high level of perfume. Formulations as
described in this patent can be used in the device of the
present invention.US-A-4,849,606 describes an electric warming
unit into which the cartridges containing a gel air
freshener are inserted, the gel having a film coating
through which the perfume permeates to freshen the air.US-A-3,272,391 and 3,272,392 disclose aerosol
container dispensers which are activated by side finger
pressure.US-A-3,347,423 discloses an aerosol container
that is completely enclosed within a shroud. U.S. Patent
3,128,916 discloses an aerosol spray which can
incorporate refills. US-A-4,277,004 discloses an aerosol spray container with a cover which
simultaneously acts as an actuator. The cover comprises an outer shell with a
top surface having an opening which aligns with the spray nozzle of the can
such that spray connects it to the spray nozzle through the orifice. The top
surface of the cover has flexing means enabling its center portion to be
pressed down thereby actuating the valve on the can. This center portion has
a depending cylindrical wall which has abutments which engage
complementary abutments on the can itself in the depressed state of the
valve, thereby ensuring that once the valve is pressed it remains depressed
until the entire contents of the aerosol can have been discharged.None of the above patents disclose a dispensing container of the type
described in this application.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a spray
dispensing package comprising: a refill cartridge consisting of a spray
container having a can body and a spray valve which includes a spray valve
stem with a spray nozzle fitted over the spray container in fluid
communication
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A spray dispenser package comprising:

a refill cartridge comprising a spray container (18) having a can body
(60,) and a spray valve which includes a spray valve stem (62), with a spray

nozzle (28) fitted over the spray container (18) in fluid communication with
the valve stem (62);

wherein
the refill cartridge further comprises a refill shroud (16) having a base
(20), a shroud wall (22) and flexing means (30, 32) by which the spray nozzle (28) is attached to the

shroud wall (22); and
the spray dispensing package also has an outer shell (10, 12), within
which the refill cartridge is fitted; and
the shell has a top surface (38) and an opening (40) therein to receive
the spray nozzle (28) such that a spray can exit the spray nozzle (28) through

spray nozzle orifice (70) to the atmosphere and such that the shell (10, 12), is
supported by the refill shroud (16); and
the flexing means (30, 32) has a sufficient range of motion to allow the
spray valve to be actuated when pressure is applied to the top surface (38) of

the shell; and
the shell (10, 12) further has guide means (14, 42, 142) which cooperate
with the refill cartridge to allow the shell (10, 12) to slide smoothly relative to
