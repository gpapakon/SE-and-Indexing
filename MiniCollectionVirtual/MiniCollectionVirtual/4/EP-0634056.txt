<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a method for determining the hole or electron concentration, transition temperature, ratio Tc/Tc(max), or state of doping of a material capable of exhibiting superconductivity when cooled below its critical temperature, by measuring the thermopower of a sample of the material above the critical temperature of the material and determining from the thermopower the hole or electron concentration, transition temperature, ratio Tc/Tc(max), or state of doping of the material as to whether it is underdoped, overdoped or optimally doped. The sample may be differentially heated and/or cooled to generate a temperature difference across the sample, the temperature difference across the sample measured, the voltage across the sample measured, and the hole concentration or similar determined from the measured temperature difference and the measured voltage. Means for determining the hole concentration, transition temperature, or doping of the material is also claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention comprises a method and means for
determining the doped or chemical hole concentration in high-Tc
superconducting cuprates and related compounds.The high-Tc superconducting cuprates all have in common
square-planar sheets of CuO2 with Cu occupying the B-site of a
perovskite unit and O atoms in the perovskite anion sites linking
the corner-shared Cu atoms. These CuO2 planes are the essential
structural ingredient for superconductivity in these cuprate
perovskites and superconductivity arises when holes or electrons
are doped into the planes to a concentration exceeding a minimum
(pmin for holes, nmin for electrons) and less than a maximum (pmax
and nmax respectively). Without loss of generality, the bounds are
established as pmin ≈ 0.05 holes/Cu and pmax ≈ 0.27 holes/Cu for the
hole-type superconductors (see Presland et al, Physica C176
(1991) 95-105), but are not yet clearly determined for the
electron superconductors. In this specification the invention is
described with reference to the hole-superconductors but
qualitatively similar, although numerically different bounds are
believed to apply for the electron superconductors and the
invention and general principles disclosed herein also have
application to the electron superconductors as will be apparent.Fig. 1 shows this general superconducting phase
behaviour for the hole-doped superconductors. Superconductivity 
occurs for about 0.05 ≤ p ≤ 0.27 and Tc rises to a maximum Tc(max)
at p ∼ 0.16 following an approximately parabolic dependence on p,
conveniently and without loss of generality, given by
Tc/Tc(max) ≈ 1-82.6 (p-0.16)2For about p<0.05 the behaviour is semiconducting and
insulating as T→0 while for about p>0.27 normal metallic behaviour
occurs. The parabolic curve in Fig. 1 was fitted to the data
reported by Torrance et al, Phys. Rev.B40 (1989) 8872 and Takagi
et al, Phys. Rev.B40 (1989) 2254, but it is likely that all other
superconducting cuprates follow a similar curve. The domain
p < 0.16 is referred to as underdoped and p > 0.16 as overdoped.
Because of this common phase behaviour which is general to the
superconducting cuprates, the chemical hole concentration is an
important parameter whose determination makes it possible to
locate a compound on the superconducting phase diagram, and
moreover indicates whether, and by how much, the doping need be
altered to maximise Tc at Tc(max). Alternatively doping may be
altered to maximise the critical current of the superconductor.
To maximise critical current the material is
