<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for operating a discharge lamp in the 
present invention can easily set the lighting efficiency 

of each of all discharge lamps at a given value by 
decreasing the crest factors of the discharge lamps to a 

given level or lower, and narrowing the variance between 
the crest factors. Pulse current output from the diode 

circuit (16) is supplied to the inverter circuit (20) 
via the partial smoothing circuit (18), where the 

current is converted into a high-frequency current. The 
high-frequency is further changed to a high voltage by 

the resonance circuit (20), and the high voltage is 
supplied to the discharge lamps (26₁, 26₂) via choke 

coils (L0₁, L0₂) to light the lamps. The discharge 
lamps (26₁, 26₂) are connected in common to the 

resonance circuit (22) only, and therefore the crest 
factors of the lamps can be commonly adjusted by the 

value of each of the coil (L12) and capacitor (C15) of 
the resonance circuit (22). Thus, the variance of the 

crest factors of the discharge lamps can be narrowed, 

and the crest factors can be easily decreased to a given 
level or lower.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
operating a plurality of discharge lamps, and more specifically to the 
improvement of the crest factor of such lamps. In a conventional apparatus for operating a 
discharge lamp, power from a commercial electrical 
outlet is converted once into a DC current, and then 
into a high-frequency current by an inverter, and the 
high-frequency current is applied to the discharge lamp 
such as a fluorescent lamp, thereby lighting the 
discharge lamp. FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a conventional 
example of such a discharge lamp. An alternating 
current supplied from a power tap 2 is rectified by a 
diode bridge circuit 4, and then input to an inverter 
circuit 8 via a partial smoothing circuit 6 (trough portions 
of a waveform are filled) to be converted into a 
high-frequency current. The high-frequency current output 
from the inverter circuit 8 is further converted 
into a high voltage by a set of two resonance circuits 
consisting of a capacitor C0, and two coils L0 connected 
in parallel. The high voltage is supplied to discharge 
lamps 101 and 102 to light them up. In this figure, 
only two discharge lamps, that is, 101 and 102, are 
shown, but when three or more lamps are connected, they 
are connected in parallel as in the case of the lamps 
101 and 102, and the redundant explanation thereof will  
 
be omitted. The partial smoothing circuit 6 has the structure 
in which a capacitor C1 is connected in parallel to the 
serial circuit consisting of a diode D1, a coil L1 and a 
capacitor C2, and a cathode of a diode D2 is connected 
to the connecting point between the coil L1 and the 
diode D1. With this structure, the capacitor C2 is 
charged via the diode D2 while a current is supplied 
from the diode bridge 4 to the inverter circuit 8. When 
a current supplied from the diode bridge circuit 4 
decreases, the charge stored in the capacitor C2 is 
supplied to the inverter circuit 8 via the coil L1 and 
the diode D1. Thus, the trough portions (reduced portions) 
of the current flowing to the inverter circuit 8 
is filled. The inverter circuit 8 is a serial circuit consisting 
of direct field effect transistors (FET) Q1 and 
Q2. When the FETs Q1 and Q2 are switched on by a 
control circuit (not shown), an input current is converted 
into a high-frequency current. Note that the 
capacitor C3 provided on the power outlet side is used 
for eliminating noise. In the case of a waveform of a voltage (V1) input 
to the inverter circuit 8 shown in FIG. 2A,
