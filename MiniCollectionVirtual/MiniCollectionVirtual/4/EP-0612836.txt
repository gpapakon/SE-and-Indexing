<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricant composition suitable 
for use as, or in, for example aviation turbine oils and engine oils 
for internal combustion engines. Jet engines operate under conditions which require that 
lubricants perform at high temperatures. The temperatures are such 
that natural lubricating oils are not suitable for use in jet engines. 
Current original equipment manufacturer and military specifications 
require that aviation turbine oils meet a number of stringent performance 
requirements. New jet engines place increased demands on 
aviation turbine oils, particularly with regard to their load bearing 
the properties. Many load bearing (extreme pressure) additives have 
drawbacks when used in aviation turbine oils due to the extreme 
operating conditions and stringent specifications which such oils must 
meet. In order to protect internal combustion engines from wear, 
engine lubricating oils have been provided with antiwear and anti-oxidant 
additives. The primary oil additive for the past 40 years for 
providing antiwear and antioxidant properties has been zinc dialkyldithiophosphate 
(ZDDP). Oil formulations containing ZDDP, however, 
require friction modifiers in order to reduce energy losses in overcoming 
friction. Such energy losses result in lower fuel economy. 
Moreover, oil additive packages containing ZDDP have environmental 
drawbacks. ZDDP adds to engine deposits which can lead to increased 
oil consumption and emissions. Moreover, ZDDP is not ash-free. 
Various ashless oil additive packages have been developed recently due 
to such environmental concerns. It would be desirable to have a multifunctional lubricating 
oil additive which provides extreme pressure capabilities in aviation 
turbine oils which meets jet engine specifications as well as provide  
 
friction modifying and antiwear properties in lubricating oils for 
internal combustion engines. This invention relates to a lubricating oil composition which 
comprises (a) a major amount of a lubricating oil basestock and (b) a 
minor amount of trithiocyanuric acid. Another embodiment of the 
invention relates to a lubricating oil composition for jet engines 
which comprises (a) a major amount of an aviation turbine oil, and (b) 
a minor amount of trithiocyanuric acid. Yet another embodiment of the 
invention relates to a lubricating oil composition for use in internal 
combustion engines which comprises (a) a major amount of a lubricating 
oil basestock and (b) a minor amount of trithiocyanuric acid. Other
