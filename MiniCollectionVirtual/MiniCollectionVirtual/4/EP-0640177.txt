<CLAIMS>
Suction pipe with a number of individual suction 
pipes and a manifold pipe, which connects the suction pipes 

at the inlet side, the manifold pipe (11) being formed 
intregrally with the suction pipes (10, 16, 17, 18) and 

being produced by the blow moulding technique, 
characterised in that a bypass resonator (21) is provided 

as an additional member, and this bypass resonator is 
situated between two adjacently disposed suction pipes (16, 

17); the manifold pipe, suction pipe and bypass resonator 
having an integral, blown form. 
Suction pipe according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the manifold pipe (11) is disposed on an air filter 

housing (43) by means of a plug-in and/or screw connection. 
Suction pipe according to claim 2, characterised in 
that a bypass resonator (36) is provided in the air filter 

housing (43), and this bypass resonator communicates with 
the manifold pipe (32) of the suction pipe via an aperture 

(42). 
Suction pipe according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a resonator (40) is disposed 

in the manifold pipe (32), the length of said resonator 
corresponding to Lamda/4. 
Suction pipe according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a connecting flange (12) is 

disposed on each of the ends of the suction pipes (10, 16, 
17, 18) close to the engine, each connecting flange being 

connected to the suction pipe by means of a plug-in 
connection or welded joint. 
Suction pipe according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the manifold pipe (11) is  

 
open on the side situated opposite the inlet side of the 

suction pipes (10, 16, 17, 18), the open side of the 
manifold pipe being sealed by a cover member. 
Method of producing a suction pipe from plastics 
material by means of the blow moulding technique, 

characterised in that the individual suction pipes (10, 16, 
17, 18) and the manifold pipe (11), which connects the 

suction pipes at the inlet side, are integrally formed, a 
bypass resonator (21) being shaped to fit on the suction 

pipe, and this bypass resonator (21) being situated between 
two suction pipes and being provided with an aperture (23), 

which terminates in the manifold pipe (11). 
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that 
an additional resonator member (40) is inserted into the 

manifold pipe (32), the length of said member being 
Lambda/4.
