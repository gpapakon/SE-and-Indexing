<ABSTRACT>
A channel (3) for a window regulator (1) including 
a main guide body (12) for supporting a slide (4) 

running along the guide body (12) and connected to and 
moving with a sliding window (2) along the channel (3); 

and a cable device for operating the slide (4); the main 
guide body (12) being fittable to a frame (23) by means 

of a pair of portions (24) integral with the body (12) 
itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a window
regulator, preferably for vehicles, as known from
FR-A-2 207 520.More specifically, the present invention relates
to a window regulator according to the preamble of independent claim 1 of the type comprising a channel
for use with a slide connected to a sliding window with which it runs
along the channel, and a slide activating device; the
activating device comprising a cable connected to the
slide and extending along at least part of a loop path;
and provision being made for an actuator assembly
connected to the cable for moving it axially along said
path, and at least one sheath portion for a
corresponding portion of the cable and extending between
fixed points of said path.The channel normally comprises a main body made of
sheet metal and bracketed to a frame normally consisting
of a portion of the vehicle door. Assembly of such
channels is therefore relatively time-consuming, due to
the additional assembly components involved.FR-A-2 207 520 discloses a window regulator
channel which comprises a main body, in turn,
comprising an elongated plate and two terminal integral
deformed portions which can be fitted to the support
frame. In particular, each terminal portion comprises a
connection plate which is face to a relative terminal
portion of the elongate plate, is spaced away from the
terminal portion itself, and presents a connection
hole.
Assembly of such window regulator channel is quite
difficult since the connection holes are disposed at
the back of the elongated plate with respect the slide.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a perfected window regulator which is  
relatively straightforward and hence cheap to produce
and assemble.According to the present invention, there is
provided a window regulator as defined in claim 1.A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention
will be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows a schematic side view of a window
regulator according to the
present invention;Figure 2 shows a side view of the channel of Figure 1 ;Figure 3 shows a larger-scale, partially sectioned
view of part of the Figure 2 channel;Figure 4 shows the same view as in Figure 3 of a
variation of the Figure 3 channel.Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a window regulator
for two-way regulation of a window 2 (shown partly by
the dotted line) of a vehicle (not shown).Device 1 comprises a vertical channel 3; and a
slide 4 connected in known and sliding manner to the
curved-section main
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A window regulator (1) for two-way regulation
of a window (2) sliding relative to a frame (23)

comprising a channel (3) having a main body (12)
supporting and guiding a slide (4) provided with means

(18) for supporting and fitting a window to said slide
(4); said main body (12) presenting at least one

integral deformed portion (24;24') for fitting the
channel (3) to a frame (23), characterized in that

said integral portion (24) consists of a portion
partially cut out of said main body (12) and bent to

stand away therefrom.
A window regulator as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that said integral portion (24) is

supported and fitted directly on to said frame (23).
A window regulator as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that said integral portion (24)

presents at least one seat (28;28') for the passage of
at least one element (25;27) for connecting it to said

frame (23).
A window regulator as claimed in Claim 3,
characterized in that said seat (28') consists in a

drawn portion of said integral portion (24) for housing
the head of said connecting element (27).
A window regulator as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that said connecting element (25; 27)

is fixed to said integral portion (24) of said main
body (12).
A window regulator as claimed in one of the
foregoing Claims, characterized in that said main body

(12) is made of sheet of metal.
A window regulator as claimed in one of the
foregoing Claims, characterized in that it comprises a

pair of said integral portions (24) for fitment to said
frame (23), located close to the ends of said body

(12).
