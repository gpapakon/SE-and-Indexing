<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process and apparatus in which vacuum extraction is used to remove 
soil contaminants (14,20-24;Fig. 1) in both the saturated and vadose zones. One embodiment 

of the present invention is directed to a process for removing contaminants from a 
contaminated area of the ground having a vadose zone and a water table (18;Fig. 1), which 

comprises providing a borehole (42) in the contaminated area (14,22;Fig. 1) to a depth below 
the water table (18); placing in the borehole (42) to a depth below the water table (18) a 

perforated riser pipe (44) inside of which is situated a vacuum extraction pipe (30) with a 
bottom opening situated within the perforated riser pipe (44), said vacuum extraction pipe (30) 

containing groundwater prior to application of a vacuum thereto, said vacuum extraction pipe 
(30) having at least one gas inlet (41) situated below the groundwater level in the vacuum 

extraction pipe (30); while introducing (31) a gas into the riser pipe (44), applying a vacuum to 
the vacuum extraction pipe (30) to draw gases and liquid from the soil into the perforated riser 

pipe (44) and from the riser pipe into the vacuum extraction pipe (30) and transport both the 
gases and the liquid to the surface as a two-phase common stream; introducing a gas into the 

vacuum extraction pipe (30) at a level below the groundwater level (18) in the vacuum 
extraction pipe (30) to initiate two-phase flow within the vacuum extraction pipe; forming 

from the common stream a stream which is primarily liquid and a stream which is primarily 
gaseous; and separately treating the separated liquid and gas streams. Also disclosed is an 

apparatus for carrying out the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a process for removing chemical 
contaminants from groundwater. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a 
process in which vacuum extraction is used to remove soil contaminants in both 
the saturated and vadose zones. Contaminants can exist in subsurface soil and groundwater in the liquid or vapor 
phase as discrete substances and mixed with and/or dissolved in groundwater and soil gases. 
Various contaminants can be found in groundwater and soil, such as volatile compounds, 
including volatile organic compounds, nonvolatile materials, metal contaminants, and the like. 
Such contaminants can be found and dealt with in the vadose (unsaturated) zone found 
between the surface of the earth and the water table, at the interface between the vadose 
zone and the water table, and in the saturated zone below the water table. At many industrial and commercial facilities and at waste handling and disposal sites, 
soil and groundwater are contaminated with suspended or water-soluble chemicals, or both. A 
variety of techniques have been used for removal of contaminants and remediation of affected 
soil. One common technique entails the excavation and off-site treatment of the soil. Another 
technique entails saturating the contaminated soil with water in situ, causing the contaminants 
to be leached slowly from the soil by the water. The contaminated water can then be removed. Techniques have also been proposed for removing volatile organic contaminants 
from soil by vacuum extraction For example, in U.S. Patent 4,323,122, it was proposed that a 
vacuum be applied in a borehole at the level of the water table, the assumption being that a 
contaminant such as gasoline, which is lighter than water, would float on the water table and 
present a layer that could be drawn off by vacuum applied to the liquid at or around that level. 
U.S. Patent 4,323,122 (Knopik) discloses a system and method for recovering organic liquid 
such as gasoline which has settled on the water table in underground areas. The system 
comprises a conduit extending from the ground surface to a point just above the water table, a 
collection head fitted on the lower end of the conduit, a collection vessel connected to the 
upper end of the conduit, and an exhaust means for creating less than atmospheric pressure in 
the vessel. The collection head has a liquid impermeable end portion and a liquid permeable 
intermediate portion for permitting the passage of liquid. The process comprises providing an

A process for removing contaminants from a contaminated area of the ground 
having a vadose zone and a water table, which comprises providing a borehole (42) in the 

contaminated area to a depth below the water table, placing in the borehole (42) to a depth below 
the water table a perforated riser pipe (44) inside of which is situated a vacuum extraction pipe (30) 

with a bottom opening situated within the perforated riser pipe (44), said vacuum extraction pipe (30) 
containing groundwater prior to application of a vacuum thereto, said vacuum extraction pipe (30) 

having at least one gas inlet (41); 
while introducing a gas into the riser pipe (44), applying a vacuum to the vacuum extraction 

pipe (30) to draw gases and liquid from the soil into the perforated riser pipe (44) and from the riser 
pipe (44) into the vacuum extraction pipe (30) and transport both the gases and the liquid to the surface 

as a two-phase common stream; introducing a gas into the vacuum extraction pipe through 
said gas inlet (41) to initiate two-phase flow within 

the vacuum extraction pipe (30); forming from the common stream a stream which is primarily 
liquid and a stream which is primarily gaseous; and separately treating the separated liquid 

and gas streams, characterized in that said gas inlet is situated 
below the groundwater level in the vacuum extraction pipe (30). 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the perforations in the riser pipe (44) are situated 
(1) only below the water table, or (2) both in the vadose zone and below the water table. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein gas is introduced into the vacuum 
extraction pipe (30) through the gas inlet (41) at a pressure greater or equal to than atmospheric 

pressure, and preferably from about atmospheric pressure to about 100 pounds per square 
inch, more preferably from about 20 to about 60 pounds per square inch. 
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the vacuum extraction pipe (30) bottom

A process according to any of the preceding claims wherein the common stream
