<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for modifying the 
surface properties of aramid fibers by applying novel 
finishes. The surface treated aramids are especially 
useful in ballistic applications. Also disclosed are 
the coated aramid fibers themselves. Finishes are applied to fibers, including aramid 
fibers, for numerous reasons, such as avoiding fiber 
damage during processing, lessening friction with 
processing equipment so the equipment is not worn out 
quickly and the fiber is easily processed, modifying the 
feel ("hand") of the fiber, etc. For ballistic uses, 
aramid fibers with two conflicting properties are 
desired - low coefficient of friction with the process 
equipment, usually metal and/or ceramic, and a high 
fiber-fiber coefficient of friction, particularly when 
both are measured at higher speeds. The latter is 
believed to give fabric with improved ballistic 
properties. This sometimes necessitates the use of a 
first finish for processing, removal of the first 
finish, and then application of a second finish to 
provide high fiber-fiber friction. It is a goal of this 
invention to provide an aramid finish that gives fibers 
with relatively low fiber-metal (or ceramic) 
coefficients of friction, and relatively high fiber-fiber 
coefficients of friction. U.S. Patents 3,198,754 and 3,300,274 report that 
certain fluorinated aziridines and their polymers are 
useful for treating textiles. Aramids are not 
mentioned, and frictional properties are not discussed.  
 U.S. Patent 3,575,890 reports that certain 
fluorinated polyoxazolines can be used to treat fabrics 
to impart oil and water repellency. Aramids and 
frictional properties are not mentioned. U.S. Patents 3,147,065 and 3,147,066 report that 
certain fluorinated compounds containing quaternary 
ammonium groups can be used to treat textiles to impart 
oil and water repellency. Aramids and frictional 
properties are not mentioned. This invention concerns a process for treating 
aramid fibers, comprising, contacting an aqueous solution of a 
compound of the formula 
F(CF₂)nR²NR¹ 3 + X⁻,F(CF₂)nR³-C(=O)O-CH₂CH₂N(R¹)H2 + X⁻, 
or 
 
with an aramid fiber, and then drying said fiber, 
wherein: 
each R¹is independently hydrogen or alkyl 
containing 1, 2, 3, or 4 carbon atoms; R²is alkylene; R³is hydrocarbylene or a covalent bond; R⁴is methyl or ethyl;  
 nis an integer of 4 to 20; Xis an anion; yis 5 or more; and zis 1 or more. The invention also concerns an aramid fiber coated 
with a compound of the formula 
F(CF₂)nR²NR¹ 3 +
