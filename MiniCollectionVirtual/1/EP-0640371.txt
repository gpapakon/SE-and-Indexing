<ABSTRACT>
A liquid filter device for use with bottles 
holding wine or other liquids, for use in filtering 

cork or other sediments from the liquid while 
pouring the liquid out of the bottle, comprising a 

generally tubular body (12) which may be inserted into 
the neck of a bottle (20), where the body has a top 

portion open to the internal volume of the filter 
device and a bottom portion sealed from the 

internal volume, openings (22) formed in the body, a 
filter (24) located on the inside of the body to cover 

such openings and means (18) for strengthening said body 
being integrally formed thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device used to filter 
out sediments, including cork, from a wine bottle or 
other bottle when the liquid therein is being poured out. 
It is a common problem that the cork in a wine bottle may 
be broken or severely damaged in an attempt to remove it 
from the neck of the bottle. Even if the damaged cork is 
removed from the bottle, it is highly likely that a 
portion of the cork will remain in the bottle and will be 
poured out with the wine or other liquid. In some cases 
it is impossible to completely remove the cork and is 
necessary to push the remaining cork into the bottle 
where it may contaminate the liquid with cork particles. 
Another use of such a device may be for bottles which 
have fruit pieces floating in the liquid for flavour. It 
is preferable to be able to pour the liquid out of the 
bottle without the fruit particles and without the need 
for a strainer. EP-A-210915 shows a cartridge for use in the 
production of sparkling wine. It is not intended to 
provide a filtering function while the wine is being 
poured. GB-A-2219520 shows a stopper which is inserted into 
a wine bottle after removal of the cork. The stopper 
opens into a hollow body with an open end and an air vent 
at the top. A mesh covers the lower part of the open 
end. It is an object of this invention to present a 
simple and inexpensive mechanism for use in filtering 
cork or other sediments from a bottle while pouring 
liquid out of the bottle. While this invention is most 
readily used in wine bottles due to the common use of 
corks with such bottles, it may be used in any similar 
bottle and the invention is not so limited. It is a 
further object of this invention to present a bottle  
 
filter mechanism which can also be used to assist in 
pushing the cork or other stopper into the bottle for 
access to the liquid. According to the invention, there is provided a 
liquid filter device for use with a bottle, comprising a 
generally tubular body which may be inserted into the 
neck of the bottle, the body having a top portion open to 
the internal volume of the body, a bottom portion sealed 
from the internal volume and means for strengthening the 
body integrally formed thereon, characterised by: 
openings formed in the lower part of the body, about its 
circumference; filtering means mounted on the body to 
cover the openings, the filtering means being arranged to 
filter liquid as it enters the internal volume of the body from 
within the bottle; and a vent in the bottom portion for
