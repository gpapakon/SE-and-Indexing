<ABSTRACT>
An incinerator of sectional structure has an airpipe (36) for sending 
combustion air into a furnace. The airpipe is a straight pipe tapered 

off at end portion and closed by a plug (44) of castable refractory 
material filled up in the tapered portion (45) to improve the durability 

under high temperature circumstances. The airpipe is also inserted into 
a furnace through a hole (46) opened on an upper furnace wall, and a 

seal member (47) of easy spallable and castable refractory material 
fills up the gap between the airpipe and the hole to make easy exchange 

of the airpipe possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an incinerator having an 
airpipe for inducting combustion air into a furnace, especially 
a furnace having a sectional structure comprising an injection 
block, a flue block and an intermediate block inserted between 
the above two blocks according to the required furnace capacity. It is known that each block of the sectional structure has 
an airpipe. Each airpipe may uniformly provide combustion air 
into the furnace. The capacity of the furnace can be increased 
by adding or changing the intermediate block. Providing uniform 
air to the furnace produces less harmful gas because of the 
efficient combustion. The sectional structure may also easily 
provide for several kinds of incinerators having different 
burning capacities by changing the pipe connections and the 
blowing power from the exterior of the furnace. Each block of the sectional structure also has a steel outer 
wall coated with an inner refractory lining layer, ensuring long, 
safe operation. Still, a steel airpipe will be easily worn out 
by oxidation by being subjected to a constant high temperature. 
The tip portion close to an end wall suffers more severe losses 
than other portions of the airpipe. The combustion air's cooling 
is not sufficient for the tip portion and cracks at the pipe end 
caused by welding the end wall induce the oxidation. Finally, 
the end portion of the airpipe drops off the end wall and opens 
a straight path that prevents the uniform jet of combustion air 
through the airpipe and forces replacement of the whole airpipe. The airpipe is also directly coated with the refractory 
lining of the outer wall. Therefore, the replacement of the  
 
airpipe requires very laborious work to break the strong 
refractory layer. A blower for the airpipe will suspend operation immediately 
after an access door begins to open. Stopping the blower acts 
to suppress the flame from shooting out the refuse access port 
by stopping the supply of pressurized air into the furnace 
through the airpipe. Still, there is a small unavoidable time 
lag before the pressure in the furnace drops to atmospheric level 
after starting to open the door. Therefore, an operator in front 
of the access port cannot work safely because of the possibility 
of the flame shooting through the opening. It was known (US-A- 4 823 710) to provide the side walls of a 
steam generating boiler having a bottom wall supporting a char 
bed with ports through which combustion air is admitted for combustion 
of the combustible
