<ABSTRACT>
A surgical shunt (20) capable of revision and inspection on a minimal invasive basis is provided. The shunt (20) comprises a ventricle tube (22) and drain tube (30) connected by an elbow (24). The elbow (24) has branches (25) and a bend therein so as to connect the tubes (22, 30) at nearly a right angle. A portal (26) is mounted on the bend of said elbow (24). The portal (26) comprises a concave slit valve (46) and a portal cover (48) thus forming a self-sealing access to the shunt (20). The portal (26) is oriented on the elbow (24) so as to allow passage therethrough into either of said tubes (22, 30) by an angioscope or other device. Thus, the angioscope or other device can be externally inserted into the interior regions of the shunt (20) in order to remove blockages and improve cerebrospinal fluid flow without surgical procedures. An external conduit (54) runs parallel along the length of the drain tube (30). This conduit (54) contains a number of openings (56) along its length for the delivery of antibiotics and other therapeutic substances to the tissues surrounding the shunt (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shunting device for 
cerebrospinal fluid ("CSF") and, more 
particularly, to a CSF shunt which is capable of inspection 
and revision on a minimal invasive basis, thereby greatly 
reducing the pain and risk to the patient associated with 
previous shunt revision procedures. In addition, since the 
shunt revision can be performed on an out-patient basis, the 
cost of previous shunt revision surgical procedures is greatly 
reduced. The valve regulated drainage of cerebrospinal fluid is an 
important neurosurgical intervention for the treatment of 
hydrocephalus, or "water on the brain." Hydrocephalus is 
caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid being located between the 
brain and skull. When congenital, hydrocephalus may result in 
excessive skull enlargement and, if untreated, progress to 
brain damage, or even death. When the condition occurs later 
in a person's life, the skull is no longer flexible and the 
condition can cause headaches, vomiting, and loss of 
coordination and mental functioning. Hydrocephalus is commonly treated by providing a drain 
tube, known as a "shunt," between the source of the fluid 
within a ventricular cavity of the patient and another body 
cavity, such as the abdomen, chest, or vascular system (i.e., 
a major blood vessel, such as the jugular vein). Thus, in 
order to maintain the size of a child's skull at normal 
dimensions and to relieve pressure, the cerebrospinal fluid is 
drained or shunted to other parts of the body. In order to install the shunt, a scalp incision is made 
and a small hole is drilled in the skull. The proximal end of 
the shunt is installed in the ventricular cavity. The distal 
end of the shunt is then installed in that portion of the body 
into which the cerebrospinal fluid is to be drained.  
 CSF shunts normally comprise a cannula or tubing system 
which is commonly fabricated from silasticÂ®, a material made by 
Dow-Corning. The ventricular or proximal end of the shunt is 
provided with small openings that vary from microns to 
millimeters in order to receive the cerebrospinal fluid into 
the shunt tubing. Likewise, the distal end of the shunt also 
is provided with small openings, often shaped as slits, to 
discharge the fluid from the shunt into the appointed body 
cavity. The shunts usually have an internal diameter of 
approximately 1.5 mm and are provided with a system of valves. 
The valves are generally one way, only allowing fluid to pass 
out of the ventricular cavity. Each valve is designed to open 
due

A shunting device (20) for cerebrospinal fluid, said device 
comprising: 


a ventricle tube (22) adapted to be inserted through a 
skull and into a ventricle of a patient, said ventricle 

tube (22) having openings (21) for receiving said 
cerebrospinal fluid into said ventricle tube (22) for 

draining said cerebrospinal fluid to another location; 
a drain tube (30) in fluid communication with said 
ventricle tube (22) for draining said cerebrospinal fluid 

to another location within the patient, said drain tube 
(30) having openings (32, 36) to allow said cerebrospinal 

fluid to drain out of said shunting device (20); 
wherein said ventricle tube (22) and said drain tube (30) 
are joined at an angle (24) with respect to one another, 

characterized in that a valved access opening (26) is 
located at said angle (24) to provide external access for 

an endoscopic device (60 - 72) for inspecting and cleaning 
said shunting device (20), and to provide external access 

to said drain tube (30) and said ventricle tube (22), such 
that said endoscopic device (60 - 72) may be inserted 

through said valved access opening (26) either in the 
ventrical tube (22) or the drain tube (30) in a straight 

line. 
The shunting device of claim 1, wherein said drain tube 
further comprises an external conduit (54) for receiving 

therapeutic products, and openings (56) are arranged in the 
wall of the external conduit (54) to allow said therapeutic 

products to escape into the tissues surrounding said 
shunting device (20). 
The shunting device of claim 2, wherein said drain tube 
(30) is substantially parallel to said external conduit 

(54) and integrally formed along at least one portion 
thereof.  

 
The shunting device of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said 
valved access opening comprises an access valve (44) 

comprising a resealable slit valve (46) formed in an 
elastic material having a relatively large surface area, 

said surface area providing access for said endoscopic 
device (60 - 72) to both said ventricle tube (22) and said 

drain tube (30). 
The shunting device of claim 4, wherein said valve (44) 
formed in said elastic material comprises a concave 

structure.
