<ABSTRACT>
The invention presents an arrangement for the releasable fastening of preferably planar elements in a system formed by posts and crossmembers, by means of which arrangement connection can take place without the use of screws. For this purpose, the invention presents a latch-in element (16, 17, 18) which engages in a space formed by parallel webs (9a, 9b) and latches in by the engagement of angled-off extensions (10a). For the screw-free assembly of posts and crossmembers, the invention discloses a component 3 which is introduced in a cutout (22, 22.1) and of which the lateral extensions (3.1a and 3.1b) project into chambers (12) of the crossmembers.
