<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an assembly of a first panel (1), 
comprising at least one insertion slot (11), and a second panel (2) 

comprising at least one projecting tab (21) extending outwardly of 
the second panel from one edge (22) thereof and fitting in said 

slot, wherein said tab has at least one shoulder (31) located 
between the top (32) and the base (33) of said tab, and wherein said 

shoulder is abutting on said first panel, with said one edge of the 
second panel remaining out of contact with said first panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a panel assembly and a mechanical
assembling method used therefor, particularly suitable for
application in apparatus.Most apparatus as e.g. a photographic camera, a processor for
exposed materials, an optoelectronic scanner, a xerographic copier,
a thermal printer, are mounted within a generally rectangular
housing, which may include a rectangular metal frame for supporting
various parts of the apparatus.In many of these apparatus, the mechanical geometry of the frame
panels, especially the relative distance between them, is very
important for guaranteeing a qualitative and reliable operation of
said apparatus.The frame of the apparatus thus has to be designed and manufactured
within rather small and robust tolerances, thereby minimising the
creation of disturbing splits between said panels. Thereabove the
frame thus formed needs a geometry which requires no adjustment
after it has been assembled and which is stable in time.In one prior art, precise positioning and fastening of two panels in
an apparatus was generally accomplished in a rather complicated way,
including crossbars with manually adjustable lengths or with fixed
high precision manufactured lenghts.In another prior art, in order to save mounting time, screw
receptacles were used as disclosed in USP 3,967,432 and as in
"Research Disclosure" no 34449 (December 1992). However, even with
these techniques, supplementary positioning means are still needed
for assembling the panels, thus requiring unevitable material costs.
Thereabove, this second prior art does not guarantee high
geometrical precision in the positions of said panels.US-A-4 535 704 discloses a panel assembly in which tabs on one panel extend
through slots in the other panel, a shoulder at one side of each tab providing support. Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved assembly of a first panel with another panel in a well
defined geometrical relationship such that the distance between said
panels is correct in at least one direction, and this without the
use of supplementary positioning means, or of complicated machining.
The improvement mainly consists in attaining a precise and stable
geometry for said assembly by money saving manufacturing and
mounting techniques.These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from
the following description.We now have found that the above objects can be achieved by
providing an assembly recording to claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A panel assembly comprising a first panel (1), having at
least one insertion slot (11), and a second panel (2) having

at least one projecting tab (21) projecting outwardly from
at least one edge (22) thereof to terminate in a free end

(32) and fitting into said insertion slot, said one edge of
the second panel being maintained out of contact with said first

panel, said tab including shoulders (31) located
between said free end of the tab and said one edge of said

second panel, said shoulder defining a generally straight
and perpendicular shoulder edge on each of two

opposite sides of said projecting tab, which edge is in abutting
contact with said first panel, said first panel having one

face (12) in said abutment with said shoulder edges of said second
panel and an opposite face remote from said shoulder edges,

and said free end (32) of said projecting
tab on said second panel is substantially flush with said

opposite face of said second panel.
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the cross
sectional shape of said projecting tab (21) corresponds

generally with the shape of said insertion slot (11).
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
second panel has at least two projecting tabs (43, 44) lying

substantially in a same plane and wherein said first panel
has corresponding insertion slots (41, 42) therein for

reception of said at least two tabs.
An assembly according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein said second panel (2) is provided with at least one

interconnection element for mechanially attaching said
second panel (2) to said first panel (1). 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein said
interconnection element comprises an angled portion (24) of

said second panel (2) partially surrounding said projecting
tab (21).
An assembly according to claim 5, wherein said second
panel (2) is attached to said first panel (1) by fastening

means (102) engaging the angled portion (24) and said first
panel (1).
An assembly according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein said panels (1, 2) are made from sheet metal which

has been punched to obtain the correct tab and slot configurations.
An assembly according to claim 6, wherein a portion of said second
panel has been cut and bent out of the plane thereof to form

said angled portion.
An assembly according to claim 5, further comprising a
resilient material (101) located between said first panel

(1) and the angled portion (24) of said second panel (2).
