<ABSTRACT>
The invention is predicated upon the discovery by applicants that 
exposure of a Ge surface to arsenic produces a drastic change in the step structure of 

the Ge surface. Subsequent exposure to Ga and growth of GaAs produces three-dimensional 
growth and a high threading dislocation density at the GaAs/Ge 

interface. However exposure of the Ge surface to Ga does not substantially change 
the Ge step structure, and subsequent growth of GaAs is two-dimensional with little 

increase in threading dislocation density. Thus a high quality semiconductor 
heterostructure of gallium arsenide on germanium can be made by exposing a 

germanium surface (11) in an environment substantially free of arsenic, depositing a 
layer of gallium on the surface and then growing a layer of gallium arsenide (12). 

The improved method can be employed to make a variety of optoelectronic devices 
such as light-emitting diodes (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for making a semiconductor 
heterostructure of gallium arsenide on germanium. There is considerable interest in heterostructure devices involving 
greater epitaxial layer thickness and greater lattice misfit than present technology 
will allow. For example, it has long been recognized that germanium-silicon alloy 
GexSi1-x grown on silicon substrates would permit a variety of optoelectronic 
devices, such as LEDs, marrying the electronic processing technology of silicon 
VLSI circuits with the optical component technology of direct band semiconductors. 
Indeed, it has been proposed that an intermediate epitaxial layer of germanium-silicon 
alloy would permit the epitaxial deposition of gallium arsenide overlying a 
silicon substrate and thus permit a variety of new optoelectronic devices. However, 
despite the widely recognized potential advantages of such combined structures and 
despite substantial efforts to develop them, their practical utility has been limited by 
high defect densities in heterostructure layers. A highly advantageous method for making a semiconductor 
heterostructure of germanium-silicon alloy on silicon is disclosed in EP-A-0514018 
(inventors Brasen et al). The Brasen et al application discloses that one can grow on 
silicon large area heterostructures of graded GexSi1-x alloy having a low level of 
threading dislocation defects by growing the alloy at high temperatures in excess of 
about 850°C and increasing the germanium content at a gradient of less than about 
25% per µm. Using this method one can grow low defect heterolayers of high 
germanium alloy. The next step toward the long sought goal of direct band optoelectronics 
on silicon is a method for growing a low defect heterolayer of gallium arsenide on a 
layer of germanium. Efforts to grow GaAs on group IV semiconductors predominantly begin 
with the growth of a prelayer of arsenic on the group IV substrate. The use of As 
prelayers has dominated GaAs/Si experiments because: a) As pre-layers are self-limiting, 
i.e. only one monolayer will deposit; and b) the As background pressure in 
most systems is high, so in the absence of special precaution, an As prelayer is  
 
unavoidable. Experiments have been conducted using Ga prelayers in GaAs growth 
on Si but the GaAs growth is equally poor (three-dimensional) using Ga or As 
prelayers. (See, for example, R. D. Bringans et al, Appl.Phys.Lett. 51,523 (1987) 
and M. Zinke-Allmang et al, Surf.Sci.Rep. 16,446 (1992). Despite the closer lattice
