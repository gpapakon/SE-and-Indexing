<ABSTRACT>
Anticentrifugal active lateral suspension apparatus for 
balancing the non-compensated centrifugal acceleration 

along a curve of a railway vehicle (F), including fluid 
pressure jacks (8, 9), interposed transversally between 

the body (1) and the opposite sides of each bogie (2, 
3), valve means (18, 19) for connecting alternatively 

the jacks with a source of fluid under pressure (14) 
and transducers adapted to detect the non-compensated 

centrifugal acceleration and to generate corresponding 
piloting signals for the said valve means (18, 19) so 

as to apply, by means of the said jacks (8, 9), a force 
contrasting the centrifugal force acting on the body. 

The transducers comprise two accelerometers (21, 22) 
placed in proximity of the opposite ends of the vehicle 

(F) and whose signals are supplied to an electronic 
processing unit (20) arranged selectively to pilot the 

said valve means (18, 19) in different modes. 
The valve means (18, 19) are electronic servo valves or 
proportional valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a railway vehicle 
having an active lateral suspension apparatus, 
comprising a body, two bogies placed in proximity of 
the body ends, and vertical and lateral suspension 
means between the body and the two bogies, said 
apparatus including fluid pressure jacks interposed 
transversely between the body and each bogie, valve 
means for connecting said fluid pressure jacks with a 
source of fluid under pressure, and transducer means 
adapted to produce piloting signals for the said valve 
means so as to control operation of said fluid pressure 
jacks, wherein said transducer means comprise two 
accelerometers placed in proximity of the opposite ends 
of the vehicle and whose signals are fed to an 
electronic processing unit operatively connected to 
said valve means. A railway vehicle of the above-referenced type is known 
from GB-A-2.025.572, disclosing an apparatus for 
actively absorbing and damping vibrations of the 
vehicle body. Accordingly, the two accelerometers as 
disclosed in the embodiments of this known vehicle are 
horizontal vibrational accelerometers whose piloting 
signals are, therefore, related to yawing vibrations of 
the vehicle body. These yawing vibrations are to be 
suppressed, in response to the piloting signals 
generated by the horizontal vibrational accelerometers, 
by means of a single double-acting hydraulic cylinder 
for each bogie; the apparatus in 
GB-A-2.025.572 is specifically designed to suppress  
 
these yawing vibrations, together with vertical and 
angular vibrations by means of further vibrational 
accelerometers. Specification of "vibrational" 
accelerometers for this purpose means that the known active apparatus 
is not specifically designed 
to perform the particular function of effectively 
balancing the non-compensated centrifugal acceleration 
acting on the body when the vehicle is travelling along 
a curve. In addition to the above, the apparatus according to 
GB-A-2.025.572, in each of the alternative embodiments 
disclosed therein, has a poor flexibility in adapting 
the active control apparatus to actual operating 
conditions, even as regards vehicle travel in either 
direction, which is an important requirement in railway 
operation. On the other hand, known apparatuses specifically 
designed for detecting and balancing the non-compensated 
centrifugal acceleration acting on a  
 
railway vehicle body negotiating a curve, such as 
currently installed on board of railway vehicles, 
employ generally complex and scarcely
