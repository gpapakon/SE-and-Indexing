<ABSTRACT>
Device for the transport and the positioning of work-piece carriers in the form of a linear unit - having a drive shaft (2) and a spatial cam mechanism (3) with a web cam (4). The web cam of the spatial cam mechanism consists of a transport section (4a) with a helical pitch and a pitch-free positioning and rest section (4b). The web cam of the spatial cam mechanism is arranged on several modules (7) in the shape of a hollow shaft, each of which has a full positioning and rest section as well as a part of the transport section adjoining the positioning and rest section on both sides. The modules are slipped onto the drive shaft in such a way as to be locked against rotation and are fastened to it with abutting parts of the transport sections. Of the two rollers (6) of the work-piece carrier (1), one is constructed as a guide roller (6a) with a fixed spindle (8) and the other is constructed as a pretensioning roller (6b) with a pretensioning spring (9). The pretensioning roller (6b) presses the guide roller against the allocated guide surface (10) of the web cam. The curvature of the transition web sections (4c) at the further parts of the web cam and the pretensioning force of the tension spring are adapted to one another.

An apparatus for the transport and positioning 
of workpiece carriers (1) which is designed as a linear unit, 

- having a drive shaft (2), a three-dimensional cam drive (3) 
with a path cam (4) on the drive shaft (2) and a workpiece 

carrier guidance device (5), wherein the workpiece carriers 
(1) have two rollers (6) on the cam drive side which are 

guided on the path cam (4), one of which rollers is designed 
as a guide roller (6a) with a fixed axis (8), wherein the path 

cam (4) of the three-dimensional cam drive (3) consists of a 
transport section (4a) having a helical slope (S) and of a 

slope-free positioning and support section (4b), and the 
transport section (4a) and the positioning and support section 

(4b) are connected to each other by a curved transition path 
section (4c), wherein the path cam (4) of the three-dimensional 

cam drive (3) is disposed on a plurality of 

modules (7) in the form of hollow shafts which are slid 
rotationally fixed on to the drive shaft (2) and are fixed to 

the latter with portions of the transport sections (4a) 
abutting, characterised in that 


a) each module (7) comprises, on both sides, a portion 
of the transport section (4a) which adjoins the 

positioning and support section (4b), 
b) that the second roller is designed as a biassing 
roller (6b) having a biassing spring (9), which 

biassing roller (6b) presses the guide roller (6a) on  
 

to the associated guide face (10) of the path cam 
(4), 
c) and that the curvature of the transition path 
sections (4c), the regions of the transition path 

sections (4c) connecting them to the other parts of 
the path cam (4), and the biassing force of the 

biassing spring are matched to each other so that the 
motion of the workpiece carriers (1) is executed free 

from vibration and the derivative with respect to 
time of the curve of motion of the workpiece carriers 

(1) is practically constant. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the 
transport section (4a) has a constant slope (S). 
An apparatus according to either one of claims 1 
or 2, wherein the portions of mutually abutting modules (7) 

form transport sections (4a) which have a different slope (S) 
from module pair to module pair. 
An apparatus according to any one or claims 1 to 
3, wherein the positioning and support sections (4b) of 

mutually abutting modules are of different length from module 
(7) to module (7). 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the modules (7) of the apparatus can be assembled 

in a different sequence and/or in different numbers. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the guide race (10) of the path cam (4) is machined 

to particularly low tolerances and with a particular surface  
 

quality. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 
6, wherein the biassing rollers (6b) can be fitted with 

biassing springs (9) of different biassing force. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 
7, wherein the biassing force of the biassing springs (9) is 

adjustable. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 
8, wherein the guide roller (6a) with the fixed axis (8) has a 

spindle pin (11) which is inserted in a bore in the associated 
workpiece carrier (1) and passes through the bore, and wherein 

the spindle pin (11) forms the fixed positioning point on the 
workpiece carrier (1) for a workpiece cluster disposed on the 

workpiece carrier (1). 
An apparatus according to claim 9, wherein all 
the modules (7) are of the same identical design and are flat-ground 

with narrow tolerances on their end faces and are 
braced against each other.
