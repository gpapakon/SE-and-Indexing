A generator supplying high-frequency power to an arc 
lamp (12) comprising a primary circuit (1) connected up to 

the terminals (5, 6) of the alternating power-supply mains 
and incorporating an electromagnetic inductor (L', T) 

connected to a high-frequency resonant circuit (7), and a 
secondary circuit (2) incorporating the arc lamp (12) and 

magnetically coupled to said primary circuit (1), 
characterized in that said secondary circuit (12) comprises 

in series with-the arc lamp (12) an electromagnetic sensor 
(E
1
, E
2
) making it possible to provide for magnetic 
coupling with the primary circuit (1) at high frequency, 

said secondary circuit (2) being formed by two electrical 
circuits (10, 11) mounted in parallel with the terminals of 

the lamp (12), each of the two circuits (10, 11) 
incorporating an electromagnetic sensor coupled with the 

electromagnetic inductor of the primary circuit (1). 
The generator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the circuit 
(11) forming the secondary circuit (2), intended to deliver 

the rated operating voltage for maintaining the arc of the 
lamp (12) and to deliver to the latter the current 

necessary for illuminating it, includes in series with the 
lamp (12), an inductor (L''') and, in parallel with the 

terminals of said inductor (L"'), a third circuit (17) 
incorporating, in series, a diode (D3) and an 

electromagnetic relay (16), said relay being capable of 
activating or deactivating a switch (15) connected to the 

terminals of the diode (D
1
) of said circuit (11) depending 
on the state of the arc in the lamp (12), and therefore 

capable of preventing, on the one hand, the windings (E
1
) 
and (E
2
) from short-circuiting when striking the arc in the 
lamp (12), the switch (15) then being open and, on the 

other hand, of supplying the arc with alternating current 
after striking, the switch (15) then being closed and 

shunting the diode (D
1
).  
 
The generator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the two 
circuits (10, 11) forming the secondary circuit (2) each 

incorporate a diode (D
1
, D
2
), mounted so as to conduct 
towards the lamp (12), in order to prevent the two 

electromagnetic sensors (E
1
, E
2
) from short-circuiting 
together, upon striking the arc of the lamp (12). 
The generator as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the electromagnetic inductor of the primary circuit 

(1) is formed by an inductor (L) mounted in series with the 
primary winding of a transformer (T), and the two 

electromagnetic sensors of the secondary circuit (2) are 
formed by two independent secondary windings of the same 

transformer (T). 
The generator as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the respective electromagnetic sensors and the 

electromagnetic inductor of the secondary (2) and primary 
(1) circuits are formed by inductors, the magnetic coupling 

of the two primary and secondary circuits taking place 
through the air or in a medium of magnetic permeability 

equal to 1, in the absence of any magnetic circuit. 
The generator as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein one (E
2
) of the electromagnetic sensors, intended 
to deliver the voltage for striking the arc of the arc lamp 

(12), is formed by the sum of two sensors (E
1
, E') mounted 
in series, the sensor E
1
 being connected via the diode (D
1
) 
to one of the terminals of the lamp (12) and being intended 

to deliver the rated operating voltage for maintaining the 
arc of said lamp and to deliver to the latter the current 

necessary for illuminating it. 
The generator as claimed in claim 1: 

wherein the electromagnetic sensor (E
1
), intended to 
deliver the rated operating voltage for maintaining the arc 

of the lamp (12) and to deliver to the latter the current  
 

necessary for illuminating it, is connected to the 
terminals of a voltage rectifier bridge (14) operating at 

high frequency, the output terminals of which are connected 
to the lamp (12) ; 
and wherein the electromagnetic sensor (E
2
), intended 
to deliver the voltage for striking the arc of the arc lamp 

(12), is also connected to the terminals of said lamp (12), 
via an electrical circuit (10), one of the branches of 

which incorporates a diode (D
2
). 
The generator as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the primary circuit (1) includes a voltage 

rectifier bridge (4) connected up to the terminals (5, 6) 
of the power supply mains, and with which are mounted, in 

series, on the one hand, at least one rapid switch (I) and, 
on the other hand, a parallel resonant circuit (7) 

comprising, in parallel, a transformer (T) and the inductor 
(L) on the one hand, and a capacitor (
C) on the other hand, 
for the purpose of magnetic coupling by the transformer, or 

a single inductor (L') mounted in parallel with a capacitor 
(C) for the purpose of magnetic coupling through the air. 
The generator as claimed in claim 8, wherein the primary 
circuit (1) includes, in parallel with the resonant circuit 

(7) and the rapid switch (I), a capacitor (C
0
) intended to 
filter out the high-frequency components of the supply 

current by induction and thus to prevent any risk of these 
components being transferred to the power-supply mains. 
The generator as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4 and 
7, wherein the primary circuit (1) includes a voltage 

rectifier bridge (4) connected up to the terminals (5, 6)
