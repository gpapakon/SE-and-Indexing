<ABSTRACT>
A cigarette (10) includes a filter element (30) including a 
carbon-containing paper (57) or a paper containing molecular 

sieves. The paper contacts the filter material (55), such as 
cellulose acetate tow, within the filter element, either by 

circumscribing the filter material or by being gathered with 
non-carbon-containing filter material. The paper is useful 

as a plug wrap for a filter element. In several embodiments, 
longitudinal grooves are provided on the periphery of the 

filter element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to smoking articles such 
as cigarettes, and in particular, to cigarettes having filter 
elements containing a carbonaceous material. Popular smoking articles, such as cigarettes, have a 
substantially cylindrical rod shaped structure and include a 
charge of smokable material such as shredded tobacco (e.g., 
in cut filler form) surrounded by a paper wrapper thereby 
forming a so-called "tobacco rod." Normally, a cigarette has 
a cylindrical filter element aligned in an end-to-end 
relationship with the tobacco rod. Typically, a filter 
element includes cellulose acetate tow circumscribed by plug 
wrap, and is attached to the tobacco rod using a 
circumscribing tipping material. It also has become 
desirable to perforate the tipping material and plug wrap, in 
order to provide dilution of drawn mainstream smoke with 
ambient air. Cigarettes are employed by the smoker by lighting one 
end thereof and burning the tobacco rod. The smoker then 
receives mainstream smoke into his/her mouth by drawing on 
the opposite end (e.g., the filter end) of the cigarette. Certain cigarettes have filter elements which 
incorporate materials such as carbon. Exemplary cigarettes 
and filters therefor are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
2,881,770 to Tovey; 3,353,543 to Sproull et al.; 3,101,723 to 
Seligman et al.; and 4,481,958 to Ranier et al. and European 
Patent Application Publication No. 532,329. Certain 
commercially available filters have particles or granules of 
carbon (e.g., an activated carbon material or an activated 
charcoal material) dispersed within cellulose acetate tow; 
other commercially available filters have carbon threads 
dispersed therein; while still other commercially available 
filters have so-called "cavity filter" or "triple filter"  
 
designs. Exemplary commercially available filters are 
available as SCS IV Dual Solid Charcoal Filter from American 
Filtrona Corp.; Triple Solid Charcoal Filter from FIL 
International, Ltd.; Triple Cavity Filter from Baumgartner; 
and ACT from FIL International, Ltd. See, also, Clarke et 
al., World Tobacco, p. 55 (Nov., 1992). Cigarette filter elements which incorporate carbon have 
the ability to change the character of mainstream smoke which 
passes therethrough. For example, such filter elements have 
the propensity to reduce the levels of certain gas phase 
components present in the mainstream smoke, resulting in a 
change in the organoleptic properties of that smoke. However, such filter elements often incorporate
