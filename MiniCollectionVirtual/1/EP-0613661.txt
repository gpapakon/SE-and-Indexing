<ABSTRACT>
A surgical instrument in which a surgical tool (12) is 
carried distally of a bend region (20) in a stationary 

support member (14) by an assembly (22) that transmits proximally 
applied forces and selectively change the rotational 

orientation of the surgical tool with respect to the 
stationary member. In another respect, in which the 

stationary member does not include a bend region, a 
rotatable member (26,32) supported by the stationary member 

transmits rotational force to the surgical tool to 
selectively change the rotational orientation of the 

tool, and a driver member (34) supported by the stationary 
member transmits axial force to the surgical tool to 

operate it. In still another respect in which the 
stationary member includes the bend region but the 

surgical tool is not rotatable, a movable member (316) 
supported by the stationary member is constructed to 

transmit a proximally applied axial force through the 

bend region to operate a surgical tool disposed in a 
distal region of the instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical instruments,
and in particular to arthroscopic surgical instruments.Surgical instruments such as for arthroscopy
typically include a straight, stationary member that
distally supports a surgical tool as a fixed rotational
position with respect to the axis of the member. Tissue
or bone is exposed to the surgical tool through an
opening in the distal end of the stationary member. An
actuating member is either rotated or reciprocated to
operate the surgical tool and cause it to grasp or
sever body material (such as tissue or bone). The
actuating member is driven either manually by the user
or by a motor. The user (eg. a surgeon) changes the
rotational orientation of the surgical tool by manually
rotating orientation of the surgical tool by manually
rotating the instrument. In some instruments in which
the tool cuts tissue, severed body material and
irrigation fluid are withdrawn from the surgical site
through a transport passage in the actuating member (or
through anther device) in response to applied suction.The surgical tool may include a tissue cutting or
bone abrading implement, or an implement such as
forceps or grasper for gripping body material. In
so-called "punch" arthroscopic instruments, the
surgical tool includes a hinged jaw and a stationery
jaw mounted on the stationary member near its distal
end. The actuating member pivots the hinged jaw,
thereby closing and opening the jaws to cut tissue.
Examples of these surgical instruments are described in
US Patent Nos. 4,522,206, 4,662,371, both of which are
assigned to the present assignee. In arthroscopic scissor instruments, either or
both cutting jaws are hinge. A grasper typically includes jaws that
lack cutting edges so as to grasp, rather than cut, body material
when the jaws are closed.Other types of surgical tools include a rotating cutting blade
(examples of which are described in US Patent Nos. 4203444,
4274414, 4834729) or a bone-abrading burr (an example of which is
described in US Patent No. 4842578). All of these patents are
assigned to the present assignee.In some arthroscopic instruments the actuating member
rotates within the stationary member. The outer, stationary member
is sometimes curved to facilitate positioning a cutting implement
against tissue to be cut without requiring that the instrument be
removed from the body and reinserted through an additional
puncture. In one such instrument, the portion of the actuating
member disposed within the curve includes a separate flexible
section made
