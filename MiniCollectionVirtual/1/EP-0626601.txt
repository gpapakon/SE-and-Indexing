<ABSTRACT>
An overmolded alignment ferrule for an optical fiber 
connector having a high precision preformed 

portion (12) has a lower precision overmolded body 
portion (14), the high precision portion (12) including an 

anti-displacement 
feature (22) and a anti-flexural feature (40) 

for preventing flexural, rotational or torsional 
movement of the high precision portion (12) relative to the body 

portion (14). The overmolded alignment ferrule is 
formed by overmolding the body portion (14) about the high 

precision portion (12) generally surrounding and 
embedding the anti-displacement features (22) and the 

anti-flexure feature (40) and extending rearward 
therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to alignment ferrules used 
in optical fiber connectors for aligning optical fibers 
with mating fiber optic devices. A fiber optic connector within the field of this 
invention utilizes the precise dimensions of an 
alignment ferrule to accurately align an optical fiber 
therein with a mating fiber optic device. Typically, 
the ferrule will have a high precision front section 
that is concentric with a central passage in which the 
optical fiber is held, whereby orientation of the front 
section also orientates the corresponding optical fiber. 
A lower precision body portion is used to incorporate 
the ferrule into the fiber optic connector. These 
ferrules may be used either singularly or in conjunction 
with others. Ferrules have been manufactured using a variety of 
methods to accommodate the high precision, and its 
associated costs, at the front section, while realizing 
cost savings through the lower precision requirements of 
the body portion. U.S. Pat. No. 4,634,214 discloses a 
two-piece ferrule where the front section is a 
cylindrical ceramic piece that is frictionally fit or 
bonded within a collar of a lower precision rear 
section. U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,122 discloses a ferrule that is 
made from metal or thermoplastic material having the 
high precision front section and the body portion 
integrally formed. A bipartite ferrule may also be 
produced by attaching the front section to the rear body 
portion through the use of mechanical means, such as 
threads or bosses, or through bonding means, such as the 
use of heat, ultrasonic, or adhesive techniques. Another ferrule, made from injection molded 
plastic, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,487. This 
is a one piece ferrule that has a precision front  
 
section and a body portion formed such that the 
precision front section is free of molding flash. The ferrules disclosed in the above patents have a 
number of drawbacks for high volume production. While 
the one piece ferrules have the necessary structural 
integrity, their production processes are limited by the 
high precision required at the front section. The two 
piece ferrules allow the manufacturing process and 
materials selection to be tailored to the particular 
sections of the ferrule, allowing for optimization of 
the manufacturing process. However, the two piece 
ferrules require joining features, such as threads, 
bores, or bosses, be incorporated. These additional 
features can impose the same precision requirements on 
the rear body section that

fiber connector having a precision portion(12) and a 

body portion(14) 
characterized in that: 

   said precision portion(12) has an anti-displacement 
member (21) thereupon, and 

   said body portion(14) is overmolded closely 
enclasping the anti-displacement member(21) and securely 

embedding the anti-displacement member(21) therein to 
prevent displacement of the precision portion(12) 

relative the body portion(14).

wherein the precision portion(12) includes an anti-flexure 

member(39) that extends from the rear section 
towards the front section to minimize deflection of the 

front section relative the rear section. 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 2, 
wherein the overmolded body portion(14) enclasps the 

anti-flexure member(39). 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 1, 
wherein the precision portion(12) is molded. 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 4, 
wherein a parting line imperfection(77) is along the 

rear section of the precision portion(12).

wherein the Precision portion(12) is plastic. 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 1, 
wherein the precision portion(12) and the body 

portion(14) are different materials. 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 1, 
wherein the anti-displacement member is a collar that 

extends outward beyond the front section of the 
precision portion(12). 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 8, 
wherein a rib(40) extends from the collar(22) along the 

precision portion to minimize flexure of the front 
section(16) relative the rear section(18). 
A two-piece alignment ferrule(2) of Claim 8, 
wherein a plurality of ribs(40) extend from the collar 

along the precision portion to minimize flexure of the
