<ABSTRACT>
An intrauterine pressure catheter system for 
monitoring pressure in the uterus of a mother during 

labor and delivery. The system includes a reusable 
junction box (12) with a needle communicating directly to a 

pressure transducer sensor. The sensor transmits changes 
in pressure to a conventional pressure monitor. A 

connector (32) attached to the catheter (22) is pushed into the 
junction box (12) and is held in place by a plastic latch (38). 

Inside this connector (32) are an elastomeric plug and an 
adjacent diaphragm. When the connector is installed in 

the junction box (12), the needle pierces the plug and the tip 
enters the air-filled volume between the plug and the 

diaphragm. Fluid pressure in the catheter (22) is 
communicated to the diaphragm surface and, in turn, 

passed to the air in the volume between the diaphragm and 
the plug. Thus, the intrauterine pressure is transmitted 

directly to the sensor. The system may be zeroed to 
atmosphere by simply removing the connector from the 

junction box (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
catheter system capable of monitoring changes in 
intrauterine pressure during labor and delivery. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to a system 
which combines a disposable catheter which can be 
latched, through a disposable connector, to a junction 
box containing a pressure sensor. The junction box and 
relatively expensive pressure sensor are reusable. The development of devices used to monitor 
intrauterine pressure in labor and delivery has vastly 
improved the ability of a physician to assess the health 
of both fetus and mother during childbirth. The use of 
such a device, often in conjunction with a fetal heart  
 
monitor, serves to warn a physician of potential problems 
before they become life-threatening. For example, an 
intrauterine pressure monitor allows a physician to 
assess whether adequate oxygen and nutrients are being 
transferred from mother to fetus and whether the rate, 
duration, and intensity of the intrauterine contractions 
are acceptable. Two types of devices are commonly used to 
monitor intrauterine pressure in a mother during labor 
and delivery. Often an external device secured to the 
mother's abdomen is used. For example, a pressure 
sensitive button, called a tocotransducer, capable of 
measuring the frequency and duration of intrauterine 
contractions is available. This type of external device 
has the advantage of being completely noninvasive. 
Therefore, it eliminates any threat of infection and 
risks little discomfort to the mother. External devices frequently provide inaccurate 
measurements of intrauterine pressure, however, because 
they are sensitive to excessive movement and to obesity 
of the mother. In addition, external devices are poorly 
capable of measuring the actual intensity of intrauterine 
contractions. For these reasons, an external device is 
ineffective in many childbirth situations, specifically, 
when there is risk of complication and the physician 
desires very accurate information. Devices capable of measuring intrauterine 
pressure when inserted into the uterus provide a more 
accurate measure of events during labor than the external 
devices and, in particular, a more accurate measure of 
intrauterine contraction intensity. Because the nature  
 
and duration of the contraction is measured directly, the 
intrauterine devices minimize the potential for 
inaccurate readings due to the mother's movement or 
obesity. Historically, the most common intrauterine 
devices are those
