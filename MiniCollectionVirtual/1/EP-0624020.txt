<ABSTRACT>
Device for continuously monitoring the integrity of a telephone line, transmitting an alarm signal, including a line-current detector (9) and a monitor (10) of the voltage between the two wires (2, 3) of this line, which units are mounted in a monitoring circuit (14) arranged in such a way that simultaneous detection of a lack of current in the line and of a drop in voltage, as a consequence of a persistent anomaly, corresponding to cutting of the line is immediately perceptible, and a time delay circuit (15), in series with the monitoring circuit, so that the detected anomaly is acted on only beyond a minimum duration threshold. According to the invention, this device is characterised in that it includes, in series with the time delay circuit, at the output of the monitoring circuit, a circuit (16) for control of a local alarm, comprising at least one relay (70), change over of which is determined by a signal issued by the monitoring circuit.
