<ABSTRACT>
An alkylative cycloaddition method is provided that is particularly useful for the synthesis of many of the Vitamin D analogues with differing side chains. Thus, a preferred synthesis is of Vitamin D analogues having a side chain R1 where a substantially geometrically pure first precursor having structure (I), and a second precursor are provided, the second precursor being a 1,7 enyne. These precursors are reacted in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form compounds having structure (II), where R2 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, fluorine, or a protecting group, and R3 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, fluorine, or a protecting group.

 PALLADIUM CATALYZED ALKYLATIVE CYCLIZATION USEFUL IN SYNTHESES OF VITAMIN D AND ANALOGUESField of the InventionThis invention generally relates to use of enynes in palladium catalyzed al ylative cyclizations, and more particularly where a 1,6-enyne or 1,7-enyne is reacted with a aryl halide, a vinyl halide, or an alkyl halide lacking a β-hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst to generate 1,2-bis-alkylidenecyclo- alkanes, such as Vitamin D analogues.Background of the InventionAs is well known. Vitamin D2 (also known as "calciferol") and Vitamin D3 (also known as "cholecal- ciferol") are effective in humans as antirachitic nutritional factors. Vitamin D2 is obtainable from ergosterol by uv irradiation in a suitable solvent, and Vitamin D3 can be obtained by irradiation of its provitamin, 7-dehydrocholesterol. In about the early 1970s, interest developed in lα,25-dihydroxychole- calciferol, which is the polar, biologically active, metabolite of Vitamin D3, due to an extremely rapidly onset of physiological activity. A few years later, another new Vitamin D3 analogue, again with rapid onset of physiological activity, was described by Barton et al (lα-hydroxy-Vitamin D3) . Several of these Vitamin D analogues are illustrated by reference to the Formula 1 structure. In the case of lα,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, X is hydroxyl as are both R2 and R3. For lα-hydroxy-Vitamin D3, X is hydrogen while both R2 and R3 are hydroxyl. 

 FORMULA 1The Formula 1 structure can be further generalized (and often is, particularly in description of syntheses) by more generally representing the side chain R1 of the Formula 1 representation is a part.Vitamin D analogue syntheses have received considerable attention, particularly recently, due to evidence that various Vitamin D3 related compounds are hormonally active and may be clinically useful regu¬ lators of various fundamental physiological processes. Thus, for example, 1,25-dihydroxy-Vitamin D3 has been shown to modulate the immune function of monocytes and macrophages, Huebel et al., "In-vivo Effect of 1,25- dihydroxy Vitamin D3 on Phagocyte Function in Hemodialysis Patients," Kidney International , 40 (5), pp. 927-933 (1991) . Calcipotriol (also known as "MC- 903") is an analogue of the physiologically active metabolite of Vitamin D3, lα,25-dihydoxycholecalciferol, which is indicated as efficacious in reducing in hyperproliferation for psoriasis patients by Arnold et al., "Induction of Epidermal Ornithine Decarboxylase Following Tape Stripping is Inhibited by a
