A differential housing for the axle drive of a motor vehicle, with a driving wheel and at 
least two rotationally symmetrical, pressed housing parts and crimped projections for 

mounting a differential pin, and with axle-drive shafts arranged extending transversely to 
the differential pin and having one axis of rotation, wherein one of the housing parts is 

constructed as a support part (3) provided with a casing (13) extending substantially continuously 
at an inclination with respect to the axis of rotation (14) and comprising a portion 

(15) provided with the projections (16), and the driving wheel is held on a flange (2) 
surrounding an opening (22) of the support part (3), and the said opening (22) is closed 

by at least one further housing part constructed as a cover (4), 
characterized in that
 the 
cover (4) is inserted into the opening (22) surrounded by the flange (2), and the drive 

wheel (1) is mounted only on the flange (2), and is welded to the flange on the outside 
thereof. 
A housing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the forces acting - in the direction 
of the axis of rotation (14) in the case of different rotational speeds of the axle-drive 

shafts (7) - upon a differential gear (8) mounted rotationally fixed on one of the said 
axle-drive shafts (7) are absorbed on a radially extending supporting face (17) of the support 

part (3). 
A housing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the flange (2) is situated at a 
greater distance radially from the axis of rotation (14) than the portion (15). 
A housing according to Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that
 a further supporting face 
(26) - facing the differential pin (11) - for a second differential gear (9) is provided on 

the cover (4). 
A housing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 on a portion of the casing (13) 
situated radially on the inside the support part (3) has a bearing seat (24) extending 

parallel to the axis of rotation (14) in order to support the differential housing. 
A housing according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the differential housing comprises 
a further part which is constructed as a sleeve (29) and which is held on the support 

part (3) adjacent to the supporting face (17) and is provided with a bearing seat (24) 
extending parallel to the axis of rotation (14) in order to support the differential housing.  

 
A housing according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the cover (4) is made essentially 
roof-shaped in cross-section, wherein a bearing seat (24) extending parallel to the axis of 

rotation (14) in order to support the differential housing is provided on an inclined portion 
(23), and a further inclined portion (25) is provided with the further supporting face 

(26), and the connecting area (27) of the two inclined portions (23, 25) is joined to an 
inner face (21) of the flange (2). 
A housing according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the cover (4) comprises a bearing 
seat (24) extending parallel to the axis of rotation (14) in order to support the differential 

housing, on which an inclined portion (23) extending from the bearing seat (24) to an 
inner face (21) of the flange (2) is formed. 
A housing according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 an angular insert part (28) on 
which the further supporting face (26) is formed is arranged in the region of the inclined 

portion (23). 
A housing according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the differential gear (8) or compensating 
gears (12) meshing therewith is or are arranged at a distance from the supporting 

face (17) or an inner face (21) of the casing (13), and the interspace formed thereby is 
filled with an initially liquid plastics material (30). 
A housing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the driving wheel is held non-releasably 
on the flange (2). 
A housing according to Claim 3 and/or 6, 
characterized in that
 the cover (4) and/or the 
sleeve (29) is held non-releasably on the support part (3). 
A housing according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the join between the cover (4) 
and the support part (3) as well as the driving wheel and the support part (3) is formed by 

laser welding. 
A housing according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the join between the sleeve (29) 
and the support part (3) is formed by friction welding.
