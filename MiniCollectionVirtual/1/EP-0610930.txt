<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a porous glass 
preform for an optical fiber and an apparatus for such a process 

are provided. In the process, fine glass particles are produced by 
heating and reacting vaporous starting materials for glass in a 

reaction vessel, the thus produced fine glass particles are 
deposited to obtain the porous glass preform and an exhaust gas 

speed through an exhaust duct which exhausts an exhaust gas 
containing non-deposited fine glass particles from the reaction 

vessel is controlled to be above 15 m/sec. Preferably, pressure 
fluctuation in the reaction vessel is minimized by supplying air 

from the outside of the reaction vessel to the exhaust duct. 
According to the present invention, the exhaust duct 
is not likely to be blocked by the non-deposited fine glass 

particles so that the stable production of the preform is 
maintained over an extended period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of a glass preform for an optical fiber and an 
apparatus for carrying out such a process. Particularly, the 
present invention relates to a process for the production of a 
porous glass preform in which non-deposited fine glass particles 
are prevented from their deposition to the inside of an exhaust 
duct and/or their residence within the exhaust duct when the 
glass preform is produced by deposition of fine glass particles, 
and also relates to an apparatus for such a process. As a process for the production of a glass preform 
for an optical fiber, a process using vapor phase reactions has 
been known. As an example of such a process, the inside 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, the outside chemical 
vapor deposition process and the vapor phase axial deposition 
process are known. In these processes, a vaporous starting 
material for glass flows out through an oxyhydrogen burner 
nozzle and a flame hydrolysis reaction occurs there, whereby 
fine glass particles produced from the reaction are deposited in 
the form of a rod to obtain the porous glass preform for the 
optical fiber in a reaction vessel. Fig. 2 schematically shows a prior art system for the  
 
production of the glass preform for the optical fiber. In such a 
system, the fine glass particles are produced from combustion of 
a starting material gas of glass such as SiCl4 gas, hydrogen gas 
and oxygen gas each flowing out of the burner 2 in the reaction 
vessel 1, and the particles are deposited on the seed rod 4 as the 
porous glass preform 3. The seed rod 4 is grasped and rotated 
and also lifted by the chuck means 5 as the fine glass particles 
are deposited thereon. In the process just described above, reactions occur 
according to the following reaction formulas in the reaction 
vessel in the case in which SiCl4 is used as the starting gas 
material of glass: 
H2 + 1/2 O2 → H2O + 57.8 Kcal/molSiCl4 + 2 H2O → SiO2 + 4 HClAs seen from the above formulas, heat of formation 
is generated due to the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen together 
with formation of SiO2 fine particles. Usually, about 50 to 90 % by weight of the fine glass 
particles produced according to the above reactions (SiO2 fine 
particles in this case) is deposited in the form of a column to 
produce the porous glass preform, and the balance is not 
deposited and exhausted through a outlet port 6 to the outside of 
the reaction vessel 1 by being entrained with an exhaust gas.
