<ABSTRACT>
A contact area of the biological tissue is cooled down at a rate of at least 180 K/min to -190 to -160  DEG C, after that it is rewarmed at a rate of 100 to 240 K/min to -70 to -20  DEG C with a subsequent rewarming at a rate of 10 to 25 K/min 15 to -5 to +5  DEG C and further rewarming up to the body temperature, the total time of controlled rewarming being shorter than 5 minutes. A device for carrying out this process consists of an operating apparatus with a built in container of cooling medium and operating instrument and control unit. The control unit is formed by a controlling microprocessor (1) coupled to electronic switches (4) of an electromagnetic valve (8) of the heat exchanger (17), heating (9) of the exchanger (17), further heating (11) of heater (13) of outlet gases and pressurized heating and the controlling microprocessor (1) is further connected to a measuring unit (5) coupled to a thermometer (10) of the heat exchanger (17), further thermometer (12) of heater of outlet gases, manometer (14) of the container, level indicators (15) and a further thermometer (16) of the pressurized heating. The controlling microprocessor (1) is coupled to an independent power supply (3) and external memory (2) and that is further connected to a display unit and keyboard (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the device for carrying out
cryosurgical interventions based on the destruction of
the pathological tissue consisting of freezing the
biological tissue below -25°C with its subsequent
rewarming up to the initial temperature. The device for
carrying out cryossurgical interventions comprising
operating apparatus with a built in container of cooling
medium and operating instrument and control unit.In the destruction of the pathological tissue by
the local deep undercooling for the therapeutic
treatment of bening as well as malignant tumors in the
proctology, gynaecology, oncological surgery, etc., the
biological tissue has been yet exposed to the action of
low temperature below -25°C. After that, the biological
tissue is rewarmed up to the initial body temperature.
In the still known methods rapid freezing with
subsequent rewarming up at a comparable speed is
performed.The disadvantage of this known procedure is
particularly a too high speed when rewarming the tissue
up to the initial temperature. For achieving a reliable
cryodestruction, in the literature, as well as in
accordance with experience in practice rapid cooling is
recommended down to temperatures below -25°C at a rate
of about 200 K/min or above with a subsequent moderate
rewarming up to the body temperature at a rate of 10 to
20 K/min. With respect to the necessary rewarming 
rate,the whole operation would be very time consuming
and this approach is not feasible with respect to the
fact that the intervention calls for a high degree of
concentration.For the methods mentioned, devices have been yet
known consisting of an operation apparatus with a built
in container of the cooling medium, most typically
liquid nitrogen. To the operation apparatus, an
operation instrument is attached having at its end
a heat exchanger or applicator arranged for fitting
operating tips as disclosed in US-A-4345598 on which the two-part form of
claim 1 is based.This device makes possible only rapid cooling and
comparably rapid rewarming of the tissue. Thus, the
drawback is in the impossibility of a suitable
continuous control of the cooling and particularly
rewarming rates. The temperature control is implemented
by the maximum rate given by the heating power of
relevant heat exchangers of the operating apparatus and
by their instantaneous thermal load. A further
disadvantage is in the impossibility of checking proper
fitting of tips to the operation instrument and thus
also the impossibility of checking the necessary contact
between the
