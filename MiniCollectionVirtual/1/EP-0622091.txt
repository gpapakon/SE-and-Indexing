<ABSTRACT>
The load transfer device and system having 
double safety cables (14, 16) permitting users (20) to 

move freely and safely along elevated surfaces comprises 
a plurality of elongated T-shaped support brackets (40) 

each having a body portion for anchoring to a support 
surface (18) and a head portion for receiving said 

safety cables (14, 16). A load transfer device (12) for 
slidable travel on the pair of cables (14, 16) and past 

the support brackets (40) comprises a rectangular plate 
(24) for receiving a lanyard (22), said plate (28) 

having a pair of elongated hook-shaped jaws (32, 34) 
hingedly secured to each edge of the rectangular plate 

(24) for receiving a safety cable (14, 16) therein, each 
said elongated hook-shaped jaw (32, 34) hinged to a side 

edge of the rectangular plate (24) whereby the said jaw 
(32, 34) is substantially planar with the plate (24) 

during no-load conditions and whereby the load transfer 
device (12) can freely pass a support bracket (40) 

during no-load conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a load transfer 
device and system and, more particularly, relates to a 
load transfer device and system which permits a user or 
other load attached thereto to move or be moved along a 
path and past load bearing supports. Safety line systems for use with horizontal 
life lines to protect workers from risk of injury or 
death from a fall when working close to a vertical face 
such as when washing windows of a high rise building are 
well known. U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,582,201 
discloses a load-transfer device for use by workers in 
the building and mining industries which enables a load 
to be moved along a path and past load bearing supports. 
A rotatable wheel having recesses in its periphery is 
adapted to slide along a single safety wire and to pass 
the loops of a hanger secured to a support surface. The Barrow Hepburn Sala SAYFGLIDAâ„¢ life line 
system (see WO-A-9117795 and WO-A-9220407) is another fall-arrest safety system which allows 
a worker to move safely along a horizontal plane tethered 
to a safety line. A link attached to a harness lanyard 
and travelling along a support line has a longitudinal 
slot formed along a side for passing the arm of a support 
bracket. FR-A-2 032 630 discloses a safety line system to protect 
mountain climbers from risk of injury from a fall. It comprises 
a load transfer device for travelling along a pair of cables. Said 
device consists out of a rectangular plate and a lever. The 
lever is pivotally secured to the plate on one of its sides 
for receiving a lanyard. The lever has an anchor pin adapted 
to engage the safety cables under load.  
 It is a principal object of the present 
invention to provide a load transfer device and system  
 
which allows users to move freely and safely along 
elevated surfaces. Another object of the invention is the 
provision of a load transfer device and system having 
double safety cables for an additional margin of safety 
while ensuring the load transfer device remains aligned 
with support brackets. A further object of the invention is the 
provision of a load transfer device having a pair of 
anchor jaws adapted to engage the safety cables when 
under load. These and other objects of the invention and 
the manner in which they can be attained will become 
apparent from the following description of the invention 
which, in its broad aspect, is a load transfer system 
comprising a plurality of elongated T-shaped support 
brackets each having a body portion for anchoring to a 
support
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A load transfer device (12) for travelling along a pair 
of safety cables (14,16) and past a support bracket (40) comprising a 

rectangular plate (24) having an eye (26) secured thereto on a side (28) 
of the plate (24) for receiving a lanyard (22), said plate having 

a pair of longitudinal side edges, and an elongated hook-shaped 
jaw (32,34) hingedly secured to each longitudinal side 

edge of the rectangular plate (24) for receiving a safety 
cable (14,16) therein on a side (78) of the plate (24) opposite to the side (28) 

having the eye (26), each said elongated hook-shaped jaw (32,34) 
having a longitudinal edge (71,72) adapted to mate with a 

longitudinal side edge of the rectangular plate (24) for 
receiving a hinge connection (36,38), whereby the said mating jaw 

edge (71,72) is substantially planar with the plate (28) and the 
opposite distal longitudinal jaw edge (74,76) is spaced from the 

plate (78) during no-load conditions to allow the load 
transfer device to pass a support bracket (40), and the mating 

jaw edge (71,72) is out of alignment with the plate (78) and the 
distal longitudinal jaw edge (72,74) substantially abuts the 

rectangular plate (78) to prevent the load transfer device (12) 
from passing a support bracket (40) when under load. 
A load transfer system comprising, in 
combination, a plurality of elongated T-shaped support 

brackets (40) each having a body portion (42) for anchoring to a 
support surface (18) and a transverse thin head portion (52) having 

a pair of longitudinal, parallel side edges (54,56), each said 
side edge having a longitudinal opening (58,60) formed therein  

 
for receiving a cable (14,16), a pair of equispaced cables seated 

in said longitudinal openings, and a load transfer device (12) 
mounted on said cables (14,16) for slidable travel on the cables 

and past the brackets (40). 
A load transfer system as claimed in claim 2, 
said load transfer device comprising a rectangular plate (24) 

having an eye (26) secured thereto on a side of the plate for 
receiving a lanyard (22), said plate having a pair of 

longitudinal side edges, and an elongated hook-shaped jaw (32,34) 
hingedly secured to each longitudinal edge of the 

rectangular plate (24) for receiving a safety cable (14,16) therein on 
a side (78) of the plate (24) opposite to the side (28) having the eye (26), 

each said elongated hook-shaped jaw (32,34) having a longitudinal 
edge (71,72) adapted to mate with a longitudinal side edge of the 

rectangular plate (24) for receiving a hinge connection (36,38), 
whereby the said mating jaw edge (71,72) is substantially planar 

with the plate (28) and the opposite distal longitudinal jaw 
edge (74,76) is spaced from the plate (78) during no-load conditions 

to allow the load transfer device to pass a support 
bracket (40), and the mating jaw edge (71,72) is out of alignment with 

the plate (78) and the distal longitudinal jaw edge (72,74) 
substantially abuts the rectangular plate (78) to prevent the 

load transfer device (12) from passing a support bracket (40) when 
under load.
