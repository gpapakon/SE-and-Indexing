<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with the preparation of a pseudorabies virus (PRV) mutant formed by a mutation in the nucleic acid sequence coding for polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of the invention. This mutation prevents expression of one or more of these polypeptides. The invention also relates to a PrV mutant containing a heterologous gene encoding an antigen of a porcine pathogen incorporated into said nucleic acid sequence. Such a PrV mutant can be applied as a vector vaccine to induce an immune response after infection of an appropriate host animal. Next the PrV mutant is suitable for distinguishing between animals infected by the vaccine virus and animals infected by naturally-occurring viruses.

<DESCRIPTION>
Pseudorabies virus vaccineThe present invention is concerned with a pseudorabies virus (PrV) mutant, a recombinant DNA molecule comprising PrV DNA, a host cell transformed with said recombinant DNA molecule, a cell culture infected with the mutant, a vaccine derived from the PrV mutant as well as a method to distinguish whether an animal has been vaccinated or is infected with naturally-occurring Pseudorabies virus.Pseudorabies virus is a member of the herpes virus group. It is the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease which induces serious economic losses especially among piglets in swine breeding farms and leads to latent infection in older animals. The predominant visible feature of PrV infection is intense pruritus generally resulting in host mutilation of the involved area. Violent excitement, fits and paralysis, all symptoms of encephalomyelitis, precede death which usually occurs within a few days following onset of clinical signs.The research and development trend among traditional vaccine manufacturers has generally emphasized research leading to vaccines that are based upon virus subunits rather than live viruses. This departure from modified live virus vaccines is partly due to the recognized safety of such subunit vaccines because their unlikelihood to contain infectious live viruses. Another reason for developing a subunit vaccine has been to allow for the development of a diagnostic test that would accompany the vaccine and would differentiate vaccinated from infected animals. 

 Subunit vaccines have also their limitations. They contain a limited number of viral antigens compared to those produced by live viruses. This paucity of antigens produces a weak immune response of short duration in the vaccinated animal. This, however, is partly advantageous because it allows to discern vaccinated animals from infected animals. Vaccination only will stimulate production of antibodies to the limited spectrum of antigens present in the vaccine. By sampling the serum of the animal, it is possible to show that the vaccinated animal has antibodies only to the antigens contained in the vaccine while an animal infected with the wild-type virus would have antibodies against a wider range of antigens.Live modified virus vaccines have the advantage that they comprise more antigens and that thus a stronger immune response can be obtained. The chances are that uncontrolled mutations occur during passaging, resulting in populations of virus particles which are heterogeneous in virulence and immunizing
