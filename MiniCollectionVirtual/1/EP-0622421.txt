<ABSTRACT>
A liquid injection moldable silicone 
composition is provided having improved flow 

characteristics. There is utilized in the liquid 
injection moldable composition, a fumed silica 

aggregate having an average convex perimeter in the 
range of about 0.12 micron to about 0.6 micron which 

is treated in situ with an organosilicon material, 
such as an organosilazane in the presence of a vinyl 

containing organopolysiloxane, and a silicon hydride, 
such as a silane or an organopolysiloxane and an 

effective amount of a platinum group metal 
hydrosilylation catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat
curable platinum catalyzed liquid injection moldable
(LIM) silicone composition having improved flow
characteristics. More particularly, the present
invention relates to the employment of fumed silica
aggregate having an average convex perimeter in the
range of up to 0.6 µm (microns) and the use of such
material in combination with platinum catalyzed heat
curable liquid silicones.Prior to the present invention as shown by
Jeram, U.S. patents 3,884,866 and 3,957,713, high
strength addition cured silicone compositions were
provided which were liquid injection moldable. These
silicone compositions comprise a first vinyl
containing silicone component containing a high
viscosity vinyl end-stopped organopolysiloxane, a low
viscosity vinyl containing organopolysiloxane, filler
and a platinum catalyst. Cure of the vinyl containing
silicone component is effected by mixing with a second
silicon hydride component in the form of a silane or
silicon hydride siloxane. Additional silicone (LIM)
compositions are shown by Lee et al, U.S. patent
4,162,243 and Sweet, U.S. patent 4,427,801. Although elastomers can be made from the
aforedescribed silicone LIM compositions having a
satisfactory strength, elongation and tear, the
employment of fumed silica treated with organo silicon
compounds, such as hexamethyldisilazane often result
in the formation of silicone LIM compositions which do
not have optimum flow characteristics in the uncured
state.As used hereinafter, the expression "flow
rate", "infusion rate", or "application rate" means
the number of grams/min of extrudate flow under
pressure. A typical flow test involves measuring the
time required to force 1-10 grams from a 170g (6 oz.) Semco
of test material through a 3.175 mm (1/8") diameter orifice after
the application of 621 kPa (90 psi) pressure.Improved application rates of liquid
injection moldable silicone compositions can be
obtained when silicone LIM compositions are reinforced
with hydrophobic silicon dioxide prepared by the
method of Kratel et al, U.S. patent 3,953,487. In
Kratel et al, hydrophobic silicon dioxide is made by
treating silicon dioxide having a surface area of 50
m2/g to 600 m2/g with an organosilicon compound, such
as trimethylethoxysilane in water, while
simultaneously subjecting the resulting treated filler
to ball milling. A treated silicon dioxide product is
obtained which has a reduced average convex perimeter
as compared to commercially available silicon dioxide,
such as fumed silica. The term
