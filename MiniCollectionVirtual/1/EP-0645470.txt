<ABSTRACT>
A method for sequentially depositing a silicon oxide based film as 
a barrier on a substrate. The film is useful for providing an effective 

barrier against gas permeability in containers and for extending shelf-life 
of containers, especially plastic evacuated blood collection devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for depositing a barrier coating 
to plastic containers for improving the effective barrier of the plastic 
container against gas and water permeability. In numerous fields of technology, it is necessary to apply very thin 
coatings of pure substances to certain objects. An example is window 
glass which is provided with a thin coating of metal oxide in order to 
filter certain wavelength ranges out of sunlight. In semi-conductor 
technology, thin coatings of one or more substances are often applied to 
a substrate. It is especially important that the thin coatings not only be 
pure, but also that they be precisely measured out so that the coating 
thickness and, in the case of coatings of chemical compounds, their 
composition will be accurately repeatable. These coating thicknesses 
are, as a rule, between two and several thousands of nanometers. A variety of methods are known for applying thin coatings to films, 
glass and other substrates. Such processes for depositing SiOx onto 
plastic objects are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,053,244 and 
5,107,791 and European Patent No. 0 299 754. Most specifically, these 
processes can provide excellent barrier properties to plastic films which 
have not been exposed to dust. However, these processes provide only 
minor barrier properties to three-dimensional plastic objects or films  
 
that are exposed to dust. It is believed that the inability to obtain a good barrier on three-dimensional 
plastic objects is due to the lack of cleanliness of the 
object's surface since most three dimension objects are exposed to dust 
during fabrication. In the process of depositing SiOx on thin films, the SiOx barrier 
coating is applied under vacuum conditions to a clean film. Typically, 
film is extruded under very clean conditions and immediately wound 
into a large roll. As a consequence, the film surfaces, with the exception 
of the outside layer, are never exposed to particles in air such as dust. It is believed that the reason for the lack or minimum 
improvement in permeability of three-dimensional objects coated with 
SiOx is that the surface of the three-dimensional object has a 
contaminated surface. It is further believed that the contamination is 
due to foreign surface particles that settle on the object due to its 
exposure to air. Even though SiOx is evenly deposited on the surface of an object 
at about 500 to 1000 Å in thickness, because foreign surface particles, 
that are on the order of 5000 to 50000 Å in diameter,
