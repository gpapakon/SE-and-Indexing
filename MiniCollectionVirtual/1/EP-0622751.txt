<ABSTRACT>
A data processing system and method are disclosed for selecting 
which one of several character recognition programs should be 

used to optimize the accuracy in recognizing characters in a 
field in an image of a document form. Consideration is taken of 

the character form and field type for particular characters and 
an optimized selection is performed on a realtime basis among 

the several candidate character recognition programs which could 
be applied. The resulting character recognition operation has 

its accuracy maximized for reading a wide variety of character 
forms and field types in recognition of preprinted forms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing
systems and more particularly relates to character recognition
of images of text.This patent application is related to the U. S.
patent US-A-5 140 650
entitled "A Computer Implemented Method for Automatic
Extraction of Data From Printed Forms," by R. G. Casey, et al.,
the patent being assigned to the IBM Corporation. The character recognition of images of text is a technology
which has been expensively developed in the data processing
area. There are many commercially available character
recognition computer programs and devices which take an image of
alphanumeric text and convert it to a string of alphanumeric
coded data characters. Each commercially available character
recognition product is usually characterized by its manufacturer
as having certain strengths for which is more appropriately
suited. Some character recognition programs are excellent at
converting images of machine impact printing into coded data
character strings, however, fail at converting dot matrix
characters. Other character recognition programs are designed
for converting handprinted characters either constrained within
the outline of a rectangular box or unconstrained handprinted
characters, and these particular character recognition programs
fail at other types of character forms. The category of
character forms such as machine impact printing, dot matrix
printing, constrained handprinting or unconstrained handprinting
and the like are considered variations of character forms.
Another category of variation in text for which some character
recognition programs are more accurate than others, is the
category of field types. Field types are for example an all
numeric field, or an all alphabetic field consisting entirely of
uppercase letters, or alternately an all lowercase alphabetic
field, or still another type is a mixed alphabetic field of some
capital letters and some lowercase letters, and the like. Some
character recognition programs are much stronger at accurately
converting numeric fields, than they are at converting
alphabetic or mixed fields of characters. The reason for the
limited ability of character recognition programs to perform
well on a wide variety of character forms and field types, is
that character recognition programs are typically based on a
single or limited number of character recognition algorithms,
such as pattern recognition, neural net, character feature, or
other character recognition algorithms. This limitation in the diversity of character
