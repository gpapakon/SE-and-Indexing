<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The known cordless connections are in each case only suitable for specially provided applications, for example cordless telephones can only be used for telephone connections. It is intended to avoid the additional expenditure and the adverse interaction possible when several devices are operated. 2.2. To expand the cordless telephone so that it can be used in any other applications, at least one mobile section is supplemented to form a cordless telephone line unit (TLU) by means of an additional interface inverse to the network. 2.3. By means of such an interconnection capability, almost all the usual terminal devices such as, for example, telephones, videotex, modem, fax, answering machine, teleswitching and teleaction devices and ancillary devices can be operated directly in a mobile and cordless manner.

<CLAIMS>
Cordless telephone, consisting of a fixed part (1) connected to a telephone
network with interface to the telephone network and with means for wireless

connection (2) as well as consisting of at least one mobile part (3.1 ... 3n) in
wireless connection (2) therewith with means for wireless connection, control

equipment, dialling and voice communication, 
characterized in that

at least one mobile part (3.1 ... 3n) is equipped by means of an additional
network-inverse interface (4) to a cordless telephone line unit (6) for the

connection of any market-customary wire-bound terminal devices (5) and

the network-inverse interface (4) is equipped in such a manner that, through
reproduction of the network from the viewpoint of the terminal device (5) to be

connected, it inversely satisfies, at least in the following parameters, the valid
approval conditions of the telephone network with regard to send and receive

reference equivalent, noise, sidetone reference equivalent as well as the
therefrom derived parameters, with regard to direct-current behaviour, direct-current

resistance in operation, call detection, and with regard to dialling
behaviour with the limit values laid down for the telephone network and/or in

the CCITT/CEPT standards.
Cordless telephone according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

a plurality of mobile parts (3.1 ... 3n) equipped with network-inverse interfaces
(4) are connectable to each other or to the fixed part (1).
Cordless telephone according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

at least one mobile part (3.1 ... 3n) is connected directly to a modem or other
additional device which, as a separate unit, module, plug-in card or slot card,

becomes a cordless modem.
Cordless telephone according to any one of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the fixed part (1) is radio-connected directly to application equipment, a
computer for cordless online operation or to a telephone terminal device (5).
