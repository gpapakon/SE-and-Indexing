<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a procedure and a means for processing liquids, such as for oxidizing, flotating or treating in other desired ways. In the method a liquid to be processed is conducted as an in-flow (A) into a first volume (12). Dispersion liquid and the air/gas/liquid dissolved therein is conducted into said first volume (12) or into a volume in the immediate adjacency therebelow for intermixing the liquid to be processed and the dispersion liquid containing air/gas/liquid. The mixed, processed liquid mixture containing bubbles is made into an upward motion, whereby impurities are accumulated into a suspension surface (28). At least part of the liquid to be processed is conducted as a suction flow (K') into a pump (17). Air/gas/liquid is drawn with the pump (17) as a flow (B) into the suction flow (K'), whereby the air/gas/liquid at a pressure generated by the pump (17) is dissolved in the pump (17) and in the discharge side thereof into the circulation flow (K), reacting possibly with reactable components in the circulation flow (K). At least part of the processed circulation flow (K) is returned with the pump (17) into the liquid to be processed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Procedure and means for processing liquidsThe present invention relates to a procedure for processing liquids, such as for oxidizing, flotating, or processing in other ways, in which procedure(a) a liquid to be processed is conducted as an in-flow into a first volume,(b) a dispersion liquid and air / gas / liquid dissolved therein are conducted into said first volume or into a volume in the immediate adjacency therebelow for intermixing the liquid to be processed and the air / gas / liquid containing dispersion liquid, and(c) the mixed, processed liquid mixture containing bubbles is made into an upward motion, whereby the impurities are rapidly accumulated into a suspen¬ sion surface.The invention also relates to a means for treating, such as for oxidizing, flotating, or processing in some other desired way liquids, with which means(a) a liquid to be processed is conducted as an in-flow into a first volume,(b) a dispersion liquid and air / gas / liquid dissolved therein are conducted into said first volume or into a volume in the immediate adjacency therebelow for intermixing the liquid to be processed and the air / gas / liquid containing dispersion Hquid, and(c) the mixed, treated liquid mixture containing bubbles is made into an upward motion, whereby the impurities are accumulated into a suspension surface.In a variety of industrial applications, endeavours have been made to process 

liquids chemically, to carry out chemical reactions, to circulate a liquid solution, to flotate solid components out of a liquid, to mix gases in a liquid into a homo¬ geneous mixture, and/or mix liquids with a liquid into a homogeneous mixture, as well as to carry out the above reactions at desired pressures.Processing several liquids is, however, difficult and sometimes even impossible because in ordinary conditions, i.e. at a standard pressure they cannot be made to mix. One of such waste solutions is e.g. emulgated oil in water. Highly fine oil in an alkaline solution is near-impossible to separate without lowering the pH of the solution e.g. below 5. Hereby, the entire liquid mixture cannot usually be used any longer for the original purpose. As an example can be mentioned car washing liquid or water, into which oils are dissolved into an emulsion. Air can¬ not be mixed in such water because the air is not sufficiently dissolved therein. On the other hand, gas is known to be dissolved in a liquid directly in compari- son with the pressure. Thus, increasing the pressure in a gas and liquid mixture enables multiple
