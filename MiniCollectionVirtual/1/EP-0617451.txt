<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electron energy filter for electron microscopes and an electron microscope having such a filter. The filter consists of three sector magnets (1, 2, 3), the deflecting field in the first sector magnet (1) being homogeneous and in the two other sector magnets (2, 3) being an inhomogeneous gradient field. To generate the gradient field, the pole shoes of the sector magnets (2, 3) have the shape of a truncated double cone. The first, homogeneous sector magnet (1) is traversed twice by the electron beam. Multipole elements (10, 11, 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9) are arranged in front of, behind, and between the sector magnets (1, 2, 3). The filter has a high dispersion even for electrons of higher energy, while at the same time being of compact construction. All aberrations of the second order and the essential chromatic aberrations of the second stage are corrected by means of the multipole elements.

Imaging electron energy filter which images a first entry 
plane (Be) into a first exit plane (Ba) achromatically and, 

concurrently, a second entry plane (De) into a second exit 
plane (Da) dispersively, with several sector 
magnets (1, 2, 
3) for deflecting the beam, wherby at least a first sector 

magnet (1) provides a homogeneous deflecting field, 
characterized in that at least a second sector magnet (2, 3) 

provides an inhomogeneous deflecting field.
