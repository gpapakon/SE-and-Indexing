<ABSTRACT>
In an optical recording/reproduction apparatus 
having M optical heads which records and reproduces video 

and audio data transferred in a high speed using a head to 
be used as a reference and keeping the rotation of a disk 

in synchronism with inputted or outputted television video 
or audio signals, respective heads have their data delay 

memories corresponding to respective disk rotation waiting 
delay time for their respective installation position 

difference from the reference head. By giving recording-permission 
signals at record-starting addresses for 

respective heads for the input data and by giving the 
reproduction-permission signal 
for respective heads for 
the output data, simultaneous recording and simultaneous 

reproduction on different tracks of a disk can be 
realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recordings and
reproductions to and from an optical disk using a plural
number of optical heads.In the works of editing and sending-out filed
information in broadcasting stations or the likes, chances
of using optical disks are steadily increasing. In those
works using optical disks, there are many advantages such
as a high-speed search that is normally difficult by a
video tape recorder (VTR). Furthermore, in a disk system
in which a plural number of head groups are installed,
those plural number of head groups can independently
access over the disk plane. Thereby it becomes possible
to realize such an operation as to make recordings of
input raw materials simultaneously or successively on
different several regions on a plane of a single optical
disk, or to make simultaneous or successive reproduction
and sending out of data which are already recorded on
different regions on a plane of a single optical disk. In
EP-A-506 447
a plural number of heads are installed to a
single optical disk, and hence a simultaneous multi-input 
requests is acceptable. In this case, however, to accomplish the recording and
reproduction of television video signals it is necessary to keep the
synchronization between the synchronization signal of the video signal and the
rotation phase of an optical disk, hence it becomes necessary to establish a special
devicing to fulfill requests to input and output all the corresponding input signal
by those multiple number of sets of heads.The purpose of the present invention is to provide an improved optical
recording/reproduction apparatus having a plural number of heads.This object is solved by the apparatus of claims 1 and 5.In this apparatus, the disk rotation speed is controlled by adjusting the
phase between a sector synchronization signal and television video signal. The
synchronization signal is reproduced from a reference head, which is one head
selected from a plural number of heads. Recordings are performed by dividing the
video-audio signal data assigning to the plural number of heads. And the
reproducings are made similarly, by combining the divided and recorded signals.
Furthermore, this apparatus can perform a simultaneous or successive
recordings and reproductions of a plural number of different signals by using a
plural number of sets of those head groups.In the optical recording and reproduction apparatus in the presention
invention, in order to record and 
reproduce high transferring rate data which must be
handled when the video-audio
