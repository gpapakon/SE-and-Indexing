<ABSTRACT>
A plastic fiber for the optical transmission of information 
comprising a core and a cladding as basic structural units, 

wherein said cladding is comprised of a copolymer having 70 
to 99.5 mole% of 4-methyl pentene-1 units and 30 to 0.5 

mole% of other α-olefin units having 2 to 24 carbon atoms 
and the refractive index of the core material is higher 

than that of cladding by at least 0.01.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with new plastic fibers for 
optical transmission of information, hereinafter also 
designated as plastic optical transmittable fibers. As 
further details, this refers to plastic optical transmittable 
fibers which are suitable as fibers for the optical 
transmission of information to be used as means of optical 
sensor and optical communications, and excellent in heat 
resistance. In addition, the optical transmission loss and 
the flexibility have been improved. In recent years, optical communication technologies have 
made rapid progress applying optical fibers as an information 
transmitting circuit and is now being practised in 
various industrial fields. The optical fibers for optical transmission are classified 
into two categories, namely, the optical fibers of the 
inorganic glass system such as quartz which has been broadly 
used so far and the optical transmittable fiber made of 
certain forms of plastics. The latter plastic optical fiber 
is strong, easy in handling, and low-priced compared with 
inorganic optical fiber in inorganic glass system.  
 
Therefore, this type of fiber has been actively 
developed as communications between short distances 
and has already been put to practical use. For the plastic optical transmitters fibers, 
thermoplastic resins in transparency are used as 
excellent chemical materials. This fiber forms a 
homocentric configuration to increase the refractive 
index of the core higher than that of the cladding. 
The incident ray emerged at one end is 
transmitted to the other end continuing 
the total reflection at the boundary between the core 
and cladding. As for the core layer of such plastic optical 
transmittable fiber, examples of thermoplastic materials 
are proposed as follows. A polycarbonate, polystyrene, 
polymethyl-methacrylate, copolymer of methyl methacrylate 
and maleic anhydride or styrene; a copolymer of methyl 
methacrylate and isobornyl methacrylate or bornyl 
methacrylate. Judging from the excellency in heat 
resistance and mechanical strength, the polycarbonate 
is preferable. While, for the layer of cladding, when using the 
polycarbonate resin for the layer of core, for example,  
 
polymethyl methacrylate (Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication (Kokai) 210303, 1986), copolymer formed 
from monomer such as methyl methacrylate, maleic 
anhydride, styrene, α-methyl styrene and so forth 
(Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (Kokai) 216105, 
1984), poly-4-methyl pentene-1(Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication
