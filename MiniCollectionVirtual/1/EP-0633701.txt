a comparison between the image blocks in a 

manner known 
per se
; (d) if the result of the 
comparison fulfils a predetermined correspondence 

condition, said memory address is indicated 
to the receiver; and (e) if the predetermined

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the 
compression of a digitally encoded video image in 
connection with transmission, wherein image information 
is encoded as successive image blocks each 
consisting of n x m pixels, and an image block to be 
transmitted is compared with at least one other image 
block to determine the correspondence between them; 
and to a device for the compression of a digitally 
encoded video image in connection with transmission, 
the image information being encoded as successive 
image blocks each consisting of n x m pixels, the 
device comprising means for comparing an image block 
to be transmitted with at least one other image area 
of the same size to determine the correspondence 
between them, and a first memory storing the image 
contents of image blocks. The invention also relates 
to a method for receiving a video signal compressed 
according to the invention, and to a device for receiving 
a compressed video signal. Video compression aims at reducing the number of 
bits required in the transmission and/or storing of a 
digitized image. Predictive video compression utilizes 
a prediction value derived e.g. from previously transmitted 
image material, and only the difference between 
the prediction value and an actual value is encoded. At low bit rates the basic problem of video compression 
is insufficient channel capacity especially 
when there occurs extensive motion in the image (the 
motion, for instance, extends outside the used search 
area), whereby normal motion compensated prediction 
will not be successful. The object of the present invention is to  
 
dispense with the above-mentioned disadvantage and 
provide a solution by means of which a satisfactory 
prediction block can be found from among the previously 
transmitted image material irrespective of the 
extent of the motion. This object is achieved by a 
method and a device according to the invention. The 
method applied in connection with transmission is 
characterized in that (a) at least the first image in 
a video sequence is transmitted as such or as compressed 
to a receiver, (b) image content is subjected 
to classification at the beginning of the video 
sequence to be transmitted by dividing the image into 
blocks having n x m pixels and deriving an identifier 
describing the image content of these blocks and 
storing the image content of the image block in a 
first memory at an address determined by said identifier, 
the storing taking place such that at least 
one image content data item
