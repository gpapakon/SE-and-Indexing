<ABSTRACT>
A cabin (1) of a helicopter is structurally separated from the body (2) of the helicopter, and a spring (6) 
and an actuator (7) are combined with the body (2) of the helicopter to support the cabin. High frequency vibrations 

constituting a high frequency component of revolutions of a rotor, which gives the most uncomfortable ride in the 
helicopter, are absorbed by a soft spring, and resonance of the spring and rotor revolution is actively suppressed by 

the actuator whereby vibrations are removed from the cabin over a wide range of frequency to give a comfortable ride 
in the helicopter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helicopter which
has less noise and vibration in a cabin and is very comfortable
to ride in. More particularly, it relates to a
helicopter having a floating type cabin.So far, various vibration reducing apparatuses for
reducing helicopter's vibration have been developed or used
practically. The biggest source of vibration in the helicopter
cabin is the rotation of a main rotor. The number
of revolutions of the main rotor is usually about 4 to 6
per second. When the rotor blades are adjusted properly
and well balanced, the vibration of this number of revolutions
(called "1/rev" vibration, which means once per full
revolution) by itself does not give any feeling problem to
the passengers. The biggest problem is the vibration of a
frequency of N/rev, the vibration of the number of revolutions
1/rev multiplied by the number of rotor blades N,
which is herein called "high-frequency vibration". Since 
the number of blades is usually four (N = 4), N/rev is 15
to 20 Hz. Therefore, when the vibration of helicopter is
to be reduced, the vibration of a frequency N/rev of 15 to
20 Hz must mainly be reduced. The vibration level of the
vibration frequency N/rev in a conventional helicopter,
which is not equipped with any vibration reducing apparatus,
is about 0.5 G (G is the unit of vibration acceleration).
This vibration level apparently makes the riders
feel uncomfortable; therefore, some measures for reducing
vibration are needed.FIGS. 19A and 19B are a view for illustrating a conventional
vibration reducing apparatus for a helicopter. One of the
main causes of vibration exciting force caused by the
rotation of the main rotor is the in-plane and out-of-plane
vibrations of the blade 51. For this reason, a damping
device using a pendulum is installed near the root of each
blade 51 or on a rotor head 52 to reduce the vibration of
the blade 51. Alternatively, a damping device in which a
spring 55 and a weight 54 have been adjusted in accordance
with the vibration frequency N/rev is installed to the
airframe to reduce the vibration of airframe.However, in the conventional vibration reducing
apparatus for a helicopter, the pendulum 53 or the weight
54 of a considerable weight is needed to achieve a significant
vibration reduction, and such an element also increases 
the air resistance of the helicopter. Beside the aforementioned
apparatuses, various vibration reducing apparatuses
for a helicopter have been developed. However, the
apparatuses which have now been used practically show a
