<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a print head for
printing an image on a print medium when it is mounted
on and driven by a printer apparatus main body, and a
printer apparatus using the same.Figs. 2 to 4 show the arrangements of conventional
print heads. In a print head shown in Fig. 2,
electricity-to-heat converters 2 such as heating
resistors, terminals 17a, and wiring lines 16 for
connecting the terminals 17a and the electricity-to-heat
converters 2 are arranged on a heater board 1a.
In a print head shown in Fig. 3, a diode matrix 18 is
arranged between terminals 17b and wiring lines 16, so
that driving signals from an external circuit can be
received via a smaller number of terminals 17b than the
number of terminals 17a in Fig. 2. In the case of a
print head shown in Fig. 4, a driver 3 is arranged in a
heater board 1c, and the driver 3 and electricity-to-heat
converters 2 are directly connected by wiring
lines 16. Print data for driving the electricity-to-heat
converters 2 to generate heat are input from
terminals 17c to shift registers 20. In this case, the 
number of terminals 17c can be smaller than the numbers
of terminals 17a and 17b on the above-mentioned heater
boards 1a and 1b.Figs. 5 and 6 show the arrangements of printer
apparatuses which adopt such print heads.Fig. 5 is a block diagram showing a connection
between the arrangement of a printer apparatus adopting
the print head shown in Fig. 2 or 3, and a host
computer 30.Referring to Fig. 5, the host computer 30 supplies
print information to an input/output interface (I/F) 8
in a printer apparatus 21. The print information is
supplied to a microprocessor (MPU) 28, and is converted
by the MPU 28 into predetermined print information
under the control of a program stored in a memory (not
shown). The converted print information is supplied to
the heater board 1a or 1b via a driver 27. The driver
27 drives the electricity-to-heat converters 2 of a
head 22 to discharge ink droplets, thereby printing an
image on a print medium. The print head 22 comprises,
e.g., a temperature control heater 24 for increasing
the temperature of the print head 22, a temperature
sensor 25 for detecting the head temperature, and the
like in addition to the heater board 1a or 1b, and is
controlled to improve print quality using the MPU 28
and the driver 27. Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing a connection
between the arrangement of a printer apparatus which
adopts a print head 22 shown in Fig. 4 and the host
computer 30. In the print head 22 shown in Fig. 6, the
heater
