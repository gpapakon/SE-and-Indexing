<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing electrostatic discharge protection for 
SOI technology is described. A diode (24, 18) is 
formed in a 
trench region that extends to the SOI substrate (18). During 

normal processing a dopant opposite the substrate type is 
implanted into the trench. The trench must have gradually 

sloping sidewalls to prevent sidewall masking and provide good 
step coverage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of fabricating electrostatic discharge protection
for semiconductor devices,
formed on
silicon-on-insulator substrates.This size of semiconductor devices has shrunk and circuit
layouts have become more complex. As a result, semiconductor
devices in circuits are more susceptible to burn-out by electrostatic
discharge (ESD) events. Various approaches for
minimizing ESD burn-out have been presented. The known approaches
are based on reverse-biased diodes formed in the
substrate of the semiconductor material. In silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) wafers, however, the devices are electrically
insulated from the substrate by a layer of silicon dioxide.
In thin film SOI wafers, the silicon film is too thin to form
large area vertical diodes. What is needed, is a
method for forming a structure to allow electrostatic
discharge protection for SOI transistors.It is mentioned that EP-A-0490437 discloses a reverse voltage
diode for maximum depletion region under high voltage devices.
Therein, said diode is manufactured in a late stage of IC
processing but before MOSFET gate oxide growth. The formation
of the diode involves a special ion implantation step additional
to the implantation of the silicon-on-insulator layer. JP-A-62005662 discloses (in its English abstract) a drain of a
SOI-MOSFET having Ohmic contact to a N+/P- diode in the
substrate. Said buried diode is formed with its own special
diffusion step and before gate oxide growth.US-A-4889829 shows a process for formation of bulk elements
and SOI elements on the same chip to avoid a double LOCOS
technology.FR-A-2145460 shows a gate of a conventional MOSFET connected
to a lateral Zener diode, both on a sapphire substrate. In a
special case, the Zener diode is placed on an oxide layer
common with the MOSFET gate, on a silicon substrate.The present invention intends to provide a simple and
effective method to produce an ESD protect diode for MOSFET
devices. This is achieved by means of a method according to
Claim 1.In accordance with the present invention, a new photolithography
level is inserted following transistor gate oxide
growth. At this new photolithographic level, the area in which
a diode is to be fabricated is defined. A dry etch tool is
then used to etch a trench through the gate oxide, the silicon
film and the buried oxide of the SOI wafer stopping at the
silicon substrate. During a source/drain doping procedure, the
exposed substrate surface is doped opposite the 
wafer dopant type. Standard processing then continues.It
