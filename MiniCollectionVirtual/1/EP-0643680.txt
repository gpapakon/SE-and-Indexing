<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing tertiary methyl ethers. According to the process the feedstock containing hydrocarbons is fed to a catalytic distillation reactor system, in which the isoolefines, in particular the C4 to C7 isoolefines, of the feed are reacted with methanol in the presence of a cation exchange resin in order to produce tertiary methyl ether products. The reaction product containing the ethers is removed from the distillation system as the bottoms product and, if necessary, it is subjected to an additional treatment for producing a gasoline component. The unreacted methanol is removed as the overhead product of the distillation. According to the invention, the distillate withdrawn mainly contains an azeotrope of C4 hydrocarbons and methanol, the C4 amount of which at least approximately corresponds to the C4 hydrocarbon concentration of the hydrocarbon feed, a substantial amount of the unreacted methanol being removed in the form of said azeotrope. By means of the invention the need for a separate methanol washing unit is eliminated in the apparatus which considerably diminishes apparatus investment costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process in accordance with the preamble of claim 1
for preparing tertiary methyl ether products which are used, in particular, as a
components of motor fuels. The products contain t-amyl-methyl ether and possibly
heavier tertiary methyl ethers.According to the process, the isoolefins, in particular the C5 - C7 isoolefins of the
feedstock are reacted with methanol for preparing the corresponding ethers. These
ethers are removed together with the bottoms product of the distillation-reaction system
and, if necessary, they are further processed in order to prepare a motor fuel
component. Unreacted methanol is removed with the overhead product of the distillation.In order to improve the anti-knocking characteristics of motor fuels without using
organolead compounds, and in order to reduce the concentration of detrimental
components in the exhaust gases, tertiary alkyl ethers are added to the fuels. The
oxygen-containing ether group of these compounds has been found to improve the
combustion process in a favourable way as far as the afore-mentioned aspects are
concerned. Suitable alkyl tert-alkyl ethers are methyl t-buyl ether (MTBE), ethyl t-butyl
ether (ETBE), t-amyl methyl ether (TAME), t-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE) and t-hexyl
methyl ether (THME), just to mention a few examples. These ethers are prepared
by etherification of a monovalent aliphatic alcohol with an isoolefin. The reaction can
be carried out in a fixed bed reactor, in a fluidized bed reactor, in a tubular reactor or
in a catalytic distillation column.In a fixed bed reactor, the feed components are reacted in the presence of a solid
catalyst particles, said catalyst particles being contained in a layer which remains
unmixed, because the liquid flow rates are so low that the catalyst particles do not
separate from each other. They form a so-called fixed bed. On the other hand, in a
fluidized bed reactor, the flow rate of the liquid phase is so high that the catalyst 
particles float separately in the fluidized bed of the reactor.When the etherification is carried out in a catalytic i.e. reactive distillation process, the
catalyst particles can form a fixed or fluidized bed in the column. The particular benefit
which can be obtained by the catalytic distillation process is that the reaction and the
separation of the products take place in the same vessel.US 4647703 discloses a process for preparing an ether product used as a component
of motor fuels, comprising reacting a hydrocarbon mixture with methanol, in the
