<ABSTRACT>
An information playback apparatus provides with 
first and second heads which trace a tape on which tracking 

pilot signals having at least two different frequencies are 
selectively and periodically recorded with a period of at 

least 4 tracks, a pilot detector and identifier for 
identifying the 
kind of tracking pilot signals contained in 
a playback signal of the first head, and a tracking error 

detector for detecting and outputting a tracking error 
signal from tracking pilot signals contained in a playback 

signal of the second head, wherein tracking control is 
performed based on the tracking error signal and the 

identification signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information playback apparatus that plays back
information on pictures, sound, data, and the like.US-A-4 679 099 representing the closest prior art from which the invention
proceeds discloses an information signal reproducing apparatus wherein information
signals are reproduced from a recording medium with a number of tracks. Four
pilots signals having different frequencies from one another are recorded successively
on the tracks along with information signals. A reproducing element only
traces alternate ones of the recording tracks. A generator produces a signal having
a prescribed frequency. A signal processing circuit forms a tracking control signal
for a reproducing element from the prescribed frequency signal obtained from the
generator and the pilot signals reproducing by the reproducing element, and a
control circuit controls the tracking of the reproducing element based on the
tracking control signal. In an information playback apparatus that plays
back information signals recorded as slanted tracks on the
tape of a video tape recorder or the like, helical scanning
is usually performed with rotating heads. In this case, a
tracking control is necessary to control the trace
positions of the heads so that the heads accurately retrace
each track. As a method of the tracking control, a
technique called ATF (Automatic Track Finding) is well
known. For example, two kinds of pilot signals having
different frequencies are multiplexed with a data signal
and recorded on the tracks of the tape.In such an information playback apparatus, when
starting playback, a pull-in operation for tracking control
is required. If the transient response time for completion
of a pull-in is long, the operational responsibility of the 
apparatus becomes deteriorated. In prior information
playback apparatus using pilot signals, two kinds of zero-crossing
points appear in the tracking error detection
characteristics, each having a different polarity from the
other. Tracking control is stable at one kind of these
zero-crossing points, but unstable at the other.
Therefore, if the pull-in operation is started near an
unstable zero-crossing point, it is completed when a stable
zero-crossing point is reached. Therefore, there has been
a problem that time required for completion of a pull-in is
long.Further, in the above example, the playback phase
of the tape is corrected based on track numbers recorded on
the tape, so that the phase of a played-back frame is
synchronized with a reference frame
