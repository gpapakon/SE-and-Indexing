<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (1) for weeding in streets, squares, parks and similar public places which have, in particular, a surface consisting of gravel, sand, broken stones or the like. The device (1) has a device carrier with at least one movable component, on which is mounted at least one tool (60) to be brought into contact with the ground. In order to achieve a high cleaning effect for the device (1), with the ground being damaged only slightly, provision is made for the tool (60) to have a shoe-like base part which, on its front edge pointing in the direction of travel and on its side edges, has cutters, with which it penetrates at least partially into the ground, and for the tool (60) to execute an oscillating movement essentially transverse to the direction of travel. At the same time, the tool (60) can be inclined downwards in the direction of travel. Preferably, the base part (63b) is made essentially plate-shaped and the cutters are formed by edge regions of the base part (63b) which are bent downwards.
