<ABSTRACT>
This invention comprises three types of pesticidal granules containing a principal heat-activated binder (HAB) selected from polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, polyethoxylated fatty acids and alcohols, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers and polyethoxylated alkylphenols. The granules can be in the form of agglomerates, extrudates or pastilles.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEWATER-DISPERSIBLE GRANULAR AGRICULTURAL COMPOSITIONSCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a continuation-in-part of USSN 07/899,405 filed June 16, 1992.This invention relates to new advantageous granular formulations of active pesticides which are easily dispersed or dissolved in water for application by spraying or which may be applied as a granular formulation directly.Formulation of active pesticides as water- dispersible powder compositions which can be readily mixed with water and applied by means of a spraying apparatus to a locus to be protected are generally dusty, and unpleasant to handle. Granular compositions have become very popular in recent years because they are safer and more convenient to handle than wettable powders. World Patent WO 89/00079 discloses an extrusion process to make water-dispersible granules of agricul¬ tural chemicals in which water is added to make an extrudable wet mix. The extrudate is rolled to break the product down to granules and then optionally dried. WO 91/13546 discloses pesticidal, agglomerate-type granules. Several single component heat-activated binders (HAB's) are exemplified but not polyethylene glycols (PEG'S). PEG'S are mentioned as suitable co- binders, but none are specifically disclosed. In addition, PEG alone does not satisfy the requirement specified in WO 91/13546 that the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) of the HAB be 14 to 19.U.S. 5,013,498 teaches the preparation of small pastilles by forcing viscous materials through small apertures in a container into cyclical direct contact 

with a moving surface, for example, a cooled steel conveyor belt.SUMMARY QF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to rapidly disintegrating water-dispersible agricultural granular compositions in the form of pastilles, agglomerates and heat extrudate granules comprising by weight based on the total weight of the composition:1) 0.01-90%, preferably 0.03-80%, and most preferred 5-75% of one or more active ingredients;2) 1-90%, preferably 5-60%, of one or more water- soluble heat-activated binder (HAB) selected from polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 6000 to 10,000; polyethylene oxide; polyethoxylated fatty acids or alcohols; ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers and polyethoxylated alkylphenols; and3) optionally, one or more additives selected from the group consisting of: a) 0-10% anticaking agent (s) b) 0-10% chemical stabilizer(s) c) 0-20% gas generating disintegrant (s) d) 0-10% wicking or swelling disintegrant (s) e) 0-20%

What is claimed is:
1. A water-dispersible agricultural granular composition in the form of pastilles, agglomerates and heat extrudate granules comprising by weight based on the total weight of the composition:
(a) 0.01-90% of one or more active ingredient (s) ;
(b) 1-90% of a water-soluble heat-activated binder selected from one or more of the group consisting of polyethylene glycol molecular weight 6000 to 10,000; polyethylene oxide; polyethoxylated fatty acids and polyethoxylated fatty alcohols; ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers and polyethoxylated alkylphenols; and
(c) optionally additives selected from the group consisting of:
(1) 0-10% anticaking agent (s); (2) 0-10% chemical stabilizer (s) ;
(3) 0-20% gas generating disintegrant (s) ;
(4) 0-10% wicking of swelling disintegrant (s) ;
(5) 0-20% dispersant (s) ; (6) 0-5% wetting agent (s);
(7) 0-80% inert diluent (s); and mixtures thereof; provided that (i) when the amount of active ingredient (s) and water soluble heat-activated binder together are less than 100% then one or more of the additives are required to bring the composition to 100%; (ii) when the granular composition is in the form of agglomerates the heat activated binder is selected from one or more of polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight of 6000 to 10,000, polyethylene oxide, 


and polyethoxylated fatty acids or alcohols; and (iii) when the granular composition is in the form of heat extruded granule the heat activated binder is one or more polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight of 6000 to 10,000.
2. The compositions of Claim 1 wherein the amount of active ingredient (s) is 0.03-80% and the amount of water-soluble heat-activated binder is 5-60%.
3. The compositions of Claim 1 wherein the water- soluble heat-activated binder is polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 6000 to 10,000.
4. The compositions of Claim 2 wherein the water- soluble heat-activated binder is polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 6000 to 10,000. 5. The compositions of Claim 1 wherein the granular composition is in the form of pastilles and the water- soluble heat-activated binder is selected from one or more of polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight between 6000 to 10,000; ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers; polyethoxylated alkylphenols and polyethoxylated fatty acids and alcohols.
6. The compositions of Claim 1 wherein the granular composition is in the form of an agglomerate and the water-soluble heat-activated binder is selected from one or more of polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight between 6000 to 10,000; polyethylene oxide; and polyethoxylated fatty acids and alcohols.
7. A process for preparing a water-dispersible agriculturally suitable granular composition in the form of heat extruded granules comprising by weight based on the total weight of the composition:
(a) 0.01-90% of one or more active ingredient (s) ;
(b) 1-90% of a water-soluble heat-activated binder selected from one or more of the 


 group consisting of polyethylene glycol molecular weight 6000 to 10,000, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers and polyethoxylated alkylphenols; and (c) optionally one or more additives selected from the group consisting of:
(1) 0-10% anticaking agent (s);
(2) 0-10% chemical stabilizer (s) ;
(3) 0-20% gas generating disintegrant (s) ; (4) 0-10% wicking of swelling disintegrant (s) ;
(5) 0-20% dispersant (s) ;
(6) 0-5% wetting agent (s); and
