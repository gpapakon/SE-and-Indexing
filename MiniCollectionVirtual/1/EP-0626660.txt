<ABSTRACT>
This application relates to a document authentication 
concept wherein a transparent tape (34) having encoded text (36) 

thereon is applied to the document (10). The encoded text (36) 
printed on the transparent tape (34) is printed with invisible 

ink so that the message thereon is not visible to the 
unaided eye. Preferably, the ink is visible in the infrared 

range. With such a combination, the authentication medium 
can be applied to a document (10) that has a predetermined format 

so that the tape (34) can be placed over a portion of the text 
and the latter will still be readable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to documents bearing
data, methods of producing documents and methods for
authenticating documents.There are many different types of documents issued by
government agencies that authorize the holder of such
documents to perform authorized tasks or grant rights to
the holder of such a document. Examples of such documents
are driver's licenses, passports, entry access badges,
identification cards and the like. In issuing such
documents, it is desirable to have them of a convenient
size, while including information necessary for
identifying the holder and the rights conferred. With
these two requirements, documents issued by government
agencies not only will have a defined format, but the
textual information printed thereon is dense, thereby
leaving little or no room for any additional information
to be printed thereon.A problem frequently encountered by government
officials is the forging of government issued documents.
With the advent of computers and refined printers that are
available at a relatively low cost, the incidence of
forgery has proliferated. Although there are processes
where coatings are applied to documents to prevent
copying, this does not end the problem of forgery.
Various schemes have been proposed to provide security to
government issued documents so as to inhibit forgeries of
such documents. One such scheme is to use encryption so
that a code can be derived that is based upon the
information on the face of the government issued document. Unfortunately, because of the limited space normally
available in such documents, such a scheme has proven
unattainable. Clearly, it would be advantageous to
provide a scheme for imparting security to a government
issued document that would overcome the inhibitions caused
by the predetermined size and defined format of such
documents. Also, it would be advantageous to be able to
carry hidden encrypted information and information
determining authenticity of the document.US-A-4 257 677 describes a retroviewer for viewing an
article to which is affixed a retro-reflective transparent
film material having a first legend-bearing area
comprising microscopic beads and a second background area.Although transparent under normal diffused lighting,
when viewed under collimated light, the first and second
areas have differing reflectances and become clearly
distinguishable to a human observer.DE-C-4 022 822 describes a document on which visible
text is printed on a first layer, and a coded version of
the text is printed on an

<CLAIMS>
A document having provision for determining
authentication thereof, comprising:


a) a plurality of sheets laminated to one another,
b) a first of said sheets having human visual text
printed thereon,
c) a second of said sheets being transparent and
attached to the first sheet, an
d
d) a machine-readable code (36) containing
information derived from the visual text printed upon said

transparent sheet with invisible ink.
The document of claim 1 wherein said machine readable
code printed upon said transparent sheet has

correspondence to at least a portion of the text printed
on said first sheet.
The document of claim 1 or 2 wherein said code (36)
printed with invisible ink is encoded.
The document of claim 2 wherein said code (36) that
is printed on said sheet has a predetermined form.
The document of claim 4 wherein said document is of a
type issued by a Government agency.
The document of any of claims 1-5 wherein the
document is a driver's licence.
The document of any of claims 1-5 wherein said
document is of a type issued by a business entity. 
The document of claim 1 wherein said code (36)
printed with invisible ink is printed on the side of the

second sheet (34) adjacent to said first sheet.
A method of providing a data bearing document having
provision for authentication thereon, which includes the

steps of:

a) scanning a bar code on a document to derive data
therefrom,
b) printing a bar code containing at least a
portion of the data onto a transparent label with

invisible ink, and
c) applying the thus printed transparent label to
the document.
The method of claim 9 further including the steps of
encoding data derived from scanning the document and

printing the encoded data on the transparent label with
invisible ink.
The method of claim 9 or 10 wherein ink visible in
the infra-red region is applied to the transparent label.
The method of claim 9 or 10 wherein ink visible in
the ultra violet region is applied to the transparent

label.
A method for determining if a document having bar
code data printed with invisible ink on a transparent label thereon is

authentic, comprising the steps of:

a) scanning the printed bar code data with light which is
not in the human visible range;
b) receiving a reflection of the light from the
document; 
c) reading the printed bar code data from the document;
d) displaying the read data; and
e) comparing the read
bar code data on the transparent label with visible data on the document.
The method of claim 13 in which the label has an
encoded message thereon, and further including steps of:

scanning said label, decoding the scanned message, and
displaying the decoded message.
