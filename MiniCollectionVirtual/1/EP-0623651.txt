<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic elastomer compound containing a block copolymer, an additive based on polypropylene and optionally a plasticiser is characterised in that the block copolymer is SEBS or SPBS, in that the additive is a polypropylene random copolymer containing, as comonomer, ethylene or butylene in concentrations of from 2% to 8%, and in that the plasticiser is an oil containing at most 10% of aromatic components, where the compound contains from 0.1 to 1 part of polypropylene random copolymer and from 0.1 to 1 part of plasticiser per part of SEBS or SPBS.

A thermoplastic elastomer compound, containing a 
block copolymer, a polypropylene-based additive, 

and a plasticiser, characterised in that it 
contains only the following components: 


1.
As block copolymer: 1 part SEBS or 1 part 
SPBS 
2.
As additive: 0.1 to 1 part polypropylene 
random copolymer which contains, as 

comonomer, ethylene or butylene in 
concentrations of 2% to 8%. 
3.
As plasticiser: 0.1 to 1 part of an oil 
containing not more than 10% aromatic 

constituents and 
4.
If required, an antistatic having a content 
by weight of 0.1% to 0.5%, 
 
the production of the elastomer compound being 

effected to the exclusion of any chemical crosslinking. 
A compound according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the plasticiser contained therein is an oil 

having naphthenic constituents in a range from 25% 
to 45% and paraffinic constituents in a range from 

55% to 75% and is free of aromatic constituents.  
 
A compound according to claim 2, characterised in 
that it contains as plasticiser paraffinum 

perliquidum to DAB 10. 
Medical articles for the following areas: 
infusion, transfusion, dialysis, enteral 

nutrition, laparoscopy and blood sampling, 
characterised in that they can be produced by 

extrusion or injection moulding from a compound 
according to claims 2 to 3. 
Medical articles according to claim 4, 
characterised in that flexible tubes or flexible 

tube systems are involved.
