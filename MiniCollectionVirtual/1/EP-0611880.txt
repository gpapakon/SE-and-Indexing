<ABSTRACT>
An excess voltage applied to a piezoelectric element 
is detected and controlled to improve durability and 

reliability of the piezoelectric element. 
A fuel injection control device for an internal 
combustion engine in which a power source voltage is boosted 

by a dc-dc converter (1) and the so-boosted output voltage 
is supplied via a first choke coil (Lc) and a first 

thyristor (SCR1) to a piezoelectric element (PZT) for 
charging the piezoelectric element (PZT) for being 

subsequently discharged via a second thyristor (SCR2) and a 
second choke coil (Ld). The fuel injection control device 

includes a positive voltage detection unit (10) for 
detecting the positive voltage at a junction between the 

first choke coil (Lc) and the first thyristor (SCR1) and a 
positive voltage control unit (20) controlled by an output 

signal of the positive voltage detection unit (110) and 
adapted for shorting both ends of the first choke coil (Lc). 

The current through the first thyristor (SCR1) is cut off to 
prevent the excess voltage from being applied to the 

piezoelectric element (PZT).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel injection control 
device for an internal combustion engine. More 
particularly, it relates to a fuel injection control device 
in which a piezoelectric element is employed in a fuel  
 
injection valve for taking advantage of shape changes in the 
piezoelectric element caused by voltage application thereto. It has hitherto been known to use a piezoelectric 
element for a fuel injection valve for controlling the fuel 
injection. For example, the JP Patent KOKAI Publication 
No.64-69756 (1989) discloses means for stabilizing changes 
in capacitance of a piezoelectric element caused by changes 
in temperature. The piezoelectric element is increased in 
capacitance with the rise in temperature. If the 
capacitance is increased, the piezoelectric element is 
deformed to a larger extent for the same applied voltage 
because the deformation in the piezoelectric element is 
proportionate to the amount of the stored electric charge 
which is proportionate to the capacitance value. The above 
cited publication proposes a fuel injection control device 
equipped with means for detecting the change in temperature 
of the piezoelectric element and accordingly controlling the 
voltage applied to the piezoelectric element for controlling 
a displacement of the piezoelectric element. However, there lacks up to now a proposal for 
controlling an excess voltage or a negative voltage applied  
 
to a piezoelectric element employed as a fuel injection 
valve. The piezoelectric element suffers from the drawback 
that it is deteriorated or destroyed under a voltage higher 
than its withstand voltage, and that it is susceptible to 
deterioration due to a polarization when under an excessive 
negative voltage and thereby is lowered in reliability or 
durability.  
 Document EP 0 464 443 discloses a device for driving a piezoelectric 
element, wherein a power condenser for charging the 
piezoelectric element and a first switching means connected 
between the power condenser and the piezoelectric element is 
provided. The piezoelectric element is charged by using a 
high potential at a high voltage side terminal of the power 
condenser. A second switching means is arranged between the 
piezoelectric element and the ground terminal for discharging 
the piezoelectric element to the ground via a first discharging 
coil, whereas a third switching means is connected 
between the piezoelectric element and the high voltage side 
of the power condenser for discharging the piezoelectric element 
to the
