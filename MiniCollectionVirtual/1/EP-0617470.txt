<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor light emitting 
device and methods of manufacturing it, and more precisely to a 
semiconductor light emitting device which gives a pure green 
light emission at a higt brightness and methods of manufacturing 
it. Semiconductor light emitting devices, such as light emitting 
diodes, are obtained by growing a plurality of semiconductor 
layers on the front surface of a semiconductor substrate to 
fabricate a multi-layer semiconductor structure with a p-n junction(s) 
and then cutting it into an element(s). Among them, 
green light emitting semiconductor devices are obtained by 
forming one or more layers of both n-type and p-type GaP one 
after another on an n-type GaP single crystal substrate and 
cutting it into elements for practical use. However, since GaP has an indirect transition-type band 
structure, the light emission efficiency is not sufficient if the 
p-n junction(s) is just formed, resulting in a light emitting 
device with a very low brightness. Because of this, the 
incorporation of isoelectronic traps which function as light 
emitting centers is performed as an effective means to improve 
the light emitting efficiency. For example, nitrogen (N) is  
 
doped to the GaP layer(s) near the p-n junction to substitute P 
sites in order to improve the light emitting efficiency. A 
GaP-type light emitting device thus doped with nitrogen emits a 
yellowish-green light with a peak wavelength of approximately 567 
nm. Research of GaP semiconductor light emitting devices has a 
long history, and the light emitting efficiency of the GaP 
semiconductor light emitting devices has been improved to the 
limit of the material property. However, it has been a problem 
that a sufficient light emitting efficiency could not be achieved 
because, as mentioned above, GaP essentially had an indirect 
transition-type band structure. Although the nitrogen doped 
GaP-type light emitting devices improved the light emitting 
efficiency, since the energy level of nitrogen was formed within 
the GaP band gap, it has been a problem that the light emitting 
wavelength became longer and the color changed to yellowish-green, 
and thus a pure green light could not be obtained. Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a 
semiconductor light emitting device which gives a pure green 
light emission with a high-brightness, and methods of manufacturing 
it. In this invention, in order to achieve the object described 
above, an epitaxial layer(s) of compound semiconductor alloy
