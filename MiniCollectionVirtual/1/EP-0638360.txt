<ABSTRACT>
Alkanes are catalytically oxidized using heteropolyacids 
(HPAs) or polyoxoanions (POAs) deposited on a graphite 

surface. The HPAs and POAs are framework-substituted with a 
different metal in place of a metal-oxygen unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oxidation of alkanes with 
heteropolyacids (HPAs) or polyoxoanions (POAs) supported on a 
graphite surface. The HPAs and POAs are deposited on the 
graphite in ordered arrays. The use of HPAs and POAs for the catalytic oxidation of 
alkanes in air and in liquid phase is known. See, for 
example, Ai, "Partial Oxidation of n-3utane with Heteropoly 
Compound-based Catalysts", Proceedings of the 8th 
International Congress on Catalysis, Berlin, 1984, Verlag 
Chemie, 5, 475; Lyons et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,803,187; 
Lyons, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,859,798; Ellis et al., U.S. 
Patent No. 4,898,989; Ellis et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,091,354; 
Lyons et al., Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, 67, 
99-116 (1991). HPAs and POAs and their preparation are described in Pope 
et al., Heteropoly and Isopoly Oxo-metalates, Springer-Verlag, 
New York (1983). In order to clarify terminology used in the 
art, consider first a specific precursor of the compositions 
used in the present invention: H₃PW₁₂O₄₀. Since the cations in  
 
this material are hydrogen, the compound is referred to as a 
heteropolyacid. If the cations are not hydrogen, but are 
metals such as an alkali metal, potassium, sodium or lithium, 
or are ammonium, as in K₃PW₁₂O₄₀ or (NH₄)₃PW₁₂O₄₀, then it is no 
longer an acid, and is referred to as a polyoxoanion. As described in Pope et al., HPAs and POAs are cage-like 
structures with a primary, generally centrally located atom(s) 
surrounded by the cage framework which contains a plurality of 
other metal atoms, the same or different, bonded to oxygen 
atoms. Since the central metal atom is different from the 
other atoms, it is described as "hetero". The other metal 
atoms are transition metals and have oxygen bonding such as: 
As disclosed in Lyons et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,859,798, 
conventional HPAs and POAs may be promoted by the substitution 
of certain metals in the framework of the HPA or POA with 
certain other metal atoms. Ellis et al., U.S. Patent No.  
 
4,898,989, discloses a type of framework substitution wherein 
three metal atoms in a single triangular face in the HPA/POA 
framework are replaced with three different metal atoms, 
thereby enhancing catalytic activity. A limited set of HPA and POA deposited in ordered arrays 
on graphite have been characterized. Watson, et al., Scanning 
Tunneling Microscopy and Tunneling Spectroscopy of Ordered 
Hetero- and Isopolyanion Arrays on Graphite, Langmuir, 8, 
1145-1148 (1992), discloses the physical structure of
