plates (11, 12) and resonance type printed patch radiators (18) 

provided in corresponding relation to openings (15) formed 
through one of the pair of metal or metallized plastic plates 

(11, 12), whereby the antenna can be reduced in thickness,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to circular planar 
array antennas and, more particularly, to a planar type 
microwave antenna for use in receiving, for example, a 
satellite broadcast, and so on. In a suspended line feed type planar antenna in which a 
substrate is sandwiched between metal or metallized plastic 
plates having a number of openings forming parts of 
radiation elements, a circular polarized wave planar array 
antenna has been proposed. In this previously proposed 
antenna, a pair of resonance probes which are perpendicular 
to each other, the number of which corresponds to the number 
of openings, are formed on a common plane and signals fed to 
the pair of resonance probes are mixed in phase within the 
suspended line (see our co-pending U.S. Patent Appilication Serial No. 888,117 filed 
on July 22, 1986 and the European Patent Application EP-A-0 253 128 which is a 
document according to Article 54(3) EPC and corresponds to U.S. Patent Application 
Serial No. 58,286 filed on June 4, 1987). An antenna according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from FRA-2 552 273 which 
describes a suspended line feed type antenna with a solid top and a solid bottom plate of 
relatively great thickness, respectively. Integrally formed protrusions extending from 
the respective plates to the substrate of the antenna are used for forming the cavity 
channel of the feeding means and are also of solid material. Thus manufactoring of the 
antenna is complicated and expensive and not suitable for mass production.  
 Thus, the above-mentioned planar antenna can be reduced 
in thickness as compared with the existing one, and also its 
mechanical configuration can be simplified. Further, an 
inexpensive substrate now available on the market can be 
employed for high frequency use, achieving antenna gain 
equal to or greater than that of a planar antenna using an 
expensive microstrip line substrate. The suspended line achieves such advantages in that it 
forms a low loss line as a circuit for feeding the planar 
antenna, and also in that it can be formed on an inexpensive 
film shaped substrate, and so on. Further, since this 
conventional planar antenna utilizes a circular or 
rectangular waveguide opening element as a radiation 
element, it is possible to construct an array antenna which 
has a small gain deviation over a relatively wide frequency 
range. Meanwhile, a patch type microstrip line antenna element 
is proposed, in order to reduce the thickness of the planar 
array antenna. Figs. 1A and 1B,
