<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
integrated temperature measuring unit employing
thermocouples, and an associated measuring system.It is known that for measuring relatively
high temperatures on the order of hundreds of degrees,
up to 1000-1200Â°C, thermocouples are widely employed as
fairly accurate sensors of low cost having a relatively
prompt response and minimal space requirements.Despite such advantages, the measurement of
temperatures by means of thermocouples is still beset
with some drawbacks and limitations; work hardening,
ageing, and oxidation alter their thermoelectric
characteristics over time. In addition, thermoelectric
joints for reference to a controlled temperature and
connections between the measuring element and the
reference element using compensated cables are
required.
Such limitations are known from measuring systems such as those revealed by PERUCCA:DIZIONARIO DI INGEGNERIA, Vol. VIII, pages 980-983, paragraphs F1=5-1 to F1=5-7 (UTET-TORINO-1978)As a result, recalibration must be performed
at frequent intervals, which involves removal of the
sensing element from the system, and in most cases,
shutting down the whole system.These drawbacks are eliminated by the
integrated temperature measuring unit employing
thermocouples, and associated measuring system according to the claims, which 
form the subject-matter of the present invention,
wherein plural, preferably three, thermocouples are
preferably subjected to a preliminary normalizing and
ageing treatment, are housed within a common protective
sheath made preferably of stainless steel, and are
connected, through the protective sheath, directly to
corresponding reference joints housed in a well formed
in an equalizer block of high thermal conductivity
which is suitably isolated thermally from the ambience
and also houses a precision thermal resistor for
measuring the temperature of the reference joints.The terminals of the different thermocouple
and thermal resistor circuits are connected to the
terminals of a connector for connection to meters by
commonplace leads of copper.According to an embodiment of the present
invention, the thermocouples consist of N-type
elements, owing their name to that they are made of
NiCrSi-NiSi alloy having a high content of nickel, each
housed within an integral sheath of NiCrSi, in turn
protected by the stainless steel sheath, thereby
effectively providing double protection for the sensors
against ambient agents, which makes for extremely slow
ageing processes to be further attenuated when the
