<ABSTRACT>
Insertion system for an air-jet loom, with at least one main blowing nozzle (2, 3) and with means for supplying compressed air to the main blowing nozzles, which contains stationary elements (18, 19) and elements (20, 21) moving together with the main blowing nozzle, the said elements being connected by means of a pressure conduit (22, 23). The stationary elements are arranged in such a way that the outlet (18, 19) of these stationary elements is located above the inlet (20, 21) of the elements moving together with the main blowing nozzle (2, 3) and, moreover, approximately centrally in relation to their end positions (38, 39; 40, 41).

A weft system (1) for an air weaving machine with at least one main blower jet (2, 
3) disposed on a sley (4) and with means (24, 25, 26, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21) for 

feeding compressed air to the said main blower jet (2, 3) and which contain 
stationary elements (24, 25, 26, 13, 14, 18, 19) and elements (20, 21) which move 

together with the main blower jet (2, 3), whereby between an outlet (18, 19) of 
the stationary elements and an inlet (20, 21) ofthe elements which move together 

with the main blower jet there is a flexible pressure line (22, 23), characterised in 
that the stationary elements are so disposed above the main blower jet (2, 3) that 

the outlet (18, 19) of the stationary elements is disposed substantially above the 
inlet (20, 21) of the elements which move together with the main blower jet, the 

stationary elements (18, 19) being substantially central between two extreme 
positions (38, 39; 40, 41) between which the elements (20, 21) which move 

together with the main blower jet (2, 3) move, so that during operation the 
pressure lines (22, 23) move towards both sides in respect of the stationary 

elements (18, 19). 
A weft system according to claim 1, characterised in that the stationary elements 
(18, 19) are disposed substantially centrally between two extreme positions (38, 

39; 40, 41) between which the element (20, 21) which move together with the 
main blower jet (2, 3) move. 
A weft system according to claim 2, characterised in that the stationary elements 
(18, 19) are disposed on a bisector (42, 43) of an angle defined by the extreme 

positions (38, 39, 40, 41) of the elements (20, 21) which move together with the 
main blower jet (2, 3).  

 
A weft system according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
stationary elements (13, 14, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26) of the means of feeding 

compressed air to the main blower jet (2, 3) are disposed on a machine frame 
member (29) which extends parallel with the sley axis (5). 
A weft system according to claim 4, characterised in that the stationary elements 
(13, 14, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26) are fixed on the member by means of a fixing 

arrangement (28, 30, 31) which allows a longitudinal displacement in the direction 
of the member (29). 
A weft system according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
stationary elements for feeding compressed air to the main blower jet (2, 3) 

contain a pressure storage means (24) accommodated in a holder (17) by means 
of which the stationary elements are mounted on the member (29). 
A weft system according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
stationary elements contain a switchable valve (13, 14) the output (18, 19) of 

which is connected by the pressure line (22, 23) to the input (20, 21) of the main 
blower jet (2, 3). 
A weft system according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the elements 

which move jointly with the main blower jet (2, 3) contain a switchable valve the 
input of which is connected to the output of a stationary pressure storage means. 
A weft system according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
stationary elements are so disposed on the member (29) that their output (18, 19) 

is, in the axial direction of the sley (4), offset in relation to the input (20, 21) of 
the elements which move jointly with the main blower jet (2, 3).  

 
A weft system according to claim 9, characterised in that the pressure line (22, 23) 
comprises a portion (51, 52) extending substantially radially in respect of the sley 

axis (5) and a portion (49, 50) extending substantially parallel with the sley axis. 
A weft system according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that two main 
blower jets (2, 3) are so mounted on the sley (4) that the inputs (20, 21) of the 

elements which move jointly with the main blower jets lie at least approximately 
in a common radial surface (44) and in that the stationary elements (13, 18, 25) 

of the means of feeding compressed air to one main blower jet (2) are mounted on 
one side of this radial surface (44) and the stationary elements (14, 19, 26) for 

feeding compressed air to the other main blower jet (3) are disposed on the other 
side of this radial surface (44), on the member (29).
