<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video signal processing and
picture display techniques in a display system such as television
or the like, and particularly to a color display unit in which
the quality (contrast ratio and color reproductivity) of a
picture color-displayed on a plasma display panel is improved.Recently, a plasma display panel is used for a display unit.
This plasma display panel is designed so as to have two groups of
linear or plane electrodes perpendicularly intersecting each
other on two glass plates opposite to each other, and a voltage
is applied across only a pair of specified ones of the electrodes
of the respective groups so as to produce plasma at an
intersection of the specified electrodes to thereby form a
picture element of dot matrix display. Of various flat display
means, a plasma display panel is superior in realizing a large
screen and is capable of performing full color display or high-speed
gradation display. Accordingly, a plasma display panel is
coming into practical use for a thin-type large-screen color
display unit (for example, a display unit for a wall-mounted
television set).However, now a cathode-ray tube (hereinafter abbreviated to
"CRT") is mainly used for a color display unit. Such a CRT has a
display characteristic in which there is a relationship that when
an input signal level and an output signal level (output
luminance level) are represented by x and y respectively, y is
proportional to the γ (gamma)th power of x. Since the value of
this gamma ( γ ) is substantially equal to 2.2 as shown in Fig. 4, 
an original signal obtained by a camera or the like on an
transmission side is corrected so as to have a reversed
characteristic in which γ = 0.45.On the other hand, in a plasma display panel in which half
tone display is performed by pulse number modulation, the value
of gamma ( γ ) is equal to "1" theoretically. That is, generally,
a plasma display panel is only in either one of a turned-on state
and a turned-off state, and half tone display is controlled by
the number of times of turn-on of the plasma display panel in a
short period (in one field period). That is, since the number of
light emissions of a plasma display panel is proportional to the
number of pulses supplied to the plasma display panel, the plasma
display panel is subjected to the pulse number modulation with
the number of pulses of the input video signal to thereby perform
half tone display. Accordingly, if it is intended to perform
display equivalent to that of a CRT, it is necessary to
