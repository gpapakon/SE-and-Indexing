<ABSTRACT>
The inner and outer overlap portions (11a,110a;11b,110b) of the clamp 
band (11,110) made of metal strip material (M) are forced by an 

operating tool to close until the seizing tooth (16a,160a) of the inner 
overlap portion (11a,110a) and the fixed tooth (22b,220b) of the outer 

overlap portion (11b,110b) seize each other, thereby contracting the 
bore diameter of the clamp band (11,110). This state is locked by a prop 

key (23,230) extending from the outer overlap portion (11b,110b) to 
engage the inner overlap portion (11a,110a), while an elastic hump (25) 

for storing the spring force acting circumferentially of the clamp band 
(11,110) is outwardly bulged from the outer overlap portion (11b,110b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in a 
clamping device used for semipermanently fixing a fluid 
conveying hose, dustproof bellows, axial boot or the like 
made of a plastic material, such as rubber or synthetic 
resin, to the connecting circumferential surface of a 
desired mating device. The so-called open type clamping device is known 
wherein a clamp band of metal strip material cut to a fixed 
length is wound into a circular ring with one end 
overlapping the other, whereby said clamp band is three-dimensionalized, 
the bore diameter being then artificially 
forcibly contractively deformed and the opposite ends 
locked together, a rubber hose for conveying various fluids 
is connected to the cylindrical mouthpiece portion of a 
joint pipe, cock or the like. Lobe-formed clamping devices 
called Oetiker are well known in the art. In this clamping device, as suggested from United 
States Patent Nos. 3,082,498; 3,286,314; 3,402,436; 
3,789,463; 4,299,012; and and 4,315,348, the circumferential 
surface of the clamp band is formed with one or two bridge 
type lobes integrally projecting therefrom, the arrangement  
 
being such that the lobes are squeezed and crushed by an 
exclusive tool to reduce the bore diameter. In that case, although the clamp band does not develop 
springiness to expand or contract in circumferential 
direction, since said rubber hose to be fixed is usually 
made of a rubber material having a relatively low hardness 
(elasticity) with a Shore hardness of about 60 or less, the 
clamp band closely contacts the rubber hose throughout the 
circumferential surface thereof; thus, the rubber hose or 
the like can be held on a desired mating device in a stable 
tightened state without any danger of deviation or slipping 
off. However, parts to be fixed, such as dustproof bellows 
and axial boots which are blow-molded from thermoplastic 
synthetic resin material have a high hardness, such as a 
Shore hardness of 90 or more, lacking in elasticity itself. 
Thus, such part can hardly be stably and firmly tightened 
on the connecting circumferential surface of a desired 
mating device. Particularly, when it is used for a 
vehicle which is subjected to torques, vibrations and 
shocks, there is a danger of causing deviation and slipping 
off. Even if the clamp band of said lobe-formed clamping 
device is further formed with a number of locking teeth and 
receiving holes besides said lobes to allow the bore 
diameter of the expandable clamp band to be adjustable, 
since the lobes are

<CLAIMS>
A clamping device including a clamp band (11, 110) 
of metal strip material (M) cut to a fixed length (L), said 

clamp band (11, 110) being wound in a circular ring for 
three-dimensionalization such that an inner overlap portion 

(11a, 110a) terminating in one roll-bent end and an outer 
overlap portion (11b, 110b) terminating in the other end 

overlap each other by a fixed amount (X), the bore diameter 
of said clamp band (11, 110) being artificially forcibly 

contractable, thereby clamping a part to be fixed (10), such as 
a fluid conveying hose, dustproof bellows, axial boot or 

the like made of plastic material, such as rubber or 
synthetic resin, on the connecting circumferential surface 

of a desired mating device (26), 
one cut end of the inner overlap portion (11a, 110a) 

alone is notched to form a nose (12, 120) of fixed width 
(W1) smaller than the fixed width (W) of the metal strip 

material (M), said clamping device being 
characterized in that: 


the inner overlap portion (11a, 110a) is formed with a 
prop key receiving hole (14, 140) and a fixed tooth 

receiving hole (15, 150), distributed in the order 
mentioned from the nose (12, 120) toward an intermediate 

portion (11c, 110c) where the clamp band (11, 110) does not 
overlap, and a first operating tool receiving hole (17, 

170) is formed in said intermediate portion (11c, 110c) 
adjacent said fixed tooth receiving hole (15, 150),  

 
the opening edge of said first operating tool receiving 
hole (17, 170) on the side adjacent said fixed tooth 

receiving hole (15, 150) is outwardly bulged to form a 
second convex channel wall (18, 180) for operating tool 

support, 
the opening edge of said fixed tooth receiving hole 
(15, 150) on the side adjacent the prop key receiving hole 

(14, 140) is outwardly bulged to form a first convex 
channel wall (16, 160), and a portion of the middle of said 

first convex channel wall (16, 160) forms a seizing tooth 
(16a, 160a) bulged toward said fixed tooth receiving hole 

(15, 150), 
the outer overlap portion (11b, 110b) is formed with a 
hole (19, 190) for receiving the first convex channel wall 

(16, 160), a second operating tool receiving hole (20, 200) 
juxtaposed with said first operating tool receiving hole 

(17, 170, and a hole (21, 210) for receiving the nose (12, 
120), 
a part of the opening edge of said first convex channel wall 
receiving hole (19, 190) adjacent the other cut end is 

oppositely, inwardly bulged to form a concave channel 
wall (22, 220) opposed to said first convex channel wall 

(16, 160), a portion of the middle of said concave 
channel wall (22, 220) being bulged inwardly toward said 

first convex channel wall receiving hole (19, 190) to form 
a fixed tooth (22b, 220b) adapted to be seized by said 

seizing tooth (16a, 160a),  
 
the other part of the opening edge of the first convex channel wall 
receiving hole (19, 190) on the side opposed to said fixed 

tooth (22b, 220b) is bent to form a prop key (23, 230) 
adapted to be
 received in the prop key receiving hole (14, 
140) through the first convex channel wall receiving hole 

(19, 190), 
the opening edge of the second operating tool receiving 
hole (20, 200) on the other cut end side is outwardly 

bulged to form a third convex channel wall (24, 240) 
opposed to said second convex channel wall (18, 180) for 

operating tool support, 
the clamp band (11, 110) is formed with elastic humps 
(25, 250) outwardly bulged between said second operating 

tool receiving hole (20, 200) and said nose receiving hole 
(21, 210) or between said first convex channel wall 

receiving hole (19, 190) and said nose receiving hole (21, 
210) for storing the spring force acting circumferentially 

of the clamp band (11, 110), 
the arrangement being such that the active teeth (42) 
of a close type operating tool (P) are respectively engaged 

with the second convex channel wall (18, 180) of the first 
operating tool receiving hole (17, 170) in said inner 

overlap portion (11a, 110a) and the third convex channel 
wall (24, 240) of the second operating tool receiving hole 

(20, 200) in said outer overlap portion (11b, 110b) and the 
operating tool (P) is manipulated to close its pair of 

active teeth (42) to forcibly reduce the bore diameter of  
 

said clamp band (11, 110), whereupon the seizing tooth 
(16a, 160a) of the inner overlap portion (11a, 110a) and 

the fixed tooth (22b, 220b) of the outer overlap portion 
(11b, 110b) seize each other, 
and as soon as a force acts to cause disengagement 
between the fixed tooth (22b, 110b) and the seizing tooth 

(16a,160a), the prop key (23, 230) of the outer overlap 
portion (11b, 110b) engages the opening edge of the prop 

key receiving hole (14, 140) in the inner overlap portion 
(11a, 110a).
