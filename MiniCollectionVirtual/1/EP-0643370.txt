<ABSTRACT>
A cash transaction machine performs receiving and/or 
paying transactions of bills by manipulation of a user, 

transfers bills between a receptacle (1) where bills are 
paid in and out and a storage (8, 9) where bills are 

stored, and by using a sterilizing unit (11) for heat-sterilizing 
bills being transferred, detects the 

temperature of the sterilizing unit with a temperature 
detector (20), controls the temperature of the 

sterilizing unit so as to be in a specified temperature 
range, and also controls the processing of transactions 

by, for example, temporarily stopping the transaction 
according to the detected temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cash transaction
machine for depositing and withdrawing by the user's
manipulation, and more particularly to a cash transaction
machine with a function to sterilize or disinfect
bills.A cash transaction machine having a function
to sterilize bills is disclosed in JP-A-3-209595, in
which sterilization methods by heat, ultraviolet rays,
chemicals are revealed. In sterilizing bills by heat
sterilization, a method of heating a bill with heating
means provided on the transport path is effective. Heat
sterilization of bills, such as this, is shown in
JP-A-4-114652. In JP-A-4-114652, there is provided a
heat sterilizing section, which includes a heating
roller containing heating means such as a heater provided
on the transport path, and a heat-resistant belt
wrapping around the heating roller. Bills are moved
between the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt
as they transferred on the transport path, and the bills
are heat-sterilized at the bill-holding section including
the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt.In a heat sterilization process in which the
heating roller and the heat-resistant belt are raised to
a high temperature and while a bill is passed between 
the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt, the bill
is sterilized by heat, the temperature of the bill is at
about room temperature at most before it comes in
between the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt,
and in order to raise the bill at this temperature to a
sterilizable temperature while the bill is placed between
the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt, a
large quantity of heat is required. When bills are
sterilized successively, the heating roller and the
heat-resistant belt are deprived of a considerable
quantity of heat in a short time, so that the temperature
of the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt
fall rapidly. Not only being deprived of heat by the
bills, the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt
themselves are radiating heat. Therefore, for heating
the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt by the
heating means during sterilization, it is necessary to
provide a large capacity heat source to supply a quantity
of heat equivalent to the deprived quantity of heat.
However, it is difficult to install a large capacity
heat source for reasons of power consumption, installation
space, or the like. An important problem is how to
maintain the heating roller and the heat-resistant belt
at a sterilizing temperature.By the examination of the germs on the circulating
bills,

<CLAIMS>
A cash transaction machine for performing
receiving transactions and/or paying transactions of

bills by a user's manipulation, comprising:

a receptacle (1) for depositing and withdrawing
bills;
storing means (8, 9) for storing said bills;
transport means (2, 4, 6, 7) for transferring
said bills between said receptacle (1) and said storing

means (8, 9);
sterilizing means (11) for transferring said
bills to and from said transport means, and heat-sterilizing

said bills; characterized by
temperature detecting means (20) for sensing a
temperature of said sterilizing means; and
control means (19) for controlling a bill
heating temperature of said sterilizing means so as to

be in a specified temperature range in response to the
temperature detected by said detecting means, and preventing transfer of said bills to said sterilizing means when the temperature detected by said temperature detecting means (20) is outside said specified temperature range.
A cash transaction machine according to Claim
1, wherein said sterilizing means (11) includes a

heating roller (14), a heating transfer means (21) for
transferring said bills by pressing said bills against

said heating roller for a fixed angle or more, and
heating means (17) for heating said heating roller, and

wherein said control means controls said heating roller
and said heating transfer means so that they rotate even 

when said sterilizing means does not perform sterilization.
A cash transaction machine according to Claim
2, wherein said control means (19) controls said heating

roller and heating transfer means so that they rotate at
low speed even when said sterilizing means (11) does not

perform sterilization.

1-3, wherein said control means (19) limits the number of

bills to be sterilized continuously.
A cash transaction machine according to any one of
claims 2-4, wherein said control means (19) moves said heating

transfer means to a position away from said heating
roller when an abnormality is detected.
