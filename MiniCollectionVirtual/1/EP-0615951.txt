<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved process for the purification 
and concentration of sulfuric acid contained with nitric acid by-products 

and organic components pursuant to the mixed acid nitration of aromatics. 
The improvement residing in the integration of a purification system with a 

concentration system which comprises:
 

   heat exchanging spent sulfuric acid feedstock in indirect heat 
exchange with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid obtained from the 

sulfuric acid concentration system prior to introduction to said 
purification system;

 
   introducing the hot sulfuric acid into an upper portion of a 

purification system comprising a stripping column wherein organic 
contaminants and nitrogen-containing by-products are removed by 

countercurrent contact with superheated steam or hot gases;
 

   removing a contaminant-free sulfuric acid stream from a lower 
portion of said stripping column and introducing said contaminant-free 

sulfuric acid to the first stage of a sulfuric acid 
concentration system comprising a multiple effect vacuum 

concentration system;
 

   establishing a pressure differential between the removal point 
for the contaminant-free sulfuric acid from the stripping column and 

the entry point for the sulfuric acid concentration system comprising 
a multiple effect evaporator system such that the pressure 

differential is sufficient to provide flow from said stripping column 

to the multiple effect evaporator system without external pumps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the purification of spent
sulfuric acid obtained from the manufacture of nitroaromatic compositions
by the mixed acid process and to the concentration thereof for reuse.In the mixed acid nitration of aromatic compounds, such as toluene,
a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid is
contacted with an aromatic compound under reaction conditions such that
nitroaromatic products including mono and dinitrobenzene and mono and
dinitrotoluene are produced. In the mixed acid nitration, water and/or
dilute sulfuric acid are generated as by-products. The bulk aqueous phase
of spent acid is readily separated from the bulk organic phase comprising
nitroaromatic and organic by-products by decantation. Prior to reuse,
residual contamination of the sulfuric acid by nitric acid, nitrous acid,
unreacted aromatic and organic reaction by-products is removed and the
dilute sulfuric acid, as low as 65% by weight, is concentrated to as high
as 95% by weight.In one commercial process for purification and concentration of spent
sulfuric acid, the sulfuric acid is recovered by decantation from the
organic phase, heated and introduced to the top of a packed column for
effecting denitrification. Steam is introduced to a bottom portion of the
sulfuric acid denitrification column and nitric acid and derivatives are
stripped therefrom. The denitrified sulfuric acid is removed from the
bottom portion of the sulfuric acid denitrification column and heat
exchanged against incoming feed to the column prior to storage. Sulfuric
acid after denitrification then is heated and concentrated in a series of
multiple effect evaporators.Representative patents which describe various aspects of purification
and concentration of sulfuric acid obtained as a spent acid from the mixed
acid nitration of aromatic compounds are as follows: U.S. 3,856,673 discloses a process for purifying spent acid obtained
from the nitration of aromatic hydrocarbons with particular emphasis
towards removing organic impurities contained therein. The patent
describes in its prior art section a conventional method for removing
impurities which comprised heating the spent sulfuric acid to its boiling
point and stripping the acid with hot gases such as steam, air or nitrogen.
The improved purification process set forth in the patent resided in
admixing the sulfuric acid stream with an oxidizing agent selected from the
group consisting of ozone, hydrogen peroxide, peroxydisulfates, and
chlorates.U.S. 4,157,381
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the purification and concentration of spent sulfuric acid
obtained from the mixed acid nitration of aromatic compounds wherein organic

contaminants and nitrogen containing by-products contained in the spent
sulfuric acid are removed in a purification system and the resulting

contaminant-free sulfuric acid is concentrated in a sulfuric acid concentration
system, said process comprising:


heat exchanging spent sulfuric acid feedstock in indirect heat exchange
with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid obtained from the sulfuric acid

concentration system prior to introduction to said purification system;
introducing the hot sulfuric acid into an upper portion of a purification
system comprising a stripping column wherein organic contaminants and

nitrogen-containing by-products are removed by countercurrent contact with
superheated steam or hot gases;
removing a contaminant-free sulfuric acid stream from a lower portion
of said stripping column and introducing said contaminant-free sulfuric acid to

the first stage of a sulfuric acid concentration system comprising a multiple
effect vacuum concentration system;
characterized by establishing a pressure differential between the removal
point for the contaminant-free sulfuric acid from the stripping column and the

entry point to the first stage of said sulfuric acid system comprising a multiple
effect evaporator system, the pressure differential being sufficient to provide

flow from said stripping column to the multiple effect evaporator system
without external pumps, a seal loop being established between the stripping

column and concentration system to block steam bypass into the concentration
system, superheated steam and/or heated gases such as air or inert gas being

used to strip from the dilute sulfuric acid organic contaminants and nitrogen 
by-products which are recovered and returned to the mixed acid nitration

process.
The process of claim 1 wherein the pressure differential is
achieved by means selected from the group consisting of an elevation

difference between the stripping column and the multiple effect vacuum
concentration system, vacuum from the multiple effect vacuum concentration

system and elevated operating pressure in the stripping column.
The process of claim 1 wherein flow restriction is provided
between said removal point and said entry point thereby reducing flashing of

sulfuric acid prior to entry to the multiple effect vacuum concentration system.
