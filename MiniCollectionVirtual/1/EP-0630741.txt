<ABSTRACT>
A roller apparatus (23) for use in the drying section of 
an apparatus for producing corrugated board comprises a 

tubular body operative to be received over a metal roller. 
The wall of the tubular body comprises an inner layer (24) of 

relatively hard polyurethane and an outer layer (25) of a 
deformable polyurethane. A spiral winding of yarn (26) is 

wrapped around the inner layer (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller apparatus for 
use in the drying section of apparatus for producing 
corrugated board. Probably the most common form of corrugated board is 
double faced board which comprises a single layer of fluting 
medium with a single sheet of liner provided on the upper and 
lower faces thereof. Other types of corrugated board are well 
known in the art, examples of which include single faced 
board, double walled board and triple walled board. Much of the machinery for making corrugated board 
operates on a "continuous run" principle to optimise space and 
to ensure uniformity of the finished product whilst minimising 
wastage. The process for producing double faced board begins with 
the fluting medium being plasticised by a combination of a 
heated roller and steam showers. It then passes between a 
pair of rollers featuring the flute profile, the corrugations 
are formed and adhesive is applied to the flute tips. At the 
same time the first liner sheet, normally the inner - is drawn 
from a roll, passed through a series of heated rollers and is 
laminated to the fluting by a single facer unit. The 
resultant continuous stream of single faced paper is conveyed 
up into and over a bridge en route to the double backer unit.  
 
At the double backer, adhesive is applied to the exposed flute 
tips and a second web of pre-heated liner is brought into 
contact with the fluting as the two materials pass between a 
heated table and a "blanket" belt conveyor. Here, pressure 
and heat are applied to speed the bonding of the two elements. 
The adhesive applied to the flute tips is generally water-based. 
Steam is generated when the heat is applied. The 
steam ultimately corrodes the metal rollers. The board then passes to a drying section. At the drying 
section the board passes over a series of hot plates. The 
board is urged into contact with the hot plates via an endless 
belt. Metal weight rollers are located on the surface of the 
belt which is remote from the board for urging the belt 
towards the board. Flute crushing can occur at the drying 
section as each of the weight rollers transmits a high point 
load to the flute. The belts at the dryer section are generally not produced 
in endless form, but as a length of material with co-operating 
clips or other materials provided at the ends thereof. These 
clips are used to join the two ends of the belt together so 
as to provide an endless structure. If exposed, a metallic 
seam can result in noisy roll bounce as it passes
