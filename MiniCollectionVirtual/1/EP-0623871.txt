<ABSTRACT>
A system for accessing and performing management operations on file 
windows is disclosed. A control window containing icons representing 

each file in a product or system is linked to the files. Each icon in 
the control window is also capable of projecting a miniature window 

dynamically linked (in terms of content and parameters) to the actual 
file represented by the icon. File management operations, such as moving 

and sizing, performed on either the iconic or miniature window 
representations in the control window are transmitted directly to the 

files and implemented, whether the files' main windows are open or closed 
at the time the operations are performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a window access and management 
system utilizing icons and miniature windows. An icon is a pictorial representation on a computer display screen 
of an object, an action, a property, or some other concept. Icons can be 
displayed within control windows for representing entire programs or 
files in programs, and can be used in direct manipulation operations. 
For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,140,677 - Fleming et al., is directed to a 
"mini-icon". As described therein, dragging a document to a folder's 
mini-icon results in moving or copying that document into the folder. 
Similarly, in U.S. Patent No. 5,072,412 - Henderson, et al., displayed 
objects, such as icons, may be moved to different workspaces to regroup 
their associated files differently. In U.S. Patent No. 5,140,678 - Torres, common user interface 
symbols, such as the title window bar, command bar, and scroll bars are 
replaced by icons. U.S. Patent No. 5,179,655 - Noguchi, et al., addresses the 
situation in which a displayed file window becomes completely hidden by 
other window(s) displayed over top it, by providing for the generation of 
an icon displayed in a superordinate location of the display screen, as a 
conduit to enable the user to re-access the hidden window. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,868,765 - Diefendorff, addresses the same problem somewhat 
differently by providing a porthole that allows the user to view portions 
of windows hidden behind other windows. Another porthole or miniature window concept is described in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,823,303 - Terrasawa, which is directed to providing 
"viewport" windows for a main file window. While one "miniature" 
viewport provides an overview of the file, the other provides a close-up, 
detailed view of a portion of the overview window. Also, in U.S. Patent No. 5,072,412, a window "pictogram" may be 
displayed with the representative icon "pictogram" so that the user can 
obtain more information about the content of the corresponding display 
object without actually viewing the main window for the object.  Finally, U.S. Patent No. 4,974,173 - Stefik, et al., is directed to 
"small-scale representations" or miniature windows that appear on the 
screen simultaneously with the main file window to provide a record of 
changes made in the file data. As is common in the art, user access to icons for performing 
operations in any of the described applications is by input through 
locator input devices, the most common of which is the mouse. It should 
be noted that

<CLAIMS>
A control window container for performing file window management 
operations in a computer system having a display, a locator input device 

associated with the display and a plurality of product windows adapted 
for selective display in a multiple window format, the container 

comprising: 
   means for displaying a plurality of icons, each icon representing a 

separate product window; 
   means for displaying a miniature window in association with each 

displayed icon; and 
   link data means for linking each displayed icon to its 

corresponding product window for transmitting window management 
operations performed by a user through the locator input device, on a 

displayed icon or its associated miniature window, to said displayed 
icon's corresponding product window. 
A control window container, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
miniature window has contents reflecting contents in its corresponding 

product window, and the contents of the miniature window cannot be 
directly manipulated. 
A control window container, as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the link 
data means is bi-directional for transmitting changes effected directly 

in the product window to said control window. 
A control window container, as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the link 
data means further comprises means for refreshing the contents of the 

miniature window corresponding to the product window to display changes 
effected directly in the product window. 
A control window container, as claimed in Claim 1, further 
comprising first indicator means for designating icons corresponding to 

displayed product windows. 
A computer system comprising a control window container as claimed 
in any preceding claim. 
A file window management method in a computer system having a 
display and locator input means associated with the display, comprising 

the computer implemented step of: 
   creating and displaying a control window container; 

   displaying within said container an array of icons, each icon 
representing a separate product window in the computer system; 

   linking said icons with their corresponding product windows for 
transmitting file window management operations from the icons to the 

product windows; 
   in response to user performed operations on icons through the 

locator input means, displaying within said container miniature windows 
for selected icons; and 

   in response to user performed operations on icons or miniature 
windows through the locator input means, transmitting window management 

operations to the corresponding product windows. 
A file window management method, as claimed in Claim 7,wherein the 
step of displaying within said container miniature windows or selected 

icons in response to user performed operations, further comprises: 
   dynamically linking the displayed contents and parameters of said 

miniature windows with corresponding product windows for transmitting 
operations performed directly on said product windows to the 

corresponding miniature windows. 
A file window management method, as claimed in Claim 7, further 
comprising means for highlighting icons in the control window 

corresponding to displayed product windows. 
A file window management method, as claimed in Claim 7, further 
comprising means for highlighting one icon in the control window actively 

transmitting window management operations to a product window.
