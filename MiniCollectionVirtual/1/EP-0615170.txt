<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image-forming 
machine such as a laser beam printer or an 
electrostatic copying machine. More specifically, it 
relates to an image-forming machine comprising a main 
body of the machine and a process unit detachably 
mounted on the main body. It is well known to those skilled in the art 
that particularly in small-sized image-forming 
machines, the type having a process unit detachably 
mounted on the main body of the machine is gaining 
widespread acceptance. The process unit includes a 
rotating drum having a photosensitive member disposed 
on its surface, a developing device and a cleaning 
device. For example, such a machine is disclosed in EP-A-0 314 140. The European publication EP-A-0 368 346 (published on 16.5.90) 
discloses an image-forming machine of the type in which 
the main body is comprised of a lower housing and an 
upper housing mounted on the lower housing so as to be 
free to pivot between an open position and a closed 
position, and a process unit is detachably mounted on 
the lower housing of the main body of the machine. The 
process unit is constructed of a first unit and a 
second unit separably combined with each other. The 
first unit comprises a first frame member, a developing 
device mounted on the frame member so that it is free 
to move over a predetermined range, and an elastic 
biasing means for elastically biasing the developing 
device in a predetermined direction. The second unit 
comprises a second frame member, a rotating drum  
 
mounted rotatably on the second frame member and a 
cleaning device mounted on the second frame member. On 
the other hand, the lower housing of the main body of 
the machine has provided therein a supporting-guiding 
means mounted pivotably between an elevated position 
and a lowered position, a holding means mounted so that 
it is free to pivot between a holding position at which 
it holds the supporting-guiding means at the elevated 
position and a release position at which it permits the 
supporting-guiding means to move to the lowered 
position, and an elastic biasing means for elastically 
biasing the holding means at the holding position. The process unit is mounted on the main body 
of the machine in the following manner. First, the 
upper housing of the main body of the machine is 
pivoted to the open position, and the supporting-guiding 
means is brought to the elevated position. The 
supporting-guiding means is held at the elevated 
position by the holding means which is biased at the 
holding
