<DESCRIPTION>
 "Receiver/Decoder for a Serial Network of I/O Devices"DESCRIPTIONTechnical Field Applicants' invention relates generally to electrical control mechanisms and more particularly to a network of single point input and output devices serially connected to programmable logic controllers or other types o'|f microprocessor based devices that performs a number of control functions.Related ApplicationsThis application is related to the following, commonly assigned applications filed concurrently herewith, entitled " A Synchronous Serial Communication Network For Controlling Single Point I/O Devices" (Serial No. xxx,xxx, Our Docket AP-46) ; "Apparatus For Generating And Sending A Serial Data Packet for Controlling A Network Of Single Point I/O Devices" (Serial No. xxx,xxx, Our Docket AP-47) ; and "Apparatus for Receiving And Modifying A Serial Data Packet From A Communications Network To Indicate Its Status" (Serial No. xxx,xxx, Our Docket AP-49) . The contents of these applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.Background ArtInput and output control modules for interfacing with a programmable logic controller (PLC) that is normally used to control a number of functions in a manufacturing operation are well known. In most instances, these control module assemblies are electrically interconnected in a rack assembly with the PLC. This assembly is often of necessity 

 located on the plant floor at a distance from the machinery used in the manufacturing operation to prevent physical abuse from dirt, moisture, or vibration. Since many of the switches, pilot lights, control relays and so on are located on the machinery, considerable wiring is required to connect these devices to the PLC since each device requires at least two wires between it and its respective - I/O point.Remote I/O control modules are available that can be located in a rack assembly mounted directly on the machinery. Whereas this will reduce the wiring requirements, the additional rack assembly will require adding a power supply and a remote network interface module (NIM) that could be more costly. These assemblies are generally bulky and require mounting space that may not be available. Each device will still require a direct connection to the remote I/O control module.The host PLC will also require a local NIM Communications between the local and remote NIMs can become complicated. Each device has an unique address. There must be a means for each I/O point to know and set its address location so that it can decode and select the

CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A receiver module contained in a microprocessor based device for receiving a serial data packet from a plurality of I/O repeater modules connected in series over a synchronrOus serial communications network, said receiver module comprising: 
~
~ (A) a clock pulse input for synchronizing said receiver with said synchronous serial communications network;
(B) a buffer register coupled to said synchronous serial communications network, said buffer register for storing a part of said received serial data packet from said network;
(C) a first shift register coupled to said buffer register, said first shift register for storing said serial data packet coupled from said buffer register and for converting said serial data packet into parallel and separate data bits, wherein said data bits include a true data bit and a complement data bit from each of said plurality of I/O repeater modules;
(D) a detector for decoding an end byte of said serial data packet to indicate the end of said serial data packet;
(E) a second buffer register having its input coupled to the parallel true data bit outputs of said first shift register and its output coupled to a data bus in said microprocessor based device; 


 (F) a comparator means for comparing each of said true data bits with its said complement data bit, said comparator means for determining if said data bits are valid;
(G) a third buffer register coupled to said comparator means for receiving said valid data- bits, said third buffer register having an output coupled to said data bus
10 in said microprocessor based device; and
(H) wherein said second buffer register transfers said true data bits to said microprocessor based device and said third buffer register transfers said
15 valid data bits to said microprocessor based device .
The receiver module of claim 1 wherein said serial data packet received from said
20 synchronous serial communications network consists of an input sync byte, n number of input bytes, where n is the number of said I/O repeater modules connected on said network, and an output sync byte, .
25
The receiver module of claim 2 wherein said input bytes received by said receiver module represent status bits for input devices that may be connected to said I/O repeater modules
30 wherein each of said I/O repeater modules inserts its respective said status bits after detecting said input sync byte into said serial data packet. 


 4. The receiver module of claim 3 wherein said input bytes are split-phase binary encoded having a first bit equal to the true state of said input device and a second bit equal to the complement of the state of said input device.
5. The receiver module of claim 2 wherein said buffer register coupled to said synchronous ~~ serial communications network transfers said received serial data packet to said first shift register until said detector detects said output sync byte.
6. The microprocessor based device of claim 1 wherein said device is a programmable logic controller.
7. The microprocessor based device of claim 1 wherein said device is a personal computer.
8. The receiver of claim 1 wherein said synchronous serial communications network is a multiconductor wire cable and said second serial data packet is transmitted over said cable.
9. The receiver of claim 1 wherein said synchronous serial communications network is a fiber optic cable and said second serial data packet is transmitted over said cable.
