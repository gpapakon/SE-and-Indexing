<ABSTRACT>
A shorts type disposable diaper comprising an absorptive 
body including a liquid permeable topsheet, a liquid 

impermeable backsheet, and an absorber interposed between 
said topsheet and said backsheet, said absorptive body 

being divided into a stomach side portion, an under-crotch 
portion, and a back side portion, substantially continuous 

elastically expansible members being disposed over entire 
peripheral edge port
ions of a waist opening and a pair of 
leg openings which are formed by fixedly connecting confronting 

opposite side portions between said stomach side 
portion and said back side portion, wherein:

 
   said absorber being 8 mm or less in thickness and 

100 mm or more in width in said under-crotch portion, and 
the distance from a side edge of the under-crotch portion 

of said absorber to said elastically expansible members 
disposed in said leg opening being 15 mm or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shorts type disposable
diaper for the use of infants, incontinent persons and
adults, and more particularly to a shorts type disposable
diaper which is capable of enhancing fitness and improving
leak preventing efficiencyConventional disposable diapers are mostly of the
flat type, in which a flat diaper body is placed against
the wearer and thereafter fastened by a tape fastener
located at a side portion (side surface of the waist
portion). Recently, there has been developed a so-called
shorts type diaper in which side portions thereof are
preliminarily fixedly connected without using any tape
fastener. Various kinds of shorts type diapers of this
type are proposed, including one in which gathers are
provided at a waist portion and leg portions, for example.
(Japanese Laid Open Patent Application Nos. Sho 58-115106,
Sho 58-115107, Sho 62-231005, etc.) These shorts type
diapers can all be worn by the wearer in a standing condition
as in the case with the normal undergarments. They
are intended to be used not only by infants as diapers, 
but also by month-wise aged babies (babies of about eight
to twelve months old) as a toilet training wear, or by
incontinent persons and adults as a diaper.The shorts type disposable diaper has the feature,
compared with the so-called flat type diaper, in the
respect that the wearer can wear it by himself/herself or
with the aid of a helper in such a manner as to pull it up
and down just like when a normal undergarment is worn.
However, there is a demand that such diaper has such
functions as a favorable absorption with respect to a
bodily liquid, fitness enough to prevent leakage of discharged
materials, compliance to various active movements,
wearability, easy-to-wear and easy-to-remove characteristic.In order to fulfill the above demand, Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. Hei 2-4364 discloses a construction
in which a side panel (side member) is disposed
at each side portion for attaching a stomach side portion
and a back side portion of a diaper body, and elastically
expansible members are disposed respectively at end portions
of the stomach side and back side of the diaper
body. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. Hei 3-82467
disclosed a construction in which the elastically
expansible members around a pair of leg portions comprise
first and second members, and central portions of the 
first and second members are disposed generally at a
central portion of an under-crotch portion of the diaper,
thereby fitness is enhanced at
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A shorts type disposable diaper (120) comprising an absorptive
body (110) including a liquid permeable topsheet (101), a liquid

impermeable backsheet (102), and an absorber (103)
interposed between said topsheet and said backsheet, said

absorptive body being divided into a stomach side portion
(111), an under-crotch portion (112), and a back side portion

(113), substantially continuous elastically expandable members

(115) being disposed over entire peripheral edge portions of a
waist opening (121) and a pair of leg openings (122) which are

formed by fixedly connecting confronting opposite side portions
(111a,113a) between said stomach side portion and said back

side portion, said absorber (103) being 8 mm or less in
thickness and 100 mm or more in width in said under-crotch

portion (112), and a distance from a side edge (112a) of the
under-crotch portion (112) of said absorber (103) to said

elastically expandable members (115a,b) disposed in said leg
opening (122) being 15 mm or more, said elastically expandable

members (115a,b) disposed in said leg openings (122) comprise
at least one first and at least one second elastically expandable

members (115,a,b) which are fixedly stretched such that said
expandable members (115a,b) extend respectively, at said

stomach side portion (111) and back side portion (113), along
an inner side of a part of one side edge portion (111a,113a)

and an inner side of one side edge portion (112a) of said under-crotch
portion (112), then across the center of said under-crotch

portion (112) and finally along an inner side of the other side 
edge portion (112a), said first and second elastically

expandable members (115a,b) being in parallel relation to each
other at the center of said under-crotch portion (112), and two

outermost elastic members (115a,b) do not cross at said under-crotch
portion (112).
A shorts type disposable diaper as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the thickness of said absorber (103) at opposite side edge

areas in the longitudinal direction is smaller than the thickness
of said absorber (103) at a central area between said opposite

side edge areas.
A shorts type disposable diaper as claimed in claim 2, wherein
said opposite side edge areas are compressed into thin shapes,

respectively.
A shorts type disposable diaper as claimed in claim 2, wherein
said opposite side edge areas are formed of absorptive paper.
A shorts type disposable diaper as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 4, in which three-dimensional gathers are formed serving

said opposite side edge areas as a fixed point.
A shorts type disposable diaper as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 5, wherein said elastically expandable members (115a,b)

are not fixed at the under-crotch portion (112).
A shorts type diaper as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein said two outermost elastic members (115a,b) in said

under-crotch portion (112) have a distance in the range of 0 to
20mm. 
A shorts type diaper of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein said
first and second elastically expandable members (115a,b) are

stretched in parallel relation at the under-crotch portion (112).
