<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a monoclonal
antibody with a unique binding pattern.Cytotrophoblast are a cell type unique to the
placenta and fetal membranes. In early pregnancy, the
extra-villous cytotrophoblast of the cell columns
infiltrate the maternal decidua lining the uterus and
anchor the placenta [Boyd & Hamilton, 1970], later also
invading the maternal spiral arteries as part of a
process which allows the hugely increased
uteroplacental blood flow required for successful
pregnancy [Pijnenborg et al., 1980]. The villous
cytotrophoblast covering the chorionic villi fuse and
differentiate to form the syncytiotrophoblast which is
the major site of exchange of nutrients and waste
products between the fetus and the maternal
circulation. In the fetal membranes, the extra-villous
trophoblast of the chorion are also in direct contact
with the maternal decidua [Boyd & Hamilton, 1970].Trophoblast are known to be heterogeneous,
both in function and morphology, but the various
trophoblast subsets are poorly defined. Anti-trophoblast
antibodies with different specificities
are useful for characterising these subsets.Another use for anti-trophoblast antibodies
which may be of significant value commercially is
contraception. Monoclonal antibodies could provide a
reliable and convenient new method of contraception
free of side-effects.The present invention provides a monoclonal
antibody, designated antibody X, raised against a
highly purified population of first trimester human 
cytotrophoblast taken from cell islands, small clumps
of extra-villous cytotrophoblast partially covered by
syncytiotrophoblast, which are found mainly in first
trimester tissue.In first trimester tissue, antibody X binds
to cell island and the interstitial trophoblast
invading the maternal decidua. In the second trimester
and at term, the antibody labels a subset of
cytotrophoblast in the amniochorion. Antibody X does
not react with syncytiotrophoblast or villous
cytotrophoblast in first trimester placenta, or with
term syncytiotrophoblast. The antigen detected by
antibody X is specific for cytotrophoblast, and is not
present on amniotic epithelium, decidual cells, or
villous stromal cells in first trimester or at term.
Antibody X does not bind to any normal adult human
tissues tested and is not present on breast or cervical
carcinoma cells. In relation to other anti-trophoblast
antibodies, antibody X defines a unique subset of
extra-villous trophoblast, which in the first
trimester corresponds to the most invasive forms.As part of the
