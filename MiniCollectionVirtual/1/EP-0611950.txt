<ABSTRACT>
In a method according to the invention for compensating for variations in the wavelength of the light source of a fibre-optic gyroscope having closed control resetting circuit, use is made of the discovery that the voltage change which is necessary for a phase shift of 2 pi  in a phase modulator (4) depends on the light-source wavelength. Since the voltage required for the 2 pi  phase shift is regulated, the voltage value thereby provided can, according to the invention, be employed for compensating for a change in the light-source wavelength or in the scale factor, respectively. For accurate compensation, the temperature of the phase modulator (4) should also be taken into consideration.

Process for the compensation of wavelength 
changes of the light source (1) and thus of the wavelength-dependent 

scale factor of a fibre-optic interferometer 
having a closed control loop for measuring a 

rate of rotation, wherein 

two light beams originating from the light 
source (1) and polarized and generated by 

beam splitting are modulated in a phase modulator 
(4) by a signal limited to phase ranges of 2π, are 

then injected in opposite directions into a fibre 
coil (5) and are subsequently recombined, 
the interference pattern produced acts upon a 
photodetector (6), the output signal of which, which 

corresponds to the light intensity of the interference 
pattern, delivers, after analog/digital 

conversion (7) via a digital electronic control 
system (8, 12), a setting signal which, subjected to 

analog/digital conversion, serves for the 
compensation of non-reciprocal phase shifts of the 

light beams at the phase modulator (4), the analog 
voltage of the digital/analog converter (9) converting 

the setting signal being amplified so that the 
maximum phase range in the phase modulator corresponds 

to 2π, 
 
characterized in that 


the change of the wavelength of the light source 
(1) is co
mputed from the effective variable of the 
electronic control system (8), which regulates the 

maximum modulation range at the phase modulator (4) 
to 2π, and the temperature (11) measured at the 

phase modulator (4), and the change of the scale 
factor on account of a wavelength change is arithmetically 

compensated for by the result of this 
computation.
