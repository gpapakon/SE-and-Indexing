The connectors (10, 13) are each mounted rigidly on the board (1) because at least one terminal end (24) of a contact element (16, 18; 17, 19) of a connector (10, 13) is received in a hole (27) of a pattern (26) of holes (27) provided in the board (1), which terminal end (24) is provided with means (25) for the clamping mounting thereof in the respective hole (27). In this manner, connectors (10, 13) can be mounted adjacently on the component board (1) without the loss of position of a contact element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system or connector/board assembly for 
the electrical interconnection of component boards having connectors 
which are positionable essentially straightly opposite to one another on 
both sides of a board, each connector being secured to its board and 
comprising a housing of electrically insulating material provided with a 
plurality of contact elements of electrically conducting material having 
a contact end for making contact to a further contact element and a 
terminal end for connecting electrical wiring, the board being provided 
with a hole pattern comprising one or more rows of holes for receiving 
terminal ends therein. Systems of this type are used in practice, for example, for the 
stack interconnection of component boards or, for example, for the 
connection, on a component board, also referred to as mother board or 
mother panel, of one or more further component boards, also referred to 
as daughter boards or daughter panels, on both sides. These daughter 
boards may per se be provided in turn with connectors on both sides for 
forming a stack of daughter boards or for connecting yet further 
component boards, also referred to as baby boards or baby panels, 
thereto. A system of this type is disclosed, for example, by 
DE-A-3,323,029, use being made, however, of connectors having 
projections situated at the end faces of the housing for mounting the 
respective connector housing on the component board by means of a screw 
or rivet joint. This manner of mounting the housings on the component 
board has the disadvantage that, as a consequence of the projections 
extending laterally from the connector housing for the mounting thereof, 
it is not possible to mount a plurality of connectors adjacently to one 
another without loss of a contact element position on the component 
board. In the English-language literature this is also known as "end-to-end 
stacking". The object of the invention is to provide a system or assembly of 
the type mentioned above, in particular, having end-to-end stackable 
connectors mounted sufficiently rigidly on the respective component 
board.  
 According to the invention this is achieved in that the contact 
elements of a first connector of a pair of oppositely postionable 
connectors are shifted in position with respect to the contact elements 
of the second connector of said pair in row direction, such that at 
least one terminal end of a contact element of the first connector and 
at least one terminal end of a contact element of the
