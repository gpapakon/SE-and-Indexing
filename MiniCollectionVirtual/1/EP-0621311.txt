<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic
polymer composition and, more specifically, to a thermoplastic
polymer composition comprising a thermoplastic polymer
having polarity on the main chain thereof and a modified
block copolymer to which a carboxylic acid group or
derivatives thereof has been added, the composition having
excellent mechanical characteristics with the two components
having improved compatibility.Polymeric substances have been widely used as materials
for fibers, films, sheets and like shaped articles, and it
sometimes happens that these substances, when used alone, do
not sufficiently meet the intended purpose. A variety of
attempts have therefore been made to combine a polymeric
substance with other components to form compositions or
laminates, thereby providing the resulting products with
sufficient strength, improved processability, reduced cost
or like advantages. However, different types of polymeric
substances, when combined together to form a composition,
seldom have good compatibility with each other. As a
result, most of compositions comprising different types of
polymeric substances with poor compatibility have problems
in achieving the intended improvements due to non-uniformity, 
inter-layer delamination between the different
polymer layers or like troubles resulting from the poor
compatibility.It is known, in order to obtain compositions having
good properties by blending different polymeric substances,
to use as one component a block copolymer comprising a
polystyrene block and a polybutadiene block, one comprising
a polystyrene block and a polyisoprene block, or a hydrogenated
block copolymer obtained by partially hydrogenating the
foregoing (for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
Nos. 119055/1975, 148457/1975, 75651/1975, 117940/1977
and 150457/1977). However, these block copolymers cannot be
said to be useful for improving the characteristics of
thermoplastic polymers having polarity on their main chain,
such as polyamides, thermoplastic polyesters and thermoplastic
polyurethanes, because of markedly poor compatibility
with these polymers.There are known compositions capable of modifying
polyamides, thermoplastic polyesters, thermoplastic polyurethanes
and the like, incorporating into these thermoplastic
polymers a block copolymer obtained by permitting a
carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof to add to a partially
hydrogenated product of a block copolymer comprising an
aromatic vinyl compound polymer block and a conjugated diene
compound polymer
