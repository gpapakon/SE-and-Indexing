<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector for connecting an integrated 
circuit (IC) to a receptacle such as a socket includes a base 

module to which is attached an IC module. The base module 
contains, on one surface, pins for insertion into the socket, 

and, on another surface, base pads, which are connected to the 
pins by conductors located inside the base module. A custom 

IC module is then formed on the base module. The base pads 
connect electrically with respective larger pads in the IC 

module to ensure good electrical contact despite size 
variations which may exist in the base module. The IC module 

contains IC pads on an external surface, which connect with 
the base pads by way of internal interconnections constructed 

into the IC module. An integrated circuit (IC) is bonded to 
the IC pads. The base module is formed from a ceramic 

material and the IC module is formed from a polymer material, 
such as polyimide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors of the 
kind for connecting an integrated circuit to a receptacle such 
as a socket. The invention also relates to a method of 
manufacturing such an electrical connector. One type of such an electrical connector is a Multi-Chip 
Module (MCM). Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs) are generally 
constructed from stacks of sheets of thin ceramic material, 
which are termed "green tape ceramic" because of their 
appearance. A simplified sequence of the construction is the 
following: 
Conductive traces are applied to the ceramic 
sheets. The ceramic sheets can be extremely thin 
and delicate. Sheets as thin as 127 microns (5 
mils) are used. Holes are punched in the sheets at proper locations. The holes are filled with a tungsten-based paste, 
which later forms conductive plugs which extend 
through the sheets. The sheets are aligned and stacked, compressed, 
and fired in an oven, which sinters the assembly. 
The firing bonds the sheets together, and fuses 
the tungsten. The fused tungsten forms plugs (or 
"vias") which extend through the sheets, 
connecting the conductive traces. The type of connections formed is shown schematically in 
Figure 1. The TRACES cross over each other, by means of the 
VIAs: pad A connects with pad B, pad C with D, and so on. The 
traces form a 3-dimensional network, which is sometimes termed 
a "non-planar" network. The 3-dimensional network connects 
integrated circuits (not shown) with each other and with other  
 
connectors. MCMs have numerous advantages, but also have limitations. 
One limitation is that the spacing between the holes (which 
contain the vias) is limited to about 200 microns, as 
indicated in Figure 2. One reason for this spacing limitation is that the pins 
which punch the holes in which the vias reside cannot be 
positioned closer than about 200 microns. This 200-micron 
spacing causes problems when an integrated circuit having a 
smaller pin spacing, such as that shown in Figure 2, is to be 
attached. A second problem is that the MCM experiences random size 
changes during the firing process. The MCM shrinks during 
firing about 15 or 20 percent, and each (shrunken) part varies 
from its fellow parts by 0.5 %: a size variation ranging from 
- 0.5 % to + 0.5 % occurs. For example, if intended spacing between the VIAs 
indicated in Figure 3 is 254 millimetres (10 inches), then, 
after firing, the spacing will range from 253 to 255 
millimetres (9.95 to 10.05 inches). This random variability 
limits the accuracy with
