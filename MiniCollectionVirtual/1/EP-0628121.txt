Plastering and lining strip (18) for window stiles 
(8), door stiles or the like at the transition to the plaster 

(46, 48), having the following features: 

(a) the strip (18) has a base region (20) which is provided 
on its rear side with an adhesive strip (16) for 

securing the strip (18) to the window stile (8), door 
stile or the like; 
(b) the strip (18) has at least one web (22) which projects 
away from the front side (52) of the base region (20) 

and extends along the strip (18); and 
(c) a strip-shaped protective cover plate (24) is provided 
which is connected to the base region (20) of the strip 

(18) by way of a break-off material bridge (44) of small 
thickness, 
 
characterized in that 


(d) the base region (20) of the strip (18) has a strip-shaped 
spacing extension (28) between the protective 

cover plate (24) and the web (22), or - in the case of a 
plurality of webs (22) - between the protective cover 

plate (24) and the web (22) closer to the protective 
cover plate (24),  

 
(e) wherein a plaster-receiving space (34) which has an 
essentially L-shaped cross-section is formed by the 

spacing extension (28) and said web (22); 
(f) the spacing extension (28) has a width (a) that 
essentially corresponds to the thickness of an upper 

plaster layer (48) to be applied; and 
(g) the spacing extension (28) - viewed from the side 
when the protective cover plate (24) is broken off - 

has a small end thickness so that when the plaster 
(48) is inserted into the plaster-receiving space, 

the strip material is completely or nearly completely 
covered. 
Strip according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the spacing extension (28) transitions into the small end 

thickness to be rounded. 
Strip according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the spacing extension (28) transitions into the small end 

thickness to be chamfered. 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 

3, characterized in that it has a second web (22) which 
projects away from the front side (52) of the base region 

(20) and extends along the strip (18), and is further away 
from the protective cover plate (24) than the first web (22) 

and is spaced from the first web (22).  
 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
4, characterized in that the first web (22) and/or the second 

web (22) is undercut in such a way that a movement of the 
plaster (46, 48) away from the front side (52) of the base 

region (20) is prevented by means of positive fit. 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
5, characterized in that the first web (22) and/or the second 

web (22) has [have] perforations (50). 
Strip according to claim 6, characterized in that, 
in some of the perforations (50) or in all of the 

perforations (50), the edges of the perforations (50) are 
aligned in their rear region with the front side (52) of the 

base region (20). 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
7, characterized in that, on its rear side, the protective 

cover plate (24) has a spacing rib (38) that extends along 
the protective cover plate (24) and preferably has such a 

height that it ends essentially in one plane with the rear 
side of the adhesive strip (16).  

 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
8, characterized in that the protective cover plate (24) has 

an adhesive layer (40) on its front side for securing a 
protective film (42). 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
9 , characterized in that it has a device (60) for clamping a 

reinforcing fabric (56) to be embedded into the plaster. 
Strip according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the clamping device has a strip-shaped clamping plate (60) 

that is connected to the strip (18) by way of a bendable 
material bridge (58) and is shapped in the clamping position 

with its end (62) behind a strip projection (64). 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
11, characterized in that a piece of reinforcing fabric (56) 

is connected to it when delivered.  
 
Strip according to at least one of claims 1 through 
12, characterized in that it is made of plastic.
