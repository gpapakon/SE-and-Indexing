<ABSTRACT>
Flexible, slabstock, polyurethane foam compositions useful for a rapid-cool process 
are produced in the presence of a tetravalent tin catalyst, preferably at a relatively low 

isocyanate index, and preferably with a polyol that contains a non-volatile inhibitor. The 
foams of the invention eliminate or greatly reduce the amount of visible smoke produced 

in a rapid-cool process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polyurethane foams and a process for producing them. 
In particular, the invention is a polyurethane foam that produces a reduced amount of 
visible smoke when the freshly made foam is subjected to a rapid-cool process. Flexible, slabstock polyurethane foam is an open-celled, porous foam that is 
widely used in furniture, mattresses, carpet underlay, and many other applications for 
which cushioning is desired. The polymerization reaction to make polyurethane foam 
is exothermic, and much of the heat generated in the reaction is trapped within the 
foam, which is a good insulator. Foams are typically left to cool and cure for hours, or 
even days, to allow them to stabilize. Unfortunately, even foams that are allowed to 
cure slowly at ambient temperature do not usually develop uniform physical properties 
throughout the foam, largely because of the vast temperature gradient that develops 
across the foam during and after polymerization. To overcome some of the problems of uneven curing of polyurethane foams, 
Ricciardi et al. (U.S. Patent No. 3,890,414) developed a rapid-cool process in which a 
freshly polymerized polyurethane foam bun is uniformly cooled by passing a large 
quantity of a cooling gas through the foam mass, preferably by applying a vacuum to 
one surface of the foam bun. This process is also known as "forced-air cooling."  The rapid-cool process described in U.S. Patent No. 3,890,414 reduces the 
amount of time required for cooling foams, and gives products with more uniform 
physical properties. A drawback of the rapid-cool process is that the cooling gas 
initially exhausted from the foam contains particulate matter as is evidenced by a 
visible smoke plume. When large foam buns are produced, a substantial amount of 
smoke is exhausted to the atmosphere, and this smoke is a concern to slab foam 
producers. Recent patents describe newer approaches to post-treating freshly made 
flexible polyurethane foams. U.S. Patent No. 5,188,792, for example, teaches to post-treat 
a polyurethane foam by recirculating reactant-laden air through a foam block that 
has been slit along opposing faces. U.S. Patent No. 5,171,756 teaches a three-stage cooling process. In stage 
one, cooled air is drawn through the foam and is then exhausted to the atmosphere. 
The reference suggests that the exhausted air contains excess water, BHT, and a 
minor proportion of TDI ureas. This air is exhausted to the atmosphere to prevent 
BHT and TDI ureas from clogging heat exchangers. In stage

A flexible, slabstock polyurethane foam suitable for use in a rapid-cool process 
and prepared by reacting a polyether polyol, toluene diisocyanate, and water in the 

presence of a surfactant, an amine catalyst, and a tetravalent tin catalyst; wherein the 

freshly prepared foam produces a reduced amount of visible smoke during a rapid-cool 
process compared with a freshly prepared conventional flexible slabstock foam, which is 

prepared in the absence of a tetravalent tin catalyst. 
A process for reducing the amount of smoke produced from a flexible slabstock 
polyurethane foam during a rapid-cool process, said process comprising: 


(a) preparing the foam from a polyether polyol, toluene diisocyanate, and water 
in the presence of a surfactant, an amine catalyst, and a tetravalent tin catalyst; and 
(b) rapidly cooling the freshly prepared foam by passing a cooling gas through 
the foam. 
The process of claim 2 wherein the amount of visible smoke produced from the 
foam during the rapid-cool process is reduced by at least about 50% compared with the 

amount of smoke produced from a conventional flexible slabstock polyurethane foam, 
which is prepared in the absence of a tetravalent tin catalyst. 
The process of claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the cooling gas is air. 
The foam of claim 1 or process of any one of claims 2 to 4 characterised in that 
the polyether polyol contains a non-volatile inhibitor. 
A foam or process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the 
non-volatile inhibitor is selected from alkylated phenols and bisphenols; alkylidene bis-, 

tris-, and polyphenols; thio and dithio bis-, tris- and polyalkylated phenols; phenol 
condensation products; amines; esters; organic phosphites and phosphates; and mixtures 

thereof. 
A foam or process as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the 
tetravalent tin catalyst is selected from mono-, di- and trialkyltin esters, thioesters, 

mercaptides, and hydroxyalkylmercaptides. 
A foam or process as claimed in claim 7 characterised in that the tetravalent tin 
catalyst is a dialkyltin diester. 
A foam or process as claimed in claim 8 characterised in that the tetravalent tin 
catalyst is dibutyltin dilaurate. 
A foam or process as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the 
isocyanate index is within the range of about 95 to about 110. 
A foam or process as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that the 
isocyanate index is within the range of about 98 to about 102.
