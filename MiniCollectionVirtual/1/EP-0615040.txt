<ABSTRACT>
A valve member which is suitable for use in a fluid control valve in a swimming 
pool cleaner, which is made from a resiliently deformable material and which has 

a tubular core (32,36) with a fastening formation (38) near one end and a 
substantially mushroom-shaped annular flexible component (34) at an opposed 

end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a valve and more particularly to a 
device for cleaning a submerged surface. A plurality of devices for cleaning submerged surfaces are described in 
the prior art. Such devices are exemplified for example in the 
specifications of South African patents Nos.87/6572, 84/10036, 77/7426, 
83/1155, 86/3403, 75/1166, 78/5946, 78/5947, 76/6618 and 88/2544. It is apparent from the prior art that many approaches have been relied 
on in providing cleaning devices of the kind referred to. There is a 
perceived demand or requirement for a valve, which is suitable for use in 
a cleaning device of the kind described, which is of simple construction, 
reliable and with a long life. The invention provides a valve which includes a body in which is formed 
a passage, the passage having an inlet and an outlet, and a valve member 
which is located in the passage between the inlet and the outlet, the valve 
member including a flexible element which is spaced from an inner wall  
 
of the passage to define an aperture for fluid flow, the flexible element 
being movable towards or away from the said wall to vary the size of the 
aperture. The flexible element may take on any suitable form. The flexible element 
may for example comprise an annular component which may be movable, 
substantially along its entire periphery, towards and away from the said 
wall. In one example of the invention the valve member is located substantially 
concentrically inside the passage to define an annular aperture around the 
flexible element. The invention also extends to a device for cleaning a submerged surface 
which includes the aforementioned valve, a mouth which is defined by the 
said body and which is adapted to be brought into suction communication 
with the surface which is to be cleaned, and wherein the passage is 
inclined to the said surface. The passage may be inclined at any suitable 
angle which may for example lie between 30째 and 60째 relatively to the 
surface. The outlet of the passage may be adapted to be connected via a flexible 
hose or conduit to a suction source.  The said mouth may be surrounded by a skirt, which may be flexible, 
which is adapted to lie in scraping contact with the surface which is to be 
cleaned. The invention also extends to a valve member which includes a core 
which is at least partially surrounded by a flexible element which is 
spaced from the core. The core and the element may be integrally formed. 
The core and the element may be formed from a resiliently

<CLAIMS>
A valve (22) which includes a body (12) in which is formed a 
passage (18,16), the passage having an inlet (14) and an outlet (20), and 

a valve member (30) which is located in the passage between the inlet 
and the outlet, characterized in that the valve member includes a flexible 

element (34,32) which is spaced from an inner wall (42) of the passage to 
define an aperture (44) for fluid flow, the flexible element being movable 

towards or away from the said wall to vary the size of the aperture. 
A valve according to claim 1 characterized in that the flexible 

element (34,32) includes an annular component (34) which is movable, 
substantially along its entire periphery, towards and away from the said 

wall. 
A valve according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the 
valve member (30) is located substantially concentrically inside the 

passage to define an annular aperture (44) around the flexible element 
(34,32). 
A device for cleaning a submerged surface which includes a 
valve according to any one of claims 1 to 3, the outlet (20) of the passage 

(18) being adapted to be connected via a flexible hose or conduit to a 
suction source, and which is characterized in that a mouth (14,52,54) 

which is defined by the said body is adapted to be brought into suction 
communication with the surface (50) which is to be cleaned, and in that 

the passage (18) is inclined at an angle of between 30째 and 60째 relatively 
to the surface. 
A valve member (30) which includes a core (32,36), which is 
at least partially surrounded by a flexible element (34) which is spaced 

from the core, and which is characterized in that the core (32,36) and the 
element (34) are integrally formed from a resiliently deformable material, 

and the core (32,36) is tubular. 
A valve member (30) according to claim 5 characterized in 
that the core (32,36), at an end which is remote from the flexible element 

(34), has a fastening formation (38). 
A valve member (30) which is made from a resilient 
deformable material and which includes a core (32) and a flexible circular 

surrounding element (34), and which is characterized in that the element 
(34) extends from a first end of the core substantially in a mushroom 

 
shape, the core (32) being tubular and including a fastening formation 

(38) near a second end which opposes the first end. 
A method of operating a cleaning device (10) which includes 
the steps of directing fluid flow through an aperture (44) which is defined 

in the cleaning device (10) and which is characterized in that the aperture 
(44) and by the step of varying the size of the annular aperture (44) 

thereby to vary the rate of fluid flow through the aperture in a manner 
which causes movement of the cleaning device over a submerged surface 

which is to be cleaned. 
A method according to claim 11 characterized in that the size 
of the annular aperture (44) is varied by allowing or causing the fluid flow 

through the aperture (44) to move at least a portion of a valve member 
(30) which defines at least part of the annular aperture.
