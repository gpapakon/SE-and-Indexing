<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a device 
for applying a removable message on a sign for consecutive 

repeated presentation of series of images and of 
the type wherein each image is made up of a plurality 

of image portions located on rotatable prisms or display 
screens having a cross section such as that of an equilateral 

triangle and wherein the same poster blades as 
for common billboards are used. The object of the invention 

is to permit an easier, safer and quicker replacement 
of messages. This is arrived at by providing each 

screen side (3) with a plastic foil (4) which covers said 
screen side and which is located at a small distance outside 

the screen side and by inserting from below into the 
space provided therebetween, the message in the form of 

a paper strip (28) by means of a rigid band (22) which 
from a coiled position on a tool located on a lower beam 

(1) of the sign is brought to enter between the screen-side 
and the plastic foil and to the uppermost portion 

(27) of which the incoming paper strip (28) is momentarily 
attached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to signs of that type 
wherein each image is made up of a plurality of image 
portions located on rotatable prisms or display screens 
having a cross section such as that of an equilateral 
triangle. Signs of this type are common and have existed for a 
long time. At many of these signs, the message is often 
replaced, e.g. once a week. Then, the message is often 
the same as on the billboards and it is supplied in a 
number of e.g. 6 or 18 sheets for a normally sized sign 
having a height of 3 m and a width of 4 m. At message  
 
replacement on these signs, one has hitherto removed 
the sides of the display screens from the core or body 
of each display screen. Each screen side has a height 
of 3 m and a width of 0,1 m and is made of metal. These 
removable screen sides are below referred to as screen 
blades and several patents exist relating to their 
design and attachment on the body. A pertinent example of the prior art is known from 
US-A-3 383 785 and corresponds to the preamble of claim 1. At replacement of a message on a side of the sign, one 
removes all the screen blades on the front side of the 
sign. These screen blades are transported to an atelier, 
wherein the old message of paper glued onto the screen 
blades is removed by soaking and scraping. The clean 
screen blades are thereafter put up on a stand in the 
atelier and the new sheets are glued on to the screen 
blades. After drying, the narrow strips between the 
screen blades (later the display screens or prisms) 
are cut away. The screen blades are removed from the 
stand and transported to the sign for attachment. A 
set of screen blades for one side of a sign weighs normally 
about 70 kg. Of course, several sets of screen 
blades can be used, whereby the work is facilitated. It 
is however a substantial and time consuming work to 
clean, fix and transport the heavy screen blades. The object of the present invention is to facilitate 
the replacement of messages consisting of the same paper 
posters used on common billboards. This is arrived at primarily by providing each screen 
side with a plastic foil which covers said screen side 
and which is located at a small distance outside the 
screen side and by inserting from below into the space 
provided therebetween, the message in the form of a 
paper strip by means of a rigid band which from a coiled 
position on a tool located on a lower beam of the sign  
 
is brought to enter between the screen side and the 
plastic foil and to the uppermost portion

<CLAIMS>
Device for applying a removable message on a sign for 
consecutive repeated presentation of series of images 

and of the type wherein each imaae is made up of a plurality 
of image portions (28) located on display screens or screen 

blades (3) which are mounted onto the lateral sides of triangular 
rotatable prisms, wherein paper posters 

as for common billboards are used, 
characterized in
 
that each screen blade (3) 

in an image is covered with a transparent plastic foil 
(4) which encloses both the longitudinal edges 

of the screen blade and which is maintained at a small 
distance outside the surface of the screen blade, and 

that during image replacement a tool is mounted on a 
lower beam (1) of the sign, which tool includes a wound 

or coiled rigid steel band (22) which band along with 
an image portion length (28), momentarily attached to its uppermost portion, can be inserted from below into 

the space between the screen blade (3) and the plastic 
foil (4) and push up the image length on the screen blade.  

 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that 
the screen blade (3, 29) has a chute 

(26, 32) in the middle for guiding the band (22) in 
lateral direction. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 
that each screen blade (3, 29) is defined 

by a blade which is removable from the other blades 
and which has grooves (30) in the longer or longitudinal 

edges thereof that are adapted to the longer 
or longitudinal edges of the plastic foil (4, 33) so 

that the foil can be applied and removed only in the 
longitudinal direction of the screen blade. 
Device according to any preceding claim, 

characterized in
 that the plastic foil (4, 33) is 
folded outwards (5, 34) down below and does not reach 

all the way down on the screen blade. 
Device according to any preceding claim, 

characterized in
 that the tool has rotatable pulleys 
(23) directly outside the band (22). 
Device according to any preceding claim, 

characterized in
 that the tool is provided with a 
guide channel (24) with pulleys (25) for guiding the 

band (22) from its wound or coiled position into engagement 
between the screen blade (3) and the plastic foil (4). 
Device according to any preceding claim, 

characterized in
 that at the end of the band (22) 
there is provided a wide support (27) which during winding 

of the band is supported by the guide channel (24). 
Device according to any preceding claim, 

characterized in
 that the tool includes a helical  
 

cylinder (19) with an arm (21), whereby limit stops on 
the band (22) can be obtained. 
Device according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in
 
that farthest down on the screen 

blade (29) there is provided a device (35) for preventing 
the paper length from sliding or shaking down. 
Method for applying a removable message on a sign 
for consecutive repeated presentation of series of images 

and of the type wherein each image is made up of a plurality 
of image portions located on display screens or screen 

blades (3) which are mounted onto the lateral sides of triangular 
rotatable prisms, wherein paper posters 

as for common billboards are used, 
characterized by
 
providing each screen side (3, 29) 

with a transparent plastic foil (4, 33) which covers 
the screen blade and which encloses both the longer or 

longitudinal edges of the screen side and inserting 
into the space defined between the screen blade and the
