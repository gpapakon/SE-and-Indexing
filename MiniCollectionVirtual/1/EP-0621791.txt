<ABSTRACT>
An air elimination system is provided for an intravenous fluid delivery system for intravenous injection of fluid into a patient. An air-detection apparatus (5) is disposed in an intravenous fluid line (3). A return line (8) is attached to a point in the line (3) below the air-detection apparatus (5). The other end of the return line (8) is attached to a chamber (1, 2, 12) where air may be separated from the fluid. The separation chamber may be a drip chamber (12), a metering chamber (2) or the intravenous supply (1). When air is detected, a valve (11) or valves (7, 9) are switched, so that the intravenous fluid is prevented from flowing to the patient, and so that, when a pump (4) is turned on, the fluid is pumped through the return line (8) to the separation chamber (1, 2, 12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to medical intravenous
fluid delivery systems and more specifically to such systems
that eliminate air bubbles from the intravenous fluid before
it is delivered to the patient as specified in the preamble
of claim 1. Such a system is known from US-A-4874359.It has been the object of many prior-art devices to
detect the presence of air bubbles in an intravenous line.
Such devices would normally set off an alarm to alert the
appropriate medical personnel, who would then lightly rap
the line to urge the bubbles up the line away from the
patient. It is a tedious procedure to urge all the bubbles
all the way up the IV line to the IV fluid reservoir. It is
even more difficult to remove bubbles located downstream of
a pump. Since, in an IV line that is not being pumped at
high pressure, small bubbles usually do not pose much danger
to the patient, busy medical personnel rarely go through the
trouble of urging the bubbles all the way up the line.
Consequently, the bubbles quickly move back down the line
and are detected again, thereby setting off the alarm again.
Thus, without an easy way of removing air from the IV line,
the prior-art air-detection systems are more of a nuisance
than an aid.At least one medical apparatus in the prior art
includes a line for recycling air removed from fluid back to
a reservoir without opening the fluid flow loop to the
environment. U.S. Patent No. 4,874,359 to White et al.
discloses a modular, power augmented medical infusion
apparatus to provide rapid transfusion of relatively large
quantities of blood, blood components, colloid and fluids to
patients who require large quantities of these blood
components to be rapidly transferred. The major components
comprise a pair of filtered cardiotomy reservoirs, an air
embolus sensor, a modular double roller pump, a heat 
exchanger, a bubble trap-filter and disposable fluid
conduits. The bubble trap-filter is located in the distal
most location of the recirculating loop just upstream of the
Y-connector to the patient and the air sensor just
downstream of the cardiotomy reservoir in the proximal
location of the recirculating loop. Blood is circulated
rapidly from the cardiotomy reservoir through the heat
exchanger wherein it is heated or cooled as needed and
through an air bubble trap filter having a nominal filtering
capability of 33 microns. A secondary path from the filter
is provided to permit the air trapped in the filter to be
recycled to the reservoir without opening the infuser loop
to the

<CLAIMS>
An air elimination system, for an intravenous
fluid delivery system for intravenous injection of fluid

into a patient, comprising:

an intravenous line (3);
separation means (2,12,52) for permitting the separation of air
from the fluid;
air-detection means (5), disposed in the intravenous line,
for detecting air in the fluid, and emitting a fault-condition

signal;
a return line (8) connecting the separation means to a
point in the intravenous line downstream of the air-detection

means;
valve means (7,9,11), disposed in the intravenous line (3) and
return line (8), for permitting (i) flow through the return line

or (ii) to the patient;
pump means (4);
and
control means (10), in communication with the air-detection
means, characterized in that the valve means is operable by said control means which comprises means

for (i) setting the valve means to permit flow
through the return line and activating the pump means, so as

to move air and fluid from the air-detection means to the
separation means, in response to a fault-condition signal,

and otherwise (ii) setting the valve means to permit flow to
the patient.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the air-detection
means (5) includes flow-measurement means for

measuring fluid flow rate.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the pump
means includes a pump (4) disposed in the intravenous line

upstream from the valve means.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the
sepa
ration means includes a metering chamber (2).
A system according to claim 1, wherein the
separation means includes a drip chamber (12). 
A system according to claim 1, wherein portions of
the air-detection means (5), the valve means (7,9) and the pump means (4)

are formed in an integral device.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the
separation means includes an intravenous fluid reservoir (1)
A system according to claim 7, wherein the return
line (8) and portions of the air-detection means (5), the valve

means (7,9) and the pump means (4) are formed in an integral device.
A method for eliminating air from an intravenous
fluid delivery system, having a chamber (2,12,52) where air may

separate from the fluid, a pump (4), an intravenous line (3) and an
air detector (5), comprising the steps of:


detecting air in the fluid;
emitting a signal when a specified amount of air is
detected in the fluid;

providing a return line (8) from a point in the intravenous
line between the pump (4) and the first valve;
providing a second valve (9) in the return line (8);
closing the first valve (7) in response to the signal; and
