<DESCRIPTION>
Recent advances in genetic engineering have provided the
requisite tools to transform plants to contain foreign genes. It is now
possible to produce plants which have unique characteristics of
agronomic and crop processing importance. One such advantageous
trait is enhanced starch and/or solids content and quality in various crop
plants. WO 91/19806 reports the use of a gene which encodes
ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGPP), which catalyzes a key step
in starch and glycogen biosynthesis. The preferred gene is from E. coli
and the resulting enzyme is a poorly regulated, highly active variant.Another desirable trait is the reduction of oil in certain food
crops, such as peanuts. Decreasing the lipid content in the seeds of
certain plants is desirable due to health concerns or for improved
processing qualities. For example, a low calorie peanut butter, having a
higher starch content and lower oil content would be beneficial. Also,
soybeans having lower oil content would be better for producing certain
products, such as tofu, soy sauce, soy meat extenders, and soy milk. In
addition, lower oil content in certain seed-derived products is desirable,
such as corn starch or wheat flour. It has surprisingly been found that
such fat reduction is accomplished by expression of a gene encoding a
deregulated ADPGPP, such as glgC16 in the seeds.The present invention provides structural DNA constructs
which encode an ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGPP) enzyme
and which are useful in producing seeds having a reduced oil content.In accomplishing the foregoing, there is provided, in accordance
with one aspect of the present invention, a method of producing
genetically transformed plants which have elevated starch content,
comprising the steps of:
(a) inserting into the genome of a plant cell a recombinant,
double-stranded DNA molecule comprising
(i) a promoter which is selected from the group
consisting of seed specific promoters, (ii) a structural DNA sequence that causes the
production of an RNA sequence which encodes a
fusion polypeptide comprising an amino-terminal
plastid transit peptide and an ADPglucose
pyrophosphorylase enzyme,(iii) a 3' non-translated DNA sequence which functions
in plant cells to cause transcriptional termination
and the addition of polyadenylated nucleotides to
the 3' end of the RNA sequence;(b) obtaining transformed plant cells; and(c) regenerating from the transformed plant cells genetically
transformed plants which have an elevated starch
content.In accordance with another aspect of the
