Process for assembling a tyre casing (2) and a
prevulcanised annular tread (1), according to which:


the annular tread (1) is placed on the radially inner
surface of annular support means (10) for the tread

(1), said support means (10) being deformable under the
effect of a radial stress directed towards the

exterior,
the annular support means (10) for the tread (1) are
caused to rotate to extend the annular tread (1) by

centrifugation so that, in the extended state, its
smallest diameter is greater than the largest diameter

of the tyre casing (2),
the tyre casing (2) is placed in an area adjacent to
the annular tread (1) so that their circumferential

planes of reference coincide,
the extension of the annular tread (1) is reduced
progressively until it makes contact with the tyre

casing (2).
Assembly process according to claim 1,
characterised in that the support means (10) for the

annular tread (1) and the support means (21, 22) for
the casing (2) are caused to rotate simultaneously.
Assembly process according to one of claims 1 and
2, characterised in that the contact of the radially

inner surface of the annular tread (1) and the crown of
the casing (2) is established in a vacuum.
Assembly process according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that, after having established

contact of the radially inner surface of the annular
tread (1) and the crown of the tyre casing (2), the

zone of contact is subjected to a static pressure.
Assembly device for a tyre casing (2) and a
prevulcanised annular tread (1), comprising:


a frame (3); 
support means (10, 22) for the annular tread (1)
and the tyre casing (2), said support means (10, 22)

being rotatably mounted relative to the support (3) and
being deformable under the action of a radial stress

directed outwards;
means (17) for causing said support means (10, 22)
to rotate; and
means of relative displacement (20) of said
support means (10, 22) to make the circumferential

planes of reference of the annular tread (1) and of the
tyre casing (2) coincide.
Assembly device according to claim 5,
characterised in that the support means (10) for the

annular tread (1) includes a membrane (11) of semi-toric
shape mounted within a cylindrical support (12),

the inside diameter of said membrane (11) being
adjustable.
Assembly device according to claim 6,
characterised in that the internal diameter of the

membrane (11) is adjustable by modifying the pressure
within the chamber (19) formed by said membrane (11)

and the cylindrical support (12).
Assembly device according to one of claims 6 and
7, characterised in that the axial and circumferential

positioning of the plane of symmetry of the membrane
(11) is effected by n attachment elements (13),

distributed in the same circumferential plane of the
cylindrical support (12), of which one end is attached

to said cylindrical support (12), and the other end,
sliding radially, is attached to the membrane (11) in

its plane of symmetry.
Assembly device according to claim 8,
characterized in that a fraction f of the n attachment

elements (13) have, on the side of its end attached to
the membrane (11), a removable device (14) of a shape

adapted to the tread pattern of the annular tread (1) 
which effects the axial and circumferential positioning

of said tread (1) during the entire assembly operation.
Assembly device according to one of claims 6 to 9,
characterised in that, by increasing the pressure in

the chamber (19) between the membrane (11) and the
cylindrical support (12), the zone in contact between

the annular tread (1) and the tyre casing (2) is
subjected to static compression.
Tyre obtained by the assembly of a prevulcanised
annular tread (1) and a casing (2) by implementing the

process of one of claims 1 to 4.
