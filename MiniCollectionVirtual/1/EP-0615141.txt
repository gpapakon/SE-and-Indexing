<ABSTRACT>
A polymer is inserted into a cylinder (1) and heated, and a pressure is 
then applied to the polymer so as to extrude the same in the shape of a fiber 

from a nozzle (3). In the meantime, a diffusible material is injected from a nozzle 
(5) into the central portion of a molten liquid of this polymer through a 

thin-tube cylinder (4), and it is diffused gradually from the central portion of 
the molten polymer to the circumferential portion thereof as it flows toward a 

discharge port of the nozzle (3). The material extruded from the nozzle (3) is 
air-cooled and taken up around a drum (7) via a roller (6). The fiber-like 

molded product provides a distribution of refractive index varying continuously 
from the center thereof toward the circumferential portion thereof, and 

serves as a convergent or divergent plastic light transmitter. Conversely, even 
when the molten liquid of the polymer is extruded from the nozzle (5), a light 

transmitter having a region in which a refractive index varies continuously can 
be obtained. A proper number of the cylinders 
and various kinds of materials 
to be supplied to the cylinders can be selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing various plastic optical transmission
bodies including distributed-refractive-index polymer
optical fiber, distributed-refractive-index optical
waveguide, distributed-refractive-index rod lens,
single-mode polymer optical fiber, and polymer optical
fiber having an optical functionality.A glass optical transmission medium having a region
in which refractive index varies from the center of
linear body or bar-like body toward the outer periphery
has been already proposed and put into practical use.
In particular, the glass optical transmission medium is
used as an optical transmission medium having a
refractive index distribution capable of providing the
bandwidth characteristics required for the application
to the optical communication.However, the glass optical transmission medium
involved a problem in its mechanical properties such as
poor flexibility and poor shock resistance. It also has
some other drawbacks such as low productivity and high
production costs.In contrast with the distributed-refractive-index
type glass optical transmission medium, methods of
manufacturing distributed-refractive-index optical
transmission medium have been proposed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 3-42603, 3-64704, 3-65904,
3-81701, 3-91703, 3-81704 and 3-81706.These manufacturing methods, however, had various
drawbacks. For example, in the manufacturing method of
the optical transmission medium using the difference
between the reaction ratios of monomers constituting a
polymer, it was impossible to manufacture the optical
transmission medium having an elongated transmission
distance because the manufacturing method is comprised
of a batch process.On the other hand, the method of manufacturing the
optical transmission medium using a melt spinning
method exhibited an inconvenience that the control of
the distribution of refractive indices is difficult to
perform since the materials conferring a transparency
are not to be selected due to its copolymer method
using two or more types of monomers having reactivity.In EP-A-0 130 838 is disclosed a method of
manufacturing a synthetic transmission article based on
diffusion of a monomer (Mb). The diffusion of the
monomer (Mb) occurs in the network polymer produced
through incomplete polymerization of another monomer
(Ma) having refractive index different from that of the
monomer (Mb).Therefore, the diffusion involves copolymerization
of both monomers (Ma and Mb). In general, such
copolymerization brings
