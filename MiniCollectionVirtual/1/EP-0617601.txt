<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles
such as diapers, sanitary napkins, adult incontinence
devices, and the like which have meltblown components.All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured
for the absorption of body fluids such as menses,
urine, and feces are, of course, well known. Absorbent
articles are typically comprised of a number of layers of
material. These generally include, from top to bottom, a
liquid pervious layer, an absorbent layer, and a liquid
impervious layer. Additional layers may also be interposed
between any of these layers. Such additional layers
may serve various different purposes.These layers are generally held together around
their peripheries by some conventional means, such as
adhesives, crimping, fusing, and other methods known
in the art. The absorbent articles can have, and in many
cases preferably will have, a liquid impermeable bond
around their periphery. This will not interfere with the
function of the absorbent article. However, it is frequently
also desirable to bond the layers together at
their faces. The attachment of the faces of these layers
presents certain technical problems. This is particularly
the case when it is desired to attach the upper liquid
pervious layers and absorbent layers. The same means
used for attaching the layers at their peripheries cannot
be used because they will tend to block the flow of liquids
to the absorbent layer.A number of attempts have been made to deal with
this problem. These have included utilizing hot melt
adhesives, and other non-water based adhesives. Such
adhesives will be less likely to dissolve when contacted
by body liquids. Other attempts have been directed at
applying adhesives in very thin layers or in particular
patterns to attempt to minimize the interference with the
flow of liquids to the underlying layers. U.S. Patent
4,573,986 issued to Minetola, et al. on March 4, 1986
discloses one preferred way of applying adhesives.
Although the application of adhesives in the manner
described in the Minetola, et al. patent works quite well,
the search for improved ways of securing the faces of
the layers of absorbent products has continued.The main reason for searching for improved ways of
securing the faces of such layers is that in many cases,
adhesives which initially function adequately, may eventually
fail and cause the liquid pervious layer to become
unattached. This problem is particularly apparent during
prolonged use of an absorbent article. This problem is
often heightened when the
