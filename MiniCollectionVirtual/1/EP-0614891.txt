Process for the production of 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazole-4-carbaldehydes
of the general formula



in which R means a linear or branched C
1
-C
6
 alkyl
group, a linear or branched C
2
-C
6
 alkenyl group, a
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl

group or a benzyl group or phenyl group optionally

substituted with halogen, nitro, amino and/or alkyl,
characterised in that a glycine ester hydrohalide of

the general formula


in which R
2
 means an alkyl group and X denotes a
halogen atom, is initially reacted with an imide acid

ester of the general formula


in which R has the stated meaning and R
3
 means an alkyl
group, in the presence of a base to yield the

corresponding 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of the general
formula 



in which R has the stated meaning, this compound is
then chlorinated to yield a 2-substituted

4-chloroimidazole of the general formula


in which R has the stated meaning and the latter is
finally reacted with phosphorus oxychloride or

phosgene in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide to
yield the final product of the formula II.
Process according to claim 1, in which an alkali metal
hydroxide or an alkali metal alkoxide is used as the

base.
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, in which
the reaction to yield the 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of

the formula V is performed within a pH range between 7
and 12.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which
the reactants for the reaction to yield the

3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of the formula V, namely
glycine ester hydrohalide, imide acid ester and base,

are reacted in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which
the reaction temperature for the reaction to yield the 

3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one of the formula V is between
-20°C and 50°C.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which
the chlorination to yield the chloroimidazole of the

formula I is performed with thionyl chloride or
phosphorus oxychloride.
Process according to claim 6, in which the
chlorination is performed with phosphorus oxychloride

at a reaction temperature of between 20°C and 110°C.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7, in which
the reactants of the final stage, namely the

2-substituted 4-chloroimidazole of the formula I, the
phosphorus oxychloride or the phosgene and the

N,N-dimethylformamide are reacted in a molar ratio of
1:1:1 to 1:5:5.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 8, in which
the reaction temperature in the final stage is between

50°C and 130°C.
