<ABSTRACT>
A multipole connector insert (2) to be built into a connector housing (1) suitable for fastening to a wall (251) of the housing of a switch cabinet or the like is provided with contact inserts which allow variable multiple occupation of the contact tubes (10) or the like. The connector insert (2)  has a first part (4) with a first number of connector inserts and a second part (5) with a number of connection contacts which corresponds to the number of connector inserts. Each contact insert in the first part is permanently connected in a conductive manner to at least two connection contacts in the second part. In addition, an opening (21) is provided in the second part (5) in which a contact bridge (20) may be clamped in order to establish a conductive connection between adjacent pairs of connection contacts.
