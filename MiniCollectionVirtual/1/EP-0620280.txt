<ABSTRACT>
Novel cosmid cloning vectors are disclosed. Such 
vectors facilitate many steps involved in cloning 

chromosomal DNA restriction fragments from streptomycetes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a set of novel cosmid 
cloning vectors that facilitate gene cloning in a wide 
variety of streptomycetes, including the avermectin-producing 
microorganism Streptomycesavermitilis. The application of recombinant DNA techniques in 
antibiotic-producing microorganisms constitutes an 
increasingly important area of biotechnological research. 
Streptomycetes are gram-positive microorganisms that are 
well known for their ability to produce a variety of 
commercially useful therapeutic substances. Over 60% of 
known naturally-occurring antibiotics come from the genus 
Streptomyces. The development of gene cloning technology in 
streptomycetes is opening new possibilities in the 
industrial utilization of streptomycetes for the production 
of useful compounds. Recombinant DNA techniques are 
presently applied to improve screening strategies and titres 
of fresh isolates; to generate novel structures which are 
not made in naturally-occurring isolates; to clone and 
express antibiotic biosynthetic genes in heterologous hosts; 
and to program, at the genetic level, new strains having the 
ability to perform novel or improved specific tasks not 
found in the original parental isolates. Cosmid vectors are modified plasmids that carry at 
least one copy of the DNA sequences (cos sequences) required 
for packaging DNA into bacteriophage lambda particles. 
Cosmids carry an origin of replication (usually the ColE1 
origin) and a drug resistance marker (usually 
ampicillin-resistance), and they can be introduced into E. 
coli by standard transformation procedures and propagated as 
plasmids. Cosmid vectors are valuable instruments for 
cloning large regions of chromosomal DNA because of their 
ability to carry fragments of genomic DNA ranging in size 
from about 35 to about 45 kilobases (kb).  Streptomyces DNA has an extremely high guanosine and 
cytosine content (about 70%). In addition, streptomycetes 
have relatively large genomes (approximately 10‚Å∑ base pairs). 
Thus, their DNA content is about three times that of 
Escherichiacoli. This genome complexity makes the cloning 
of large fragments particularly useful when constructing 
streptomycetes DNA libraries. Assuming random DNA cleavage 
and optimal representation of the chromosome in the clone 
library, the number of clones to be screened is directly 
related to genome size and inversely related to the average 
size of the DNA inserts. Therefore, it is advantageous to 
clone large pieces of DNA in order to reduce the number of 
cl
