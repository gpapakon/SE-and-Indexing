<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photopolymerizable 
composition. Particularly, it relates to a 
photopolymerizable composition showing a very high 
sensitivity to light rays in the visible light range and 
having an excellent visible image developing property. Heretofore, a number of image forming methods have 
been known in which a photopolymerizing system is 
utilized. For example, there are a method wherein a 
photopolymerizable composition comprising an addition 
polymerizable compound containing an ethylenic double 
bond and a photopolymerization initiator, and optionally 
as an additional component an organic polymer binder, is 
prepared, this photopolymerizable composition is coated 
on a substrate to obtain a photosensitive material 
provided with a layer of the photopolymerizable 
composition, exposure of a desired image is conducted so 
that the exposed portion is polymerized and cured, and 
the unexposed portion is then dissolved and removed to  
 
form a cured relief image; a method wherein a layer of a 
photopolymerizable composition is formed between a pair 
of substrates, at least one of which is transparent, 
exposure is conducted from the transparent substrate side 
so that a change in the bonding strength is created by 
the radiation, and then the substrate is peeled off to 
form an image; and a method wherein an image is formed by 
utilizing a change in the adhesion of a toner caused by 
radiation to a layer of a photopolymerizable composition. 
As the photopolymerization initiator of the 
photopolymerizable composition used in these methods, 
benzoin, benzoin alkyl ether, benzil ketal, benzophenone, 
anthraquinone, benzil or Michler's ketone has been 
employed. These photopolymerization initiators have an 
ability to initiate photopolymerization with light rays 
of short wavelength in the ultraviolet light range of at 
most 400 nm. However, their photopolymerization 
initiating ability with light rays in the visible light 
range of at least 400 nm is very low, which has limited 
the applicable range of the photopolymerizable 
compositions containing them. In recent years, with the progress of image-forming 
techniques, there has been a strong demand for 
photopolymers highly sensitive to light rays in the 
visible light range. For example, they are 
photosensitive materials suitable for non-contact type 
projection exposure plate making or laser plate making by  
 
a visible ray laser. Among such techniques, a plate 
making system employing an oscillation beam of visible 
light
