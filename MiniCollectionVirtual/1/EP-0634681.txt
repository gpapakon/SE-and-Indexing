<ABSTRACT>
This invention involves a fiber probe device and a method of making it. 
The probe includes a relatively thick upper cylindrical region (43,44), typically in 

the form of a solid right circular cylinder, terminating in a tapered region (42) that 
terminates in a relatively thin lower cylindrical region (tip) (41), typically also in the 

form of a solid right circular cylinder, the lower region having a width (diameter) in 
the approximate range 0.01 µm to 150 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to probe devices, and more particularly to 
metrological fiber probe devices and to methods of making and using them. More than 100 years ago, the famous physicist Ernst Abbe described a 
fundamental limitation of any microscope that relies on any lens or system of lenses 
in an imaging system to focus light or other radiation: diffraction obscures (makes 
fuzzy) those details of the image that are smaller in size than approximately one-half 
the wavelength of the radiation. In order to circumvent this limitation, researchers 
have investigated the use of, interalia, various types of imaging probes. Scanning 
tunneling microscopy (hereinafter "STM") devices, atomic force microscopy 
(hereinafter "AFM") devices, and near-field scanning optical microscopy (hereinafter 
"NSOM") are some examples of different types of probe microscopes. U.S. Patent No. 4,604,520, describes, interalia, a probe device having 
an aperture located at the tip of a cladded glass fiber that has been coated with a 
metallic layer. The aperture is drilled into the metallic layer at the tip of the fiber at 
a location that is coaxed with the fiber. The (immediate) neighborhood of the tip is 
composed of a section of solid glass fiber that has obliquely sloping (truncated 
conical) sidewalls, whereby the sidewalls do not form a cylinder of any kind. 
Therefore, as the probe device laterally scans a rough surface, the calculations 
required to determine the desired information on the actual contours (actual profile) 
of the surface of the sample body require prior detailed knowledge of the slanting 
contours of the sidewalls of the probe, and these calculations typically do not yield 
accurate metrological determinations of the desired profile of the contours of the 
surface of the sample body, especially at locations of the surface of the sample body 
where sudden jumps (vertical jumps) thereof are located. In addition, fabrication of 
the probe device is complex and expensive, especially because of the need for 
drilling the aperture coaxially with the fiber. This invention provides a probe device and a method for making it, as 
recited in claims 1 and 7, respectively. More specific embodiments of the invention 
are recited in the dependent claims. As used herein, the term "maximum width" 
refers to the maximum diameter--i.e., the length of the longest line segment that can 
be drawn in a cross section of a cylindrical region of a fiber segment, the line 
segment being oriented perpendicular to the axis of the

A probe device comprising: 
   a fiber segment having a relatively thick upper cylindrical region (43,44) 

terminating in a tapered region (42) that terminates in a relatively thin right 
cylindrical lower region (41); the lower cylindrical portion having a maximum width 

in the approximate range of 0.01 µm to 150 µm and terminating at its bottom 
extremity in an essentially planar end surface oriented perpendicular to the axis of 

the thin right cylindrical region. 
The probe device of claim 1 in which the thin cylindrical region has a 
height in the approximate range of 0.05 µm to 30 µm. 
The probe device of claim 1 in which the thin cylindrical region has a 
height in the approximate range of 1 µm to 10 µm. 
The probe device of claim 1 in which the maximum width of the thin 
cylindrical region is in the approximate range of 0.05 µm to 0.2 µm. 
The probe device of claim 1 in which the maximum width of the thin 
cylindrical region is in the approximate range of 0.05 µm to 0.5 µm. 
The probe device recited in claim 1 further including a metallic layer

A method of making a probe device comprising the steps of: 

(a) providing an initial cylindrical fiber segment; 
(b) etching, prior to step (c), a lower cylindrical region of the fiber 
segment for a first predetermined time duration, whereby the maximum width of the 

lower cylindrical region becomes less than that of an upper cylindrical region of the 
fiber segment; 
(c) cleaving the tip of the lower region of the fiber, whereby a cleaved 
lower region of the fiber is formed; and 
(d) etching, subsequent to step (c), the lower cylindrical region of the 

fiber for a first predetermined time duration, whereby the width of the lower 
cylindrical region is reduced to a predetermined value, but the width of the upper 

cylindrical region remains essentially unchanged.

approximate range of 0.01 µm to 150 µm. 
The method of claim 7 in which the predetermined value is in the 
approximate range of 0.05 µm to 0.2 µm.

axis of the lower cylindrical region. 
A method in accordance with claim 7 followed by coating the 
sidewalls of the lower cylindrical region with an optically reflecting layer. 
A method in accordance in claim 7 further comprising, prior to the 
step (b), the step of coating the sidewalls of an uppermost cylindrical region of the 

fiber segment with a protective layer that is not etched by the etching of the step (b) 
and removing a lower portion of the protective layer prior to the step (d). 
The method of claim 7 in which the etchings of steps (b) and (d) are
