<ABSTRACT>
There is described a finite state machine that may receive actuator signals 
and has a plurality of elementary sequential logic elements fed by said actuator signals. 

Through various interconnections between the elements a first set of interconnected 
logic states is realized that are activated through combined occurrence of a particular 

predecessor state and an associated actuator signal. In various ones of said logic states a 
particular output signal is produced. Furthermore, the finite state machine has a subset 

of redundant logic states that are aggregated together with a particular operational by 
appropriate interconnections for collectively emulating the operational state in question.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a finite state machine, comprising: 
actuator signal input means; a plurality of sequential logic elements fed by said actuator signal input means 
and through various interconnections between said elements realizing a first set 
of interconnected logic states, each respective logic state being selectively 
activated through combined occurrence of a particular predecessor state and an 
associated actuator signal received; output signal means fed by said logic elements for under control of each 
member of at least a first subset of said logic states outputting an output signal 
privy to said each member; and wherein said finite state machine furthermore has at least one second subset 
of logic states.  
In principle, any piece of sequential logic can be considered as such a finite state 
machine. Applications are therefore in realizing control functions as well as data 
processing functions. Such finite state machines have been realized at various technological 
levels and have been used in various applications. The term finite relates to the finite 
number of states. A particular use is for test control purposes on an integrated circuit 
chip or on a higher level of testing, such as a printed circuit board. The actuator signal 
or signals often is a recurrent signal, that may have one or more phases. Another 
representation is by a set of various distinct control signals receivable from elsewhere. 
Also, if a clock signal, it may be combined with one or more condition signals. The 
output may be a single control and/or data signal, or a whole range of such signals. The 
logic elements are usually binary, but this is not an express limitation, inasmuch as an 
element could be as well ternary, quaternary, etcetera. If binary, the total number of 
states is a power of two. However, the total number of states necessary for specifying 
the function of the finite state machine, the first subset of states, is usually not a power  
 
of two, which means that there are other states, a second subset of states, that in 
principle are superfluous for the originally intended functionality. In consequence, these 
other states are redundant. However, such redundant state could be entered through 
some accidental event, such as by power on, through some external interference, soft 
error, or other cause. It is a problem that reverting to normal operation would not be 
ensured automatically. Accordingly, amongst other things it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a finite state
