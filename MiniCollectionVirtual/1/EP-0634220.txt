<ABSTRACT>
A device for the rough separation of building rubble by the sink-float process is proposed, there being provided a water tank for accommodating the building rubble, a discharging device taking the form of a scraping conveyor for sinking material and a discharging device for floating material, characterized in that there is provided at one of the ends of the water tank a feeding chute (9) for building rubble, a central scraping conveyor (11) which is adjacent to the feeding chute and first points downwards and then upwards in the direction in which the sinking material is conveyed and a removal belt (19), which runs transversely to the longitudinal axis of the water tank, for floating material, the removal strips of which preferably at least come into contact with the surface of the water in the water tank.
