<CLAIMS>
Device for the non-chipping cutting of timber boards (11) from a squared timber 
(2), with a machine frame and a feed mechanism (6) which conveys the squared timber 

(2) in longitudinal direction against a knife-edge (10) located obliquely at an angle to it, 
with a thrust strip (9) at a distance from the knife-edge (10) fitted to a timber guiding 

surface (8), characterized in that two measurement mechanisms (3, 4) for the thickness 
of the squared timber (2) are located in a transverse direction to the squared timber (2) at 

a distance from each other and that a relative swing takes place between the knife-edge 
(10) and the timber guiding surface (8) joined to the thrust strip (9) around a pivot axis 

(15) running essentially transversely to the knife-edge (10), as a function of the 
measurement result determined by the measurement mechanisms (3, 4) by means of a 

swing control (23, 25, 28, 29). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the timber-guiding surface (8) 
guiding the squared timber (2) is located fixed to the frame, with the thrust strip (9) 

fitted to it and that the knife-edge (10) is fitted to a knife support (13) supported in a 
hinged manner in the machine frame (14). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the knife-edge (10) is fitted 
fixed to the frame and that the timber-guiding surface (8) joined to the thrust strip (9) is 

pivoted in the machine frame (14). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the knife-edge (10) is fitted to 
a knife support (13), which can be pivoted in the machine frame (14) around a pivot axis 

(15) running transversely to the knife-edge (10) and parallel and at a distance from the 
timber-guiding surface (8) by means of the swing control. 
Device for the non-chipping cutting of timber boards (11) from a squared timber 
(2), having a machine frame and with a feed mechanism (6) which conveys the squared 

timber (2) in a longitudinal direction against a knife-edge located obliquely at an angle to 
it, having a thrust strip (9) fitted to a timber-guiding surface (8) running at a distance 

from the knife-edge (10) and with at least one measurement device covering the 
thickness of the squared timber, according to one of Claims 1-4, characterized in that the 

distance can be adjusted between the knife-edge (10) and the timber-guiding surface (8) 
joined to the thrust strip (9), during the passing through of the squared timber (2) by  

 
means of an adjustment mechanism (25', 28, 29) as a function of at least two 

measurements of thickness of the squared timber (2) made at a distance from each other 
lengthwise. 
Device for the non-chipping cutting of timber boards (11) from a squared timber 
(2), with a machine frame and with a feed mechanism (6) which conveys the squared 

timber (2) in a longitudinal direction against a knife-edge located obliquely at an angle 
to it, with a thrust strip (9) fitted to a timber-guiding surface (8), running at a distance 

from the knife-edge, and with at least one measurement mechanism covering the 
thickness of the squared timber, characterized in that the distance between the knife-edge 

(10) and the timber-guiding surface (8) joined to the thrust strip (9) can be adjusted 
during the passage of the squared timber (2) by means of an adjustment mechanism (25', 

28, 29) as a function of at least two thickness measurements of the squared timber (2) 
taken at a distance lengthwise. 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the timber-guiding 
surface (8) guiding the squared timber (2) with the thrust strip (9) joined to it is located 

fixed to the frame and that the knife-edge (10) is fitted on a knife carrier (13) supported 
in the machine frame (14) which can be adjusted transversely. 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the knife-edge (10) is 
fitted fixed to the frame and that the timber-guiding surface (8) joined to the thrust guide 

(9) is supported on the machine frame (14) so that it can be adjusted transversely. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in that the thrust strip (9) with the 
timber-guidi
ng surface (8) is fitted on a thrust strip slide block (26), which can be driven 
in a slide guide support (27) transversely to the thrust strip (10). 
Device according to Claims 1 and 9, characterized in that the slide guide 
support (27) can be swung around a pivot axis (32) running transversely to the thrust 

strip (9) or to the knife-edge (10) and parallel and at a distance from the timber-guiding 
surface (8), by means of the swing control (25', 28, 29). 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the knife-edge (10) or the 
timber-guiding surface (8) with the thrust strip (9) is supported on the machine frame 

through two separately adjustable lifting units (28, 29), essentially perpendicularly to 
the timber plane on the machine frame (14), which are located in a longitudinal direction 

to the knife-edge (10) or the thrust strip (9) at a distance from each other.
