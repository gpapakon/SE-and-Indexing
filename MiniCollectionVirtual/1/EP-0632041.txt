<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the pharmaceutical field. It relates 
to novel morphine derivatives. More in particular, the present invention 
relates to morphine derivatives having specific physicochemical 
properties which allow a pronounced narcotic-analgesic type of effect. Morphine and codeine are the most important phenanthrene alkaloids 
of opium. Modification of the morphine molecule is a known method to 
change the pharmacological properties of morphine and codeine. 
Modifications that have been described and that resulted in molecules 
having analgesic properties include methyl substitution at the C-3 site 
(codeine), substitution at both C-3 and C-6 by acetyl (3,6-diacetyl-morphine 
= heroin), and by nicotinoyl (3,6-dinicotinoyl-morphine = 
nicomorphine, Vilan®). These structures lack the phenolic hydroxyl group 
which contributes strongly to the affinity for the opioid receptors 
[Reden J. et al, J. Med. Chem.22: 256 (1979); Lobbezoo M.W. et al. Eur. 
J. Pharmacol. 82: 207-211 (1982)], and the low activity at the receptor 
level fails to account for the powerful analgesic effect of these 
compounds. Subsequent studies have shown that the phenolic compounds are 
formed due to a rapid metabolic cleavage of the C-3 bond [Proceedings of 
the Vilan workshop, Graz 1987, Kopra H, Booy L.H.D.J. eds., 1988]. 
Analgesic activity is retained by the molecule when the 6-OH position is 
substituted by a nicotinoyl moiety [Koopman-Kimenai P.M. at al, Pharm. 
Weekbl. Sci13 142-147, (1991), Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol.41: 375-378 
(1991)]. When 3,6-dinicotinoylmorphine is administered to patients, 
6-mononicotinoylmorphine, morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are the 
active compounds. Some of the molecules that result from a metabolic 
conversion have a greater potency than that of parent compounds, as 
evidenced by the significantly lower ED₅₀. Thus, the effectiveness of the 
C-3 nicotinoyl-substituted morphine derivatives is explained by the 
effectiveness of the metabolic products rather than that of the parent 
substances. Substitutions at C-3 and C-6, however, result in physicochemical 
properties of the resulting molecules that differ from those of  
 
morphine, and such changes favour the transport into the central nervous 
system. There, too, active metabolites are formed. The lipid solubility 
of nicomorphine at a pH of 7.4 is about 10-fold higher than that of 
morphine, and this results in a lower ED₅₀. Moreover, the substitutions 
have been shown to enhance the safety of the drug in the specific 
applica
