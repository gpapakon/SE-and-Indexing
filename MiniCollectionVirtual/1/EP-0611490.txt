<ABSTRACT>
Terrestrial antennas (10A, 10B and 10C) which are capable of transmitting and receiving radio signals directly to and from satellites in low Earth orbit are disclosed. The preferred embodiments of the invention employ printed circuit antenna elements (18) measuring only a fraction of an inch (less than 2 cm) in diameter. One embodiment (10A) includes an elevation array residing on a circular surface (14) and an azimuth array residing on a conical surface (12). This first embodiment (10A) resembles a flattened pyramid. Both the top and the curved exterior of the pyramid support circular, slotted, printed circuit patches (18). Other embodiment of the invention employ hemispherical (10B) or cylindrical (10C) configurations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent application is related to the
following co-pending patent applications:
WO 93/09613 - Satellite Communication System; Method of Conducting a Telecommunications Business
Implemented on a Computer by Edward Fenton Tuck, as
signed United States Serial Number 07/895,295;WO 93/09624 - Switching Methods for Satellite Communication
System;WO 93/09614 - Beam Compensation Methods for Satellite
Communication System;WO 93/09578 - Spacecraft Antennas & Beam Steering

System by Douglas Gene Lockie et al., assigned
United States Serial Number 07/915,172; andWO 93/09029 - Spacecraft Designs for Satellite Communication
System.The present invention relates to the field of satellite communications. More
particularly, this invention provides a compact, electronically steerable, phased-array antenna
for use with a portable, hand-held telephone.While cellular phones now offer convenient service for mobile and portable
telephones that was uncommon only a decade ago, currently available cellular service is
limited in scope, and is often unreliable and subject to interference and interruption.
Conventional cellular systems utilize a network of land-based antenna towers called "cell
sites," which send and receive microwave signals that link customers using mobile phones in
their vehicles or hand-held portable units. Since cell sites are only found in densely populated
areas, cellular service is severely limited. Communication links in this network are frequently
impaired when a customer travels from one geographical cell to another, or when hills or
buildings occlude the line-of-sight pathway of the microwave radiation which carries the
signals.Recent attempts to overcome these shortcomings of widely-available cellular service
have met with mixed results. Elaborate and heavy transportable phone systems which include
a large satellite dish for communication directly with geosynchronous satellites have recently
become commercially available. These systems are bulky, require large power supplies and
are extremely expensive.No single public communications network is presently capable of offering continuous
world-wide service to a customer using a mobile or portable phone without the use of costly
and large antenna systems. The overwhelming majority of commercial spacecraft and
transponders which are currently operating do not generally possess the power capacity to
communicate directly With a hand-held telephone
