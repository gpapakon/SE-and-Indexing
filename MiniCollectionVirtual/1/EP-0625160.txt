<ABSTRACT>
A novel cytokine composition, the method for its preparation and the use of the composition in the immunotherapy of various diseases such as bacterial infections, viral infections and cancers is disclosed. The novel method involves adding two novel ingredients, which are termed transal and a complex of proteinase inhibitors to a virally-induced leukocyte culture. The resulting cytokine composition comprises human leukocyte interferon, Interleuken 1, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Migration Inhibitory Factor, and Leukocyte Migration Inhibition Factor in their naturally occurring ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel cytokine
composition, a method for its preparation, and the use of
the preparation in the immunotherapy of various diseases
such as bacterial infections, viral infections and cancers.The immune system provides defence for the body
against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi
and parasites. More recently, it has been shown that the
state of the immune system can be linked to the susceptibility
to developing certain types of cancers. For example,
it has been shown that in certain immune deficient
states, most notably Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS), the incidence of cancer is greatly increased.
Immunotherapy has become an important therapy against
various infectious agents and even in the treatment of
cancer. One branch of immunotherapy involves using
immunomodulating agents that can modulate, induce or
increase the immune response.One group of immunomodulating agents that has
been extensively studied includes the cytokines. Cytokines
are the chemical messengers of the immune system and are
produced by immune cells such as lymphocytes and monocytes.
One cytokine, namely interferon (IFN), has been shown not
only to induce the immune system but also to act directly
on tumors to inhibit proliferation of the tumor cells.
Interferon is well known in the art. Details on its
characterization as well as methods for its preparation can
be found in Methods in Enzymology, Volume 119,
"Interferons, PART C" 1986.Although both crude as well as purified preparations
of cytokines, such as interferon, are currently
available, the problems with these known preparations
include the following. Crude preparations generally contain
proteinases which break down the cytokines and thereby
decrease the stability of the preparation. Proteinase 
inhibitors are available but these are generally toxic or
antigenic to man and thus are not useful in therapeutic
applications. On the other hand, while purified interferon
is generally proteinase free, the methods for purifying
interferon known to date generally result in a poor yield
of interferon. Furthermore, the biological activity of a
purified preparation is generally lower than that of a
crude interferon preparation.Early in the 80s, it was observed that a crude
preparation of interferon activated human natural killer
cells (NK) more effectively than purified IFN prepared from
the same batch of crude IFN. As shown in Table A the
highest degree of NK activation can be achieved with a
crude IFN titer of 50 IU/ml and a
