<ABSTRACT>
A differential pressure measuring system is disclosed. 
The system includes two quartz capacitive pressure trans­

ducers (14, 16). Each capsule contains a pressure sensitive 
capacitor (Csa; Csb) and a pressure insensitive reference 

capacitor (Cra; Crb). The pressure sensitive capacitors (Csa, 
Csb) are excited by out-of-phase signals (Vr,-Vr) which 

further excite the reference capacitors (Crb, Cra) out of 
phase, respectively. The outputs of all capacitors (Csa, Csb, 

Cra, Crb) are combined in a summing junction (22) whose 
output controls the count of a digital integrator (34). A closed 

loop is formed by converting the output of the integrator (34) 
to a negative feedback signal (-Vrf(N)) which is applied to the 

summing junction (22) through a feedback capacitor (Cf). The 
integrator (34) incrementally changes the feedback signal 

(-Vrf(N)) in a direction to balance the loop. At this point the 
output of the integrator (34) is representative of the mea­

sured differential pressure.
