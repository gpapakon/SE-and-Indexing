<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a shower floor (tray) support made of moulded foam in the form of an approximately cuboid-shaped block having a floor recess (18), two adjacent outer faces (10, 12) of the block are each fashioned differently in respect of their cross-sectional shape than the other two outer faces (14, 16) and a mounting chamber (20, 22) is constructed in each of two diagonally opposite corner regions, with the result that the desired visible side of the shower floor support is freely selectable, irrespective of the position of the floor drain as provided in the building.

<CLAIMS>
A shower tray support made of moulded foam in the form 
of an approximately square block with a rectangular or 

square horizontal cross section and with a tray recess (18), 
which opens towards the top and is appro
ximately shaped to 
match the outer form of the tray which is to be 

accommodated, and an assembly chamber, which opens towards 
the bottom and is constructed in a corner region in the base 

of the tray support, characterised in that two adjacent 
outer surfaces (10, 12) of the block in each case have a 

like vertical cross sectional form, but have a different 
shape to the other two adjacent outer surfaces (14, 16) of 

the block, and an assembly chamber (20, 22) is constructed 
in each case in at least two diagonally opposed corner 

regions. 
A shower tray support according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it has a substantially square 

horizontal cross section and exactly two assembly chambers 
(20, 22) are constructed in diagonally opposed corner 

regions. 
A shower tray support according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it has a rectangular horizontal cross 

section and assembly chambers (420, 421, 422, 423) are 
constructed in all four corner regions. 
A shower tray support made of moulded foam in the form 
of an approximately square block with a substantially square 

horizontal cross section and with a tray recess (18), which 
opens towards the top and is approximately shaped to match 

the outer form of the tray which is to be accommodated, and 
an assembly chamber, which opens towards the bottom and is 

constructed in a corner region in the base of the tray 
support, characterised in that two opposing outer surfaces 

(110, 114) of the block in each case have a like vertical  
 

cross sectional shape, but have a different shape to the 
other two opposing outer surfaces (112, 116) of the block, 

and an assembly chamber (120, 122) is constructed in each 
case in at least two adjacent corner regions. 
A shower tray support according to claim 4, 
characterised in that an assembly chamber (120, 122) is 

constructed in each case in exactly two adjacent corner 
regions. 
A shower tray support in the form of an approximately 
square block with a substantially square horizontal cross 

section and with a tray recess (18), which opens towards the 
top and is approximately shaped to match the outer form of 

the tray which is to be accommodated, and an assembly 
chamber, which opens towards the bottom and is constructed 

in a corner region in the base of the tray support, 
characterised in that at least three of the outer surfaces 

(210, 212, 214) of the block have a different vertical cross 
section in each case, and assembly chambers (220, 221, 222) 

are constructed in at least three corner regions. 
A shower tray support according to claim 6, 
characterised in that exactly three of the outer surfaces 

(210, 212, 214) of the block have a different vertical cross 
sectional form and two adjoining outer surfaces (214, 216) 

are of like shape, and assembly chambers (220, 221, 222) are 
constructed in exactly three corner regions, but not in the 

corner region lying opposite the corner region adjoining the 
two like-shaped outer surfaces (214, 216). 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the outer 

surfaces is constructed to be substantially continuously 
vertical (cross sectional form A)  

 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the outer 

surfaces is constructed to be outwardly inclined (cross 
sectional form B). 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the outer 

surfaces is constructed to be substantially vertical with an 
undercut step in the lower region (cross sectional form C). 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that, in the region of each 

assembly chamber (20, 22), the tray recess (18) comprises an 
opening (24, 26) for the outflow fixtures of a tray, said 

opening leading to the assembly chamber, being 
prefabricated, defined by markings or selectively broken 

open by means of intended breakage sites. 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that, on both sides of the block 

remote from the corner region associated with the assembly 
chamber, an inspection aperture (28) is associated with each 

assembly chamber (20, 22), said aperture leading towards the 
assembly chamber, being prefabricated, defined by markings 

or selectively broken open by means of intended breakage 
sites. 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that, on at least one, but 

preferably on each side of the block, at least one opening 
(30) for the introduction of assembly foam is provided, said 

opening leading through the side wall of the block into the 
tray recess (18), being prefabricated, defined by markings 

or selectively broken open by means of intended breakage 
sites.  

 
A shower tray support according to claim 13, 
characterised in that the opening (30) has a diameter of 

between 5 mm and 50 mm. 
A shower tray support according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the tray recess (18) is 

provided with support nubs (34) distributed over the wall of 
the tray recess. 
A shower tray support according to claim 15, 
characterised in that the support nubs (32) are multi-stepped

claims, characterised in that spacing elements (36) 

extending substantially horizontally are foamed onto at 
least one, but preferably each side of the block. 
A shower tray support according to claim 18, 
characterised in that the spacing elements (36) are multi-stepped 

in such a manner that their cross section decreases 
in stepped fashion in the direction away from the associated 

side of the block.
