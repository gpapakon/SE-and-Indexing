<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10) for separating from an article (14) 
an outer material thereon. The apparatus (10) comprises 

a conveyor (12) adapted to convey the article (14) at a 
first predetermined velocity to a separator arrangement 

(18). 
The separator arrangement (18) has at least one 

surface (24) for engagement with the article (14), the 
surface (24) being adapted to travel at a second 

predetermined velocity different from the first 
predetermined velocity, whereby, upon engagement of the 

article (14) with the surface ( 24), the material is 
separated therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for separating 
outer materials from articles. In the tobacco industry, it is often necessary to 
recycle cigarettes that have been unused and are still 
in packets wrapped with plastics film or paper. In such 
cases, automatic unwrapping machines are provided. The 
disadvantage of such machines is that, frequently, the 
outer wrapping material is not removed and becomes 
entrained in the tobacco to be recycled. It is an object of this invention to obviate 
and/or mitigate the above disadvantage. According to one aspect of this invention there is 
provided apparatus for separating from an article an 
outer material thereon, said apparatus comprising a 
conveyor adapted to convey the article at a first 
predetermined velocity to a separator arrangement the 
latter having at least one surface for engagement with 
the article, the surface being adapted to travel at a 
second predetermined velocity different from the first 
predetermined velocity, whereby, upon engagement of the 
article with the surface the material is separated 
therefrom.  Preferably, the second predetermined velocity is 
higher than the first predetermined velocity. The first 
predetermined velocity may be substantially constant. In a first embodiment, the separator arrangement 
comprises first and second engagement surfaces, 
travelling at different predetermined velocities to each 
other. The first engagement surface may be upstream from 
the second engagement surface and many have a velocity 
lower than the velocity of the second engagement 
surface. In the first embodiment, first and second 
conveyors may be provided such that the article may be 
delivered to the second conveyor from the first conveyor 
after engagement with said second engagement surface. A 
third engagement surface may be provided to engage said 
article on the second conveyor. Preferably, the second 
conveyor is so arranged that the second engagement 
surface constitutes the third engagement surface. The 
second conveyor may have a predetermined velocity 
greater than the predetermined velocity of the first 
conveyor. Preferably the first, second and third engagement 
surfaces are defined by rollers. Alternatively, the 
first, second and third engagement surfaces may be  
 
defined by wheels having pneumatic tyres thereon. The 
wheels may be go-kart type wheels, suitably having tyres 
of a nominal 10'' diameter. Conveniently, the tyres may 
also include an inner tube. In a second embodiment, the separator arrangement 
comprises
