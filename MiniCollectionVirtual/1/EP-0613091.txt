<ABSTRACT>
In a parallel data transfer circuit, 
processing at a data transfer source circuit is 

simplified to reduce the time required for transfer and 
the data storage area of the data transfer destination 

circuit can be used more effectively. A 
plurality of data register sets (DR1 to DRn) for 

temporarily latching parallel data and a plurality of 
corresponding flag register sets (FR1 to FRn) are 

provided between a data transfer source circuit (1) and 
a data transfer destination circuit (2). A register 

designation signal is outputted from the data transfer 
source circuit (1) to designate a data register into 

which data should be written. Only when data should be 
written into the data register, a flag is placed into a 

corresponding flag register. The data transfer 
destination circuit (2) fetches data only from the data 

registers corresponding to those flag registers in which 
a flag is held, parallel data can be received without 

forming discontinuous empty portions in the data 
storage area of the data transfer destination circuit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a parallel data
transfer circuit which transfers parallel data from a
transfer source circuit to a transfer destination
circuit in a digital communication apparatus or a like
apparatus.Various parallel data transfer circuits are
conventionally known, and an exemplary one of
conventional parallel data transfer circuits is shown in
FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 2, in the parallel data
transfer circuit shown, parallel data are transferred
from a data transfer source circuit 201 to a data
transfer destination circuit 202. In order to allow the
data transfer source circuit 201 to perform data storage
address control of the data transfer destination circuit
202, an address signal 211, an upper byte write signal
212 and a lower byte write signal 213 are sent from the
data transfer source circuit 201 to the data transfer
destination circuit 202 before parallel data are 
transferred from the data transfer source circuit 201 to
the data transfer destination circuit 202. For transfer
of parallel data which include word data of 16 bits and
byte data of 8 bits in a mixed condition, it is
necessary to prepare a data bus of a word width and
provide a change-over circuit such as an upper byte data
selector 203 and a lower byte data selector 204 between
the data transfer source circuit 201 and the data
transfer destination circuit 202 so that an upper byte
and a lower byte of the parallel data may be selected.
Such changing over is controlled by the data transfer
source circuit 201 (refer to, for example, Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Application No. Showa 62-32748, No.
Showa 62-49735 or No. Heisei 1-238338).The parallel data transfer circuit further
includes a data bus 214 for 8 bits between the data
transfer source circuit 201 and the upper byte data
selector 203, another data bus 215 between the data
transfer source circuit 201 and the lower byte data
selector 204, an upper byte data select signal line 216,
a lower byte data select signal line 217, a further data
bus 218 for 8 bits between the upper byte data selector
203 and the data transfer destination circuit 202, and a
still further data bus 219 between the lower byte data 
selector 204 and the data transfer destination circuit
202.The conventional parallel data transfer circuit
described above is disadvantageous in that processing at
the data transfer source circuit 201 is complicated and
much time is required for transfer since the data
transfer source circuit 201 performs changing over
between the upper byte data selector 203 and the lower
by
