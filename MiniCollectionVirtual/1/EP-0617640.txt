<CLAIMS>
An electrostatic precipitator having collecting 
electrodes arranged in a honeycomb shape, which consist 

of star-shaped elements, each star-shaped element 
consisting of three wall parts (1, 2, 3) connected 

centrally to each other which are each arranged at an 
angle of 120Â° to each other, with at least one pipe 

section (1', 2', 3', 5', 6') being arranged on the 
outer edges of each wall part in the longitudinal 

direction, the pieces of pipe sections (2', 5', 6') of 
two adjacent star-shaped elements being arranged one 

above the other in each case and the individual star-shaped 
elements being connected together by a 

connecting rod (4) which is arranged in each case in 
the pipe sections (1', 2', 3', 5', 6') of at least two 

adjacent star-shaped elements. 
An electrostatic precipitator according to Claim 
1, in which the star-shaped elements are made of an 

electrically conductive plastics material.
