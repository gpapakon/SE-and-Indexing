<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for isomerizing 
dimethylnaphthalene (DMN) in gaseous phase in the presence of 

a solvent comprising an aromatic hydrocarbon having a boiling 
point of 150°C at the highest (e.g. benzene) under 

atmospheric pressure by using a catalyst comprising hydrogen-form 
mordenite. According to the above method, the objective 

2,6-DMN minimized in the contents of impurities can stably be 
produced in high selectivity and high yield under mild 

reaction conditions for a long period of time, while side 
reaction is suppressed to minimum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
2,6-dimethylnaphthalene which is useful as a starting raw
material for 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. 2,6-naphthalene
dicarboxylic acid is industrially important as a
starting raw material for polyethylene naphthalate which is
employed for producing high-performance polyester in the form
of fiber or film having excellent tensile strength and heat
resistance.2,6-dimethylnaphthalene (hereinafter dimethylnaphthalene
is sometimes abbreviated to "DMN") is employed as a starting
raw material for 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and is
called upon to have a high purity.DMN has 10 isomers according to the positions of two
methyl groups. It is necessary, however, to produce 2,6-DMN
substantially free from an isomer other than 2,6-DMN on a
large scale at a low cost. It is well known that in the case
of isomerizing DMN, isomerization between adjacent
β-positions and isomerization of methyl-migration from one
ring to another are unlikely to take place as compared with
that between α-position and β-position. Specifically, the
above-mentioned 10 DMN isomers are classified into four
groups, namely A to D groups as undermentioned with regard to
isomerization, and isomerization among different groups is
unlikely to take place as compared with that in the same 
group.
Group A --- 1,5-DMN; 1,6-DMN; and 2,6-DMNGroup B --- 1,8-DMN; 1,7-DMN; and 2,7-DMNGroup C --- 1,4-DMN; 1,3-DMN; and 2,3-DMNGroup D --- 1,2-DMNAs the process for producing 2,6-DMN, there are
available a process in which naphthalene or methylnaphthalene
is methylated, succeedingly isomerized and separated,
isolation process from tar fraction or petroleum fraction and
the like. However, the fraction or the reaction product
according to any of the above-mentioned processes contains
almost all the isomers in the aforesaid four groups, thereby
necessitating the isomerization among different groups to
take place for the purpose of efficiently producing 2,6-DMN
by the isomerization of such isomers. As the method of
isomerization among different groups, there is disclosed, for
example in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
88433/1984, a method in which is employed a zeolite having
ten-membered oxygen ring at the inlet of the major cavity.
However, the above-disclosed method gives rise to a number of
side reactions such as disproportionation in addition to the
isomerization because of an elevated temperature required for
the reaction, thus lowering a yield of useful 2,6-DMN. That
is to say, a process
