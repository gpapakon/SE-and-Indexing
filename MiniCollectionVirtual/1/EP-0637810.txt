<CLAIMS>
A reader for data cards (20), comprising a printed circuit
and electrical connecting contacts of said printed circuit,

wherein said printed circuit comprises at least one coil
(28) for contactless transmission of energy and data

between the printed circuit and a data medium on the data
card (20), characterized by at least a first yoke part for

the magnetic backflow of the coil (28) in the area of the
printed circuit and a second opposed yoke part for the

magnetic backflow in a part of the reader arranged in said
housing, wherein the ends of the first yoke part extend

through a printed circuit board (24) and the yoke parts
being arranged in such a way that a data card may be

inserted between the yoke parts and the printed circuit
board (24) being a flexible construction element comprising

the printed circuit and further contact strips.
A reader according to claim 1 with a carriage (14) arranged
to descend towards the data card (20) when inserting the

data card (20), on which carriage the printed circuit board
(24) being fixed, wherein the contact strips (26) extend

out of the reader (10) via a flexible connection zone (24a)
of the printed circuit board (24).
A reader according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the printd
circuit board (24) is folded to form at least two

superposed layers.
A reader according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
printed circuit board (24) comprises two mutually spaced

adjacent coils (28). 
A reader according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
contact strips (26) are electrically connectable to

corresponding contacts (26') projecting towards the data
card (20) in their inserted position and may be activated

by the flexible connecting zone (24a) of the printed
circuit board (24) by a plug connector.
A reader according to claim 5, wherein the electrical
connecting strips of the coil(s) (28) run parallel to the

contact strips (26) on the common flexible connecting zone
(24a) of the printed cicuit board (24).
A reader according claim 1 comprising a stationary housing
(15) arranged to receive a data card (20) and a printed

circuit board (24) fixedly secured to the housing (15)
wherein the coil(s) (28) is (are) arranged on the surface

of the printed circuit board (24) which faces the data card
(20) and/or which faces away from the data card (20).
A reader according to claim 7, wherein the housing (15)
comprises a carriage (14) arranged to descend towards the

printed circuit board (24) and receiving the data card
(20).
A reader according to claim 7 or 8, wherein the printed
circuit board (24) consists of a base body, coated on one

or on both sides with a foil comprising the printed circuit
and the coil(s) (28).
