<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to environmental chambers for testing electrical
circuit boards and, more particularly, to a chamber-inserted carrier for holding
multiple circuit boards to be tested.A carrier for housing printed circuit boards is disclosed in US-A 3,271,626. The
carrier comprises two groups of frame-supported shelves and one group includes
adjacent shelves.Most types of electronic equipment, e.g., TV sets, aircraft navigation devices
and the like, incorporate circuit boards made of a thin, flat dielectric sheet. The
sheet has resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits and other components mounted 
on it. While some boards are "hard-wired" using conventional soldered
wiring, printed circuit boards (or "PC boards") are more common. Such PC
boards employ flat foil strips (applied by a process akin to printing) as the
"wiring" for component interconnection.Many applications for circuit boards involve hostile operating environments
particularly including temperature extremes and, sometimes, rapid excursions
between such extremes. Unless recognized in board construction and testing,
such environments can cause premature failure of the board per se and/or of
the components mounted thereon. For example, radios used in mobile equipment
such as military vehicles often experience extremes of heat and cold. And
aircraft electronic gear similarly experiences such extremes - but over a much
shorter time span. For example, a military aircraft may be at summer desert
temperatures and at subzero temperature at high altitude only a few minutes
later.To help assure that circuit boards provide the requisite degree of reliability in
such applications, board manufacturers often subject them to temperature tests
by placing them within environmental chambers capable of producing rapid and
extreme changes in temperature. For example, such a chamber might provide a
temperature change of from -40째 C (-40째F.) to over 93째 C (200째 F.) in about
30 minutes. A prominent designer and manufacturer of such environmental test
chambers is Thermotron Industries, Inc., of Holland, Michigan.A significant concern of circuit board manufacturers is the ability to test large
quantities of boards economically. Testing of several hundred circuit boards per
working shift is not unusual. Where such boards fill a high production requirement 
such as for passenger automobiles, circuit board test facilities are
absolutely required to keep pace with the emands of modern, rapid production.
Clearly, the environmental test chamber and its

<CLAIMS>
Carrier (10) for testing circuit boards (20) having a frame (29) and plural
locations for mounting the circuit boards (20) during test and comprising

two groups (91a, 91 b) of frame-supported shelves (31, 33, 35), at least
one group including at least two adjacent shelves (31, 33, 35) forming a

two-shelf-group,
characterized in that

each shelf (31, 33, 35) has a shelf edge (67, 71) for removably
mounting a mother board (39) thereon to accommodate a circuit board

(20) supported by one group (91a, 91b) or by both groups (91a, 91b)
depending upon the board length, the position of at least one of the

adjacent shelves (31, 33, 35) being adjustable on the frame (29) to
select the spacing between the adjacent shelves (31, 33, 35) to accommodate

circuit boards (20) of differing widths. 
The carrier of claim 1 wherein each of both groups (91 a, 91 b) includes at
least two adjacent shelves (31, 33, 35) each having a shelf edge (67,

71) for removably mounting a mother board (39) thereon.
The carrier of claim 1 wherein:

one of the groups (91a, 91b) includes at least three shelves (31,
33, 35) forming a three-shelf-group;
separate mother boards (39) are mounted at differing positions
with respect to a reference;
a mother board (39) extends between the shelves (31, 33, 35) of
the two-shelf group and another mother board (39) extends between

two adjacent shelves (31, 33, 35) of the three-shelf group;
and
such mother boards (39) are mounted upon differing shelf edges
(67, 71),

whereby the carrier simultaneously accommodates circuit boards of differing
sizes.
The carrier of claim 1 wherein at least one shelf edge (67, 71) has means
(69) for releasably attaching a pair of oppositely-extending mother boards

(39) thereto, thereby minimizing the number of shelves (31, 33, 35) required
for mother board (39) mounting.
The carrier of claim 4 wherein the frame (29) is a perimeter frame having
a substantially open interior and the shelf edges (67, 71) are interior of

the frame (29) whereby circuit boards (20) are readily inserted between
shelves. 
The carrier of claim 1 wherein each shelf (31, 33, 35) in each group
(91a, 91b) has an exterior edge (67) and an interior edge (71) attached

to a mother board (39), the frame (29) and the exterior edges (67) of
shelves (31, 33, 35) in a group (91a, 91b) defining an opening whereby

circuit boards (20) are inserted to and removed from either or both of
two carrier sides.
The carrier of claim 6 wherein such interior and exterior edges (71, 67)
are generally parallel to one another and circuit boards (20) are inserted

to and removed from either or both of two opposing carrier sides.
Use of the carrier of claim 7 in a chamber (11) having an axis of carrier
movement and wherein circuit boards (20) are oriented along axes generally

normal to such axis of movement.
The carrier of claim 1 further including a back plane and wherein:

each shelf (31, 33, 35) has an interior edge (71);
plural shelves (31, 33, 35) in each group (91a, 91b) have a
mother board (39) extending between shelf interior edges (71);
at least one mother board (39) includes a connector cable (101);
and,
at least one mother board (39) associated with a group (91 a, 91 b)
is spaced from at least one mother board (39) associated with the

other group (91b, 91a) to define a slot (103),

whereby the connector cable (101) may be extended to the back plane
(51). 
The carrier of claim 9 wherein the frame (29) has a height, all mother
boards (39) associated with a group (91a, 91b) are spaced from those

associated with the other group (91b, 91a) and the slot (103) extends
along substantially the entirety of the frame height whereby all connector

cables (101) may be extended to the back plane (51).
