<DESCRIPTION>
 SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY ALLELES OF BRASSICAFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to cDNA sequences which code for glycoproteins involved in the self-incompatibility reaction in Brassica species. The present invention is also directed to a method for the identification and isolation of other cDNAs and genes having homology to genes of the self-incompatibility locus of Brassica species and other plants. The present invention is further directed to a method for conferring the self- incompatible phenotype on compatible plants.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSelf-incompatibility (SI) is a genetically controlled self- recognition system which prevents inbreeding in plants. This self-recognition system results in the rejection of self-pollen by the female somatic tissues of the plant. There are two major homomorphic types of self-incompatibility which differ with respect to the determination of specificity expressed by pollen. (Uyenoyama, M.K., Genetics, 128:453-469, 1991). In gametophytic self- incompatibility, specificity is determined in the gametophyte stage by the genotype of the pollen tube itself. If the pollen carries the same allele as one of the two alleles in the pistil, fertilization is not achieved. In sporophytic self- incompatibility, the incompatibility reaction occurs between factors carried by the pollen but are specified by the diploid tissues of the pollen parent and a product of the female pistil. This is thought to be due to the expression of SI factors in the tapetum.Some naturally occurring SI lines have been found in rutabagas for example in B . napus L. ssp. rapifera Metzg. Sins . , (Gowers, S., Euphytica 23:205-208, 1974.) and oilseed rape, B . napus L. ssp. oleifera Metzg. . . (Olsson, G. , Hereditas 

46:241-252, 1960). Self-incompatible rutabagas have also been produced using SI rapeseed plants found in Swedish winter rapeseed cultivars that trace at least part of their ancestry to artificial (resynthesized) B . napus (Olsson, G. , Kungl. Lantbruksakademiens Tidskrift 92:394402, 1953; Olsson, G. , Hereditas 46:241-252, 1960; Olsson, G. , Hereditas 46:351-386, 1960; Gowers, S., Euphytica 23:205-208, 1974; Gowers, S., Euphytica 24:537-541, 1975; Gowers, S., Proceedings of the Eucarpia 'Cruciferae 1979' Conference, Wageningen, The Netherlands. October 1-3, 1979). There are no apparent fertility barriers between these subspecies of B . napus . Self-incompatibility in Brassica is sporophytic and is controlled by a singe genetic locus, the S-locus. The diploid species, B .
