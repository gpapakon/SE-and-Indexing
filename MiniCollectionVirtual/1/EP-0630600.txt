<ABSTRACT>
This bed or sleeping berth structure comprises:   - in the ceiling (1), a recess (3) which is open downwards and is intended to serve as a holder for the movable parts of the structure;   - articulated on the inner walls of this recess (3) by at least one axle (5) parallel to the ceiling, a part (4) forming a support for the bed or the sleeping berth; - articulated on the part (4) forming a support for at least one pivoting axle parallel to the axle (5) of articulation of this part (4) on the holder (3), a bed or sleeping-berth frame (6); - means (8,9) for controlling the part (4) forming a support and the bed or sleeping-berth frame (6); - and means for locking the part (4) forming a support and the bed or sleeping-berth frame (6) in each of their respective positions.

<CLAIMS>
A bed or couchette assembly which can be retracted 
into a ceiling (1), comprising: 


in the ceiling (1), a downwardly open recess (3) 
intended to receive the movable parts of the assembly; 
hinged to the inner walls of said recess (3), by 
at least one axis (5) parallel to the ceiling, a part (4) 

forming a support for the bed or couchette, said part (4) 
being able to assume two positions, i.e. a first position in 

which, in the retracted position, it fills the recess 
provided in the ceiling, and a second position in which it 

projects out of said recess; 
hinged to the part (4) forming a support, by at 
least one pivot axis (7) parallel to the pivot axis (5) of 

said part (4) on the recess (3), a bed or couchette frame 
(6), said frame being adapted to assume two positions, i.e. 

a first position, in which it is applied against the part 
(4) forming a support, and a second position in which said 

frame is disposed horizontally and adjacent a vertical 
partition (2) of the area in which it is to be installed, in 

the operative position of the bed or couchette, parallel to 
the ceiling; 
means (8,9) for controlling the part (4) forming 
a support and the frame (6) of the bed or couchette, said 

means being adapted to move them from their respective first 
position into their second position, and vice versa; 
means for locking in each of their respective 
positions the part (4) forming a support and the frame (6) 

of the bed or couchette; 
 
   said bed or couchette assembly being characterised 

in that the pivot axes (5,7) respectively of the part (4) 
forming a support on the recess (3) and of the frame (6) of  

 
the bed or couchette on said part (4) are parallel to the 

partition (2), and in that the means for controlling the 
movement of the part (4) forming a support comprise at least 

one actuator (8) accommodated inside the recess (3) and 
carried by the latter, the piston of said actuator (8) 

acting on a portion of said part (4) which is offset with 
respect to its pivot axis (5). 
An assembly according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the means for controlling the movement of the frame (6) 

of the bed or couchette comprise at least one actuator (9) 
carried by said frame and the piston of which acts on a 

portion of the latter which is offset with respect to its 
pivot axis (7). 
An assembly according to either claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the surface of the part (4) forming a 

support and visible from the outside in the retracted 
position comprises the same decoration as the ceiling (1) 

and is situated in the same plane as the latter.
