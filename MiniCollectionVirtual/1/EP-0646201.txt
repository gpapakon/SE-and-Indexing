<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for forming concrete pathways. The apparatus comprises a mold (10) incorporating a plurality of openings (14) for receiving concrete therein. The mold openings (14) define separate and distinct concrete cavities. Concrete pathways are formed by placing the mold (10) of the invention on a surface for receiving the concrete in the concrete cavities. Upon removal of the mold, the concrete segments retain the shape of the mold cavities and are slightly separated from each other. The procedure is repeated to form a pathway of a desired length and configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MOLD DEVICE FOR FORMING CONCRETE PATHWAYSBACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE The present invention is directed to an apparatus for forming concrete pathways, particularly, a plastic mold for configuring geometric designs for sidewalks, patios, gardens and the like.The formation of sidewalks or concrete pathways typically requires excavation of a pathway, the assembly of wooden or metal forms which normally are required to restrain the sides of the concrete after pouring and then disassembly of the wooden or metal forms once the concrete has cured. Thus, conventional concrete forming methods are costly both in terms of labor and materials. Concrete forming devices known in the prior art employ a mold to form the concrete to a desired shape. As the concrete begins to cure, the mold is removed and the next concrete member or section is formed. The use of such mold devices allows concrete sections of relatively uniform shape to be continuously formed having the cross-sectional configuration of the mold. Such prior art devices include U.S. Patent No. 2,893,098 to Tilley which discloses a mold for applying simulated masonry to walls and the exterior surfaces of buildings. U.S. Patent No. 3,600,773 to Davis discloses a concrete forming device of rather complex construction. A mold component of the device includes movable lower side edge portions which are resiliently biased downwardly to accommodate surface irregularities for confining the concrete in the mold. U.S. Patent No, 4,287,141 to Russell discloses an apparatus for forming embankments of trapezoidal shape. The trapezoidal-shaped shield apparatus is opened at the top and bottom, and rearwardly. Concrete is introduced into the top of the shield for forming each segment of the embankment.U.S. Patent 4,354,773 to Noack discloses a simulated interlocking stone paving block. The concrete paving blocks are formed with a mold. U.S. Patent No. 4,407,480 discloses a textured brick form. U.S. Patent 

No. 4,609,303 to Schumaker discloses an apparatus for forming concrete pathways. The apparatus continuously moves along the path as concrete is poured through a hopper extending upwardly from the top of the apparatus. As noted in U.S. Patent No. 4,609,303 a critical problem with prior art slip-forming devices used in the construction of concrete pathways is that the concrete that is discharged from such devices tends to crack or fracture. The tendency to crack during setting is particularly acute in applications requiring a concrete aggregate that contains an amount of

CLAIMS What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus for forming a concrete pathway, comprising a mold, said mold including perimeter sidewalls and a plurality of interconnecting members, wherein said sidewalls and said interconnecting members circumscribe a plurality of openings for forming separate concrete cavities and wherein said sidewalls and said interconnecting members further include rib members depending downwardly therefrom.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said mold is substantially square.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said openings are irregular in shape.
4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said openings are substantially identical in shape.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said rib members are substantially T-shaped in cross-section.
6. The apparatus of claim l wherein said perimeter sidewalls of said mold define an irregular profile.
7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said mold includes opposite sidewall members defining a profile which is the reverse of the, opposite sidewall members for interlinking different segments of the concrete pathway end to end.
