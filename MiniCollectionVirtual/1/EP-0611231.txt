<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method for transforming an 
input color space to an output color space where each of a 

plurality of specified colors and/or color regions are 
constrained to be transformed by any one of a plurality of 

explicitly specified color calibration or color enhancement 
strategies. The method involves a two step process: 

1) constraints are applied to some subset of the points in the 
input color space explicitly specifying the transform into the 

output color space; 2) the remainder of the points are then 
transformed by a mapping strategy which preserves color 

continuity. The mapping strategy used in the preferred 
embodiment is based on a computer graphics geometric morphing 

technique. In the preferred embodiment, multi-dimensional look-up 
tables are used to implement the color transformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of digital
image processing and more particularly to color calibration and
color enhancement for digital imaging systems. It consists of a
method for mapping colors in one color space to colors in
another color space. Explicit constraints are applied to
specify the color mapping for some subset of the colors.For color digital imaging systems, each step of the
imaging chain (original scene, image capture, image storage,
image transmission, soft display, hard copy display, etc.) will,
in general, have different color spaces, as well as different
color gamuts. Typical color spaces would include device-dependent
spaces such as RGB, CMY, and CMYK or device-independent
spaces such as CIE tristimulus (XYZ), CIELAB, and
CIELUV. The term color gamut is generally used to refer to the
range of colors which can be represented and/or displayed at
some particular stage in the system. The color gamut of a
display device may be quite different from the gamut of the
image capture device and/or the gamut of colors in some original
real world scene. Additionally, the gamut of colors which can
be displayed with one device may be substantially different from
the color gamut of some other device. For example, consider
Fig. 1 which illustrates the color gamut of a typical RGB color 
video monitor, as compared to the gamut of a Kodak XL7700 color
printer. The plot shows a slice through the gamuts in CIELAB
color space at a lightness value of L*=50.0. The area of
overlap for the two gamuts indicates the colors which can be
produced on both devices. The regions which are inside only one
of the curves represent colors which can be produced on one
device, but not on the other. The color values which are
outside both curves cannot be produced by either device. For
this example, it can be seen that the video monitor can produce
much more saturated blues than the thermal printer at this
lightness level, but the thermal printer, on the other hand, can
produce more saturated yellows.In many applications, it is necessary to take color
image data which exists in one color space and map it into a
different color space. Because of the differences in the color
spaces and the color gamuts of various devices, several problems
arise in this process. The first one is the matter of color
calibration. That is, how do you specify the color on one
device so that the perceived color matches that of another
device. For example, one might have an image which is displayed
on a video monitor and would then like

A method for transforming input color values in
an input color space (100) to output color values in an

output color space (102), comprising the steps of:

a) grouping color values (108) of an input color
space (100) according to common properties;
b) generating a color transform (110) for each of
the groups of step a);
c) generating a color transform (114) for any color
