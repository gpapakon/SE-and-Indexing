<ABSTRACT>
A dark level restoring circuit for a television 
receiver comprises a video signal source, a pedestal clamp 

circuit (2) connected to the video signal source and for clamping a 
pedestal portion of the video signal to a reference pedestal 

level, a first comparator (6) connected to the pedestal clamp 
circuit and for comparing the output of the pedestal clamp 

circuit and a reference dark level, a gain control amplifier (8) 
connected to the first comparator and for amplifying the output 

of the first comparator, a synthesizer (4) for synthesizing the 
outputs of the pedestal clamp circuit and the gain control 

amplifier, a dark peak hold circuit (12) connected to the synthesizer 
for holding the dark peak level, a second comparator (14) for 

comparing the output of the dark peak hold circuit and the 
reference pedestal level, the output of the second comparator 

controlling the gain of the gain control amplifier, a blanking 
signal source (10), a mute signal circuit for generating a mute 

signal (11) corresponding to a non-video signal portion when the 
effective raster size of the video signal is smaller than the 

size of a face plate of a cathode ray tube to which the video 
signal is supplied, and a logic circuit (9) for synthesizing the 

blanking signal and mute signal and for generating a control 
signal, the control signal controls the gain control amplifier 

such that the gain of the gain control amplifier is minimum and 
the dark peak hold circuit such that the holding operation of 

the dark peak hold circuit is inactive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dark level
restoring circuit for use with a television receiver.An example of a previous dark level restoring circuit
(U.S. Patent No. 4,631,589), on which the precharacterising
portion of appended claim 1 is based, will be described
below with reference to FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings.As shown in FIG. 1, a video signal applied to an input
terminal 1 from a video signal source (not shown) is supplied to
a pedestal clamp circuit 2, in which pedestal level of the input
video signal is clamped to reference pedestal level of a
reference voltage source 3. A video signal from the pedestal
clamp circuit 2 is supplied to a dark detector/dark expander
(dark level detector/dark level expander) 5 and a synthesizer
(adder) 4.The dark detector/dark expander 5 comprises a level
comparator 6 and a variable gain amplifier (gain controller) 8.
The video signal from the pedestal clamp circuit 2 is supplied
to the level comparator 6 which detects a dark level signal
portion below the reference dark level by comparing the level of
the video signal supplied thereto with reference dark level from
a reference voltage source 7. The dark level signal portion is
supplied to a variable gain amplifier (gain controller) 8, in
which the dark level signal portion is lowered and expanded. A
gain of the variable gain amplifier 8 is controlled in response 
to a compared output level from a level comparator 14 which will
be described later on.The dark level signal portion that had been expanded
by the variable gain amplifier 8 in the dark detector/dark
expander 5 is added to or replaced with the dark level signal
portion of the video signal clamped by the pedestal clamp
circuit 2 so that a video signal whose dark level portion is
expanded is output from an output terminal 13. This output
video signal is processed by some suitable video signal
processing means (not shown) and supplied to a cathode ray tube
(CRT), not shown. Simultaneously, this output video signal is
supplied to a dark peak hold circuit 12. The gain of the
variable gain amplifier 8 is optimized in response to the
addition or replacement of the dark level signal portion.The dark peak hold circuit 12 detects and holds the
dark peak level of the dark level signal portion of the video
signal supplied thereto from the adder 4. The dark peak level
held by the dark peak hold circuit 12 is supplied to the level
comparator 14, in which it is compared with the reference
pedestal level of the reference voltage source 3. A compared
output
