<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOUNDSThe present invention relates to compounds which are based on _f; anthπiquinone nucleus.The inhibition of DNA topoisomerases, particularly topoisomerase II (topo II) is now considered to be an important component in the mechanism of action of a large number of the most clinically active anticancer drugs presently available including doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, VP16, eamptolhecin. topυtecan. - i n AM SA , VM26 and the ellipiticines. These drugs are believed to inhibit topo II by stabilising a protein/drug/nucleic acid ternary complex termed the _avαble complex.However, whilst targeting topoisomerases, these drugs also exhibit a number 15 of oiher mechanisms of action, such as generation of free radicals and foπnation of DNA covalent adducts which contribute to their overall toxicitv and poor therapeutic index. Additionally, the failure of these agents to produce long term cures in the major malignancies is probably exacerbated by the presence of de novo resistance and the development of acquired drug resistance.20US-A-4 894 451 describes asymmetrically substituted anthracene- 1 ,4-dione compounds of Formula (A): 
(A)where B is a lower dialkyl amino group, n is 3-5 and R is hydrogen, alkanov l or alkylsulphonyl. These compounds were proposed for use against tumours. The present invention seeks to provide monosubstitυted compounds. At least where the left hand ring shown in Formula (A) is unsubstituted, this has not previously been possible.It is an object of this invention to provide improved clinically active drugs. It is a further object of the invention to provide coloured compounds useful as dyestuffs.In one aspect the invention provides a compound having the structural formula (I):( I )
where Y and Y1 are independently hydrogen or hydroxyl. β and B' are independently oxo or hydrogen, R5 is hydrogen or hydroxyl and X is the residue of an amino acid or a derivative of an amino acid, joined to the ring shown via the nitrogen atom of the amino acid adjacent the acid group thereof.Clearly, when B or B1 are oxo, the single line to the ring represents a double bond.By " amino acid" , we mean any compound having a groupRlR2 — C — NH-, where R1 is the residual group of an amino acid, Hfor example hydrogen, straight or branched Cl.β alkyl (such as methyl, iso- propyl, 2-methylpropyl or 1-methylpropyl), hydroxyalkyl (such as -CH2OH or 1-hydroxyethyl), aralkyl (such as benzyl or 4-hydroxy-benzyl), thiolalkyl (such as -CH2SH), alkylthioalkyl (such as -CH2CH2SCH3), acyl (such as -CH OOH or -CH2CH2COOH).
