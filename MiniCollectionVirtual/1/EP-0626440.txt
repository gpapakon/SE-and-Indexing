<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a stock oil pretreatment supply system adapted to supply heavy petroleum stock oil to a hydrogenator. 
In order to remove fine iron particles of not larger than 25 µ, which cannot be removed by the conventional techniques, from 

stock oil, a system consisting of a heater for heating the stock oil to a predetermined temperature by conducting heat exchange 
between the stock oil and a high-temperature hydrogenated oil at the bottom of a fractionating tower, a back washer-carrying solid 

filter for the heated stock oil, and a high-gradient magnetic separator for magnetically separating fine magnetic iron particles 
of not larger than 25 µ from the stock oil is formed, in which the bottom oil in the fractionating tower is used as a magnetic separator 

cleaning oil. The fine iron particles could be removed from the stock oil by repeating the iron removing operation and cleaning 
operation. This pretreatment supply system enables the iron particles, which cause a catalyst layer in the hydrogenator to be 

closed and deteriorated, to be reduced, and the length of time during which a conventional hydrogenator can be operated continuously 
to be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a novel
constitutional system for supplying a feed oil in a
hydrogenation apparatus such as a hydrodesulfurization
apparatus, a hydrocracking apparatus and the like of
petroleum heavy oils. Particularly, the present
invention relates to a supply system for pre-treating a
feed oil containing magnetic iron fine particles.Fine particles composed of a small amount of
iron or iron compounds are generally contained in a
petroleum heavy oil. These fine particles come to be
contained in the above petroleum heavy oil as fine
particles and the like peeled off from tanks, pipelines
and a distillation apparatus owing to corrosion of them
when a crude oil is transported from an area of
production by a tanker, stored in a tank and fed to the
distillation apparatus through pipelines. When such a
petroleum heavy oil, particularly a petroleum heavy
residual oil is used as a feed oil in a fixed bed
hydrogenation apparatus (hydrodesulfurization or
hydrocracking apparatus), a fine particulate iron 
component contained in the feed oil deposits on a
catalyst or between catalyst particles to clog the
reactor thereby increasing pressure drop or to reduce
activity of the catalyst particles. Clogging of the
reactor increases pressure drop and deflects the feed
oil to reduce its flow rate and sometimes to shut down
operation of the apparatus. Deterioration of the
catalyst is required to replace the catalyst, resulting
in a significant loss for the operation of the
hydrogenation apparatus.In general, in petroleum refining industry, a
filter for solid materials is usually provided in a raw
material oil feeding line in order to remove solid
impurities contained in the oil. The conventional
filter is to prevent damage of a pump and the like, and
it can separate solid materials having a large particle
size by filtering, but can not separate to remove fine
particles of the order of microns as described later.
These fine particles are considered to be fine
particles composed of iron compounds as mentioned above
and have been become a main factor for obstructing the
operation of the hydrogenation apparatus. In order to
remove these fine particles, it has been attempted that
a filter paper and a membrane filter having a fine mesh
are used as a filter or a centrifugal separator is
used. The above filter, however, causes great pressure 
drop and also rapid clogging so that it cannot be used
practically for a long time. Even if the filter part
is replaced, the replacement is required to be often
conducted so
