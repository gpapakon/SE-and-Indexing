<ABSTRACT>
A water-dispersible polyisocyanate preparation obtained by urethanisation of some of the isocyanate groups of 2,4- and/or 2,6-diisocyanatotoluene using mono- and polyhydric alcohols, a process for their preparation by reacting a polyisocyanate component A) based on the 2,4- and/or 2,6-diisocyanatotoluene and containing urethane groups with monohydric polyether alcohols B) containing ethylene oxide units, an aqueous two-component coating composition containing, as binder, a combination of such a polyisocyanate preparation with a water-soluble or -dispersible polyhydroxyl component, and the use of such a coating composition for the production of coatings on sheet-like, water-resistant substrates.
