from another. The present invention also relates
to methods for producing such devices. Optical
functional devices include light emitting
devices, light detecting devices, optical
waveguides, spot-size converters, wavelength

etc. Making the most of their wide band and
high directivity, semiconductor light emitting
devices can be used widely and are applicable to
light sources for optical measurement, integrated
light sources, wavelength-tunable light sources,
light sources for optical communication, etc.
For example, semiconductor light emitting devices

semiconductor integrated optical devices which
can be used in optical processing such as optical
information processing and optical switching and
more particularly to an optical integrated device

integrated circuit which includes a semiconductor
substrate having arranged thereon a plurality of
optical functional devices such as a light
emitting device, an optical waveguide, and a
light detecting device and which enables
processing of many optical communication signals

urgent necessity to develop optical functional
