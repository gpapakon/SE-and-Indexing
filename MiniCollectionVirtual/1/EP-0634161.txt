<ABSTRACT>
A hair dye consisting of a hair resisting antibody fixed by a coloring material of a high bulk factor, in which 
the coloring material is composed of an inorganic pigment, water-soluble coloring matter or water-insoluble coloring 

matter, or possibly a complex of these coloring substances and a macromolecular support. Since this hair dye gives 
an excellent and fast color to hair uniquely, the skin is neither contaminated nor stimulated, and the feel and texture 

of hair are improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hair dyes which 
are excellent in coloring, are resistant in color 
fading, do not produce color on skin because of their 
specific affinity to hair, do not irritate skin and 
improve the tactile properties of hair. For the past years, various methods of dyeing 
hair have been known in the art. In one of conventional 
methods, oxidative dyes are permeated into hair in an 
alkaline condition, treated with oxidizing agents such 
as hydrogen peroxide or the like and then are 
polymerized within hair for developing color. 
Alternatively, acid dyes are permeated into the hair for 
dyeing. There is also another temporary coloring method 
in which coloring matter or pigment is adhered or fixed 
to hair using binders for developing colors. However, those methods are known to have various 
disadvantages. For example, oxidation dyes pose 
problems such as damaged hair due to dyeing treatment,  
 
allergic effects and irritation to skin, especially to 
mucus and eye. Although less irritate to skin, the acid 
dyes are often not satisfactory in finish and 
disadvantageous in losing color when hair is washed. 
Skin is sometimes stained by dyes when hair is dyed. 
The temporary coloring method does not provide a good 
tactile property because of stickiness, brittleness or 
the like of applied binders. In addition, resistance to 
abrasion is generally not sufficient in this method. Recently, antibodies have been used as 
cosmetics. For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Application No. 4-29912 discloses a method in which 
antibodies are modified with functional molecules of 
dyes, perfumes, humectants and the like, and then said 
functional molecules are transferred together with the 
antibodies to the desired place on account of 
specificity of the antibodies. However, no testing is described about hair dyes 
in the above patent application though there is a 
description to the effect that an antibody modified with 
phycopyrine protein (a fluorescent substance corresponding 
to a water-soluble natural dye) was applied to skin 
in an example of the above patent. In addition, according 
to the above-mentioned method, there exist such 
problems that sufficient amounts of dyes required to 
color hair are hardly immobilized on the antibody and  
 
that too much load of the dyes may inactivate the 
antibody. Thus, this method cannot be put into 
practice. On the other hand, a method has been known in 
which antibody-modified pigments are used as diagnostic 
reagents. However, in this method
