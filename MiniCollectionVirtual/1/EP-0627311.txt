<ABSTRACT>
The general purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for cooling a hot web. In this method, liquid is applied to one side or to both sides of a hot web (16) by means of liquid applicator rollers (24,28) located on opposite sides of a web (16) running through, this taking place after a web has run through a dryer (14). The web is cooled as a result of the evaporation of the liquid on one or on both sides of the web. According to one version of the present invention, a housing (12) is provided next to a dryer (14), a hot web running through the dryer and the housing. This housing (12) comprises a pressure roller (20), a support roller (22), liquid applicator rollers (24,28) and a cooling roller (31), the web (16) running over all these rollers.

<CLAIMS>
Device for cooling a printed material web heated
in the dryer of a web-fed rotary printing machine,


having a supporting roll or turning device (22, 78,
186), which is arranged downstream of the dryer (14,

50, 152, 242, 252) and guides the printed material

web (16, 52, 174, 244, 254, 264, 276),
having a second roll (31, 92, 188), which is
arranged downstream of the supporting roll or

turning device (22, 78, 186) and guides the printed
material web (16, 52, 174, 244, 254, 264, 276),
having a first liquid application roll (24, 84, 190)
for the application of liquid to a first side of the

printed material web (16, 52, 174, 244, 254, 264,
276),
having a second liquid application roll (31, 86,
192) for the application of liquid to a second side

of the printed material web (16, 52, 174, 244, 254,
264, 276),

the liquid application rolls (24, 84, 190; 28, 86,
192) being arranged on mutually opposite sides of

the printed material web (16, 52, 174, 244, 254,
264, 276), between the supporting roll or turning

device and the second roll (22, 78, 186; 31, 92,
188),

characterized in that the liquid application rolls (24,
84, 190; 28, 86, 192) are together assigned to a section

of the printed material web that extends between the
supporting roll or turning device and the second roll

(22, 78, 186; 31, 92, 188) and are arranged offset with
respect to each other and exert pressure contact on the 

printed material web, along a contact area, in such a way
that wetting of the printed material web surface is

effected.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the supporting roll or turning device and the second

roll (22, 78, 186; 31, 92, 188) can be cooled.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that liquid-filled troughs (27, 214; 33,

224) into which the liquid application rolls (24, 84,
190; 28, 86, 192) dip, at least partly, are provided.
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that means which regulate the liquid level in the troughs

(27, 214; 33, 224) are provided.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the liquid applied is cooled.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the liquid application rolls (24,

84, 190; 28, 86, 192) are driven by motors (32, 34).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the liquid application rolls (24,

84, 190; 28, 86, 192) rotate in a direction counter to
the direction of movement of the printed material web

(16, 52, 174, 244, 254, 264, 276).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the rotational speed of the liquid

application rolls (24, 84, 190; 28, 86, 192) is a fixed
percentage of the printed web speed.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that at least the circumferential

surface of one of the liquid application rolls (24, 84,
190; 28, 86, 192) has a surface structure, preferably an

etched pattern, that is beneficial to the transfer of
liquid to the printed material web.
