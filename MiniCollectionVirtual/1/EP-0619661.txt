<ABSTRACT>
A switching unit (1) for the through-connection of different types of digital data using the asynchronous transfer method, known as an ATM switch, is intended to be tested in order to ascertain whether it is capable of handling a specified load. The device provides return paths (4) from outputs (2) to inputs (3) via which basic load data cells, fed in by a generator (5) at one input (35), circulate continuously on the basis of their routing data. The generator (5) also emits test cells. A discriminator (6) is inserted in the return path (41) at a measuring output (21). It is capable of reading, modifying, copying or suppressing specific data cell contents. It feeds the cells back and/or via a second output to an analyser (7) which statistically evaluates them. The method provides for data cells to be fed in successively and in controlled fashion in a first stage until a specific basic load is attained, and for the basic load to be modulated in a second stage by diverting individual cells and superimposing test cells. Instabilities occurring as a result of overload can thus immediately be brought back under control.
