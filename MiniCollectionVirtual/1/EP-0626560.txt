<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for measuring a 
transversal section (4) of a longitudinally-laid 

body (5) translating in a longitudinal direction. 
Two first rigid and straight support elements (13, 

14) lie and intersect on a measuring plane (6), 
each of which support elements (13, 14) bears on a 

longitudinal side facing the body (5) a plurality 
(15, 16) of light sources (17, 18) aligned along 

longitudinal axes (11, 12) of the support elements 
(13, 14) and each emits a light beam (19) in a 

direction lying on the measuring plane (6) and 
perpendicular to the axes (11, 12) of the support 

elements (13, 14). Successive single light beams 
(19) are emitted in a perpendicular direction by 

each light source (17, 18) according to a sequence 
corresponding to an alignment of the light sources 

(17, 18). Two second support elements (23, 24) lie 
on the measuring plane (6) of the transversal 

section (4), each of which second support elements 
(23, 24) bears a plurality (25, 26) of light 

sensors (27, 28) picking up the light beam (19) 
emitted from each of the light sources (17, 18),  

 
according to a real configuration of the 

transversal section (4) to be measured as well as

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for measuring a
transversal section of a longitudinally-laid
object able to translate in a longitudinal
direction. The device is applicable especially in
sawmills, where automatic and speedy measurement
of lumber size is necessary during their transport
to the sawing stations so that they can be sorted
into groups of similar size, or so that the saw
machinary can be adapted to receive them.Devices of this type act in a fixed plane of a
generic transversal section, arranged
perpendicular to the trunk advancement direction.The measuring operation is continually repeated
during the trunk movement so that a certain number
of transversal measurements are obtained of a same
trunk.The measurement is taken by exploiting optical
phenomena, where the trunk is invested sideways by
light beams emitted by a light source and read by
light sensor. The prior art teaches various different devices
for this purpose. A first of these comprises two
equal units arranged perpendicular to each other.
Each unit exhibits a group of light sources and
sensors to read the luminous radiations emitted by
the light sources. The body which section is to be
measured is located between the light-sensor
groups, and constitutes an obstacle for a part of
the light beam emitted by the light sources, so
that only a part of the light beams can be picked
up and read by the sensors.The real configuration of the section is
approximated to a circle, which diameter is equal
to a distance between the two most internal
sensors that have sensed the light beam. By
calculating a mean of the two circles obtained
using the two groups, an approximate transversal
section of the body is derived.The principal drawback of such a device is that it
requires a large number of sensors, in order that
an ideal straight light conjoining a light source
with its respective sensor can be as tangential as
possible to the real silhouette of the section:
thus the device tends to be costly.A further drawback is the excessive maintenance 
needed, especially so as to keep the constituent
elements clean, as they are constantly exposed and
close to the dirty tree trunks.A second device, like the above-described first
device, provides a light source and an exactly
opposite rank of light sensors, which the body to
be measured is placed between.Differently from the above case, a lens is
situated between the sensors and the object. This
lens collects the light rays emitted by the lamp
which are not blocked by the body and sends them
towards the
