<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a process for the
production of trifluorovinyl ethers, comprising: 
a) reacting a compound containing the group
-O(C2F4)COF or the group -O(C2F4)C(O)O(O)C(C2F4)O- with a
siloxane;b) heating the silyl ester in the presence of a
thermolysis catalyst, at a temperature of about 140°C to
about 350°C to produce a trifluorovinyl ether and a
fluorosilane; provided that where b) is carried out in
the gas phase, said thermolysis catalyst is not a diaryl
sulfone.This invention includes a process for the
production of silyl esters, comprising, reacting a
compound of the formula R1[O(C2F4)COF]z or a compound of
the formula R1[O(C2F4)C(O)O(O)C(C2F4)O]zR1 with a
siloxane, to form a silyl ester, and wherein:
R1is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl
radical having z free valencies; andzis 1 or 2.This invention also concerns a process for the
production of a trifluorovinyl ether, comprising,
heating a silyl ester of the formula
R1[O (C2F4)C(O)OSiR23]z, in the presence of a thermolysis
catalyst, at a temperature of about 140°C to about
350°C, to produce a trifluorovinyl ether and a
fluorosilane, and wherein;
R1is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl
radical having z free valencies;each R2is independently hydrocarbyl, substituted
hydrocarbyl or an oxysilyl group; andzis 1 or 2;
provided that when carried out in the gas phase said
thermolysis catalyst is not a diaryl sulfone.This invention also includes a silyl ester of the
formula R1[O(C2F4)C(O)OSiR33]z, wherein:
R1is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl
radical having z free valencies; each R3is independently hydrocarbyl, substituted
hydrocarbyl, or oxysilyl; andzis 1 or 2; and
provided that when z is 1, all hydrogen atoms in
R1 are replaced by fluorine.This invention deals with a process for producing
trifluorovinyl ethers from selected acyl fluorides or
carboxylic anhydrides. The process involves two steps,
each of which is novel, and a novel intermediate is
involved. The chemical reactions are believed to be:
-O(C2F4)COF + ≡SiOSi≡ → -O(C2F4)C(O)OSi≡ + ≡SiF-O(C2F4)C(O)O(O)C(C2F4)O- + ≡SiOSi≡ → 2 -O(C2F4)C(O)OSi≡-O(C2F4)C(O)OSi≡ → -OCF=CF2 + CO2 + ≡SiF
Reaction conditions and catalysts are not shown in these
equations, and in the complete process, either reaction
(1) or reaction (2) would be done, followed by reaction
(3). In these equations, only the "essential" parts of
the reactants are shown. By "essential" is meant those
parts of the reacting compounds that undergo chemical
change during the process.The (parts of) the compounds
