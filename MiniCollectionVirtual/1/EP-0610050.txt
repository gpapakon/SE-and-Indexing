<ABSTRACT>
Digital tilt level sensing probe system comprising a set of 
multiple capacitor elements (8,11) in a fluid container arranged along an 

axis of measurement where each multiple capacitor element (8,11) 
represents a discrete level increment in dielectric material fluid to be 

measured. Individual capacitors (8,11) in each element are horizontally 
spaced to reflect a level differential upon tilting of the fluid 

container from its normal attitude. In the case of a probe for sensing 
tilting in a single plane, a one-piece body (10) is employed to include 

integral capacitor element (8,11), mounting pad (14), connector (13), 
custom IC pad (15) and circuitry molded into such body (10). Alternative 

references may be employed for comparison with each capcitor assigned a 
unique time slot in a switching sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. Patent 5,138,880 discloses a digital level sensing probe system including
digital probe constructed of two (2) concentric cylinders, forming a set of discrete,
cylindrical capacitors that use the substance whose level is to be measured as a dielectric
material. The set of capacitors is arranged along the axis of measurement where each
capacitor represents a discrete level increment. Each capacitor is assigned a unique time
slot in a switching sequence. The first level capacitor is used as a reference to which all
other capacitors are sequentially compared. In the switching sequence, an AC signal is
applied across each capacitor and compared with the inverted signal which is applied
across the first level capacitor. A logic "1" results when the substance is present and a
logic "0" when the substance is absent. The logic is decoded and converted to display the
appropriate quantity of substance measured.The possibility of mounting printed circuit configurations printed in the flat
and mounted in facing relation on flat support elements with appropriate aligned spacing
is mentioned in such Patent.The use of individual isolated capacitors arranged along the axis of
measurement, where each capacitor represents a discrete level increment checked
sequentially in a unique time slot switching sequence for presence or absence of fluid,
provides marked advance in accuracy compared to analog probes which depend on variable
dielectric values proportional to wetted level of the probe; also compared to semi-isolated
capacitors employing a common electrode.For further refinement of accuracy, it has been found desirable to compensate
for tilting of the fluid container when the probe is offset from the geometrical center; also
to accommodate situations where the first fluid level may have a different dielectric value
from the higher level fluid which may impair its qualification as a reference, as in the case
of condensation creating a water level under the principal gasoline, oil or other fluid to be 
measured. In order to accommodate the possibility of a different first level fluid,
alternative references are disclosed herein which are not subject to first fluid level
variations.By separating discrete level capacitors into plural individual isolated
capacitors in each plane of measurement with the container in normal attitude, the sensing
of differential presence and absence of fluid at the individual capacitors of each level, may
be employed as an indicator of tilting and programmed to compensate for fluid volume
