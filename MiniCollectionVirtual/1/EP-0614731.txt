<ABSTRACT>
The tool for insertion into a tool chuck for handtools which are used for chiselling, rotary drilling and/or rotary percussion drilling has a clamping shank (A) with two axially closed locking grooves (1), two rotary driving grooves (2) which are axially open towards the free end of the clamping shank (A), and two rotary driving faces (3).

<CLAIMS>
Tool for insertion into a tool chuck for chiselling, rotary drilling 
and/or percussion drilling hand tools, comprising a circular 

clamping shaft (A, B, C, D) having at least one axially sealed 
locking groove (1, 11, 21, 31), at least one rotary pickup 

groove (2, 12, 22, 32) which is axially open towards the free 
end, and at least in the peripheral area of the locking groove 

(1, 11, 21, 31) a rotary pickup surface (3, 13, 23, 33) which is 
open towards the free end of the clamping shaft (A, B, C, D) 

and extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the clamping 
shaft (A, B, C, D), 
characterised in that
 the locking groove (1, 
11, 21, 32) and the rotary pickup surface (3, 13, 23, 33) have 

in the longitudinal direction of the clamping shaft coinciding 
symmetry planes. 
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rotary 
pickup surface (3) is designed to be plane. 
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rotary 
pickup surface (13) is designed to be convex. 
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rotary 
pickup surface (23) is designed to be concave. 
Tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the rotary 
pickup surface (33) is composed of two surface sections (33a, 

33b) which extend rooflike relative to each other. 
Tool according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the vertex of 
both surface sections (33a, 33b) lies on the circumference of 

the clamping shaft (D). 
Tool according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the vertex 

angle (W) lies between 120° and 150°. 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 
the clamping shaft (A, B, C, D) comprises two locking grooves 

(1, 11, 21, 31) which are positioned diametrally opposite each 
other and two rotary pickup surfaces (3, 13, 23, 33).  

 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 
the length (L) of the rotary pickup surface (3, 13, 23, 33) is 

greater than the length (V) of the locking groove (1, 11, 21, 
31). 
Tool chuck for tools according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
comprising a circular receiving aperture as well as at least one 

rotary pickup ledge (4) for a rotary pickup groove (2) and with 
at least one radially transposable locking element (5) for a 

locking groove (1), 
characterised in that
 the receiving 
aperture has in the area of the locking body (5) at least one 

counter-surface (6) for the rotary pickup surface (3) of the tool, 
and that the locking element (5) and the counter-surface (6) 

have in the longitudinal direction of the receiving aperture 
coinciding symmetry planes. 
Tool chuck according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the 
counter-surface (6) is designed to be plane. 
Tool chuck according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the 
counter-surface is designed to be concave. 
Tool chuck according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the 
counter-surface is designed to be convex. 
Tool chuck according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the 
counter-surface is composed of two surface sections which 

extend rooflike relative to each other.
