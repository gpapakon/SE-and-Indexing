<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed toward a fibrous web having 
improved strength characteristics which, in the presence of water, rapidly 

disintegrates when subjected to standardized agitation testing. The web 
includes a plurality of fibers joined together by a binder. The binder 

makes up from about 0.20 to about 15 percent of the dry weight of the 
web. The binder is formed from a blend of from about 10 to about 40 

weight percent of a water dispersible polymer; from about 10 to about 40 
weight percent of an elastomeric latex emulsion; from about 20 to about 

40 weight percent of a xerogellant; and from about 5 to about 20 weight 
percent of a plasticizing agent. The fibrous web is useful in the formation 

of disposable diapers and feminine care products which may be flushed 
down the toilet.

<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. patent application serial number 07/997,797 entitled 
"Hydrodisintegratable Material and Products Formed Thereby" filed on 
December 29, 1992 in the names of Messers. Cohen, Jameson and 
Isaac and U.S. patent application serial number 08/046,064 entitled 
"Self Sealing Film" filed on April 12, 1993 in the names of Messers. 
Isaac, Cohen and Jameson. The field of the present invention is that of binder compositions for 
use in the formation of coherent fibrous web materials which have the 
ability to rapidly fall apart or disintegrate into a collection of generally 
individual fibers in an aqueous medium when subjected to agitation. For many years the problem of disposability has plagued the 
industries which provide disposable diapers, incontinent garments and 
feminine care products. While much headway has been made in 
addressing this problem, one of the weak links has been the inability to 
create an economical coherent fibrous web which will readily dissolve 
or disintegrate in water. See, for example, U.K. patent disclosure 
2,241,373 and U.S. Patent Number 4,186,233. Without such a product, 
the ability of the user to dispose of the product by flushing it down the 
toilet is greatly reduced if not eliminated. Furthermore, the ability of the 
product to disintegrate in a landfill is quite limited because a large 
portion of the components of the product, which may well be 
biodegradable or photodegradable, are encapsulated in plastic which 
degrades over a long period of time, if at all. Accordingly, if the plastic  
 
at least disintegrated in the presence of water, the internal components 
could degrade as a result of the rupture of the plastic encapsulation. In prior U.S. patent application serial number 07/997,797 entitled 
"Hydrodisintegratable Material and Products Formed Thereby" which 
was filed on December 29, 1992, a composition is described which has 
the ability to disintegrate in the presence of water. Thin material can be 
used to form plastic films which disintegrate in the presence of water. 
However, those in the art have also been searching for a fibrous 
material or web (as compared to a film) which has the ability to 
disintegrate in the presence of water. Disposable diapers, feminine care products and adult incontinent 
care products generally usually have a body side liner which must 
rapidly pass fluids such as, for example, urine or menses, so that the 
fluid may be absorbed by the absorbent core of the product. Typically, 
the body side liner is a cohernet fibrous web
