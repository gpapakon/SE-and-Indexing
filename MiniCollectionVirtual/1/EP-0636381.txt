<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a disposable 
syringe construction including a retractable or with-drawing 

needle (3), which comprises a cylindric body (1) defining, 
at one end thereof, an end piece (2) for the 

connection of the needle (3), and being open, at the 
other end thereof, for receiving a piston (4) therein, 

provided with a sealing gasket (5). 
The main feature of the invention is that 
the end piece (2) is provided in its inside with a cut-out (10) 

for coupling with abutment legs (14) of a hub element (11) 
to which the point (16) of the needle (3) is connected, 

an outer collar (20) being moreover provided, which can 
be applied to the end of the end piece (2) so as to prevent 

the hub (11) and related needle (3) to be outwardly 
ejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable 
syringe construction provided with a retractable 
or withdrawable needle. As is known, a very important problem in 
making disposable syringes is that of providing a 
possibility of re-using said syringes and that of 
preventing the needle from accidentally injuring 
an user handling the needle syringe. Prior solutions to solve the above mentioned 
problem usually provide to use syringes including 
resilient means for causing the syringe needle to 
be retracted inside the syringe. These types of syringes, however, in addition 
to being very expensive, have the drawback 
that they involve a modification of the conventional 
use method of the syringes, since, as a puncture 
is performed thereby, it is anyhow usually necessary 
to overcome a resilient opposing force. Other prior solutions, which do not provide 
to use resilient means, comprise connecting elements 
for coupling the needle to the syringe body, which 
connecting elements, however, do not provide a safe 
locking of the needle in its intended position and,  
 
moreover, being very complex from a construction standpoint. WO-A-9112842 discloses a protection assembly for an 
injection syringe, comprising a piston 17 having a 
cavity 18 formed in its end face. Said cavity can engage 
claws 19 of a needle foot 20 of the syringe, the claws 
19 then being bent and latching lugs 21 being released 
and the foot 20 being unlatched. EP-A-0321903 describes a syringe having a needle 
which can be retracted within the barrel section. Means 
are provided for cocking the needle as it is retracted 
into the barrel.  
 Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, 
by providing a disposable syringe contruction, including 
a retractable needle, which affords the 
possibility of causing the needle to be easily withdrawn 
inside the syringe body, without the need of 
using return springs, while also providing the possibili 
ty of safely locking the needle in its intended use 
position. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide such a disposable syringe construction affording 
the possibility of causing the needle to 
be withdrawn inside the syringe by using very simple 
and mechanically reliable means. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a disposable syringe construction 
which can be made by very simple component elements, 
thereby providing great economic advantages. Yet another object of

<CLAIMS>
A disposable syringe construction, provided 
with a retractable needle, comprising: a cylindric body (1) 

defining, at an end portion thereof, an end-piece (2) for 
connecting a needle (3) and being open, at another end 

portion thereof; a piston (4) provided with a plunger and 
introduced into said cylindric body through the open 

end portion thereof; a needle (3) coupled to a hub (11) provided 
with resiliently contracting lugs (12,13) with abutment legs (14) 

removably engaging with a cut-out (10) defined inside said 
end-piece, said piston being 

provided, at an end portion thereof facing said needle, 
with a blind hole (30) closed by a locking collar (31), 

said locking collar, as it is engaged 
with said hub, causing said lugs to be contracted so as 

to disengage said abutment legs from said cut-out, 
an outer collar (20) being 

moreover provided to be applied on an end-portion of 
said end-piece and forming an upset portion on the end 

of said end piece so as to prevent said hub and related 
needle from being outwardly ejected, characterised in that a locking 

tooth (32) is provided on only one of said 
lugs for engagement with said locking collar to  

 
cause said needle to be arranged with a slanted 

arrangement with respect to the axis of said cylindric 
body as said piston is withdrawn so as to prevent said 

needle from reemerging. 
A syringe according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that said hub is provided with an axial hole in  

 
which the tip of the needle is engaged, and in that 

said lugs comprise a pair of opposite lugs, provided 
with said legs defining a substantially 90Â° coupling 

with said cut-out. 
A syringe according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said piston is 

provided, at an intermediate portion of its rod, with 
notches adapted to allow an end portion of said piston 

to be broken.
