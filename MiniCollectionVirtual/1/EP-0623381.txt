<ABSTRACT>
A first MFC 10 and a second MFC 10A are disposed respectively on a silane 
gas feed line 5 and an inert gas or other dilution gas feed line 19 for feeding a gas 

for semiconductors such as silane gas or an inert gas or other dilution gas to a 
mixing chamber 13. A buffer tank 21 is provided which restrains or relieves the 

pressure energy of the mixed gas coming from the mixing chamber 13 and 
supplies the same mixed gas to each of a plurality of semiconductor manufacturing 

units 4 separately. The first MFC 10 and second MFC 10A are actuated to open 
or close on the basis of an increase or decrease in the pressure value of the mixed 

gas stored in the buffer tank 21, thereby stopping or starting the feed of the silane 
gas and the inert gas or other dilution gas again.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mixed gas supply system which can supply
a mixed gas stable in concentration to a plurality of semiconductor manufacturing
units by means of one mixer.In the manufacture of semiconductors, a mixed gas (or gas mixture) plays a
very important role together with pure water and chemicals. A mixed gas supply
system in the prior art has been devised to supply a mixed gas which is a special
material gas to each of a plurality of semiconductor manufacturing units 4
separately, as shown in Fig. 5.One end of a mixed gas supply line 1 is connected to the plurality of said
semiconductor manufacturing units (designated by M in Fig. 5) 4, respectively.
To the other end of this mixed gas supply line 1 are connected two cylinders 2 for
normal use and auxiliary use which store a mixed gas (not shown), respectively.This cylinder 2 is designed and constructed with high performance, which is
at fist filled with silane gas (SiH4 gas) with a purity of 100% at a volume of 5%,
and secondarily filled with highly pure nitrogen gas (N2 gas) or the like which is a
dilution gas at a volume of 95%.In the viewpoint of weighing the weight of these feed gases accurately when
they are filled, a balance (not shown) is used each time. After the silane gas and nitrogen gas or the like, as the feed gases, are filled
in turn, the cylinder 2 is shaken and the aforementioned mixed gas is prepared by
virtue of a mixing action accompanied with this shaking operation of the cylinder
2. Then, the purity of the thus-prepared mixed gas is strictly checked, thereby
determining whether the cylinders 2 pass the inspection one by one. Two of only
the cylinders 2 which have passed the inspection are stored in each of a plurality
of cylinder cabinets (designated by C/C in Fig. 5) 3.Each of the cylinder cabinets 3 holds the two cylinders 2 for normal use and
auxiliary use, and further contains an air-tightness checking gas intake line and
vent line (not shown), and they are installed in alienation from a use point. The
number of the cylinder cabinets 3 to be installed corresponds to that of the
semiconductor manufacturing units 4.Thus, the two cylinders 2 for normal use and auxiliary use which have passed
the inspection are stored in each of the plurality of said cylinder cabinets 3, and
they will supply the mixed gas separately to each of the plurality of said
semiconductor manufacturing units 4 via the mixed gas supply line 1.The mixed gas supply system of the prior art having the aforementioned
structure is very

<CLAIMS>
A process to supply a gas mixture comprising the steps of:

providing a source of dilution gas selected from the group conisting of an
inert gas and hydrogen;
providing a source of pure gas selected from the group conisting of gases
useful in the manufacture of semi conductors;
flowing said dilution and pure gases to mixing means in order to make a
diluted gas mixture;
storing the diluted gas mixture in buffer tank means characterized in that it
further comprises the steps of :
supplying said diluted gas mixture to a least one semi conductor
manufacturing unit;
controlling the pressure of the gas mixture in the buffer tank means;
flowing said dilution gas and pure gas through first and second valve means,
respectively wherein the first and second valve means are respectively closed to stop

the flow of the dilution gas and the flow of the pure gas when the pressure inside the
buffer tank means has reached a high predetermined pressure value;
wherein the first and second valve means are opened when the
pressure inside the buffer tank means has reached a low predetermined pressure

value.

and wherein back up means of diluted gas mixture
is provided, said back-up means being activated when an abnormality of flow rate of

any gas is detected.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the dilution gas is provided as a
liquid which is evaported, said liquefied gas being preferably liquid nitrogen, liquid

argon, liquid hydrogen or liquid helium.
A process according to one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the pure gas is
preferably silane.
