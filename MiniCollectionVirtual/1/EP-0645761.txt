<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a cylinder
motor apparatus which rotates a rotating member by utilizing
a rotor and a stator, and also to a magnetic
recording or reproducing apparatus utilizing the cylinder
motor apparatus.In recent years, magnetic recording or reproducing
apparatus,such as video tape recorders, digital audio tape
recorders, for recording on or reproducing from
magnetic tapes through rotary heads have rapidly come into
wide use in home. To address demands for low-profile
equipment, some of these devices have a cylinder
motor apparatus to rotate a rotor mounted to the rotary head
shaft of the cylinder by a fixed stator core assembly.FIGURE 1 shows a cross-sectional view illustrating a
known cylinder motor apparatus and its peripheral
members.In FIGURE 1, reference numeral 51 denotes a chassis. On
the chassis 51, there is defined a hole 52 into which a
cylinder motor apparatus 61 is inserted.On one side of the chassis 51, a cylinder 54 is mounted
by a fastener 53 at a predetermined angle. A through-hole 55
is defined through the center of the cylinder 54. A shaft 56
with a rotary head mounted on its one end is inserted into
the through-hole 55 from one end of the cylinder 54. A ball 
bearing 57 is provided between the inner surface of the
through-hole 55 and the shaft 56 so that the shaft 56 is
able to rotate against the cylinder 54 at a low load condition.There is a step 58 provided at the end of the
cylinder 54. The outer cylindrical wall of the step 58 is
fittedto a central opening of a cylinder-contained circuit
board 62, while the flat surface of the step 58 is contact
with the one side of a cylinder-contained circuit board 62 at
a portion around the central opening. There is a stator core
assembly 64 provided on the other side of the cylinder-contained
circuit board 62 via a spacer 63. The stator core
assembly 64, the spacer 63 and the cylinder-contained circuit
board 62 are fixed around the step 58 of the cylinder 54 by
screws 65. A coil 66 is wound around the stator core
assembly 64.At the end of the shaft 56, a rotor 67 is mounted.
The rotor 67 is provided on its one side with an edge 68
which encircles the stator core assembly 64. A magnet 69 is
mounted on a predetermined position of the edge 68. The
magnet 69 has such a shape that a notch 70 fits to the edge
68 so that a magnetic field is generated over the inside and
the outside of the edge 68. A circular fastener 71 is
provided around the shaft 56 on one side of the rotor 67 to
stably hold the rotor 67 against the
