<ABSTRACT>
Simulator for an EDM method in which a computer program replaces the manufacture of special-shape tool electrodes and in which a three-dimensional cavity or relief is machined by high-speed erosion of the successive incremental layers of material by virtue of a tool electrode whose shape is simple and independent of the cavity to be eroded. It calculates the theoretical take-off of material along the path programmed for the tool, programs the appropriate machining rates at each point on this path and sends the corresponding signals to the numerical-control unit which controls the relative three-dimensional movement between the tool electrode and the workpiece to be eroded. The simulator according to the present invention interacts with computer means in order to determine a path for the tool electrode such that its tip scans, groove by groove, each successive layer; it also interacts with a wear compensator intended for programming an additional axial advance of the tool, this advance being intended to compensate continuously for its longitudinal wear so as to keep its active end parallel to the plane of the layer to be eroded.
