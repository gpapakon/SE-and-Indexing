<ABSTRACT>
A disposable sterile apparatus (1) for blood filtration with 
a system for the optimization of blood recovery in the 

passage from one pouch to the next, comprising a main tube 
(4, 8, 13, 18, 19) containing sterile air, one end of which 

is designed for the connection to a first container (pouch) 
(2) containing the liquid to be filtered and the other end of 

which is connected to a second empty container (pouch) (20). 
The foregoing tube (4, 8, 13, 18, 19) includes at least one 

filter (12) being arranged in the flow of the liquid. 
The novelty consists in that the apparatus (1) contains a 
tube (7) for the return of air from said second container 

(20) to said first container (2) acting to equalize pressure 
of the liquid at the two extremities of the self-same main 

tube (4, 8, 13, 18, 19) which includes at least one filter 
(12) after the liquid has been filtered. The air return line 

(7) further comprises a one-way or check valve (7a) which 
permits the passage of air from the second (20) to the first 

container (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a disposable sterile apparatus
for the filtration of blood with a system for optimizing the
recovery of blood in the passage from one container (pouch)
to another.The use of pre-assembled lines, designated tube sets, for
single use to assure the sterility of the assembly for the
filtration of blood contained in one pouch to a second empty
pouch is now consolidated in the medical equipment sector.The foregoing sets are essentially composed of a tube in
plastic equipped at the ends with quick couplings for a spike
and a pouch that is empty of both liquid and air. At the
center of the section of tube there is a filter designed to
filter out any leukocytes contained in conserved blood and
platelet concentrates, extraneous particles, etc.During use the set is connected to a blood container, which
is normally a pouch having the same dimensions and
characteristics as the empty pouch, said container being
suspended from a stand and, due to the effects of gravity,
the medicament or the blood drips into the empty pouch.At the end of the process, i.e. when the upper container is
empty, the final volume of liquid or blood present in the
tube set tends to remain in the tube because of the negative
pressure progressively created inside the assembly; because
of this phenomenon a final quantity of blood or medical
liquid is effectively lost during the filtration process. To solve this problem the Applicant has already developed a
perfected tube set, which formed the subject of Italian patent
publication no. JT00225396 disclosing a set that has a
branch in the main tube in the proximity of the container,
the extremity of which is connected to a filter in
communication with free outside air and is therefore able to
restore atmosperic pressure in the central section of the
system, thus making it possible to evacuate and hence utilize
the liquid or the blood present in this section.Notwithstanding this invention, because of the characteristic
microporosity of the median filter element, and particularly,
because after the filtration of blood the filter element
tends to clog progressively thus reducing its degree of
porosity in such a way that free air is no longer able to
enter the filter medium and therefore complete emptying of
the pouch is prevented.In practical terms, the so-called "bubble point" of the
filter, this being the pressure value that the air must reach
in order to pass through the capillaries of the filtration
element soaked in blood, is not effectively reached so that

A disposable sterile apparatus for blood filtration with a system for
optimizing the recovery of blood comprising


a main tube (4, 8, 13, 18, 19) containing sterile air, one end of which can
be connected to a first container (2) containing the liquid to be filtered and

the other of which can be connected to an empty second container (20),
at least one filter (12) disposed along said main tube (4, 8, 13, 18, 19),
said filter comprising a filter body defining an interior chamber and a

filtration material (22) partioning the interior of the chamber into two

semi-chambers (21a, 21b), the first semi-chamber (21a) having an inlet
port (11) for the inlet of liquid to be filtered and the second chamber (21b)

having an outlet port (16) for the evacuation of filtered liquid and
at least one air return tube (7) for the return of air from said second
container (20) to said first container (2) acting to equalize pressure of the

liquid at the two extremities of said main tube (4, 8, 13, 18, 19) and in
