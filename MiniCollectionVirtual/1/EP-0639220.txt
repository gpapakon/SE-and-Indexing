<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a process and apparatus for gasifying a particulate solid carbonaceous fuel with a high moisture content, the process comprising: introducing the fuel into one or more pressurized drying vessels without adding water to the fuel; reducing the moisture content of the fuel in the drying vessel(s) to a level suitable for gasification by passing hot product gas through the or each drying vessel such that the fuel particles are entrained in the gas flow, thereby cooling and humidifying the gas; separating the cooled and humidified gas from the fuel; transferring the fuel with reduced moisture content from the or each drying vessel to a gasification vessel, gasifying the fuel in the gasification vessel to produce hot product gas; and introducing at least a portion of the hot product gas into the or each drying vessel. The invention also relates to an integrated process for producing power, especially electric power, from particulate solid carbanaceous fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process
for converting coal with
a high moisture content into gas for combustion. More
specifically the invention provides an improved process
and apparatus for the gasification of moist particulate coal
which does not involve the
addition of water prior to the drying stage and in which
the drying of the fuel is integrated with the cooling of
the product gas. The present invention is especially
suitable for converting moist coal into coal gas and for
convenience the invention will be hereinafter described
with reference to that application.Several processes are known by which coal may be
converted into coal gas. These conversion processes
generally occur at elevated temperatures usually between
900°C and 1500°C depending on the process of
conversion used. The processes essentially involve the
partial combustion of the coal to produce carbon monoxide
rather than carbon dioxide. Hydrocarbons and hydrogen
chemically contained in the coal also produce some
hydrogen and methane. These processes generally involve
the addition of steam and result in the production of
additional hydrogen through reactions between carbon and
water.Product gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned
or before its flow rate can be controlled through valves.
Most methods for cooling the gas use a steam generator and
superheater in which the hot gases are cooled by passing
over tubes in which water is boiled to produce steam.Most of the known gasification processes require a
feed coal which has a moisture content typically below 10 
to 20% dependent on the process. Oxygen blown gasifiers
can accept fuels with higher moisture contents. When coal
with a high moisture content is to be gasified it is first
necessary to dry the coal to reduce the moisture content
to a suitable level.In a known process for converting coal with a high
moisture content to gas, the coal is first dried in a
steam fluidised bed drying process using hot steam to dry
the coal to reduce the moisture content. The process
operates at atmospheric pressure with the raw coal crushed
before being fed into a bed in the drying vessel. The
coal bed is fluidised by bubbling hot steam injected at
the bottom, keeping the particles in the bed in constant
motion. Embedded within the region of the bed are
numerous tubes through which hot steam is passed to heat
and dry the coal. The dry coal is cooled and stored. The
coal is then transferred from the storage container to the
gasifier which is located elsewhere in the plant.The gasifier has a bed

<CLAIMS>
A process for gasifying coal with a minimum moisturc content of 50%, said process
comprising partially drying the coal in a pre-dryer to remove moisture from the surface

of the particles:

introducing, by mcans of a lock hoppcr system, the resulting partially-dricd coal
into one or more pressurized drying vessels without adding water to the coal;
reducing the moisture content of said coal in said drying vessel(s) to a level
suitable for gasification by passing hot product gas through the or each drying vessel

such that the coal particles are entrained in the gas flow, thereby cooling and
humidifying the gas;
separating said cooled and humidifed gas from said coal;
transferring said coal with reduced moisture content from the or each drying
vessel to a gasification vessel;
gasifying said coal in said gasification vessel to produce hot product gas; and
introducing at least a portion of said hot product gas into the or each drying vessel
at a temperature such that significant pyrolysis and tar release from the coal Particles in

the or each drying vessel is avoided.
A process according to claim 1 wherein heat is supplied to the predryer by steam
produced downstream from the drying vessel(s).
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said coal has a maximum particle size of
about 6 mm.
A process according tn any preceding claim wherein the pressure in the or each drying
vessel is such that the cooled and humidified gas leaving the drying vessel(s) is at a

pressure suitable for the operation of a gas turbine.
A process according to claim 4 wherein the pressure in the or each drying vessel is
between 15 and 40 atmospheres. 
A process according to claim 5 wherein the pressure in the or each drying vessel is
about 25 atmospher
es.
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the gasification vessel operates at
a similar pressure to the or each drying vcsscl.
A process according to claim 1 forming part of an integrated process for the production
of power in which the cooled and humidified gas that has been separated from the coal

is transferred to a gas turbine for the generation of power, optionally via a gas clean-up
system and/or a condensor.
A process according to claim 9 wherein heat is supplied to the predryer by steam
produced downstream from the drying vessel(s).
A process according to claim 11 wherein the exhaust gases from the gas turbine are
ducted to a steam generator, part of the steam produced therein being used to generate

power and part being diverted to the predryer,
