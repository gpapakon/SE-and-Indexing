<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a water-based ink suitable for the printing of products which can be de-inked using a flotation process, the ink containing essentially (a) 1-50 % by wt. of one or more inorganic or organic pigments; (b) 1-50 % by wt. (solids) of one or more water-dilutable non-ionic and/or self-crosslinking resins; (c) 0-25 % by wt. of one or move low-boiling alcohols; (d) 10-90 % by wt. of water and (e) 0-20 % by wt. of auxiliaries.

d) 10-90 % by wt. of water, and 
e) 0-20 % by wt. of auxiliaries. 
Water-based ink according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that it substantially contains: 


a) 8-17 % by wt. of one or more inorganic or organic 
pigments, 
b) 15-45 % by wt. (solids) of one or more water-dilutable 
non-ionic and/or self-crosslinking acrylic resins, 
c) 0-5 % by wt. of one or more low-boiling alcohols, 
d) 20-60 % by wt. of water, and 
e) 1-10 % by wt. of auxiliaries. 
Water-based ink according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that it substantially contains: 


a) 10-15 % by wt. of one or more inorganic or organic 
pigments, 
b) 25-42 % by wt. (solids) of one or more water-dilutable 
non-ionic and/or self-crosslinking acrylic resins,

characterized in that
 
the water-dilutable non-ionic and/or self-crosslinking 

acrylic resins comprise a dispersion, emulsion or solution.
