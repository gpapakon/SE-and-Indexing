<ABSTRACT>
A safety coupling device between two modular 
electric apparatus (1,12), particularly a differential 

actuator (1) and a switch (12), comprising a cover (28) 
bonded in a combined slide-and-hinge fashion to one (1) 

of the apparatus, provided with irreversible hooking 
tabs (40,41) which, once inserted into hook-on slits 

(45,46) formed in the second apparatus (12), preclude 
access to mechanical elements of electrical 

connection/disconnection by mechanically coupling in an 
irreversible manner the two apparatus (1,12), 

protecting the electrical connections (9,10) between 
the two apparatus and preventing electrical 

disconnection thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a safety coupling 
device coupling two modular electric apparatuses, 
so-called of the DIN type because intended for 
juxtaposed installation on a supporting rail conformant 
with that body of standards. In particular, the invention relates to a 
safety coupling device coupling for example differential actuators 
and current switches. As is known, differential actuators (for 
single-phase distribution systems) are electric 
apparatuses provided with a transformer having two 
bucking primary windings and a secondary winding for 
operating a release electromagnet of a manually 
wired-in device, mechanically coupleable to a switch to 
cause it to break upon operation of the differential. 
The structure is similar with three-phase systems. While the switch is to be regarded as an 
essential component to a differential protection 
electric apparatus, differential actuators and switches 
are manufactured with separate modular units which are 
either factory assembled or assembled by the electric 
system installing contractor according to and in 
conformity with safety regulations. This is dictated by the need to match,  
 
according to system requirements, the responsiveness 
and the hysteresis characteristics of the differential 
actuator, varying with application, to the capacity and 
operation times of the switches (usually maximum 
current and thermal protection switches), also varying. To meet all possible user's demands with a 
limited range of products, therefore, the two 
components must be provided as separate modules, and 
the task of assembling the two modules to suit specific 
demands is left with the installer or technically 
qualified distribution outlet. Assembly is to observe definite safety 
directions which provide inter alia the following 
requisites: 
   assembly is to be irreversible, and any 
attempt to disassembly should leave permanent traces 
and irreversible damage. Assembly means here not only the mechanical 
coupling of two modules but also the necessary electric 
coupling. The mechanical coupling means used should be 
bonded to one of the modules so as to prevent its loss 
and defeat attempts at replacing it with inappropriate 
ones. The module interconnection terminals, between  
 
the differential and the switch module, as adequately 
insulated, should be integrated to the differential 
module and preferably protected. Known are mechanical coupling devices for 
modular electric units, e.g. as described in Italian 
Patent Application No. 21764-B/87 (&

A safety coupling device coupling first (1) and 
second (12) electric apparatuses, the apparatuses being 

juxtaposed and coupled with a first side face 
(21,22) in contact and interconnected electrically with 

incoming and outgoing terminations (9,10) from a second 
face (8,20) lying crosswise to said first side face (21,22), 

comprising: 

a protection cover (28) for said second face 
(20) of said second apparatus (12), said cover (28) 

being provided with a first element (27) for hooking into 
said first apparatus (1) and at least a second element 

(40,41) for hooking into said second apparatus (12); 
bonding means (26) provided on said first apparatus (1) 
for unloosably bonding said first hooking element (27) 

into said first apparatus (1) and permitting relative 
travel of predetermined length of said cover (28) and 

said first apparatus (1) between first and second relative 
positions, along a predetermined direction (F) in the 

plane of said side face (21) of the first apparatus (1), said bonding means (26)

rotation of said cover (28) relative to said first 
apparatus (1); and

hooking element (40,41), said engagement and hook-on 

socket (45,46) intersecting with an opening (15,16) for access 
to electrical termination clamping members in said 

second apparatus (12), whereby the insertion of said 
second hooking element (40,41) into said engagement and 

hook-on socket (45,46) precludes access to said 
clamping members.

hooking element (27) consists of a first resilient tab 

(27) carried cantilever-fashion on a side of said 
cover (28), said bonding means (26) consisting of a slit 

(26) open on said second face (21) and extending 
parallel to the plane of said side face and proximate 

thereto, said tab being provided with end teeth (29,32)
