<DESCRIPTION>
The invention provides an improved process 
for the large scale production of acetic acid, (dimethoxyphosphinyl)[[1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]oxy]-,(4-nitrophenyl)methyl 
ester having the structural 
formula: 
The acetic acid, (dimethoxyphosphinyl)[[1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]oxy]-,(4-nitrophenyl)methyl 
ester is an important intermediate for reaction with 
the aldehyde 2-azetidineacetaldehyde, 3-[1-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]oxy]ethyl]-4-oxo-1-(triethylsilyl)-,[2R-[2a,3b(R*)]] 
to prepare novel 2-substituted-3-carboxy 
carbapenem antibiotics as described in 
copending application Serial No. 672,496, filed March 
20, 1991.  Methods for the synthesis of a-Ketoesters 
from aldehydes are described by D. Horne, J. Gaudino 
and W.J. Thompson, Tetrahedron Letters, 25, 3529-3532 
(1984). The synthesis of various a-alkoxyphosphonoacetates 
are described by E. Nakamura, Tetrahedron Letters, 
22, 663-666 (1981). The synthesis of 1-hydroxyalkanephosphonic 
esters is described by F. 
Texier-Boullet and A. Foucaud, Synthesis, 916 (1982). While these methods are sufficient for laboratory 
scale synthesis, our requirements are for a procedure 
amenable to large-scale work and ideally that 
the products of each step be crystalline. It has now been found that acetic acid, (dimethoxyphosphinyl)[[1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl-oxy]-,(4-nitrophenyl)methyl ester can be advantageously 
synthesized in four steps from L-tartaric acid in high 
overall yield with acceptable purity. This compound is 
used to prepare novel substituted-3-carboxy protected 
carbapenem antibiotics which can be easily deprotected 
to the carboxylic acid by catalytic reduction. By using acetic acid, (dimethoxyphosphinyl)[[1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]oxy]-,(4-nitrophenyl)methyl 
ester in the reaction with the aldehyde 
2-azetidine-acetaldehyde, 3-[1-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]oxy]ethyl]-4-oxo-1-(triethylsilyl)-,[2R-[2a,3b(R*)]], the resulting 4-nitrophenyl ester of the 
compound can be advantageously deprotected catalytically 
without poisoning of the catalyst. The process comprises reaction of L-tartaric 
acid with p-nitrobenzylbromide in the presence of 
triethylamine in N,N-dimethylformamide at 0-5oC and 
recovering the 2,3-dihydroxy-butanedioic acid 
bis-(4-nitrophenyl)ester produced as a solid. The 
2,3-dihydroxy-butanedioic acid bis-(4-nitrophenyl)ester 
is oxidized with periodic acid in tetrahydrofuran at 
room temperature and the product dihydroxyacetic acid 
4-nitrophenyl ester recovered as a solid. The  
 
dihydrox
