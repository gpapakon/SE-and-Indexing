 selected 
from polyalkylene oxides, polyacrylamides, polymethacrylamides 

and copolymers of acrylamide and/or methacrylamide 
and unsaturated organic carboxylic acids containing 3 to 

5 carbon atoms in water-miscible or water-mixed cooling 
lubricants for reducing mist formation. 
The use of polyethylene oxides as the polymer 
compounds according to claim 1. 
The use of clearly water-soluble polymer compounds

the aqueous emulsion or aqueous solution of cooling 
lubricants. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the cooling lubricant emulsions are 

made up of natural, paraffinic, naphthenic, paraffinic/naphthenic

esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-sebacate, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-adipate, 

dibutyl phthalate, esters of phosphorus-containing 
additives and other additives. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the cooling lubricant solutions are 

made up of aqueous solutions of inorganic salts, more 
particularly phosphates, borates and/or carbonates, and 

organic rust inhibitors, more particularly amines, 
alkanolamines, substituted alkanolamines and reaction 

products thereof with inorganic and/or organic acids, 
more particularly natural or synthetic carboxylic acids, 

more especially caprylic acid, ethylhexanoic acid, capric  
 

acid, 2,2,4-trimethylhexanoic acid, benzoic acid, substituted 
benzoic acids, dicarboxylic acids containing 6 to 

22 carbon atoms, phosphoric acid esters, dicarboxylic 

acids semiesters or dicarboxylic acid semiamides, citric 
acid, gluconic acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, 

polyphosphoric acid, boric acid and other additives. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the aqueous emulsions or aqueous 

solutions contain functional additives, more particularly 
lubricity promoters, anti-wear agents, corrosion inhibitors, 

antioxidants, anionic or nonionic emulsifiers, 
solubilizers, antifoam agents, biocides and/or surfactants. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the aqueous emulsions or aqueous 

solutions contain the cooling lubricants in a quantity of 
1 to 10% by weight and more particularly in a quantity of 

2 to 5% by weight. 
The use claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the clearly water-soluble polymer 

compounds are made up in pellet form together with 
propane-1,2-diol in a ratio by weight of 1:1.
