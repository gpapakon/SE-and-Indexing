<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for shaping 
cover materials into desired three-dimensional 
configurations, and more particularly to a method for 
shaping such cover materials as cover fabrics for 
vehicle seats, vehicle carpets and the like by combining 
the cover materials with foaming mixtures in the initial 
stage of foaming reaction and pressing the combined 
cover materials and foaming mixtures into desired three-dimensional 
configurations. It may be desirable to shape cover fabrics for 
vehicle seats and carpets made of knitted or woven 
fabrics to be used on the floor within the vehicle into 
three-dimensional configurations such as certain 
undulations. FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate certain of such 
examples. In FIG. 1, a carpet to be used on a floor in 
front of the front seat of the vehicle is shown in 
perspective view. The floor of the vehicle presents 
rather complex undulations dependent upon the type of 
vehicle. As the carpets to be used on such floors are 
to be fitted to such undulations, it is desirable to 
preliminarily shape these carpets into corresponding 
three-dimensional configurations. A carpet 50 shown in 
FIG. 1 has been shaped into a configuration having a 
relatively flat portions 52, low raised portions 53 
between adjacent flat portions 52, and a central raised 
portion or hump 54. Central raised portion 54 is 
provided with an opening 55 for receiving any shift 
lever or the like. Any backing materials such as, 
usually, polyurethane foams can be applied to the rear  
 
surface of such carpets by a variety of methods as 
hereinbelow described. Another example of cover materials shaped into 
desired three-dimensional configurations is a seat cover 
60 shown in FIG. 2. Cover 60 has raised side portions 
and a depressed central portion. Each side portion is 
comprised respectively of an outside wall 62, a top 
portion 63 and an inside wall 64 which is connected at 
its lowest end to the depressed central portion 65 by a 
narrow groove 67. If cover 60 is shaped into and 
maintained in these configurations, it would be easier 
to manufacture seats molded integrally with cover by 
pouring foamable mixtures such as a liquid polyurethane 
mixture into such shaped cover and allowing the mixture 
to expand and foam in situ. Various attempts have 
heretofore been made to shape cover materials into such 
three-dimensional covers. One of such attempts is a method to make false 
creases in the cover fabric by confining the fabric 
between upper and lower molds which each have

<CLAIMS>
A method for making a three-dimensional 
cover (18', 50, 60) comprising: 


providing a flexible sheet-like cover material (18) 
and a foamable liquid reaction mixture (16) and allowing the 

mixture to change to a viscous liquid as a gas 
generation reaction begins to provide a foam that 

expands and provides a foam layer (16') adjacent the cover 
material; 
positioning the cover material (18) and the foam 
layer (16') in a mold (20) having surface contours; 
closing the mold (20) after the foam layer has 
substantially completed its expansion and while still in 

its viscous liquid state to compress the foam layer and 
shape the cover material; 
allowing said foam layer to substantially cure 
and change to a solid state while within the mold along 

with the shaped cover material; and 
thereafter removing from the mold the shaped 
cover material and cured foam layer which cooperatively 

provide a shaped cover. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein the 
foamable liquid reaction mixture is provided on a film (12) 

outside the mold and immediately begins to expand and 
provide the foam layer, said flexible cover material (18) 

being combined with the foam layer (16') on said film (12), said 
foam layer being adjusted through said cover material to 

have a substantially uniform thickness, and the combined 
cover material and foam layer then being mounted in the 

mold (20) for the compression within the mold. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein said 
flexible cover material (18) is selected from the group 

consisting of woven fabrics, knitted fabrics, non-woven 
fabrics, perforated sheets, vinyls, and leather.  

 
A method as in claim 1 wherein the 
foamable liquid reaction mixture (16) is provided directly 

onto a lower mold half (22) of the mold (20) and immediately 
begins to expand and provide the foam layer (16'), and the 

cover material (18) then being combined with the foam layer (16') 
for the compression within the mold. 
A method as in claim 4 wherein a film (12) is 
located over said lower mold half (22) prior to the provision 

of said foamable liquid reaction mixture (16). 
A method as in claim 2 or 5 wherein said 
foamable liquid reaction mixture (16) is poured by a 

dispenser (14) onto said film. 
A method as in claim 2 or 5 wherein said 
foamable liquid reaction mixture (16) is sprayed onto said 

film. 
A method as in claim 2 or 5 wherein 
spacer members (11) are disposed around a surface which 

supports the film (12) on which said foamable liquid reaction 
mixture (16) is provided, said cover material (18) being mounted 

on said spacer members (11) to form a space between the film (12) 
and the cover material (18) into which said foamable liquid 

reaction mixture (16) is provided to form a composite of 
substantially uniform thickness of the cover material 

and film as well as the expanding foam layer (16') 
therebetween, and the composite then being transferred 

to and compressed by the mold (20). 
A method as in claim 2 or 4 wherein said 
foamable liquid reaction mixture (16) is selected from the 

group consisting of polyurethane compositions and 
polyurea compositions, which generate heat in the course  

 
of foaming reaction and are in the viscous state before 

curing and solidifying. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein the 
compression is performed between contoured surfaces of 

upper and lower mold halves (21, 22) having varied spacing 
between each other after the mold closing to thereby 

form the cover with a foam layer having different 
thicknesses and densities. 
A method as in claim 1 wherein the 
compression is performed without application of external 

heat.
