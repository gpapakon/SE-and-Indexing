 MULTIPLE PROCESSOR OC__*_UNICATI_NS SYSTJaMDESCRIPTIONReference to Related ApplicationsThis application is related to applications filed concurrently herewith, entitled "Ladder Sequence Controller" (Our Docket No. 401P045); "Peer-To-Peer Register Exchange Controller for PLCs" (Our Docket No. 401P046); "High-Speed Press Control System" (Our Docket No. 401P047); and, "Bus interface Board System" (Our Docket No. 401P048). The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.Technical FieldThis invention relates generally to a prograamable logic controller for controlling machine tools and particularly 

relates to a programmable logic controller having a control processor,, and an associated scan processor with its own program counter.Backerσmd of the InventionThe use of prograπnable logic controllers or P Cs to control machine tools such as punch presses, screw machines and automatic welders is well-known. The PLCs contain microprocessors operating under a set of sequential instructions to sense the condition of the machine tool, and to provide outputs for controlling the closing and opening of valves and switches to operate the machine tool.Previously, some of these PLCs have used a control processor and scan processor arrangement to increase the processing of status and control information. In one such PLC, the control processor assigned certain instructions to the scan processor, and when the scan processor finished, the control processor assigned another routine to the scan processor. For that reason, the scan processor never needed a separate readable program counter because it only performed in¬ line routines and never needed to save the contents of the program counter to do a subroutine. It would be desirable to operate this PLC with subroutines fetched directly from a user compiled memory so as to expedite the operation of the PLC and to identify the different error conditions occurring in the 

 scan processor so that the control processor oan determine if the error was momentary or continuous and act accordingly.Summary of the InventionThe invention furnishes the ability for both the control processor and the scan processor to read the contents of a program counter. The ability of the scan processor to read the program counter facilitates the scan processor to execute subroutines on its own without direction from the control processor. The invention also provides control logic identifying a parity error in the compiled user memory, a parity error in an image memory or an

CLAIMS
1. A programmable logic controller system for controlling a network for machines comprising:
(a) a control processor providing management oonπunication and supervisory functions for the system,
(b) a system bus, (c) a bus interface connecting said control processor to said system bus,
(d) a compiled user memory for containing the user programs,
(e) an intermediate user memory for generating the instructions for said compiled user memory,
(f) an image memory for receiving and storing the state of all inputs, outputs and register values; and, (g) a scan processor for performing computation of the output states and register values of said image memory, said scan processor having its own program counter and said scan processor performing its operations as controlled by the programs in said compiled user memory.
2. A programmable logic controller as defined in Claim 1, wherein the scan processor directly accesses said compiled user memory for executive instructions. 


 3. A prograπnable logic controller system including a control processor; a scan processor processing a ladder program memory means, a program counter for said scan processor substantially separate from said control processor, means to control the program counter to point to the section of said memory means to be exercised and thus enabling the use of subroutines in lieu of repeated in-line code in the program for timing and counting means thereby reducing the relative amount of memory means required.
4. A programmable logic controller as in Claim 3, further including error code generating and distinguishing means.
5. A programmable logic controller as defined in Claim 4, wherein parity and collision errors are detected, the latter indicating when the control processor is sending illegal comnands to the scan processor when the scan processor is running.
6. A programmable logic controller as defined in Claim 3, wherein said scan processor normally scans said ladder program in sequence in response to its program counter and said program counter selectively points to instructions in selected locations in compiled user memory to initiate subroutines.
7. A programmable logic controller as defined in Claim 6, wherein the subroutines effectively comprises specific modules for processing.
