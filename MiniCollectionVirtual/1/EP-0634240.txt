<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum casting apparatus includes a plurality of 
pressure pins (18) arranged in a molding cavity (6), and at 

least one pressure pin (18) is located in a portion of the 
molding cavity farthest from a gate (10). The pressure pins 

(18) are operated to pressurize the molding cavity (6) in an 
order from the pressure pin located farthest from the gate 

(10) to a pressure pin located nearest to the gate (10). A 
cross-sectional area reduced portion (40) can also be formed 

in a portion of a runner (14) connecting the molding cavity 
(6) and the molte
n metal retaining dome (8). A molten metal 
(24) in the molding cavity (6) is thereby suppressed from 

flowing backward into the molten metal retaining dome (8) 
when being pressurized by the pressure pins (18), so that 

the quality of the cast products is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum casting 
apparatus and method wherein a molding cavity is reduced in 
pressure to a vacuum and upon opening a gate, a molten metal 
is charged from a molten metal retaining dome into the 
molding cavity at a high speed. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a vacuum casting apparatus and 
method wherein the molten metal charged into the molding 
cavity is pressurized before it is solidified and during 
pressurization the molten metal is prevented from flowing 
backward toward the molten metal retaining dome. As one example of a vacuum casting apparatus and 
method capable of producing cast products of a high quality 
and at a low cost, a casting apparatus and method wherein a 
molding cavity is reduced in pressure substantially to a 
vacuum and then a molten metal is charged into the molding 
cavity was proposed by the present applicant in Japanese 
Patent Publication HEI 2-155557. The proposed casting apparatus includes a molding 
cavity which can be reduced in pressure substantially to a 
vacuum, a molten metal supply passage, a gate piston for 
opening and closing a passage connecting the molten metal 
supply passage to the molding cavity, and a pressure pin  
 
assembled in the gate piston. In the casting apparatus, the 
molding cavity is reduced in pressure to a vacuum. Then, 
the gate piston is opened so that a molten metal is charged 
through the molten metal supply passage into the molding 
cavity at a high speed. The gate is then closed to isolate 
the molding cavity filled with the molten metal from the 
molten metal retaining dome, and then the pressure pin is 
operated to pressurize the molten metal in the molding 
cavity, to solidify the molten metal quickly. In the 
molding, since the molding cavity is in a vacuum, 
involvement of air by the molten metal is prevented, so that 
casting defects due to bubbles are avoided. Further, since 
the charging speed is high, running of the molten metal in 
the molding cavity is improved and a production of slimmer 
casting products is possible. However, the following problems yet remain in the 
above-described vacuum casting apparatus and method: When the gate piston is closed to isolate the 
molding cavity from the molten metal retaining dome, a 
clearance inevitably remains between the molding die and the 
gate piston moved relative to the die. Further, 
pressurization of the molten metal in the molding cavity 
must be initiated within a short period of time after the 
gate piston has been
