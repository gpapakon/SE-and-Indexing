<ABSTRACT>
To increase a resultant 
torque and to stabilize revolution, 

an electro-mechanical energy 
conversion device (14) is fixed to a 

position at which a stepped circular 
cylindrical flexible member (13) 

equipped with fastening portions 
(13c, 13d) between fixed portions 

(13a, 13b) at both ends is fixed, in 
an ultrasonic motor of the present 

invention. When an A.C. voltage 
having a phase difference is applied 

to this electro-mechanical energy 
conversion device (14), a plurality 

of vibration modes are generated. A 
pair of circular cylindrical flexible 

members (11, 12) for clamping 
the electro-mechanical energy 

conversion device (14) are fixed 
to the stepped circular cylindrical 

flexible member (13). Accordingly, 
rotating oscillation or elliptic 

oscillation occurs at free ends (11b, 
12b) of the circular cylindrical 

flexible members (11, 12). A 
driving roller which is brought into 

pressure contact with these free ends 
(11b, 12b) is caused to rotate due 

to rotating oscillation or elliptic 
oscillation. The force applied to 

the circular cylindrical flexible 
members (11, 12) is received 

by the electro-mechanical energy 
conversion device (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic motor and an
ultrasonic conveying device using an electro-mechanical transducer
element.Prepaid cards used for an automatic cash dispenser, a telephone,
an automatic ticket publisher etc. or papers, films and the like used for a
printer, a facsimile, a copier etc. (referred to as "sheet-type objects
hereinafter") are conventionally conveyed by a ultrasonic motor which
conveys the sheet-type objects by resonating a prism vibrator made of a
metal prism in flexural vibration with its resonance frequency thereby to
rotate cup-shaped rollers provided at both ends of the prism vibrator (refer
to Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 1-274674 and 1-274675)Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a piezoelectric vibrator used by a
conventional ultrasonic motor.In the figure, denoted at 100 is a piezoelectric vibrator, which
comprises a metal prism 101 having a substantially square-shaped cross
section and piezoelectric ceramic thin plates 102a and 102b bonded to two
adjacent side surfaces of the piezoelectric vibrator 100. The piezoelectric
ceramic thin plates 102a and 102b are polarized in the direction of
thickness and electrodes, not shown, are formed on the face and back
surfaces thereof. When an alternating voltage is applied to the
piezoelectric ceramic thin plates 102a and 102b from the electrodes 
according to a predetermined method, an electric field is generated to
make the piezoelectric ceramic thin plates 102a and 102b expand and
contract to vibrate. In this case, since the metal prism 101 has
substantially a square cross section, it effects flexural vibrations having
resonance frequencies substantially equal to each other in the directions
perpendicular to each other.When alternating voltages the frequencies of which are equal to the
resonance frequency of the metal prism 101 and which are different in
phase from each other by 90Â° are applied to the piezoelectric ceramic thin
plates 102a and 102b, the both ends of the metal prism 101 effect rotating
vibration or elliptical vibrations. The metal prism 101 is equipped with
discs 103a and 103b at both ends thereof and supporting pins 104a and 104b
at the nodes of flexural vibration generated therein to be stably supported
thereby.Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a conventional ultrasonic motor.In the figure, denoted at 100 is a piezoelectric vibrator, 101 is a metal
prism, 103b is a disc and 104a and 104b are supporting pins.Cup-shaped rollers 201a and 201b each having an inner diameter
slightly larger than
