<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heterocyclic cyclohexanedione derivative, 
a process for production thereof, and a herbicide comprising the same. In agricultural and horticultural crop farming, many herbicides have been 
used for weed control which requires extraordinary labours. However, there 
have been several cases which caused phytotoxicity problems and environmental 
pollution such as residue problems therefore, it is required to develop a new 
chemical entity which can provide firm effectiveness with a lower dosage and 
can be used safely is in a high demand. It is an object of the present invention to provide a herbicide which can 
be synthesized advantageously in a industrial scale and having a property such 
as high effectiveness at lower dosage, highly safe, and high selectivity on 
crops. The present invention is directed to a heterocyclic cyclohexanedione 
derivative represented by the general formula [I]; 
wherein R¹ is optionally substituted lower alkyl, optionally substituted 
cycloalkyl, optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted 
heterocyclic ring; R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ may be the same or different from one  
 
another and each represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁶ is hydrogen; R⁷ is OR⁸ 
wherein R⁸ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aralkyl, lower acyl, alkylsulfonyl, or 
arylsulfonyl; or R⁶ and R⁷ are combined together to represent a single bond; X 
is oxygen. sulfur or N-R⁹ wherein R⁹ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, optionally 
substituted aralkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl, optionally substituted 
phenyl or optionally substituted heterocyclic ring, or a salt thereof, a 
process for producing the same, and a herbicide comprising the same. When R¹, which can be lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl or a heterocycle, 
is substituted, it may carry one or more substituents which may be 
the same or different and may represent halogen, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, 
alkenyl, haloalkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, haloalkoxy, haloalkenyloxy, 
alkoxyalkoxy, alkylthioalkoxy, alkylthio, alkenylthio, 
alkynylthio, haloalkylthio, haloalkenylthio, monoalkylamino, dialkylamino, 
alkoxyalkylthio, alkylthioalkylthio, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonylalkoxy, 
alkylcarbonyl, alkoxyamino, alkylsulfonyl, alkenylsulfonyl, alkynylsulfonyl, 
alkoxyalkylsulfonyl, alkylthioalkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfonylalkylsulfonyl, 
haloalkylsulfonyl, alkoxycarbonylalkylthio, alkylsulfinylalkoxycarbonylalkylsulfinyl, 
alkoxycarbonylalkylsulfonyl, alkylamide, aralkyloxy, 
optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted
