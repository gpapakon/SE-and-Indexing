<ABSTRACT>
A bus driver circuit for a multiplex communications 
system is configured from a limited number of components to 

withstand short circuiting of a connected bus circuit to 
voltage levels from ground potential to double conventional 

voltage levels encountered within a motor vehicle, i.e. 
twenty four (24) volts. The bus driver circuit does not 

interfere with bus operation if local power or ground is 
lost by one or more system node including the circuit, and 

can operate at relatively high frequencies, for example of 
approximately 83.3 to 166.7 kilobits per second (KBPS). 

Each line of a two-line bus (102) is driven by a 
transistor (108,120) whose current flow is limited by 

emitter degeneration and, in the case of the transistor 
which sinks current from the bus, a separate current control 

transistor (118) which monitors current flow through its 
associated bus driver transistor and reduces its base drive 

at high temperatures to limit current flow therethrough and 
compensate the circuit for temperature variations. The 

turn-on and turn-off edges of bus driver signals are rounded 
by capacitors (134,136) connected across the collector-base 

junctions of the bus driver transistors (108,120).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to multiplex
communications systems used, for example, for motor vehicles
and, more particularly, to driver circuits for connecting
individual nodes of a multiplex communications system with a
two wire, preferably twisted pair, communications bus which
interconnects nodes of the system.The use of multiplex communications systems in motor
vehicles has been known for some time to reduce the large
number of wires which are used within vehicles. In
addition, such multiplex systems benefit the design,
assembly and diagnostics of motor vehicles. A common
component of multiplex systems is a bus circuit which
interconnects nodes of a given system. Since a bus circuit
typically extends throughout a motor vehicle, it can reach a
substantial length and, accordingly, multiplex system buses
are preferably constructed as simply as possible to reduce
the costs of the multiplex system. On popular bus circuit
is constructed using a twisted pair of wires which are
terminated at least at one point to ground for one wire and
to system signal potential for the other wire.In the past, driver circuits for connecting individual
nodes of a motor vehicle multiplex communications system to
a bus circuit have been problematic. Known bus drivers
often include a substantial number of components and hence
can be costly and occupy a substantial amount of space. In
addition, reliability has plagued some bus drivers. For
example, multiplex communications systems should not be
disabled if a single node loses its power or ground, the bus
or one side of the bus is shorted to power or ground, or the
bus or one side of the bus is shorted to reverse power.
Many known bus drivers cannot survive such mishaps. In the
motor vehicle environment, it is even possible for a bus
driver to be subjected to double battery voltage or reversed
double battery voltage by attempts to jump-start the
vehicle. Accordingly, there is a need for a low cost bus driver
circuit which can reliably drive a bus circuit of a
multiplex communications system of a motor vehicle. The bus
driver circuit should preclude interference with other nodes
communicating over the bus in the event one or more nodes
each including the bus driver circuit are disabled by loss
of power or ground. Preferably, such a bus driver circuit
would be able to withstand bus shorts to ground, bus shorts
to vehicle power, or even bus shorts to direct or reversed
double vehicle power without sustaining damage.This need is met by the bus driver circuit of the
presen
