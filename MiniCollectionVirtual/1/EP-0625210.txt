<ABSTRACT>
A variable length DNA sequence has been detected in patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM). The variable length region contains a number of repeats of a three-base unit (CTG). The number of repeats in DM patients is found to exceed 50 whereas unaffected individuals were found to have less than 40 repeats. DM risk diagnosis may be carried out by detecting the length of the variable region and thereby determining the number of repeats.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES AND MATERIALS AND METHODSFOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF MYOTONIC DYSTROPHYMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is the commonest adult form of muscular dystrophy. It is an inherited neuromuscular condition found in most of the world's populations, with an incidence thought to be around 1 case per 8000 people(Harper PS, "Myotonic Dystrophy"; 2nd Edn. , Saunders, 1989).The onset and degree of severity of the disease is highly variable, ranging from very mildly affected adult cases whose only symptoms are a type of lens cataract occuring in later life, to a life-threatening neonatal form of the disease found in some affected infants who have inherited the genetic defect from their mother. The type of symptoms is also very variable and can involve a wide range of tissues including muscle, brain, heart, and endocrine organs. In general DM is characterised by myotonia and progressive muscle weakness and wasting. To date this disease has been untreatable and its biochemical basis is not understood. The gene responsible for DM has been mapped by family studies to a small region on the long arm of chromosome 19 (Harley HG et al, American Journal of Human Genetics 49, pp68-75 (1991)). Further studies have shown that the gene lies between the markers D19S63 and D19S95. We have now isolated a DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:l) that identifies the precise site in the DNA of DM patients that causes their disease (the "mutation") . The sequence was obtained from a 

collection of DNA fragments that represent the genes expressed in human brain. It is just over 2700 bases in length and is unique. Its biochemical function is the subject of further investigation. The sequence includes, at a particular point along its length, a run of repeats of a 3-base unit (CTG) . The number of times this triplet is repeated is variable between individuals. In normal unaffec¬ ted people, the number is between 5 and about 40. In DM patients the number is between 50 and at least 2000. Generally speaking, the greater the number, the more severe the disease. We have not yet found any individual with between 40 and 50 repeats and this suggests that the population divides into two distinct groups; those having less than 50 repeats being unaffected and those having 50 or more repeats being affected. The number of repeats of the 3- base sequence appears to be the basic underlying genetic difference between DM patients and normal individuals. Although it is usually the case in genetic inheritance that DNA sequences are passed from parents to offspring in

CLAIMS
1. A nucleotide sequence, comprising:- a DNA sequence derived from human chromosome 19q including a variable number of repeats of the three-base unit CTG or its complement, wherein said number is greater than about 50 in individuals affected by DM, a DNA sequence which hybridises to said first mentioned sequence over a region containing said variable number of repeats; an RNA sequence transcribed from or corresponding to either of said aforementioned DNA sequences, or a fragment containing one of said sequences.
2. A DNA sequence according to Claim 1 having a base sequence substantially as given in SEQ ID NO:l. 3. A nucleic acid hybridisation probe useful for determining the number of repeats of said three-base unit in a nucleotide sequence of Claim 1, said probe including a nucleotide sequence capable of hybridising to said nucleotide sequence, or its complementary sequence or to a fragment of either of these, said probe having associated therewith a detectable label.
4. A method of DM risk diagnosis which comprises directly or indirectly detecting, monitoring or determining the number of repeats of the three-base sequence CTG or its complement in the DNA from chromosome 19q, or the equivalent three-base unit in RNA transcribed from or corresponding to said DNA sequence, or detecting, monitoring or determining the length of the region containing said repeats. 


 5. A method of DM risk diagnosis according to Claim 4 which involves hybridising a sample of genomic DNA or RNA transcribed from or corresponding to said DNA sequence from an individual with one or more hybridisation probes accord- ing to Claim 3.
6. A method of DM risk diagnosis according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein said sample is initially exposed to a restric¬ tion enzyme before hybridisation with said probe or probes.
7. A method of DM risk diagnosis according to Claim 6, wherein said restriction enzyme is selected from EcoRI,
EcoRV, PstI and PvuII.
8. A method of DM risk diagnosis according to any of Claims 4 to 7, wherein the number of repeats or the length of the repeat region is used to predict the severity of DM of the individual.
9. A method of DM risk diagnosis according to Claim 4, which includes amplifying a region containing said repeated three-base sequence using a nucleic amplification process.
10. Primers for use in a nucleic acid amplification technique for amplifying at least the variable repeat region of a nucleotide sequence according to Claim 1.

12. Primers according to Claim 10 or 11, wherein each primer is spaced between 5 and 75 bases from the associated end of the variable repeat region. 


 13. Primers according to any of Claims 10 to 12, having base sequences substantially as identified by primer references 101 and 102 in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO: 2) , or complements thereof. 14. A diagnostic kit for carrying out a method of DM risk diagnosis which involves hybridising a sample of DNA or RNA from an individual with one or more nucleic acid probes, wherein the kit includes a nucleic acid probe and one or more other components for carrying out the method, characterised in that said probe is a probe as defined in Claim 3, and optionally including PCR primers.
