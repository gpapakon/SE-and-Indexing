<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic tape drive, a magnetic head (27) simultaneously senses plural track lateral position 
indicators to generate a like plurality of independently generated sensed position error signals. The 

sensed position error signals are combined to provide an output position error signal (100) that drives 
a positioning system to position the magnetic head laterally of the length of the magnetic tape (21). 

The output position error signal represents an average of the position errors indicated by the sensed 
posit
ion error signals. Means monitor the quality of such error signal enables eliminating poor quality 
signals from the output position error signal for maintaining a quality servo control. Upon loading the 

magnetic tape (21) to a load point, the plural track position indicators are simultaneously sensed for 
centering the head to a predetermined track position. Then, an independent head position sensor (90) 

is calibrated to the load point track position indicators for use as a verification of validity of the output 
position error signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic tape data storage particularly magnetic tape storage 
having a plurality of spaced apart servo track areas. Recording data or other information-bearing signals on magnetic tape has been practiced for 
many years. Some of the track formats on magnetic tape facilitate a so-called 
serpentine scanning 
of the tape such that the logical beginning and end of the magnetic tape are at the same physical end 
of the tape. In a preferred form of the invention, it is desired to employ serpentine scanning of data 
tracks while providing a close control of head-to-tape lateral positioning. Such control of head-to-tape lateral positioning is best achieved by relatively servoing the head 
and tape to position the head laterally to the tape. It is also desired, particularly in view of possible high 
error rates in magnetic tape, to provide a reliable set of servo tracks on a magnetic tape. Concurrently 
sensing a plurality of laterally spaced-apart servo tracks provides enhanced reliability using managed 
signal redundancies. An important aspect of magnetic tape recording is the ever increasing areal data storage density. 
While any servo track area reduces the area of any storage medium available for data storage, such 
servo track areas are necessary to provide reliable data storage and retrieval at higher areal data 
storage densities. Accordingly, it is desired to provide processing of servo signals from plural servo 
track areas in a reliable manner. It is also desired to provide position error checking independently of 
processing redundant position error signals. Most prior art magnetic tapes having longitudinally extending tracks do not employ servo tracks 
on the tape. While the so-called slant track tapes, video for example, employ servo tracks, such servo 
tracks are for synchronizing a rotating head to the tape motion and slant track position. As seen in US 
patent 4,224,643 by Nakano et al and in US patent 4,760,475 by Wong et al, the servo tracks are at the 
longitudinal edges of the video tape for synchronizing a rotary head assembly while scanning so-called 
slant tracks. In contrast to video recording, most data storing tapes have longitudinally scanned tracks. US 
patent 4,639,796 by Solhjell shows positioning a head assembly laterally of the tape for longitudinally 
scanning different data tracks by optically sensing the longitudinal edges of the tapes. Such tape-edge 
sensing does not provide the desired accuracy needed for the now higher track densities.
