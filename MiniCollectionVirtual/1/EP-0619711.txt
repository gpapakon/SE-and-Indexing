<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to toothbrushes having 
bristle tufts ending in two or more distinct planes, the free ends of 
the individual bristles in all of said tufts exhibiting a generally 
rounded form. In particular, the present invention pertains to a 
method of making such toothbrushes by incrementally attaching, 
trimming, and end rounding successive levels of bristle tufts, 
starting with a lowest level and proceeding stepwise to successively 
higher levels of bristle tufts. Use of a brush to clean teeth is a generally accepted means 
of maintaining oral hygiene. Consequently, many different styles and 
types of toothbrushes are either disclosed in the art or available in 
the market. Different combinations of bristle stiffness, handle 
design, brush head profile, bristle contour and the like provide 
varying degrees of cleaning, comfort, and, unfortunately, tooth and 
gum tissue damage. It is generally known that toothbrushes with contoured 
bristle heights, such as a sinusoidal wave form, enable the bristles 
to more easily penetrate the space between the teeth, thereby 
providing improved cleaning. It is also generally known that end rounding of individual 
bristles reduces tooth and gum tissue damage by removing the sharp 
edges which result from the bristle trimming operation. Positioning 
the free ends of the bristles against an orbital grinder is a very 
effective means to achieve end rounding when the free ends of the 
bristles terminate within a common plane. However, with a contoured 
brush insufficient penetration of the grinder into the bristle tufts 
tends to round only the longest bristles. Conversely, grinder 
penetration sufficient to end round the shorter bristles damages and 
distorts the longer bristles.  
 Complex grinding systems have been developed to attempt to 
end round bristles after they have been attached to the brush head 
and trimmed to the desired contour. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
2,227,126 issued to Cooke on December 31, 1940 discloses a complex 
combination of contoured grinding wheels, blades, and oscillating 
motions used in an attempt to end round the tips of bristles which 
are not within a common plane. The disclosed process is expensive, 
marginally effective, and limited to relatively simple contours. U.S. Patent No. 2,426,328 issued to Wandel et al. on August 
26, 1947 discloses a thermal process for end rounding bristles. 
However, the thermal process, especially for a contoured brush 
pattern, is a very random process. Thickening of the bristle

A method of making a toothbrush having bristle tufts (2, 4, 6) with 
bristle ends in distinct planes, (3, 5, 7) all of said bristle tufts (2, 4, 6) having 

individual bristles (8, 108, 118) which are substantially uniformly rounded at 
their free ends, said method comprising the steps of: 


(a) affixing a first group of bristle tufts (2) to a toothbrush 
head (1); 
(b) cutting all of said tufts (2) so that the free ends of the 
bristles (8) contained in said first group of bristle tufts (2) are 

all in a first plane (3); 
(c) subjecting the free ends of said individual bristles (8) in 
said tufts to an end rounding process while said free ends 

of said bristles are all in said first plane (3) to produce a 
generally rounded form on the free ends of said bristles; 
(d) affixing at least a second group of bristle tufts (4) to said 
brush head (1); 
(e) cutting the ends of said second group of bristle tufts (4) so 
that the free ends of the bristles (108) contained in said second 

group of bristle tufts (4) are all in a second plane (5) which is 
at a higher elevation than said first plane (3) relative to 

said brush head (1); and 
(f) subjecting the free ends of said individual bristles (108) 
contained in said second group of bristle tufts (4) to an end 

rounding process while said free ends of said bristles (108) in 
said second group of bristle tufts (4) are all in said second 

plane (5) to produce a generally rounded form on the free ends 
of said bristles (108) without disturbing the free ends of the 

bristles (8) in said first plane (3). 
The method of Claim 1, wherein each of said end rounding 
processes comprises mechanical grinding. 
The method of Claim 2, wherein said mechanical grinding 
processes in said first and second planes (3, 5) are each performed by an 

orbital grinder (70).  
 
The method of Claim 1, wherein each of said end rounding 
processes are performed by immersing for a limited period of time and 

to a predetermined depth the free ends of the bristles (8, 108) contained in 
said first and second groups of bristle tufts (2, 4), respectively, into a 

chemical solvent capable of at least partially dissolving said 
bristles. 
The method of Claim 1, further including the steps of: 

(g) affixing a third group of bristle tufts (6) to said brush head (1); 
(h) cutting the ends of said third group of bristle tufts (6) so 
that the free ends of said bristles (118) in said third group of 

bristle tufts (6) are all in a third plane (7) which is at a higher 
elevation than said second plane relative (5) to said brush 

head (1); and 
(i) subjecting the free ends of said individual bristles (118) 
contained in said third group of bristle tufts (6) to an end 

rounding process while said free ends of said bristles (118) in 
said third group of bristle tufts (6) are all in said third 

plane (7) to produce a generally rounded form on the free ends 
of said bristles (118) without disturbing the free ends of said 

bristles (8, 108) in said first and second planes (3, 5). 
The method of Claim 5, wherein said first, second and third 
groups of bristle tufts (2, 4, 6) are so positioned adjacent one another along 

the longitudinal axis of said brush head (1) that they collectively 
produce a generally sinusoidal profile when said brush head (1) is viewed 

from a side elevation. 
The method of Claim 6, wherein the points of maximum 
amplitude in said sinusoidal profile substantially coincide with the 

gaps formed between the user's teeth.
