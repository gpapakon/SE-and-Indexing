<ABSTRACT>
Optical receiving system, incoming unipolar pulses being converted 
into bipolar pulses having a constant top amplitude (elements 2, 3 and 4) 

which, on the one hand, are used for generating replicas of the original pulses, 
but having a constant top amplitude (element 5) and, on the other hand, for 

eliminating mutual phase differences by means of phase comparison with 
local clock pulses (elements 7..14). The latter is preferably effected by the 

bipolar pulses being multiplied (element 7) by the clock pulses, and by using 
the resulting DC signal to control a controllable delay element (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical receiving system, comprising an
optical/electrical converter for converting optical input pulses into
electrical output pulses.The invention makes provision for an optical receiving system which
is found to be eminently suitable for highly reliable transmission of
so-called "burst mode" pulse-like signals. In particular, the system
according to the invention is found to be eminently satisfactory in
the transmission of ATM data cells. The receiving system according to
the invention is especially designed for the reception and
transmission, in a network exchange, of ATM data cells from local,
passive optical networks (PONs) where it is possible for the ATM cells
originating from different subscribers to have different pulse
amplitudes, as a result of the different distances between the
subscribers and the network exchange. Moreover, owing to these
different distances, phase differences arise between the incoming
signals and the system clock in the receiving system. In the system
according to the invention, a number of modules are combined, some of
which are known per se but which are eminently suitable for being
combined with one another to give a system which is inexpensive and
has a high processing speed, which makes the system very suitable for
ATM applications.The system according to the invention comprises two subsystems viz. a
pulse smoother and a phase corrector which are integrated in a
synergetic way. It is noted that pulse smoothers and phase correctors
as such are known from, for instance, EP-A-0424741 and WO-A-91/15927
respectively. However, the architecture of those known subsystems are
different from the architecture of the subsystems according to the
present invention outlined below, and, consequently, those subsystems
cannot be integrated as easily and simply as the subsystems according
to the invention. The first subsystem comprises a first pulse/pulse converter (2), such as
a delay line differentiator, for converting output pulses of the optical receiver
(1) into pulses having a pulse width which is small compared to that of the
original pulses, and having constantly alternating polarity, whose appearance
times correspond to the appearance times of leading and trailing edges of the
original pulses and whose amplitudes are equal to the amplitudes of the
original pulses; a feed-forward-connected amplitude-correction element (3,4)
for converting the output pulses of the said pulse/pulse converter into pulses
of constant top amplitude; and a second

optical/electrical converter (1) into pulses having a pulse width
which is small compared to that of the original pulses, and having

constantly alternating polarity, whose appearance times correspond to
the appearance times of leading and trailing edges of the original

pulses and whose amplitudes are equal to the amplitudes of the
original pulses; a feed-forward-connected amplitude-correction element

(3,4) for converting the output pulses of the said pulse/pulse
converter into pulses of constant top amplitude; and a second

pulse/pulse converter (5), such as an integrator, for converting the
bipolar output pulses of the amplitude-correction element into

unipolar pulses of which the appearance times of the leading and

trailing edges correspond to the appearance times of the output pulses
of the amplitude-correction element, the optical receiving

system further comprising a phase comparator (9,10,11,7) for
comparing the phase of the pulses emitted by the said

optical/electrical converter (1), or of representatives thereof, with
the phase of the pulses emitted by a system clock generator and

emitting, as a function of the comparison result, a control signal to
a delay element (8),

the output pulses of the optical/electrical converter or
representatives thereof being presented to a first input of the phase

comparator, and the pulses emitted by a system clock generator being
presented to a second input of the phase comparator, while said

control signal is taken off an output of that phase comparator, the
delay time of said delay element being controlled by that control

signal originating from the phase comparator in such a way that the
pulses presented to that delay element are delayed in accordance with

the difference between the phase of those pulses originating from the
optical/electrical converter and the phase of the clock pulse 

generator, whereas the bipolar output pulses of the amplitude-correction
element (4) are presented to the said first input (9) of

the phase comparator.

 that the phase comparator comprises a mixing stage
(7) having the two input signals of the phase comparator, or

representatives of those two input signals, are mixed together
multiplicatively, the DC component of the mixing product being

presented as a control signal to the said delay element (8).
