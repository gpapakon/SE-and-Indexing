<ABSTRACT>
A panel display comprises a screen (45) for displaying 
an image, a stylus (46), and means (44) for determining 

the position of the stylus when the stylus is placed 
adjacent to the screen. The display also includes means 

(41, 42) for projecting an image onto the screen, and a 
substantially thin lens (43) for focussing the image on 

the screen. The thickness of the lens is substantially 
less than the width of the display so that the panel 

display is also substantially thin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a digitizing tablet 
integrally formed with a flat panel or other type of rear 
projection display, and more specifically with a 
fast-update, durable digitizing tablet having excellent 
spatial linearity and stability, and which integrates well 
with a projection display. Transparent digitizing tablets are often intended for 
use with some sort of display system in order to provide 
the user with the appearance of writing on top of the 
displayed image. This may be done, for example, to 
facilitate outline tracing of some structure in a projected 
photographic image, to allow an input mode which emulates 
natural writing. In all of these applications, 
correspondence between the coordinate system of the 
transparent tablet and that of the display system is a 
desired, if not crucial, characteristic. Prior art transparent digitizing tablets, such as the 
SPD series of devices manufactured by Scriptel Corporation 
of Columbus, Ohio, utilize magnetic, electrostatic, or 
acoustic techniques to specify the location of the stylus. 
Use of such a prior art transparent digitizing tablet as a 
combination display/digitizer, such as the FIOS-6440 device 
manufactured by Photron Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan, or the use of 
a transparent digitizing tablet such as the TNN-01 from 
Sony Corporation in conjunction with a CRT, can result in 
poor correspondence between the detected location of the 
stylus and the desired portion of the displayed image. Figure 1 shows a cross section of a typical prior art 
transparent digitizer tablet system including a digitizing  
 
tablet 11 located adjacent to liquid crystal display 12. 
Prior art system 10 includes a surface plate 13 (which may 
help to contain liquid crystal display 12) located above 
liquid crystal display 12 and upon which stylus 14 is 
placed, thus leading to problems with parallax, since the 
image is formed on liquid crystal display 12 located below 
the surface of surface plate 13. Regardless of the 
technique used to specify the location of the cursor with 
respect to the displayed image, the tablet must be aligned 
with respect to the image produced by the display, and may 
not, even when optimally aligned, provide coordinates which 
register well with those of the displayed image due to 
distortions in either or both the tablet or the image 
produced by the display. The additional difficulties due 
to parallax are described, for example, in "Handwriting 
Recognition on Transparent Tablet over Flat Display",

<CLAIMS>
A panel display comprising a screen (45), a stylus 
(46), means (44) for determining the position of said 

stylus when said stylus is placed adjacent to said 
screen, means (41,42) for projecting an image onto said
