<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a BPSG film in a PECVD reactor with ratios 
of P₂O₃/P₂O₅ such that the film flows at low temperature in a 

non-oxidizing ambient and produces a reduced number of 
particulates. The method permits tailoring of the wall angle 

of a BPSG film by controlling the P₂O₃/P₂O₅ ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to smoothing contours on the 
surface of an integrated circuit chip by flowing a 
borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG). More particularly, it 
relates to a composition of the BPSG and methods for its 
deposition and anneal that provide desired step coverage, wall 
angle, and film stability. Even more particularly, it relates 
to a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process 
for BPSG deposition that provides a BPSG composition that can 
later be flowed at low temperature in a non-oxidizing ambient. BPSG films are widely used in the semiconductor industry, 
offering an insulating material with three key advantages: (1) 
BPSG can be flowed at a lower temperature than other materials 
to smooth steps and fill trenches, providing a gradually 
tapered contour that permits deposition of a uniform thickness 
of metal; and (2) the phosphorous in BPSG is capable of mobile 
ion gettering. The ability to process at low temperature is increasingly 
important for the fabrication of integrated circuits with 
devices having short channel lengths and shallow junctions. By 
taking advantage of the ability to flow the glass at low 
temperature, a smoother surface is achieved without 
redistribution of dopants in these underlying integrated 
circuit devices. A surface free of sharply changing topology 
permits metal layers to be deposited with more uniform metal 
thickness and provides a more reliable insulation between  
 
conductive layers. Without a material that flows, it was found 
that the insulator and the conductor are much thinner adjacent 
steps, and these are the regions that are later found to 
produce either opens in the metal lines or short circuits 
between levels of metal. A BPSG anneal step that flows the 
glass eliminates the thinning problems and increases chip 
reliability. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has long been used to deposit 
BPSG on integrated circuits. Three processes are available, 
atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD), low 
pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), and plasma 
enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). In the APCVD process used in manufacturing, wafers move on a 
belt through a furnace at elevated temperature under injectors 
that provide separate flows of reactant gases that mix and 
react on the wafer surface. Reactant gases typically emanate 
from different parts of the injector and reactants are held 
apart from each other for a short distance in the furnace by 
nitrogen blankets so that reactants mix and
