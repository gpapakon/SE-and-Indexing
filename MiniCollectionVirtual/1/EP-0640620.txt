<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the human enzyme, pancreatic 
cholesterol esterase (PCE), and a receptor (PCE
R
) for this protein 
expressed by cells of the intestinal lining. Specifically, the 

invention relates to the use of inhibitors of binding between PCE and 
PCE
R
 to reduce intestinal uptake of dietary cholesterol in humans. 
Antibodies, including antisera, and monoclonal and chimeric antibodies, 

and cell lines producing such antibodies, raised against the PCE
R
 
protein or fragments or epitopes thereof, are also provided. There is 

also described treatment of individuals with therapeutic drugs for the 
prevention of alleviation of disease states in a human related to 

cholesterol metabolism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dietary cholesterol absorption in humans and methods 
for inhibiting this absorption. In particular, the invention relates to a human enzyme, 
pancreatic cholesterol esterase (PCE), known to be important in facilitating dietary 
cholesterol absorption, and a receptor (PCER) for this protein expressed by cells of the 
intestinal lining. Specifically, the invention relates to the use of inhibitors of binding 
of the PCE receptor with PCE to reduce intestinal uptake of dietary cholesterol in 
humans. Antibodies, including antisera, and monoclonal and chimeric antibodies, and 
cell lines producing such antibodies, raised against the PCER protein or fragments or 
epitopes thereof, are also provided. The invention also relates to treatment of 
individuals with therapeutic drugs for the prevention or alleviation of disease states 
in a human related to cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol metabolism is of critical interest to those involved in protecting 
human health. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United States and 
reduction of serum cholesterol levels has recently been embraced as a national health 
priority. See NIH Consensus Panel Report, J.A.M.A. 253: 2094 (1985). NIH 
recommendations include measurement of serum cholesterol in all adults, with efforts 
to reduce cholesterol in those individuals with levels above 200 mg%. In this regard 
front line therapy is a reduction in the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides 
ingested, followed by the use of agents that interfere with absorption of ingested lipids. 
See Consensus Full Report, Arch. Inst. Med. 148: 36 (1988). Since about 90% of dietary cholesterol is comprised of free cholesterol, it is not 
obvious that pancreatic cholesterol esterase should be important in dietary cholesterol 
absorption in humans. In fact, it had been thought prior to this time that cholesterol 
esterase was not important for cholesterol absorbsion [see. for example. Huang and Hiu, 
J. Lipid Res. 31: 2029 (1991)]. Unexpectedly, pancreatic cholesterol esterase is now 
known to play a pivotal role in the absorption of cholesterol and fatty acids (U.S. 
Patent No. 5,017,565, issued May 21, 1991). Pancreatic cholesterol esterase is 
known to interact with and be bound to cells lining the intestinal brush border (Bosner 
et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 7438-7442) via a receptor-like interaction 
with brush border membrane-associated heparin. Human (Nilsson et al., 1990, Eur. J.  
 
Biochem. 192: 323-326; Kumar et al.,
