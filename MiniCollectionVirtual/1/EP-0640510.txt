<ABSTRACT>
A positioning device for a reflector of a motor vehicle headlamp serves to pivot the reflector about a fixed axis. The positioning device has a drive which consists of a toothed wheel and a toothed rack and whose toothed wheel is rotatably mounted on a receptacle component which bears the reflector, the teeth of the said toothed wheel intermeshing with the teeth of the toothed rack. The toothed rack engages on the side facing away from the toothed wheel in a guide of the receptacle component and has a free end section which is directed towards the reflector and which is connected to the reflector by means of a joint. Transversely with respect to the wide side faces of the toothed rack, the said toothed rack has at least in certain sections such a small cross-section that it can be bent to form a bow and can describe an arc at the joint, which arc is defined by the reflector as it pivots about the pivot axis.

Setting arrangement for a reflector in motor vehicle head 
lamps wherein the reflector (1) is connected to a stationary 

receiving member (2) so that it can swivel about one or about 
two axes extending transversely with respect to each other and 

wherein at least one of the connections between the 
reflector (1) and the receiving member (2) is constituted by a 

setting device which has an actuator consisting of a toothed 
wheel (3) and a toothed rack (4) whose toothed wheel (3) is 

rotatably mounted on the receiving member (2) and its teeth 
mesh with the teeth of the toothed rack (4) which, at its side 

facing away from the toothed wheel (3), is guided for 
displacement in its longitudinal direction on the inner surface 

of the receiving member (2), its wide side surface, which has 
the teeth, extending parallel with respect to the swivel axis 

about which the reflector (1) swivels upon displacement of the 
toothed rack (4), and which at its free end section (5) is 

connected with the reflector (1) by a linkage (6) and carries 
the reflector (1), and which at least within a setting range of 

the reflector extends along an arc and follows an arc (14) of a 
circle at the linkage (6) described by the swivelling of the 

reflector (1) about the swivel axis, characterised in that the 
toothed rack (4), along a part section extending between the 

toothed wheel (3) and the linkage (6), transversely to the wide 
side surfaces of the toothed rack (4), is of such small cross 

section, at least along sections, that the toothed rack (4) can 
be bent into the shape of an arc. 
Setting arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the toothed rack (4) is weakened in its cross section by 

indentations (7) which are contrived in the back facing away 
from the toothed wheel (3) and extend transversely with respect 

to the longitudinal direction of the toothed rack (4). 
Setting arrangement according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the indentations (7) are equally spaced apart from each 

other. 
Setting arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,  
 

characterised in that the indentations (7) have a taper 
narrowing towards the base. 
Setting arrangement according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the indentations (7) are contrived in at 

least one rib (8) which is formed on the back of the toothed 
rack (4) and extends in the longitudinal direction of the 

toothed rack (4). 
Setting arrangement according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the indentations (7) form slots in at least part of the 

rib along its entire height. 
Setting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the toothed rack (4) is tightly gripped 

between three locations (9, 10 and 11), of which one 
location (9) is formed by the toothed wheel (3) and the two 

other locations (10 and 11) are formed by a slide surface (12) 
of the guide (16) of the receiving member (2), the 

location (9), as seen transversely with respect to the 
longitudinal direction of the toothed rack (4), being arranged 

between the two locations (10 and 11). 
Setting arrangement according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the toothed rack (4), in its gripped state, describes an 

arc (13) of a circle whose centre lies near the centre of the 
arc (14) of a circle described at the linkage (6) by the 

reflector (1) as it swivels. 
Setting arrangement according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the slide surface (12) of the guide (16) 

of the receiving member (2), which serves for the back of the 
too
thed rack (4), ends spaced short of the free end section (5) 
of the toothed rack (4) directed towards the linkage (6), and 

in the installed position of the head lamp at least the lower 
wall section (18) of the guide of the receiving member (2) 

extends beyond the end of the slide surface (12) towards the 
linkage (6). 
Setting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the indentations form wall sections, 

extending right through, transversely with respect to the 
longitudinal direction of the toothed rack.
