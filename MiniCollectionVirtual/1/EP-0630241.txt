 INDO E D--EOVATIVES WITH -WTIvTRAL ACTIVITYThe present invention relates to certain indole derivatives, salts, esters and physiologically functional derivatives thereof, to their use in medical therapy and in particular to their use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections.Of the DNA viruses, those of the herpes group are the sources of the most common viral illnesses in man. The group includes herpes simplex virus (HSV) , varicella zoster virus (VZV) , cytomegalovirus (CMV) ; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) . HSV 1 and HSV 2 are some of the most common infectious agents of man. Most of these viruses are able to persist in the host's neural cells; once infected, individuals are at risk of recurrent clinical manifestations of infection which can be both physically and psychologically distressing.HSV infection is often characterised by extensive and debilitating lesions of the skin, mouth and/or genitals. Primary infections may be subclinical although tend to be more severe than infections in individuals previously exposed to the virus. Ocular infection by HSV can lead to keratitis or cataracts thereby endangering the host's sight. Infection in the newborn, in im unocompromised patients including AIDS patients or penetration of the infection into the central nervous system can prove fatal.Transmission of the virus is by direct physical contact between a host and a recipient; the spread of HSV infection is therefore considered a very significant social problem, particularly as no effective vaccine is yet available.Varicella zoster (VZV) is a herpesvirus which causes chickenpox andJ* shingles. Chickenpox is the primary disease produced in a host without immunity and in young children is usually a mild illness 

characterised by a vesicular rash and fever. Shingles or zoster is the recurrent form of the disease which occurs in adults who were previously infected with varicella-zoster virus. The clinical manifestions of shingles are characterised by neuralgia and a vescicular skin rash that is unilateral and dermatomal in distribution. Spread of inflammation may lead to paralysis or convulsions. Coma can occur if the meninges becomes affected. In immunodeficient patients VZV may disseminate causing serious or even fatal illness. VZV is of serious concern In patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs for transplant purposes or for treatment of malignant neoplasia and Is a serious complication of AIDS patients due to their Impaired immune
