<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable compositions, 
especially curable coating compositions, particularly acrylic 
compositions. Curable polyurea compositions for coating and/or 
molding are well-known in the art. They provide a number of 
desirable characteristics such as hardness, low temperature 
curability, mar resistance and low cost. The most commonly used curable polyureas are based on 
urea formaldehyde resin. Many such polyurea compositions have 
been found to be unsuitable for exterior coatings, exhibiting 
poor durability upon prolonged exterior exposure. It has thus long been desired to produce a composition 
that exhibits many of the advantages of polyureas, while still 
providing adequate exterior durability. There is provided according to the present 
invention a curable coating composition comprising: 
(A) a polyurea reaction product of a mixture comprising: 
(1) a polyisocyanate, and (2) ammonia, ammonium hydroxide a primary amine, or water and (B) a compound having a plurality of functional groups that are 
reactive with urea groups on said polyurea. The polyurea used in the practice of the present 
invention is the reaction product of a polyisocyanate and 
ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, or a primary amine. The 
polyisocyanate has at least two isocyanate groups, and preferably 
no more than six. Illustrative examples of useful 
polyisocyanates include monomeric polyisocyanates, such as 
monomeric diisocyanates of hydrocarbons, preferably hydrocarbons 
having from from 6 to 18 carbon atoms (e.g., isophorone 
diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate,  
 
dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate) or 
triisocyanates such as 1,2,4-benzene triisocyanate; isocyanurates 
and biurets of monomeric isocyanates, such as the isocyanurate of 
isophorone diisocyanate, the isocyanurate of hexamethylene 
diisocyanate, or the biuret of hexamethylene diisocyanate; 
oligomers or prepolymers containing isocyanate groups; and 
isocyanate-terminated polyurethanes or polyureas. Polymers containing isocyanate groups, such as 
oligomers, prepolymers, or polymers of isocyanates (e.g., m-isopropyl-α,α-dimethylbenzyl 
isocyanate) may be formed by the 
reaction of an excess of polyisocyanate equivalents with a 
polymeric or oligomeric compound containing more than one 
isocyanate-reactive group (e.g., active hydrogen). Examples of 
useful compounds containing more than one isocyanate-reactive 
group include polyols (e.g., alkyl polyols, polyester polyols, 
polyether polyols, and acrylic
