<ABSTRACT>
A method for separating conjunct polymers and 
sulfolane from a mixture containing conjunct polymers, 

sulfolane, and hydrofluoric acid is disclosed, which 
method comprises the sequential steps of separating 

hydrofluoric acid from the mixture to provide an 
intermediate stream containing less than 30 percent 

hydrofluoric acid by weight and gravitationally 
separating the intermediate stream into a sulfolane-enriched 

stream and a conjunct polymer-enriched stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
Industrial alkylation processes have historically 
used concentrated hydrofluoric or sulfuric acid 
catalysts under relatively low temperature conditions. 
Acid strength is preferably maintained at 88 to 94 
weight percent by the continuous addition of fresh acid 
and the continuous withdrawal of spent acid. As used 
herein, the term "concentrated hydrofluoric acid" 
refers to an essentially anhydrous liquid containing at 
least about 85 weight percent HF. Hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid alkylation 
processes share inherent drawbacks including 
environmental and safety concerns, acid consumption, 
and sludge disposal. For a general discussion of 
sulfuric acid alkylation, see the series of three 
articles by L. F. Albright et al., "Alkylation of 
Isobutane with C4 Olefins", 27 Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 
381-397, (1988). For a survey of hydrofluoric acid  
 
catalyzed alkylation, see 1 Handbook of Petroleum 
Refining Processes 23-28 (R. A. Meyers, ed., 1986). Hydrogen fluoride, or hydrofluoric acid (HF) is 
highly toxic and corrosive. However, it is used as a 
catalyst in isomerization, condensation, polymerization 
and hydrolysis reactions. The petroleum industry used 
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride primarily as a liquid 
catalyst for alkylation of olefinic hydrocarbons to 
produce alkylate for increasing the octane number of 
gasoline. Years of experience in its manufacture and 
use have shown that HF can be handled safely, provided 
the hazards are recognized and precautions taken. 
Though many safety precautions are taken to prevent 
leaks, massive or catastrophic leaks are feared 
primarily because the anhydrous acid will fume on 
escape creating a vapor cloud that can be spread for 
some distance. Previous workers in this field 
approached this problem from the standpoint of 
containing or neutralizing the HF cloud after its 
release. U.S. Patents 4,938,935 and 4,985,220 to Audeh and 
Greco, as well as U.S. Patent 4,938,936 to Yan teach 
various methods for containing and/or neutralizing HF 
acid clouds following accidental releases. It would be particularly desirable to provide an 
additive which decreases the cloud forming tendency of 
HF without compromising its activity as an isoparaffin: 
olefin alkylation catalyst. Solvents and complexing 
agents for hydrofluoric acid have, in the past, been 
disclosed for various purposes as noted in the 
following references. U.S. Patent 2,615,908 to McCaulay teaches 
thioether-HF-copper complex compounds and a method for 
preparing the same. Potential uses for the

A method for separating conjunct polymers and 
sulfolane from a mixture containing conjunct 

polymers, sulfolane, and hydrofluoric acid 
comprising the sequential steps of separating 

hydrofluoric acid from said mixture to provide an 
intermediate stream containing less than 30 

percent hydrofluoric acid by weight and 
gravitationally separating said intermediate 

stream into a sulfolane-enriched stream and a 
conjunct polymer-enriched stream.

polymers are formed as byproduct in an 

isoparaffin-olefin alkylation process. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the hydrofluoric 
acid is separated from the mixture by stripping. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the stripping fluid 
comprises an isoparaffin. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the stripping step 
comprises sequentially stripping the mixture with 

isoparaffin and then stripping the mixture with 
nitrogen. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the hydrofluoric 
acid separation step provides an intermediate 

stream containing less than 25 percent 
hydrofluoric acid by weight. 
The method of claim 6 wherein the hydrofluoric 
acid separation step provides an intermediate 

stream containing less than 10 percent 
hydrofluoric acid by weight.  

 
The method of claim 7 wherein the hydrofluoric 
acid separation step provides an intermediate 

stream containing less than 5 percent hydrofluoric 
acid by weight.
