<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a
particular carbonate ester as a lubricating base with
a low quantity of smoke for two-phase engines with
internal combustion, and compositions which contain
said carbonate ester.Two-phase engines are widely used in the field of
two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles and scooters,
in the field of outboard motors and for agricultural
and gardening equipment. In these engines the lubricant
is mixed with the fuel and with this enters the
combustion chamber where it lubricates the walls of the
cylinder and is then burnt together with the fuel. The
main technical problems connected to the lubrication of
two-phase engines are therefore related to obtaining
correct lubrication minimizing the formation of
deposits and smokes at the exhaust. The problem of
smokes at the exhaust has been particularly and 
increasingly in the recent past, together with the
necessity of using compositions based on biodegradable
oils.The majority of lubricating compositions used in
the art for two-phase engines consists of a mineral oil
base, a bright stock (mixtures of high viscosity,
refined and waxless lubricating oils), additives and,
in the case of engines with separate lubrication, also
a light hydrocarbon used as diluent to facilitate
miscibility in the fuel. More recently the use of a
polyisobutene with a high molecular weight has been
introduced, to substitute the bright stock, which has
reduced the amount of smokes at the exhaust and carbon
residues in the engine, without however reaching
completely satisfactory results. In addition
polyisobutene, like mineral oils, is not biodegradable.The problem of smoke and biodegradability is
particularly felt in the use of agricultural and
gardening equipment, where the operator is often very
near the exhaust pipe (for example foresters who use
motor saws) and where the spreading of oil can be
harmful to the working environment and, for the same
reasons, in the field of outboard motors.The Applicants have studied the problem in great
depth and have found that the objectives of a limited 
amount of smoke and biodegradability can be reached by
using, in these lubricating compositions, synthetic
bases consisting of carbonate esters having a
particular structure.It should be noted that various esters of carbonic
acid are used in lubricating and plasticizing compositions
in different areas of the art. For example
US-A- 2,758,975 describes the use of esters of
carbonic acid as bases for lubricants. Chemical
