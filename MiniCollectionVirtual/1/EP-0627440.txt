<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorenyl compounds. Another aspect of
this invention relates to fluorenyl compounds having substitution at the 9
position. In still another aspect the present invention relates to
metallocenes with such fluorenyl compounds and the use of
such metallocenes in the polymerization of olefins.Since the discovery of ferrocene in 1951, a number of
metallocenes have been prepared by the combination of compounds having
cyclopentadiene structure with various transition metals. The term
"cyclopentadiene structure" as used herein refers to the following
structure. 
The term "cyclopentadiene-type compounds" as used herein refers
to compounds containing the cyclopentadiene structure. Examples include
unsubstituted cyclopentadiene, unsubstituted indene, unsubstituted
fluorene, tetrahydroindene, and substituted varieties of such compounds.Many of the cyclopentadienyl-type metallocenes have been found
useful in catalyst systems for the polymerization of olefins. It has been
noted in the art that variations in the chemical structure of such
cyclopentadienyl-type metallocenes can have significant effects upon the
suitability of the metallocene as a polymerization catalyst. For example,
the size and substitutions on cyclopentadienyl-type ligands has been found
to affect the activity of the catalyst, the stereoselectivity of the
catalyst, the stability of the catalyst, and other properties of the
resulting polymer; however, the effects of various substituents is still
largely an empirical matter, that is, experiments must be conducted in
order to determine just what effect a particular variation will have upon a
particular type of cyclopentadienyl-type metallocene. Some examples of
some cyclopentadienyl-type metallocenes are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,530,914; 4,808,561; and 4,892,851.EP-A 0 524 624 describes metallocenes having the formula R"x (FIRn)
(CpRm) MeQk. A metallocene compound exhibiting at the 9-position of the
fluorenyl radical a substituent is neither individually disclosed nor described
in a general manner. The metallocene compounds of EP-A 0 524 624 are
said to be useful as olefin polymerization catalysts. Similarly, DE-OS 26 59
166 deals with metallocene compounds suitable as catalysts for the polymerization
of olefins. The metal atom according to this publication is always a
chromium metal.Examples 52-56 of that document describe a catalyst
comprising bis(9-methyl-fluorenyl)chromium.Metallocenes in which two of the metal bound cyclopentadienyl
type groups are connected by a
