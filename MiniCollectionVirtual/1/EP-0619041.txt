 SPEECH INFORMATION EXTRACTORBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe invention relates to methods and apparatus for extracting the information content of audio signals, in particular audio signals associated with human speech.2. Related ArtConventional devices for extracting the information content from human speech are plagued with difficulties. Such devices, which include voice activated machines, computers and typewriters, typically seek to recognize, understand and/or respond to spoken language. Speech compressors seek to minimize the number of data bits required to encode digitized speech in order to minimize the cost of transmitting such speech over digital communication links. Hearing-aids seek to augment the hearing impaired's ability to extract information from speech and thus better understand conversations. Numerous other speech interpreting or responsive devices also exist.As disclosed herein, the difficulties encountered by these devices and their resulting poor performance stem from the fact that they incorporate principles of operation that are wholly unlike the operating principles of the human ear. Since such devices fail to incorporate an information extraction principle similar to that found in the ear, they are incapable of extracting and representing speech information in an efficient manner.Chappell in "Filter Technique Offers Advantages for Instantaneous Frequency Measurement" published in Microwave System News and Communications Technology, June, 1986, discloses the basic concept of channelized filter discriminators or ratio detectors. Chappell applies the technique to measuring the frequency of 

 individual radar pulses rather than speech and does not address measurement of combination of harmonics for frequency diversity processing. In addition, Chappell uses butterworth filters with a non-linear frequency discriminator curve rather than Gaussian filters, as is disclosed herein, with a perfectly linear discriminator curve or Gaussian/exact log discriminator curve.Morlet, et al. , in "Wavelet Propagation and Sampling Theory" published in Geophysics in 1982, discloses a filter bank with Gaussian filters equally spaced along a logarithmic frequency axis. The system is applied to seismic waves, rather than speech and does not address the measurement and combination of harmonics for frequency diversity processing.
