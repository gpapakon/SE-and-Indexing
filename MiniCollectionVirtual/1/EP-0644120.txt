<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for filling boxes or cases with 
layers stacked on top of each other and formed from 

substantially spherical articles arranged in a desired 
pattern. The apparatus comprises feed means, pattern forming 

means (2) for forming an article layer arranged in a desired 
pattern, pick-up means (4) for picking up the article layer as a 

whole and placing it in a box or case (5), the pattern forming 
means comprising a plurality of parallel paths (2a-2e), each path, 

adjacent to the in-feed side of the pattern forming means, 
comprising a conveyor track (6a-6e) whose discharge side connects to a 

series of rotatable, hourglass-shaped rollers (7), arranged behind 
each other and spaced apart at a pitch distance such that 

between two successive rollers a nest is present capable of 
receiving one article, the conveyor tracks and the hourglass-shaped 

rollers of each path being drivable independently of

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for filling boxes 
or cases with layers stacked on top of each other and formed 
from substantially spherical articles, such as for instance 
fruits, arranged in a desired pattern, the apparatus 
comprising feed means, an outlet of which connects to an inlet 
of pattern forming means for forming an article layer arranged 
in a desired pattern in a pick-up area, and pick-up means, 
movable in a horizontal and vertical plane, for picking up the 
article layer as a whole from the pick-up area and placing it 
in a box, for instance made of cardboard, or case. Such an apparatus is known for packing oranges from Dutch 
patent application 8103567. In the known apparatus, the 
pattern forming means are formed by a plurality of parallel 
chutes in an inclined plane, with a retaining element arranged 
in each chute. The articles are guided into the chutes and 
roll down in the inclined chute and run into the retaining 
element. A drawback of the known apparatus is that it only 
functions properly if the articles to be packed are 
substantially spherical and approximately of the same size. 
Another drawback of the known apparatus is that the articles 
may get damaged when they run into the retaining elements. In 
the case of oranges, which have rather a thick peel, this 
damage will not quickly occur. In the case of other fruits, 
such as for instance tomatoes, aubergines, apples and the 
like, the peel is much more vulnerable, so that the processing 
of these fruits by means of the known apparatus would 
inevitably lead to damage. A further drawback of the known 
apparatus is that it cannot exert any influence over the 
orientation of the fruits before they are picked up to be 
placed in the box or case. The object of the invention is to provide an apparatus 
without the above-mentioned drawbacks. To that end, the apparatus is characterized in that the 
pattern forming means comprise a plurality of parallel paths,  
 
each path having, adjacent to the in-feed side of the pattern 
forming means, a conveyor track whose discharge side connects 
to a series of rotatable, hourglass-shaped rollers, arranged 
behind each other and spaced apart at a pitch distance such 
that between two successive rollers a nest is present capable 
of receiving one article, the conveyor tracks and the 
hourglass-shaped rollers of each path being drivable 
independently of the conveyor tracks and rollers located in 
the other paths. The operation of the thus constructed apparatus is as 
follows. The

the hourglass-shaped rollers (7) of two adjoining paths 

(2a-2e) are staggered in longitudinal direction relative to 
each other, so that a center line of an hourglass-shaped 

roller (7) in one path (2a-2e) is in line with the center of a 
nest (8) in the adjoining path (2a-2e). 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the pick-up means (4) comprise at least a pick-up head 

(13) capable of moving upward and downward and attached to a
