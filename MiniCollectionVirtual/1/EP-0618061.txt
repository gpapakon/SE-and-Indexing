<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a method for crimping a thermoplastic 
member which allows a first member (1) made of 

thermoplastic resin to be mounted on a second member (2) at 
a high mounting strength without complicating the 

fabrication process and without causing any reduction 
in the production efficiency. After an entire portion 

of the first member (1A) that is to be crimped is thermally 
melted or softened, the portion is deformed and crimped 

by using a crimping die (3) having a die surface which is 
at a temperature lower the melting point of the 

thermoplastic resin. Therefore, the deformed portion 
is given with a uniform internal structure free from 

internal defects such as cracks and interfaces. 
Because the interior of the crimped portion remains to 

be hot as compared to the surface portion which is in 
contact with the crimping die during the crimping 

process, a certain pattern of internal stress is 

produced in the internal part which opposes the 
internal stress of the surface portion as the deformed 

portion cools and contracts. Therefore, warping of the 
crimped portion can be avoided, and the thermoplastic 

resin member can be mounted on the second member at a 
high mounting strength without complicating the 

fabrication process and without causing any reduction 
in the production efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
mounting a member made of thermoplastic resin on 
another member by crimping a part of the thermoplastic 
resin member, and an assembly made by this method. It has been conventionally known to mount a member 
made of thermoplastic resin on another member by 
crimping a part of the thermoplastic resin member, for 
instance, for mounting a ball seat made of plastic 
material on a housing in a ball joint assembly, 
attaching a clip seat made of plastic material to a 
sheet spring clip, embedding a metallic electrode in a 
molded member, and securing a reinforcement plate to a 
flange of a molded member. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 10, when 
mounting a solid cylindrical member 1 made of 
thermoplastic resin material on a plate member 2 at one 
of its longitudinal ends, a cylindrical projection 1a 
provided at the longitudinal end of the solid 
cylindrical member 1 and having a reduced diameter so 
as to serve as a portion to be crimped is fitted into a 
hole 2a provided in the plate member 2, and a crimping 
die 3 is pressed against this cylindrical projection 1a 
in the direction indicated by arrow A so that the 
cylindrical projection 1a is deformed so as to conform 
to a recess 3a of the crimping die 3 and thus form a 
crimped head portion 1a'. Referring to Figure 10, various methods of 
crimping (insert molding, cold crimping, hot crimping, 
thermal crimping, and ultrasonic crimping) were tested 
by using a cylindrical member 1 made of polyacetal  
 
copolymer thermoplastic resin having a projection 1a 4 
mm in diameter which is intended to be formed with a 
head portion 1a' 6 mm in outer diameter and 1.5 mm in 
height, in combination with a plate member 2 made of a 
steel plate having a sufficient rigidity. The results 
of the test are given in the following. When the plate member 2 is fixedly secured and the 
cylindrical member 1 is pulled in the direction 
indicated by arrow B as illustrated in Figure 10, the 
mechanical strength of the crimped portion (tensile 
rupture strength) can be theoretically given by the 
smaller one the values given by the following two 
equations. 
Shear rupture strength 
= area of shear stress x shear strength of the material 
= 4 mm x π x 1.5 mm x 5.4 kgf/mm2 
≈ 102 kgf Tensile rupture strength 
= area of tensile stress x tensile strength of the material 
= (4 mm/2)2 x π x 6.2 kgf/mm2 
≈ 78 kgf Because the actual mechanical strength is normally 
less than the theoretical value due to stress 
concentration and

A method for mounting a first member (1) made of 
thermoplastic resin on a second member (2) by crimping a part 

(1a) of said first member (1), comprising the steps of: 

passing a projection (1a) on a first member (1) through 
a hole (2a) provided in a second member (2);
