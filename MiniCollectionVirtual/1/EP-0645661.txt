<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal projection panel (10) having a liquid crystal display (20) 
sandwiched between a pair of microlens arrays (32, 34). The liquid crystal display 

and the microlens arrays are positioned between and spaced apart from a pair of 
polarizers (52, 54). This physical decoupling (72, 74) of the polarizers and 

microlens arrays ensures that the thermal contraction and expansion of the 
polarizers will not affect the registration between the pixels (26) in the liquid 

crystal display and the microlenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to liquid crystal displays, and more 
particularly to liquid crystal displays used as projection panels. Thin, lightweight liquid crystal displays have become popular for use in 
electronic presentation devices, computer displays, and entertainment devices. In 
particular, active matrix addressed liquid crystal displays (most commonly of the 
thin film transistor type) offer high information content, full color, high contrast, 
and fast video refresh rate. However, these liquid crystal displays suffer from low 
transmission, typically 3-5%, which necessitates high power backlights and 
reduced ambient lighting. A major factor in the low transmission is the aperture 
ratio of about 30-40% to accommodate space for transistors and bus lines on the 
display. Microlenses can be used to guide light through the apertures, thereby 
recovering most of the lost light, and increasing the transmission rate to about 6-15%. It would be desirable to have a liquid crystal display projection panel of the 
type described above, yet possessing improved transmission. Accordingly, the present invention includes a liquid crystal projection panel 
having a liquid crystal display sandwiched between a pair of microlens arrays. 
The liquid crystal display and the microlens arrays are positioned between and 
spaced apart from a pair of polarisers. This decoupling of the polarisers and the 
microlenses ensures that the thermal contraction and expansion of the polarizers 
will not affect the registration between the pixels in the liquid crystal display and 
the microlenses.  The FIGURE shows a schematic cross-sectional side view of a liquid 
crystal projection panel according to the present invention. A liquid crystal projection panel 10 according to the present invention is 
shown in the FIGURE. Projection panel 10 includes a liquid crystal display 20, 
which is comprised of a plurality of pixels 26 arranged regularly between two 
optically transparent substrates 22 and 24. Microlens arrays 32 and 34 are 
attached to the outer surfaces of substrates 22 and 24, respectively. Projection panel 10 also includes laminate structures 40 and 50, which are 
spaced from microlens arrays 32 and 34, respectively, by spacings 72 and 74, 
respectively. Laminated structure 40 is comprised of hard protective surface 62, 
polarizer 52, and optional fresnel lens 42. Similarly, laminated structure 50 is 
comprised of hard protective surface 64, polarizer 54, and optional fresnel lens 44.
