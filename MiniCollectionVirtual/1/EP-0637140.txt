<ABSTRACT>
Connection patterns as many as possible can be managed
by less standard patterns. Connected states of a VTR (30), a

VTR (40), a VTR (50), a VTR (60), an MDP (70), a tuner (80) and
an AV center (100) composing a standard pattern are memorized in

advance. A flag (N) representing the non-use is set to an AV
equipment (e.g., VTR (60)) that is not used in actual practice

of the AV equipments constructing the standard pattern.
Therefore, a system in which a part of the AV equipments

constructing the standard pattern is omitted can be managed
similarly to the system of the standard pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an audio-video system 
control method for use in controlling an audio-video system 
composed of a plurality of audio-video equipments. In an audio-video (referred to hereinafter as "AV" 
for simplicity) system, a VTR (video tape recorder), an MDP 
(multi-disc player), a television (TV) receiver, a speaker, 
etc., are connected to form a system. When a video disc is 
played back by the MDP, for example, and a reproduced signal 
from the video disc is supplied to the VTR so that the 
reproduced signal is recorded on a magnetic tape or the 
reproduced signal is output to and displayed by the television 
receiver, if an MDP playback command is issued, then the VTR and 
the television receiver are automatically energized to implement 
predetermined operations. Therefore, the user need not control 
respective AV equipments separately and the AV equipments become 
easier to handle. When the respective AV equipments in the AV system are 
controlled, it is customary that a predetermined AV equipment 
(e.g., television receiver) is used as an AV center to manage 
the connected states of the respective AV equipments 
constructing the AV system and the AV equipments are controlled 
by the AV center. The AV center uses a memory to memorize in advance 
data representing the AV equipments forming the AV system and  
 
the connected states of the AV equipments in order to manage the 
respective AV equipments and controls the AV equipments in 
accordance with the memorized data. However, inasmuch as the AV system memorizes in 
advance the standard pattern of the AV system and connects the 
AV equipments in accordance with the standard pattern in actual 
practice, if the AV system are connected with a pattern 
different from the standard pattern, there is then the problem 
that the respective AV equipments cannot be controlled 
functionally. To solve this problem, it is proposed that the AV 
system memorizes in advance standard patterns as many as 
possible. This proposal causes another problem because the 
storage capacity of the memory for memorizing standard patterns 
is increased as the number of the standard patterns is 
increased. As a result, the AV system becomes expensive. In view of the aforesaid aspect, it is an object of 
the present invention to provide an AV system control method in 
which connection patterns as many as possible can be managed 
without increasing the memory capacity. According to an aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided an audio-video system
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling an audio-video 
system in which predetermined connected states between an 

audio-video centre and a plurality of audio-video 
equipment are previously memorised in a table as standard 

patterns and said audio-video equipment is controlled in 
response to said standard patterns memorised in said 

table, comprising the steps of: 
   adding to said table a code representing whether 

or not said audio-video equipment included in said 
standard pattern is actually used in a system; and 

   controlling said audio-video equipment in 
response to information of said audio-video equipment on 

said table with said added code. 
A method for controlling an audio-video 
system in which predetermined connected states between an 

audio-video centre and a plurality of audio-video 
equipment are previously memorised in a table as standard 

patterns and said audio-video equipment is controlled in 
response to said standard patterns memorised in said 

table, comprising the steps of: 
   adding to said table a code representing whether 

or not a connection path of said audio-video equipment 
included in said standard pattern is actually realised; 

and 
   controlling said audio-video equipment in 

response to information of said audio-video equipment on 
said table with said added code.

wherein said standard pattern is a high-order connection 

configuration including a plurality of connection 
configurations of said audio-video centre and said audio-video 

equipment.

when said standard pattern is displayed on a display, said 

audio-video equipment used in actual practice is displayed 
on said display and said audio-video equipment that is

line representing the connected state of said audio-video 
centre and said audio-video equipment together with said 

audio-video equipment so that a connection line receiving 
attention can be distinguished from other connection lines 

when said standard pattern is displayed on said display. 
The method according to claim 1, 2 or 7, 
further comprising the steps of outputting a first signal 

to said audio-video centre and a target audio-video 
equipment that is to be confirmed as a connection object 

from said audio-video centre of a plurality of audio-video 
equipment, outputting a second signal from said target 

audio-video equipment to said audio-video centre and
