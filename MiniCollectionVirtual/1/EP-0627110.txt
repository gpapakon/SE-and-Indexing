<ABSTRACT>
A synchronisation pulse mixer converts the signals from the nine outputs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14) of a VGA card in such a way that only three coaxial cables (16, 17, 18) are required to retransmit them to a video switch or to a RGB monitor. This synchronisation pulse mixer is characterized in particular in that the electric energy required by the electronic circuit (20) which mixes the vertical and horizontal synchronisation pulses is directly tapped from the vertical and horizontal synchronisation pulses. An additional power supply may thus be dispensed with and the size of the synchronisation pulse mixer may be substantially reduced.

<CLAIMS>
Output circuit for a video adapter of a personal computer, in which sync 
pulses (13, 14) enter the output circuit, with a sync pulse mixer (20) which 

mixes an incoming colour signal (2) and the sync pulses from the output circuit 
on one and the same line, wherein
 
the sync pulse mixer (20) can be operated with electrical energy which is 

tapped from the sync pulses in the output circuit. 
Output circuit as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 
the energy from the horizontal (13) and the vertical sync pulses (14) is used.
