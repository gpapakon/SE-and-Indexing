<ABSTRACT>
A cable management system for use in a cabinet housing electronics 
and/or optical equipment located in a vertical array of horizontal racks comprises a 

vertical side wall (1) that can be located to one side of the racks, and has a plurality 
of cable holders (3) thereon. Each cable holder (3) extends from the front of the 

side wall (1) to a rear wall (2) of the system to allow a cable bundle to extend from 
the front of a rack to the rear wall, and each cable holder has a height that will 

accommodate sufficient slack cable bundle when its associated rack is in its normal 
operating position to enable the rack to be pulled out from the front of the cabinet 

by taking up the slack in the cable bundle. Preferably the cable holders (3) are in 
the form of enclosed pockets arranged in an array extending up the side wall, each 

pocket having openings (7,8) at its front and rear to allow the cable to extend 
through it and a side face that is removable to allow access to the cable. also clips 

may be provided along the rear wall to retain the cables against it. 
The system enables the cables to be readily accessible if work is need to be 
conducted on them with a reduced possibility of disrupting traffic on the other live 

cables.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cabinets for electronics (including optical) 
equipment and especially, although not necessarily, to cabinets for telephony racks. Such equipment is often based in cabinets having a plurality of equipment 
racks, usually arranged in a vertical array of horizontal racks, which can be located 
in a normal operating position within the cabinet and which can be pulled out from 
the front of the cabinet to a limited extent, to allow access to the equipment thereon. 
One example of such a cabinet may be found in a telephone exchange where arrays 
of optical fibre splices are provided on the racks of the cabinet. Optical cable 
bundles are typically routed into the rear of the cabinet and extend down the side of 
the cabinet to the appropriate rack, and as a consequence, the space in the cabinet to 
the side of the array of racks normally contains a tightly packed mass of cable. 
This can cause difficulties in the installation of cable or subsequent modification of 
the cable, especially if it is required to conduct this without disrupting traffic on any 
of the other cables. The present invention provides a cable management system for use in such 
cabinets, which comprises a vertical side wall that can be located to one side of the 
racks and has a plurality of cable holders thereon, each cable holder extending from 
the front of the side wall to a rear wall of the system to allow a cable bundle to 
extend from the front of a rack to the rear wall via a cable holder associated with 
the rack, each cable holder having a height that will accommodate sufficient slack 
cable bundle when its associated rack is in its normal operating position to enable  
 
the rack to be pulled out from the front of the cabinet by taking up the slack cable 
bundle. Preferably, the cable holders are in the form of enclosed pockets arranged 
in an array extending up the side wall of the system, each pocket having an opening 
at its front and its rear to allow the cable bundle to extend therethrough. In this 
case the pockets may have a face, directed into the space between the side wall and 
the racks, that is removable in order to allow access to the cable. In addition, the 
rear wall of the system may be provided with an array of cable clips in order to 
retain the cable bundles against the wall. The clips are preferably arranged so that 
the cable bundle from one cable holder extends up the rear wall at a small angle to 
the vertical in order to leave space for a cable bundle extending from the next 
high

<CLAIMS>
A cable management system for use in a cabinet housing electronics 
and/or optical equipment located in a vertical array of horizontal racks, which 

comprises a vertical side wall (1) that can be located to one side of the racks and 
has a plurality of cable holders (3) thereon, each cable holder (3) extending from 

the front of the side wall (1) to a rear wall (2) of the system to allow a cable bundle 
to extend from the front of a rack to the rear wall (2) via a cable holder (3) 

associated with the rack, and each cable holder having a height that will 
accommodate sufficient slack cable bundle when its associated rack is in its normal 

operating position to enable the rack to be pulled out from the front of the cabinet 
by taking up the slack in a cable bundle. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cable holders (3) are in the 
form of enclosed pockets arranged in an array extending up the side wall, each 

pocket having an opening (7) at its front and an opening (8) at its rear to allow the 
cable bundle to extend therethrough. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein each pocket has a face (5) 
directed into the space between the side wall and the racks, that is removable in 

order to allow access to the cable. 
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the rear wall (2) 
is provided with an array of cable clips in order to retain cable bundles against the 

wall. 
A system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the clips are arranged so that 
 

the cable bundle from one cable holder (3) extends up the rear wall (2) at a small 
angle to the vertical in order to leave space for a cable bundle extending from the 

next higher cable housing to be retained against the rear wall. 
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, for use with optical 
cables, wherein the cable holders (3) each have a bend limiting surface at the front 

and/or at the back in order to limit the bending of the cable bundles to a minimum 
radius.
