<ABSTRACT>
Mercury and mercury-containing compounds can be removed from soil, sand, and similar materials by a remediation method in which the contaminated material is treated with an aqueous composition comprising an oxidant, such as iodine, and a complexing or solubilizing agent, such as potassium iodine, the liquid and solid phases are separated, and further processed as needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the
remediation of mercury-contaminated materials and
compositions such as land fill materials, industrial
wastes, toxic or hazardous wastes, ground waters soil,
sand, gravel, building materials, and the like. More
particularly, the invention is directed to the
recovery of mercury from solid materials and aqueous
solutions by chemical extraction which may be followed
by subsequent regeneration of elemental mercury and
the extractant.Mercury is a serious environmental
contaminant. Its toxicity is intensified because it
forms compounds some of which have been found to
concentrate and remain in fatty tissue. Mercury can
persist in a number of chemical forms including
inorganic salts, organometallic compounds, and as
elemental mercury. The solubility of mercury
compounds in both aqueous and organic solvents varies
from extremely soluble to extremely insoluble.
Mercury-containing species can be either anionic or
cationic. It has been found to enter the environment
by a number of pathways including leaching from
mercury-containing alloys, evaporation of volatile
materials, application of various pesticides, and
improper disposal of industrial wastes.When in soil or other particulate material
mercury and its derivatives are bound quite tightly,
frequently to the organic portion. Such compounds
slowly leach into ground waters thereby spreading the
contamination to the water supply. Various techniques for the removal of toxic
metals such as cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel,
lead, and zinc from soils have been developed.
Generally, such methods involve mobilization of the
contaminant by washing with an aqueous composition
containing additives which increase the solubility of
metal or metal-containing compound thus making in-situ
and ex-situ flushing procedures possible. Generally,
water alone is not an effective method for removal of
mercury.Similar techniques have been employed for
the extraction of metals from their ores. Once in
the aqueous phase methods are available for isolating
and recovering the metal, including ion exchange
techniques and carbon adsorption.US-A-3,732,094 discloses a process for
recovering mercury from mercury-containing materials.
Mercury is extracted by using a leach agent formed in situ
by continuously injecting chlorine or bromine into an
aqueous slurry of the mercury-containing material, which
slurry also contains an alkali metal or alkali earth
compound.It is known that chloride containing salts,
synthetic and natural chelating agents, and certain
oxida

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing mercury from
mercury contaminated solid materials which comprises

treating the contaminated materials with an aqueous
extractant-composition comprising an oxidizing agent

and complexing agent, characterized by the oxidizing
agent consisting of iodine in an amount sufficient to

oxidize elemental mercury to the mercuric oxidation
state whereby mercuric compounds are produced, and

the complexing agent consisting of a water soluble
iodide in an amount sufficient to form a water-soluble

complex with said mercuric compounds, and
separating the aqueous extractant composition from

the solid materials.
The process of claim 1 in which the
water soluble iodide has the formula RX wherein R is

selected from the group consisting of potassium,
lithium, sodium, calcium, and ammonium and X is

iodide.
The process according to claim 1 in
which the extractant composition contains from

0.1 to 1 mole per liter of potassium iodide and
from 0.0001 to 0.5 moles of iodine per

liter.
The process of claim 1 in which the
extractant composition contains about 1 mole of 

potassium iodide and about one-half mole of iodine per
liter.
A process according to claim 1 for
removing elemental mercury and chemically combined

mercury from mercury-contaminated solid material which
comprises contacting the mercury-containing solid

material with an aqueous extractant composition
containing from 0.1 to 1 mole of potassium

iodide and from 0.0001 to 0.5 mole of
iodine per liter for a period of time sufficient to

solubilize substantially all of the mercury
contaminant, separating the solid material from the

mercury-containing extractant, and electrochemically
removing the mercury from the aqueous extractant to

regenerate a mercury-free aqueous extractant
composition.
