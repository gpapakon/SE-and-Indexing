<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to novel PCP derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens or receptors (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies or receptors to PCP and PCP analogue metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies or receptors using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONNovel Phencyclidine Derivatives and Protein andPolypeptide Phencvclidine DerivativeConjugates and LabelsField of the InventionThis invention is in the field of ligand receptor assays, including immunoassays, for the detection of selected metabolites of phencyclidine in a fluid sample. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for the synthesis of novel phencyclidine derivatives and protein and polypeptide phencyclidine derivative conju¬ gates and labels for use in the preparation of antibodies to phencyclidine metabolites and for use in the immuno- assay process.Background of the InventionPhencyclidine (PCP) was developed as an anesthetic for humans but has become a highly abused drug. The illi¬ cit use of PCP and PCP analogues, such as cyclohexamine , phenylcyclohexylpyrrolidine, phenylcyclopentylpiperidine and thienylcyclohexylpiperidine has resulted in a medical need for antibodies and diagnostics to rapidly detect the PCP and PCP analogue metabolites in order to monitor and treat PCP abuse. The preparation of antibodies to PCP and PCP ana¬ logues requires the synthesis of a PCP derivative in order to covalently attach the derivative to an antigenic poly¬ peptide or protein. In addition, the PCP derivative is covalently attached to various polypeptides, proteins or labels for use in screening antibodies and in the immuno- assay process. The PCP derivative should mimic the struc¬ ture of the PCP and PCP analogue metabolites sought to be measured. Therefore, the selection and synthesis of the types of PCP derivatives for covalent attachment to pro- teins, polypeptides or labels is critical. In addition, 

the PCP derivatives need to be stable to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution.PCP compounds and conjugates for immunization and immunoassay have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,281,065 and 4,446,065.Summary of the InventionThe present invention is directed to novel PCP deriv¬ atives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies to PCP and PCP analogue metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.DefinitionsIn accordance with the present invention and as used herein, the following terms, are defined with the -follow¬ ing meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
