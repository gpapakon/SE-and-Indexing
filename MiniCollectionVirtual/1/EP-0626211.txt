<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a masking member (2A) attached to an 
article (1), said article (1) having an aperture or indentation (11) 

formed in a surface thereof, at least part of said masking member (2A) 
forming an insertion portion  (21A), wherein said insertion portion 

(21A) is inserted into said aperture or indentation (11), characterised 
by said insertion portion (21A) having a first portion (29A) positioned 

substantially flush with at least part (1A) of said surface around said 
aperture or indentation (11) and having a second portion (22A) extending 

further into said aperture or indentation (11) away from that part of 
said first portion (29A) which is flush with said at least part (1A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a masking member for 
protecting a part of a surface of an article, for example, 
from a surface treatments such as application of a coating 
and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
masking member for attachment to a part to be masked which 
has an aperture or an indentation into which an insertion 
portion of the masking member is insertable. When a surface treatment is effected on the surface of 
an article, and if said surface of said article has a part or 
parts on which said surface treatment is not to be effected, 
said part or parts of said surface of said article may be 
fitted and protected with a masking member. Hitherto, for example, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a 
masking member 2 has been used to protect a bumper 1 from a 
coating material during the process of coating a car. In 
this case, said masking member 2 is attached to said bumper 
1 by fitting the insertion portion 21 of said masking member 
in the air intakes 11 and a bent over part 22 on the lower 
edge of said insertion portion 21 is fixed to the lower edge 
of said intakes 11 of said bumper 1 by means of an adhesive 
tape 3. Nevertheless, said bent-over part 22 on the lower edge 
of said insertion portion 21 tends to work away, bend upwards 
and thereby to become lifted from said lower edge of said air 
intakes 11 of said bumper 1 and thus attaching said adhesive  
 
tape is difficult, and work fitting said insertion portion 21 
of said masking member 2 into said air-intakes 11 of said 
bumper 1 is troublesome. According to one aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a masking member for attachment to an article 
which has an aperture or an indentation formed in a surface 
thereof, part at least of said masking member forming an 
insertion portion for insertion into the aperture or 
indentation, characterised by said insertion portion having 
a first portion for, in use, positioning substantially flush 
with at least part of the surface around the aperture or 
indentation and having a second portion arranged to extend, 
in use, further into the aperture or indentation away from 
that part of said first portion which is flush with the at 
least part. According to a further aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a masking member attached to an article, 
said article having an aperture or indentation formed in a 
surface thereof, at least part of said masking member forming 
an insertion portion, wherein said insertion portion is 
inserted into said

<CLAIMS>
A masking member (2A) for attachment to an 
article (1) which has an aperture or an indentation (11) 

formed in a surface thereof, part at least of said masking 
member (2A) forming an insertion portion (21A) for insertion 

into the aperture or indentation (11), characterised by said 
insertion portion (21A) having a first portion (29A) for, in 

use, positioning substantially flush with at least part (1A) 
of the surface around the aperture or indentation (11) and 

having a second portion (22A) arranged to extend, in use, 
further into the aperture or indentation (11) away from that 

part of said first portion (29A) which is flush with the at 
least part (1A). 
A masking member (2A) attached to an article (1), 
said article (1) having an aperture or indentation (11) 

formed in a surface thereof, at least part of said masking 
member (2A) forming an insertion portion (2A), wherein said 

insertion portion (21A) is inserted into said aperture or 
indentation (11), characterised by said insertion portion 

(21A) having a first portion (29A) positioned substantially 
flush with at least part (1A) of said surface around said 

aperture or indentation (11) and having a second portion 
(22A) extending further into said aperture or indentation 

(11) away from that part of said first portion (29A) which is 
flush with said at least part (1A). 
A method of masking an article (1) which has an 
 

aperture or indentation (11) formed in a surface thereof, by 
attaching a masking member (2A) to said article (1), said 

method comprising inserting into said aperture or indention 
(11) an insertion portion (21A) formed by at least part of 

said masking member (2A), characterised by positioning a 
first portion (29A) of said insertion portion (21A) 

substantially flush with at least part (1A) of said surface 
around said aperture or indentation (11) when said insertion 

portion (21A) has been inserted and a second portion (22A) 
extending further into the aperture or indentation (11) away 

from that part of said first portion (29A) which is flush 
with said at least part (1A). 
A masking member, or a masking member attached to 
an article, or a method, according to any one of the 

preceding claims, wherein said masking member (2A) is formed 
from a sheet. 
A masking member, or a masking member in 
combination with an article, or a method, according to any of 

the preceding claims, said masking member (2A) further having 
a third portion (28A) extending away from said first portion 

(22A) into the aperture or indentation. 
A masking member, or a masking member in 
combination with an article, or a method, according to claim 

5 wherein said second portion (22A) is generally parallel to 
said third portion (28A). 
A masking member, or a masking member in 
combination with an article, or a method, according to any 

 
one of the preceding claims, a surface of said second portion 

(22A) being arranged, in use, to contact part of a surface of 
the article (1) inside the aperture or indentation (11) when 

said insertion portion (21A) is inserted into the aperture or 
indentation (11).

(22A) is biased against a part of a or the surface of the 
article (1) inside the aperture or indentat
ion (11). 
A masking member, or a masking member in 
combination with an article, or a method, according to any 

one of the preceding claims, said masking member (2A) having 
ribs (23A,24A,25A,26A) for structural reinforcement.
