<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drive circuit for a 
stepper motor. The background to the invention lies in a 
different field. In our British Patent Application 
published under no. 2 236 887 
there are disclosed rotatable 
mechanical coin escrow mechanisms. These are intended 
to be driven by an electric motor which rotates the 
drum of the mechanism by an integral number of 
complete rotations so as to cause coins selectively to 
be delivered to a cashbox, or returned to a user. The 
number of coins present in the escrow mechanism when 
it is to be driven varies greatly, and so therefore 
does the inertia of the mechanism, this being rather 
small when only the empty plastic drum has to be 
rotated but two or more times as great when the drum 
is carrying its maximum number of coins. The amount 
of friction to be overcome, both in the bearings of 
the drum and between the coins and the drum, also 
varies considerably. A feasible, and conventional, system for rotating 
the drum would be a small high-speed DC electric motor 
driving the drum through a large reduction ratio 
gearbox, in conjunction with an indexing system such  
 
as an optically-sensed tooth wheel, for the purpose of 
detecting absolute drum position. Low cost is an essential requirement in the 
applications for which such escrow mechanisms are 
intended, such as pay telephones, and a further 
requirement in that context is for the drive power to 
be derived from the telephone line. Cheap, high-speed (say 3000 rpm) DC electric 
motors do not have sophisticated and therefore 
relatively expensive very low friction bearings, and 
relatively high frictional losses are also 
characteristic of cheap high reduction ratio 
gearboxes. It is therefore very difficult to produce 
cheap drive systems of the above kind which will have 
a sufficiently low power consumption (typically less 
than 100 mW) to permit their operation from telephone 
lines. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a low-cost, low power consumption, electric drive 
system. The present invention involves the realisation 
that a stepper motor could beneficially be used to 
drive such a coin escrow because its inherently low 
rotational speed means that friction losses in its own 
bearings are small, and also that a gearbox of much 
smaller reduction ratio can be used so that friction  
 
losses in the gearbox can also be reduced. Various drive circuits for stepper motors are 
known, for controlling the application of the 
necessary drive pulses to the motor windings, but
