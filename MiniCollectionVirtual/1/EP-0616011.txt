<ABSTRACT>
A curable resin composition comprises (A) a silicone resin having epoxy 
and phenyl groups and at least two hydrolyzable silyl groups and/or silanol 

groups in one molecule, (B) a vinyl polymer having a group or groups reactive 
with the epoxy group in the ingredient (A), and (C) a condensation catalyst for 

the silicone resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a curable resin composition which is capable of 
yielding a cured film which is resistant to acid and exhibits a good appearance. As studies on the influence of acid rain have been prosecuted, it has been 
found that acid rain not only presents an ecological problem, but also adversely 
influences coatings, such as for motor vehicles, for which good appearance is 
required. More particularly, acrylic resins have been usually employed as 
coatings of motor vehicles wherein melamine resins are used as a curing agent 
for the acrylic resins. It has been found that the melamine resins are very 
susceptible to hydrolysis with acid rain. For the past several years, novel types of coating materials have been 
developed and applied as a topcoating for motor vehicles in place of acrylic-melamine 
resin compositions in order to cope with the problem caused by acid 
rain. For instance, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 1-139653 
proposes a curing coating composition which comprises a carboxyl group-containing 
acrylic resin and an epoxy resin or which comprises a carboxyl 
group-containing acrylic resin and an epoxy group-containing acrylic resin. 
Moreover, there have been proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application  
 
Nos. 62-187749 and 61-60748 curing coating compositions comprising carboxyl 
group-containing resins or amino group-containing resins and 
γ-glycidopropyltrialkoxysilanes. As is known in the art, the mechanism of curing between carboxyl and 
epoxy groups has been extensively studied. In fact, this curing system ensures 
a good acid resistance and has been recently put into practice in place of 
melamine curing systems. The curing reactions between the carboxyl group-containing 
acrylic resins and γ-glycidopropyltrialkoxysilanes include further 
reactions with siloxanes in addition to the above-mentioned reaction between 
the carboxyl and epoxy groups. In general, the surfaces wetted with acid rain become more acidic during 
the course of drying. The cured coating products obtained through the above 
curing reaction mechanisms have not been accepted as having a satisfactory 
resistance to acid rain. It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a curable resin 
composition which can yield a cured film or coating or product which is 
resistant to acid and has a good appearance. It is another object of the invention to provide a cured coating or film 
obtained from the composition. The above objects of the invention can be achieved, according to the
