<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to highly water 
absorbed rice produced by a process comprising a first 

step of turning immersed rice into water absorbed rice 
at a water content of 42 to 72 parts by weight to 100 

parts by weight of rice by using hot water no less than 65°C 
and/or steam or pressurized steam, a second step of 

immersing the resulting water absorbed rice into cold 
water at 0 to 25°C, preferably 5 to 15°C while the rice 

is in the state where the temperature of the rice is 
nearly maintained at the temperature of the hot water, 

and/or steam and the like for use in the above heating 
of the rice, to generate water absorbed rice at a water 

content of 50 to 85 parts by weight of water to 100 
parts by weight of raw rice, and a third step of 

charging the water absorbed rice into warm water at 25 

to 60°C, preferably 30 to 55°C to adjust the water 
content to 75 to 110 parts by weight of water to 100 

parts by weight of raw rice. 
In accordance with the present invention, the 
generation of turbidity due to micro-particles of starch 

can be successfully reduced by immediately immersing 
the rice from the first step into cold water at a 

temperature of 0 to 25°C, preferably 5 to 15°C at the  
 

second step while the rice maintains the heating 
temperature of the first step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is to provide rice 
pretreated with a water absorption process. The highly 
water absorbed rice or the ultra-highly water absorbed 
rice, in accordance with the present invention, can 
produce delicious boiled rice through simple heating at 
home, super markets, Japanese food restaurants and other 
restaurants. In accordance with the present invention, it has 
been found that the process of producing highly water 
absorbed rice proposed previously (PCT/JP93/00134) has 
one drawback. The previous process of producing the highly 
water absorbed rice comprises a first step of making 100 
parts by weight of rice absorb 45 to 100 parts by weight 
of water, charging the rice into warm water at a 
temperature above 25°C, and subjecting the rice to any 
one of processes including refrigeration, freezing,  
 
freezing after refrigeration and refrigeration after 
freezing, and a second step of further making the rice 
absorb water to adjust the total water absorption level 
to a ratio of 72 to 130 parts by weight of water to 100 
parts by weight of rice. When the rice is immersed in 
warm water above 25°C, micro-particles of starch disperse 
into the water, rapidly turning the water turbid. Thus, 
fresh warm water above 25°C has to be charged therein to 
exchange the water, so as to prevent the starch particles 
from adhering to rice surfaces and reducing water absorption. 
Additionally it was found that the productivity of the 
highly water absorbed rice was reduced. In accordance with the present invention, the 
generation of the turbidity due to micro-particles 
of starch can be successfully reduced 
by immediately immersing the rice into cold 
water at 0 to 25°C, preferably 5 to 15°C at the second 
step of the process of producing highly water absorbed 
rice while maintaining the heating temperature of the 
first step. The process of producing highly water 
absorbed rice or/and ultra-highly water absorbed rice 
can be made into a continuous through process, which 
enables almost no reduction of the productivity of such  
 
rice. The above advantages bring about the marked 
improvement in the industrial productivity together with 
the reduction in construction costs and running costs. The present invention essentially relates to 
highly water absorbed rice produced by a process 
comprising a first step of turning immersed rice into 
water absorbed rice at a water content of 42 to 72 parts 
by weight to 100 parts by weight of raw rice by using hot 
water no less than 65°C and/or steam or
