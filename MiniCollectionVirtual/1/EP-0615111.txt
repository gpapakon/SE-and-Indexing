<ABSTRACT>
A sensor, particularly a crankshaft or camshaft sensor for internal combustion engines, preferably a "HARTIG" sensor (WIG), can be used for measuring in the static case of operation by the fact that the threshold value or values determined in an analysing circuit are transferred to a non-volatile memory and are transmitted back to the analysing circuit when operation is begun again so that the sensor signal can be analysed before a new engine start when the internal combustion engine is still stationary.

<CLAIMS>
Crankshaft or camshaft signal transmitter for
motor vehicle internal combustion engines,


with a rotatable transmitter part (1) provided with at
least one tooth or segment (1a) and at least one tooth

or segment gap (1b),
with a stationary pickup (2) which is designed in such
a way that with the supply voltage switched on, a

sensor signal (s) associated with the tooth or segment
(1a) or gap (1b) of the transmitter part (1) which

lies opposite said stationary pickup is generated,
even before the internal combustion engine is started,

and
with an evaluation circuit (3,3a,3b) which is designed

in such a way that at least one threshold value (r) is
formed in it from the sensor signals and the sensor

signal (s) is converted into a digital transmitter
signal (g) by comparison with this threshold value or

values (r),

characterized in that the crankshaft or camshaft signal
transmitter is designed in such a way that the threshold

value or values (r) is/are transferred to a non-volatile
memory (4) at periodic intervals or at the end of

operation of the internal combustion engine and, when
operation begins again, i.e. when the supply voltage is

switched on, is/are transferred back into the evaluation
circuit (3,3a,3b) before the internal combustion engine

is started.
Signal transmitter according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the evaluation circuit (3) and the

non-volatile memory (4) are contained in a
microprocessor.
