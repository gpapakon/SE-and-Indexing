<ABSTRACT>
An orifice discharge device (1) is provided for use in crop spraying aircraft (10) to provide a downward spray of treatment substance especially liquid for crop or ground treatment. The device comprises an inlet air passage (4) with a bell mouth, and a discharge pipe (6) extending laterally relative to the inlet passage, a elbow portion (7) being provided between the inlet passage (4) and the discharge pipe (6). Treatment substance (liquid) is supplied by a supply conduit (9) to the elbow portion (7) for discharge into the pipe via a discharge nozzle (9A) of the supply conduit. In use, the inlet portion (4) receives a horizontal flow of air and a high velocity downwards discharge of air with treatment substance (liquid particles) occurs from the outlet of the pipe (6). The device is preferably of streamline form.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Device for Liquid and Solid Delivery From Crop Spraying AircraftThe present invention relates to a device for . liquid and solid delivery from crop spraying aircraft.The present invention provides for an improved method of directing and delivering fertilizer, herbicides, irrigation water and other toxic or non- toxic chemical sprays from an inflight aircraft crop spraying system such that the residual velocity of the liquid droplets, atomised vapours and solids is sensibly downwards at high velocities on leaving the slipstream disturbance area of the spraying aircraft and does not have any significant horizontal component of velocity due to the aerodynamic turbulence of the propulsion system of the aircraft.It is also a feature of this invention that the droplets and/or solid particles may be accelerated to subsonic, sonic or supersonic velocities using a minor portion of the energy of forward motion of the aircraft at normal flying speeds to this effect. Supersonic delivery velocity will be provided where the height of the flight path above the crops and the droplet size precludes leaf damage due to impact of the droplets etc.According to the present invention there is provided a discharge device for use in discharging treatment substance (e.g. liquid) onto a crop or ground from a crop spraying aircraft, the device being adapted for mounting on an aircraft, said device comprising a conduit member providing an air passage, and supply means for supplying treatment substance to said air passage, said passage including an inlet portion to receive air due to forward movement of the aircraft, and an outlet portion set at an angle relative to said inlet portion for directing a downward discharge of said air together with said treatment substance.Essentially the apparatus according to the invention is one or a number of such devices susoendedSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

from the wings or spray boom of an aircraft and preferably comprises a bell form inlet mouth leading to said inlet portion of the air passage, an elbow being present between the inlet and outlet portions. There is provided a smooth change of direction in the orifice device such that the included angle between the direction of the bell mouth and the exit lies normally between 90° and 45°. The bell mouth inlet will be sensibly aligned in the direction of the aircraft flight while the exit from the device will be usually, but not necessarily exclusively, downwards and inclined forward of the vertical by an angle variable according to the aircraft velocity

Claims
1. A discharge device for use in discharging treatment substance (e.g. liquid) onto a crop or ground from a crop spraying aircraft, the device being adapted for mounting on an aircraft and including treatment substance supply means, characterised in that said device comprises a conduit member (2) providing an air passage (4, 6, 7), said supply means (9) supplying treatment substance to said air passage (4, 6, 7), said passage including an inlet portion (4) to receive air due to forward movement of the aircraft, and an outlet portion (6) set at an angle relative to said inlet portion (4) for directing a downward discharge of said air together with said treatment substance.
2. The device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the outlet portion (6) communicates with the inlet portion (4) via an elbow portion (7) of the air passage.
3. The device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the supply means (9) include a nozzle inlet (9A) .
4. The device as claimed in claim 3 when dependent on claim 2, characterised in that the nozzle form inlet (9A) discharges at the elbow portion (7) of the air passage.
5. The device as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the outlet portion (6) of the air passage has a length which is a multiple of the width of the air passage.
6. The device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the distance from the nozzle form inlet (9A) to the discharge from the air passage outlet portion (6) is at least three times the cross-sectional width of the inlet portion (4) of the air passage.
7. The device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the elbow portion (7) is of rectangular cross-section, and in that arcuate guide vanes (Vι_ to V
4
) are present in the neck portion (7, for improved flow through the neck portion.
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


8. The device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that the inlet portion (4) is also of rectangular cross- section while at least a part (6A) of the outlet portion (6) is of circular cross-section, and in that a transitional portion (6B) is present for a smooth transition in shape between the rectangular elbow portion (7) and the circular part (6A) of the outlet portion (6) .
9. The device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the inlet potion (4) is of diverging form while the outlet portion (6) is of converging form, and in that a relatively small diameter throat (15) is present between said inlet and outlet portions (4, 6) .
10. The device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the inlet portion (4) has a bell mouth form inlet (3) .
11. The device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the conduit member (2) is of streamline form.
12. The device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the outlet portion (6) comprises a pipe extending laterally from the conduit member (2) .
