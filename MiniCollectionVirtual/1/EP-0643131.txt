<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for sample 
collection and 
in vitro
 transport for diagnostic use, 
of the type comprising a test tube containing 

transport medium in gel form and a rod bearing at one 
of its ends a cap for sealing said test tube and, at 

its opposite end, means for collecting said sample to 
be dipped into said transport medium, characterized in 

that said test tube has an essentially cylindrical 
shape interrupted by a neck situated in the nearby of 

the level reached inside the test tube by the free 
surface of the transport medium in gel form.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the field of clinical and diagnostic tests,
swabs with transport medium for collecting and
transporting aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, are
known. In general, these are systems comprised of a
collecting rod with a fiberous nose and a test tube
which contains, at its bottom, the transport medium,
in gel form.In the oldest systems, the gel which constitutes
the medium is contained inside a glass vial, inside
the interior of which the rod is broken after sample
collecting.The nearly total filling of the vial with the
medium secures that the swab will be totally dipped
inside the gel, even if during its transport, the vial
undergoes impacts or overturning.The poor practicalness of this system, and the
contamination risk caused only those systems to be
practically successful on the market, in which the
sample collection rod is constrained to a plug, so
that, after sample collection, the test tube which
contains the medium can be closed by the cap provided
on the swab rod.In this way, the rod needs not be fractured after
being dipped into the gel. However, the cap system is
exposed to the following drawbacks.During the transport, in particular when it is
carried out by mail service, it is very likely that
the test tubes suffer shocks and impacts, which may 
even be considerably strong, such as to cause the gel
to get detached from the bottom and the walls of the
test tube. The ultimate effect of such an occurrence
is that the gel is fragmented into a plurality of
particles, with it being consequently possible that
the transport medium moves away from the region in
which the nose of the sample bearing rod is.Such a phenomenon of axial flow of the gel inside
the test tube can cause the actual gel conditions to
diverge, to a determining extent, from the conditions
of survival of the microorganisms in the sample, thus
causing the test to become unreliable.A test tube containing a transport medium and a rod
bearing, on opposite ends, a cap for sealing the test
tube and means for collecting a sample, wherein the
test tube has essentially cylindrical shape interrupted
by a neck near the surface of the transport medium is
disclosed in documents FR-A-2,248,013 (claims 1 and 5;
figure 5), US-A-4,707,450 (column 2, lines 5-16; column
6, paragraphs 2-4; figures 10-13) and EP-A-58,008
(figures 1 and 4).One can hence realize how the devices of known
type are not capable of securing a permanent and
continuous contact between the sample collecting swab
and the medium in gel form during the transport, and,
therefore,

Device for sample collection and

transport for diagnostic use, of the type comprising
a test tube containing transport medium in gel form

and a rod bearing at one of its ends a cap for sealing
said test tube and, at its opposite end, means for

collecting said sample to be dipped into said
transport medium, 
characterized in that
 said test tube
has an essentially cylindrical shape interrupted by a

neck situated
under the level reached by the free

surface of the transport medium inside the test tube.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said neck comprises a downwards taper, of conical
shape, of the cylindrical section of said test tube.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said neck is provided with strengthening ribs.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said neck is constituted by a change in cross
section of the test tube comprised between a downwards

oriented taper and an upwards oriented taper.
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 said neck essentially consists in a change in the
cylindrical cross-section of the test tube, as

determined by a downwards-directed conical taper which
defines a separation zone between a longer-radius

circular cross-section and an underlying shorter-radius
circular cross-section along the longitudinal

axis of the test tube, with, from said shorter-radius
cross-section, the cross-section of the test tube 

sharply turning back into the initial, Longer-radius
cross-section on a perpendicular plane to the

longitudinal axis of said test tube.
