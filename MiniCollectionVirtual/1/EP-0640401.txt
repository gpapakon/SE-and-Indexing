<ABSTRACT>
A spray nozzle assembly (10) particularly adapted 
for directing a finely atomized slurry of hydrated 

lime for removing sulfur dioxide from flue gases. 
The nozzle assembly includes a nozzle body (14) having 

a first pre-atomizing and mixing chamber (30) into 
which pressurized liquid and air flow streams are 

directed for breaking down and pre-atomizing the 
liquid, an orifice plate (40) at the downstream end of 

the first pre-atomization and mixing chamber for 
restricting the fluid flow into a second chamber (42) 

defined by the orifice plate and spray tip, and a spray 
tip (18) having a plurality of circumferentially spaced 

discharge orifices (55) through which atomized liquid 
particles in the second chamber discharge. Each 

discharge orifice (55) is inclined at a compound angle 
in order to cause the spray to discharge from the tip 

as a swirling annular curtain and thereby retard the 
build up of lime and fly ash on the tip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to spray 
nozzles, and more particularly, to spray nozzles of 
the type that are utilized for spraying lime slurries 
in gas desulfurization systems. It is known to spray slurries of hydrated lime 
into the discharging flue gases from coal powered 
furnaces or boilers, such as in electric power plants, 
for the purpose of capturing, reaction with, and 
removing sulfur dioxide from the gases prior to 
discharge to the atmosphere. To effectively scrub 
sulfur dioxide from such gases, it is necessary that 
the slurry be finely atomized into small liquid 
droplets. It also is desirable that spray particles 
be of such small size in order to enhance drying prior 
to impinging upon the flue duct work so as to prevent 
build-up and corrosion. Vidusek United States Patent 5,176,325 discloses 
a spray nozzle assembly which overcomes many of the 
problems of prior spraying systems in that the nozzle 
assembly of the patent is capable of effectively 
discharging a finely atomized slurry of hydrated lime 
with low air consumption requirements and with reduced 
wear to exposed surfaces of the nozzle. In some 
installations, however, lime and fly ash build up 
rather rapidly on the center portion of the exposed 
face of the nozzle tip and detrimentally affect the 
spraying action. Attempts to solve the build-up 
problem by shrouding the external portion of the tip 
or by directing a stream of shielding air around the  
 
tip are relatively expensive and have met with only 
limited success. The general aim of the present invention is to 
provide a new and relatively inexpensive spray nozzle 
capable of discharging a finely atomized slurry of 
hydrated lime or the like without experiencing 
significant build-up of material on the nozzle tip. A further object of the invention is to achieve 
the foregoing by providing a nozzle tip formed with 
uniquely angled discharge orifices which effect 
swirling of the spray emerging from the tip into an 
annular curtain to help prevent lime and other 
material from building up on the tip. The invention also resides in inclining each discharge 
orifice at compound angles of such magnitude as 
to enable the orifices to produce effective swirling 
of the spray while permitting practical manufacture of 
the nozzle tip. These and other objects and advantages of the 
invention will become more apparent from the following 
detailed description when taken in conjunction with 
the accompanying drawings. FIGURE 1 is a vertical section showing one
