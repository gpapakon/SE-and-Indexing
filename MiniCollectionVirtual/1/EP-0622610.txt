<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended for the calibration of a system for measuring the thickness profile of flat products, for example metal sheets, which includes a radiation source (10), for example an X-ray source, and a row (20) of elementary detectors (21) aligned in the direction (P) of the profile to be measured, these being placed on either side of a zone (2) through which the said product passes. The device includes a set (32) of shims (33) having different characteristics, and a carriage (30) for supporting the shims which move in this direction. In order to carry out the calibration, the set of shims is moved in the passage zone so that each shim can intercept the radiation emitted by the source in the direction of each detector and, as the carriage moves, several readings are made of the signals emitted by the detectors so as to obtain, for each detector, a set of values of the signals representative of the intensity of the radiation absorbed by each shim, and, from these values, the calibration curve of each sensor is obtained.

Method of calibrating an assembly for measuring
the transverse thickness profile of a flat product,

including a source (10) of radiation, placed on one side
of the product (1), and a row (20) of elementary

detectors (21) which are juxtaposed and aligned along the
direction (P) of the profile to be measured and are

placed on the other side of the product, in order to
detect that part of the radiation not absorbed by the

product, the method being of the type consisting in
interposing, between the source (10) and the detectors

(21), standard shims (33) and in determining the response
of said detectors as a function of the characteristics of

these shims, characterized in that:

a set (32) of different unitary shims (33), of
small dimensions, aligned along said direction, are

moved, between the source and the detectors, along said
direction (P), each shim having predetermined specific

characteristics, this movement being performed so that,
while the latter is proceeding, each shim intercepts the

radiation picked up by each detector, and
while it is moving, a plurality of readings of
the signals (50) emitted by the detectors is taken so as

to obtain, for each detector, a set of values of the
signals representing the intensity of the radiation

absorbed by each shim, both the speed of movement of the
set of shims and the frequency of the readings being

adjusted so that, for each detector, there is at least
one reading of the signals relating to each shim, and
the calibration curve of each detector is
established on the basis of said values.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, for each detector, a plurality of readings of the

signals relating to the same shim is taken.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the position of the set (32) of shims with respect

to the row of detectors is determined, at the time of
each reading, on the basis of the signals (50) read from

the set of detectors.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the position of the set of shims is determined by

the position, within the row of detectors, of neighbouring
detectors which, during a reading, supply highly

differentiated signals resulting from an abrupt transition
in the absorption of the radiation between a predefined

element of the set of shims, or of a support (31)
for this set, and the neighbourhood of this element.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that said abrupt transition is produced by the free edge

(36, 37) of a frame (31) for supporting the shims (32)
which strongly absorbs the radiation, whereas, beyond

this edge, the radiation reaches the detectors in its
entirety.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, during each reading, only

the signals which reach the detectors located, during
this reading, facing the central part of the shims are

employed.
Device for calibrating an assembly for measuring
the thickness profile of flat products, which includes a

source (10) of radiation and a row (20) of elementary
detectors (21) which are juxtaposed and aligned along the

direction (P) of the profile to be measured, both the
source and the row of detectors being placed on either

side of a zone (2) for passage of said product, characterized
in that it includes a set (32) of shims (33)

having different characteristics, these shims being
aligned along said direction, a carriage (30) for supporting

the shims, which is movable along this direction
in order to move the set of shims into the passage zone 

so that each shim can intercept the radiation emitted by
the source towards each detector, and means (22) for

taking, while the carriage is moving, a plurality of
readings of the signals emitted by the detectors so as to

obtain, for each detector, a set of values of the signals
representing the intensity of the radiation absorbed by

each shim, and means (23) for determining the calibration
curve of each sensor on the basis of these values.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the shims are supported by the carriage by means of

a frame (31) to which the shims are attached in a contiguous
manner.
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the edge (36, 37) of the frame (31) serves as a

reference for the determination of the position of the
shims with respect to the detectors.
