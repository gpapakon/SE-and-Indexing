Apparatus for granulating plastics materials, 
having a fixed housing (1), which is flange-mountable on a 

granulating feedhead, and a cutter shaft (7), on which a 
cutter head (12) is disposed, cutting blades (13) being 

secured on the hub of said cutter head and lying with its 
cutting edge (13a) on a cutting plate (3), the cutter 

shaft (7) being mounted at one end in a bore formed in the 
housing (1) for receiving said shaft and being mounted at 

the other end in a bearing sleeve (10), with which it is 
longitudinally axially displaceable by means of a hydraulic 

cylinder unit, characterised in that the cutting blades 
(13) are connected to the hub of the cutter head (12) by 

means of a coupling joint connection, which is formed by 
two rocker arms (15, 16), disposed coaxially with each 

other and above each other, in such a manner that, 
independently of the particular contact pressure, a 

parallel position of the cutting edges (13a) of the cutting 
blades (13) relative to the cutting plate (3) is ensured. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the coupling joint connection is formed by plate-like, 

polygonal or star-shaped rocker arms (15, 16). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the rocker arms (15, 16) are formed by rod-like 

carrier elements, which are coaxially disposed above each 
other and are individually secured on the cutting blades 

(13) . 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that, to produce or reinforce the cutter contact pressure, 

the rocker arms (15, 16) are secured to at least one of the 
component parts (hub or cutting blade 13), which act as 

couplers, in a firmly clamped-in position.
