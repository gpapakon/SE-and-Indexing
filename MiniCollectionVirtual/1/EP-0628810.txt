<ABSTRACT>
The gas trace measurement system consists of an electrochemical sensor (1) having at least one working electrode, one back electrode and, if required, a reference electrode. The measurement signal generated by the sensor and correlated with the gas concentration is amplified and indicated with the aid of analogue evaluation electronics (2). The evaluation electronics (2) are connected to a diagnostic circuit (4, 5, 6) which, during a test cycle, temporarily alters the potential set up, in the case of a two-electrode sensor between the working electrode and the back electrode and, in the case of a three-electrode sensor, between the working electrode and the reference electrode, according to a predetermined time function, which produces a change in the current signal at the working electrode. This alteration of the current signal, or else a measurement value derived therefrom, is picked up by the evaluation electronics as a test signal which is representative of the sensor quality and is compared with one or more predetermined target values.
