<ABSTRACT>
The waveguide comprises a set of modular elements that 
are mutually connected by junction means; each element 

includes multiple hollow ducts (12) arranged edgeways and 
mutually spaced inside a metal casing (11) that acts as 

a supporting structure and as a protective conductor. The 
ducts (12) of each waveguide element are of the double-cavity 

type and are supported, in a mutually spaced 
arrangement, by insulating supports (13) individually 

formed by the adjacent arrangement of a plurality of 
spacers (14) that have enlarged heads (15) through which 

respective securing bolts (17) pass; the bolts (17) pack 
the spacers (14) together to clamp the ducts (12) and 

simultaneously connect the supports (13) to a pair of 
oppositely arranged walls (18-19) of the casing (11); the 

casing is completed by a lower and an upper closing plates 
(24-25) provided with or without a grille.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-ventilated 
modular waveguide for carrying and distributing low- and 
medium-voltage electric power with nominal operating 
voltages up to 1000 V and with nominal capacities of 0.2 to 
6 kA. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
waveguide of the type including a set of modular elements 
that are mutually connected by junction means; each element 
includes a plurality of adjacent ducts which are air-insulated 
and accordingly mutually spaced, and are arranged 
edgeways inside a metal casing that acts as a supporting 
structure and as a protection conductor. Furthermore, in the waveguide according to the present 
invention the ducts are of the double-cavity type described 
in European patent application no. 93104333.5 filed on 
March 17, 1993, which allow to produce waveguides which 
have different nominal capacities whilst having unchanged 
external dimensions since the useful section of the ducts 
is increased or decreased by varying the thickness of each 
duct toward the inside of the cavities. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
waveguide of the specified type that has an extremely 
simplified and therefore economically advantageous 
structure. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
waveguide in which the junction means of the different 
waveguide elements are entirely contained within the 
protective casing, which thus has a continuous profile and 
can be formed with continuous manufacturing methods, such  
 
as roll forming and the like, which are economical and 
suitable for mass-production. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a waveguide as specified, wherein the installation of the 
junction means and the mutual connection of the various 
waveguide elements is on one hand facilitated and on the 
other hand is such that it offers full assurance of a 
correct electrical connection of the ducts. A further object of the invention is to improve the 
profile of the hollow ducts in order to allow a wider 
variation in their useful section with equal external 
dimensions. With these objects and others in view, which will 
become apparent from the following detailed description, 
there is provided, according to the present invention, a 
self-ventilated modular waveguide wherein the hollow ducts 
of each waveguide element are supported, so that they are 
mutually spaced, by insulating supports formed by means of 
the adjacent arrangement of a plurality of spacers, each 
spacer having opposite T-shaped heads
