<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transmission and reception of 
data and voice signals, and more particularly to a mobile telephone 
unit which is adapted to be connected to a computer for 
transmitting data signals between the computer and a telephone 
system. It is desirable to connect a computer (e.g. a laptop or 
portable computer) to a telephone system for a variety of reasons 
such as for sending and receiving fax messages, electronic mail and 
paging messages. A variety of devices have been designed which 
perform such a function. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,020,090 
discloses an apparatus for removably connecting a cellular portable 
telephone to a laptop or portable computer. The apparatus includes 
a track formed in the housing of the computer and is structured to 
slidably receive a cellular portable telephone whose battery pack 
has been removed. U.S. Patent No. 5,043,721 discloses a paging 
accessory for portable computing devices such as calculators, 
electronic notebooks, calendars or the like. The paging accessory 
includes a board on which is mounted a receiver for receiving page 
signals and a microprocessor for identifying and decoding a page 
signal intended for the accessory. The board includes connectors 
for inserting the accessory into a port of a portable computing 
device. Alternatively, the receiver may be incorporated directly 
into a device. The device is programmed to compare information in 
its memory such as a received phone number against a list of 
phone numbers to identify the person to be called in response to 
the page. In addition, an optional modem may be mounted on the 
board so as to allow the device to send pages in the form of text 
messages. U.S. Patent No. 5,189,632 describes a portable 
computer telephone device which includes a portable personal 
computer and a mobile phone integrated into one. While it is known to use a mobile telephone, such as a 
cellular telephone, to connect a computer to a telephone system, 
heretofore, mobile phones could not connect a computer to a  
 
telephone system unless the computer had a built-in modem or 
unless an external stand-alone modem was connected to the 
computer via an external input/output data port of the computer. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simplified 
apparatus for enabling a computer to communicate with a 
telephone system. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided an apparatus for communicating with a telephone 
system, comprising a computer
