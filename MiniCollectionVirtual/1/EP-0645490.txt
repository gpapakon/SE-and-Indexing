<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device in 
the operation of a doctor blade in a paper machine / board 

machine. In the solution, in connection with 
the doctor blade (11), different quantities of lubricating 

medium are supplied into different areas of 
width of the doctor blade, a larger amount of lubricating 

medium being supplied into the area in which 
the maximum extent of wear of the doctor blade had 

been noticed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of 
lubricating a doctor blade applied against the outer surface of a roll in a paper machine / board 
machine according to the preamble of claim 1, and a roll provided with a doctor and means for applying a lubricating medium on the outer surface of the roll according to the preamble of claim 5. The doctor blades on the centre roll of the press are 
worn one-sidely. This comes from a number of reasons, 
which vary in the cross direction of the machine. 
Uneven wear is affected, e.g. by the temperature, air 
flows, etc. factors. Uneven wear rapidly results in 
replacement of the doctor blade. The wear of the blade 
is measured, and when the wear exceeds a permitted 
maximal wear, the blade is replaced. Thus, if the wear 
of the blade can be made more uniform, it is possible 
to extend the service life of the blade and to 
increase the interval of replacement. At present, the 
lubrication jets of doctors are designed symmetric. 
However, it has been noticed that, in view of 
equalization of the wear of blades, a larger amount of  
 
lubricant should be introduced in the portion of the 
blade width that is worn more rapidly. DE 43 03 315 A1 discloses a method and a device for 
cleaning endless and rotating surfaces in a paper 
machine. A web of material is brought into contact 
with the rotating surface and at least one doctor is 
used the blade of which acts in an area of the rotating 
surface which is not used by the web of material. 
In the doctor region wet air is applied to the rotating 
surface in the area not used by the web of 
material. Thus, in the present application, it is suggested that 
the lubrication pipe be divided into sections. It is a 
second alternative that different quantities of lubricating 
medium are introduced through separate pipe 
constructions of different portions of the doctor 
width. Thus, in the present application, it is 
suggested that a profiled lubrication jet be used, 
whereby the wear profile of the blade can be 
equalized. The method in accordance with the invention of 
lubricating a doctor is mainly characterized in that 
different quantities of lubricating medium are applied 
in different areas of the width of the roll, a larger 
amount of lubricating medium being applied in the area 
corresponding to the area of the width of the blade in 
which the maximum extent of wear of the blade has been 
noticed. The equipment in accordance with the invention is 
mainly characterized in that the means for applying  
 
lubricating medium
