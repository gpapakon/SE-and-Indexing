<ABSTRACT>
For spectrum spreading with a small spreading 
factor N which may be four, an input bit sequence of an 

input bit rate fs is eventually converted into a serial 
data sequence of serial data of which each serial datum 

consists of N repetitions of N consecutive bits of the 
input bit sequence. By a shift register (19) operable at 

fs and a memory (23) operable at fs/4, the input bit 
sequence is first converted into N parallel bit 

sequences, which are converted into the serial data 
sequence by a selector (27) operable at Nfs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spectrum spreading
which is preferable for use in a satellite communication
network including earth stations equipped with small
diameter antennas as in a VSAT satellite communication
network. More particularly, this invention relates to a
spectrum spreading method, a spectrum spreading device,
and a spectrum spreading transmitter in each of which use
is made of spectrum spreading of the type described.Spectrum spreading of this type is already known.
For example, "satellite communications system and
apparatus" are disclosed in United States Patent No.
4,455,651 issued to Paul Baran and assigned to Equatorial
Communications Company, California, the United States of
America. This satellite communication network of Baran
provides a low cost satellite communication network. For
this purpose, a small diameter antenna is used in each
earth station for transmission and reception of radio
signals. In order to trade off deterioration inevitably
caused by the small diameter antenna to communication
quality, a spectrum spreading technique is used on
producing a transmission signal. In the earth station of
the Baran satellite communication network, transmission 
data are spectrum spread at a spreading factor, namely, a
ratio of a chip rate to an input bit rate, of the order
of 256 and then subjected to BPSK modulation for
transmission as the transmission signal to a satellite
station.By the VSAT satellite communication network which
is used in practice in the United States of America and
elsewhere, in which the input bit rate is about 64 Kbps,
and in which the earth station is equipped with an
antenna of a diameter of 1 meter with a transmission
power of about 1 watt, it is possible without the
spectrum spreading technique to provide a communication
channel capable of insuring a sufficiently excellent
communication quality to satisfy the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) standards. With the antenna
diameter reduced to about 0.5 m, the VSAT satellite
communication network would satisfy the FCC standards if
the spectrum spreading technique is resorted to so as to
reduce a spectrum power density off an antenna axis. In
this event, a band spreading factor (hereafter referred
to simply as the spreading factor) of at most about five
(from four to eight) is sufficient in theory because the
antenna has a gain difference of 6 dB, namely, 20 log
(1/0.5) dB.Spectrum of a spectrum spread signal will now be
studied in connection with this small spreading factor.
It will be assumed that the
