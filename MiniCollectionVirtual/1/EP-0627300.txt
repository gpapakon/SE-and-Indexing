<ABSTRACT>
Process for welding along a desired seam line (10) two plastic sheets 
(4,5), through a paper sheet (7,8) superposed to a first of said plastic 

sheets (5), comprising: 

a) placing the two plastic sheets (4,5) with the superposed paper 
sheet (7,8) between anvil means in contact with the second plastic sheet 

(4) and ultrasonically powered horn means in contact with the paper 
sheet (7,8), said anvil means having a knurled surface and said horn 

means having a plain surface, 
b) subjecting the plastic (4,5) and paper (7,8) sheets to a pressure 
in the range of from 0.2 to 2.0 bar between the anvil means and the horn 

means, and 
c) activating the horn means by ultrasonics with a supply power of 
at least 1.2 Kw for a welding time in the range of from 80 to 300 

milliseconds to weld together the two plastic sheets (4,5) along said 
desired seam line (10), 
 
and shaped articles obtained therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for welding plastic sheets when a paper
sheet is superposed to said plastic sheets, and a shaped articles obtained with said
process.Processes and apparatus for welding plastic sheet materials are known in
the art. Usually, the plastic sheets are heat joined along a seam line by passing
together between an anvil and a sealing head and heating the plastic sheets by
ultrasound, conduction or frictional heating, as described in GB Patent Application
2,149,343. Usually, the ultrasonic welding process consists in the steps of
generating electrical energy, converting it in ultrasonic energy by a transducer and
emitting said ultrasonic energy by a horn; said energy allows the plastic sheets to
be sealed one to the other when they are pressed between a hard anvil and the
ultrasonic horn for a predetermined period of time.Ultrasonic welding process has been used to seal together transparent
plastic sheet materials to obtain, for example, an envelope for transparencies for
overhead projectors and like projecting apparatus, as those described in EP Patent
47,306.When paper sheets are superposed to the plastic sheet materials before
said sheets are sealed, the usual ultrasonic welding process binds the paper
sheets to the plastic sheets with bad results in terms of functionality. In fact, the
adhesion of the paper sheet to the plastic sheets must be as minimum as possible
in order not to produce marks or scratches.It is desirable to obtain a welding process that solves said problem of
adhesion of the paper sheets to the plastic sheets, still maintaining the good performance
of welding of the plastic sheets.An object of the present invention is to provide a process for welding
plastic sheets, when a paper sheet is superposed to one of said sheets, so that the 
plastic sheets are sealed by sealing means that operate through said paper sheet,
without creating adhesion of the paper sheet to the plastic sheets.Another object of the present invention is to provide shaped articles
comprising at least two plastic sheets sealed one to the other and at least a paper
sheet superposed to one of said sheets, wherein said shaped articles have been
obtained through a process for welding said plastic sheets through said paper
sheet.Still another object of the present invention is to provide an envelope, for
transparencies for overhead projectors, said envelope comprising a substantially
rectangular pocket of transparent plastic sheet material superposed by at least one
paper flap to

covered metal shoe is inserted between the paper sheet and the first plastic sheet.
A shaped article comprising two plastic sheets welded along a desired
seam line and a paper sheet superposed to a first of said plastic sheets, characterized in that

the two plastic sheets have been welded through the superposed paper sheet by a
process comprising: 


a) placing the two plastic sheets (4,5)with the superposed paper sheet
(7,8) between anvil means in contact with the second plastic sheet (4) and
