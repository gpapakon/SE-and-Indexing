<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stretch wrap film; that is, film 
for wrapping loads and which is stretched when wrapped around 
the load. Prior to stretch wrap film, loads were bundled by use of 
a variety of inefficient and/or expensive means, for example, 
ropes, metal bands and boxes. By using stretch wrap film, pallet 
loads of goods are effectively bundled so that they can 
withstand long distance transportation and protect the goods 
from the elements, while permiting visual identification of the 
wrapped goods. The merits of transparent stretch wrapping will 
ensure the continuing use of this type of bundling for many 
years to come. In the process of stretch wrap bundling; for example of a 
pallet load, the end of the film is anchored to the load and 
either the load is rotated or the roll of film is rotated about 
the load. During this process a slipping brake action is 
applied to the roll of film so that the film is applied to the 
load in a stretched condition. Several overlapping layers of 
the film are all that are needed to contain the load. Present 
day stretch wrap film has the ability to cling to itself and 
other surfaces by virtue of one or both of its surfaces 
exhibiting tack. As this bundling technique developed, sophisticated 
apparatus evolved to apply the stretch wrap film. In one of the 
systems it was found advantageous to employ a pre-stretch 
mechanism to the film at a point just before the film was 
applied to the load. This technique avoided, to a large extent, 
the use of the load to apply the stretch to the film. This also 
permitted better control of the longitudinal stretch and 
provided a means to minimize transverse dimensional decrease or 
neck-in. The end result included the fact that very little 
force was needed to wrap a load. This art is constantly looking for ways to improve the 
bundling of loads with stretch wrap film and it is an object of 
the present invention to improve the overall quality of stretch  
 
wrap film and the manner of employing such film. The present invention provides stretch wrap film stock 
which is pre-stretched, prior to winding in roll form, by an 
amount which leaves at least a functional amount of 
stretchability remaining in the pre-stretched film stock. The present invention also provides a process for the 
preparation of stretch wrap film, which process comprises :
 
   supplying stretch wrap film stock;
 
   pre-stretching the film stock by an amount which leaves at 
least a functional amount of stretchability remaining in the 
pre-s

<CLAIMS>
Stretch wrap film stock which is pre-stretched, prior to 
winding in roll form, by an amount which leaves at least a 

functional amount of stretchability remaining in the pre-stretched 
film stock. 
Stretch wrap film stock according to claim 1 wherein the 
pre-stretching is effected uniformly throughout the film stock. 
Stretch wrap film stock according to claim 1 or 2 wherein 
the pre-stretching is effected by uniaxial stretching. 
Stretch wrap film stock according to any preceding claim 
wherein the pre-stretching is effected in the machine direction. 
Stretch wrap film stock according to any preceding claim 
wherein the film stock is fully formulated prior to the pre-stretching. 
Stretch wrap film stock according to any preceding claim 
wherein the roll is wound onto a core the compressive strength 

of which is greater than the stress to which it is subjected by 
the pre-stretching. 
Stretch wrap film stock according to any preceding claim 
wherein the ends of the core are formed as lugs to facilitate 

manipulation.

process comprises :

 
   supplying stretch wrap film stock; 

   pre-stretching the film stock by an amount which leaves at 
least a functional amount of stretchability remaining in the 

pre-stretched film stock; and thereafter winding the film stock 
in roll form.
