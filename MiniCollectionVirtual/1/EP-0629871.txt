<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pole face design for
superconducting magnets of the type that are C-shaped. Such
structures of this type, generally, employ pole faces which
homogenize the magnet field within the imaging volume.The present superconducting magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) magnets require cryogens to operate, either liquid
helium or liquid helium and liquid nitrogen. Liquid helium is
used in superconducting magnets not only for cooling but also to
stabilize the magnet windings against motion induced
instabilities. Cryogens evaporate and are lost during magnet
operation and, therefore, require periodic cryogen delivery service
and cryogen addition, with the attendant cryogen safety hazards.
Furthermore, the use of cryogens complicate the cryostat
construction since the cryogen containment vessels must be built
in accordance with pressure vessel codes to withstand pressure
surges as a result of magnet quenches or loss of vacuum in the
vessel surrounding the cryogen containment vessel. The heavy
cryostat containment vessel requires complicated supports and
shields to position the cryostat containment vessel in the vacuum
vessel and yet minimize heat conduction and radiation to the
containment vessel from the ambient temperatures surrounding
the vacuum vessel.Helium leaks into the vacuum vessel surrounding
the cryostat containment vessel are a common cause of failure in 
most superconducting magnets. Helium gas leaking into the
vacuum vessel provides high heat conduction from the ambient
temperature surrounding the vacuum vessel to the cryogen
containment vessel containing the superconducting coils.Cryogen costs, specifically helium, are increasing
and there is a limited supply which is economically recoverable.
In many parts of the world helium is not available, therefore MRI
systems based on niobium titanium (NbTi) superconductors
cannot be operated. Therefore, a more advantageous
superconducting magnet, then, would be presented if such
amounts of the cryogen could be substantially reduced or
eliminated.Exemplary of such prior art magnets which do not
employ cryogens and which also allow patients to be imaged while
either standing up or lying down is commonly assigned U.S.
Patent 4,924,198 ('198) to E.T. Laskaris, entitled "Superconducting
Magnetic Resonance Magnet Without Cryogens". However, while
it is advantageous to be able to image patients while they are in a
variety of positions, the magnet must be constructed such that the
patients are capable of entering the magnet and being imaged
quick
