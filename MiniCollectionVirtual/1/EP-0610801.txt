<CLAIMS>
Hand-held surface-machining power tool (1)
which has a machine casing (2) containing a motor (3)

and which carries on a triangular toolholder (9), as a
rotary, orbital or oscillatory tool, a grinding plate

(8) having a triangular base to mount triangular
abrasive sheets and a dust extraction means,


characterized in that
 the toolholder (9) is arranged at
the front of the machine, 
in that
 the grinding plate
(8) is provided with a loop-and-burr fastener to mount

the abrasive sheets, 
in that
 the triangular base or
contour of the toolholder (9) substantially coincides

with the base of the grinding plate (8) and has a bowl-like
shape such that it is supported by its outer edge

(69) on the grinding plate (8), 
in that
 between the
grinding plate (8) and the bowl-like toolholder (9) a

gap is formed which, except for dust extraction
openings (47) and a mouth (19) of a dust discharge duct

(20), is substantially leakproof relative to the
exterior and serves for the passage of the dust drawn

off, while the dust outlet mouth (19) is arranged on

the toolholder (9) and the dust extraction openings
(47) are arranged in the grinding plate (8), and 
in
that
 the grinding plate (8) is detachably fastened to
the toolholder (9), over which it clips.
Hand-held power tool according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the toolholder (9) is coupled, in
particular detachably, by means of an eccentric pin 

(12), to the motor (3) on the side remote from the
grinding plate (8) and there carries, in particular

integrally, resilient oscillating elements (17, 18)
which fasten the toolholder (9) on the machine casing

(2) such as to secure it against corotation and against
detachment.
Hand-held power tool according to Claim 2,

characterized in that
 at least two oscillating elements
(17, 18) are arranged on the toolholder (9), one

oscillating element (18) being arranged on the front
corner (42) and another oscillating element (17),

particularly in the form of a pair of oscillating
elements, being arranged near that side edge (45) of

the toolholder (9) which lies opposite the corner (42).
Hand-held power tool according to Claims 1, 2
or 3, 
characterized in that
 the toolholder (9) is
provided with a single operating button (22) for

detaching the grinding plate (8) without an auxiliary
tool and on the side (45) opposite the operating button

(22) has at least one engagement opening (39, 40) in
which at least one support claw (48, 49, 50, 51, 52,

53) of the grinding plate (8) can engage.
Hand-held power tool according to Claim 4,

characterized in that
 the operating button (22) carries
a bolt (23) which is arranged for resilient

displacement on the toolholder (9), particularly
against the action of a compression spring (31), such

as to be secured against detachment, and which in its
resiliently held end position secures the grinding

plate (8).
Hand-held power tool according to Claim 5,

characterized in that
 the bolt (23) engages under a
catch hook (24) on the grinding plate (8), preferably

on the side of the latter which faces the toolholder
(9).
Hand-held power tool according to one of Claims
1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 in addition to at least
one catch hook (24) the grinding plate (8) carries

integrally a plurality of support claws (48, 49, 50, 
51, 52, 53) which are supported on the toolholder (9)

and thereby clampingly secure the grinding plate (8) in
position.
Hand-held power tool according to one of Claims
1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 in each case one catch
hook (24) and two support claws (48, 49, 50, 51, 52,

53) are arranged at each of the corners (54, 55, 56) of
the grinding plate.
Hand-held power tool according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the toolholder
(9) carries near the engagement opening (39, 40),

particularly on the side facing the grinding plate (8),
bosses (60, 61) which are clampingly supported against

the grinding plate (8), particularly against the
support claws (48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53) of the latter.
Hand-held power tool according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 on at least
part of its side remote from the toolholder (9) the

grinding plate (8) carries the loop-and-burr fastener.
Hand-held power tool according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the grinding
plate (8) carries dust extraction openings (47)

arranged on a common pitch circle.
Hand-held power tool according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the in
particular rectangular mouth (19) of the dust discharge

duct (20) is arranged, preferably centrally, on one
outer side of the toolholder (9).
Hand-held power tool according to Claim 12,

characterized in that
 the mouth (19) is extended by an
in particular rectangular bellows (21) to connect to

the machine casing (2).
Hand-held power tool according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the grinding
plate (8) can be replaced on the toolholder (9) by

other tools having the same fastening structure
corresponding to the toolholder (9), such as a scraper,

saw blade, parting blade or the like, without an
auxiliary tool. 
Hand-held power tool according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the grinding
plate (8) and/or the toolholder (9) rises or rise in

particular lie flush to form conjointly a truncated

pyramid.
