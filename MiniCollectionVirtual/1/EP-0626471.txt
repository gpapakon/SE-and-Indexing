<ABSTRACT>
A spinneret assembly comprising:
 

a spinneret plate with an upstream side and having a number of bores, 
each bore with one or more tapered sections; and

 
a sealing plate adjacent to the upstream side of said spinneret plate 

and forming an interface therewith, said sealing plate having 
cylindrical flow channels formed therein, with the proviso that said 

flow channels have at least two different diameters, each of said flow 
channels corresponds in position to a bore in said spinneret plate and 

said flow channels can be fewer in number than the number of bores in 
the spinneret plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to melt spinning filaments or fibers using a 
spinneret. More particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus for changing the number 
and size of filaments being spun from a single spinneret. Spinneret assemblies for spinning synthetic filaments or fibers typically include an 
inlet block having an inlet port through which the material to be spun is introduced into the 
spinneret assembly and a chamber containing filtering material, a distribution plate, a 
distribution cavity, a metering plate and a spinneret plate. The metering plate includes a 
number of apertures having a compound shape, consisting of a capillary and a counterbore. 
The spinneret plate normally includes a corresponding number of bores having a compound 
shape consisting of a counterbore and a capillary or spinning orifice. U.S. Patent No. 3,095,607 to Cobb describes a typical spinneret assembly. Other 
spinneret assemblies are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,028,627 to McCormick; U.S. Patent 
No. 2,883,261 to McGeorge; U.S. Patent No. 3,225,383 to Cobb; U.S. Patent No. 3,289,249  
 
to Nakayama et al.; U.S. Patent No. 3,601,846 to Hudnall; U.S. Patent No. 3,659,988 to 
Walczak; and U.S. Patent No. 4,738,607 to Nakajima et al. It is sometimes desirable to change the number of filaments or deniers of the 
filaments being spun from a single spinneret. Reasons for altering the filament count may 
include product variations, keeping the total tow denier constant while changing the 
individual filament denier, changing quenching characteristics and maintaining spinning 
speed at higher denier per filament where extruder capacity is limited. Also, mixed denier 
filaments produce unique product characteristics. The traditional method for changing filament count is to individually plug spinneret 
capillaries using a soft metal bar of approximately the same diameter as the counterbore. 
This method is time consuming, risks damage to the spinneret, and does not insure a leak-free 
seal. The traditional method of generating mixed deniers is to make expensive, precision 
metering plates for each mixture. Another known method for spinning a number of different filament counts from a 
single spinneret plate is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,336,633 to Curran. Curran employs 
metering plates having a number of apertures lower than the number of orifices in the 
spinneret plate. Since the compound shape of the apertures in the metering plate are 
normally precision drilled to provide a desired pressure drop, the
