<DESCRIPTION>
 PURIFICATION PROCESSThis invention is concerned with improvements in and relating to compositions for removing acidic contaminants from hydrocarbons and to processes for purifying hydrocarbons using such compositions.A wide variety of hydrocarbon materials, both liquid and gaseous, are treated to remove unwanted acidic contaminants. Thus, for example, olefins (such as ethylene and propylene) are purified (e.g. to remove hydrogen sulphide, carbonyl sulphide, carbon dioxide and/or sulphur dioxide) prior to catalysis to avoid poisoning or otherwise adversely affecting the catalyst employed; and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is treated to remove contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide and low molecular weight mercaptans. Other hydrocarbons which may be treated include gas condensates and halogenated hydrocarbons, which may be treated to remove traces of hydrogen chloride and phosgene.The bulk removal of acidic contaminants from hydrocarbons is commonly effected by washing the hydrocarbons with caustic solutions or amines. However, 

in order to obtain very low levels of contaminant (e.g. of the order of parts per billion) it is necessary to purify the hydrocarbon by passing it through a bed of an absorbent purifying material. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved material for use in such a purification process.According to one embodiment of the invention there is provided a solid absorbent material, for removing acidic contaminants from hydrocarbons, which absorbent material comprises sodium hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide (especially the former) ; alumina and/or zinc oxide (especially the former) ; and lime (calcium hydroxide) .The composition also preferably contains copper II oxide; especially when the composition is to be used in the treatment of dry (anhydrous) hydrocarbon materials.The composition of the invention suitably contains upto 10% by weight of sodium hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide; upto 40% by weight of aluminium oxide and/or zinc oxide; from 40 to 97% by weight of lime; and from upto 40% by weight of copper oxide (when present) . Preferred compositional ranges for the above components are set out in the following Table.
