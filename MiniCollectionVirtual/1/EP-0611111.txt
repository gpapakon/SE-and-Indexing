<ABSTRACT>
A headphone includes an electro-acoustic transducer, a 
housing, and first, second and third members. The electro-acoustic 

transducer includes a diaphragm and is supplied 
with a signal through a cord. The housing is shaped in such 

a way as to be accommodated into a concave portion of an 
auricle and includes an accommodating portion in which the 

electro-acoustic transducer is accommodated and a projecting 
portion for leading the cord from the inside of the housing 

to the outside of the housing. The accommodating portion 
has a first opening so that the electro-acoustic transducer 

is exposed to the outside from the first opening. The 
projecting portion is formed on the rear surface of the 

accommodating portion. A first member is provided 
so as to cover the whole surface of the diaphragm and the 

first opening and is made of a metal material. The first 
member has a plurality of first openings. A second member 

is provided on the first member so as to cover the first 
member and is made of a synthetic resin material. The 

second member has a plurality of second openings whose 
diameters are smaller than those of the first openings. A 

third member is attached to the housing so as to cover 
the housing having the second member attached at its portion 

in which the first opening is formed, and is made of an 
elastic material. The third member has a second opening 

which is smaller than the first opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to headphones. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a headphone
of an auricle insertion system (so-called inner ear-type
headphone) so that a housing thereof is inserted into an
auricle and secured therein when the headphone is in use.Headphones of so-called auricle insertion type have
hitherto been proposed as described in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,736,435, 4,429,194 and 4,646,872, for example. The
conventional headphone of this auricle insertion type is
arranged as shown in FIGURES 1 and 2. FIGURE 1 is an
exploded perspective view of such conventional headphone,
and FIGURE 2 is a perspective view showing the headphone
shown in FIGURE 1 in its assembled state. In FIGURES 1 and
2, reference numeral 1 designates a housing. The housing 1
incorporates therein a speaker unit 3 to which
signal lines 2a, 2b are connected. The speaker
unit 3 is inserted into an opening 
portion 1b of the housing 1 and accommodated within the housing 1
so as to expose its diaphragm 4 from the opening portion lb. The
speaker unit 3 has a small diameter, e.g., ten-odd millimeters
sufficient so that it can be inserted into an auricle and secured
therein. The diaphragm 4 provided in front of the speaker unit 3
is driven by a magnetic flux generated from a magnetic circuit 5
provided at the rear portion of the speaker unit 3. More
specifically, the diaphragm 4 is connected with a bobbin around
which there is wound a voice coil to which an audio signal is
supplied via the signal lines 2a, 2b. The bobbin and the diaphragm
4 are vibrated by a cooperation of a magnetic flux generated from
a magnet provided within the magnetic circuit 5 disposed near the
voice coil and an alternating magnetic flux generated by the voice
coil on the basis of the audio signal supplied to the voice coil.The two signal lines 2a, 2b are led out from a projecting
portion la formed at the rear portion of the housing 1 as a single
signal line 2. To the end portion of the signal line 2 is
connected a plug (not shown) that is inserted into a headphone jack
serving as an audio signal source. Although FIGURE 1 or 2 shows
only one headphone, a stereophonic-type headphone needs a pair of
right and left headphones, each of which has the housing 1 thus
arranged.With the above-mentioned structure, a reproduced sound is
radiated forwardly on the basis of the vibration of the diaphragm
4 of the speaker unit 3. A protector 6 having a number of
apertures 6a of relatively large diameters is disposed so as to 
wholly cover the front
