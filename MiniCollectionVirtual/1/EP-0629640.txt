<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention relates to a technique for 
synthesizing rubbery non-tapered, random, copolymers 

of 1,3-butadiene and isoprene. These rubbery 
copolymers exhibit an excellent combination of 

properties for utilization in tire sidewall rubber 
compounds for truck tires. By utilizing these 

isoprene-butadiene rubbers in tire sidewalls, tires 
having improved cut growth resistance can be built 

without sacrificing rolling resistance. Such rubbers 
can also be employed in tire tread compounds to 

improve tread wear characteristics and decrease 
rolling resistance without sacrificing traction 

characteristics. This invention more specifically 
discloses a process for the synthesis of isoprene-butadiene 

rubbers which comprises copolymerizing 
isoprene monomer and 1,3-butadiene monomer in an 

organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst system 
which is made by the sequential steps of (1) mixing 

(a) an organoaluminum hydride, (b) a member selected 
from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, 

cycloaliphatic alcohols, aliphatic thiols, 
cycloaliphatic thiols, trialkyl silanols, and triaryl 

silanols, and (c) optionally, 1,3-butadiene in an 
organic solvent to produce a modified organoaluminum 

catalyst component; (2) adding an organometallic 
compound which contains a metal from Group III-B of 

the Periodic System to the modified organoaluminum 
catalyst component to produce a Group III-B metal 

containing catalyst component; and (3) adding a 
compound which contains at least one labile halogen 

atom to the Group III-B metal containing catalyst 
component.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the copolymerization of 1,3-butadiene and 
isoprene with unmodified neodymium catalysts, the 1,3-butadiene 
polymerizes about 19 times faster than the 
isoprene. For this reason, such copolymers do not 
have a random distribution of monomers. One end of 
the polymer chains contain mostly repeat units which 
are derived from butadiene (which polymerised faster) 
and the other end of the polymer chains contain mostly 
repeat units which are derived from isoprene (which 
polymerized slower). As the polymerization proceeds, 
the availability of butadiene monomer for 
polymerization diminishes leaving more and more 
isoprene to polymerize subsequently. This causes such 
isoprene-butadiene rubbers to be tapered. United States Patent 4,663,405 discloses that 
conjugated diolefin monomers can be polymerised with a 
catalyst system which is comprised of (1) an 
organoaluminum compound, (2) an organometallic 
compound which contains a metal from Group III-B of 
the Periodic System, such as lanthanides and 
actinides, and (3) at least one compound which 
contains at least one labile halogen atom. United 
States Patent 4,663,405 also discloses that the 
molecular weight of the polymers made with such 
catalyst systems can be reduced by conducting the 
polymerization in the presence of a vinyl halide. 
However, its teachings do not specifically disclose 
copolymerizations of isoprene with butadiene and do 
not provide any technique for making the isoprene 
monomer polymerize at a rate which is similar to that 
of the butadiene monomer. Thus, its teachings do not 
provide a technique for synthesizing random, non-tapered 
isoprene-butadiene rubbers with catalyst  
 
systems which are comprised of (1) an organoaluminum 
compound, (2) an organometallic compound which 
contains a metal from Group III-B of the Periodic 
System, such as lanthanides and actinides, and (3) at 
least one compound which contains at least one labile 
halogen atom. It has been unexpectedly found that rubbery 
copolymers of butadiene and isoprene which are random 
and non-tapered can be synthesized with the catalyst 
systems of this invention. These rubbery copolymers 
exhibit an excellent combination of properties for 
utilization in tire sidewall rubber compounds for 
truck tires. By utilizing these isoprene-butadiene 
rubbers in tire sidewalls, tires having improved cut 
growth resistance can be built without sacrificing 
rolling resistance. The isoprene-butadiene rubbers 
made by the process of this invention can also be 
employed in tire
