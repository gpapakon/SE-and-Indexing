<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel cyclic phosphorous acid esters of the formula (I) 
<
IMAGE
>
  in which   R
<
1
>
 and R
<
2
>
 are alkyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals and R
<
1
>
 is furthermore a hydrogen radical, and   Y is a single bond, -S- or -HCR
<
3
>
-, in which   R
<
3
>
 is a hydrogen radical or alkyl radical, to a process for their preparation, and to the use of phosphorous acid esters in organic isocyanates as the stabiliser, organic isocyanates stabilised against discolouration which contain phosphorous acid esters, and a process for the preparation of the stabilised organic isocyanates by mixing the isocyanates with the phosphorous esters and, if appropriate, phenolic compounds, if appropriate, at elevated temperatures.
