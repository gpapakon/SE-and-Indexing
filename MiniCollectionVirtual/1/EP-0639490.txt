<ABSTRACT>
A combined push chair and car seat comprises a 
seat support frame (11) to which are attached four legs 

(31,32,33,34) carrying wheels (21,22,23,24). The legs are 
rotatable with respect to the frame from a retracted 

configuration to an extended configuration. Spring means 
(50,51) whose operation is initiated by an actuating lever 

(40), operate to move the legs from the retracted position 
to the extended position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combined 
pushchair and car seat for small children. For several years now it has been compulsory in 
some countries to transport children who are too small for 
adult seat belts in special seats which can be firmly 
strapped down. Once a journey is completed, the children 
are often transferred to pushchairs, otherwise known as 
buggies. This involves two major drawbacks. Firstly the 
buggy takes up valuable space in the vehicle luggage 
compartment. Secondly, the transfer process often wakes the 
child causing distress. Thus, various combined buggies and 
car seats have been proposed hitherto. Currently available 
versions require the seat to be detached from the buggy 
frame for use inside a vehicle, so that the frame still 
needs to be stored elsewhere. There have also been various 
proposals for folding the buggy components into the shell of 
the car seat but these have all had certain drawbacks and 
seem not to have reached the market place. For example, 
there are versions involving telescoping legs which are 
mechanically complicated and difficult to manufacture, and 
also cumbersome to convert from buggy mode to car seat mode 
and vice versa. Some versions involve several manual 
operations by the user to convert from one mode to the 
other.  Some of the simplest of the known proposals 
include four legs carrying wheels which are rotatable with 
respect to a seat support frame. Examples are shown in 
WO-A-8802714, US-A-4989888 and US-A-4834403. A problem with 
these known arrangements seems to be that they need to be 
held above the ground whilst the legs are extended. Thus, 
there is still a need for a combined car seat and buggy 
which is simple and inexpensive to manufacture and easy to 
convert from one mode to another. The present invention provides a foldable 
pushchair comprising a seat support frame to which are 
attached four legs carrying wheels, the legs being rotatable 
with respect to the frame from an extended position to a 
retracted position in which the wheels are positioned either 
side of the seat support frame, characterised by spring 
means operable to move the legs from the retracted position 
to the extended position. Thus, the wheels can be readily 
retracted through simple rotational movement and, being 
located at the side of the seat, the seat can readily be 
used to transport its occupant, in a car or any other 
vehicle since the wheels are no longer in the way. Preferably separate spring means are provided for 
the front and rear

<CLAIMS>
A foldable pushchair comprising a seat support 
frame (11) to which are attached four legs (31,32,33,34) 

carrying wheels (21,22,23,24), the legs being rotatable with 
respect to the frame from an extended position to a 

retracted position in which the wheels are positioned either 
side of the seat support frame, characterised by spring 

means (50,51) operable to move the legs from the retracted 
position to the extended position. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in claim 1 in 
which the legs (31,32,33,34) pivot rearwardly and upwardly 

with respect to the frame (11) in moving from the extended 
position to the retracted position. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
including separate spring means for the front (31,34) and 

rear (32,33) legs. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in claim 3 in 
which the spring means (51) for the rear legs at least 

additionally act to retain the legs in the retracted 
position. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in claim 4 in 
which the spring means for the rear legs are positioned to 

direct a force above or below the pivot axis of the rear 
legs depending on the rotational position of the legs. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in any preceding 
claim in which the spring means (50,51) direct a linear 

force on the legs (31,32,33,34). 
A foldable push chair as claimed in any preceding 
claim in which the spring means (50,51) are heavily 

damped. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in any preceding 
claim in which the spring means (50,51) are sufficiently 

strong to cause the push chair to lift the weight of the 
seat carrying a small child in moving from the retracted to 

the extended configuration. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in any preceding 
claim in which the spring means (50,51) comprise gas 

struts. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in any preceding 
claim in which the front legs (31,34) rotate together about 

a common axis and the rear legs (32,33) rotate together 
about a common axis. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in any preceding 
claim including actuator means (40) operable to push the 

legs from the retracted position towards the extended 
position. 
A foldable push chair as claimed in claim 11 in 
which the actuator means comprise a lever (40) which is 

pivotable with respect to the frame.
