<ABSTRACT>
In a fluorescent lighting controller, a switching circuit operates to selectively couple a bank of electronic ballasts (36) to an AC power source (34). The switching circuit comprises a pair of relays (RL3, RL4), preferably connected in parallel, with one of such relays having a controllably conductive device (Q1), such as an electronic switch, and preferably a triac, connected in series therewith. With the relays open, an air gap isolates the power source and ballasts. In closing the relays in sequence, one relay (RL3) provides a conductive path from the power source to the triac. After a suitable delay to allow the relay contacts to stabilize in the closed position, the triac is triggered to provide a conductive path from the power source to the ballasts, and a large current surge (as much as 300 amps) flows to the ballasts. After the current surge has subsided, the other relay (RL4) is closed to provide a direct conductive path between the power source and ballasts. As a result of this arrangement, the switching circuit is low cost, compact and reliable over an extended period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in current-switching 
circuits of the type used, for example, in fluorescent lighting control 
systems for selectively connecting a bank of electronic ballasts to an AC 
power source. In applying power to an electronic ballast of the type used to control 
the operation of a fluorescent lamp, one finds that the ballast behaves as 
a capacitive load. Thus, each time power is applied to the load, for 
example, by closing a switch between the load and a line voltage source, 
there is an in-rush of current to the load which quickly subsides as the 
load charges up to line voltage. This temporary current surge can be 
problematic as the number of electronic ballasts controlled by a single 
relay switch increases. For example, in the case of a full 16 ampere 
(steady-state) circuit of dimming ballasts, the current surge can approach 
300 amps. Though short-lived, perhaps only a few cycles, this level of 
surge can wreak havoc on the contacts of even a relatively large relay 
having a high (e.g. 50 amp) current rating. The problem stems from the 
fact that each time a pair of relay contacts close or snap together, there 
is a tendency for them to bounce apart. When this bouncing occurs 
during a large current surge, the intervening gas or air ionizes and arcing 
occurs. The arcing has the effect of blasting away the conductive 
coatings on the relay contacts which eventually causes the relay to fail,  
 
either due to erosion of the contact material, or, more commonly, due to 
welding of the contacts in the closed position. To deal with the above problem, one might consider the brute force 
approach of using a single heavy-duty relay having large contacts and a 
high spring constant. But relays of this type tend to be both costly and 
bulky in size. A more elegant and far less costly approach is to use two 
relatively small relays connected in parallel, with one having a current-limiting 
resistive element in series therewith. Such a switching circuit is 
shown in FIG. 1. In operation, relay RL1 is closed for a short time while 
relay RL2 remains open . As relay RL1 closes, current from the power 
source rushes through the resistor R to charge up the capacitive load. 
The amplitude of the current surge is limited by the resistor, depending on 
its value. After the current surge has abated, the second relay is closed 
to provide a direct and substantially impedance-free path between the 
source and load. Obviously, the resistor in this circuit must be 
appropriately
