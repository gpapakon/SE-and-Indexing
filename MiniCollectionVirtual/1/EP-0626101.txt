<ABSTRACT>
A wire connector having a conductive barrel with a solder mass disposed in the barrel is formed with wire retaining means to hold the wires in place during heating and melting of the solder to form a permanent connection. A shrinkable sleeve formed around the barrel and extending beyond the ends of the barrel is also shrunk down onto the wires to insulate the connection and hold the wires.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wire connectors and in 
one aspect to a wire connector for making low profile butt 
splices between two conductors wherein the conductors are 
connected end to end. The prior art is replete with connecting devices 
for joining two or more wires in electrical contact to 
splice the same into a given circuit. The devices that are 
considered relevant to the background of this invention are 
not the insulation displacement connectors or the wire nut 
twist-on connectors but connectors where the wires are 
placed in end-to-end relationship for making a butt splice 
and maintained in electrical connection by a crimp 
connector, a weld or similar connection. Often the 
electrical connections will be insulated using heat-shrinkable 
tubular components. There are many examples of 
electrical connection devices which include heat-shrinkable 
components. Often the heat-shrinkable portion will be in 
the form of a tube or sleeve. The inner wall of the tube 
may be coated with an adhesive or sealant. When, 
positioned within the shrinkable tube, the means for 
joining conductors is found usually close to the central 
portion of the heat-shrink sleeve. The joining means is 
frequently a ring or band of solder as described, for 
example, in GB-A-1,149,125; US-A-4,940,179 and WO-A-9,007,207. 
(Other related patents are: US-A-4,722,471; US-A-4,300,284; GB-A-2,020,922; 
US-A-4,832,248; WO-A-8,809,068; US-A-4,505,421 and US-A-4,883,924). 
The use of bands or rings of solder are 
referred to as solder inserts or preforms. Such inserts 
perform the conventional function of soldering electrical 
conductors to provide an electrical connection. In some 
cases, the solder may be rendered susceptible to and melted 
using, high frequency alternating currents as described in 
US-A-4,987,283 and US-A-4,852,252. While the solder inserts  
 
have a well defined shape, in some cases they may be 
replaced by an undefined quantity of solder as disclosed in 
US-A-4,654,473 and US-A-4,384,404. As an alternative, the solder components may be 
replaced by crimp barrels within the heat-shrink sleeves. 
Connectors which rely upon crimp barrels are described, for 
example, in US-RE-33591 and US-A-4,993,149. Another means of making electrical connection 
between conductors is revealed in US-A-5,006,286. In this 
case the solder is replaced by a conductive gel medium. The 
gel, located centrally within a heat shrink sleeve, 
provides a conductive path between conductors which are 
inserted into and surrounded by, the

<CLAIMS>
A wire connector for making an electrical 
connection between a plurality of wires and forming an 

insulated connection, the connector comprises a hollow 
tubular member (10) formed to receive wire ends and a shrinkable 

sleeve (14) positioned about the tubular member with the inner 
diameter of the shrinkable sleeve fitted to the outside 

surface of the tubular member to provide an insulative 
cover for the conductive member characterized by the 

feature that the tubular member (10) is formed of an 
electrically conductive metal having self actuated wire 

retaining means (20), formed from the material of the 
tubular member (10) and positioned adjacent the ends of the 

tubular member and extending into the tubular member for 
affording wire retention for wires inserted into the 

tubular member, and that a mass of solder (12) is 
positioned within the tubular member generally centrally 

thereof between its ends and the wire retaining means (20) 
to flow around the wire ends and electrically connect the 

same upon shrinking said shrinkable sleeve (14). 
A connector according to claim 1 
characterized in that said wire retaining means (20) 

comprises tab means (20) formed from the tubular member and 
bent into the tubular member, said tab means having a 

length sufficient to extend past the longitudinal axis of 
the tubular member and formed to engage a bare wire 

inserted into the tubular member from either end and resist 
the retraction of the wire. 
A connector according to claim 1 
characterized in that said mass of solder (12) is of a size 

to fit in the tubular member through an interruption (18) 
formed in the tubular member to form the tab means. 
A connector according to claim 1 
characterized in that said tubular member (10) is 

cylindrical in shape and the shrinkable sleeve (14) is heat  
 

shrinkable and the central portion thereof is shrunk onto 
said tubular member and the ends are bell shaped beyond the 

ends of the tubular member. 
A connector as defined in claim 1 
characterized in that the shrinkable sleeve (14) is heat 

shrinkable and the sleeve has a coating (16) of adhesive 
disposed on the inner surface of the shrinkable sleeve. 
A connector according to claim 5

adhesive. 
A connector as defined in claim 1 
characterized in that the shrinkable sleeve (40) is heat 

shrinkable and a pair of hollow tubular sleeves (41,42) of 
a thermoplastic are inserted into the sleeve (40), one 

tubular sleeve at each end of the sleeve (40) and against 
either end of the
 tubular member (10) for sealing the ends

comprising the steps of
 
   cutting into a sheet of electrically conductive 

material, having two opposite sides and two ends, to make 
a pair of generally U-shaped cuts with the open ends of the 

U positioned oppositely of each other and opening toward 
the ends of the sheet,
 
   forming the sheet into a hollow cylinder,
 
   joining the opposite sides to form a seam to hold 

the sheet in the cylindrical shape,
  
 

   depressing the section of material within each of 
the pair of U-shaped cuts into the cylinder to form tabs 

directed toward each other within the cylinder,
 
   placing a mass of solder into the cylinder

The method of claim 11 characterized in that 
the method includes the step of shrinking the central 

portion of the shrinkable sleeve onto the cylinder to
