 TITLEFIBRONECTIN-CONTAINING OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION, METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF AN OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION, METHOD OF PRESERVING AN OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION, AND METHODS OF TREATMENT OF OPHTHALMIC WOUNDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a stable and soluble multi-dose ophthalmic solution containing fibronectin, an amino acid, a sugar, and a lower alkyl p-hydroxybenzoate preservative and to a method of treatment of ophthalmic wounds employing the ophthalmic solution. This invention further relates to a process for preparing fibronectin for ophthalmic use. This invention further relates to a method for inhibiting bacterial growth in an ophthalmic solution while preserving the cellular adhesion and wound healing properties of fibronectin.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fibronectin is useful in therapeutic treatment because of the role that it plays in cellular adhesion, blood coagulation, malignant transformation, reticuloendothelial system function, and embryonic differentiation. Fibronectin's role in cellular adhesion and in promoting epithelial cell outgrowth makes it desirable for treatment of ophthalmic wounds, particularly corneal disorders. Other growth factors have also been identified as being useful as healing accelerators for treatment of ophthalmic wounds. For example, recombinant human epithelial growth factor has been shown to accelerate corneal re-epithelialization following abrasive injury or alkali burn injury (Stern et al., "The Effects of Human Recombinant Epidermal Growth Factor on Epihelial Wound Healing", in Healing Processes in the Cornea, 69-75 (C.E. Crosson and H.E. Kaufman, eds.) (1989). Similarly, fibroblast growth factor has also been 

 reported to stimulate corneal healing (Countois, Y. et al. , 181 c. R. Soc. Biol.. 491 (1987)). Numerous other growth promoting substances have also been identified (e.g., interleukin 6, platelet-derived growth factor, etc.) and may be useful in accelerating ophthalmic wound healing. Ophthalmic wounds can be caused in many ways, for example, by puncture, physical trauma, acid splash, surgical incisions, chemical burns, or lacerations. It is believed that fibronectin promotes the migration of epithelial cells over the wound surface and promotes binding of the epithelial cells to the wound surface to provide a permanent closure of the wound. This process may stimulate the production of endogenous growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factors.To treat an ophthalmic wound with fibronectin, the fibronectin should be applied by means of an ophthalmic
