<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a thickened aqueous sulphamic acid composition, characterised in that it contains, as thickening agent, a heteropolysaccharide of succinoglycan type, the said thickening agent being stabilised therein by an effective amount of potassium sulphamate. It also relates to the uses of the said composition for cleaning surfaces.

<CLAIMS>
Thickened aqueous sulphamic acid composition, 
characterized in that it contains a hydrocolloid of 

succinoglycan type as thickening agent, the said thickening 
agent being stabilized therein by an effective 

amount of potassium sulphamate. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the heteropolysaccharide of succinoglycan type is 

obtained from the fermentation of a carbohydrate by a 
strain of microorganisms belonging to the genus Agrobacterium 

and more particularly to the species Agrobacterium 

radiobacter, Agrobacterium rhizogenes and 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 
Composition according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that it is a succinoglycan obtained by 

fermentation of a carbohydrate using an Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens I 736 culture, one of its mutants or one of 

its recombinants. 
Composition according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that its pH is between 0.5 and 

1.5. 
Composition according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the amount of heteropolysaccharide 

of succinoglycan type is between 0.01 and 
0.8 % by weight relative to the total weight of the 

composition. 
Composition according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, for a pH between 0.5 and 

1.5 and a viscosity of the order of 100 to 6000 mPa.s it 
comprises by weight approximately 5 to 10 % of sulphamic 

acid, 0.1 to 0.6 % by weight of heteropolysaccharide of  
 

succinoglycan type and between 0.1 and 6 % by weight of 
potassium sulphamate. 
Use of a composition according to one of the 
preceding claims for the treatment of surfaces covered 

with inorganic and/or organic deposits.
