<ABSTRACT>
A brush member for an electric toothbrush with a handle member has an electric driving motor. The brush member can be linked to the handle member. A substantially circular cylindrical bristle-carrier (38) is rotatively mounted at the end of the brush member opposite to the handle member and carries bristles (48, 50) arranged into bristle tufts (60, 62) of different lengths. The bristle-carrier (38) has an axis of rotation approximately perpendicular to a longitudinal center line of the brush member and capable of rotating back and forth in an angular range from +/-20 DEG  and +/-100 DEG . Some bristle tufts (60) are arranged behind each other on a diameter of an outer circle of the bristle-carrier (38).

A brush section (24) for an electric toothbrush
(20) with a handle section (22) comprising an electric

motor drive mechanism (28), wherein the brush section
(24) is adapted to be connected with the handle section

(22) and has at its end remote from the handle section
(22) an in particular essentially circular cylindrical

rotary bristle supporting structure (38) on the end
surface of which bristles (48, 50) are arranged in the

form of tufts (60, 62, 64, 66), and wherein the bristle
supporting structure (38) has its axis of rotation (54)

at approximately right angles to a longitudinal center
line (52) of the brush section (24) and is adapted to be

driven in an alternating rotary motion, preferably over
an arc of ± 20° to ± 100°, and the tufts (60, 62, 66) of

bristles are serially located in position on a diameter
(68) and on an outer circular ring (70) of the bristle

supporting structure (38), 
characterized in that
 in a
central or normal position of the bristle supporting

structure (38) the diameter (68) is arranged at
approximately right angles t
o the longitudinal center
line (52) of the brush section (24), and that the bristle

tufts (60) on the diameter (68) are of greater rigidity
than the bristle tufts (64) in an inner field (80)

between the diameter (68) and the outer circular ring
(79), the increase in rigidity being obtainable by

providing the bristles with a greater diameter or using a
greater number of bristles per tuft (60, 62, 66). 
The brush section as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that
 bristle tufts (64) of the inner
field (80) are arranged on an inner circular ring (72) of

the bristle supporting structure (38).
The brush section as claimed in claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the tufts (64) in the inner field
(80) comprise bristles of a diameter smaller than the

diameter of the bristles of the tufts (60, 62, 66) on the
outer circular ring and/or on the diameter.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the tufts (64) in
the inner field (80) comprise bristles of a length

shorter than the length of the bristles of the tufts (60,
62, 66) on the outer circular ring and/or on the

diameter.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the number of
bristles of the tufts (64) in the inner field (80) is

smaller than the number of bristles of the tufts (60, 62,
66) on the outer circular ring and/or on the diameter.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the bristles of
the tufts (62, 66) arranged on the outer circular ring

(70) differ in length, thickness, diameter or number per
tuft (60, 62, 66) from the bristles of the tufts (60)

arranged on the diameter (68). 
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 a single tuft
(82) of bristles is arranged approximately centrally in

the inner field (80) of the bristle supporting structure.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
claims 1 to 5 or 7, 
characterized in that
 the bristles of
the tufts (60, 62, 66) on the outer circular ring and/or

on the diameter are of equal length.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the bristles (50) of
the tufts (60) arranged on the diameter (68) are of a

length greater than the bristles (48) of the other tufts
(62, 64).
The brush section as claimed in claim 9,

characterized in that
 the tufts (62, 64) having the
shorter bristles (48) are arranged on the bristle

supporting structure (38) on two approximately concentric
circular rings (70, 72).
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the longer
bristles (50) protrude beyond the shorter bristles (48)

by 1.5 mm, approximately.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the shorter
bristles (48) have a diameter of 5 to 6 mils, and the

longer bristles (50) have a diameter of 6 to 7 mils. 
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the tufts (60,
66) comprising the longer bristles (50) are color-coded.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in tha
t the angle of rotation
of the bristle supporting structure (38) is preferably

about ± 20° to ± 100°, in particular about ± 35°,
related to the central or normal position of the bristle

supporting structure (38).
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the outer circular
ring (70) is equipped with 12 bristle tufts (62, 66),

approximately, the bristles having a length of between 8
and 9 mm, approximately, and a diameter of 6 mils,

approximately.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 six bristle tufts
(60), approximately, are arranged on the diameter (68),

approximately, and a diameter of 6 mils, approximately.
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the inner field
(80) is equipped with two to six bristle tufts, approximately,

mm, approximately, and a diameter of between 5 and 6

mils, approximately. 
The brush section as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the bristles of
