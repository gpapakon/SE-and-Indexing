<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatically actuated hydraulic multimetering device of the type of those formed by a cylinder, the actuation of which in turn gives rise to the actuation of a series of working cylinders, and is characterised by the fact that the piston (2) of the pneumatic cylinder (1) is equipped with rods (3) which are non-detachable therefrom and remain in relation with the respective sleeves connected to a cover of the pneumatic cylinder (1) in order to form the metering cylinders, so that each of the sleeves (4) remains connected via a pipe (7) to the sleeve (5) of the corresponding working cylinder (8), knowing that the displacement en masse of the pistons (9) of the working cylinders (8) is given a uniform movement independently of the loads which are they withstanding.

Pneumatically-actuated multiple hydraulic dispenser 
device, comprising a pneumatic cylinder (1) with a large 

cross-section, the action of which, by means of a hydraulic 
system, drives a series of working cylinders (8) with 

pistons (9), and which is characterized in that the piston 
of the pneumatic cylinder is fitted with rods (3) which 

cannot be separated from it, and that each of these 
respectively cooperate with the sleeves (4) joined to the 

pneumatic cylinder cover, thus forming the dispenser 
cylinders, each of the aforementioned sleeves (4) being 

joined, by means of a hydraulic conduit, to the sleeve (5) 
of the corresponding working cylinder (8), the movement of 

the pistons (9) of the working cylinders being carried out 
all at one time with a uniform movement independent of the 

work load which they bear, with the dispenser and working 
cylinders being of either simple or double action.
