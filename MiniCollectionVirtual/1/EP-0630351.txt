<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is broadly concerned with an 
improved candle for generating breathable oxygen by 
initiation and decomposition of an alkaline metal chlorate 
or perchlorate source. During decomposition of the 
chlorate or perchlorate, toxic free chlorine gas may be 
evolved. Furthermore, irregular decomposition of the 
alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate will result in uneven 
evolution of oxygen. Thus, this invention specifically relates to an 
oxygen generating alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate 
candle composition having a non-toxic additive compound 
incorporated therein which regulates and smooths oxygen 
decomposition and suppresses formation of toxic free 
chlorine gas. Chemical oxygen generating candles containing 
alkali metal chlorates or perchlorates have long been used 
as an emergency supply of breathable oxygen where weight 
and space limitations are important factors. Exemplary in 
this respect are aircraft which fly at high altitudes, 
submarines, and other closed atmospheric enclosures which 
house personnel or passengers. Many previous oxygen candles which employed an 
alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate compound as the 
oxygen source have utilized barium peroxide (BaO2) as an 
additive to smooth out the decomposition rate of the 
chlorate or perchlorate and to suppress formation of free 
chlorine which is a toxic gas. A metal oxide catalyst has 
also commonly been used to facilitate decomposition of the 
oxygen source, and a powdered metal fuel such as iron  
 
powder incorporated to furnish extra heat to help sustain 
the reaction process. A small portion of glass powder 
and/or glass fibers have also been employed as a binder. 
Although BaO2 performs the function of suppressing free 
chlorine formation and smoothing oxygen evolution during 
decomposition of alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate 
oxygen sources, it is in and of itself a poisonous 
compound. Unless extraordinary precautions are taken, 
tiny BaO2 particles may be released along with the oxygen 
generated, presenting an immediate health hazard to the 
person breathing the oxygen being generated and possibly 
contaminating the surrounding atmosphere as well. Equally 
as importantly, environmental regulations require the use 
of costly procedures and equipment to dispose of scraps 
and expended oxygen candles containing BaO2 and/or its 
reaction products, such as BaCl2. Several alkali metal oxides such as Na2O, Na2O2 
and KO2 have also been suggested as catalysts for NaClO3 
decomposition and to suppress acidic
