<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid analogues of the kind described in PCT/EP92/01220 (PNA's) which hybridise strongly to nucleic acids are used to inhibit nucleic acid amplification procedures such as PCR. False positives in subsequent PCR assays are prevented by hybridising a PNA to PCR amplification products. Assays capable of discriminating between single base pair mutants are conducted by using a PNA hybridising to one of the two allelic forms to inhibit a PCR amplification of that form selectively. Asymmetric PCR amplifications are carried out by starting a PCR symmetricaly using like quantities of forward and reverse primers and once the amplification is established disabling one primer by hybridising a PNA thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of nucleic acid 
analogues in blocking nucleic acid amplification procedures 
and to diagnostic/analytical techniques based thereon. Nucleic acid amplification techniques are now in 
widespread use. These include the "PCR" (polymerase chain 
reaction) procedures described in EP-A-0200362 and EP-A-0201184 
which is the technique in most widespread use, but 
also the "LCR" (ligase chain reaction) described in EP-A-0320308 
and the so-called "NASBA" or "3SR" technique which is 
described in "Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA" Vol 87. pp 1874-1878 
March 1990 and "Nature" Vol 350, No 6313. pp 91-92 7th March 
1991. A major problem in the use of these procedures in 
diagnostics is the production of false positives by the carry 
over of amplified nucleic acid sequences from previous 
reactions. As these procedures are capable of producing a 
positive result if even a single molecule containing the 
target sequence is present, it is of course very easy for such 
a false positive to occur. At present it is necessary for the 
reaction product of such procedures to be worked up before the 
success or failure of the amplification procedure can be 
determined. The involves contact between the reaction product 
and several pieces of laboratory equipment such as pipettes, 
as well as with personnel which can lead to traces of the 
amplification product being available to contaminate future 
runs. Much effort is currently going into developing so called 
"intrinsic" procedures in which the success of the 
amplification reaction can be monitored without any handling 
of the amplification product and in an unopened reaction 
vessel. New forms of nucleic acid analogue are described in EP-A-586 618 
(Patent Co-operation Treaty application. No. PCT/EP92/01220 
filed on 22nd May 1992) which selectively bind conventional  
 
nucleic acids of complementary sequence to form hybrids which 
are more stable against dehybridisation by heat than are 
similar hybrids between conventional nucleic acids. We have 
now found that it is possible to exploit this greater hybrid 
stability to block selectively nucleic acid amplification 
procedures. This technique may be used to prevent false 
positives in such amplification procedures. It may also be 
exploited as an essential part of certain diagnostics/analytical 
approaches. WO 92/07957 describes a method for preventing further amplification of nucleic acids, 
wherein hybridized nucleic acids are covalently bound together by a photoreactive 
compound.
