<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus comprises a 
communicating circuit, a connecting unit for connecting 

a telephone or the communicating circuit to a line, a 
disconnecting unit for disconnecting the telephone from 

the line, a call reception detection circuit, a 
detection circuit for detecting a hook state of the 

telephone, an output unit for outputting a signal 
indicating that the call generation limitation mode has 

been set, a display for displaying that the apparatus 
is in the call generation limitation mode, and a dial 

signal transmission unit. A call generation of an 
attached telephone can be limited with a simple 

construction and a call generation limiting function of 
the data communication apparatus can be certainly

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
apparatus and method having a call generation limiting function
and an attached telephone.Among facsimile apparatuses, there is a
facsimile apparatus having a call generation limiting
function to limit a call generation for a facsimile
transmission or the like.According to the call generation limiting
function, for example, a key code for a specific call
generation limitation is set and the user inputs the
key code from an operation panel of a facsimile
apparatus, thereby setting the facsimile apparatus into
a call generation limitation state.The conventional call generation limiting
function as mentioned above, however, limits only a
call generation from the facsimile apparatus main body,
so that a call can be generated from an attached
telephone and a handset. Document GB-A-2 253 969 discloses a sending control
method of a facsimile device comprising a telephone. This
method controls the sending by having a corresponding secret
number inputted through a key pad in case that any person
wants to send a document to an external facsimile or wants to
call through the telephone attached to the facsimile device.Document US-A-4 893 335 discloses a telephone control
system that connects to the telephone line from a telephone
exchange and provides a variety of controllable functions.
One of them is to prevent local stations from gaining access
to telephone lines for specific telephone numbers. This is
achieved on the basis of a connection means used for connecting
the whole communication apparatus to the telephone line.Document JP 61 118 068 A discloses a telephone call prohibiting
system in facsimile communication network that can
obtain a telephone call request reception impossible condition
by masking a telephone call switch.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
communication apparatus which can limit a call generation of
an attached telephone. The above and other objects and features of the
present invention will become more apparent from the
following detailed description and appended claims with
reference to the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a schematic constructional diagram of
the first embodiment of the invention;Fig. 2 is comprised of Figs. 2A to 2C are
flowcharts showing the operation of the first
embodiment;Fig. 3 is comprised of Figs. 3A to 3C are
flowcharts showing the operation of the second
embodiment of the invention;Fig. 4 is a schematic constructional diagram of
the third embodiment of the invention;Fig. 5 is a flowchart
