<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for
effecting the asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefinic
compounds. In particular, methods are disclosed for
the production of optically active glycols and
α-hydroxyketones which utilize catalytically active
amounts of an osmium tetroxide-chiral ligand complex
that is capable of mediating the asymmetric
dihydroxylation of olefinic substrates. In the
methods of the present invention, osmium tetroxide is
produced electrolytically from an osmium-containing
precursor or regenerated electrolytically from lower
oxidation state osmium species formed during the
dihydroxylation reaction. Furthermore, by the methods
of the present invention, osmium tetroxide is produced
by chemical oxidation from an osmium-containing
precursor or from a lower oxidation state osmium
species using a secondary oxidant that, itself, is
produced or regenerated electrolytically during the
dihydroxylation reaction.The asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins with
osmium tetroxide to yield optically active glycols has
been described extensively in the literature
(Sharpless, K. B., et al. J. Org. Chem.1991, 56, 4585
and references cited therein). In a dihydroxylation
reaction, an olefinic substrate is transformed into a
dihydroxyl-substituted compound (i.e., a glycol)
through the addition of two hydroxyl groups across the
double bond. During an asymmetric dihydroxylation
reaction, the hydroxyl groups are added
stereoselectively across a particular face of the 
prochiral olefin double bond. This stereofacial
selectivity is made possible by chiral mediators, in
particular, a chiral tertiary amine ligand that forms
a complex with osmium tetroxide (Hentges, S. G., et
al. J. Am. Chem. Soc.1980, 102, 4263; and Jacobsen,
E. N., et al. Ibid. 1988, 110, 1968).The optically active glycols produced by this
asymmetric reaction are important chiral starting
materials for organic synthesis. For instance, these
glycols can be used advantageously as precursors of
more complex molecules. In particular,
pharmacologically active compounds, such as the
anticancer drug taxol which can be prepared from
optically active 2,3-dihydroxy-3-phenylpropionates
(Denis, J.-N., et al. J. Org. Chem.1990, 55, 1957).
Also, optically pure 2,3-dihydroxy-3-arylpropionates
prepared from cinnamate esters have been used to
produce antihypertensive drugs such as Diltiazem (PCT
AU88/00345). Also, optically pure stilbene diol
(hydrobenzoin) from stilbene has been used as chiral
ligand for Lewis-acid catalyzed asymmetric Diels-Alder
reactions
