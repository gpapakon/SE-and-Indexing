<ABSTRACT>
A fastening machine (e.g. for rivets) has a fastening head (20) where the fasteners (30) are brought into alignment with the punch (22) and die in a carrier tape (10). The carrier tape (10) has a web (11) with slots (15, 16) or teeth engageable by a sprocket wheel (27) which sequentially advances the fasteners (30) until the stems (31) engage a retractable stop (32). When the punch (22) is advanced, the fasteners (30) are pushed through the carrier tape (10) to be deformed by an upsetting die aligned with the punch (22). In modified embodiments, the fasteners (30) are urged transversely from the web of the carrier tape, the carrier tape being advanced by a gear which engages teeth on a side flange on the carrier tape. The sprocket wheel (27) may be remotely driven e.g. by a flexible cable drive to accommodate the movement as the fastening head (20) is advanced towards, or retracted from, the upsetting die.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates generally to fastening tools and fastener-carrying tapes therefor and is concerned in particular with a feeding head for a fastening machine in accordance with the pre-characterising portion of claims 1 and 6, respectively.A feeding head of this type is known from US-A-4615475.The term "fastener" shall include rivets, screws and other fastening devices.US-A-4,615,475 (Fuhrmeister) (= AU-B-28506/84 (556811) = International Publication No. WO84/04710) discloses a feeder for headed fasteners, where the fasteners, mounted in tape, are sequentially advanced into alignment with the punch and die assembly of a fastening machine by an oscillating actuator, which is timed by the plunger holding the punch, the actuator releasably engaging the heads of the fasteners to advance the fasteners.The feeder, and the fastening machine, has proved commercially successful in a wide range of industries. There are certain applications, however, e.g. in the automotive and white goods industries, where the dimensions of the feeding head preclude the use of the fastening machine to fasten components together, where limited space is available.In addition, the minimum radius of curvature of the tape entering and leaving the feeder head also limits the reduction of size of the feeder hereinbefore described to suit such applications.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved feeding head for the fastening machine which enables the fastening machine to be used in confined spaces.It is a further preferred object to provide a feeder where the fasteners stems or shanks are engaged as the fasteners are advanced by the punch to prevent the fasteners from tilting or becoming misaligned with the die assembly.It is a still further preferred object to providing a feeding head in a remote, fixed position spaced from the punch and die assembly, with a different orientation, for improved access.It is a still further preferred object to provide a remote drive for the feeding head.Other preferred objects will become apparent from the following description.The term "fastening machine" shall be hereinafter used to refer to fastening machines of the type disclosed in US-A-4,615,475 discussed above, subject to the modifications and improvements hereinafter described and illustrated, but shall not be limited to such machines.The term "stem" of a fastener shall be hereinafter used to also include a "shank" of a fastener.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a feeding head for
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A feeding head for a fastening machine including:

a feeder block (20) mountable on a plunger (21) having a punch (22);
a guide path (23) in the block (20);
a fastener guide passage (26), aligned with the punch (22), below the guide path (23);
carrier tape drive means (27,51) to push or pull fastener carrier tape (10) through the guide path (23);
an inlet guide passage or tube (24) that guides the carrier tape (10) from a source to the guide path (23), a similar outlet guide passage (25) that guides the empty carrier tape (10) from the guide path (23);
the carrier tape (10) passing around sprockets (27, 51) as it changes direction entering and leaving the guide path (23), the sprockets having ratchet means (54) to index the advance of the carrier tape (10) and/or prevent its retraction as the punch (22) is advanced towards a die of the machine, 
characterised by
: head stop means (32) provided in the guide path (23) and releasably engageable with the head of the fastener (30), to cause the carrier tape to be selectively indexed into alignment with the punch so that on descent of the punch (22), the punch (22) will drive the fastener (30) from the carrier tape (10) into the fastener guide passage (26); and sensor means (34, 38) comprising a limit switch (38), proximity sensor or light switch provided in the feeder block (20) to sense when the fastener (30) is aligned with the punch (22) and die to shut off the carrier tape drive means (27, 51) and/or to initiate the advance of the punch towards the fasteners, the carrier tape (10) being held against movement until the punch (22) is withdrawn from the carrier tape (10).
A feeding head according to claim 1, the sensor means further comprising a spring-loaded finger (34) that is triggered by the fastener when it is aligned with the punch (22).
A fastening machine having a feeding head according to claim 1 or 2, and further 
characterised by
 a flexible drive (106) comprising:

a motor (100) mounted on or adjacent to a frame (102) of the fastening machine (107), the fastening machine (107) having an upper jaw (101) carrying the feeding head and a lower jaw having an upsetting die;
at least one sprocket on the upper jaw (101) and movable therewith to advance the carrier tape to index fasteners into alignment with the punch;
a right-angled drive (105) having an output operably connected to the sprocket; and
a telescopic drive shaft (103) operably connecting the input of the right-angled drive (105) to the motor (100), so arranged to maintain operable driving connection between the motor (100) and the right-angled drive (105) as the feeding head or punch is advanced towards, or retracted from the lower jaw.
A fastening machine having a feeding head as claimed in claim 1 or 2, and further 
characterised by
 a flexible drive comprising:

a motor (110) mounted on or adjacent to a frame (112) of the fastening machine, the machine having an upper jaw carrying the feeding head and a lower jaw having an upsetting die;
a right-angled drive (111) having an input operably connected to the motor (110) and its output operably connected to at least on of said sprockets by a flexible cable drive (114) to maintain operable driving connection between the motor (110) and the sprockets as the feeder head or punch is advanced towards, or retracted from, the lower jaw.
A fastening machine of the type having a frame with an upper jaw carrying a feeder head as claimed in claim 1 or 2, and a fixed lower jaw having an upsetting die, and further 
characterised by
 a flexible drive comprising:

a motor (120, 130) mounted remotely from the frame; and
a flexible cable drive (124, 134) interconnecting the motor to the sprocket (122, 132) to maintain operable driving connection therebetween as the feeder head or punch is advanced towards, or retracted from the lower jaw.
A fastening machine as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, further 
characterised by
:

the motor, right-angled drive, or the sprocket(s) incorporate a ratchet, a cam, a one-way roller clutch, or like one-way drive means so that the carrier tape can only travel in one direction, to advance the fasteners to the punch during the fastening cycle.
