<ABSTRACT>
In a frequency-shifted, low gain pulsed tunable laser (1), spatial and temporal build-up of regions of high intensity in the fundamental frequency is minimized by generating a frequency-narrowed fundamental wavelength, preferentially frequency shifting high energy portions of the fundamental wavelength, and separating the frequency-shifted portion. The remaining fundamental frequency can safely be coupled into a fiber optic delivery means (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides laser apparatus having high 
power, pulsed output wherein temporal and spatial power peaks 
are minimized, so that the output beam is suitable for 
coupling into fiber optic means while avoiding damage to the 
fiber optics and/or to the optical resonator. The apparatus 
is particularly suited for applications where flexibility in 
the beam delivery means is desired, such as in medical 
applications. Low gain tunable solid state laser media, when operated 
in the pulsed mode (especially when operated in the 
Q-switched pulsed mode) under conditions of high peak power 
and high energy have a tendency to develop "hot spots" in the 
spatial beam profile. "Hot spots" are localized areas of 
energy concentration in the cross-section of the beam, so 
that the beam lacks spatial uniformity. Furthermore, the beam 
generated under these conditions will also be afflicted with 
temporal power peaks, sometimes referred to as "spikes". 
These spatial and temporal power peaks tend to cause optical 
damage to the input end of fiber optic delivery means into 
which one may wish to couple the beam. The present invention has as its object the provision of 
a more uniform spatial beam profile in high power operation 
of a tunable low gain solid state laser, to make the beam 
suitable for coupling into a fiber optic beam delivery means 
under avoidance of damage to the fiber optic. A further 
object is the provision of such a beam having a more uniform 
spatial beam profile while at the same time minimizing  
 
temporal energy peaks. These and other objects of the invention are achieved by 
the provision of a high power, pulsed solid-state laser 
apparatus (see claim 1) comprising, in combination: 
(a) a low gain tunable laser medium; (b) means for exciting the laser medium to emit coherent 
radiation at a fundamental wavelength; (c) reflecting means associated with the laser medium 
defining a resonant laser cavity for supporting coherent 
oscillation within the laser medium, the reflecting means 
comprising at least one output coupler; (d) means for narrowing the frequency distribution of 
the coherent radiation emitted by the exited laser medium; (e) non-linear frequency conversion means located within 
the resonant laser cavity, for transforming a portion of the 
coherent oscillation generated and supported within the laser 
cavity from its frequency-narrowed fundamental wavelength to 
a frequency-shifted derivative thereof, to generate a mixed 
wavelength laser beam; (f) fiber optic means for
