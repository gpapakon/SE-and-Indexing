<ABSTRACT>
Porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene material having a microstructure of nodes interconnected by fibrils wherein a surface of the material has been modified to have increased hydrophobicity as indicated by having a water droplet roll-off angle of less than about 10 degrees in comparison to a typical roll-off angle of greater than about 12 degrees for the unmodified material. Under magnification, the surface morphology may be indistinguishable from that of the unmodified precursor material. The modification is preferably done by exposing the surface to radio frequency gas plasma discharge with a reactive etching gas for a lengthy amount of time such as about ten minutes. If surface etching is continued beyond a time adequate to produce the highly hydrophobic behavior, then the surface morphology includes the appearance of broken fibrils. Still further treatment results in complete removal of fibrils from the surface so that under magnification the surface has the appearance of freestanding node portions not interconnected by fibrils but rather having open valleys disposed between the freestanding node portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
It has long been known to use various surface modification 
techniques including glow discnarge plasma to change the surface 
characteristics of polymeric materials. For example, it may be 
advantageous to improve the bondability of an implantable polymeric 
medical device or to change the wettability of a polymeric fabric. 
Fluorocarbons have frequently been used as both the surface modified 
substrate materials and as materials used to modify surfaces of other 
polymeric substrates. These surface modifications can take several forms. Plasma 
polymerization by radio frequency gas plasma using polymerizing gases 
can polymerize a new material onto the surface of another substrate. 
Unsaturated fluorocarbon gas plasmas can be used, for example, to 
polymerize a fluorocarbon layer onto a polystyrene substrate. 
Alternatively, plasma activation is used with non-polymer forming 
gases such as oxygen or saturated fluorocarbons to chemically modify a 
substrate surface. The plasma activation of a fluoropolymer substrate 
surface with oxygen gas, for example, can result in the replacement of 
fluorine atoms from the substrate surface with oxygen in order to 
ennance the wettability of that surface. Still another tecnnique is 
plasma cleaning or plasma etching where a reactive gas plasma is used 
to etch or roughen a surface oy removing quantities of the substrate 
material comprising the surface. This can be done for surface 
cleaning or for increasing bondability, for example. Etching can also 
be accomplished with other energy sources such as ion beams. Masking 
techniques can be used to selectively etch portions of a surface to  
 
produce a desired pattern. Alternatively, specific surface patterns 
can be produced in polymeric surfaces by molding techniques well known 
to those skilled in the art. Plasma polymerization, plasma activation and plasma etching are 
all considered to be specific types of plasma treatment but are not 
considered as mutually exclusive categories. The plasma etching of 
some substrates to enhance bondability is, for example, sometimes 
called plasma activation. An article in Medical Product Manufacturing News (Using Gas 
Plasma to Re-engineer Surfaces, Nancy B. Mateo, Sept/Oct 1990), 
provides a general description of known gas plasma surface 
modification methods. The author states that increasing surface 
wettability and adhesiveness are among the most routine uses for gas 
plasmas. U.S. Patent 4,919,659 to Horbett, et al., teaches the
