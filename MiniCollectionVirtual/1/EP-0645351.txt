<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating composition 
for glass containers, which is coated onto the outer surface 
upon recycling glass containers for beer, juice, mineral water, 
etc. to enhance the appearance as well as masking scratches. The glass containers for beer, juice, mineral water, etc. 
are repeatedly used by a collection system. When repeatedly 
using these bottles, scratches can generate on the outer 
surface due to mutual rubbing of bottles in the 
filling and distribution process to injure the appearance and 
to decrease the commercial value of bottled beverages. Upon 
recycling, therefore, it is necessary to coat a coating agent 
onto the portion of scratches, thus masking the scratches 
inconspicuous and enhancing the appearance at the same time. 
The portions of bottles violently generating the scratches 
are approximately fixed; for example, in the case of common 
beer bottles in Japan, the generation of scratches are violent  
 
at the positions of 1 to 2 cm, 5 to 7 cm and 13 to 
15 cm from the bottom. For this reason and other various 
conditions, partial coating such as two or three-stripe 
coating or the like, wherein the coating liquor is 
applied only onto the portions of violent scratches, is generally 
carried out. However, the scratches sometimes generate 
at positions other than those fixed positions, 
thus improvement in the working process is required for 
beautifully finishing even such portions. In order to cope with such problems, some coating 
compositions for the scratches of glass containers have so far 
been proposed. For example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. Sho 57-179053, a composition using dimethylpolysiloxane 
together with aminomethylpolysiloxane is disclosed. 
Also, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Sho 59-145259, 
a composition having liquid paraffin as a major ingredient 
and using small amounts of higher alcohol fatty acid 
ester and polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester in combination 
is disclosed. Furthermore, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. Sho 62-128951, a composition containing acetylated 
glycerine fatty acid ester as an essential ingredient has also been 
disclosed. While these are favorable compositions for said 
partial coating processes, they are unsuitable in several points 
when considering overall coating process by the shower or 
spray method of coating liquor or with sponge aiming at the 
improvement in the partial coating process and the beautiful 
finishing of overall bottle surface. If
