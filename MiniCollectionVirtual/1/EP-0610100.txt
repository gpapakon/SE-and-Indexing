<ABSTRACT>
A thermo-formed tray (3) carries staggered rows of 
bottles (1) as one of five such trays stacked one upon 

the other. The tray (3) is stacked on the tops of 
bottles (1) of the tray immediately below, with the tops 

engaged in channels (9) of the tray's under-surface (7). 
The closed-end channels (9) are defined by troughs (6) 

and (10) in an upper-surface (5) of the tray (3) that is 
otherwise flat within a peripheral wall (4). The troughs 

(6) are of short lengths so that the walls (8) of the 
channels (9) are interrupted to relieve frictional 

resistance against removal of the tray (3) from the 
bottles (1) below, and in regions (11) are omitted 

altogether to allow the tray to be lifted by suction 
pads. An orderly array of the bottles (1) in maintained 

in spite of the lack of row-constraint on the tops of the 
bottles (1) where the channel walls (8) are interrupted 

in both these ways, by virtue of abutment of the bottles 
(1) upon one another within their rows and also between 

adjacent rows. As an alternative (Figure 5), troughs are 
omitted other than along the sides (26) of the array and 

at the ends of the rows (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to storage and/or transit stacking 
of articles. The invention is more particularly concerned with methods 
of stacking bottles or other articles, of the kind in 
which a plurality of arrays of rows of the articles are 
stacked one upon the other with each array standing on an 
upper-surface of an individual one of a plurality of 
trays in the stack, and in which restraint against 
lateral movement of articles out of their rows is 
exercised by engagement of tops of individual ones of the 
articles with walls which are configured in the under-surface 
of the tray immediately above in the stack for 
effectively defining in such under-surface a multiplicity 
of parallel channels for receiving the tops of the 
respective rows of articles, the ends of the channels 
being closed individually by the walls to restrain the 
articles from movement longitudinally of their rows. Methods of this specified kind are described in GB-A-2257121 
for stacking flasks and other bottles for safe 
storage and transport. The trays used in these methods 
are each of a thermo-formed sheet construction in which 
the walls of channels engaged on the under-surface by the 
tops of the bottles, are configured by elongate troughs 
in the upper-surface. The trays of bottles are stacked 
one upon the other with the bottom tray standing on a 
pallet and each of the others resting on the tops of the 
array of bottles beneath. A further tray is placed on 
the tops of the bottles of the uppermost array to 
complete the stack in preparation for bonding the stack  
 
together and to the pallet, using, for example, a 
plastics-film envelope thermally shrunk on. It is one of the objects of the present invention to 
provide a method of stacking bottles or other articles, 
of the kind specified, that is of improved form. According to one aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a method of stacking bottles or other articles, 
of the kind specified, characterised in that at least 
some of the walls for restraining inner rows of the array 
are interrupted at one or more intervals along the 
lengths of the defined channels. The present invention is based upon the realisation that 
it is not necessary for the tops of all the bottles or 
other articles of a row to be engaged with row-constraining 
walls of the tray above in the stack. It 
has been found that provided the tops of some of the 
articles of a row are engaged, and more especially the 
tops of the articles at either end of the row, adequate 
restraint
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of stacking bottles or other articles, in 
which a plurality of arrays of rows of the articles (1) 

are stacked one upon the other with each array standing 
on an upper-surface (5;25) of an individual one of a 

plurality of trays (3) in the stack, and in which 
restraint against lateral movement of articles (1) out of 

their rows is exercised by engagement of tops of 
individual ones of the articles (1) with walls (8;28) 

which are configured in the under-surface (7;27) of the 
tray immediately above in the stack for effectively 

defining in such under-surface (7;27) a multiplicity of 
parallel channels (9;30) for receiving the tops of the 

respective rows of articles (1), the ends of the channels 
(9;30) being closed individually by the walls (8;28) to 

restrain the articles (1) from movement longitudinally of 
their rows, characterised in that at least some of the 

walls (8;28) for restraining inner rows of the array are 
interrupted at one or more intervals along the lengths of 

the defined channels (9;30). 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the articles 
(1) of adjacent rows of each array abut one another such 

that where, owing to interruptions in the walls (8;28), 
individual ones of the articles (1) would otherwise be 

without restraint against lateral movement, such 
restraint is provided by abutment with others of the 

articles (1). 
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein at 
least some of the trays in the stack are of sheet-moulded 

construction and each has the walls (8) of its under-surface 
(7) configured by troughs (6,10) in its upper-surface 

(5), and wherein a plurality of flat, unbroken  
 

regions (11) on the upper-surface (5) of the tray are 
defined by the interruptions of the walls (8). 
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the 
walls (28) are limited in their extent by the 

interruptions to provide substantially solely outer sidewalls 
(28) to the under-surface (27) and the closed ends 

of the channels (30). 
A method according to any one of Claims 1, 2 or 4 
wherein at least some of the trays in the stack are of 

sheet-moulded construction and each has the walls (28) of 
its under-surface (27) configured by troughs (26,30) in 

its upper-surface, and wherein interruptions of the walls 
(28) along the lengths of the channels define a flat, 

unbroken region bounded by the troughs (26,30) on the 
upper-surface (25) of the tray. 
A tray for retaining bottles or other articles in an 
array of rows of a plurality of such arrays stacked one 

upon the other with the array standing on an upper-surface 
of the tray and with tops of individual ones of 

articles (1) of an array immediately below in the stack 
engaged with walls (8;28) configured in the under-surface 

(7;27) of the tray for restraining those articles (1) 
from lateral movement out of their rows, the walls (8;28) 

effectively defining in the under-surface (7;27) a 
multiplicity of parallel channels (9;30) for receiving 

the tops of the respective rows of articles (1) of the 
array immediately below, and the ends of the channels 

(9;30) being closed individually by the walls (8;28) to 
restrain those articles (1) from movement longitudinally 

of their rows, characterised in that at least some of the 
walls (8;28) for restraining inner rows of the array 

immediately below, are interrupted at one or more 
intervals along the lengths of the defined channels 

(9;30).  
 
A tray according to Claim 6 of sheet-moulded 
construction wherein the walls (8) are configured by 

troughs (6,10) in its upper-surface (5), and wherein a 
plurality of flat, unbroken regions (11) on the upper-surface 

(5) of the tray are defined by the interruptions 
of the walls (8). 
A tray according to Claim 6 wherein the walls (28) 
are limited in their extent by the interruptions to 

provide substantially solely outer side-walls (28) to the 
under-surface (27) and the closed ends of the channels 

(30). 
A tray according to Claim 6 or Claim 8 of sheet-moulded 
construction wherein the walls (28) are 

configured by troughs (26,30) in its upper-surface (25), 
and wherein interruptions of the walls (28) along the 

lengths of the channels (30) define a flat, unbroken 
region bounded by the troughs (26,30) on the upper-surface 

(25). 
A tray according to any one of Claims 6 to 9 having 
a peripheral wall (4;24) upstanding from its upper-surface 

(5;25) for restraining lateral movement of 
articles on the upper-surface (5;25).
