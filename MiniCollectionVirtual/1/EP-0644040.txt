<ABSTRACT>
A composite material (23) is placed on a support surface (78), and a 
compaction frame (63) is positioned proximal to said support surface. The frame 

comprises a first compaction element (73) and a second compaction element (90), 
and a fluid actuator (79, 80, 82) is provided on the frame (63) to power said 

compaction elements. The fluid actuator is operative to cause the first 
compaction element to apply a first compaction force to said material, and to 

cause the second compaction element to apply a second compaction force to said 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
In general, his invention relates to machines which lay strips of 
composite material onto a surface, and particularly but not exclusively, where it 
is desirable to compact strips having tails, i.e., trailing sections of material which 
are less than full strip width. In particular, this invention relates to compaction 
of composite tape by a compactor having at least two levels of compaction force. In the field of advanced composites, where a composite tape of fibre 
reinforced resin is laid on a tool to create laminated structures such as aircraft 
parts, it is necessary to lay progressive runs of tape at angles other than 90° and 
0° with the tool. When laying cross plies, for example at 45°, it is often necessary 
to cut the end of the tape strip at some angle other than 90° with the tape length, 
and a problem may arise when a primary compacting member spans adjacent 
pieces, which are carried on a backing. US-A-4557783 addresses the problem of tail compaction in a 
composite tape laying machine. The machine and compaction device are shown 
herein as Prior Art Figures 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c. The entire disclosure and teaching 
of the '783 patent is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Prior art Figure 
1 depicts a high rail gantry tape laying machine 10 wherein a tape laying head 11 
is transported coordinately on horizontal side rails 12 and transverse gantry rails 
13 under a program commanded by a numerical control (NC) unit 14. A 
contoured tape laydown surface 15, or tool, is positionable with respect to the 
tape laying head 11 to form laminated composite structures. The tape laying head 
11 comprises, in part, a main frame 16 supporting a tape supply reel 17. The 
supply reel 17 carries a tape structure 18 comprising a filamentous composite tape 
and a paper backing. The tape structure 18 is trained under a tape compactor 
unit 19 and backing is accumulated on a take-up reel 20, in a manner well-known 
in the art. The tape laying head 11 is movable along a vertical, or Z-axis 21 to 
adapt to changing tool heights along the tape path, and the entire tape head 11 
is rotatable around the vertical axis 21. Figure 2a depicts a schematic of the tape 
laying head 11 movable in a direction "X" with respect to a tool 22. The tape 
laying head 11 has a supply reel 17 which feeds out a tape structure 18 comprising  
 
a composite tape 23 releasably attached to a backing 24 such as a paper strip. 
The tape structure 18 feeds through a cutter unit 25 and tape guide chute 26 to 
its lowermost

<CLAIMS>
A method of compacting composite material comprising the steps: 

a) placing composite material (23, 200, 207) on a support surface (78); 
b) positioning a compaction assembly (61) proximal said support surface; 
c) applying a compacting force to said composite material by said 
compaction assembly at a first pressure; and 
d) applying a compacting force to said composite material by said 
compaction assembly at a second pressure. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the compacting force at said 
first pressure is applied to said composite material by a first compacting element 

(73) carried by the assembly (61).
