<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a television (referred to hereinafter as 
TV)-integrated video cassette recorder (referred to hereinafter as VCR) apparatus, and 
more particularly to a TV-integrated digital VCR apparatus in which a digital VCR is 
interfaced with a high definition television (referred to hereinafter as HDTV) or a 
standard TV to record and play back data of a HDTV format or of a standard TV format. A standard TV system such as, for example, an NTSC system has generally been 
used till now, while a HDTV system has recently been developed and will be 
commercially available in the near future. Although the HDTV system will be 
commercially available, it is anticipated that the standard TV system will coexist with the 
HDTV system for a long time. On the other hand, compatibility is required between the standard TV system and 
the HDTV system in the case where a digital VCR intends to record an NTSC 
broadcasting signal as well as a HDTV broadcasting signal, to convert the HDTV 
broadcasting signal into the NTSC broadcasting signal for playback or to convert the 
NTSC broadcasting signal into the HDTV broadcasting signal for the playback. For example, trick playback modes of the NTSC system such as edit & dubbing, 
a high-speed playback and etc. are difficult to perform with a HDTV broadcasting signal 
format. For this reason, there is a necessity for efficiently applying the trick playback  
 
modes of the NTSC system to the HDTV system. Also, recording modes of the NTSC 
system such as a standard play (SP), a long play (LP) and etc. must readily be applied 
to the HDTV system. Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problem, and 
it is an object of the present invention to provide a TV-integrated VCR apparatus which 
is capable of recording and playing back both a HDTV broadcasting signal and a standard 
TV broadcasting signal to provide compatibility between a standard TV system and a 
HDTV system. In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be 
accomplished by a provision of a television-integrated video cassette recorder apparatus 
comprising a high definition television for receiving a high definition television signal 
from a broadcasting station; a digital video cassette recorder for recording and playing 
back the high definition television signal or a standard television signal on/from a 
magnetic tape; and interface means for converting a format of the high definition 
television signal into a recording format
