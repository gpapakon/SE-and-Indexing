<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the invention to provide a process for preparing stock solution compositions for especially blood dialysis, and also to provide soft bags employed in said process. Soft bags are prepared each of which contains powder components of a stock solution composition for preferably blood dialysis and preferably containing a stirrer. A predetermined amount of water or a water solution is supplied to the soft bag, and the contents of the soft bag are stirred by means of a magnetic field, so that the aimed stock solution composition can be prepared very easily in a short period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A STOCK SOLUTION COMPOSITION FOR A MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND A SOFT BAG TO BE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF SAID STOCK SOLUTION COMPOSITIONIndustrial field of the inventionThe present invention relates to a process for preparing a stock solution composition for a medical treatment such as dialysis, preferably hemodialysis, hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration, and a soft bag intended to be used for said preparation.Preferably, the present invention relates to a process for preparing stock solution compositions for medical 

use in the blood dialysis, particularly in the dialysis by artificial kidneys, and also relates to sof bags to be used for preparing such solution compositions. [0002]Solution compositions for medical use in the blood dialysis are commercially prepared by drug manufacturers in the form of stock solution composi¬ tions having a predetermined concentration. Such stock compositions are supplied to hospitals and the like having therapeutic dialysis facilities. For instance, stock solution composition, comprising the necessary components in a predetermined concentration, is filled in a 10 liters container such as polyethylene container, and commercially supplied through a commission agent to a hospital or the like having a dialysis facility. In the case of so-called "bicarbo solution compositions for the dialysis" widely used in recent years, it is necessary to prepare not only a conventional stock solution composition for the dialysis but also a concentrated bicarbo solution composition. Therefore, as far as bicarbo solution compositions are concerned, the above-mentioned two kinds of stock solution compositions are separately filled in two containers, respectively, and supplied to therapeutic dialysis facilities. 

 [ 0003 ][Problems to be solved by the Invention]At present, conventional stock solution compositions for the dialysis are transported and supplied in the form of liquid, so that there are many problems as shown below. For instance, such conventional compositions have a liquid form, and therefore are undesirably large in their weight and volume, so that they are very inconvenient in transportation, storage and handling thereof. Furthermore, after the use of the solution composi¬ tions, many emptied polyester containers or the like remain in dialysis facilities, so that it may sometimes be difficult for the facilities to discard the emptied containers in an adequate way.[0004][Means employed for solving the problems]The present inventors have made various
