<ABSTRACT>
An endermic nutrient material comprising as an 
effective component a saponified product of 

docosahexaenoic acid and/or a derivative thereof. A 
cosmetic composition containing such an endermic nutrient 

material is also disclosed. The cosmetic composition 
comprises i) at least one cosmetic component selected from 

fats and oils, waxes, hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, 
alcohols, inorganic salts, dyes, pigments, perfumes, 

antiseptics and antioxidants, and ii) the saponified 
product of DHA and/or a derivative thereof, contained in 

an amount of 0.1% to 50% by weight. 
The endermic nutrient material has the 
characteristic of permeating the skin and being absorbed 

therein, and being not liable to be oxidized. Hence, when 
cosmetics containing this endermic nutrient material are, 

for example, rubbed into the skin, it is possible for the 
DHA to be absorbed in human bodies by everyday and simple 

application, so that it can be expected to have an effect 
of various physiological activities possessed by the DHA 

and/or derivatives thereof and an effect of treating 
psoriasis and atopic dermatosis. A velvety and moist feel 

can also be imparted to the skin. Any fish odor 
undesirable for cosmetics can also be prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an endermic (percutaneously 
absorptive) nutrient material having as an effective 
component a saponified product of docosahexaenoic acid 
and/or a derivative thereof, and a cosmetic composition 
containing such an endermic nutrient material. In recent years, various physiological activities 
possessed by docosahexaenoic acid (hereinafter "DHA") have 
attracted notice. For example, proposals are made on its 
application in a remedy for diabetic complication 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 60-248610), a 
remedy for hemorrhoides (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 61-24518), a lipoxynase metabolism stimulant 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 63-230632), a 
carcinostatic (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 1-153629), 
an antiallergic agent (Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-open No. 2-290812), a brain function 
improver (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 1-290625), 
a remedy for cystic kidney (Japanese Patent  
 
Application Laid-open No. 2-235811) and a remedy for 
cardiac dysrhythmia (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 4-29928). As shown above, DHA is known to have various 
physiological activities, and various remedies utilizing 
such physiological activities of DHA are proposed. In all 
of these conventional remedies, DHA is orally or 
intraveneously administered so that the remedies can be 
efficacious. However, some people dislike its oral administration 
because DHA produces an unpleasant odor similar to a fish 
odor especially when oxidized in the air. Meanwhile, its 
intraveneous administration must be conducted in medical 
facilities such as hospitals under supervision of doctors, 
and it has been difficult for DHA to have the intended 
efficacy by its everyday application. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
endermic (percutaneously absorptive) nutrient material 
that can make it possible to more effectively bring out 
the physiological activities possessed by DHA, and a 
cosmetic composition containing such an endermic nutrient 
material. The present inventors have made researches for years  
 
on the use of DHA and/or derivatives thereof. In the 
course of their researches, they have discovered that a 
soap containing DHA and/or a derivative thereof have an 
effect of treating psoriasis, atopic dermatosis or the 
like and also an effect for making the skin velvety and 
moist, and have disclosed it in Japanese patent 
applications (see Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open 
No. 6-40887, No. 6-136393
