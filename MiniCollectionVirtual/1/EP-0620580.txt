<ABSTRACT>
Auxiliary trip device (1) for a circuit breaker, comprising: a coil (10) surrounding a sheath (18), in the sheath, a fixed core (22), a movable core (24), a pusher (28) linked to the movable core and a first spring (30) continuously pressing the pusher in the direction of increasing the dimensions of an air gap; and an energy-accumulation system including a blade (4), a second spring (8) and a latch (55) hooked to the blade and movable in order to liberate it by unhooking. According to the invention, the said second spring (8) is stronger than the said first spring (30) and an actuating part (32) of the pusher (28) pushes on an actuating part (62) of the latch (55), a clearance being provided between the said actuating part (32) of the pusher and the said actuating part (62) of the latch when the pusher is not displaced.

An auxiliary trip device (1) for a circuit breaker, 

said circuit breaker comprising : a circuit breaker operating mechanism ; a trip bar 
movable in such a way as to bring about breaking of the latching of the circuit breaker 

operating mechanism ; and at least one main trip device designed to command 
movement of the trip bar, 
said auxiliary trip device (1) comprising, in a trip device case : an electromechanical 
actuating device including a coil (10) surrounding a sheath (18), in the sheath, a fixed 

core (22), a plunger (24) defining an air-gap (26) with the fixed core, a push-rod (28) 
connected to the plunger and a first spring (30) continuously pushing the push-rod in 

the direction increasing the size of the air-gap (26) ; and an energy storage system 
including a blade (4) designed to command movement of said trip bar, a second 

spring (8) storing energy to actuate the blade and a latch (55) latched to the blade 
and movable to release its latching to the blade, 
 
characterized in that : 


said second spring (8) stores and releases, during its movements in the course of 
operation of said auxiliary trip device (1), an energy greater than the energy stored 

and released by said first spring (30) during its movements in the course of operation 
of said electromechanical actuating device ; and 
an actuating part (32 or 34) of the push-rod (28) can push on an actuating part (62) of 
the latch (55) in such a way that movement of the latch in the direction of releasing of 

its latching to the blade is caused by movement of the push-rod (28) in a specific 

direction, a clearance being provided between said actuating part (32 or 34) of the 
push-rod and said actuating part (62) of the latch when the push-rod is not moved in 

said specific direction. 
The auxiliary trip device according to claim 1, characterized in that : 

the push-rod (28) is fixed to the plunger (24) and extends slidingly through the fixed 
core (22) ; 
the first spring (30) surrounds the push-rod and exerts a thrust at the level of its two 
ends respectively on the fixed core and on the plunger, in the direction of their 

separation away from one another; 
the external diameter of the fixed core (22) is greater than the external diameter of the 
plunger (24) ; and 
the sheath (18) has a central hole which passes longitudinally through said sheath 
(18) and which comprises a first bore (42) opening out onto a first end, a second bore  

 
(46) of appreciably the same diameter and opening out onto an opposite second end, 

and a middle part (50) of a smaller diameter than that of said first and second bores ; 
which results in the assembly formed by the fixed core (22), plunger (24), push-rod 

(28) and first spring (30) being able to be mounted inside the hole of the sheath (18) 
in the following two manners : either by housing the fixed core (22) fixedly in the first 

bore (42 in figure 2) so as to constitute an auxiliary trip device of the undervoltage 
release type or by housing the fixed core (22) fixedly in the second bore (46 in figure 

3) so as to constitute an auxiliary trip device of the shunt release type.
