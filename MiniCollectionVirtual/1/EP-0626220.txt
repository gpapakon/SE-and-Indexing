<ABSTRACT>
A wire-guiding body for a wire-drawing machine, in particular a drawing drum or a drawing cylinder, is configured such that it is essentially rotationally symmetrical about a longitudinal axis (22) and can rotate about this axis. The wire-guiding body (20) comprises a base body (21), consisting of a carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic, and exhibits a coating (25) which is made of a wear-resistant material, which is preferably a ceramic layer. Preferably, a thin layer (24) consisting of a molybdenum-containing material is arranged between the base body and the ceramic coating.
