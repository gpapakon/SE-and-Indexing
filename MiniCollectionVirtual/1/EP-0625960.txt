<ABSTRACT>
Sewage treatment apparatus comprising a tank (10), aeration means which serve to aerate a biomass contained within the tank (10) when the apparatus is in use, and air compressor means (48) which are connected to the aeration means (72) to deliver air thereto, in which the air compressor means (48) are in a housing (32) that forms a barrier between the housing interior and the tank interior, to inhibit transfer of gas or other material from the tank interior to the housing interior. Also sewage treatment apparatus comprising at least two tanks each containing a biomass of treated sewage material when in use, duct means connected to respective influent inlets of those tanks, influent control means of the duct means constructed to cause sewage to pass to one of the tanks to the exclusion of the other throughout a period during which the amount of sewage received by the apparatus over a given amount of time is below a predetermined limit, and to cause sewage to pass to the other tank or the both tanks when that amount is above that limit, and biomass transfer means connected between those tanks to pass some of the biomass from the said one of the tanks to the other at predetermined intervals at least during such a period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sewage treatment
apparatus, especially but not exclusively for the treatment
of domestic sewage.Hitherto, one construction of such apparatus, referred
to as a septic tank, comprises a tank having an inlet and
an outlet, and baffles through which fluid passes in order
to flow from the inlet to the outlet. The baffles effect
a separation between solids and liquids of the influent.
The solids are broken down by micro-organisms within the
tank, to create a sludge which is removed regularly by a
suction tanker.Another previously proposed construction comprises a
rotary drum filter which separates solids from liquids in
the influent.In both these previously proposed forms of
construction, installation costs and time are relatively
high, as are the frequency, cost and time involved in
subsequently servicing such apparatus. Furthermore, the
reduction in the pollutants in the effluent, as compared
with those contained in the influent, may be considered
inadequate.The present invention seeks to obviate one or more of
the foregoing disadvantages.Accordingly the present invention is directed to
sewage treatment apparatus comprising a tank, aeration
means which serve to aerate a biomass contained within the
tank when the apparatus is in use, and air compressor means 
which are connected to the aeration means to deliver air
thereto, in which the air compressor means are in a housing
that forms a barrier between the housing interior and the
tank interior, to inhibit transfer of gas or other material
from the tank interior to the housing interior, in which
the tank has a top wall with an inner rim, the said housing
is modular and has an upper outer rim and a service cover,
and the housing is located within the tank with the said
upper outer rim of the housing engaging the said inner rim
of the top wall of the tank, whereby, when the apparatus is
installed for use, the said housing can be lowered into the
tank until the said upper outer rim engages the said inner
rim.It is desirable for the compressor to be readily
removable for servicing. To this end it may be mounted on
a separate panel which itself is readily removable from the
compartment. For example, the support panel may have edges
which slidingly engaged formations within the compartment.
These formations may be in the form of studs or other
projecting portions projecting from one or more interior
walls of the compartment.The compartment itself may be provided with a
servicing cover.Furthermore the compartment itself is held

<CLAIMS>
Sewage treatment apparatus comprising a tank (10),
aeration means (72), which serve to aerate a biomass

contained within the tank (10) when the apparatus is in
use, and air compr
essor means (48) which are connected to
the aeration means (72) to deliver air thereto,


characterised in that
 the air compressor means (72) are in
a housing (32) that forms a barrier between the housing

interior and the tank interior, to inhibit transfer of gas
or other material from the tank interior to the housing

interior, in which the tank (10) has a top wall (28) with
an inner rim (30), the said housing (32) is modular and has

an upper outer rim (40) and a service cover (36), and the
housing (32) is located within the tank (10) with the said

upper outer rim (40) of the housing (32) engaging the said
inner rim (30) of the top wall (28) of the tank (10),

whereby, when the apparatus is installed for use, the said
housing (32) can be lowered into the tank (10) until the

said upper outer rim (40) engages the said inner rim (30).
Sewage treatment apparatus according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the compressor means (48) is mounted
on a separate panel (42) which is located with the said

housing (32) and which is readily removable from the said
housing (32) for ease of servicing.
Sewage treatment apparatus according to claim 2,

characterised in that
 the said separate panel (42) has
edges which slidingly engage formations (46) within the 

said housing (32).
Sewage treatment apparatus according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 the said formations (46) are in the
form of studs (46) or other projecting portions projecting

from one or more interior walls of the said housing (32).
Sewage treatment apparatus according to claim 4,

characterised in that
 slots or recesses are formed in an
edge of the said separate panel (44) to enable the latter

to be swung clear of the said projecting portions (46)
after the panel (42) has been slightly raised.
Sewage treatment apparatus according to any one of
claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that
 connecting lines
(82, 84) between parts mounted on the said separate panel

(42) and other parts within the said housing (32) are
ducted through an umbilical cord to enable the said

separate panel (42) to be removed from the said housing
(32) without those lines being disconnected.
Sewage treatment apparatus according to any one of
claims 2 to 6, 
characterised in that
 an electrical control
unit (80) is also mounted on the said separate panel (42).
Sewage treatment apparatus according to any preceding
claim,
