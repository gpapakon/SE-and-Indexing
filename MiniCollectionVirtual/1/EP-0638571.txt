<ABSTRACT>
A quinoline derivative represented by general formula (1), a medicinally acceptable salt thereof, and a remedy for cardiac 
diseases containing the same, wherein ring A represents a furan, dihydrofuran or dioxolane ring, R¹ represents hydroxy, carboxy, 

alkoxycarbonyl, etc., R²s may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, alkyl, etc., R³ 
and R⁴ may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, amino, alkoxy, etc., R⁵, 

R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ may be the same or different from one another and each represents hydrogen or alkyl, m represents an integer 
of 0 to 3, and symbol ...... means that there may be a double bond formed by R⁶ and R⁸. The compound (1) has a positively 

inotropic effect on myocardia and an antiarrhythmic effect and can dilate blood vessels without extremely increasing the 
heart rate. Therefore, a remedy for cardiac diseases containing the same as the active ingredient is remarkably useful for 

treating cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmia, and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel quinoline 
derivatives and medicinally acceptable salts thereof, which 
have pharmaceutical actions including positive inotropic 
action, antiarrhythmic action and vasodilating action. The 
present invention also relates to use of the compounds as 
medicines. Congestive heart failure is a disease in which cardiac 
output deteriorates because of the malfunction of the heart, 
outputting only insufficient blood supply for the metabolism 
of tissue. Recently, J.N. Cohn has described the congestive 
heart failure as a syndrome caused by failure of the 
function of the heart which is accompanied by (1) 
deterioration of motor tolerance capacity, (2) multiple 
ventricular arrhythmia, and (3) signs indicating unfavorable 
symptoms (J.N. Cohn: Circulation 78, 1099 (1988)). To ameliorate the above symptom-complex, diuretic 
agents, vasodilators, and cardiac tonics such as digitalis 
have conventionally been employed. These days, digitalis agents are the most common 
cardiac tonics. Digoxin, one of the digitalis components, 
is known to promote the ejection of the heart, thereby 
preventing the cardiac insufficiency from aggravated.  
 
Digoxin has also remarkable advantages in that it lowers the 
cardiac rate, its effects last long, it does not have drug 
resistance, and it can be orally dosed. On the other hand, 
since the effective blood level of digoxin is close to its 
toxic level, it sometimes induces arrhythmia. Therefore, 
oral preparations of non-glycoside cardiac tonics have 
become of interest and, active studies are being made 
recently. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a compound useful for the treatment of heart 
diseases which is free from the above mentioned drawbacks, 
and which has positive inotropic action, antiarrhythmic 
action and vasodilating action. Under the above mentioned circumstances, the inventors 
of the present invention have synthesized many compounds, 
and have carried out screening of the compounds in view of 
the positive inotropic action, antiarrhythmic action and 
vasodilating action, and as a result, have found that the 
novel quinoline derivatives represented by the following 
formula (1) or their medicinally acceptable salts are suited 
for the above-mentioned purposes and are useful as medicines 
for the treatment of heart diseases, leading to completion 
of the invention. The present invention provides quinoline derivatives of 
the following formula (1) and medicinally acceptable salts 
thereof:
