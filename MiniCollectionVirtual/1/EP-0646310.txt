<ABSTRACT>
Method for removing the leaf of root crop while the latter remain 
in the ground, particularly potato haulm, in which a tensile load is 

exerted on the leaf, this being a tensile load of varying magnitude. A 
varying load is, during pulling, exerted thereon in such a manner that 

the maximum tensile load of each following load variation is at a higher 
level than the preceding one. In particular, the direction of the load 

is substantially in the horizontal plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device for removing the 
leaf of root crop while the latter remain in the ground, particularly 
potato haulm. However, the invention is not limited strictly to the 
above field of application of removing the leaf of root crops while the 
latter remain in the ground, but can rather be used for pulling all 
types of leafs which are anchored in the ground by roots. A leaf puller comprising two endless belts in a substantially 
horizontal plane is known from NL-A-7508386, in which the active parts 
which face each other determine a nip for clamping principally 
vertically upright leaf therebetween. By driving said parts in such a 
manner that they move backwards at a higher speed than that of the leaf 
puller moving forwards as a whole, said parts exert, on the leaf, a 
principally horizontal, rearwards-directed tensile force which, as a 
result of the displacement of said parts with respect to the initially 
stationary leaf, continually increases in a uniform manner until the 
breaking strain of the leaf is reached and said leaf will come free from 
the ground. The active parts of the puller belts are inclined upwardly 
towards the backward end, viewed in the direction of forward movement of 
the leaf puller, at about 5° with respect to the horizontal. Due to this 
slight inclination, the leaf comes free from the ground immediately 
after it is pulled, such that clogging of pulled leaf at the backward 
end of the leaf puller is prevented. It has been shown that there are 
still shortcomings when using the known leaf puller. Firstly, there is the danger that, during pulling of the leaf, 
root crops are also pulled out of the ground, these subsequently being 
lost to harvesting. Secondly, not all the leaf is removed in a reliable 
manner. From NL-C-85179 a leaf puller is known, also having two opposing 
driving belts in a common plane inclined to the horizontal, the active 
parts of which providing a nip for clamping leaf between them. The 
active parts are straight, and the width of the nip gradually decreases 
towards the beackward end, viewed in the direction of forward movement 
of the leaf puller. Due to the decreasing width of the nip, the leaf is 
only firmly held between the belts at the bachward end of the leaf 
puller, while in the forward end the belts slip along the leaf, such 
that the leaf will be erected. The inlination of the belts with respect  
 
to the horizontal is substantial larger than 10° and is such that leaf 
caught in the nip will be pulled

<CLAIMS>
Method for removing the leaf of root crop while the latter remain 
in the ground, in particular potato haulm, in which a principally 

horizontal, increasing tensile load is exerted on the leaf, 
characterized in that the tensile load has a cyclic increase towards 

maximum at break of the leaf, such that the leaf will break under 
fatigue. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein, at each cycle the load 
drops from a maximum, while each next maximum is at a higher level. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein there are at least two 
load cycles before break of the leaf. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein there are at least 
three or four cycles, especially at least ten load cycles before break 

of the leaf. 
Method according to any of the preceeding claims, wherein the 
load is inclined to the horizontal no more then 20°, preferably no more 

then 10°, especially no more then about 5°. 
Method according to one of the preceding Claims, in which, in 
each load variation, the difference between the minimum and the maximum 

load is at least 10% of the average load. 
Leaf puller for driving over a land area having driven pulling 
elements at some distance above the ground to grip and to exert a 

principally horizontal, increasing pulling force substantial parallel to 
the forward moving direction of the leaf puller on leaf growing above 

the ground, and free from elements for digging in the ground for 
possibly lifting root crop, characterized in that said pulling elements 

(6) are driven such that the pulling force will be cyclic increasing 
towards maximum at break of the leaf. 
Leaf puller according to claim 7, in which the pulling elements 
are rotating or circulating bodies which are mounted in a sub frame to 

be moveable to and fro parallel to the direction of advance of the leaf 
puller (fig. 2). 
Leaf puller according to claim 7, wherein the pulling elements 
are rotating or circulating bodies which are connected to a drive to be 

rotated or circulated at a cyclic changing speed. 
Leaf puller according to claim 7, wherein the pulling elements 
are bodies of revolution with a non-circular shape, e.g. an elliptical 

shape.
