<ABSTRACT>
A coprocessor is incorporated in a processor comprising a 
CPU, an instruction cache, a data memory, a bus controller, an 

interruption control section and a DMA controller. This 
coprocessor has a parallel sum-of-products arithmetic operation 

section, a comparator, an I/O register section, and a sum-of-products 
factor register section. A frame memory, provided on 

the input side, stores MUSE or NTSC signals digitized per pixel. 
The DMA is in control of the transfer of data between the input-side 

frame memory and the data memory as well as the transfer of 
data between a frame memory provided on the output side and the 

data memory. Pixel data stored in the data memory is processed 
according to broadcasting systems by the switching of sum-of-products 

factors on the basis of software.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video signal processor capable
of performing a process-switch function by software and to its
video signal processing technique.There have been demands for a television system capable of
providing a high resolution. To meet such demands, a television
system called the EDTV (Extended Definition Television) system
was introduced and has been put to practical use. The MUSE
(Multiple Sub-nyquist Sampling Encoding) system, which is one of
the HDTV (High-definition Television) systems, has been proposed,
and some of the MUSE systems have been put to practical use. It
is expected that advanced television systems such as an EDTV II
system (i.e., the second-generation EDTV) and a digital
television system will come in practice in the near future. In
view of these developments in the field of TV broadcasting
system, video signal processors including television receivers
and video tape recorders must be designed such a way that they
can receive broadcasting signals of different television systems
including the existing NTSC (National Television System
Committee) system. A conventional TV receiver has plural
different boards each of which corresponds to a respective
television system. These boards are exchanged depending on the
received signal. This technique is introduced as a background
technique of " Scan Line Conversion LSI for Wide Screen TV 
Receiver", ITEJ Technical Report, vol.16, No.71, pp.19-24,
BCS'92-41 (Oct., 1992) by Toshichika Satoh et al.How conventional TV receivers having a MUSE signal
processing board and a NTSC signal processing board operate is
described. According to the MUSE system standard, the sampling
rate = 16.2 MHz; the number of pixels (per scanning line) = 480;
and the number of scanning lines = 1125. On the other hand,
according to the NTSC system standard, the sampling rate = 14.3
MHz; the number of pixels (per scanning line) = 910; and the
number of scanning lines = 525.First, the MUSE signal is considered. The MUSE signal
processing board separates a received MUSE signal into a Y
signal, an R-Y signal, and a B-Y signal. In the MUSE system, in
order to make high vision signals fall within the specified
transmission bandwidth range, pixel data is band-compressed by
making use of the fact that pixels of a previous field coincide
with pixels of a current field in the case of an image without
movement and the fact that the human eye has poor resolving power
to an image with movement. Therefore, the MUSE processing board
performs different processes depending
