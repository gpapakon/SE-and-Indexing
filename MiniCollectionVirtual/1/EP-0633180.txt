<ABSTRACT>
The safety steering system for motor vehicles consists of a steering column (2) which bears the steering shaft (1) with the steering wheel and is attached to the body of the vehicle by means of bolts. The steering wheel-side receptable openings (27) for the attachment bolts are constructed as slots which are open towards the steering wheel. The receptacle openings which face away from the steering wheel are formed as elongated hole recesses (11) extending in the axial direction of the steering column. Between the end limiting edges of the elongated hole recesses (11) linearly extending limiting edges (14) are provided. The diameter (D) of the circular arc-shaped end limiting edge (12) which faces away from the steering wheel is greater than the distance between the essentially linearly extending limiting edges (14). A bolt-like attachment element which is provided at the end, facing away from the steering wheel, of the elongated hole recess (11) or a bushing or sleeve which is penetrated by the bolt-like attachment element has an external diameter which corresponds to the diameter (D) of the larger circular arc-shaped end limiting edge (12) of the elongated hole recess (11).

A safety steering system for motor vehicles, in particular for passenger cars, comprising a 
steering column (2) supporting the steering shaft (1) with the steering wheel and secured 

to the vehicle body by means of pin-like fastening elements (20, 37), wherein at least one 
receiving opening for a pin-like fastening element (20, 37) is constructed in the form of 

an elongate recess (11) extending in the axial direction of the steering column (2), 
wherein boundary edges (14) extending substantially straight are provided between the 

boundary edges (12, 13) at the end of the elongate recess (11), and the diameter of at 
least one circular boundary edge (12) at the end is greater than the distance between the 

boundary edges (14) extending substantially straight, and the pin-like fastening element 
(20, 37) received by the said end area of the elongate recess (11) has an external diameter 

which corresponds to the diameter (
D
) of the larger circular boundary edge (12) at the 
end of the elongate recess (11), 
characterized in that
 
the fastening element comprises a bolt (20) which is received by a spacer sleeve (21) 

inserted into a bush (22) of easily deformable material, the internal diameter of which 
corresponds to the external diameter of the spacer sleeve (21) and the external diameter 

of which corresponds to the diameter (
D
) of the larger circular boundary edge (12) at the 
end of the elongate recess (11),
 
or the fastening element is constructed in the form of a rivet (37) with a central bore (38), 

by way of which the shank of the rivet (37) can be widened during the riveting, and the 
elongate recess (11) receives a deformation element (31) which comprises an elongate 

base part (32) and an offset (33) which is formed integrally therewith and which is provided 
on an end portion of the base part (32). 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the end-face contours 
(34) of the offset (33) of the deformation element (31) extend in a curve and/or in a 

wedge-shape. 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the height (
H
) of 
the offset (33) corresponds approximately to the wall thickness of the material in which 

the elongate hole (11) is formed. 
A safety steering system according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in tha
t the 
offset (33) of the deformation element (31) rests with one end face thereof on one boundary  

 
contour (13) at the end of the elongate hole (11), and the length of the offset (33) is 

only approximately half as long as the length of the elongate hole (11). 
A safety steering system according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the deformation 
element (31) rests with its end face (35) remote from its offset (33) on the rivet (37), 

wherein the base part (32) of the said deformation element (31) is situated to the side of 
the plane of the elongate hole (11). 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the deformation 
element (31) and the bush (22) are produced from plastics material. 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the bush (22) produced 
from easily deformable material has a laterally projecting collar (23) which is 

interposed between the part (7) of the steering column (2) provided with the elongate 
recess (11) and the vehicle body or a connexion member connected thereto. 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the circular boundary 
edge (12) with the enlarged diameter (
D
) passes into the straight boundary edges 
(14) by way of a step-like offset (15). 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the straight boundary 
edges (14) extend in a converging manner towards the steering-wheel end of the 

elongate recess (11). 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the planes of the 
elongate recess (11) are arranged vertically upright. 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

means (20, 37) received by the elongate recess (11) is traversed by an arm (19) of an 

angle plate (16), the other arm (17) of which is secured to the vehicle body. 
A safety steering system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 receiving openings 
(27) for pin-like fastening elements are provided in flanges (26) which project laterally
