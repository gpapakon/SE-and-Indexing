<DESCRIPTION>
 CATALYSTS BOUND WITH LOW ACIDITY REFRACTORY OXIDE The invention relates to a method for preparing mechanically stable molecular sieve catalyst compositions possessing a refractory oxide binder of low acidity, e.g., a titania, zirconia and/or silica binder. The catalysts of the invention possess significant physical strength and will resist abrasion and fracture during loading and transit. These catalysts easily withstand loads in a catalyst bed due to fluid pressure drop and weight of superimposed catalyst. They also have superior interior cohesion allowing for calcination and regeneration without catalyst particle breakup.Molecular sieves for use as catalyst components herein include zeolites, aluminophosphates, silicoaluminophosphates, layered and pillared-layered materials and other catalytically active crystalline materials.The term "zeolite" as used herein designates the class of porous crystalline silicates, which contain silicon and oxygen atoms as major components. Other framework components can be present in usually less than about 14 mole %, and often less than about 4%. These components include aluminum, gallium, iron, boron, etc. , and combinations thereof. The crystalline aluminosilicates constitute an especially well known type of zeolite.It is well known that extrusion is one way of obtaining a molecular sieve-containing material which has a high degree of strength for various applications, both catalytic and noncatalytic. Some molecular sieves, eÂ»g., aluminosilicate zeolites, have long been used as catalysts for a wide variety of organic conversion processes. In general, the molecular sieve is incorporated with a matrix, or binder, material in order to impart mechanical stability hereto. The most commonly used matrix materials have included alumina 

and/or clays since these materials are fairly easy to extrude and provide extrudates of good physical strength for many applications.It has come to be recognized that low acidity refractory oxides, such as titania, zirconia and silica, are desirable matrix materials and that they possess advantages over alumina for some catalytic reactions. In this connection, U.S. Patent No. 4,013,732 specifically discloses ZSM-5 with a silica matrix and U.S. Patent Nos. 3,843,741 and 3,702,886 broadly disclose the use of ZSM-5 with a silica matrix.U.S. Patent No. 4,582,815 describes a method for preparing silica-rich solids said to possess improved crush strength compared to that of known silica-bound materials. The method comprises mixing silica-rich
