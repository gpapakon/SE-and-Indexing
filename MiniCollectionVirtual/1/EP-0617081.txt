<ABSTRACT>
Polyethylene compositions which can be processed by injection moulding contain from 40 to 99 % by weight of a polyethylene having an intrinsic viscosity of from 1,000 to 5,000 ml/g and from 60 to 1 % by weight of a polyethylene having an intrinsic viscosity of from 100 to 700 ml/g. The molecular weight distribution of each of the polyethylene components is less than 9. The intrinsic viscosity of the compositions is at least 1,500 ml/g.

<CLAIMS>
A polyethylene composition for processing by injection 
molding which comprises, in each case based on 

the composition, 40 to 99% by weight of a first 
polyethylene having a limiting viscosity number of 

1000 to 5000 ml/g and 60 to 1% by weight of a second 
polyethylene having a limiting viscosity number of 

100 to 700 ml/g, the molecular weight distribution 
of each of the polyethylene components being less 

than 9 and the limiting viscosity number of the 
composition being at least 1000 ml/g. 
A polyethylene composition as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the limiting viscosity number of the first 

polyethylene is 3000 to 4000 ml/g. 
A polyethylene composition as claimed in claim 1 or 
2, wherein the limiting viscosity number of the 

second polyethylene is 200 to 500. 
A polyethylene composition as claimed in one or more 
of claims 1 to 3, wherein the first and the second 

polyethylene have a molecular weight distribution of 
4 to 8. 
A polyethylene composition as claimed in one or more 
of claims 1 to 4, wherein the content of the first 

polyethylene having a limiting viscosity number of 
1000 to 5000 ml/g is 60 to 80% by weight and the 

content of the second polyethylene having a limiting 
viscosity number of 100 to 700 ml/g is 40 to 20% by 

weight, in each case based on the composition. 
A polyethylene composition as claimed in one or more 
of claims 1 to 5, wherein the limiting viscosity 

number of the composition is greater than 1500 ml/g.
