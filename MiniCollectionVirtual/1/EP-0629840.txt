<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a navigation system for
vehicle, and more particularly to a navigation system capable
of providing route display to destination and vocal guide
message for driving.There is a stand-alone type navigation system known
as a position measuring device used in vehicles such as
automobile, airplane or ship. Stand-alone type navigation
system detects two-dimensional displacement (vector) from
azimuth data obtained by azimuth sensor and velocity data
obtained by velocity sensor, and adds the two-dimensional
displacement to data of reference point to calculate current
position of vehicle. In a case of automobile, predetermined
number of pulses are generated for every rotation of drive
shaft of the automobile, and travel distance between the
reference point and current position is calculated on the basis
of the total number of pulses thus generated. Then, exact
travel distance is obtained by multiplying the travel distance
by a distance correction coefficient.As a position measuring device utilizing space 
satellites, GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation system
has been developed. GPS navigation system generally receives
electric waves from more than three GPS satellites, and
calculates pseudo distance data including offset time between
each of GPS satellites and electric wave receiving point and
current position data of electric wave receiving point on the
basis of the position data of the GPS satellites. Then, the
GPS navigation system reads out map data around the calculated
current position, using information processor unit, from a
storage unit, stores the read out data, produces display data
from stored map data and the current position data, and
displays it. From the displayed information, driver using the
system can recognize current position of the vehicle with
relation to map information.Among navigation systems of these kind, it has been
developed a system which represents visual guide marks
instructing turning corner left or right at certain transit
points such as crossings on the way from a start point to a
destination point. The navigation system calculates transit
points from route data preset by user or calculated
automatically by the system on the basis of data of start point
and destination point defined by user. As described, an
essential object of navigation system is to give driving 
information, such as current position or travel direction, to
user to assist his driving. Namely, it is used and operated
during drive of user, and therefore the system must not
