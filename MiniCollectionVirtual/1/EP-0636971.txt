<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for operating a processor-controlled machine to produce a 
composite view of an original, or first, image by combining the functions of multiple viewing 

operations and using the model data structure from which the first image was produced 
(called the "FIMDS".) A first viewing operation region (1VOR) (20) in a first viewing position in 

the display area (180) of the display device has displayed in the 1VOR (20) a second image 
produced according to a first viewing operation (VO1), associated with the 1VOR, that maps 

the FIMDS to image definition data defining the second image. Request signal data is received 
from a signal source to present a second viewing operation region (2VOR) (40) in the display 

area (180) coextensive with at least a portion of the 1VOR (20), forming a composite viewing 
operation region in the overlapping region. The 2VOR (40) has a second viewing operation 

(VO2) associated with it for mapping an input model data structure, typically but not 

necessarily the FIMDS, to image definition data defining a second image for display in the 
2VOR (2VOR-SI), providing an alternate view of the FIMDS that is different from that provided 

by the VO1 associated with the 1VOR. In response to the request signal data, a composite 
viewing operation, composed from the functions of the VO1 and the VO2, maps the FIMDS to 

image definition data defining a composite image for display in the composite viewing 
operation region substantially at the same time as the first image is being displayed in the 

display area. This gives the perception to the machine user of applying composed viewing 
operations to information presented in the original image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of operating a processor-controlled
machine having a display for displaying images, and to a processor-controlled
machine operated according to the method. More particularly, the present invention relates to
producing a composite second image for display in the spatial context of a first displayed image
by operating on the model data structure from which the first displayed image was produced,
and using two or more displayed viewing operation regions for identifying the relevant
portions of the image for which the composite second image is to be produced.A frequent and powerful use of a processor-controlled machine such as a computer is
the presentation of information in the form of images on a display device connected to the
machine. An image, which may include characters, words, and text as well as other display
features such as graphics, is produced in a display area of the display device directly from an
image definition data structure defining the image; the image definition data structure is
typically stored in a memory area of the machine. One type of image format known as a raster
image is composed of individual image locations commonly referred to as "pixels". The images
discussed herein may be either static (having the appearance to a system operator or user of
not moving), or animated, as, for example, in the case of a digital video image.An image definition data structure alone carries relatively limited data about the
information content of the image the data represent. However, for many images, the image
definition data structure is itself generated from another data structure which contains
information or data capable of being understood by a human or by a software operation such
as an application program which is executed by the machine's processor. Such a data structure
will be referred to herein as the "information model data structure" or the "model data
structure", and is to be distinguished from the image definition data structure. Examples of
information model data structures include scene description models used by rendering
operations to produce graphics images such as photorealistic scenes; and document models
used by a word processing or other document manipulation application which contains the
text, formatting instructions, and other data needed for producing a formatted document.In some systems providing user access to the model data structure, a user may be able
to access, and perhaps affect or manipulate, data and
