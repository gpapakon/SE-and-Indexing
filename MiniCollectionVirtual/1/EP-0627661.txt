<ABSTRACT>
In a coating apparatus where a coating composition is 
supplied from the lateral side of a manifold, a linear or 

curved taper along the width of the coating apparatus is given 
to the length a slit in the direction of flowing-out of the 

coating composition, so that the slit length is shorter in the 
counter-supply side than in the supply side of the manifold. 

The coating apparatus can make the distribution of the quantity 
of coating uniform in the case where the width of coating is 

large, or in the case where the quantity of flow per unit width 
in an individual layer is large.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
coating a continuously moving web having the form of a beltlike
carrier with various liquid coating compositions, for use
in the production of a photographic light-sensitive film, a
photographic paper, a magnetic recording tape, an adhesive
tape, information recording paper such as a pressure sensitive
paper, a thermo-sensitive paper or the like, a light-sensitive
printing plate, and so on. 
In particular, the present invention relates to a coating die block in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1.Such a coating die block is known from EP-A-0 435 351. The present invention further
relates to a method of performing machining on a block
constituting the coating apparatus.A basic structure of an apparatus according to a slide
bead system for coating a plurality of layers at the same time
with several liquid compositions is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 2,761,791. Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a typical coating
die used in this field, particularly for coating a web with
photographic light-sensitive materials.A coating composition supplied from a liquid inlet 5 is
spread widthwise in a manifold 1 (a portion where the coating
composition is spread widthwise in the coating die). Then a
layer of the coating composition is formed by a slit 2 (a
portion which is on the downstream side of the manifold and
where a layer of the coating composition is formed). The
formed layer of the coating composition flows on an inclined 
slide surface 9 and is applied on a web 8 supported by a backup
roller 7. In this apparatus it is very important to use a
coating die which can give an uniform distribution of the
coating quantity.If the speed of coating is increased or the width of
coating is expanded in order to increase the quantity of
production, it is inevitable that the quantity of supplied
liquid is increased. Accordingly the dynamic pressure of
liquid put into the manifold 1 from the liquid inlet 5 is so
increased as to give an influence to a flow in the slit.
Particularly near the liquid inlet 5, the dynamic pressure
becomes so high that the distribution of coating quantity tends
to be deteriorated, i.e. the uniformity of the liquid layer is
disturbed. This deterioration is conspicuous in the case where
the quantity of flow of a coating composition exceeds 0.5
cc/cmÂ·s per unit width.The influence of the dynamic pressure may be reduced if
the clearance of the slit 2 is made narrow to increase the
pressure drop. In this case, however, if the mechanical
accuracy of the

<CLAIMS>
A coating die block having a manifold (1) for widthwise spreading a coating
composition, and a slit (2) for making said coating composition flow out while

forming a layer of said coating composition all over the width of said manifold to
thereby coat a continuously moving web with said coating composition flowed

from said slit, wherein:

a liquid inlet for said coating composition is disposed on a lateral side of said
manifold; and
the length of said slit (2) in the direction of flowing-out of said coating composition
is made gradually shorter from said liquid inlet side (A) of said manifold (1) toward

the side (B) opposite to said liquid inlet side
characterized in that

said manifold (1) and said slit (2) share a common upward convex curved
boundary so as to define a substantially tapered configuration of said slit (3) in the

lateral direction.
A method for machining the boundary of a coating die block according to claim 1
comprising the steps:


bending and fixing a block (6) in a plane including a surface of said slit (Figure 4),
or in a plane perpendicular to said surface of said slit (Figure 3); and
grinding the boundary surface of said manifold (1) contacting said slit (2) with a
linearly reciprocating machining means, so that the length of said surface of said 

slit in the direction of flowing-out of said coating composition is formed to have a
curved shape along the width of said coating apparatus.
