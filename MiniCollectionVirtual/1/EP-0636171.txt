<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of lysing malignant cells, which comprises contacting the malignant cells with an antibody which specifically reacts with an epitope present on the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and/or beta subunit fragment, under conditions such that the malignant cells lyse. This invention further provides a method of quantitatively measuring malignant cells or a method of obtaining an enriched population of malignant cells, which comprises contacting live malignant cells to be measured or contacting a population of cells comprising live malignant cells with an antibody directed to an epitope of human chorionic gonadotropin, its subunits and/or subunit fragments, under conditions such that the antibody is capable of forming a complex with the epitope if present on the cell surface, and detecting the presence of any complex formed using fluorescence activated cell sorting technology, the presence of such complex on the surface of the cells indicating that the cells are malignant, and isolating the cells which form a complex with the antibody.

<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this application various publications are
referenced by Arabic numerals. Full citations for these
references may be found at the end of the specification
immediately preceding the claims.The hormone of pregnancy, human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG), is a dimeric sialoglycoprotein composed of two
noncovalently linked dissimilar subunits known as α and
β. The single α-subunit (hCGα) gene is located in
chromosome 6 (1-3). A cluster of at least six genes (4,
5) located in chromosome 19 (3) encode individually for
the β subunit (hCGβ). Within species, hCGα is identical
to the α-subunit of the three other members that
constitute the family of glycoprotein hormones arising
from the anterior pituitary, that is lutropin,
follitropin and thyrotropin. The unique β-subunits
determine the biological specificity for each one of
these hormones (6). Under normal nonpregnant conditions,
only sperm cells in male humans (7, 8) and cells from
some fetal tissues (9) synthesize the subunits de novo. Expression of the subunits, as well as translatable
levels of hCGβ mRNA, have been detected early after
fertilization (10-13).The dimer, which is the intact or whole compound (hCG-holo),
is the only bioactive molecule. Its formation
depends not only on the different factors regulating the
expression of the α-subunit and β-subunit genes (14, 15)
but also on the synthesis of competent subunits (16-19).
Therefore, in cells that synthesize hCG, free subunits
can also be found. Another important chemical
characteristic of these highly glycosylated proteins (the
carbohydrate component of intact hCG comprises
approximately one third of its 37 KD molecular weight) is
their high degree of sialylation. Thus, hCGβ has up to
12 sialic acid residues, 8 of them in the carboxy
terminal peptide (CTP) (residues 111 to 145), and hCGα
has 4, resulting in molecules having a high negative
charge.In addition, hCG-holo and its subunits are present in the
cell in two pools, a secretory pool (hydrophilic, also
known as the soluble pool) and a membrane pool, also
described as the insoluble pool. In the latter pool, the
dimer and its subunits become an intrinsic part of the
cell membrane and cannot be extracted unless the
membranes are destroyed by sonication and treated with
detergents to solubilize the material--hence the name
insoluble pool (20).During the last 5 years, several pieces of information
pertaining to the chemistry and biology of hCG have been
published. The first was the elucidation of the structure
of the urinary hCGβ core
