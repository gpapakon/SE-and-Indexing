<ABSTRACT>
Pelleting of kieserite comprises: (a) rolling a mixt. (which is pre-moistened or is moistened during the rolling process) of (i) kieserite with an av. particle size of 0.3-0.5 mm, (ii) at least 20% of very fine ground kieserite with an av. particle size of 0.02-0.04 mm, and (iii) recovered material from recycled defective grains, on a granulation plate in the presence of granulation auxiliaries; (b) sieving; (c) taking out the saleable grain fraction, and recycling defective grains (opt. after comminution). The granulation auxiliary is 0.7-3.0% (based on Hs amt. of components (i) and (ii) only) alkali hydroxide in the form of a soln. The resulting total mixt. is jetted onto the granulation plate with magnesium sulphate. The pellets which are removed from the plate are cooled to 30 oC and subjected to a maturation process.

<CLAIMS>
A process for granulating kieserite by rolling a wetted 
mixture of kieserite, comprising in initially dry form relatively 

coarse kieserite of an average grain size of 0.3 to 0.5 mm and 
kieserite which is ground dust-fine of an average grain size of 0.02 to 

0.04 mm, wherein the ground proportion is at least 20%, and returned 
defective grain on a granulating plate with the addition of granulating 

additives, sieving out and discharging the saleable grain fraction 
obtained and returning the defective grain obtained into the 

granulating procedure, characterised in that firstly an amount of 0.7 
to 3.0% of alkali hydroxide in the form of an agueous solution is added 

to the charge material, with respect to the amount of fresh material, 
and then the entire mixture is sprayed on the granulating plate with an 

aqueous magnesium sulphate solution, wherein the amount of MgSO
4
 is 1 
to 2%, with respect to the amount of fresh material, and before the 

sieving-out operation the shaped green pellets are cooled to at least 
30Â°C and subjected to a maturing procedure. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that sodium 
hydroxide solution is used as the alkali hydroxide solution. 
A process according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in that 
the alkali hydroxide solution is intermixed in a mixer with the 

kieserite mixture before being delivered on to the granulating plate. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
aqueous magnesium sulphate solution has a concentration of 20 - 35% of 

magnesium sulphate. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the aqueous alkali hydroxide solution has a concentration of at 

least 20% of alkali hydroxide.  
 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that the added partial amount of water in the form of alkali hydroxide 

solution is 1 to 2% with respect to the amount of fresh material and 
the added partial amount of water in the form of magnesium sulphate 

solution is 3 to 5% with respect to the amount of fresh material. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
maturing step and the hardening step are effected on maturing belts 

with a residence time of 10 to 40 minutes.
