<ABSTRACT>
A fading device (12) which is connected to the output (11.2) and to the input (11.1) of a delay line (11) contained in the transmission path (9) is connected into the transmission path (9) of an equaliser arrangement (8) for a signal (Se) which exhibits signal discontinuities. In addition, the input of the transmission path (9) is connected to a control arrangement (14) for detecting signal discontinuities, which, when a signal discontinuity is detected, generates a control signal S14 which oscillates about a zero line and exhibits a zero crossing and which controls the fading device in such a manner that an associated signal edge occurring at the time of the signal discontinuity is transmitted with a steep slope. Outside the detection of a signal edge, both a component of the undelayed colour signal and a component of the delayed colour signal is transmitted to the signal output (12.3) of the fading device (12).

signal-change detector (18) is connected, and a 
subtracter (19), whose signal inputs (19.1, 19.2) 

are each connected to a signal output of a 
signal-change detector (17, 18), for generating a 

control signal (S14) which marks the instant of a 
signal change (3) by a passage through zero (22)
