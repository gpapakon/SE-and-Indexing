<ABSTRACT>
The gate electrode of a polysilicon gate MOS transistor (100)--the 
transistor having either a thin film polysilicon substrate (10) or a bulk 

monocrystalline substrate--has a pair of contiguous regions (32.1, 32.3): a heavily 
doped gate electrode region near the source (11), and a lightly doped gate electrode 

region near the drain (13). The gate electrode region near the drain is thus doped 
significantly more lightly, in order to reduce electric fields in the portion of the 

channel region that is located in the neighborhood of the drain (and hence reduce 
field induced leakage currents) when voltages are applied to turn transistor OFF. At 

the same time, sufficient impurity doping is introduced into the gate electrode region 
near the source in order to enable the transistor to turn ON when other suitable 

voltages are applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor devices and more particularly to 
metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) transistor structures, especially those in which 
the insulator is an oxide and hence the transistors have MOS structures. An MIS transistor structure is useful, for example, as a load device in an 
inverter or in a static random access memory (SRAM) cell, the latter comprising a 
pair of cross-connected inverters. Such an MIS structure can be built on a 
monocrystalline bulk substrate ("bulk" transistor), or it can be built in a 
polycrystalline semiconductor film located on a dielectric substrate such as glass or 
quartz ("thin film" transistor or TFT). An array of MIS transistors, especially TFTs, 
is also useful as access (control) transistors to an array of light emitting areas such as 
liquid crystal pixels. A serious problem that arises during circuit operation of MIS transistors, 
particularly those MIS transistors that are implemented in polycrystalline silicon, 
stems from high electric fields in the neighborhood of the drain region. These high 
electric fields are undesirable in the case of polycrystalline thin film transistors 
because the fields cause undesirably high OFF currents by the mechanism of field 
emission via crystal grain boundary trapping states. In the case of monocrystalline 
bulk transistors, these high electric fields generate undesirable hot carriers which 
cause premature transistor failure. A commonly used remedy for alleviating the 
effects of high field near the drain is to reduce the maximum field by removing the 
effective edge of the drain electrode from under the gate, i.e., by separating the edge 
of the gate and the effective edge of the drain by a setback distance. These 
techniques are known under the names "lightly doped drain" (for bulk transistors) 
and "drain offset" (for TFTs). A disadvantage of these techniques is in an unwanted 
decrease of the source-drain current in the ON state of the transistor, owing to the 
added series resistance introduced by the lightly doped drain or the drain offset, 
respectively. The invention is defined in claim 1. Embodiments of the invention are 
given in the dependent claims.  FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional elevational diagram of a transistor structure, 
together with electric circuit connections, in accordance with a specific embodiment 
of the invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a MIS thin-film transistor structure 100 has a source 
electrode 31 coupled to a voltage source VSOURCE. typically equal to +3.3 volt, and

interface with the insulator extending from the edge of the source region to the edge 

of the drain region, and

first gate electrode region goes into an electrically conductive state and the second 
gate electrode region remains in a state of depletion, while the conducting channel is 

extinguished and the electric field in the semiconductor, underlying the second gate

virtue of a depletion of the second gate electrode region.
