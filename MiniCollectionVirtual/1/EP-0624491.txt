<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle or container (2) having a fixed deck (10) 
and a moveable secondary deck is described. The moveable 

secondary deck is formed from two or more independently 
moveable secondary deck sections (12). A drive system is 

provided for the secondary deck which comprises drive means 
(14) for raising/lowering the sections (12) on supply of 

power thereto, power supply means (50) carried on the 
vehicle or container body and connection means (24, 26, 28, 

48) for transferal of power from the power supply means 
(50) to the drive means (14). The drive means may comprise 

a drive member (14) for each section (12), the connection 
means being arranged such that each drive member (14) is 

selectively connectable to the power supply means (50). A 
single power supply means (50) carried outside the load 

space may thus be employed selectively to power multiple 
drive members (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicles such as trailers 
semi-trailers lorries and vans and to containers, all for 
transporting goods. Transport vehicles and containers are known in which, 
in addition to the fixed load deck, a secondary moveable 
deck is provided. The provision of a secondary moveable 
deck allows division of the load space into two regions 
with reduction of the load height in each region. This 
increases loading safety and reduces the weight carried by 
each deck and by bottom loaded goods from the goods 
thereabove. In one known arrangement, the secondary deck is raised 
and lowered by hydraulic rams which act directly thereon. 
This is a costly arrangement and the rams reduce the 
available load space. Further the rams have to be capable 
of extending the full height of the vehicle or container to 
allow storage of the secondary deck adjacent the roof. U.S. Patent 4642018 describes a transport vehicle with 
multiple moveable secondary deck sections. These can be 
vertically raised and then moved into either a deck-forming 
position, where they are located approximately mid-way 
between the vehicle floor and its roof, and a stowage 
position where they are located parallel and close adjacent 
to the vehicle roof. French Patent Application 2447297 discloses a vehicle 
with three moveable secondary decks, one of which is driven 
upwards and serves to drive the others. The driven deck 
carries pinions which engage with toothed racks secured to 
the walls of the vehicle body.  A transport vehicle is also known in which, as in U.S. 
Patent 4642018, the secondary deck is divided into a number 
of sections, but in this case, each is independently 
moveable. A similar drive to that disclosed in French 
Patent Application 2447297 is employed, each secondary deck 
section being provided with drive chains fixed to the walls 
of the transport vehicle or container adjacent the deck 
section. In use, an electric motor is moved to a deck 
section to be raised or lowered and connected to a gear box 
in the section which transmits the drive to a sprocket 
arrangement. Drive cogs move along the vertical chains to 
achieve the desired section position. The arrangement is 
somewhat complicated, costly and prone to failure. A 
plurality of chains and supports therefor has to be 
provided for each section. These reduce the load space and 
can interfere with loading. Further the need to transport 
the motor to the section to be moved makes loading of the 
vehicle or container time inefficient and laborious.

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle or container (2) having a fixed deck 
(10), a moveable secondary deck including two or more 

independently moveable secondary deck sections (12) and a 
drive system for the secondary deck comprising drive means 

(14) for raising/lowering the sections (12) on supply of 
power thereto, power supply means (50) carried on the 

vehicle or container body and connection means (24, 26, 28, 
48) for transferal of power from the power supply means to 

the drive means. 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the drive means comprises a drive member (14) for 

each section (12), the connection means (24, 26, 28, 48) 
being arranged such that each drive member (14) is 

selectively connectible to the power supply means (50). 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 2, 
wherein the connection means comprises a selector device 

(48) operatively connected between the power supply means 
(50) and the drive members (14) for selectively connecting 

the power supply means (50) to one of the drive members 
(14) and control means (26, 28) for the selector device 

(48) for causing selective connection of the power supply 
means (50) to a given, specific, drive member (14). 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 3, 
 

wherein the connection means includes a plurality of 
connection members (49), each extending between the 

selector device (48) and a receiver (24) associated with 
each section (12), the control means (26, 28) being 

arranged to provide a signal at a receiver (24) to cause 
power supply to the drive member (14) of the associated 

section (12). 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 4, 
wherein each receiver comprises a socket (24) and the 

control means comprises a portable pendant controller (26) 
with a plug (28) engageable in the socket (24) to thereby 

produce the control signal. 
A vehicle or container as claimed in any one of 
Claims 2 to 5, wherein the drive members comprise hydraulic 

piston and cylinder devices (14). 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 6, 
wherein the power supply means (50) comprises a motor 

driving a hydraulic pump. 
A vehicle or container as claimed in either 
Claim 6 or 7 when dependent on any one of Claims 3 to 5, 

wherein the selector device comprises a multiple-way 
control valve (48). 
A vehicle or container as claimed in any 
 

preceding Claim, wherein the drive system includes drive 
cables (16) moveable around pulleys (20, 22, 40, 42, 46) to 

raise/lower the sections (12) on supply of power to the 
drive means. 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 9, 
wherein the drive means (14) cause relative movement 

between two banks of pulleys (40, 42) to thereby cause 
movement of a pair of drive cables (16) which are connected 

to a secondary deck section (12) thereby to raise/lower the 
section (12). 
A vehicle or container as claimed in Claim 10, 

wherein one pulley bank (40) is fixed and the other pulley 
bank (42) is moveable.
