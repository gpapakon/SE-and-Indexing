<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus of the type comprising a system for supporting a half carcass (side) suspended from the conveyor of a slaughterhouse production line, capable of orientating the half-carcass about its point of suspension, a system for taking photographs which is located on one side of the conveyor, a luminous or contrasting background situated opposite the photograph-taking system, on the other side of the conveyor, a system for processing the photographs and a control system. According to the invention, the support system for each half-carcass comprises a vertical post (3) whose axis passes through the axis of the hook of the conveyor, this post being driven in rotation by a geared motor unit (12) and being associated with a mechanism for indexing its angular position, the post bearing, diametrally opposed, two series of stop pieces (17) for a half carcass, each stop piece including a support (18) fixed to the post (3) and used for fitting a horizontal bar (19) forming the actual stop piece. Application to the equipment of a slaughterhouse production line.

A device for classifying carcasses of adult cattle, 
calves, pigs or sheep, of the type comprising a system for 

supporting a half-carcass suspended on the conveyor of an 
abattoir conveyor line, capable of orienting the half-carcass 

about its point of suspension, a photographic 
system disposed on one side of the conveyor, a bright or 

contrasting background (20) situated opposite the 
photographic system on the other side of the conveyor, a 

photographic processing system and a control system, 
characterised in that the system supporting each half-carcass 

comprises a vertical column (3), the axis of which 
passes through the axis of the conveyor hook (2), said 

column (3) being driven in rotation by a geared motor (12) 
and associated with a mechanism (16) for indexing its 

angular position and carrying, in diametrically opposed 
positions, two series of support abutments (17) for a half-carcass, 

each abutment comprising a support (18) fixed on 
the column (3) and serving in the mounting of a horizontal 

bar (19) forming the abutment proper. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the supports (18) of the abutments (17) situated on 

the same side of the column (3) are of variable thickness, 
the highest abutment (17) being situated closer to the 

column (3) than the lowest abutment (17), these different 
abutments defining a plane inclined from top to bottom, 

from the column (3) in an outward direction therefrom. 
A device according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the abutment supports (18) are 

mounted so as to be vertically adjustable on the column 
(3). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that at least certain of the bars (19) 

forming abutments consist of two sections articulated about 
a vertical axis half-way along the bar and associated with 

a motorising system enabling them to pivot between a  
 

position in which the bar is straight and a position in 
which the bar forms a V. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the assembly comprising the vertical 

column (3) and its drive system (12-15) is mounted on a 
frame (5) fixed movably to a support structure (6) fixed to 

the ground. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it comprises a background (20) 

consisting of a light-coloured panel lit by lamps (22) 
mounted behind screens disposed along the panel. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it comprises a background (20) 

consisting of a dark-coloured panel lit from outside by 
lamps (23) situated on the same side as the photographic 

cameras. 
A device according to either one of claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in that the panel (20) forming the background 

consists of a continuous surface. 
A device according to either one of claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in that the panel forming the background 

consists of a plurality of parallel superposed surfaces 
inclined with respect to t
he vertical and optionally 
positioned at an angle with respect to the abattoir 

conveyor line, so that they are disposed as orthogonally as 
possible with respect to the cameras. 
A device according to any one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that the panel (20) comprises an 

optionally closable opening (21) designed to allow the 
passage of a system for washing the abutments (17). 
A device according to claim 10, characterised in 
that it comprises a system for washing the abutments (17) 

comprising the same number of washing heads (25) as there 
are abutments (17) on one side of the column, said heads 

being mounted in vertically offset arrangement on a single 
support (24) which is itself displaceable transversely with 

respect to the conveyor so that each head (25) moves along  
 

an abutment (17) situated, with respect to the column, on 
the opposite side from the half-carcass arrival side, each 

head (25) being equipped with three nozzles (28, 29, 30) 
which, offset axially and serving respectively to supply 

hot water, steam and air, are accommodated inside a 
longitudinally slit tubular casing (27) designed to engage 

with an abutment during cleaning thereof. 
A device according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the hot water is at a temperature of from 50°C to 90°C 

under 3 bar of pressure, the steam is at 140°C under 3 bar

A device according to either one of claims 11 and 
12, characterised in that the control box (32) for 

controlling supply of the nozzles (28, 29) supplies the 
steam nozzle (29), the hot water nozzle (28) and optionally 

the air nozzle (30) during the "outward" movement of each 
head and the hot water nozzle (28), the steam nozzle (29)

thereof. 
A device according to any one of claims 11 to 13, 
characterised in that the washing head support (24) is

air jack. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the photographic cameras (C1, C2, D1, 

D2, E1, E2) are arranged inside a box (35) comprising a 
structure (36) serving in the mounting of camera supports 

(37), this box being equipped with a door (38) provided

containing a heating system (40) and optionally an air-conditioning 
unit (42). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 15,
