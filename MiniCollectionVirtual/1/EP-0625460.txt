<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to railway track circuits. An 
active track circuit termination unit 4 is connected to 

the rails and, by means of transmitter unit 4a, transmits 
signals into the rails to terminate track circuits A,B. 

The transmitter unit also transmit data signals, for 
example track circuit signals, into the track circuits. 

This system allows greater flexibility than do prior 
passive track circuit termination systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to railway track circuits. Railway track circuits are used to detect the presence 
and/or position of railway vehicles in a length of 
railway track. In a typical track circuit system, the 
track is divided into several track circuit sections, in 
each of which at one location a transmitter of electrical 
signals is coupled with the rails and at another location 
a receiver is coupled with the rails. When a railway 
vehicle is in the track circuit section of track it 
electrically connects the rails of the circuit to each 
other and this is detected by the receiver as a change in 
the signal received from the transmitter. Where the railway tracks are not jointless, adjacent 
track circuit sections may be separated merely by 
insulative breaks in the rails. In jointless railways, 
track circuit sections are conventionally separated by 
providing, at the boundaries between track circuit 
sections, passive connections across the rails which 
present low impedances to signals of the frequency at 
which the track circuit operates. These prevent such 
signals propagating past the connections, from one track 
circuit section to another. The passive connections may 
comprise either a shorting bar which connects the rails 
directly together or an electrical filter having a 
suitable impedance. Usually the shorting bar arrangement 
is resonated by the addition of a capacitor some distance 
from the bar in order to increase the rail-to-rail 
voltage because a high voltage is necessary to break down 
the oxide film which is present between the train's 
wheels and the rails. Where the railway vehicles are electrically powered, the 
vehicles' traction power (which may be supplied to the 
vehicles by, for example, a catenary wire over the 
tracks) may be returned to the substation via the rails.  
 In this case it is necessary to connect the rails so as 
to balance the return traction current between them. 
Where the rails are connected by shorting bars as part of 
a track circuit system these can also serve as connectors 
in the traction circuit. However, where the rails are 
connected by electrical filters, which are tuned to 
present a low impedance at the frequency at which the 
track circuit system operates, secondary ("impedance 
bond") connectors which present a low impedance at the 
frequency of the traction circuit and a high impedance at 
track circuit frequencies are needed. Both of these 
systems of track circuit connection have disadvantages.
