<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for observing or photographing corneal cells (such as 
cornea endothelium and epithelium) provides for optical axis alignment 

and focussing of an imaging system (3). The apparatus is capable of 
assessing the position of the area to be photographed and of measuring 

corneal thickness from the endothelium image so produced. 
A whole imaging system (3) which comprises:-
 

   an indicator projecting means (23),
 

   an eye-front observation optical system (6),
 

   an illuminating system (11) for obliquely illuminating the eyeball 
surface (2) through a slit (16),

 
   an optical system (19) for forming an enlarged image of the 

subject-part by the TV camera (8),
 

and
 

   a "corneal cell focussing" photo-detector (30). 
The corneal cell focussing photo-detector (30) is automatically moved 
in X- and Y- directions with respect to the optical axis (4), so that 

the light spot (40) on a monitor screen (33) is brought to a specified 
position on the screen. When the light spot (40) is brought to this 

specified position, the eye-front image is recorded and, thereafter, the 
imaging system (3) is started and the system (3) moves forward so as to 

track the light spot (40) towards the subject's eye (1). By means of the 
photo-detector (30), an enlarged image of the corneal cells is recorded 

and displayed simultaneously with the eye-front image on which the light 
spot (40) is positioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and
apparatus for obtaining images of a cornea, by which
enlarged images of cornea cells such as cornea endothelium
cells or cornea epithelium cells of an eyeball of a subject
can be observed or photographed.For seeing influences of contact lenses or for
medical examination and treatment before and after an
operation of cataract, it is necessary to observe the state
of cornea endothelium cells. Therefore, for observation or
photographing of cornea endothelium cells of an eyeball of
a subject with their enlarged images, there have
conventionally been used apparatus in which with an
objective lens of a microscope of non-contact type or
contact type with respect to the eyeball surface of the
subject, slit illuminating light is applied toward an
observation part obliquely of the eye axis and separated
into reflected light from the cornea surface and image rays
of light of endothelium cells so that an image of the
cornea endothelium cells of the subject part are imaged by 
a TV camera or the like. Meanwhile, there has been
proposed an ophthalmological apparatus equipped with a so-called
alignment device for aligning the imaging center
axis of the apparatus with the eye axis to make the TV
camera focused on the subject part, such as disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. HEI 2-283352.In these conventional apparatus, the focusing on
the cornea endothelium has been accomplished in the
following way. That is, the eye axis of the subject is
aligned with the optical axis of the microscope (optical-axis
adjustment) by manually moving a microscope frame, on
which a TV camera is mounted, up and down or right and left
with the use of an operation member such as a joy stick so
that the alignment indicator light is located at the center
of the pupil of the eye on a monitor screen. In this
state, the frame, which is the main body, is moved back and
forth also manually, so that the focusing is accomplished.
As a result, substantial labors and skills have been
required for the focusing on the cornea endothelium cells
of the subject part. Further, in making observation or
photographing with the above apparatus, there have been
demands for observing or photographing not only the center
part but also various sites of the cornea with their
enlarged images, depending on what is examined in the
medical treatment. However, only enlarged images of 
observation or photographing could hardly make it known
which site of the cornea is shown.Furthermore, these apparatus, although
