<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved expendable lining for 
a molten metal handling vessel and a method of lining the vessel. 
An expendable lining is sprayed inside the vessel and 
dried and an impregnant coating of greater refractoriness than the 

expendable lining is applied to the dried expendable lining whereby its 
permeability is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the lining of molten metal
handling vessels, e.g. a ladle or a tundish. For convenience the
invention will be described with specific reference to tundishes.In the continuous casting of metals, e.g. steel, molten
metal is cast into a continuous casting mould via an intermediate
vessel which acts as a constant head reservoir, this intermediate
vessel being known as a tundish. The tundish has a metal floor and
walls and one or more outlet nozzles set in the floor. To protect the
metal floor and walls of the tundish from the effects of the molten
metal it is usual to line the interior of the tundish with a relatively
permanent lining, often made of bricks, or in the form of a cast
monolithic lining. The tundish may additionally be provided with an
inner expendable lining of refractory heat-insulating material.Expendable inner linings have to meet various distinct
requirements and certain of these conflict to a greater or lesser extent.
In particular, while it is desirable for the expendable lining to be
highly heat-insulating, it is also desirable for it to have substantial
resistance to erosion by molten metal and slag. However, any change
in the nature of the lining that improves its heat-insulating properties
is usually associated with a reduction in its density, which tends also
to result in reduced erosion-resistance.Thus, a number of prior proposals have been made for the
provision of an expendable lining in a tundish.GB 1364665 describes the provision of an expendable
lining in the form of refractory, heat-insulating slabs.GB 2080505 describes an inner expendable lining of
refractory, heat-insulating slabs having an inward-facing, erosion-resistant
layer and a more heat-insulating backing layer. EP 0180388 describes the use of a parting layer of heat-carbonisable
sheet material between the permanent and expendable
lining.It has also been proposed to apply the expendable lining
directly on to the permanent lining by trowelling, gunning or spraying
rather than fitting pre-formed slabs over the permanent lining.EP 0214882 describes a lining constituted by at least two
layers, namely an inner layer which sinters throughout its mass
under the action of heat from the molten metal and a further layer
that either does not sinter at all or only partially sinters.Difficulties have been encountered in the drying of
sprayed linings in that it is commercially desirable that the drying
period be as short as reasonably possible and drying times of more
than two to two and a half hours are
