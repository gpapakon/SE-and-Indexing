<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus 
records audio signals digitized by rotary heads (9, 10) on 

a magnetic tape (12), and reproduces the recorded audio 
signals. Clock signals and time code data are extracted 

from externally inputted time code signals by means of a 
demodulating circuit (72), and phase difference between 

the frame clock signals and the reference signal is 
detected by a phase difference detecting circuit (74). A 

microcomputer (23) assigns the phase difference 
information and the time code data to sub code packs and 

stores the same in the memory circuit (4). The stored 
phase difference information and the time code data are 

recorded on the magnetic tape. In reproduction, the 
microcomputer outputs the original time code signals 

responsive to the reproduced phase difference information 
and the time code data.

1987.Fig. 56 is a schematic block diagram showing a whole
structure of such a conventional DAT. The structure of
the DAT will be described with reference to Fig. 56.
Analog audio signals of left and right channels are
inputted to an analog signal input terminal 1, and the 
inputted analog audio signals are applied to a low pass
filter (LPF) 2 to restrict the bandwidth of the signals. The
analog audio signals whose bandwidth is restricted are
applied to an analog/digital converting circuit
(hereinafter referred to as an A/D converting circuit) 3
to be converted into digital audio signals. The digital
audio signals are stored in a memory circuit 4. A coding
circuit 5 is connected to the memory circuit 4.
The coding circuit 5 generates codes for detecting or
correcting errors of the digital audio signals stored in
the memory circuit 4.The digital audio signals read from the memory
circuit 4 are applied to a modulating circuit 6 and
modulated. The modulated digital audio signals are
amplified by a recording amplifier 7 and applied to
rotary heads 9 and 10 through a switching circuit 8 for
switching between recording and reproducing. The rotary
heads 9 and 10 are arranged on a rotary drum 11 having a
diameter of 30 mm, and spaced from each other by 180 deg. A
magnetic tape 12 is wound around the rotary drum 11 at the
angle of 90 deg. The magnetic tape runs as a capstan (not
shown) is rotated, and signals are recorded or reproduced
by means of the rotary heads 9 and 10.The digital signals reproduced by the rotary heads 9
and 10 are applied to a reproducing amplifier 13 through 
the switching circuit 8. The reproducing amplifier 13
amplifies the reproduced digital audio signals and applies
the same to a demodulating circuit 14. The demodulating
circuit 14 is used to demodulate the reproduced digital signals
and applies the
