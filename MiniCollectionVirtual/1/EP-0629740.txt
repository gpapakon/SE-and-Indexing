<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method, a device, and an 
arrangement of regulation in a paper machine for 

the control of the transverse profile or profiles of 
properties of the paper web (W) that is produced. 

Water is removed from the paper web (W) under 
compression between two forming wires (11,21) by 

making use of dewatering and/or forming ribs (14, 
24,24A). The deflection of the dewatering and/or 

forming rib or ribs (14;24;24A) in the transverse 
direction of the web (W) is regulated. Thereby the 

retention profile of the paper web (W) in the cross 
direction is affected. By means of the regulation of 

the deflection of the dewatering and/or forming rib 
or ribs (14,24;24a), the transverse fibre-orientation 

profile and/or the filler profile of the paper web 
(W) is influenced through the control of the transverse 

retention profile of the web (W).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method in a paper machine for the control of the transverse
profile or profiles of properties of a paper web, in which method water is removed
from the paper web under compression between two forming wires by making use
of dewatering and/or forming ribs which are deflectable in a regulated manner. Such a method is disclosed in DE 92 12 448 U.Further, the invention concerns a device in a paper machine in the control of the
transverse profile or profiles of properties of a paper web, which device comprises
a MB former, which comprises a twin-wire zone and a MB unit placed in said zone,
in which unit there are two sets of dewatering and/or forming ribs, which operate
one against the other and at least one of which sets of ribs can be loaded by means
of the pressure of a pressure medium against the opposite set of ribs. Such a
device is disclosed in EP 0 372 815 A.Further, the invention concerns an arrangement of regulation in a paper machine for
the control of the transverse profile of properties of a paper web that is produced,
which paper machine comprises a wire part, in whose twin-wire zone there are sets
of ribs placed one opposite to the other and pressed against each other, and which
arrangement of regulation includes an arrangement for measurement of the grammage
profile of the paper web, which arrangement is placed in connection with, or
after, the dryer section of the paper machine and which arrangement gives a
measurement signal to the process control unit, which again gives a regulation signal
to the devices for profiling of the profile bar of the slice of the headbox in the paper
machine.In the way known from the prior art, the headbox of a paper machine includes a
discharge duct, which is defined from below by a, usually stationary, lower-lip beam
and from the opposite side by an upper-lip beam, which is fixed in connection with 
the upper-lip constructions pivotally by means of a horizontal articulated joint. At
the front edge of the upper-lip beam, there is a profile bar, which determines the
exact profile of the slice in the transverse direction of the machine. In the way in
itself known, the profile bar includes regulation devices, by whose means the profile
of the slice is fine-adjusted. As is known from the prior art, the upper-lip beam is
supported from above by means of a number of, as a rule 4...6, support arms.
Attempts have been made to arrange this suspension such that the deflection of the
upper-lip beam is as little as possible, and the fine adjustment
