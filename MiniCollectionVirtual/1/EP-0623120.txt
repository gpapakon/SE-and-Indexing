<DESCRIPTION>
 Piperidineacetic acid derivatives as inhibitors of fibrinogen-dependent blood platelet aggregationThis invention relates to acetic acid derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to their use in medicine.It is widely accepted that the glycoprotein complex Gp Ilb/IIIa is the fibrinogen binding site on platelets that mediates the adhesive function required for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. We have now found a group of non-peptidic compounds which inhibit fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation by blocking the binding of fibrinogen to the putative fibrinogen receptor Gp Ilb/IIIa complex.The invention thus provides the compounds of formula (I)and salts and solvates thereof, in whichX1 and Y1, which may be the same or different, represent CH or N;X2 represents CH or, when X1 represents CH, may also represent N;Y2 represents N or, when Y1 represents N, may also represent CH;Z represents N or N+R5;R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl, CMalkyl or 2,2,2- trifluoroethyl group;R2 represents a hydrogen atom or, when both X1 and X2 represent CH, may also represent a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a CMalkyl group;R3 represents a hydrogen atom or, when both Y1 and Y2 represent N, may also represent a CMalkyl or hydroxymethyl group;R4 represents a hydrogen atom or , when Z represents N, R4 may also represent a CMalkyl group; 

 R5 represents a CMalkyl or phenylCMalkyl group;R6 represents a naphthyl group; a thiophenyl group; an unsubstituted phenyl group; a phenyl group substituted by CMalkyl, C alkoxy, phenylC, -alkoxy, OH, halogen, where halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, CF3 , unsubstituted phenyl, phenyl substituted by OH, pyridinyl, NR7R8, NHSO2R7, CONR7R8 orCO-R.7; a CMalkyl group substituted by one or more naphthyl, phenyl, OH or CO-Jt7; a C-^alkenyl group substituted by one or more naphthyl, phenyl, OH or COjR7; or a saturated or unsaturated Cj-cycloalkyl group; andR7 and R8, which may be the same or different represent H or CMaIkyl or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a saturated 5 to 7 membered ring. In the formulae that follow, the terms "ring -A-" , "ring -B-" and "ring -C-" will hereinafter be used to describe certain rings of formula (I):It will be appreciated that, for pharmaceutical use, the salts referred to above will be the physiologically acceptable salts, but other salts may find use, for example in the preparation of compounds of formula (I) and the
