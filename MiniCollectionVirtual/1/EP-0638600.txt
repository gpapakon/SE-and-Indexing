<ABSTRACT>
Non-pearlescent, single phase, low viscosity, solvent-free isocyanate 
functional urethane prepolymer compositions from hydroxy-terminated diene 

polymers and excess diphenylmethane diisocyanate are obtained at reaction 
temperatures of 100°C or less when the diphenylmethane diisocyanate used in the 

composition includes at least 20% of the isomer 2.4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymers are widely used, for 
instance in liquid moisture curable adhesives and sealants, and as crosslinkers in two 
component adhesives and sealants. They are also used in the manufacture of hot 
melt moisture curable adhesives (HMMC). The typical procedure for making 
isocyanate prepolymers with aromatic polyisocyanates, such as toluene diisocyanate 
or methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), and a polyol is usually accomplished at 
relatively low process temperatures of 70° to 100°C. However, prepolymers made 
with the conventional 4,4'-MDI isomer, i.e. 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 
hydroxy terminated polybutadiene at these process temperatures are hazy, 
pearlescent (a sign of incompatibility) products which phase separate at room 
temperature. In US 4,234,714 a process for making prepolymers with hydroxy 
terminated diene polymers with aromatic isocyanates is described. Following the 
process of this reference, prepolymers based on hydroxy terminated liquid diene 
polymers and normally liquid relatively non-volatile aromatic polyisocyanates, such 
as trihydrocarbyl phosphate-modified methylene-bis-(phenylisocyanate) and 
polyarylene polyisocyanate, are made at a temperature above about 150°C for 1 to 4 
hours. The resulting prepolymer is said to resist the tendency to form multiple 
phases or layers upon storage at room temperature. However, 4,4'-MDI 
prepolymers made by this process still has some hazy pearlescence, a sign of 
incompatibility. A major disadvantage of the process of US 4,234,714 is the extremely 
high process temperature required to make a phase stable prepolymer. The high 
temperature limits the production potential of the process. At high temperatures the 
polydiene polymers can homopolymerize, which increases the molecular weight of 
the polymer and the solution viscosity, and in extreme cases can gel the product. In 
addition, the high process temperature can cause the isocyanate to undergo 
dimerization, or form allophanates, which would also cause the solution viscosity to 
increase.  
 There is therefore a need for a phase-stable, liquid, MDI-based 
isocyanate functional polydiene prepolymer which can be prepared at much lower 
temperatures, desirably at 100°C or less, and which does not produce phase 
separation or pearlescence at ambient temperature storage. The invention in one aspect is a solvent-free isocyanate functional 
urethane prepolymer composition prepared from MDI and a hydroxy terminated 
polydiene, which may be
