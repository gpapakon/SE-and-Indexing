<ABSTRACT>
The intention is to make it possible for the smoker who is accustomed to rolling his own cigarettes to prepare a "pure" tobacco product by hand, without using a paper tube. Use is made of a wrapper blank (1) of tobacco (tobacco leaf or tobacco sheet) and cigarette tobacco as the insert (2). The wrapper blank has a substantially rectangular base part (3), which receives the insert (2), and a winding part (4) which is cohesive with the base part along one long side (5) of the rectangle. A line (6), which prolongs a narrow side of the rectangle, and a further line (7) which starts from an opposite corner (8) and extends at an acute angle to the side (5) of the rectangle define the winding part. The wrapper blank (1) is rolled to form a tubular wrapper, the line (7) coming to lie along a helical line.
