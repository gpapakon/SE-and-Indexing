<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new method of combatting insects at the egg 
level of development, especially eggs of the tobacco budworm (Heliothisvirescens; 
TBW in the abreviated form) at a locus at which there is growing a crop, 
especially a plantation crop. A particular problem among those which farmers have to face is the 
destruction of cotton fibers by tobacco budworm. This problem is a very important 
problem because the larvae insect lives a very short time upon the leaves, e.g. 
about one or two days, and it spends most of its life in the cotton boll where it is 
protected from outside aggression such as the pesticide action. Thus, it is very 
important to reach the tobacco budworm at the egg stage before any damage is 
made to the crop. Thus the invention is also directed to a method of protecting 
cotton crop. Many insecticides are well known as active ingredients to protect plants 
against insects. However the compounds which are recommanded purely for their 
ovicidal action are rather rare, and those which have both an insecticidal and an 
ovicidal action are also rather rare. From the activity of a compound on insects (adults or larvae), nothing can 
be deduced regarding the activity on eggs. For example, insecticides such as 
carbaryl or phosphate insecticides are not ovicidal. Pyrethroids are not ovicidal 
either if they have been sometimes considered as ovicidal, it is just because they  
 
are able to kill the larvae when going out from the eggs, but this is not a true 
ovicidal action. Thiodicarb is considered as having both an ovicidal and an 
insecticidal action, but it is rather an exception. Thus, insecticides have been described in patent application WO 91/04965 
but it is not possible to know whether they have any ovicidal action for the 
hereabove given reasons. An object of the invention is to provide a method of protecting crop by 
killing eggs of insects, or insects at the egg stage, whereby an effective amount of a 
compound of hereafter given formula (I), or a salt thereof, is applied to a locus 
where eggs of insects are located or are supposed to be located or to be going to be 
located. The insects whose eggs are killed according to the invention are especially 
insects which are detrimental to the crop. Formula (I) represents compounds of the formula : 
R1-X-N(R2)-C(R3)=Z-R4 
   wherein 
R1 represents an optionally substituted 5-6 membered aromatic 
hetero ring containing nitrogen atom, except a non-substituted 2-pyridyl ; X represents an optionally substituted C1-3
