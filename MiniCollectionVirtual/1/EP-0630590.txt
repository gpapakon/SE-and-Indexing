<ABSTRACT>
Fit adapter, for example usable in sports shoes such as 
boots, skates, and shoes for soccer, basketball or 

gymnastics. The adapter (1) includes a chamber (2) that can 
be arranged inside the shoe and is connected to the outside 

by means of a single valve (8) for the venting and intake of 
air. An element (9) made of open-cell material is placed 

inside the chamber and allows to simplify the pump system, 
reducing the number of components and thus limiting the 

manufacturing costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fit adapter 
particularly usable in sports shoes. The problem related to the need to achieve optimum fit 
and securing of the foot inside a shoe by virtue of 
pneumatic means is currently strongly felt. On this subject, U.S. Patent No. 4.232.459 granted on 
November 11, 1980 discloses a closure device for ski boots 
comprising a reservoir chamber element that can be arranged 
between the shell and the innerboot and is connected to pump 
means built into the ski boot. The device had the 
characteristic that it connected the pump means to the 
reservoir chamber element by virtue of an air delivery duct. 
An air venting means connected to the plenum-chamber element 
was also provided. Although this solution is undoubtedly valid, it has 
been observed that it has high industrialization costs due 
to the presence of separate ducts and to the need to apply 
separate venting and intake valves for the operation of the 
device. Furthermore, the user must act either on the pump 
means, compressing it one or more times, or on the air 
venting valve, which are usually located in different 
positions, in order to adapt the fit. The aim of the present invention is therefore to solve 
the described technical problems, eliminating the drawbacks 
of the prior art, by providing a device that has low 
production costs and uses a limited number of components. Within the scope of the above aim, an important object  
 
is to provide a device which is reliable and safe in use and 
allows to improve the internal fit of a shoe. Another important object is to provide a device which 
is easy to operate for the user. Another important object is to provide a device that 
can also be applied to conventional types of shoes. This aim, these objects and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a fit adapter, 
particularly for sports shoes, characterized in that it 
comprises at least one air chamber and at least one element 
made of an open-cell material arranged inside said chamber, 
said at least one chamber being connected to the outside by 
means of a single valve for the venting and intake of air. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the detailed description of a 
particular but not exclusive embodiment, illustrated only by 
way of non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, 
wherein: 
figure 1 is a plan view of the adapter according to the 
present invention; figure 2 is a sectional view, taken along the plane II-II 
of

<CLAIMS>
Fit adapter, particularly for sports shoes, 
characterized in that it comprises at least one air chamber 

(2,102a,102b) and at least one element (9) made of an open-cell 
material arranged inside said chamber, said at least 

one chamber being connected to the outside by means of a 
single valve (8,108) for the venting and intake of air. 
Adapter according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it comprises at least one chamber (2,102a,102b) obtained by 

coupling sheets (3a,3b) of plastics along their perimeter so 
as to form internally at least one chamber. 
Adapter according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said element can be compressed elastically. 
Adapter according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said open-cell element, once compressed, by means of the 

escape of a given amount of air through said single valve, 
forces said at least one chamber to expand, drawing air from 

outside through said single valve. 
Adapter according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the compression of said open-cell element is allowed by said 

single valve, which allows the outside venting of the 
corresponding air. 
Adapter, according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it comprises a cover member (110). 
Boot comprising a shell and characterized in that it 
comprises a fit adapter (101) having at least one chamber 

(102a,102b) and at least one open-cell element arranged 
inside each of said at least one chamber, said at least one 

chamber being connected to the outside by means of a single 
 

valve (108) for the venting and intake of air. 
Item of clothing characterized in that it comprises 
a fit adapter according to claim 1. 
Seat characterized in that it comprises a fit 
adapter according to claim 1.
