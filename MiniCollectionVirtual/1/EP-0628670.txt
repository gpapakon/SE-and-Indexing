<ABSTRACT>
This panel (board) (2) is of the type having a laminated structure which is symmetrical with respect to its longitudinal mid-plane, comprising two layers of thermosetting and non-inflammable inorganic resin (4), reinforced with reinforcing fibres having a high thermal resistance and a high mechanical strength and a non-inflammable core of lower density. The core (6) consists of an inorganic filler and of a binder compatible with the resin, enabling it to adhere to the said layers (3, 5).

A fireproof board (2), of the type having a
laminated structure symmetrical with respect to its

longitudinal median plane, comprising two outer layers of
thermosetting, incombustible mineral resin reinforced with

reinforcing fibres exhibiting high thermal resistance and
mechanical strength and an incombustible central core (6)

of lower density, characterised in that the core (6)
consists of a mineral filler and a binder compatible with

the resin, enabling it to adhere directly to said layers
(3, 5).
A board according to claim 1, characterised in
that it comprises, between each outer layer (3) and the

central core (6), a sheet (4) of a material of the same
type as that of the central core (6) but of the order of

twice the density, this sheet (4) being firmly connected
with the central core (6) by an intermediate bonding layer

consisting of resin reinforced with reinforcing fibres,
themselves of the same type as the resin and fibres

constituting the outer layers (3).
A board according to claim 1, characterised in
that :


the resin used is of the inorganic alumino-silicate
type;
the reinforcing fibres consist of at least one glass
fibre fabric; and
the central core (6) consists of mineral fillers and
cellulose fibres bonded together by a calcium silicate.
A board according to claim 2 or claim 3,
characterised in that the intermediate sheets (4) consist

of mineral fillers and cellulose fibres bonded by a calcium
silicate. 
A board according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the resin used is that sold by

GEOPOLYMERE under the brand name "GEOPOLYMITE GP 140".
A board according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the central core (6) and the

intermediate sheets (5) consist of sheets of materials
known respectively by the names "SUPALUX V" and SUPALUX S"

and made by CAPE BOARD or by the name "PROMABEST Y" and
made by PROMAT.
A board according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the outer layers (3) are of the order

of 3 millimetres thick, in that the central core (6) is of
the order of 30 millimetres thick and exhibits a density of

the order of 470 kilograms/m3, in that the intermediate
sheets (4) are of the order of 9 millimetres thick and

exhibit a density of the order of 875 kilograms/m3 and in
that the bonding layers (5) between the intermediate sheets

(4) and the central core (6) are of the order of one
millimetre thick.
A board according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that it forms the leaf or leaves of a

fireproof door and in that it accommodates at these edges
profiles (13) of U-shaped cross section.
