<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette,
used in a tape printer for producing tapes with characters
printed thereon, wherein a tape unit with a print tape
wrapped on a spool is exchangeable in regards to a cassette
case. The present invention relates more particularly to a
tape differentiation member for determining, in cooperation
with a sensor provided to the tape printer, the variety of
tape wrapped on the tape spool.Tapes with characters printed thereon by a tape
printer are used for various objectives. A variety of tapes
with various tape widths are necessary for meeting these
objectives. Conventionally, a variety of tape cassettes are
provided, each for supplying one of the various width tapes.Conventionally a tape width differentiation member
that indicates the width tape held in the tape cassette is
provided attached to an outer surface of the cassette case.
A sensor is provided to the tape printer for detecting the
tape width differentiation member and determining the tape
width of the tape held in the tape cassette.However there has been known a problem with the
above-described conventional tape cassettes in that when the 
tape in a tape cassette is used up, the cassette case for
holding the tape also loses its value although the cassette
case may still be in usable condition. So instead of
replacing only the tape, the entire tape cassette is discarded.
Discarding the cassette case because the tape is used up
is extremely wasteful and is a source of increased running
costs for making tapes. Further, considering that normally
the cassette case is formed from a resin material such as
plastic, discarding the tape cassette merely because the tape
is used up conflicts with recent calls for preservation of
the environment.As mentioned above, in order to determine the width
of the tape in a tape cassette in a conventional tape
printer, a sensor provided to the tape printer detects a tape
width differentiation member attached to an outer surface of
the cassette case. However, the tape width differentiation
member is manually attached to the outer side of each
cassette case separate from the actual tape. Therefore, a
tape width differentiation member that does not accurately
represent the tape width of the tape might be erroneously
attached to the cassette case. When such an error is made
and the tape width of the tape in the tape cassette does not
match the tape width differentiation member attached to the
cassette case, accurate printing can not be performed using
the printer. Furthermore,
