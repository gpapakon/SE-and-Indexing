<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high heat 
conductive insulated substrate and a method of 
manufacturing the same. The packaging density of semiconductor devices 
has become high with the size, degree of integration and 
output of electron circuit becoming small, high and large, 
respectively, by the development in IC (Integrated 
Circuit), LSI (Large Scale Integration), and the like. 
As the degree of integration, output and density of 
semiconductor devices become high or large, the number of 
devices per one chip becomes larger year by year, whereby 
the calorific value per one chip increases. There is 
strongly desired a material for package having high heat 
conductivity, because the increase of calorific value has 
a significant influence upon the reliability of 
semiconductor devices. Further, in the case of hybrid 
IC, heat-generating parts are disposed in the same 
package, so there is required a high heat conductive 
insulated substrate in order to make the packaging 
density still higher. Still further, in consideration of 
actually mounting devices on the substrate, the substrate 
preferably has a coefficient of thermal expansion similar 
to that of the devices, other material constituting package 
and circuit substrates, and enables chips to be bonded 
directly on the substrates. As a substrate which satisfies the above 
requirements, there has been proposed a ceramic substrate 
made of Aℓ + Aℓ₂O₃, crystalline SiC, BeO, AℓN and the 
like, or an enamel substrate obtained by covering metal 
substrate with ceramic. But the above substrates are 
all expensive except an enamel substrate. The substrate 
made of BeO has toxicity. The substrate made of 
crystalline SiC has the problem that the dielectric  
 
constant thereof at high frequency is large, i.e. it is 
about 40 at 1 MHz, because BeO is used as an auxiliary 
for sintering in crystalline SiC. Further, the substrate 
made of Aℓ + Aℓ₂O₃ has problems that the heat conductive 
property and thermal resistance are insufficient, because 
the coefficient of linear expansion of the substrate is 
large and insulating property of Aℓ₂O₃ is in short, 
thereby epoxy coating is required to compensate these 
drawbacks. In the case of cheap enamel substrate, it has 
problems that the coefficient of linear expansion thereof 
is large and heat conductive property is poor. AℓN has 
poor stability to water or alkali. Recently, there have been produced carbon films 
having high hardness comprising diamond, diamond-like 
carbon, i-carbon and the like by means of ion
