<ABSTRACT>
A plastic profile section 8 which can be mounted on a supporting part, especially a car door or a car body, for resting against the supporting part, especially an enamelled vehicle part, and/or against a further part, which may be fixed or movable with respect to the supporting part, especially a pane of glass, is composed of an elongated profile section 10 made of an elastomer material and of a sliding support 16 which is provided on the profile section 10 and rests against the movable part. The sliding support is composed of at least one sealing rib 20 which extends essentially in the longitudinal direction of the profile section 10 and is made of a thermoplastic material which is harder than the material of the profile section 10. Selection of the material for the profile section 10 and the sliding support 16 makes it possible to produce the plastic profile section 8, which has good sliding properties, in a single process.
