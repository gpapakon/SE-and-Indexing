<ABSTRACT>
A frame (10) for framing a poster (18) or similar on a wall (12) is 
disclosed. The frame (10) requires no rigid backing element 

since the wall (12) itself serves to support the poster (18). The 
frame includes a top piece (14), at least two side members (16) and 

a plurality of corner pieces (20) for connecting the top piece (14) 
and the side members (16) to form an enclosing frame (10). Each of 

the side members has a front portion (22) and a rear portion (28), 
with these portions being connected together to form an 

inwardly facing groove (30) for receiving edge portions of the 
poster (18). The rear portion (28) is in the form of a thin flange 

having opposed front (32) and rear (34) surfaces with the front 
surface (32) partially delimiting the groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frame for framing a 
poster or similar on a wall, the frame comprising a top 
piece, at least two side members and a plurality of corner 
pieces for connecting said top piece and said side members 
to thereby form an enclosing frame. The invention also 
relates to a method for framing a poster or similar in such 
a frame on a wall. A frame of the above-mentioned type is disclosed in US 
Patent No. 4 636 105 in the name of the present inventor. 
As shown in Fig. 1 of said document, the frame consists of 
a top arrangement and a plurality of side members. The top 
arrangement and side members are linked together by 
removable corner pieces to form an enclosing frame. The 
side members are each provided with a groove which is 
intended to receive edge portions of a rigid display sheet. 
The top arrangement presents a slot to allow the rigid 
display sheet to be slid into the grooves in the frame. The above-described type of frame has proved to be very 
popular, not least because the corner pieces can be removed 
to thereby allow the frame to be disassembled for ease of 
storage and transportation. When assembled, the frame 
defines an opening in which, for example, a display sheet 
can be accommodated. The display sheet must be sufficiently 
rigid so that it will not flex to an extent where its edge 
portions come out of the grooves, otherwise the sheet could 
fall out of the frame. This need for a rigid sheet implies 
that, although the frame can be easily dismantled, the 
rigid sheet will always present a certain fixed surface  
 
area, thereby hindering transportation. When such a frame 
is used to display a poster, the poster must be supported 
by a rigid backing element, the edge portions of which are 
received in the grooves in the side members. Consequently, 
the frame and backing element are sold as a unit. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a poster frame which takes up less storage space, 
is easier to transport in a disassembled state and is 
cheaper to produce than prior known frames. This object is achieved in accordance with the present 
invention by means of a frame for framing a poster or 
similar on a wall, said frame comprising: 
a) a top piece; b) at least two side members; c) a plurality of corner pieces for connecting said 
top piece and said side members to thereby form an 
enclosing frame;  
wherein each of said side members presents a front portion 
and a rear portion, said front portion and said rear 
portion being

<CLAIMS>
A frame for framing a poster or similar on a wall, 
said frame comprising: 


a) a top piece; 
b) at least two side members; 
c) a plurality of corner pieces for connecting said 
top piece and said side members to thereby form an 

enclosing frame; 
 
wherein each of said side members presents a front portion 

and a rear portion, said front portion and said rear 
portion extending in an inwardly facing direction and being 

connected together to form an inwardly facing groove 
therebetween for receiving edge portions of said poster, 

said rear portion consisting of a thin planar flange having 
opposed front and rear surfaces with said front surface 

partially delimiting said groove, and said thin flange 
extending beyond said front portion in said inwardly facing 

direction. 
The frame as claimed in claim 1, wherein said thin 
flange is provided with 
means for attaching the frame to 
said wall. 
The frame as claimed in claim 2, wherein said means 
for attaching the frame to said wall comprises at least one 

through hole in said thin flange for the introduction of a 
screw or nail. 
The frame as claimed in claim 1, wherein said means 
includes an adhesive applied to the rear surface of said 

thin flange. 
The frame as claimed in claim 1, wherein said top 
piece and said side members are made from an extruded 

plastics material. 
The frame as claimed in claim 5, wherein said top 
piece and said front portion of said side members are in 

the form of a hollow closed extruded section into which 
said corner pieces project to thereby connect said top 

piece and said side members to form said enclosing frame. 
A method for framing a poster or similar in a frame 
on a wall, said frame comprising a top piece, at least two 

side members, each of said at least two side members being 
provided with a groove for receiving edge portions of said 

poster, and a plurality of corner pieces for connecting 
said top piece and said side members to thereby form an 

enclosing frame, said method comprising: 
   mounting said enclosing frame on said wall using 

attachment means on said side members, and 
   inserting said poster into said enclosing frame so 

that edge portions of said poster are received within said 
groove and remaining portions of said poster contact said 

wall to thereby provide support for said poster without the 
need for a rigid backing sheet. 
The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein said 
attachment means comprises a plurality of screws or nails 

passing through corresponding holes in said side members. 
The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein said 
attachment means comprises an adhesive applied to regions 

of said side members.
