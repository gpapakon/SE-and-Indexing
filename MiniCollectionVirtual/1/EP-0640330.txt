<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to absorbent bodies comprising
fibrous material and superabsorbent material whereby the
absorbent bodies can handle relatively large amounts of
discharged body fluids, as well as absorbent articles
including such bodies, for instance disposable diapers,
incontinence articles and training pants.Absorbent articles of this kind generally comprise a
liquid pervious topsheet that is located adjacent the
wearer's body, a liquid impervious backsheet that is
located distant from the wearer's body and adjacent the
wearer's clothing, and an absorbent core or other body
interposed between the liquid pervious topsheet and the
liquid impervious backsheet.It is well established that the construction of the
article, and in particular the construction of the
absorbent body, should desirably be such that the article
is capable of rapidly acquiring and distributing relatively
large volumes of body liquid initially discharged on to the
topsheet, and of storing such discharges. It is also
desirable that the absorbent body should not release stored
liquid when subjected to pressure or prolonged storage.
For instance the absorbent body should be such as to
minimise rewetting of the topsheet by discharge of liquid
that has been stored in the body.In order to promote distribution of liquid discharges
throughout the body, it is desirable to construct the body
so that the discharges are transported away from the area
of initial deposition, both laterally (in the XY plane) and
vertically (in the Z direction).It is known that different fibrous and other materials
promote different performance characteristics. For
instance it is known that a relatively low density stiff
and/or hydrophobic fibrous structure may serve as a useful 
upper acquisition layer for rapidly acquiring and
distributing liquid discharges, but that such a material
may have inadequate storage properties.It is known that the inclusion of superabsorbent
material (often alternatively referred to as polymeric
gelling material, hydrogel-forming material or
superabsorbent polymer) can be included in absorbent bodies
so as to result in a significant increase in the storage
capacity. However it is also known that the use of
significant amounts of superabsorbent material may tend to
be accompanied by a phenomenon referred to as gel blocking.
Gel blocking occurs when the superabsorbent material swells
in such a manner as to reduce significantly the rate of
permeation of liquid that has been applied to the absorbent
structure. This can be minimised by
