<ABSTRACT>
Part of a first signal path (100) for 
amplifying a signal includes circuits (33b, 34b) for 

detecting a signal, and a second signal path (200) 
connected to an input portion of the first signal path 

includes circuits (61b, 62b) for detecting the signal. 
A signal strength detector circuit (5) adds outputs from 

the respective detector circuits in the first and second 
signal paths. The first signal path has a function of 

expanding the dynamic range in a smaller signal region 
as compared with the second signal path, while the 

second signal path has a function of expanding the 
dynamic range in a larger signal region as compared with 

the first signal path. When a radio transmitted output 
is variably controlled in a radio transmitter section 

(TX) based on a field strength detection output for a 
received signal, the transmitted output is optimized, 

resulting in minimizing consumed power and unnecessary 
radiation of radio waves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tecnniques 
which are effectively applicable to radio communication 
apparatuses, for example to digitally controlled 
mobile communication apparatuses. Examples of 
the present invention are directed to techniques which 
are effectively utilized in portable telephones of zone 
selection type, i.e., so-called cellular telephones. A mobile radio system is disclosed in Y. 
Hishida et al, "Mobile Communication system: Its 
semiconductor Technology", HITACHI REVIEW, Vol. 42 - No. 
3, pp. 95-124, June 1993. Also, a signal field strength 
detector circuit is disclosed in JP-A-60-70372. In radio communication apparatuses, 
particularly, mobile radio communication apparatuses 
such as a cellular telephone, a radio zone (cell), a 
communication channel (communication frequency), and so 
on may be frequently changed in accordance with 
transmission conditions. The selection of a radio zone 
(cell) and a communication channel (communication 
frequency) is made based on the field strength of a 
received signal. Therefore, a highly accurate function 
of detecting the field strength of a received signal is 
indispensable to a portable radio telephone such as a 
cellular telephone in order to constantly and properly  
 
carry out the above-mentioned control. A conventional signal amplification/detection 
output circuit having an amplifier circuit composed of a 
plurality of cascade connected amplifiers, each 
providing an amplified signal and a detection signal, 
adds circuit currents of the respective amplifiers, 
which vary in accordance with respective amplified 
signal amplitudes, to produce a summed detection signal 
which is then supplied to a signal strength detector 
circuit. The signal strength detector circuit performs 
processing such as smoothing on the produced detection 
signal and outputs a voltage signal at a DC level 
indicative of a detected field strength of a received 
signal. A variety of controls such as a search for an 
optimal received frequency are performed based on the 
field strength detection output thus produced. However, the present inventors have revealed 
that the above-mentioned techniques have the following 
problems. First, while the above-mentioned conventional 
radio communication apparatus should reduce the noise 
figure (NF) of the amplifier circuit for amplifying a 
received signal for demodulation as well as expand the 
dynamic range for detecting the field strength of 
received signals, these two operations are in 
contradiction to each other.
