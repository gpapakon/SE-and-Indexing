<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to a wood substitute with lignocellulosic and mineral material particles which are moulded in sheet, e.g. plates and/or panels in different thicknesses or forms in stencil at choice, using in principal natural and artificial, vegetal cellulosic material components, e.g. dried leaves, sawdust, rotten wood particles splinters, paperwastes, roots and mineral materials as limestone from sulphates type carbonates or calcium oxides, with synthetic binders from different chemical structures, with or without dyes, in these proportions: 35-60 by weight lignocellulosic components particles, 5-35 by weight limestone types, 5-30 by weight synthetic binders from different harmless chemical structures, with or without synthetic dyes from varied chemical structures and with or without requested additions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a woodsubstitute with lignino-cellulosic 
material and mineral particles which are moulded in 
sheets such as plates or panels of varied thicknesses or diverse 
forms, in stencil, using, at choice, wooden components, in 
pricipal, vegetals and cellulosics as splinters woodchips, 
sawdust and / or woodwool, dried leaves, paperwastes, 
cerealchaff, aquatic plants etc. with a binder and the 
obtaining method. It is known a woodsubstitute, patent RO 37832, which, 
consists of a mixture composed of 500 kg / m3 ricechaff with or 
without wood massaddition, 70-80 kg / m3 technical urea, the 
ratio referring to the ricechaff volume. The product consists in the fact that the ricechaff is 
artificially dried to 2 % humidity and then it is added non-diluted 
viscous Urelit C as adhesive, ammonium sulphate as 
accelerator and technical urea as inhibitor and then the whole 
stuff is mixed in a stirrer, in order to obtain a complete 
homogenizing, then it is poured as a carpet with 60-80 mm 
thickness and pressed with a pressing force between 2-6 kg/cm2 
during 15-25 minutes at a temperature between 130-150 °C in 
order to finish the polimerization process. The product and the obtaining method present the 
disadvantage of a hard working and a limited using area, 
therefore it cannot be moulded in forms in order to obtain 
finished products. In accordance with the patent FR 2578187 it is known 
another woodsubstitute and realization process, which has in 
its composition, resinbark and leaves tied together through a 
mineral binder which assures exclusively the cohesion, in order 
to obtain this product, the bark is grided or crushed at varied 
dimensions, then contacted with a mineral binder and a quantity 
of water which represents the difference between the necessary 
water quantity for a good setting of the bark used in the 
process.The mixture, bark, mineral binder and water is realized 
through the aid of a mechanic equipment then drained before the 
setting or pressed to obtain plates or panels. The used mineral binders can be construction plasters,  
 
stencil plasters or hydraulic binders as Portland cement. This product presents the disadvantage of some limited 
physical and mechanical characteristics and restricted using 
area. Also the patent RO 9262 makes reference to a 
woodsubstitute realization method constituted of sawdust or 
splinters or a mixture of both these materials, with a possible 
addition of a fibred stuff, preferably peat, which are mixed 
with approximately 3-10%

at a temperature ranging among 5-30°C, during 10-40 minutes until a perfect 
homogenizing, then is added 5-15 parts by weight of a product selected from 

bitumen foam, blast-funace cinder and thermopower station ash and continuing the 
homogenizing still 15 minutes until a honey viscosity paste is obtained. 
Method of preparing woodsubstitute according to claim 3 characterized 
in that in the primary preparation phase the ligno-cellulosic component comprises 

forage wastes, sorghum wastes and plant stems the ratios of these varying 
among 10:30:60, 60:10:30 and 30:60:10 parts by weight or rotten wood, bark and 

paper wastes the ratios of these varying among 17:50:33, 50:17:33 and 50:33:17, 
parts by weight,
