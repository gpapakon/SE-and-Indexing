<ABSTRACT>
In a process for disposal of asbestos or substances containing it, the initial material is converted by very fine grinding together with at least one material releasing OH
<
-
>
 ions in water in aqueous suspension into a material having non-fibrous stable mineral phases. In a non-hazardous manner therefore, asbestos is eliminated from the end product to be disposed of or otherwise used.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the disposal of asbestos or material containing 
asbestos, wherein the asbestos or asbestos containing 

materials are transformed by grinding into a material 
which comprises non-fibrous, stable, mineral phases, 


characterized in
 that the grinding is 
carried out in the form of a pulverizing in an aqueous 

suspension, together with at least one substance which 
in water releases OH⁻-ions. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that calcium hydroxide and/or an alkali hydroxide 
are used as substances that release OH⁻-ions in water. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in
 that the pulverizing takes place together 
with a mixture which consists of calcium hydroxide and at 

least one other substance that releases OH⁻-ions in 
water. 
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the ground product obtained 
in aqueous suspension is transferred to an autoclave 

and is treated therein at an increased pressure and 
increased temperature. 
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the starting product to 
be transformed consists of an amphibole asbestos and that 

the ground product obtained in aqueous suspension is 
transferred to an autoclave and is treated therein at an 

increased pressure and increased temperature. 
Method according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized 
in
 that the treatment time in the autoclave  
 

lies in the range from a few minutes to a few hours but, 
preferably around 30 minutes. 
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the ground product obtained 
in aqueous suspension is subjected to an after-treatment 

unpressurized at boiling temperature. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
in
 that the mass ratio of the asbestos 
starting product to be transformed to the substance 

or substance mixture that releases OH⁻-ions in 
water is about 1:1.
