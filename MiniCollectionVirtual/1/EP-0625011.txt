<ABSTRACT>
A process for providing fried battered and breaded food products with enhanced crispiness and golden brown color, wherein fat, caloric content and loss of volatile flavor components are controlled and shelf life of the frying medium is increased, in which a substrate having a moisture content over about 35 % is battered and breaded, coated with a protein dispersion and heated to form a protein film.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED FRIED BATTERED AND BREADED FOODSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONConsumers develop preferences for particular types of food based upon texture, i.e., the tactile experience caused by the food in their mouth in conjunction with the food's distinct physical and chemical characteristics. Fried battered and breaded foods are extremely popular, in good measure because of their crisp texture and their typically golden brown appearance. Indeed, the organoleptic desirability of many fried foods could be significantly improved if enhanced crispiness and golden bro appearance were obtained without overcooking the food or unduly increasing its uptake of oil by frying for extended periods. Additionally, since there is some loss of volatile flavor components during frying, the flavor of fried foods could be further enhanced by minimizing such losses.When it comes to fried battered and breaded foods, there is another important consideration: consumers are becoming increasingly health-conscious. They are turning more and more foods which are high in nutritional value and low in fat and in caloric content. Fried foods, which are typically high in both fat and calories, may derive up to 50% or more of their calorie from fat absorbed during frying. To many health-conscious consumers, fried battered and breaded foods therefore are not considered an acceptable part of the daily diet. In order to satisfy such consumers, a balance must be achieved between supplying fried foods with the preferred crispiness and golden 

brown appearance while controlling the fat and caloric content of such foods.This problem has been addressed in the prior art, albeit inadequately. United States Patent No. 4,518,620 to Monagle, et al. , which issued May 21, 1985, discloses a process for preparing baked breaded foods in which an overcoating of an egg white solution which is applied to increase the integrity and adhesion of the breading also serves as a barrier to fat absorption. Unfortunately, the final food product is tough or soggy, and therefore organoleptically undesirable.United States Patent No. 4,900,573 to Meyers, et al., which issued February 13, 1990, relates to a coating composition for inhibiting oil absorption of food products. Although the coating composition reduces fat absorption, unfortunately it also produces a soggy texture and hence a significant loss of organoleptic appeal.U.S. Patent No. 4,935,251 to Vorhoef describes a process for preparing fried expanded dough pieces (e.g. croutons) with reduced oil penetration on

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process for producing improved fried battered and breaded food products comprising: selecting a food substrate having a water content of at least about 35% of weight; applying batter and breading; applying an aqueous dispersion of a water-dispersible protein which is capable of forming a thermally irreversible film on heating; and waiting at least about one minute and then heating to form a thermally irreversible film.
2. The process of claim 1 in which the food substrate is chosen from among the group consisting of meat, poultry, seafood, cheese, vegetables and fruit. 3. The process of claim 1 in which the substrate is poultry.
4. The process of claim 1 in which the substrate is seafood.
5. The process of claim 1 in which the batter is applied by spraying or dipping.
6. The process of claim 1 in which the batter contains about 60% by weight water.

 7. The process of claim 1 in which the breading is chosen from the group consisting of hydrated or unhydrated, raw, fully cooked or partially cooked cereals such as wheat flour, corn flour, bread crumbs or corn flakes. 8. The process of claim 1 in which the breading is ground to at least 100% through a U.S. No. 4 sieve.
9. The process of claim 1 in which the protein is chosen from the group consisting of caseinates, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, milk protein hydrolysate, and wheat gluten.

13. The process of claim 1 in which the level of protein i the aqueous dispersion of water-dispersible protein is about 10 percent by weight.
14. The process of claim 1 in which the protein dispersion is applied at an application rate at least sufficient to provide about 0.5 percent by weight of protein, based upon the weight of the battered and breaded substrate.
