<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory 
system equipped with a flash EEPROM (Electrically 
Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory) which is a 
non-volatile memory that is electrically and collectively 
erasable and rewritable. More particularly, this invention relates to a semiconductor 
memory system that can realize miniaturization. Most of conventional information processing systems, 
such as a work station and a personal computer, use a 
magnetic disk drive as a secondary memory device. The 
magnetic disk drive has advantages such as a high recording 
reliability and low bit price while having some 
shortcomings such as its being large and susceptible to 
physical impact. The operational principle of magnetic disk drives is to 
move a magnetic head on a rotating disk to write or read 
data on or from that disk. The mechanical moving portions, 
such as the rotatable disk and the magnetic head, 
may malfunction or may be damaged when a physical shock 
is applied to the disk drive. Further, the necessity of 
those mechanical movable portions impedes making the 
whole drive more compact. Accordingly, these deficiencies represent a significant 
problem when loading the magnetic disk drive into a small  
 
portable computer, such as a note book type or pen type 
personal computer. Today, therefore, there is a need for a semiconductor 
memory system which is small in size and not susceptible 
to physical impact. The semiconductor memory system 
usually has a plurality of EEPROM chips. The semiconductor 
memory system can be used as a secondary memory 
device instead of a magnetic disk drive. A computer system 
can use the semiconductor memory system by a same 
method of access for the magnetic disk drive. The semiconductor memory system has several merits in 
the case of use in a personal computer. As one merit, a size of the semiconductor memory system 
can be smaller than a size of the magnetic disk drive. 
However, a EEPROM chip used in the semiconductor memory 
system is very expensive. Therefore, there is a need for 
a product and parts cost of a semiconductor memory system 
that is as low as possible. As another merit, the semiconductor memory system is 
readily adapted to control EEPROM and is resistant to 
breakage because it does not include movable parts. 
However, a cell array of an EEPROM is deteriorated by 
rewrite operations (erase and write) little by little. In 
time, one of the flash EEPROMs in the semiconductor 
memory system will have some memory blocks which cannot
