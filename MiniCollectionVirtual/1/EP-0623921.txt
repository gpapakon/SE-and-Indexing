<ABSTRACT>
Outputs of first and second photodetectors (1,2) are supplied to first and second 
normalizing circuits (8,9) and are also added by an adding circuit (7). An output of the 

adding circuit (7) is supplied to the normalizing circuits (8,9). By the output supplied 
from the adding circuit (7) to the normalizing circuits (8,9), the outputs supplied from 

the photodetectors (1,2) to the normalizing circuits (8,9) are normalized. A subtraction 
is performed between the outputs of the normalizing circuits by a subtracting circuit 

(11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to signal
detecting method and apparatus for processing a
reproduction signal from an optical disc in which
additional information such as an address or the like is
recorded by wobbling a groove for tracking and, more
particularly, to signal detecting method and apparatus
which can accurately detect the additional information
from the optical disc.A CD-R disc is known as a writable optical disc.
In the CD-R disc, additional information such as an
address or the like is recorded by wobbling a groove in
advance. That is, for example, a carrier of a
predetermined frequency (for example, 22.05 kHz) is
modulated by the additional information such as an address
or the like. On the basis of the additional information
modulated, the groove for tracking is wobbled.The frequency of the signal which was wobble
recorded as mentioned above is enough higher than that of
a tracking error signal. Therefore, by separating a
predetermined frequency component from the tracking error
signal, a wobble signal can be detected.That is, for instance, a groove 51 is provided
along a track on a writable optical disc such as a CD-R or
the like as shown in Fig. 3. The groove 51 is wobbled on 
the basis of the additional information modulated. A
deviation of the wobble is set to a small value of about
30nm so as not to exert an influence on a signal component
by a pit.A two-divided detector comprising detectors 61a
and 61b as shown in Fig. 4 is provided for such an optical
disc. When a laser beam 53 is irradiated to the optical
disc, the reflection light is supplied to the two divided
detectors 61a and 61b. By performing a subtraction
between outputs of the two divided detectors 61a and 61b,
a tracking error signal is obtained. On the basis of the
tracking error signal obtained as mentioned above, a
tracking servo is performed.Although the groove 51 has been wobbled, since a
frequency of the wobble is enough higher as compared with
a frequency of the tracking error signal, the laser beam
53 doesn't trace along the groove wobbled but traces the
center of the track as a whole.When the laser beam 53 is allowed to trace along
the track, a signal as shown in Fig. 5A is obtained from
the detector 61a and a signal as shown in Fig. 5B is
obtained from the detector 61b. When a subtraction is
performed between the outputs of the detectors 61a and 61b
and a tracking error signal component is eliminated from
the subtracted value, a wobble signal as shown in Fig. 5C
is detected. By demodulating the wobble signal,
