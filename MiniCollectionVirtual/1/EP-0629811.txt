Apparatus for transferring liquid helium between two devices at 
different potentials, the apparatus comprising: 


first and second endpieces (1, 2); 
first and second metal endpiece tubes (3, 4); 
first and second internal metal tubes (5, 6) for conveying liquid 
helium; 
internal insulating connection means (7); 
external insulating connection means (8) having fins (9) disposed 
around the periphery thereof; and 
a pumping passage (10). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, for transferring liquid helium 
between two devices at different potentials, in which: 


respective ends of the first internal metal tube (5) for conveying 
liquid helium penetrate inside the first metal endpiece tube (3) and 

inside one end of the internal insulating connection means (7); 
respective the ends of the second internal metal tube (6) for 
conveying liquid helium penetrate inside the second metal endpiece 

tube (4) and inside the other end of the internal insulating 
connection means (7); 
respective ends of the external insulating connection means (8), 
having fins (9) disposed around the periphery thereof, enclose the 

first and the second metal endpiece tubes (3, 4); 
the first and second endpieces (1, 2) are secured to the first and 
second metal endpiece tubes (3, 4) respectively; and 
the pumping passage (10) is disposed on one of the metal endpiece 
tubes (3, 4).
