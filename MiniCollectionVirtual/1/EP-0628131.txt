<ABSTRACT>
A well fluid sampling tool and method for retrieving chemically accurate hydrocarbon samples from new wells. The sampling tool is provided with a chemically inert sample chamber and lowered to the required depth in the well where a well fluid sample is admitted to the sample chamber, which is subsequently sealed. The tool is preferably arranged so that pressures inside and outside the sample chamber remain substantially equal during and after sample taking. The sample may be subject to post-sampling pressurisation to keep the sample in its original single-phase state. The chemical inertness of the sample chamber avoids removal of reactive components of the well fluid from the sample by chemical reaction with the material of the sample chamber (which is conventionally metal). This enables accurate assessment of new wells without the need for extended flow testing. Equalisation of pressures inside and outside the sample chamber enables the material of the sample chamber to be selected for its chemical inertness rather than for mechanical strength to resist forces otherwise arising from pressure imbalances.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Well Fluid Sampling Tool and Well Fluid Sampling Method"This invention relates to a well fluid sampling tool and to a well fluid sampling method.Hydrocarbon fluids (oil and gas) are found in geological reservoirs wherein they are contained at a high pressure (relative to ambient atmospheric pressure) , and usually also at an elevated temperature (relevant to ambient atmospheric temperature) . At such pressures, the gas is dissolved in the oil such that the reservoir fluid initially exists as a single-phase fluid, but the reservoir fluid will release dissolved gas to form a two-phase fluid with separate gas and oil components if the reservoir fluid has its initial pressure sufficiently reduced towards ambient atmospheric pressure. Also, the initial relatively high temperature of the reservoir fluid results in volumetric contraction of a given mass of fluid as it cools toward ambient atmospheric temperature if withdrawn from the well.When hydrocarbon exploration wells are drilled and hydrocarbon fluids are found, a well fluid test is 

 usually performed. This test usually involves flowing the well fluid to surface, mutually separating the oil and the gas in a separator, separately measuring the oil and gas flow rates, and then flaring the products.It is also desirable to take samples of the oil and gas for chemical and physical analysis. Such samples of reservoir fluid are collected as early as possible in the life of a reservoir, and are analysed in specialist laboratories. The information which this provides is vital in the planning and development of hydrocarbon fields and for assessing their viability and monitoring their performance.Reservoir fluids and gasses can have a complex composition and often include compounds such as hydrogen sulphide (H~S) , carbon dioxide and other trace elements including mercury which, when produced, can have a significant effect on process design, product sales and the environment.During well testing of newly discovered reservoirs, it is essential that the oil company gains an accurate understanding of the fluid composition in order properly to evaluate the downstream potential of the reservoir. Flow periods are normally kept short during well testing because of the very high cost of the operation.During a typical flow period of 18 to 24 hours, low levels of H_S may not be detected at a surface analytical station because of chemical reaction of the H-S with metallic tubing in the well completion between reservoir and surface, such that the H_S is effectively
