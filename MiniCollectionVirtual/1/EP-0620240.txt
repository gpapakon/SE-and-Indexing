<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the preparation of a discoloration-free, high-molecular-weight 
(co)polycarbonate by polycondensing a 
dihydroxy compound with a carbonic diester in the 
presence of a transesterification catalyst. A high-molecular-weight polycarbonate is a 
general-purpose engineering thermoplastic useful in 
various fields, particularly as a material for 
injection molding or a sheet substituting for window 
pane. Polycarbonate is generally believed to be 
excellent in heat resistance, transparency and impact 
resistance. Ordinary processes for the preparation of a 
polycarbonate include the phosgene process wherein the 
interfacial polycondensation of a dihydroxy compound 
with phosgene is conducted and the transesterification 
process wherein a dihydroxy compound is reacted with a 
carbonic diester in a molten state. A representative example of the transesterification 
process comprises reacting a dihydric  
 
phenol with a carbonic diester in the presence of a 
transesterification catalyst under heating under a 
reduced pressure while distilling off formed phenol to 
form a prepolymer and converting the prepolymer into a 
high-molecular-weight polycarbonate by bringing the 
resulting system finally to 290°C or above in a high 
vacuum while distilling off formed phenol [see U.S. 
Patent No. 4345062 (date of patent: Aug. 17, 1982; 
assignee: GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.)]. In the transesterification process, it is known 
that a process which comprises forming a prepolymer in 
an ordinary tub-type reactor fitted with an agitating 
blade in the early stage of the reaction and 
thereafter polycondensing the resulting reaction 
mixture comprising the prepolymer in a horizontal 
vented extruder or the like is effective in advancing 
the reaction efficiently to form a high-molecular-weight 
polycarbonate. Unlike other engineering plastics, a high-molecular-weight 
polycarbonate, however, has such a 
high melt viscosity that the preparation thereof 
necessitates a reaction temperature of as high as 
280°C or above. Further, a high vacuum (of 1 to 10⁻² 
Torr) is also necessary for distilling off a 
high-boiling monohydric compound formed. Accordingly,  
 
the industrial production of a high-molecular-weight 
polycarbonate is difficult from the standpoint of 
plant facilities and, further, there is a problem that 
the reaction conditions described above give bad 
influences upon the qualities of the formed 
polycarbonate, such as hue, heat resistance, residence 
stability in molding,
