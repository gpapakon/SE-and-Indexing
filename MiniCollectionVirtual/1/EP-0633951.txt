<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes of treating metal 
surfaces with aqueous acidic compositions to increase the 
resistance to corrosion of the treated metal surface, either 
as thus treated or after subsequent overcoating with 
some conventional organic based protective layer. A major 
object of the invention is to provide a storage stable, 
single package treatment that can be substantially free 
from hexavalent chromium but can protect metals substantially 
as well as the hexavalent chromium containing treatments 
of the prior art, or can improve the stability of 
treatment solutions that do contain hexavalent chromium. A very wide variety of materials have been taught in 
the prior art for the general purposes of the present invention, 
but most of them contain hexavalent chromium or 
other inorganic oxidizing agents which are environmentally 
undesirable. The specific items of related art believed by 
the applicant to be most nearly related to the present invention  
 
are noted below. U. S. - A 5,089,064 
teaches a process for treating aluminum with a composition 
containing fluozirconic acid (H2ZrF6), a water soluble or 
dispersible polymer of 3-(N-C1-4 alkyl-N-2-hydroxyethylaminomethyl)-4-hydroxystyrene, 
and dispersed silica. This 
treatment produces excellent results, but is somewhat inconvenient 
because the treating composition is susceptible 
to slow settling of the dispersed silica component. In 
practice, this means that for best results, at least two 
components, one with the silica and one without, must be 
stored separately and mixed shortly before use. U. S. - A 4,963,596 
teaches the use of water soluble derivatives of poly 
(vinyl phenol) in metal treating, including combinations of 
these polymer materials with dispersed silica among many 
other possibilities. U. S . - A 4,921,552 
teaches treating aluminum with a composition comprising 
fluozirconic acid, hydrofluoric acid, and a water soluble 
polymer. Published European Patent Application 0 273 698 (published 
July 6, 1988) teaches aqueous acidic treating solutions 
comprising trivalent metal compounds, silica, and 
preferably also nickel and/or fluoride ions. The counter 
anions for the trivalent metal cations used may be silicofluoride. U. S. - A 4,341,558 
teaches treating metal surfaces with a composition containing 
a water soluble salt of zirconium and/or titanium, 
an inositol phosphate ester, and silica. The composition 
may also contain an organic binder such as poly(vinyl alcohol). U. S. - A 4,277,292
