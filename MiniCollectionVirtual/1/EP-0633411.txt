<ABSTRACT>
This system for assisted gear-selection comprises an electrohydraulic actuator (12) for operating the input member of the gearbox, which can itself be operated by parameters supplied by an engine control computer; the actuator (12) includes a set of solenoid valves (34, 35, 37, 52, 53) connected to control cylinders (15, 16, 41, 42) for operating the fork-selection shaft (13), in the case of a fork-type gearbox; the control cylinders (15, 16) can bring about the rotation of the shaft (13) by means of a rocker (14) in order to select the fork corresponding to the chosen ratio, and operate the shaft (13) in terms of translation in order to engage the chosen ratio through displacement of the selected fork. This automatic selection system, which is also applicable to gearboxes of the barrel type, makes it possible, in conjunction with the engine control computer, to spare the driver from the declutching/clutch engagement operation while having complete control over his choice of gear if such is his wish, and this is all achieved without losses through slip.
