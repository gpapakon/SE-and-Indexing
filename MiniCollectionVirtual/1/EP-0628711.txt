<ABSTRACT>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine of a 
motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12) having 

an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38) extending 
therethrough and an outer wall (40), the bore having a 

longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14) extending across 
the bore and having a longitudinal axis (y) 

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 
of the bore, the shaft being rotatably mounted in the 

inner wall of the throttle body for pivotal movement 
about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, at least one 

end (42) of the shaft passing through the inner wall 
to extend beyond the outer wall; a flap valve (16) 

secured to the shaft inside the bore for movement 
between a fully open position and a substantially 

closed position on rotation of the shaft; means 
(18,20) secured to the said one end of the shaft 

adjacent the outer wall for rotating the shaft; and an 
air horn (24) securable to the throttle body for the 

passage of air into the throttle body; the throttle 
body having a pair of end faces (35,37) which are 

substantially identical, and two apertures (46,48) 
passing therethrough from one end face to the other 

through which securing means (58) can extend to secure 
the throttle body to the engine, the apertures having 

a longitudinal axis which is substantially parallel to 
the longitudinal axis of the bore, and the apertures 

being diametrically opposed relative to the 
longitudinal axis of the bore.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a throttle
mechanism for an engine of a motor vehicle.There are numerous designs of throttle
mechanisms for engines which are well known to these
skilled in the art. These known throttle mechanisms
basically comprise a throttle body with a bore
therethrough, a shaft extending across the bore and
having a flap valve secured thereto, and means for
rotating the shaft relative to the throttle body.
Generally, the problem associated with these known
designs is that for each design of engine, and/or for
each application of the throttle mechanism, a
different design of throttle mechanism is required in
terms of the layout of the throttle mechanism and/or
the layout of the elements attached to, or forming
part of, the throttle mechanism. Figures 1 to 3 of
DE-A-4202437 disclose a throttle mechanism in
accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of these disadvantages.To this end, a throttle mechanism in
accordance with the present invention is characterised
over DE-A-4202437 by the features specified in the
characterising portion of claim 1. With this arrangement, the throttle body can
be secured relative to the engine in one of several
orientations by rotating the throttle body through
180Â° about the longitudinal axis of the shaft and/or
the bore. The position of elements attached to the
throttle body, such as the throttle linkage, idle air
control valve assembly, etc., relative to the engine
can therefore easily be altered to meet the necessary
layout requirements. As a consequence, one design of
throttle body can be used for several different
applications.The present invention will now be described,
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a plan view of a throttle
mechanism in accordance with the present invention;Figure 2 is an end view of a manifold to
which the throttle mechanism of Figure 1 can be
attached;Figure 3 is a plan view of an air horn which
is attached to the throttle mechanism of Figure 1;Figure 4 is a side view in the direction of
arrow IV in Figure 1 showing the attachment of the
throttle position sensor and the idle air control 
valve motor but with other features omitted for
clarity;Figure 5 is a side view in the direction of
arrow V in Figure 1 showing the fluid heating means
and the air horn positioned on the throttle body but
with other features omitted for clarity;Figure 6 is a side view in the direction of
arrow VI in Figure 1 showing the throttle

<CLAIMS>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine
of a motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12)

having an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38)
extending therethrough and an outer wall (40), the

bore having a longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14)
extending across the bore and having a longitudinal

axis (Y) substantially perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the bore, the shaft being

rotatably mounted in the inner wall of the throttle
body for pivotal movement about the longitudinal axis

of the shaft, at least one end (42) of the shaft
passing through the inner wall to extend beyond the

outer wall; a flap valve (16) secured to the shaft
inside the bore for movement between a fully open

position and a substantially closed position on
rotation of the shaft; means (18,20) secured to the

said one end of the shaft adjacent the outer wall for
rotating the shaft; and an air horn (24) securable to

the throttle body for the passage of air into the
throttle body; the throttle body having a pair of end

faces (35,37) which are substantially identical to one
another; characterised in that the throttle body (12)

has two apertures (46,48) passing therethrough from
one end face (35) to the other (37) through which

securing means (58) can extend to secure the throttle
body to the engine, the apertures having a

longitudinal axis which is substantially parallel to
the longitu
dinal axis of the bore, and the apertures
being diametrically opposed relative to the

longitudinal axis of the bore; and in that the
throttle body (12) comprises first and second idle air

bores (62,64) which extend through the throttle body

parallel to the longitudinal axis (X) of the bore (38) 
and which are spaced apart, one end of the first idle

air bore at one end face being closed on securing the
throttle mechanism (10) to the engine, and one end of

the second idle air bore at the other end face being

2, wherein the apertures (46,48) of the pairs of

apertures are equidistantly spaced apart.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in any
one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the air horn (24) has

corresponding apertures (54,56), and wherein the
