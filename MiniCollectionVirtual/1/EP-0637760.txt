<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the electromagnetic detection of objects which can oscillate (vibrate). Instead of a swing frequency (wobbler frequency), the method employs a series (sequence) of short pulses to generate a high-frequency and a low-frequency search field.

Method for the electromagnetic detection of objects,
which are capable of oscillating and/or have conductive

and/or comprise dielectric characteristics, in
which electromagnetic oscillations are emitted in the

form of a continuous sequence of short, steep-front

pulses with a relatively large spacing as primary signals
in the area of an object to be detected, and the

secondary signals from the detected object are
received and evaluated,
characterized
 in

that as primary signals bipolar pulses are emitted,
that the primary signals are emitted via a decoupled
loop system and
that the high and low frequency secondary signals induced
by each pulse are evaluated for specifying the

objects, the secondary signals being received as a
time signal and/or as instantaneous values both in and

following the primary signal pulses.
Method according to claim 1,
characterized
 in

that as the primary signal use is made of bipolar pulses
with a pulse duration in the range 40 to approximately

200 ns and a variable or sweepable repetition
frequency of approximately 2 to 15 kHz. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterized
 in

that the high frequency secondary signal of an object
capable of oscillation induced by a pulse of the primary

signal is detected as damped oscillation following
the pulse of the primary signal, that conductive

and/or dielectric secondary signals are eliminated and
that the period of the damped oscillation of the secondary

signal is evaluated for determining the length
and/or frequency of the detected object.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized
 in

that for the detection of dielectric objects, the
secondary signals are time-analyzed in the area of the

rising and/or falling side of the particular primary
signal pulse.
Method according to claims 1 to 4,
characterized
 in

that a decoupling of the primary and secondary loop
system is used, so that simultaneously the received

secondary signal for conductive objects is investigated
in the primary signal pulse.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized
 in

that for detection purposes use is made of a loop system
as a relative or differential measuring instrument.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized
 in

that the detection of the sought object or objects
takes place with coded frequency set to an object-specific,

predetermined resonant circuit frequency. 
Method according to claim 7,
characterized
 in

that the object-specific resonant circuit frequency is
produced by pedetermined turns of a conductor, which

is in particular in the form of a printed circuit.
