<ABSTRACT>
An electric vehicle drive train includes a controller for detecting and compensating for vehicle rollback, as when the vehicle is started upward on an incline. The vehicle includes an electric motor rotatable in opposite directions corresponding to opposite directions of vehicle movement. A gear selector permits the driver to select an intended or desired direction of vehicle movement. If a speed end rotational sensor associated with the motor indicates vehicle movement opposite to the intended direction of vehicle movement, the motor is driven to a torque output magnitude as a nonconstant function of the rollback speed to counteract the vehicle rollback. The torque function may be either a linear function of speed or a function of the speed squared.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
electric vehicles, and more particularly, to a drive
train for an electric vehicle including control of
electric motor torque output.Electric vehicles are receiving considerable
attention as a substitute for present gasoline-fueled
vehicles. This interest is based primarily on zero
atmospheric emissions obtainable from an all-electric
vehicle. Several states are considering stricter
emissions regulations for vehicles, and California has
adopted regulations that will require zero emissions
for a percentage of vehicles in certain urban areas.
Electric vehicles also offer other advantages including
reducing dependency on imported oil, since utilities in
the United States generate a large portion of their 
energy demands using coal, gas, nuclear, and
hydroelectric sources.Even hybrid electric vehicles, such as those
incorporating a small gasoline engine running at a
constant speed to recharge an electric traction
battery, offer anticipated lower emissions. See, for
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,351,405 to Fields et al.
which discloses a hybrid vehicle including a gasoline
engine for driving the front wheels during high speed
and long distance driving, while the rear wheels are
connected to electric motors for low speed and stop and
go driving.To obtain widespread acceptance as a suitable
substitute for conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles,
an electric vehicle should desirably mimic the
operation of such a conventional gasoline vehicle,
especially the drive train including a conventional
automatic transmission. Functions such as braking and
acceleration are readily controlled in an electric
vehicle through a conventional brake pedal and
accelerator pedal. The selection of drive, reverse,
park, and neutral positions are also imitated on an
electric vehicle. However, in a conventional gasoline
vehicle, the engine always rotates in a same direction
and the vehicle includes a clutch or fluid coupling to
transmit torque to the vehicle wheels. In other words,
a conventional automatic transmission will tend to
start the vehicle moving forward, or creep, on a level
surface once the driver releases the brake with the
engine idling.Moreover, starts upward on an incline are
readily accommodated in a gasoline vehicle because the
creep of the automatic transmission compensates for
vehicle rollback during the time from when the driver
releases the brake until the driver can depress the
accelerator. In addition, even a conventional vehicle
with a standard transmission includes
