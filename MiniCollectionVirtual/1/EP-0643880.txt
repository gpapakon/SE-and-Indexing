<DESCRIPTION>
 ACTIVE/PASSIVE HEADSET WITH SPEECH FILTERThis invention relates to the area of headsets worn by a user in specific environments and, in particular, those areas where the background noise must be abated while simultaneously allowing speech through.Generally, environmental noise can be broken into several areas such as noises of short duration with varying spectral characteristics such as conversations, other long duration noise with fixed or relatively fixed spectral characteristics such as operating pumps, fans, engines etc., and noises of very brief duration with "spike" characteristics such as something rattling, etc.The instant invention is intended for use in environments found in industry, such as those requiring attenuation of low frequency noise as well as noise covering the speech band (300 - 3300 Hz).Passive headsets have been employed and work extremely well at higher frequencies above 1000 Hz but don't perform at all in the lower frequency ranges. In these lower ranges active cancellation has been shown to work extremely well and the provision of high levels of protection are afforded users in the 50 to 1000 Hz range.The instant headset provides protection at both the high frequency range (above 1000 Hz) as well as the low range (50 to 1000 Hz). In the past, attempts to combine the two protections, i.e., high and low frequency attenuation, has resulted in not only the noise being attenuated but also the speech that the wearer needs to hear. Some systems met only limited success with fixed or "near-stationary" noise but not with the other noise of either (a) varying spectral characteristics or (b) brief duration noises with "spikes". Examples of such a system is found in U.S. Patent No. 4,025,721, to Graupe et al and U.S. Patent 4,185,168 to Graupe et al.The instant invention solves the problem now existant, that of total attenuation of the noise and speech, by providing a solution of an active/passive headset that can employ any of several selective algorithms such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 

5,091,953 to Tretter, hereby incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, it can employ the algorithm disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,105,377 to Ziegler which is also incorporated herein by reference. In addition, it can employ other algorithms such as that disclosed in the application of Ziegler in U.S. Patent Application No. 07/421 759 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.The technique of actively controlling noise is disclosed in various patents to Barry Chaplin especially

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. An active/passive noise canceling headset for attenuating high and low frequency noise, said headset comprising a headset means having closed back earpiece means adapted to prevent external noise from entering the ear through passive attenuation, speaker means associated with said earpiece means and adapted to produce anti-noise of the same level as the noise to be canceled, reference sensing means also associated with said earpiece means and adapted to produce advanced information about the noise to be canceled, and controller means adapted to secure information from said reference sensing means and cause emission of anti-noise by said speaker means.
2. A headset as in claim 1 and including residual sensing means also associated with said earpiece means and adapted to produce a signal characterizing the sound remaining at the ear.
3. A headset as in claim 2 and including a feedback loop means connecting said residual sensing means to said controller means and whereby said. controller means makes adjustments to the anti-noise in response to the sound sensed by said residual sensing means.
4. A headset as in claim 3 wherein said reference sensing means are electret microphones or other type of microphones.
5. A headset as in claim 3 wherein said residual sensing means are electret microphones. 


6. A headset as in claim 1 and wherein said controller means contains an adaptive speech filter means adapted to attenuate disturbing noise in the audible range of the human ear yet leave the speech to the headset wearer intelligible.
7. The method of controlling the amount of noise interfering with speech, said method comprising sensing signal containing speech and noise and converting it to electronic signals, using "in-wire" control approach producing "anti-noise" to cancel said noise component of the signal.
8. The method of claim 7 and including the step of passively quieting the higher frequency portions of the noise to be canceled simultaneous with the production of anti-noise.
9. The method of claim 8 and including the further step of sensing the noise remaining adjacent the ear after cancellation by said anti-noise and changing the anti-noise production in response to the amount of remaining noise.
10. The method of claim 9 and including the step of mixing the signals from sensing the noise containing noise and speech with the signal producing the anti-noise thus allowing speech to pass to the ear.
11. The method of filtering speech from noise said method comprising sensing signal containing speech and noise and converting it to electronic signals, adaptively filtering the signal to separate the noise component from the speech component and producing a signal that contains only the speech component.
12. The method of manual selection of either the method of claim 7 or the method of claim 8 or both based upon characteristics of the noise environment wherein 


 said manual selection is a switch that allows the user to select a preferred approach for allowing speech to be most intelligible.
13. The method of automatic selection of either the method of claim 7 or the method of claim 8 or both based upon the spectral and temporal characteristics of the noise environment wherein said automatic selection is achieved using a detection algorithm that continuously monitors the spectral and temporal characteristics of the noisy signal.
14. The method as in claim 10 wherein said selection of adaptive speech filtering occurs when the noise is near-stationary and of limited bandwidth.
15. The method as in claim 10 wherein said selection of in- wire control occurs when the noise is varying and tonal or broadband.
16. The method of manual selection of claim 12 wherein a setting to automatic selection can be made.
17. The method of manual selection of claim 12 wherein a setting to an off position can be made.
