<ABSTRACT>
In a method of manufacturing an endless belt of flexible 
material along at least one side edge of the belt there is 

fastened an upwardly extending heel (11) such that when the 
belt is in a flat position there prevails a pressure stress in the 

side of the heel remote from the belt. The belt can be provided 
with grooves (10) extending transversely of the longitudinal 

direction of the belt between heels fastened to said belt.

<DESCRIPTION>

 Method of manufacturing an endless conveyor belt of flexible
 material, conveyor belt and device comprising a frame and a
 conveyor belt arranged in said frame.


 The invention relates to a method of manufacturing an endless conveyor belt of flexible material, along at least one side edge of which an upwardly extending heel is fastened.


 Such conveyor belts, which are frequently provided along both longitudinal or side edges with upwardly extending heels, are employed, for example, in vacuum belt filters or the like, where the upwardly extending heels are provided for preventing material to be displaced with the aid of the conveyor belt from sliding sideways off the conveyor belt.


 It is common practice to arrange the heels on the side edges of the belts, for example, by vulcanizing or gluing, the belt and the heels being disposed on each other in a flat plane without being loaded. When during operation a belt manufactured in this way moves along a reversing roller or the like and is bent thereby, that part of the belt that is located above the so-called neutral line usually located at the area of reinforcing layers for the material of the belt and located in the upper part of the heel above the neutral line of said heel will be elongated. This elongation may after some time give rise to cracks in the material of the belt and/or the heel as well as   to diszngagement    of the glue   connectionbetween    the belt and the heel.  


The elongation   amounts    to
EMI2.1     
 wherein x= height of the material above the neutral line,
R= radius of curvature of the neutral line.


 Consequently the risk of damage of the kind set forth occurs in particular two places i.e.


 1. the upper face of the.belt commonly made from comparatively hard rubber, in which. in practice an elongation of 5 to 10 % may give rise to cracks,
 2. the top side of the heel usually -made from comparatively soft rubber, where an elongation of 20 to 25 % may result in the formation of cracks.


 One   mssibility    of preventing such a formation of cracks resides in the choice of the   latest    possible diameters of the drums, along which the belt is passed. However, this involves a bulky and expensive construc
 tion of the device comprising the flexible conveyor belt.


 According to a first aspect of the invention the heel is fastened to the belt in a manner such that in the flat Dosition of the belt comPression stress prevails on   th.    side of the heel remote from the belt. When such a belt is used and passed along a

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS 1. A method of manufacturing an endless conveyor belt of flexible material, along at least one side edge of which is fastened an upwardly extending heel characterized in that the heel is fastened to the belt in a manner such that, when the   belts    in a flat position, a pressure stress prevails in the side of the heel remote from the belt.



2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 characterized in that during the manufacture of the heel a curve is imparted to the heel.



3. A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the heel is fastened to the belt whilst the belt is lying on a curved surface.



4. A Method as claimed in Claim 1 characterized in that the heel is arranged in two at   leastssubstantially    superimposed parts, at least the upper part being arranged so that a pressure stress prevails therein, when the belt is lying in a flat position.



5. A method as claimed in anyone of the preceding Claims characterized in that when the belt is in a flat position,the pressure stress in the side of the heel remote from the belt is equal to an appreciable portion of the tensile stress produced in the side of the heel remote from the belt when the belt is curved to a maximum during its   opetration.   



6. An endless conveyor belt manufactured by the method according to the invention.



7. A conveyor belt of flexible material having grooves extending transversely of the direction of   legit    of the belt and provided in an upper layer of the belt, the thickness of which is at least substantially equal to the depth of the grooves characterized in that width of the upper layer corresponds with the width of the belt covered by the grooves.  



8. A conveyor belt as claimed in Claim 7 characterized in that the side edges of the belt, whose upper faces are located at least substantially at the level of the bottom sides of the grooves are provided with upwardly extending heels preferably in a manner such that, when the belt is in a flat position, a pressure stress prevails in the side of the heel remote from the belt.



9. A conveyor belt as claimed in Claim 7 or 8 characterized in that the grooves are bounded by ridges which are manufactured seperately from the belt, preferably by compression or extrusion and subsequently applied to a substrate of the conveyor belt.



10. A conveyor belt as claimed in Claim 9 characterized in that a plurality of groove-bounding ridges are made together with a substrate interconnecting said ridges in the form of a single strip.

 


11. A conveyor belt as claimed in Claim 10 characterized in that along one edge the strip is provided with a protruding nose and at the other edge with a recess having a shape corresponding with that of the nose.



12. A device comprising a frame and a conveyor belt arranged in said frame and having at least its uppper run supported by beams characterized in that that the beams are disposed at   ar    acute   angle    to   the    direction of displa   clement    of the belt during operation.



13. A device as claimed in   Claim12    characterized in that means are provided for wetting the belt before the belt comes into contact with a beam supporting it.
