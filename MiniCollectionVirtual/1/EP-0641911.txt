<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a swing door suitable especially for use in motor vehicles, with a connecting mechanism for the pivotable connection of the door to the object to be closed, that is to say, for example, the chassis of the motor vehicle. The connecting mechanism has a first connecting device (1) and a second connecting device (2), the first connecting device (1) being articulated in a first joint (7) on the object to be closed and in a second joint (5) on the door, and the second connecting device (2) being articulated in at least one third joint (3) on the object to be closed and in at least one fourth joint (4) on the door. The first connecting device (1) is provided at both ends with threaded portions (6) which are connected screwably to the first and second joint respectively, with the result that an adjustment or a variation of the closing kinematics of the door becomes possible as a result of a rotation of the first connection device (1) designed as a rod.
