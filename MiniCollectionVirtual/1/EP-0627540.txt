<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical hook-closure device (10) for application in 
particular to furniture and the like for holding doors 

closed, in which a control mechanism (12) operates the 
hooks (14) which hold the doors closed through at least 

one drive transmission rod (13), the device having a 
hollow body (11,33) which receives and supports the 

control mechanism (12), the rod (13) and the hooks (14) 
and which is provided with fixing means (36,37,38) 

adapted to fix the hollow body (11,33) to the piece of 
furniture; such a device (10) may be mounted simply and 

quickly on the piece of furniture either manually or by 
automatic equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a mechanical closure 
device for application in particular to furniture and the 
like for holding a door closed, comprising a control 
mechanism which operates the hooks which hold the 
doors closed through at least one drive transmission rod according to the preamble of claim 1 (CH-A-359618). A mechanical device for holding a door, or a pair of 
doors, of a piece of furniture closed is known in which 
a control mechanism, normally key operated, actuates two 
rods which extend in opposite directions and carry 
respective hooks at their free ends which hold the door 
or pair of doors closed. The control mechanism and the two rods with the hooks are 
normally mounted on the door or, in the case of a pair of 
doors, on one of the two doors of the piece of furniture. 
Two pins are fixed to the fixed frame of the piece of 
furniture and are engaged respectively by the two hooks 
to hold the door or pair of doors closed. In order to mount the closure device, the control 
mechanism is first screwed to the door, then the two rods 
are coupled to the control mechanism, these rods being 
fixed to the door by brackets or equivalent elements 
which are screwed to the door, and finally the two hooks 
are fixed to the respective free ends of the two rods.  
 
It will well be understood that this mounting is 
laborious and hence requires a certain amount of time for 
it to be carried out. The mounting cost is thus 
considerable. Moreover, this mounting must be carried out manually and 
cannot be carried out by automatic equipment. Hence, the 
great benefit of automation, which would reduce the 
mounting costs considerably, is lost. The object of the present invention is to find a solution 
to these problems. This object is achieved by means of the features of claim 1. For a better understanding of the invention, a 
description is given below of one non-limitative 
embodiment illustrated in the appended drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 shows part of a mechanical closure device  
 
according to the invention in exploded perspective;  Figure 2 shows the device of Figure 1 completed and 
assembled and in its mounted position on a door of a 
piece of furniture;  Figure 3 is a longitudinal section through the 
device mounted on the door, with reference to Figure 2.   The illustrated closure device generally indicated 10 has 
a hollow body which comprises a hollow profiled member 11 
of substantially omega shape in section. The profiled 
member 11 receives and supports a control mechanism

<CLAIMS>
A mechanical hook-closure device (10) for 
application particularly to furniture and the like for 

holding doors (50) closed, comprising a control 
mechanism (12) which operates the hooks (14) which hold 

the doors (50) closed through at least one drive 
transmission rod (13), characterized in that it 

comprises a hollow elongated profiled member (11), 
having a seat (16) which receives the control mechanism 

(12), having an internal duct (17) which receives the 
entire rod (13), providing at its ends housing and 

supporting means (27,33,40) which partially house and 
rotatably support the hooks (14), and providing fixing 

means (36,37,38) for fixing the profiled member (11) to 
the piece of furniture. 
A device according to Claim 1, in which the control 
mechanism (12) rotates the rod (13) and is kinematically 

connected to the rod (13) through means (20,21) which 
transmit drive on perpendicular axes (X,Y). 
A device according to Claim 2, in which the drive 
transmission means comprise a bevel gear (20) fixed for 

rotation with the control mechanism (12) and a drive 
element (21) provided with a toothed sector (26) which 

meshes with the gear (20) and is provided with an axial  
  

 
through-hole (41) through which the rod (13) passes and 

engages it rotatably. 
A device according to claim 3, in which the control 
mechanism (12) has forks (25) which engage the drive 

element (21) and support it, the gear (20) being 
interposed and retained between the control mechanism 

(12) and the drive element (21). 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which 
two hooks (14) are fixed for rotation with respective 

ends of the rods (13) in correspondence with the ends of 
the profiled member (11). 
A device according to Claim 5, in which the housing and supporting means comprise a bush (27) 
and a closure member (33) fixed to each end of the 

profiled member (11), the rod (13) being inserted in the 
bushes (27) and a hook (14) being rotatably housed 

between each bush (27) and the respective closure member 
(33) such that its arcuate portion projects out through 

a slot (40). 
A device according to Claim 1, in which the profiled 
member (11) is substantially omega shaped in section with 

a flat wall (15) in which an aperture (16) is formed 
which constitutes the seat for the control mechanism 

(12).  
 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
or Claim 8, in which the control mechanism is constituted 

by a cylinder lock (12). 
A device according to Claim 3, in which the axial 
hole (41) in the drive element (21) and the rod (13) each 

have a section in the form of a circular segment and in 
which each hook (14) has a hole (30) with a profile in 

the shape of a circular segment in which the rod (13) is 
inserted. 
A device according to Claim 1, in which the fixing 
means include screws (37) which are inserted in holes 

(38) in the hollow body (11.27,33) and which are intended 
to be screwed into the door (50) of the piece of 

furniture. 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 10, in which 
the fixing means include at least one rib (36) intended 

to be inserted in a corresponding groove (52) in the door 
(50) of the piece of furniture. 
A device according to Claim 11, in which the rib 
(36) has a toothed profile.
