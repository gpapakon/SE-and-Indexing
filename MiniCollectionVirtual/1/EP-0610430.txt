<ABSTRACT>
A two-step analog-to-digital converter (300) and BiCMOS fabrication method to make the converter. The fabrication method provides pseudosubstrate isolation of digital CMOS devices from analog devices. The converter uses NPN current switching in a flash analog-to-digital converter (306) and in a digital-to-analog converter (310) for low noise operation. CMOS digital error correction (318) and BiCMOS output drivers (320) provide high packing density plus large output load handling. Timing control (330) aggregates switching events and puts them into intervals when noise sensitive operations are inactive. The fabrication method uses a thin epitaxial layer with limited thermal processing to provide NPN and PNP devices with large breakdown and Early voltages. Laser trimmed resistors provide small-long term drift due to dopant stabilization in underlying BPSG and low hydrogen nitride passivation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic semiconductor devices and methods of
fabrication, and, more particularly, to integrated circuits with subcircuit isolation,
methods of isolation in an integrated circuit and integrated circuit fabrication
methods.Digital processing and transmission of electrical signals has become commonplace
even for basically analog information. Examples range from handheld digital voltmeters
to the transition beginning in the 1960s of the public long distance telephone network from
analog transmission to pulse code modulation (PCM) digital transmission. Application of
digital methods to analog information requires an analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, and
the linearity, resolution, and speed of such conversion depends upon the application. For
example, digital voltmeters usually call for AID conversion with good linearity and
resolution (18-bits) but which may be slow (1 Hz); whereas, video applications demand
high speed (30 million samples and conversions per second) but tolerate low resolution (8-bits)
and poor linearity. Intermediate requirements of 12-bit resolution, good linearity, and
3 Msps (million samples per second) speed appear in applications such as medical imaging
with ultrasound, robotic control, high speed data acquisition, process control, radar signal
analysis, disk drive head control, vibration analysis, waveform spectral analysis, and so
forth. Multichannel information acquisition with arrays of AID converters leads to another
requirement: small aperture jitter so that synchronism of the channels can be maintained.Well known types of A/D converters include the successive approximations
converter which produces a digital output by a succession of trial-and-error steps using a
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the flash converter which compares an input signal
to multiple reference levels simultaneously and outputs a digital version of the closest
reference level in a single step. The successive approximations converter provides high
resolution and linearity but with low conversion speed, and the flash supplies high speed
at the cost of resolution and linearity. Note that a flash converter with n-bit resolution
typically has a voltage divider with 2n taps and 2n comparators, and this becomes unwieldy
for high resolution. See, however, copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 696,241, 
filed May 6, 1991 and assigned to the assignee of the present application. A compromise
between these two types is the two-step flash A/D converter which uses a first
