<ABSTRACT>
A memory card comprises a metallic top cover, 
metallic bottom cover and frame housing a PC board and 

electrical connector. The top and bottom covers are 
joined by mechanical attachment to the frame and are 

grounded together by electro-mechanical connection and 
provide for grounding between the PC board and the 

covers. Mechanical latching mechanism provides for easy 
assembly of frame and covers by all vertical assembly. 

Integral spring tabs provide grounding of PC board and 
provide frictional pressure against PC board to provide 

stability of assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a housing for an integrated circuit memory
card.IC cards and mating sockets of free insertion and
withdrawal capability having the capabilities to store
large amounts of information and enact logical and
calculating functions and have been developed to comprise
thin, card-like plastic and metallic outer package which
house a frame and a semiconductor/integrated circuit
device and an electrical connector for electrically
connecting the semiconductor device to external
equipment. Such devices will be referred to hereinafter
as memory cards. The memory cards have found widespread
use as storage devices for data and programs for video
games and microcomputers. A conventional memory card has
a plastic and metallic outer package consisting of an
upper section and a lower section and a frame. The two
sections package, surround and protect integrated circuit
devices on a printed circuit (PC) board. EP-A-0452553 discloses a memory card housing having a frame
supporting a memory card, an aluminium cover covering the top of the
frame and a printed wiring board covering the bottom of the frame.US-A-5014160 discloses an apparatus for shielding part of a circuit
board, the apparatus comprising a top cover covering the top of the
shielded part, and a bottom covering the bottom of the shielded part.
Fingers of the apparatus are received in apertures in the circuit board to
provide electrical connection between the board and apparatus.It has been known in the art to secure the upper and lower sections
of a memory card housing to one another by applying a viscous bonding
agent to the connecting surfaces and pressing the surfaces of one package
section against the connecting surface of the other package section.
Connecting the top and bottom sections using adhesives is time consuming
and can become problematic when the adhesive leaks or runs onto the PC
board. If is important in these memory cards to provide a grounding
means. Such grounding has been achieved by bonding tabs between the
frame and the PC board. Such grounding is very expensive due to the
assembly required in order to solder the PC board during 
manufacturing.In order to solve this problem, this invention provides a memory card housing as set out in claim 1. Preferably, the housing
includes an all-metallic top cover and bottom cover
having integral ground clips, integral snap-locking means
for vertical assembly, an integral PC board locking
feature, grounding means between the top and bottom
covers, integral grounding means between
