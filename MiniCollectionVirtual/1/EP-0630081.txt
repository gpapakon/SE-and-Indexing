<ABSTRACT>
A double-sided connector for connection to an electrical cable, 
comprising two connector parts with the backs facing one another. The 

connector parts are provided with connector contacts which are accessible 
at the front, a positioning means for receiving and positioning the ends 

of the cable cores and connecting means for connecting the connector 
contacts of at least one of the connector parts to the conductors of the 

cable cores. The connector parts are provided at the back with pin contacts 
and socket contacts, respectively, which extend perpendicularly to 

said backs and can be mutually inserted and which are each connected to 
the corresponding connector contacts of the associated connector part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a double-sided connector for 
connection to an electrical cable, comprising two connector parts with 
the backs facing one another and provided with connector contacts which 
are accessible at the front, a positioning means for receiving and positioning 
the ends of the cable cores and connecting means for connecting 
the connector contacts of at least one of the connector parts to the 
conductors of the cable cores. Such a connector is disclosed in US Patent Specification 
4,431,249. In the known connector, the connector contacts are connected to 
one another and to respective cable conductors. For this purpose, a 
positioning means in the form of a separate positioning block is present. 
The ends of the cable cores are received and positioned in said 
positioning block. The two connector parts are provided with connecting 
means which are designed as insulation-removing contacts which are 
electrically connected to the corresponding connector contacts. During the assembly of the connector, the two connector parts 
are pressed onto the positioning block with the back facing one another, 
in which process the insulation is removed from the cable conductors by 
the insulation-removing contacts and, in doing so, contact is made 
between the cable conductors and the connector contacts of the two 
connector parts. The connector parts pressed onto each other are enclosed 
in a two-part housing with the separate positioning block in between. The object of the invention is to provide a connector of the 
type mentioned at the outset which is simpler and cheaper to construct 
and which can be assembled more easily. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the 
connector parts are provided at the back with pin contacts and socket 
contacts, respectively, which extend perpendicularly to said backs and 
can be mutually inserted and which are each connected to the 
corresponding connector contacts of the associated connector part. This achieves the advantage that, as a result of using the 
insertable pin contacts and socket contacts, respectively, only one of 
the connector parts needs to be provided with connecting means for 
connecting the connector contacts of the connector parts to the 
conductors of the cable cores. This has the result that the positioning 
means can be of simpler design.  
 The embodiments which are preferably to be used are described 
in the subordinate claims. The invention will be explained in greater detail below by 
reference to the drawings,

<CLAIMS>
Double-sided connector for connection to an electrical cable, 
comprising two connector parts (1, 2) with the backs facing one another 

and provided with connector contacts (6, 10) which are accessible at the 
front, a positioning means (16) for receiving and positioning the ends of the 

cable cores (14) and connecting means (12) for connecting the connector contacts of 
at least one of the connector parts to the conductors of the cable cores, 


characterized in that
 the connector parts (1, 2) are provided at the back 
with pin contacts (11) and socket contacts (7), respectively, which 

extend perpendicularly to said backs and can be mutually inserted and 
which are each connected to the corresponding connector contacts (10 and 

6, respectively) of the associated connector part. 
Connector according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, for the 
electrical connection between the connector contacts and the cable 

conductors, only one of the connector parts is provided with insulation-removing 
contacts (12) for removing the insulation of the positioned 

cable cores (14) and making contact with conductors of said cores, which 
contacts extend perpendicularly to the back face of the connector part 

concerned and are electrically connected with the connector contacts (6, 
7) thereof. 
Connector according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 one 
connector part is the connector part provided with the socket contacts. 
Connector according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
socket contacts at the back of the connector part are provided with two 

insulation-removing contacts (12) extending at a distance from one 
another. 
Connector according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
positioning means is formed by slots (16) in the back of the connector 

part which is not provided with the connecting means. 
Connector according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the slots 
are bounded by projections (17) projecting from the back of the connector 

part. 
Connector according to one of the preceding claims, in which 
the connector parts are received back-to-back in a common housing (3), 


characterized in that
 the connector parts are received insertably in the 
one-part housing from two mutually oppositely situated sides thereof and 

in that at least one of the connector parts can be locked in the housing. 
Connector according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the 
connector part provided with the insulation-removing contacts (12) has,  

 
on two mutually oppositely situated sides extending in the push-in 

direction of the connector part, an open recess in the said push-in 
direction for receiving a guide pin (20), extending in the same 

direction, of the housing, and also locking projections (18) which fit
