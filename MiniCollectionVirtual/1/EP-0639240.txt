<ABSTRACT>
Gelatin capsules containing oil field chemicals, preferably weighted with a heavy metal compound, are made more stable under certain conditions by the incorporation of a strong chelating agent. The microcapsules can provide an extended treatment period since many materials that would damage the microcapsules are controlled by the chelating agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and processes for 
treating oil wells. Conditions which adversely affect the production of oil from 
a well include: (1) the deposition of plugging materials brought 
out during production (e.g., formation of "scale"); and (2) 
corrosion of the well tubing and operating equipment in the well. 
Treatment of a well by introducing an oil field chemical can 
increase the rate of production, prolong the producing life, and 
lessen the deterioration of well equipment. However, it is difficult to treat the individual wells which 
are widely dispersed geographically, which are inaccessible 
during operation, and which contain fluids of widely varying 
composition. One moderately successful approach is disclosed in US-A-3,676,363, 
Mosier, issued July 11, 1972. 
The capsules disclosed therein 
are weighted. The capsules are deposited in the sump of a well 
where they slowly dissolve. Microencapsulation of various hydrophobic liquids is well 
known. Microcapsules have been suggested for encapsulation of 
perfumes, medicines, adhesives, dyestuffs, inks, etc. It has now been discovered that the walls of microencapsulated 
oil field chemicals of the type described in 
US-A-3,676,363, supra, 
are susceptible to damage, by many materials present in some 
ground waters, e.g., high brine contents and relatively large 
amounts of certain cations, and that, surprisingly, incorporation 
of strong chelating agent, like ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,  
 
stabilizes the capsule wall so that extended release of the oil 
well chemical is possible. The microcapsules according to the invention are defined in the appended claims. The strong chelating agents are incorporated into the microcapsules 
herein by addition to either the aqueous solution or the 
water-immiscible solvent used to form the microcapsules as described 
hereinafter. Useful chelating agents include the acid 
forms of compounds known to complex heavy metals. Many such 
compounds are used in detergent compositions, typically as their 
salts. Polycarboxylate materials useful herein, especially in the 
said preferred compositions, include the acid forms, or salts, of 
builders disclosed in US-A-4,915,854, Mao et al., issued 
Apr. 10, 1990, and US-A-4,704,233, Hartman and Perkins, 
issued Nov. 3, 1987. 
Suitable materials preferably have relatively strong 
binding constants for heavy metals under both acid and alkaline 
conditions. Preferred materials have the generic formula: 
R5-[O-CH(COOH)CH(COOH)]nR5 
wherein each R5 is
