<ABSTRACT>
A catalytic converter or diesel particulate filter or 
trap (10) has an edge protectant (34) which reduces erosion of a 

lateral edge (33) of an intumescent mounting mat (32) when exposed 
to hot, impinging gases. 

The edge protectant material comprises binder material in the range from about 
5 to about 85 percent by weight and dispersed therein glass particles in 

the range from about 95 to about 15 percent by weight, 
based on the total weight 

of said binder material and said glass particles, wherein said glass 
particles are made o
f a glass 
having a softening point of at least about 350°C, and wherein the 

combined weight of said binder material and said glass particles is at 
least 20 percent by weight of the total weight of said edge protectant 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catalytic converters and 
diesel particulate filters or traps as known from US-A-5 008 086. High temperature intumescent mounting mats are 
commonly used to hold monoliths (e.g., catalytic 
converter elements or diesel particulate filters) in 
place while resisting erosion of gases at moderate 
pressure pulsations and temperatures (typically less than 
about 750°C). For example, intumescent mounting mats do 
an adequate job of holding a ceramic monolith or diesel 
particulate filter in place with exhaust temperatures of 
less than about 750°C and with moderate pressure 
pulsations of exhaust gases such as are commonly 
encountered with six or eight cylinder engines. However, 
in high performance automobiles and heavy duty trucks, 
the intumescent mounting mat is typically subjected to 
higher temperatures and more severe pressure pulsations. 
Under these more severe conditions, over a period of 
time, the intumescent material making up the mat if left 
unprotected can be eroded. Solutions to the problem include the use of a 
stainless steel wire screen (U.S.-A-5,008,086) 
and braided or rope-like ceramic 
(i.e., glass, crystalline ceramic, or glass-ceramic) 
fiber braiding or metal wire material 
(U.S.-A- 4,156,333) to protect the edge of 
the intumescent mat from erosion by exhaust gases. It is the object of the present invention to provide 
a catalytic converter or diesel particulate filter having 
an improved edge protection of the intumescent mat from 
erosion.  
 The present invention provides a catalytic converter 
or a diesel particulate filter comprising a metallic 
casing, a catalytic converter element or a diesel 
particulate filter element disposed within the metallic 
casing, and a mounting mat disposed between the catalytic 
converter element or the diesel particulate filter 
element and the metallic casing for positioning the 
catalytic converter element or the diesel particulate 
filter element within the metallic casing and for 
absorbing mechanical vibration (i.e., at least partially 
damping mechanical vibrations), the mounting mat 
comprising: 
(a) an intumescent mounting mat having a 
lateral edge; and (b) an edge protectant material covering at 
least a portion of the lateral edge to 
reduce erosion of the lateral edge when 
exposed to hot, impinging gases (i.e., 
above about 300°C, preferably above about 
350°C, more preferably above about 500°C, 
and even more preferably above about 
750°C), the edge protectant material 
comprising binder material in the
