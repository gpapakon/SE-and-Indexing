<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a skin material laminated thermoplastic resin hollow molded body comprising 
the steps of; using inside one or both of a fixed mold and a movable mold a mold slidable in a mold clamping direction 

and having one or, two or more fluid discharging pins each having in turn a fluid discharging hole at their leading ends; 
fixing two skin materials having tension moduluses elasticity of 50 to 1000 kg/cm² and 5 to 100 kg/cm² at a normal 

temperature and a temperature of 80 °C, respectively, on respective parting surfaces of the both molds that are in an 
open state; supplying between the skin materials molten thermoplastic resin of 5 to 50 percent by volume relative to 

the cavity volume; carrying out first one of the processes of sticking out the fluid discharging pins to penetrate through 
one of the skin materials so that the leading ends thereof stay between the skin materials and closing the both molds 

so that molten thermoplastic resin is wrapped between the skin materials, and then carrying out the other process; 
discharging a fluid via the fluid discharging holes and tightly securing the skin materials and molten thermoplastic 

resin to the cavity surfaces of the molds while a hollow portion is being formed by virtue of the discharging pressure; 
effecting cooling while the above state is being maintained and stopping th e discharge of the fluid; and opening the 

both molds so that a hollow molded piece is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
a skin material-laminated hollow molded article of 
thermoplastic resin. A blow molding method, a gas injection molding 
method and the like are well-known as a process for producing 
a hollow molded article using a thermoplastic resin. However, in the skin material-lamination molding 
by a blow molding method, it is impossible to control the 
wall thickness of a skin material-laminated hollow molded 
article of thermoplastic resin, and hence, there is such a 
problem that it is difficult to obtain a molded article 
having a uniform and desired wall thickness. In addition, 
there are such many problems that the thermoplastic resins 
used are limited by their flow characteristics, viscosity 
and the like in the molten state and the shape of the molded 
article cannot respond to a shape having a high blow ratio. On the other hand, a gas injection molding method 
is known as a process for molding a thermoplastic resin 
hollow molded article which is hardly affected by the flow 
characteristics, viscosity and the like of the molten  
 
thermoplastic resin, capable of controlling the wall 
thickness and can respond to a shape having a high blow 
ratio; however, according to said method, it was difficult 
to produce a skin material-laminated molded article in which 
the skin material is an exterior decorative surface though 
said method was applicable to a process for producing a 
molded article consisting of only a resin without using a 
skin material. EP-A-0 322 285 discloses a process for producing a skin 
material-laminated hollow molded article of thermoplastic resin. Under such circumstances, the present inventors 
have made extensive research on a process for producing a 
skin material-laminated hollow molded article of thermoplastic 
resin in which the wall thickness is uniform and can 
be easily controlled without being subject to restriction of 
resin to be used and which can respond to a shape having a 
high blow ratio, and have, as a result, reached this 
invention. That is to say, this invention provides a process 
for producing a skin material-laminated hollow molded 
article of thermoplastic resin, using a mold having, in any 
one or both of its fixed and movable parts, one or two or 
more fluid-ejecting pins which can be slid in the clamping 
direction and have each a fluid-ejecting hole at its pointed 
end, which process consists of the following steps: 
(1) a step of fixing two sheets of skin material 
having a tensile modulus at ordinary
