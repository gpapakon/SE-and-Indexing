<ABSTRACT>
A specification is given of a device to detect and read transponders (T) which move relative to said device and carry information, said device selecting transponders to be read with respect to their distance and hence not being disturbed by reflections or undesired transponder responses from distance zones located closer by or further removed. Two phase modulators (PM1, PM2), of which one is arranged in the transmitting branch, the other in the receiving branch of the reading device, are driven with the same pseudo-random-code, the second phase modulator, however, being delayed in time. They form a propagation time filter, that is to say received signals reflected by a transponder or other objects are only evaluated if the sum of the propagation times of the transmitted HF signal and the signal reflected back to the reading device is approximately equal to the delay of the modulation signal fed to the second phase modulator. For further security with respect to an evaluation of transponder information from adjacent distance zones, additional propagation time filters for these adjacent distance zones can be provided and the evaluation can be carried out only for the case that no reply signal is received from one of the adjacent distance zones with a higher level. The device can be used in a stationary manner for reading transponders connected to moving objects or in a mobile manner, for example on trains for reading fixed route marks. If transponders are used which shift the reflected signal in terms of its frequency, interfering reflections of the interrogation frequency can be blanked out.
