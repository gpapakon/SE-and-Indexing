<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packing for 
liquid chromatography, and a process for producing the 
same. In particular, the present invention relates to 
a microspherical packing for liquid chromatography, 
which comprises a porous silicon carbide having 
numerous through-pores, and a process for producing the 
same. Packings or adsorbents used hitherto for liquid 
chromatography include those based on a silica gel such 
as ODS silica gel and those based on synthetic resins. Such silica gel-based packings are superior in 
that they have relatively high mechanical strength and 
high separation power. In addition, since they undergo 
only slight swelling or shrinkage in various organic 
solvents, they can easily be changed in use for 
analysis conditions with different eluents. However, 
they have defects that they are poor in chemical 
resistance in alkaline and acidic regions and are also 
poor in thermal resistance. On the other hand, although such synthetic 
resin-based packings have high chemical resistance,  
 
they are defective in that they have low mechanical 
strength and they are swollen or shrunk in a solvent 
due to their low solvent resistance thereby to make it 
difficult for them to change in use for analysis 
conditions with different eluents. Carbonaceous packings are also known as packings 
for conventional liquid chromatography. The 
carbonaceous packings are chemically stable and have 
high mechanical strength and such features that ODS 
silica gel and the like do not possess, since the 
carbonaceous packings are covered on their whole 
surface with π-electrons. However, the carbonaceous 
packings have strong power of adsorbing particularly 
polycyclic aromatic compounds since they are covered 
with π-electrons as described above, and, therefore, 
they have defects that they will cause an elution time 
to be prolonged too much depending on samples used to 
be chromatographed, will cause remarkable tailing to 
occur, or will cause the elution to become impossible. The present invention aims at solving the above-mentioned 
problems of the prior art, and an object of 
the present invention is to provide packings or 
adsorbents for liquid chromatography which have 
excellent chemical, thermal and solvent resistances, 
also have an non-excessive active surface and are 
capable of separating rapidly without fail even any  
 
samples, particularly protein or a compound having π-electrons 
such as a polycyclic aromatic compound, 
without too tightly adsorbing the sample onto their 
surfac
