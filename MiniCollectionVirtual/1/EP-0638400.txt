<ABSTRACT>
A press for pressing plate-like work pieces especially made of wood or wood-like materials has at least two press chambers (5, 6) arranged one above the other, of which each press chamber (5, 6) is situated between a fixed pressing table (2, 3) and a lifting table (4) movable relative thereto in the pressing direction. The movable lifting table (4) is driven by lifting cylinders (7) supported by thrust bearings fixed to the frame. The particular feature of this press resides in the fact that in each case a first press chamber (5) and a second press chamber (6) are situated between an upper fixed pressing table (2) and a lower fixed pressing table (3) and these two press chambers (5, 6) are separated from one another by a lifting table (4) arranged therebetween. Consequently, the two press chambers (5, 6) can be alternately opened and closed via the lifting cylinders (7) connected to the lifting table (4).

Press for pressing board-like workpieces, especially workpieces made
of wood or wood-like materials, such as furniture boards, door leaves or

parquet boards, having at least two pressure compartments (5,6) arranged
above one another, each pressure compartment (5,6) being located between a

fixed pressing table (2,3) and a lifting table (4) which is movable
relative thereto in the direction of pressing, the movable lifting table

(4) being driven by lifting cylinders (7) frame-integrally mounted in
thrust bearings, 
characterised in that
 a first pressure compartment (5) and
a second pressure compartment (6) of each pair of compartments are located

between an upper fixed pressing table (2) and a lower fixed pressing table
(3) and these two pressure compartments (5,6) are separated from each other

by a lifting table (4) arranged between them and are alternately opened and
closed by means of the lifting cylinders (7) that are connected to the

lifting table (4).
Press as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the lifting
cylinders (7) are double-acting cylinders and are oriented upwards from the

lifting table and/or downwards towards the machine frame (1).
Press as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the lifting
cylinders (7) are arranged outside and at the side of the lifting table (4)

and at least one of the pressing tables (2,3).
Press as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

above the upper pressing table (2) or below the lower pressing table (3)
there is a third pressure compartment (10) which is bounded by a second

lifting table (9) arranged above or respectively below it and driven by
means of lifting cylinders (11) frame-integrally mounted in thrust

bearings.
Press as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 each pair of fixed
pressing tables (2 and 3) with two pressure compartments (5 and 6) located

between them and separated from each other by a lifting table (4) forms a
first press unit and such a press unit supplemented by the third pressure

compartment (10) and the second lifting table (9) forms a second press
unit, and at least two of these first and/or second press units are 

arranged above one another, press units adjoining the sides of the fixed
pressing tables each having a single pressing table (2.3) in common.
Press as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that

the individual pressure compartments (5.6,10) are divided by means of
partitions (8) into two or more levels.
