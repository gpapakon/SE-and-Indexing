<ABSTRACT>
The improved beam scanning apparatus has an optical element 
(3) that is driven to rotate by means of a drive means so as 

to be capable of continuous angular displacement with respect 
to the beam from a light source (1). The optical element (3) 

deflects the incident beam so that it is focused to form 
image on the image plane (5). It is provided with an entrance 

face (S₁), a reflecting face (S₂) and an exit face (S₃) which 
have their shape specified in such a way as to achieve 

effective correction of aberration, provide higher 
resolution, and reduce the size and cost of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a beam scanning apparatus for
use with a laser beam printer and like devices.The beam scanning apparatus for use with laser beam
printers and like devices are so adapted that an optical beam
issuing from a light source such as a semiconductor laser and
collimated by means of a collimator lens is deflected for
scan by means of a fast driven rotating polygonal mirror and
focused by an imaging lens to form a beam spot that illuminates
an image plane to scan it for exposure. A problem with
this type of beam scanning apparatus is that the imaging lens
is so expensive that it accounts for most of the cost of the
overall system. In addition, the imaging lens is usually as
large as 100 mm in diameter, making the system inevitably
bulky. As a further problem, the polygonal mirror is not only
expensive but also bulky (i.e., its inscribed circle is usually
about 20 mm in radius); this contributes to an inevitable
increase in the cost and size of the whole system.With a view to solving these problems, the Japanese Patent
Application No. 
Hei 5-121995 discloses a beam scanning
apparatus of a type having an optical element that was
driven to rotate by means of a drive means so as to be
capable of continuous angular displacement with respect to
the beam from a beam generator, said beam performing
scanning by being focused on an image plane, which
apparatus was characterized in that the optical element was
provided with an entrance face, a reflecting face and an
exit face, at least one of which had the ability to correct
aberrations. In this apparatus, the beam deflecting
optical element (which is hereunder referred to as a
"rotating lens mirror") has its reflecting face serve as a
deflector but, at the same time, the individual faces can
also function as lenses, thus providing a certain degree of
freedom in correcting aberrations. In other words, the
single rotating lens mirror work as both a deflector and a
lens, whereby the beam scanning apparatus corrects
aberrations by a sufficient degree to assure satisfactory
optical characteristics.Speaking of the rotating polygonal mirror which
is also used with conventional laser beam printers, its
individual faces usually involve errors in parallelism that
develop in the process of its manufacture and, furthermore,
a mounting error can occur when it is mounted on the
rotating shaft. On account of these errors, the direction 
of travel of a reflected beam will change in a plane normal
to deflecting faces, thereby causing unevenness in the
scanning
