<ABSTRACT>
The impact clutch (10) has a reciprocating piston (22) which, if there is a speed difference between drive shaft (12) and driven shaft (21), carries out a stroke movement in the axial direction which is forced by a forced control device (28). The reciprocating piston (22) can be subjected, during its stroke movement, to a mechanically acting resistance in such a way that via the cams (34) of the forced control device (28) an angular momentum is transmissible in the circumferential direction to the reciprocating piston (22) and via the driving device (53) to the driven shaft (21). The mechanically acting resistance is formed by a pressure medium situated in a pressure chamber (24). The impact clutch according to the invention is suitable in particular for the generation of angular momentum in impulse screwdrivers.
