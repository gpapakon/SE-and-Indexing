<ABSTRACT>
A system is described which links by means of a pair of 
lines the command signals in square wave form from a unit 

broadcasting such command signals to an operating unit lying 
a long distance away so that since the signals are sent at a 

low voltage of about 36V and a frequency of about 1 kHz, they 
are enough after being stored in top quality capacitors to 

provide power to the operating point at said operating unit, 
without there being any need to stop power supply when 

signals are being sent, as used to happen in the previous 
system. Such system is particularly suitable for the 

transmitting of operating signals and the receiving of 
information from a wellhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system to transmit power 
and signals between two points distant from one another, one 
of them to command and the other to do or to operate whereby 
the same conductor used to convey power is used to convey the 
commands for the operating units and to receive answers and 
information from the operating point. The invention also 
relates to a system which makes practically no difference 
between power and signals transmitted from either of the two 
points that are apart. This invention can be employed to control and monitor 
an undersea oil producing plant from a surface station. One of the usual ways of controlling oil producing 
plant from the surface has been to transmit both the power 
and the signals to operate moving parts (valves, retainers, 
flow diverters, etc.) along the same pair of wires while 
trying as much as possible to avoid interference between 
power and signal lines due to unwanted harmonics. This practice, however, has it drawbacks, for instance: 
(a) since the undersea oil producing rigs are being laid in 
ever deeper waters, power-carrying cables have to 
travel long distances and therefore resistance becomes 
greater, which means that relatively high voltages have 
to be employed (100 to 400V) and low frequencies (50 to 
60 Hz), which is not always desirable because high 
voltages lead to power leaks along such undersea cables 
and connectors; (b) signals sent out are usually of low amplitude and high 
frequency (typical figures being a few mV up to 5V and 
1 to 10 kHz) in order to avoid the appearance of 
harmonics in the power lines which would affect signals 
transmitted and make them difficult to read, and which 
would otherwise call for powerful and efficient filters 
to separate power from signals, which filters are 
expensive, bulky and complex and therefore not always 
as reliable as might be wished. The conveying of power and signal currents along the  
 
same pair of wires but at greatly different frequencies is 
known as frequency multiplexing. Another system has been proposed in which power is 
transmitted as square waves at typically 36V and 50 Hz and 
signals are conveyed, for instance, at 3V and 1 kHz, just one 
pair of conductors being used for both power and signals. As 
mentioned, although the voltage applied is low compared with 
the usual method referred to before, and the square waves 
used to convey power being very efficient when resistance in 
the interconnecting cable is very high, this method suffers 
from the drawback that

An integrated power and signal transmission 
system, for joining a signal control and emission station to 

a remote operating station that receives said controlling 
signals so that the signals sent out by the signal control 

and emission station reach the points to be controlled by the 

operating station for allowing simultaneous return of 
information back to said control and emission station, 

characterized in that said system consists of an electronic 
unit comprising a modem with a modulated source which 

receives signals from the control and emission station and 
which then communicates with an electric distribution unit, 

which electric distribution unit is connected to an electronic 
unit (1) enclosed in a housing and containing: boards 

(2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) for carrying electronic components to 
manipulate said signals; transformers (8); electric 

distribution units (7); capacitors (9, 10, 11); said 
electronic unit (1) being adapted to send out modified 

signals from the modem and the modulated source to a matrix 
of diodes which distributes said signals to the operating 

points, the signal sent out being a squarewave of about 36V 
to about 100V and its frequency about 1 kHz, from the 

broadcasting unit and being sent along a single pair of 
conductors, so as to provide power and signals to work the 

operating system. 
An integrated power and signal transmission

controlling unit to the operating unit is at a voltage of 36V 
and a frequency of 1070 Hz and 1270 Hz. 
An integrated power and signal transmission 
system as in claims 1 and 2, wherein the signal broadcasting 

unit lies on an offshore oil producing platform and the 
operating unit that receives said signals lies next to the 

operating assembly or parameter reading unit which parameters

system as in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said boards with their 

electronic components (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) are arranged over 
one another and a given distance away from one another so as 

to avoid any physical contact among them.

system as in claim 4, wherein board (5) lies further down in 

the overlying arrangement and is a blind board used merely 
for shielding purposes, while board (4) lying above the 

arrangement may carry a circuit for the transmitting of 
pressure and temperature signals or be a blind board used 

merely for shielding purposes.
