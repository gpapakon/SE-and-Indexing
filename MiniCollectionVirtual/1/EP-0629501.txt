<ABSTRACT>
Air bubbles entrapped within the cells (72) of an 
engraved applicator roller (58) are displaced from the 

cells by wiping the engraved surface (60) of applicator 
roller with the bristles of a brush (106). As the engraved 

applicator roller (58) rotates in contact with the liquid 
coating material in the doctor blade reservoir (82), the 

bristles of the brush (106) puncture the entrapped air 
bubbles and sweep the entrapped air away from the cells. 

The elongated brush (106), which extends from one end of 
the doctor blade head (88) to the other, blocks the 

transfer of dispersed air bubbles from the liquid material 
in the upper reservoir chamber (102B) above the brush to 

the lower reservoir chamber (102A) below the brush where 
the cells are being filled with the liquid coating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sheet-fed or
web-fed, rotary offset or flexographic printing press
equipment, and in particular to an improved coating
apparatus for supplying inks or protective and/or decorative
coatings from a reservoir to a plate cylinder or to a
blanket cylinder.Fluid metering or applicator rollers, commonly
referred to as "anilox rollers", are used in the printing
industry to transfer measured amounts of printing ink or a
protective and/or decorative liquid coating to a plate
cylinder or to a blanket cylinder. The surface of the
applicator roller is engraved with an array of closely
spaced, shallow depressions referred to as "cells". Ink or
liquid coating material flows into the cells as the anilox
roller turns within a reservoir. The engraved transfer
surface of the applicator roller is scraped with a doctor
blade to remove excess ink or liquid coating material. The
ink or liquid coating material remaining on the anilox
roller is contained within the cells. The plate cylinder
or blanket cylinder transfers ink or liquid coating
material from the cells of the anilox roller over all or a
portion of the surface of printed sheets or a web of
material, either plastic or paper, onto which the desired
image is imprinted. The anilox roller has a cylindrical surface and
may be constructed in various diameters and lengths
containing cells of various sizes and shapes. The volumetric
capacity of an anilox roller is established during
manufacturing and is dependent upon the selection of cell
size, shape and number of cells per unit area. Depending
upon the intended application, the cell pattern may be fine
(many small cells per unit area) for lower coating weight
jobs, for example UV coatings, or coarse (fewer large cells
per unit area) for applying a protective coating or an
adhesive coating to heavy stock.Applicator rollers are journaled for rotation
about an axis parallel with the rotary axis of a plate
cylinder or blanket cylinder. A doctor blade head is
extendable and retractable into and out of operative
engagement with the applicator roller. In the operative
position, the periphery of the applicator roller extends
into an elongated reservoir cavity within the doctor blade
head. The doctor blade head may have one, two or more
doctor blades which seal against the cylindrical anilox
surface and enclose the reservoir. Some doctor blades seal
against an ink roller to form the bottom of an ink reservoir,
while other doctor blades are used for doctoring the
thickness of the liquid film on
