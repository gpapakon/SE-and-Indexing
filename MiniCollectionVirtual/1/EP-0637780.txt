<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an illuminating system in 
an exposure apparatus used in the fabrication of 

semiconductor devices to transfer patterns on a reticle 
to a substrate or wafer. The illuminating system 

includes a diaphragm (20) in which an aperture is formed to 
suitably shape a beam of illuminating light. According 

to the invention a liquid crystal display panel (22) is used 
as the principal part of the diaphragm, and the display 

panel is driven by a control unit (32) so as to display a 
black-and-white pattern having a white region (26) that is 

transparent to illuminating light and serves as a beam 
shaping aperture. According to the particulars of the 

reticle patterns a selection can be made from several 
different aperture patterns registered in the control 

unit. Therefore, when the reticle is changed the 
diaphragm does not need to be replaced by another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an exposure apparatus 
which is used in the fabrication of semiconductor 
devices to reduce and transfer a pattern or patterns 
formed on a mask or reticle to a substrate or wafer 
coated with a photoresist layer, and more particularly 
to a diaphragm used in an illuminating system of the 
exposure apparatus. In a conventional apparatus for the aforementioned 
purpose, commonly called a stepper, the illuminating 
system includes an aperture diaphragm for suitably 
shaping a beam of illuminating light at a section 
between an optical integrator to uniformalize the light 
beam and a condenser lens through which a reticle is 
illuminated. The shape of the aperture of the diaphragm 
is variously designed according to the particulars of 
the patterns on the reticle. For example, when the 
illuminating system is of an oblique incidence type it 
is suitable to employ an annular aperture, and the ratio 
of the inner diameter of the annular aperture to the 
outer diameter, called shape factor, is determined 
according to the pitch of the patterns on the reticle. Therefore, when the reticle is changed to another 
reticle different in the particulars of patterns it is 
necessary to replace the aperture diaphragm by another. 
The replacement of the diaphragm is time-consuming and 
hence becomes a cause of lowering of the net working 
rate of the exposure apparatus. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an improved exposure apparatus for use in the  
 
fabrication of semiconductor devices to project a 
reduced image of reticle patterns onto a substrate such 
as a silicon wafer, the improved apparatus having a 
novel diaphragm in which the shape of an aperture can be 
varied according to the particulars of the reticle 
patterns. The invention provides an exposure apparatus having 
a light source which provides a beam of illuminating 
light, a diaphragm which is partly transparent so as to 
provide an aperture through which the light beam is 
shaped, a condenser lens arranged between the diaphragm 
and a reticle and a projection lens for projecting a 
reduced image of patterns on the reticle onto a 
substrate such as a wafer. According to the invention, 
the diaphragm comprises a liquid crystal display panel 
which can become partly opaque and partly transparent 
such that a transparent region of the panel serves as 
the aforementioned aperture and control means for 
driving the liquid crystal display panel so as to 
control the shape of the transparent region according to 
the
