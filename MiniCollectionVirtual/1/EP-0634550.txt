<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a sash-fastener closer (110) for fastening flaps, side panellings (118) and the like, which consists of an electrically conductive wall material provided with an insulating surface, in a housing opening, on a frame profile or on a door case (117). The sash-fastening closer (110), comprising a plug-through part (116) with flange (114) at one end and a sash-fastener tongue (132) fastened at the other end, is fixed axially on one side and, on the other side, can be rotated between an open position and a closed position, in which closed position the sash fastener (132) engages behind a frame strut of the frame profile, of the door case or of the housing opening or the like by means of its sash-fastener surface (124). According to the invention, the sash-fastener tongue consists of metal and forms a scraping tooth (129) which projects out from the sash-fastener surface and, during the closure movement, penetrates into the frame-strut surface (124), likewise consisting of metal or being electrically conductive, but being covered with a non-conducting or poorly conducting layer such as a coating, and produces an earthing contact between the sash-fastener tongue (132), on the one hand, and the frame strut (117), on the other hand.

<CLAIMS>
Sliding bolt lock (10, 110) for fixing flaps, side 
panels, for closing doors (18, 118) etc., which 

preferably consist of an electrically conducting wall 
material provided with a surface insulating layer such as 

painted steel sheet, for fixing in an opening in this 
wall material, the sliding bolt lock (10, 11) consisting 

of a push-through part (16, 116) with a flange (14, 114) 
and a part acting as an actuation shaft (20), which is 

fitted at one end with an actuation face and at the other 
end with a sliding bolt tongue (32, 132), and which 

axially fixes the sliding bolt tongue at one end and on 
the other end pivots it between an open position and a 

closed position in which closed position the sliding bolt 
engages on its slide surface (25) a frame strut (24) of a 

frame profile, a door frame, the housing opening (17) or 
the like, characterized in that the sliding bolt tongue 

(32, 132) is made of metal and forms a scraper tooth (29, 
129) projecting from the slider surface (25) in the 

direction of the frame strut (24), which in the closing 
movement (26) penetrates the frame strut surface (24) 

which is also made of metal or is made electrically 
conductive but which is coated with a non- or poorly 

conducting layer such as a layer of paint, and which 
provides an earthing contact between the sliding bolt 

tongue (32, 132) and the frame strut (24, 124). 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that the tongue (32) is electrically 

connected to the push-through part (12), and the push-through-part 
in turn is electrically connected to the 

electrically conductive wall material (18). 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that the sliding bolt tongue (132) has 

at least one further scraper tooth (38) which lies on the 
electrically conduc
tive wall material (118).  
 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the push-through part (12, 112) is 

held by means of a metal spring (e.g. 1332) in the 
opening of the wall (118) or the like. 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that the metal spring (132) forms at the 

same time the sliding bolt tongue. 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the housing is held by an earthing 

nut (19) in the opening of the wall (18). 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that from the inside edge area (37) of 

the opening to the support surface (36) of the sliding 
bolt tongue (32) on the push-through part (12) an 

electrical connection formed by a metal or spring part is 
provided. 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that the sliding bolt tongue in the area 

in which it is connected to the push-through part forms a 
notch (43) in which the sliding bolt tongue (132) can be 

pushed on to the push-through part, for example in 
grooves (39) formed by the former. 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterized in that the notch (43) in its entrance area 

(45) forms a constriction, which locks the sliding bolt 
spring (132) in its position pushed on to the push-through 

part (116). 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the sliding bolt spring (132) in 

the area of the notch (43) has a convexity (48) in the 
shape of a cylinder or a spherical shell, by which it is 

supported against groove walls (41) formed by the push-through 
part (116). 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 8, 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the other tooth (38) emerges from  

 
the edge of an opening (52), which is then fitted on to 

the notch area (43). 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in Claim 10, 
characterized in that one or more further teeth (138, 

238, 338) emerge from the outside edges (54) of the 
sliding bolt tongue in the area of the notch (43), 

particularly a convexity in the shape of a spherical 
shell. 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in any one of Claims 8 
to 12, characterized in that between the areas bearing 

the two teeth 9129; 38) a cranked portion (50) is 
provided. 
Sliding bolt lock as claimed in any one of Claims 8 
to 13, characterized in that the push-through part (116) 

made of metal or plastic has in its face a multi-edged or 
slotted recess (49) for accommodating an actuation tool.
