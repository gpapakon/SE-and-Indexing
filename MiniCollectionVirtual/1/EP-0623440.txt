<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method and a device (1) for providing 
(replicating) a patterned resyntetic resin
 relief (37) on the surface (25) of a glass 
substrate (27). For this purpose, a UV-curable acrylate lacquer (33) is applied to the 

surface (25), after which a transparent mould (3) having a relief (13) is rolled-off over 
the surface (25). By means of a UV light source (17) and an elliptic mirror (21), the 

lacquer is cured at the location of the focal line (23), thereby forming said relief (37). 
The relief (13) of the mould (3) is replicated on the glass substrate (27). The method 

described enables a relief of small dimensions (10 x 10 µm) to be seamlessly provided 
on a large flat surface (1 x 1 m), without being hindered by large release forces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of providing a patterned relief of cured 
photoresist on a flat substrate surface, said substrate surface being provided with a layer 
of a UV-light curable liquid photoresist, after which said photoresist is brought into 
contact with a UV light-transparent mould having a relief which is complementary to 
the patterned relief to be provided and is subsequently cured by exposure to a UV-light 
source, thereby forming said patterned relief, after which the mould is removed from 
the cured relief. The invention also relates to a device for providing a patterned 
relief of cured photoresist on a flat surface of a substrate. Such methods are used, for example, in the manufacture of flat screens 
for liquid crystal display devices (LCD and LC-TV) in which the patterned relief 
consists of the so-called black matrix between the colour filters. The method can also be 
used in the manufacture of patterned reliefs on screens of flat colour display tubes, such 
as flat cathode ray tubes and electron-fibre displays. Said method can further be used to 
provide a flat TV screen with a defined roughness in order to reduce reflections (anti 
glare). Such a method is known from Patent Abstracts of Japan JP-A-3-54569. In 
the known method, a drop of liquid photoresist is provided between a flat substrate and 
a flat mould, said mould having a patterned relief in the form of recessed areas which 
are complementary to the relief to be provided in the form of protruding parts. The 
mould and the substrate are pressed together causing the photoresist to spread out over 
the entire substrate surface. The photoresist is cured by exposure to UV light, exposure 
taking place through the substrate or through the mould. After the photoresist has been 
cured, the mould is removed from the substrate, leaving the complementary pattern of 
the relief of the mould in cured photoresist on the substrate. In literature, this known 
method is referred to as replication. The protruding parts of the relief formed have 
dimensions of, for example, 10 x 10 µm. Cured photoresist is also present between the 
protruding parts of the cured relief, said photoresist must be removed by a uniform 
etching treatment.  
 The known method has a number of drawbacks. The known method is 
unsuitable for providing a relief pattern on large surfaces of, for example, 1 x 1 m; it is 
limited to dimensions of maximally 30 x 30 cm. At larger dimensions, detaching the 
mould from the cured photoresist becomes problematic owing to

A method of providing a patterned relief of cured photoresist (37) on a flat 
substrate (27) surface, the substrate (27) surface being provided with a layer (33) of a UV-light 

curable liquid photoresist, after which the photoresist is brought into contact with a UV 
light-transparent mould (3) having a relief (13) which is complementary to the patterned relief to 

be provided and which is subsequently cured by exposure to a UV light source (17), thereby 
forming the patterned relief, after which the mould (3) of the cured relief (37) is removed,

with a tangent of the mould (3) to the substrate (27) surface, so that the photoresist is cured at 
the location of the second focal line (23), thereby forming a part of the patterned relief (37),
