<ABSTRACT>
An angioplasty balloon catheter (10) particularly 
adapted for ablation of a stenosis in vivo has a 

balloon (12) which may be inflated with a conductive 
contrast fluid (20) injected proximally to the 

balloon, and is furthermore metallized (22) on the 
outside of the balloon and catheter shaft. The 

balloon has piezoelectric properties, and may be 
excited by application of an ultrasonic signal across 

the balloon between the metallized surface and the 
contrast fluid. The catheter is guided by a centrally 

located guide wire (16) to the site of the stenosis. 
If the distal tip of the catheter shaft cannot pass 

through the stenosis, excitation of the piezoelectric 
balloon in a deflated state at the site of the 

stenosis causes ultrasonic hammering vibrations at the 
tip of the catheter shaft which ablate the stenosis. 

After the tip of the catheter has hammered its way 
across the stenosis, and while maintaining the 

ultrasonic excitation signal, the balloon is inflated 
to keep the vibrating balloon surface in contact with 

the stenosis. Unlike the case with other inflatable 
balloon catheters which simply press the stenosis 

against the blood vessel wall, the stenosis is broken 
up by ultrasonic vibrations and is carried away by the 

blood flow, minimizing the risk of re-stenosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention broadly relates to a catheter
for use in opening a stenosis in a coronary
artery or any other vascular vessel. In particular, the
invention relates to an inflatable balloon catheter
wherein the balloon also serves as a piezoelectric
generator of ultrasonic energy for breaking up the
stenosis.Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is
presently the primary therapy for certain forms of
atherosclerotic artery disease. The major application of
the procedure is in the coronary arteries, but the
procedure can also be used in peripheral arteries or any
vascular vessel. Atherosclerosis results in the
restriction and blockage of blood flow in arteries by an
accumulation in the blood vessel of a variety of
biological materials. Such restriction or blockage
results in oxygen deprivation of the tissue supported by
the blood supply. This deprivation and its effect,
angina, is referred to as "ischemia". If the blood
supply through the coronary artery is almost completely
or completely blocked for more than two or three minutes,
permanent damage to the myocardia or infarction and death
may result. The biological matter causing arterial
blockage (stenosis) may be plaque, or thrombotic,
calcific or fibrous matter or any combination thereof.Several methods are known in the art to dilate an
existing path through a stenosis and restore blood flow.
Balloon angioplasty requires the insertion into the blood
vessel and through the stenosis of a deflated balloon,
which is hydraulically inflated to stretch and compact
the stenosis material against the wall of the artery.
This procedure is somewhat effective; however, the 
incidence of re-stenosis is high, and in many cases by-pass
surgery must be undertaken. A confirmed attendant
risk associated with this procedure is subsequent
downstream embolism or clogging, which can be essentially
as serious as the most serious stenosis which the
procedure is designed to remedy.In order that the smallest possible stenosed
aperture may be crossed, conventional balloon catheter
designs call for a balloon having minimal profile
diameter in the deflated state. As a result, the balloon
wall thickness must be minimized, reducing the burst
pressure of the balloon. At the same time, however,
there is a growing demand for higher balloon burst
pressures to overcome the high resistance of some
biological materials in stenoses that are somewhat or
completely calcified.The need for a minimal profile diameter in the
deflated state also requires a minimization of the
catheter shaft tip
