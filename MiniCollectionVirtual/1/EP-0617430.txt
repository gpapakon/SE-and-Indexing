liquid nuclear fuel, more particularly, concerns a plutonium as same as 

transuranium elements, such as Np, Am, and Cm, annihilating 
thorium-molten 

salt nuclear power reactor with use of liquid nuclear fuel and a 
plutonium annihilating accelerator molten salt breeder reactor with use 

of 
liquid nuclear target blanket, wherein spaces of moderators (10,13) 

arranged in a 
nuclear reactor core are communicated with an uranium collecting 

unit (20), 
the spaces are filled with a liquid nuclear fuel composed of thorium Th 

and 
plutonium Pu, uranium ²³³ U is generated from the thorium Th, the 

generated ²³³ U is separated by the uranium collecting unit as needed, 
and plutonium Pu is 

added (4) in place of the uranium ²³³ U, thereby enhancing burning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of using a 
nuclear fission reactor with use of liquid nuclear fuel 
composed of thorium and plutonium, the reactor having 
moderators arranged in a nuclear fission reactor core and 
wherein uranium 233U is generated from the thorium of 
fertile material in the nuclear fuel. The inventor already disclosed an invention of the nuclear fission reactor 
with use of liquid nuclear fuel in the Japanese Patent Application No. 60-272165. 
The small-sized molten-salt nuclear fission reactor (MSR) of the preceding 
invention needs no replacement of graphite of moderators nor continuous 
chemical process in a simple structure, operation, and maintenance. In the 
reactor, the plutonium of the nuclear fuel is made to nuclear-fission to energy 
and at the same time, the neutrons produced by the fission converts the thorium 
to uranium to continue the reaction. Also, the inventor already disclosed another invention of the accelerator 
molten-salt breeder reactor (AMSB) of single fluid type in the Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 63-64754 (1511036), or GB 2098788 A. In this reactor, the target/blanket salt is 
a molten fluoride containing a great amount of ThF4 as parent material and 
233 UF4 , 235 UF4 , or 239 PuF3 as nuclear fissionable material. The 
target/blanket salt has a proton beam of around 1 GeV (1,000 MeV) irradiated 
thereon, and neutrons generated by the irradiation are made to be absorbed in 
Th, thereby breeding 233 U. The reaction is started with 235UF4 
or 239PuF3 and continued without adding fissile materials. 
From time to time salt is taken out from the reactor and 
replaced by the same amount of fresh salt, the fresh salt 
does not contain fissile materials. The extracted salt is 
purified and used in another, i.e. in a molten salt power 
reactor.  
 However, the plutonium obtained by reprocessing the waste nuclear warheads or 
used nuclear fuels has turned into a grave social and environmental problems 
currently. In view of solving the foregoing problem of the prior arts, it is an object 
of the present invention to improve the methods of using reactors the previous (MSR) with a use of liquid 
nuclear fuel in order to effectively annihilating such a hazardous plutonium as nuclear fuel by way of changing the practice of fuel cycle and also changing the 
reactor construction a little as needed. Briefly, this object is accomplished in accordance with 
aspects of the present invention by in a MSR with use of liquid nuclear fuel wherein 
the spaces of the
