<ABSTRACT>
A turbo-charger in which a turbine wheel located in a turbine 
chamber is driven by an exhaust gas flow. A bypass passageway (6,8,9) 

extends around the chamber to enable exhaust gas to be diverted away 
from the turbine wheel. A valve (5) is mounted in the bypass passageway 

(6,8,9) and controlled so as to selectively open and close the 
passageway (6,8,9). 

The passageway (6,8,9) opens into the outlet (3) in a direction such 
that gas 

issuing from the passageway (6,8,9) is directed parallel to the 
direction in 

which gas flows through the outlet (3) from the turbine chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a turbo-charger, and in particular to a turbo-charger
provided with a bypass passageway through which exhaust gas can be
diverted away from a turbine wheel.Turbo-chargers are known which comprise a turbine housing defining a
turbine chamber, an exhaust gas inlet to the chamber, an exhaust gas outlet from the
chamber, and a passageway which extends between the inlet and outlet and bypasses
the chamber. A valve is mounted in the passageway and controlled to selectively
open and close the bypass passageway. Such arrangements are provided to enable
excess exhaust gas to be delivered to the turbo-charger outlet.In the known turbo-chargers, such as that disclosed in US patent no.
4,075,849, the bypass passageway opens into a relatively large side pocket which
communicates with the turbine outlet. Thus, when exhaust gas flows through the
bypass into the pocket it discharges into the exhaust flow generally at right angles to
the direction of gas delivered to the outlet from the turbine chamber. This disturbs the
flow of gas through the outlet, thereby increasing back pressure and reducing turbine
efficiency. Even when the bypass is blocked by the valve, the efficiency of the
arrangement is reduced because the relatively large pocket opening into the turbine
outlet disturbs the flow of gas.In some known turbo-chargers exhaust gas discharged from the bypass
passageway is deliberately introduced into the main exhaust gas flow from the turbine
chamber in order to produce a "jet" effect to reduce pressure behind the turbine. An
example of such a turbo-charger is disclosed in British patent number GB 2 059 515.It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the problems
outlined above.According to the present invention, there is provided a turbo-charger
comprising a turbine housing defining a turbine chamber, an exhaust gas inlet to the
turbine chamber, an exhaust gas outlet from the turbine chamber, a passageway which
extends between the inlet and outlet and bypasses the chamber, a valve mounted in the
passageway, means for controlling the valve to selectively open and close the
passageway, characterised in that: 
(i) the passageway comprises an annular portion which communicates at
its upstream end with a chamber defined around the valve and opens at its
downstream end into the outlet in a direction such that gas issuing from the
annular portion of the passageway is directed substantially parallel to the axis
of the turbine in which direction gas flows from the

A turbo-charger comprising a turbine housing defining a turbine chamber, an
exhaust gas inlet to the turbine chamber, an exhaust gas outlet (3,7;23,18;24,27) from

the turbine chamber, a passageway (4,6,8;14,16,20;33) which extends between the
inlet and outlet (3,7;23,18;24,27) and bypasses the chamber, a valve (5;15) mounted

in the passageway (4,6,8;14,16,20;33), means for controlling the valve (5;15) to
selectively open and close the passageway (4,6,8;14,16,20;33)
,
 characterised in that:

(i) the passageway (4,6,8;14,16,20;33) comprises an annular portion
(8;20;33) which communicates at its upstream end with a chamber (6;16)

defined around the valve (5;15) and opens at its downstream end into the
outlet (3,7;23,18;24,27) in a direction such that gas issuing from the annular

portion (8;20;33) of the passageway (4,6,8;14,16,20;33) is directed
substantially parallel to the axis of the turbine in which direction gas flows

from the turbine chamber through the outlet (3,7;23,18;24,27);
(ii) the annular portion (8;20;33) of the passageway is located coaxially
with and

radially outside a first portion (7;23) of the outlet (3,7;23,18;24,27) and opens
at a second portion (3;18) of the outlet (3,7;23,18;24,27) downstream of said

first portion (7;23);
(iii) the annular portion (8;20;33) of the passageway (4,6,8;14,16,20;33)
reduces in radial width towards its downstream end; and
(iv) the first portion (7;23) of the outlet tapers radially outwards towards
the downstream end of the annular portion (8;20;33) of the passageway

A turbo-charger according to claim 1, wherein the first portion (7) of the outlet
(3,7) comprises a tubular insert (7) which is located within an exhaust outlet pipe (3),

said annular portion (8) of the bypass passageway (4,6,8) being defined between the
tubular insert (7) and the outlet pipe (3), the tubular insert (7) having a downstream

portion ( I I ) which diverges radially outward to define said taper.
A turbo-charger according to Claim 1, wherein the annular portion (20) of the
by-pass passage (14,16,18) way is defined by a cover plate (17) secured to the turbine

housing, the cover plate being provided with radially inwardly extending struts (22)
supporting a radially inner wall (23) of the cover plate (17), the wall (23) defining an
