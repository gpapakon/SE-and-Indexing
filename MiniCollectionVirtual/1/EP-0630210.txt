<ABSTRACT>
A flexible elongate tubular member (12) of a suitable material such as plastic. It is provided with proximal and distal extremities (13 and 14). The member (12) is sized so that it can accommodate a guide wire (21) of a conventional type. The side arm (41) can be used for introducing radiopaque liquids. A predetermined bend (46) is provided in the distal extremity (14) of the member (12). A plurality of ultrasonic transducers (T1, T2, T3 and T4) are carried by the distal extremity of the catheter near the bend (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
 VASCULAR CATHETER FOR MEASURING FLOW CHARACTERISTICS AND METHODThis invention relates to a vascular catheter for measurement of flow characteristics and method and more particularly to such a catheter which is incorporated into an angiographic catheter or alternatively into a guiding catheter-Catheters for continuouslymeasuring flow characteristics such as volumetric blood have heretofore been disclosed as for example in Patent No. 4,947,852 and 5,078,148. The catheter disclosed in the '852 patent is particularly adapted for use in the right side of the heart in the pulmonary artery. It is provided with a latex balloon which when inflated is adapted to plug the pulmonary artery in which the catheter is disposed. During cardis-c catheterization laboratory procedures on the left or high pressure side of the heart, such as coronary angiography. It is at times desirable to obtain an assessment of cardiac flow characteristics. In order to obtain these measurements, it is necessary to introduce a catheter such as that disclosed in the '852 patent into the right side of the heart. This requires the use of an additional catheter and an additional physician's time for making such measurements. There is therefore a need for a new and improved vascular catheter for measurement of flow characteristics and method which . overcomes these disadvantages.In general it is an object of the present invention to provide a vascular catheter for the measurement of flowSUBSTITUTESHEET 

characteristics and a method for evaluating total cardiac output during coronary catheterization.Another object of the invention is to provide a vascular catheter and method of the above catheter in which substantially the entire blood flow output from the ascending aorta of the human heart is measured.Another object of the invention is to provide a catheter and method of the above character in which output is measured during systole.Another object of the invention is to provide a catheter and method of the above character in which separate velocity measurements can be made contemporaneously with flow measurements.Additional objects and features of the invention will appear from the following description in which the preferred embodiments are set forth in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.FIGURE 1 is a planview of avascular catheter formeasurement of flow characteristics incorporating the present invention.FIGURE 2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 2-2 of Figure 1.FIGURES 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E show typical bends
