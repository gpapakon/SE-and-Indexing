<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reasoning computer 
system, and more particularly to an improved reasoning 
computer system having a simplified construction and 
versatile applications. Discussion of the Related Art 
There is well known a fuzzy computer which produces 
a predetermined conclusion based on a predetermined 
fuzzy rule having an antecedent and a consequent 
and an input sinal aplied thereto. Accordingly, the 
conventional computer has the disadvantages that it is 
restricted by the predetermined fuzzy rule, a limited 
lattitude of reasoning, and lack of universality. It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention 
to provide a reasoning or inference computer 
system having an increased flexibility of reasoning and 
a broadened scope of uses. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide a reasoning computer system having a plurality 
of reasoning computers with a multi-stage construction 
so that a reasoning operation by a primary computer can  
 
be shared with its child computer. It is another object of this invention to provide 
a reasoning computer system having a simplified fuzzy 
computer construction. According to this invention, there is provided a 
reasoning or inference computer system in a multi-stage 
construction including a primary reasoning computer at 
a rank having a reasoning means for producing a reasoned 
result, at least one child reasoning computers at a 
lower rank having a reasoning means for producing a 
reasoning result, and a means for providing the reasoning 
results by the child reasoning computers to the 
reasoning means of the primary reasoning computer, 
whereby the reasoning by the primary reasoning computer 
is assisted by the child reasoning computers. According to another aspect of this invention 
there is provided a fuzzy reasoning computer system 
including a means for providing a membership function 
with pulse widths representing membership values 
corresponding to fuzzy variables. Other objects and advantages of this invention 
will become apparent from the following detailed 
description and accompanying drawings, in which: Fig. 1 shows a construction of a preferred  
 
embodiment of a system for executing a multi stage 
fuzzy reasoning according to this invention; Fig. 2 is a schematic construction illustrating an 
example of a reasoning process in the system of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a schematic block diagram of a fuzzy 
computer employed in the system of Fig. 1; Fig. 4 illustrates a memory map of a fuzzy rule 
storage employed in the computer
