<ABSTRACT>
A foot support for diabetes patients has a dimensionally stable basic body (1), a damping layer (2) extending thereabove made of an elastic material which is softer in relation to the basic body (1), and a foot-side covering layer (5). The basic body (1) is provided exclusively in the central foot region and designed in a banked manner over its entire width to relieve the forefoot and the heel. The covering layer (5) consists of a material which is softer still in relation to the damping layer (2) and which allows shear movements running in the plane of the covering layer (5).

Foot support, in particular insert for persons suffering 
from diabetes, consisting of a dimensionally stable base 

member (1), a damping layer (2), extending thereon, of an 
elastic material which is more flexible than the base member 

(1) and a foot-side covering layer (5) which allows shearing 
movements extending in the plane of the covering layer (5), 

characterized in that the base member (1) is provided 
exclusively in the central region of the foot and is raised 

over its entire width to relieve the front of the foot and the 
heel and in that the covering layer (5) consists of a material 

which is again more flexible than the damping layer (2) and 
allows the shearing movements extending in the plane of the 

covering layer (5) by material deformation. 
Foot support according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the covering layer (5) has flexibility comparable to the 

tissue surrounding the foot bone in healthy people. 
Foot support according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the covering layer (5) has a uniform thickness of about 5 

mm over the entire foot support. 
Foot support according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the covering layer (5) consis
ts 
of polyethylene foam or neoprene. 
Foot support according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the damping layer (2) consists 

of a highly resilient plastics foam.
