 substrate 
containing grooves, the sidewalls of which have an equivalent 

orientation to that of the substrate. This method is applied to the 
fabrication of an heterobipolar transistor and of 

a vertical field effect transistor (700) and with 
buried gates (704) having gate sidewall crystal orientation the same as 

the 
substrate surface and a low index substrate crystal orientation without 

tilt to 
a higher index direction. The gate (704) may have modulated doping along 

the channel (706), and the drain (708) may have a lighter doping level 
than 

the channel which may be accomplished by an epitaxial overgrowth of the 
gates (704) to form the channels (706).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electronic semiconductor devices and circuits,
and, more particularly, to methods of fabrication with epitaxial overgrowth
and to a vertical field effect transistor
of the type defined in the precharacterizing portion of
claim 9 and further to a heterojunction bipolar transistor.A semiconductor device of the type mentioned above is known
from EP-A-0 099 270. This document discloses a method for
the formation of buried gates in a semiconductor device
using epitaxial growing method combined with diffusion
method or diffusion by an additional heat treatment. The
buried gate has smaller gate resistance by providing
relatively high impurity concentration and also has good
reverse characteristic by providing relatively low impurity
concentration at the top of the buried gates.Various semiconductor processing flows include formation of epitaxial
layers on substrates. Such epilayers may provide a change in doping level, a
crystal structure superior to that of the substrate, or even a change in
material such as a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate with an aluminum
gallium arsenide (AlxGa1-xAs) epilayer for heterojunction devices. Epilayer
growth by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on {100}
oriented GaAs substrates produces smoother surfaces when the substrate
orientation is tilted 2° in the {110} direction, and industry standard GaAs
wafers have such an orientation tilt. This tilt rovides a slightly terraced
surface (terrace widths on the order of 0.01-0.02 µm (100-200 Å) which insures smooth
epilayer growth.Certain processing flows include epitaxial overgrowth of nonplanar
structures. In particular, silicon bipolar transistor processes frequently have
a buried layer formed by epitaxial overgrowth of a doped region which has
been depressed below the substrate surface by an oxidizing drive-in cycle.
But more significantly, heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) and self-aligned  
structure (SAS) lasers can be fabricated with epitaxial growth over
steps in a GaAs layer. See Plumton et al, Planar AlGaAs/GaAs HBT
