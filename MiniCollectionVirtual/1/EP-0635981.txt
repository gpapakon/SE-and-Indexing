<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is intended to exactly 
extract a feature-region along its contour line without 

erroneously extracting any moving object other than the 
feature-region. An extraction signal from a feature-region 

main-portion extracting circuit(1) is sent to a 
small region eliminating circuit (2) whereby an 

erroneously extracted small region is detected and 
eliminated as an erroneously extracted noisy 

portion. The small region eliminating circuit(2) 
compares a small region with four detection patterns, 

discriminates it as a region other than the feature 
face-region if no match is found and causes a center 

pixel of a window of 3 × 3 pixels to have a logical 
value of zero. An output of the small region 

eliminating circuit (2) is sent to a blank filling 
circuit (3) which compares its input with four 

detection patterns, discriminates it as a face-region 
if a match is found and makes a central pixel of a 

window of 13 × 13 pixels have a logical value of 1. The 
above-mentioned extraction method can reliably extract 

features of the face-region and is free from the 
erroneous extraction of any moving object other than 

the face.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feature-region
extraction method and a feature-region extraction
circuit and, more particularly, to a feature-region
extraction method and a feature-region extraction
circuit which are capable of extracting a feature-region
of an image for processing the image according
to its feature at a pre-processing portion of an image
coding device and which are intended to be used, for
example, in video telephone systems, video conference
systems and so on.In a motion picture coding and transmitting device
for a video telephone, since any transmission line has
a limited capacity to transmit a number of bits at a
time, it cannot allocate enough bits to an image
information. Accordingly, a decoded image may have
impaired picture quality with a mosquito-like
distortion, a block distortion and the like. On the
other hand, most of the images to be transmitted
include an important portion and less important
portions. On the basis of this fact, a method is
proposed that reduces the subjective deterioration of
image quality by keeping the important portion 
free from the ill effects of deterioration.For example, in systems such as a video telephone
system, the image of the face region is so important
that such systems have been directed towards
extracting the face region, preferentially allocating
the amount of information transmitted and making the
image quality of the face region better, aiming at
improvement of the subjective image quality.Prior art that is concerned with such subject
matter is disclosed in the publication "Color motion
picture coding device featured by preferentially
processing a face image" (Hideyuki Ueno, Image
Information vol. 24, March 1992, pp. 29-35). The face-region
extraction method of the prior art described in
the publication will be explained as follows.The prior art first determines the difference
between two neighboring frames of the motion picture
input to get the interframe differential image and
then divides the interframe differential image into
rectangular regions. In the respective rectangular
regions, the method makes a histogram representing the
number of pixels, in which the interframe difference
signal is larger than a certain threshold, on an H-axis.
The method scans the histogram from the left and the
right comparing its values with a certain threshold
"th" to detect the left and right ends of the moving 
region.The image screen is scanned from the upper left
end until a first moving region is found. This moving
region has a coordinate on a
