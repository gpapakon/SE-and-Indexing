<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brazing material used
for fabricating aluminum alloy heat-exchangers for automobiles
etc., an aluminum alloy brazing sheet for heat-exchangers
used as a constitutional component of aluminum
heat-exchangers, and a method for fabricating aluminum heatexchangers
using them. More specifically, it provides a
brazing material and brazing sheet for fabricating aluminum
alloy heat-exchangers with excellent thermal efficiency, high
strength and excellent corrosion resistance by brazing technique,
and a brazing method using them.There are a radiator, condenser, evaporator, etc. for
the heat-exchangers for automobiles. In the radiator there-among,
as shown in Fig. 1 for example, a thin-wall fin (2)
machined in corrugated shape is formed unitedly between a
plurality of flat tubes (1), both ends of said flat tubes (1)
open respectively in the spaces constituted by a header (3)
and a tank (4), a high temperature refrigerant is fed from
the space of one tank side to the space of other tank (4)
side through the flat tube (1), thereby heat-exchanging at
the portions of flat tube (1) and fin (2), and the refrigerant
having become lower temperature is circulated again.For the tube material and the header material of such
heat-exchanger, a brazing sheet is used, comprising, for
example JIS 3003 alloy (Al-0.15 wt. % Cu-1.1 wt. % Mn) core
material, cladded the inside of said core material or the
side always contacting with refrigerant with JIS 7072 alloy 
(Al-1 wt. % Zn) as a lining material and the outside of said
core material, ordinarily with brazing material such as JIS
4045 alloy (Al-10 wt. % Si), and this is assembled unitedly
together with the corrugated fin and other components by
brazing.Moreover, Fig. 2 shows a serpentine type condenser, in
which a tube material (5) formed tubularly by hot or warm
extrusion is folded serpentinely and a corrugated fin (6)
comprising brazing sheet is attached between the openings of
tube material. Besides, numeral (7) shows a connector. For
the tube material, JIS 3003 alloy etc. are used, and, for the
fin, JIS 3003 alloy or an alloy containing Zn etc. for the
purpose of giving the sacrificial effect thereto is used as a
core material, and a brazing material such as JIS 4045 alloy
or JIS 4343 alloy (Al-7.5 wt. % Si) is cladded on both sides.Furthermore, in Fig. 3, a multilayer type evaporator is
shown. In this evaporator, fin (2) and pathway-constituting
sheets (9) and (9') forming path ways (8) and (8') of refrigerant
and comprising brazing sheet
