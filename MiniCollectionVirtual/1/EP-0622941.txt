<ABSTRACT>
A public telephone system includes a plurality
of public telephone sets and a center apparatus. Each

public telephone set includes a memory for storing a
current tariff table used in the speech communication

service and a revised tariff table including the tariff
information from the center apparatus, a first timepiece

unit for setting the time information from the center
apparatus to perform a time counting operation, a first

data memory for storing the change time information from
the center apparatus, a determining unit for determining

whether a current time counted by the first timepiece
unit reaches a change time stored in the first data

memory at a time of call originating, and a tariff
processing unit for referring to the current tariff

table in the memory to perform the tariff processing
when the current time does not reach the change time and

referring the revised tariff table in the memory as the
current tariff table to perform the tariff processing

when the current time reaches the change time on the
basis of an output from the determining unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a public 
telephone system comprising a public telephone set (to 
be referred to as a telephone set hereinafter) and a 
center apparatus, in which a tariff table of the 
telephone set is revised by tariff change designation 
from the center apparatus. To change tariffs in a conventional public 
telephone system of this type, data such as tariffs to 
be revised or corresponding telephone numbers is 
converted into DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) signals 
and transmitted from a center apparatus to each 
telephone set at a predetermined time for change. Each 
telephone set receives and stores these tariff data in 
an internal memory. At the same time, subsequent speech 
communication in each telephone set is charged in 
accordance with tariff data of a new tariff system. In the conventional public telephone system, 
when the time for change of the tariffs is reached, the 
tariff data to be revised is transmitted from the center 
apparatus to each telephone set. In this case, since 
the center apparatus must transmit the tariff data to a 
large number of telephone sets, the telephone sets  
 
cannot be simultaneously changed to a new tariff system. 
Therefore, during change operation of the tariffs, 
speech communication in a given telephone set is charged 
in accordance with the new tariff system while that in 
another telephone is charged in accordance with the old 
tariff system. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a public telephone system for simultaneously 
changing the tariff system for a large number of 
telephone sets. In order to achieve the above object, there is 
provided a public telephone system comprising a 
plurality of public telephone sets for performing tariff 
processing as tariff payment processing for a speech 
communication service in accordance with tariff data 
obtained on the basis of a calling dial number, and a 
center apparatus for transmitting time information, 
revised tariff information, and change time information 
to the public telephone sets through a telephone line, 
each of the public telephone sets comprising memory 
means for storing a current tariff table used in the 
speech communication service and a revised tariff table 
constituted by the tariff information from the center 
apparatus, first timepiece means for setting the time 
information from the center apparatus to perform a time 
counting operation, a first data memory for storing the  
 
change time information from the center apparatus, 
determining means
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A public telephone system characterized by 
comprising: 

   a plurality of public telephone sets (10) for 
performing a tariff processing as tariff payment 

processing for a speech communication service in 
accordance with tariff data obtained on the basis of a 

calling dial number; and 
   a center apparatus (30) for transmitting time 

information, revised tariff information, and change time 
information to said public telephone sets through a 

telephone line, 
   each of said public telephone sets comprising 

      memory means (26A, 26B) for storing a 
current tariff table used in the speech 

communication service and a revised tariff 
table constituted by the tariff information 

from said center apparatus, 
      first timepiece means (27) for setting 

the time information from said center 
apparatus to perform a time counting 

operation, 
      a first data memory (25a) for storing the 

change time information from said center 
apparatus,
