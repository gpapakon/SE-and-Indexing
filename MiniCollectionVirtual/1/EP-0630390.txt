Copolyoxadiazoles of block type of 
formula : 


 
   in which: 


R represents an aliphatic residue, A an 
aromatic residue 
x is such that the inherent viscosity (measured 
in methanesulphonic acid at a concentration of 0.2 g per 

decilitre at 30°C) in decilitres per gram is greater than 
0.6 
n and n' are greater than or equal to 2 
 
   and having two glass transition temperatures. 
Products according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that n and n' are between 3 and 20. 
Products according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that R is a residue having 2 to 20 

carbon atoms. 
Products according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that A is the isophthalic or 

terephthalic acid residue or their mixture by removal of 
the COOH groups. 
Process for the preparation of the 
copolyoxadiazoles according to one of Claims 1 to 4,  

 
characterized in that 


(i) diacid HOOC-A-COOH is placed in contact with 
(ii) the dihydrazide: 

 
   or the
 
diacid HOOC-R-COOH 
(iii) in the presence of a sulphonic acid and 
phosphoric anhydride 
(iv) in the presence of an amount of hydrazine 
sulphate such that the number of moles of hydrazine plus 

the number of moles of dihydrazides is at least equal to 
the number of moles of diacids. 
Process according to Claim 5, charac-terized 
in that the sulphonic acid is methanesulphonic 

acid. 
Process according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the dihydrazides may be prepared in situ 

by reaction of the corresponding diacid and hydrazine 
sulphate.
