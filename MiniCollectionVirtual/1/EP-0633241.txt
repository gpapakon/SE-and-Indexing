<ABSTRACT>
Illustrated by the purification of diphenyl 
carbonate (DPC), diaryl carbonates are purified and 

freed of contaminants such as inorganic and organic 
chlorides, metal ions, iron components and color 

bodies. The process is a two-stage procedure 
starting with a water wash of the molten carbonate 

followed by distillation. In a preferred 
embodiment, crude DPC is charged to the wash tank 

and is washed in the molten state three times. 
Fresh steam condensate is used for each wash which 

consists of a period of agitation followed by 
decantation then water removal. After the third 

wash, the molten DPC is transferred to a still for 
distillation. The rag layer which is formed at the 

water/DPC interface during washing is purged and 
not allowed to pass through to the still. A flash 

distillation is carried out under constant vacuum. 
Three overhead cuts are taken - lights, 

intermediate and product DPC depending on the 
temperature of the overhead vapor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processes for the 
purification of diaryl carbonates such as diphenyl 
carbonate. Diaryl carbonates such as diphenyl carbonate 
may be prepared by a number of processes. For 
example, one process is based on the phosgenation 
of aromatic hydroxy compounds in the presence of a 
quaternary ammonium salt catalyst. A variant 
process comprises phosgenation at elevated 
temperatures in alkaline solution. A commercial 
process for production of diphenyl carbonate 
comprises phosgenation of phenol in the presence of 
caustic at a pH of 10-11 and at a temperature of 55°-60°C. SU-A-1698250 discloses the preparation of diphenyl 
carbonate by reaction of phenol with phenylethyl thiocarbonate 
in the presence of sodium carbonate in nonane. 
Ethanethiol is distilled off and the cooled reaction mixture 
is washed three times with water and dried over magnesium 
sulphate. The solvent distilled off and diphenyl carbonate 
product recrystallised from hexane. Commercial preparations of the diaryl carbonates, 
regardless of the process employed, inevitably contain 
various contaminant compounds in varying quantities. 
Examples of contaminants which have been identified are 
inorganic and organic chlorides, metal ions, iron compounds, 
acidic compounds such as aryl chloroformates and a range of 
compounds identified only as "color bodies". These contaminants 
frequently effect use of the diaryl carbonates in 
particular applications. For example, when their desired 
use is as a monomer reactant in the preparation of aromatic 
polycarbonate resins by transesterification (using bisphenol-A 
and diphenyl carbonate), presence of the contaminants can 
affect polymerization rates  
 
and resin color. The polymer product may have a 
low intrinsic viscosity (IV) and colors ranging 
from pink (iron contamination) to brown (phenyl 
chloroformate contamination). Although distillation of diaryl carbonates has 
been useful to remove color bodies and solves the 
problem of coloration in the carbonate and resins 
prepared from them, the procedure has not been 
useful to remove other contaminants responsible for 
inhibiting polymerization rates. In fact, a major 
drawback of distilled diphenyl carbonate is a loss 
of reactivity as observed in ester interchange 
reaction studies. The reason is open to speculation. 
Also, subjecting the diaryl carbonate, 
such as diphenyl carbonate, to distillation solely 
as a means of purification results in a percentage 
of product loss, which is an economic disadvantage. We have
