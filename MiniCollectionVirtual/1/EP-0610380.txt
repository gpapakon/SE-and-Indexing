<ABSTRACT>
The horn according to the invention is provided with a pressure tube, a membrane and a sound tube, wherein both the pressure tube and the sound tube are in connection with said membrane. The horn is characterized in that the membrane is streched out on the front face of the pressure tube, the sound tube is arranged within and coaxial with the pressure tube and its front face rests flat against the central part of the membrane, an annular air gap is arranged between the outer surface of the sound tube and the inner surface of the pressure tube, said gap being closed at the end opposite to the membrane and there is a sound hole in the wall of the pressure tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sport horn provided with
a pressure tube, a membrane and a sound tube, wherein both
the pressure tube and the sound tube are in connection with
said membrane.The horns of the art produce a sound by the membrane, which
is vibrated by a pressure fluid, generally air. Such horns
are generally used as ship horns or sirens in factories etc.
Accordingdly, they are generally of considerable dimensions
and weight, thus a relativly high pressure is needed for
producing a very strong sound.The HU-PS 89 973, 95 819, 98 353, 100 289 and 101 300 all
disclose such horns. The membrans of these horns are of
metal sheets and are prestressed. The pipe introducing the
pressure fluid is always arranged at the central part of the
membrane, meanwhile a sound tube or horn is coaxial with the
pressure tube and the end thereof bearing the membrane is
arranged around the pressure tube.On the other hand, people on sport events, (for instance
football match) or festivals often use horns made of paper.
These horns produce, however, a rather poor sound.Object of the present invention is therefor to provide a
horn, which is small, light and of simple structure, but is
able to produce a considerable sound, when blown by the
mouth.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a horn
provided with a pressure tube, a membrane and a sound tube, 
wherein both the pressure tube and the sound tube are in
connection with said membrane. According to the invention
the membrane is streched out on the front face of the
pressure tube, the sound tube is arranged within and coaxial
with the pressure tube and its front face rests flat against
the central part of the membrane. An annular air gap is
arranged between the outer surface of the sound tube and the
inner surface of the pressure tube, said gap being closed at
the end opposite to the membrane and there is a sound hole
in the wall of the pressure tube.Both the pressure tube and the sound tube are straight tubes
being arranged coaxially. The end part of the pressure tube
may have a diameter at the membrane, which is greater than
that of the other end part.The thickness of the membrane is preferably between 0,01 and
2 mm and is a plastic foil.The sound tube may be provided with one or more extension
tubes. The width of the air gap is preferably at least 0,2
mm, meanwhile the diameter of the sound hole is preferably
between 0,2 and 50 mm.The invention is based on the recognition that a very strong
sound may be produced, when a rather thin and elastic
membrane is
