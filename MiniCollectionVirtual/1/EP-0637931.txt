<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system and method for
measuring hearing, and more particularly to a system
and method for measuring hearing that may be
successfully applied to individuals unable to respond
to instructions or requests of a person administering
the test. The system and method of testing herein
described may therefore be applied to the measurement
of hearing function in babies, for example, permitting
assessment of their hearing at an earlier age than
possible when methods or systems are used which depend
on communication between tester and subject.It has been known for hundreds of years that the
simultaneous introduction to the ear of two single-frequency
sinusoidal tones, known as primary tones, or
simply as primaries, which are close both in frequency
and in sound pressure level, results in the production
of numerous audible intermodulation distortion
products. The audible distortion products are caused
by nonlinear processes within the ear which are, at
the present time, of unknown origin. Typically, the
frequencies of the primaries used are in the
approximate ratio 1:1.2. It is usual to designate the
lower in frequency of the two primaries as f1 and the
higher as f2. Of the intermodulation distortion
generated by the ear, one in particular, with
frequency 2f1 - f2, is normally perceptible to the
subject to whom the tones are presented. In 1979, Dr. David Kemp established that
distortion tones produced by the cochlea (in the inner
ear) could be detected and measured in the ears of
normal-hearing persons by placing a sensitive
microphone in the ear canal during presentation of the
primaries. Subsequently, Kemp and his colleagues as
well as numerous other researchers in various
countries have obtained data demonstrating that the
absence of measurable distortion tones is associated
with hearing impairment in that region of the audible
spectrum occupied by the two primary tones and the
distortion tone. Such a test is often referred to in
the literature as one employing the evoked distortion
product (EDP) method.Prior to his discovery of the physical and
measurable character of auditory distortion, Kemp, in
1978, established the detectability of a nonlinear
version of an impulsive signal returned, as he
characterized it, in the form of a "reflection" from
the inner ear, which appeared following a brief time
interval after the application to the ear of an
acoustic impulse. By applying a series of acoustic
impulses to the ear and employing a method of
averaging and other signal processing by
