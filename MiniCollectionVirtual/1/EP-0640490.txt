<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording head and a recording apparatus using the
same, in which the recording is effected by ejecting
ink. Here, "recording" means formation, on a
recording material, of any image such as a character
or characters having particular meaning or of any
pattern or the like having or not having any
particular meaning; and "recording material" means not
only paper, but also OHP sheet, color filter
substrate, electric circuit substrate, textile, string
or the like.In an ink jet recording method, droplets of
recording material called "ink" are ejected through
one of various methods onto a recording material such
as a sheet of the paper. As for a method for ejecting
the ink, there are various methods, and among them, a
type in which heat is applied to liquid to produce the
force for ejecting the ink, is particularly noted.More particularly, the liquid is subjected to
change of state by the application of the heat, and
the volume of the liquid is abruptly increased. By
the force produced thereby, the liquid is ejected
through an ejection outlet at an end of a recording 
head. The ejected liquid is deposited on the
recording material.The ink jet recording system is very
effectively used in a so-called "drop-on demand
recording method". In addition, a high density multi-nozzle
recording head can be easily manufactured, and
therefore, a high resolution and high quality images
can be printed at high speed.The recording head used in this method is
provided with ejection outlets for ejecting the
liquid, a liquid ejection portion having an ink
passage with a heat application portion where the
thermal energy for ejecting the droplet of the liquid
is applied to the liquid, and energy generating
elements for producing thermal energy.The energy generating element comprises a
pair of electrodes, and a heat generating resistor
connected between them and effective to produce
thermal energy.A plurality of heat generating resistors are
provided on a heater board (element substrate) 1 of
Si. The heater board 1 comprises built-in heat
generating resistors 2 at least. However, driving
element for the heat generating resistors, temperature
detecting element or subordinate heater, may be
simultaneously built-in, as the case may be.Referring to Figure 1, which is a top plan 
view of the heater board 1 having the energy
generating elements or the like, the heater board 1 also
comprises a temperature sensor 6 for detecting a
temperature of the recording head (ink), a subordinate
heater 107
