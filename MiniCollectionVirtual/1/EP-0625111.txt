<ABSTRACT>
A spacecraft power bus regulation method and apparatus for a spacecraft. The spacecraft has solar arrays (10) and a battery (30) coupled to the spacecraft power bus (32) to drive electrical loads (34). A bus voltage limiter (38) controls the flow of current from the solar arrays while a bidirectional battery controller (36) controls power flow into and out of the battery. A processor (46) monitors current flow and battery condition using sensors (40, 42, 44, 48) and controls the bus voltage limiter accordingly. Auxiliary control is provided by the solar array drive (24) which controls the orientation of the solar arrays with respect to the sun.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the field of spacecraft power bus 
regulation, and in particular, to regulating the power on a spacecraft power bus 
using solar panel positioning. Many spacecraft and, in particular, geosynchronous communications 
satellites, use panels of solar cells to power the electrical equipment loads of the 
spacecraft. Such equipment typically include communications transponders, 
sensors, detectors and data processing equipment. Spacecraft typically include 
a battery for powering the loads when the spacecraft is out of view of the sun. 
Because of variations in the power consumption needs of the spacecraft, 
variations in the amount of power generated by the solar panels and variations 
in the battery condition, many spacecraft regulate the voltage and current on the 
spacecraft power bus which powers the electrical loads. In one design, a battery is coupled to the spacecraft power bus through a 
battery charge controller and a battery discharge controller. The battery 
discharge controller feeds the spacecraft bus from the battery when the load is 
in excess of the solar panel capability. The charge controller feeds current to 
the battery when there is excess bus power available and the battery requires it. 
In other words, when there is a shortage of current on the bus, the battery is 
discharged and when there is a surplus of current on the bus, the battery is 
allowed to be recharged. Solar panels are coupled to the same bus through 
bus voltage limiters. The bus voltage limiters monitor the voltage of the bus and 
either open or close solar panel circuit connections to the bus, regulating the  
 
power supplied by the solar panels, to maintain the voltage and current on the 
bus in as stable a state as possible. The solar panels in such a spacecraft are 
designed with excess power generation capacity so that the battery charge 
condition can be maintained even when the other loads on the bus are heavy. In an alternative design, it is also known to use a bidirectional battery 
controller to regulate the charge state of the battery. However, such a 
bidirectional battery controller puts additional demands on the bus voltage limiter 
to increase or reduce the power supply to the bus in response to the needs of 
the battery. The bus voltage limiter in both designs typically has a large number 
of circuits to control each and every circuit of the solar panel and it is a fairly 
heavy and complex device which adds significantly to the weight of the 
spacecraft. Weight
