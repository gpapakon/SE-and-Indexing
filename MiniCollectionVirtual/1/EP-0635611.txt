<ABSTRACT>
Device for locking the bolts actuated by the strike 
lock in a two-wing emergency door including a casing (1) 

adapted to be arranged in a seat of the upper edge of the 
wing on which the strike lock is applied; the casing (1) is 

provided with a hole (11) for the passage of the bolt (12), 
and a sensor (14) is slideable in the casing; the sensor 

(14) is loaded by a spring (26) and has an end which is 
meant to cooperate with the lintel (28) of the walled frame 

of the door and has a chamfer (25); in the sensor there is 
a pin (20) which is movable transversely and the opposite 

ends whereof engage slots (21, 22) of the casing (1) which 
are shaped so as to lock the bolt (12) in retracted 

position when the sensor (14) is pushed out of the casing 
(1) by virtue of the action of the spring (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for locking
the bolts actuated by the strike lock in a two-wing
emergency door as set out in the first part of claim 1.In emergency doors of this type, both wings open
outwardly and the wing normally used to enter and exit
(hereinafter termed wing A) is provided with a panic-safe
lock which is designed so that the latch and the bolt can
be moved simultaneously into the release position by
operating the handle. The other wing (hereinafter termed
wing B) acts as a rabbet for wing A and is provided with an
upper and a lower bolts which are vertically slideable and
connected, by means of rods, to a so-called panic-safe
actuation strike lock that can be operated by means of an
appropriate handle. The particularity of emergency doors of
the above type is that the latch and the bolt of the lock
installed on wing A engage seats of the strike lock of wing
B, the mechanism whereof is preset so that if only the lock
of wing A is operated, thus retracting the latch and the
bolt, it is possible to open only wing A, since the strike
lock keeps its bolts in locking position. In the strike
lock of wing B instead there is an element which is
expelled from the strike lock and acts within the mechanism
of the lock of wing A, actuating the retraction of the
latch and of the bolt. Therefore the actuation of the
strike lock alone not only opens wing B but also opens wing
A. In known emergency doors, the bolts of wing B, by means
of a key-operated or lever-operated mechanism, are actuated
from the closed position to the open position in contrast 
with return springs. When the wing is in open condition, if
the thrust by means of the mechanism ceases, the springs
push the bolts outwardly again. In particular, the lower
bolt can descend and make contact with the floor. In order
to prevent this, an appropriate device retains the rods.
This device is installed at the exit point of the upper rod
and is activated by the abutment of a mechanical sensor
against the upper rail of the door. Devices of this type
are disclosed in German patents no. 27 46 049, 29 12 881,
and 35 35 344. It has been observed that these known
devices are often the cause of problems due to their
excessive bulk and to their troublesome installation.
Another device is disclosed in European patent no. 348971.
Said device has a limited bulk, but in order to retain the
bolt there is an annular plate that loses its effectiveness
as it wears.GB-A-383 359 discloses a bolt locking device including
a combination of elements as

<CLAIMS>
Device for locking the bolts actuated by the strike
lock in a two-wing emergency door, comprising a casing (1)

adapted to be arranged in a seat (9) of the upper edge (10)
of the wing on which the strike lock is applied, said

casing (1) being provided with a hole (11) for the passage
of the bolt (12), a sensor (14) being slideable in said

casing, said sensor (14) being loaded by a spring (26),
said sensor (14) comprising a pin (20) which is movable

transversely to said sensor (14) in a hole (19) provided in
said sensor (14) so as to lock the bolt (12) in retracted

position when said sensor (14) is pushed out of said casing
(1) by virtue of the action of said spring (26), the device

being 
characterized in that
 the bolt is a sliding
cylindrical rod (12) and the hole (19) in said sensor (14)

extends into the path of the sliding cylindrical rod such
that the pin (20) is releasably engageable with the surface

of the sliding cylindrical rod, opposite ends of said pin
(20) slidably engaging slots (21, 22) of said casing (1),

and said slots (21, 22) being shaped for moving said pin
(20) in said hole (19) of said sensor, and said sensor (14)

having an end provided with a chamfer (25) for cooperating
with a lintel (28) of a walled frame of the door.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said casing (1) comprises a cup (2) with a bottom (5) in

which there is an eccentric hole (11) for the passage of
said bolt (12) and a fixing flange (6) on the opposite side

with respect to said bottom (5), said cup (2) having two
oppositely arranged flat regions (3, 4) in which said slots 

(21, 22) are formed.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that
said sensor (14) has a U-shaped cross-section with a

portion which is guided between said bolt (12) and said cup
(2) and with two wings (15, 16) that wrap around said bolt

(12) and form a channel (17) for said bolt, said hole (19)
being ovalized so as to intersect said channel (17) to act

on said bolt (12) when said sensor (14) is in the positicn
in which it is pushed out of said cup (2) by virtue of the

action of said spring (26).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
said slots (21, 22) which are engaged by the opposite ends

of said pin (20) have a portion (23) which is parallel to
the sliding direction of the sensor (14) and a portion (24)

which is inclined so that during the stroke for pushing out
the sensor (14) by virtue of the action of said spring

(26), said pin (20) moves along said ovalized hole (19) to
lock on said bolt (12).
Device according to any one or more of claims 2 to
4, characterized in that said passage hole (11) is arranged

eccentrically in said cup (2), so that the bolt (12) is in
tangential contact with the inner wall of the cup (2).
Device according to any one or more of claims 2 to
5, characterized in that the spring (26) which acts on said

sensor (14) is partially accommodated in a recess (27) of
said sensor and rests on the bottom (5) of the cup (2).
Device according to any one or more of claims 1 to
6, characterized in that it comprises a spring (33) which

acts between a shoulder (32) of the bolt (12) and a ring
(31) that surrounds said bolt and is fixed to said cup (2) 

by means of a bracket (30), said spring (33) being adapted
to push out the bolt when said sensor (14) abuts in a door

frame lintel (28).
