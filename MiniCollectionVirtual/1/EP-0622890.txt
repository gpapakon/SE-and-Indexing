<ABSTRACT>
A power supply system to be built into a television receiver, for 
powering both the main electric circuitry of the TV set and a remote 

control receiver circuit. The power supply system comprises a transformer 
having a primary winding coupled to a direct current power supply via a 

switching transistor, and secondary windings coupled to the main TV circuitry 
and to the remote control receiver circuit via rectifying and 

smoothing circuits. Duration modulated pulses for on-of control of the 
switching transistor are reduced in recurrence rate when the main TV 

circuitry is not being powered, so that the remote control receiver circuit 
is powered with less switching loss than if the switching frequency is 

left the same as when the main TV circuitry is being powered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power supply systems, and more specifically
to those of the switching type for powering both a primary and a
secondary load, the secondary load being significantly less in power requirement
than the first. The switching power supply system according
to the invention is particularly well suited for use in or with remotely
controllable television receivers, among other applications.A greater majority of television sets today are remotely controllable.
Such TV sets have an inbuilt remote control receiver circuit for
receiving signals from the remote control unit. The remote control receiver
circuit must be powered even when the main electric circuitry of
the TV set is not. The power supply systems of remotely controllable
TV sets are therefore required to possess a circuit for powering the
main circuitry (primary load) and another for powering the remote control
receiver circuit (secondary load). The provision of two totally independent
power supply circuits would be undesirable, however, because the
resulting system would be too bulky and costly.A solution to this problem is found for example in Japanese Unexamined
Patent publication No. 4-308465, in which the two power supply
circuits are combined so as to share some components. More specifically,
this prior art power supply system comprises a switching transistor for
on-off control of a unidirectional supply voltage, and a transformer having
a primary winding connected in series with the switching element, a secondary
winding for powering the main TV set circuitry, and a tertiary
winding for powering the remote control receiver circuit. The switching
transistor is controlled so as to make constant the supply voltage applied
to the main TV set circuitry.Customarily, the switching frequency of such TV set power supply
systems has been as high as from 40 to 100 kilohertz, with a view to
the reduction of the size of the transformer and the suppression of noise 
in the audio frequency range. However, the constant switching of the
direct current power supply at such high frequencies inevitably involves
considerable power losses. The trouble with the prior art switching power
supply system is that such high switching frequencies have been maintained
not only when the main TV set circuitry is being powered but
also when it is not, that is, when only the remote control receiver circuit
is. Naturally, TV sets are held switched on for a much shorter period
of time than off.DE-A-32 23 756 discloses a switch mode power supply for a
