<ABSTRACT>
In a method for bleaching lignocellulose-containing pulp 
with a peroxide-containing compound, the pulp is, prior to the 

bleaching and in optional order, subjected to acid treatment 
at a pH of up to about 5 and treated with a complexing agent 

in order to release transition metal ions from their positions 
in the pulp. After the acid treatment, a magnesium compound 

and a calcium compound are added to the pulp at a pH of from 
about 3.5 to about 8 in order to reintroduce an optimum amount 

of magnesium and calcium ions into the pulp. The pulp is then 
bleached with a peroxide-containing compound at a pH of from 

about 7 to about 13.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for bleaching lignocellulose-containing pulp with a peroxide-containing
compound, in which the pulp, prior to the bleaching is subjected to acid treatment at a pH of up to about 5 and
thereafter treated with a complexing agent in order to release transition metal ions from their positions in the pulp. After
the acid treatment, a magnesium compound and a calcium compound are added to the pulp at a pH of from about 3.5
to about 8 in order to reintroduce an optimum amount of magnesium and calcium ions into the pulp. The pulp is thereafter
bleached with a peroxide-containing compound at a pH of from about 7 to about 13.In the making of lignocellulose-containing pulp of high brightness, the pulp is bleached in one or more stages.
For quite some time, mechanical pulp has been bleached with peroxide-containing compounds in alkaline environment,
the intention being to remove chromophoric groups but preserve the lignin content. For environmental reasons, it has
become increasingly common to treat also chemical pulp as early as in the first bleaching stages with peroxide-containing
compounds in alkaline environment, thereby to remove chromophoric groups as well as lignin. Unless the pulp
is pretreated, however, such bleaching is less effective than bleaching with chlorine-containing bleaching agents. Thus,
hydrogen peroxide bleaching in alkaline environment is disturbed by the presence in the pulp of ions of certain transition
metals, primarily Mn, Cu and Fe. These metal ions cause the hydrogen peroxide to disintegrate into undesirable products,
thereby reducing the effectiveness of the peroxide bleaching and increasing the consumption of peroxide.The prior art teaches the bleaching of chemical as well as mechanical pulp with peroxide-containing compounds
in alkaline environment and in the presence of magnesium salts. Most of the known bleaching processes do
not comprise any acid pretreatment, which preserves the content of desirable as well as undesirable ions in the pulp.Furthermore, EP-A-0 402 335 discloses the pretreatment of chemical pulp with a complexing agent in order
to render more effective subsequent alkaline peroxide bleaching. In this process, it is important that the treatment with
a complexing agent takes place at an almost neutral pH. Moreover, this process is not suitable for treating pulp containing
large amounts of transition metal ions.EP-A-0 511 695 discloses acid treatment of a chemical pulp, thereafter adding magnesium and subsequently
treating the
