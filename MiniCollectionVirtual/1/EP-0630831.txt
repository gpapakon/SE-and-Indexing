<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collection vehicle comprising a body 
defining a chamber for receiving the material collected and a hoist, which is 
capable of operation to raise from the ground a bin and to tip the bin in or over 
an opening of the vehicle body to discharge contents of the bin into the body. The hoist is commonly provided at the rear of a collection vehicle. When 
a vehicle having a hoist at the rear of the vehicle body is used for the collection 
of refuse from individual dwellings, it is necessary for the bins to be brought from 
the dwellings to the rear of the vehicle. Whilst the occupant of each dwelling can 
be expected to move the bin from the dwelling to the edge of his property 
adjacent to the street, it is necessary for operators of the vehicle to move the bins 
from that position into the roadway and up to the hoists on the vehicle. It is also 
necessary for the operators to return the bins from the roadway to or adjacent to 
the property which comprises the dwelling, in order that the bins will not obstruct 
the roadway. Similar considerations can also apply in connection with trade 
waste. According to the present invention, there is provided a collection vehicle 
comprising a body defining a chamber for receiving the material collected and an 
opening adjacent to a top of the body and communicating with the chamber, 
running wheels, an engine for driving at least some of the running wheels, a cab 
for accommodating a driver and a hoist mounted on the body at one side of the 
body, wherein the hoist is capable of operation to raise from the ground beside 
the vehicle a bin and to tip the bin in or over the opening to discharge contents 
of the bin into the vehicle body, the hoist comprising a bin carrier, holding means 
for holding the bin on the carrier, a support for the bin carrier, a connecting 
means connecting the bin carrier with the support for tipping of the carrier 
relative to the support, tipping means for tipping the bin carrier relative to the 
support, a guide means for guiding the support for upwards and downwards  
 
movement relative to the body, and lifting means for raising the support and 
lowering the support along the guide means. An example of a vehicle embodying the invention will now be described, 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
FIGURE 1 is a fragmentary side elevation showing the hoist and adjacent 
parts of a vehicle embodying the invention; FIGURE 2 is a plan view of certain parts represented in Figure 1; FIGURE 3

<CLAIMS>
A collection vehicle comprising a body defining a chamber for receiving 
the material collected and an opening adjacent to a top of the body and 

communicating with the chamber, running wheels, an engine for driving at least 
some of the running wheels, a cab for accommodating a driver and at least one 

hoist mounted on the body at one side of the body, wherein the or each hoist is 
capable of operation to raise from the ground beside the vehicle a bin and to tip 

the bin in or over the opening to discharge contents of the bin into the vehicle 
body, the hoist comprising a bin carrier, holding means for holding the bin on the 

carrier, a support for the bin carrier, a connecting means connecting the bin 
carrier with the support for tipping of the carrier relative to the support, tipping 

means for tipping the bin carrier relative to the support, a guide means for 
guiding the support for upwards and downwards movement relative to the body, 

and lifting means for raising the support and lowering the support along the guide 
means. 
A vehicle according to claim 1 wherein a pair of hoists are mounted on the 
body at said one side of the body and each hoist is capable of operation 

independently of the other hoist to raise from the ground beside the vehicle a bin 
and to tip each bin in or over the opening to discharge contents of the bin into 

the vehicle body. 
A vehicle according to claim 2 wherein each guide means is cylindrical. 
A vehicle according to claim 2 or claim 3 wherein each guide means guides 
each support along a rectilinear path and a rectilinear track is provided which is 

parallel to each guide means. 
A vehicle according to claim 4 wherein each support embraces a guide 
means and is a sliding fit therewith, the support having a runner which runs along 

a track and restrains the support against turning about the axis of the guide 
means. 
A vehicle according to claim 4 or claim 5 wherein one of the guide means 
is displaced forwards from the other guide means, the respective supports of the 

hoists lie mainly between the guide means and the respective tracks lie 
substantially between the supports of the two hoists. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 4 to 6 wherein each support is 
mounted in cantilever on the guide means. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 2 to 7 wherein interlocking means 
are provided mechanically to interlock the hoists. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 2 to 8 wherein the guide means 
have respective upper end portions which lie above the level of the upper ends 

of the tracks. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the lifting 
means of the or each hoist comprises an hydraulic piston and cylinder unit and 

a lever for transmitting motion from the piston and cylinder unit to the support 
with amplification of the movement. 
A vehicle according to Claim 10 wherein the piston and cylinder unit of the 
lifting means lies above the chamber define
d by the body. 
A vehicle according to Claim 10 or Claim 11 wherein the lever is mounted 
on the body for pivoting relative thereto about a pivot axis which extends along 

the vehicle and which is nearer to a side of the vehicle body remote from the or 
 

each hoist than to the side of the vehicle body at which the or each hoist is 
mounted. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 10 to 12 wherein the lever is 
connected to the support by a link means pivotally connected to the lever and to 

the support. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 10 to 13 wherein there are two 
hoists each of which is provided with a said lifting means. 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 10 to 13 wherein there is a hoist 
provided with two of said lifting means one at each of two opposite sides thereof. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the guide 
means have respective upper end portions which lie above the level of the 

opening. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the tipping 
means of the carrier comprises a guide surface and a guided member movable 

along a track as the support is raised. 
A vehicle according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the holding 
means comprises first and second holding members adapted to engage a portion 

of a bin, relative movement of the holding members into engagement with the bin 
being caused by a linkage provided between the carrier and the support effective 

to cause said clamping movement when the carrier is pivoted relative to the 
support. 
A vehicle according to claim 18 wherein the linkage comprises a link 
pivotally connected to the carrier and pivotally connected to the support about an 

axis offset from the axis of pivotal connection of the carrier to the support. 
A vehicle according to claim 10 or any one of claims 11 to 19 when directly 
or indirectly dependent on claim 10, which further comprises a lid opening means 

operable to open the lid as a result of operation of the hoist and the lid opening 
means is moved by a drive derived from said lever for transmitting motion from 

the piston and cylinder unit to the support and wherein said lever is provided with 
a lost motion device whereby initial movement of said lever for initial lifting of 

a bin does not cause movement of the lid opening means and further movement 
of said lever causes movement of the lid opening means to open the lid.
