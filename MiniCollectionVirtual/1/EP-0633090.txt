<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of arc welding, 
characterised by holding the arc current at a reduced 

level at the start of the welding operation thereby to 
avoid substantial welding of the work until at least a 

major proportion of the particles displaced by the plasma 
flow at the generation of the arc have dissipated, and 

thereafter increasing said arc current to the regular 
level for welding; thereby to reduce contamination of the 

work by the particles. The work may be a joint between 
two pipes; a back shielding gas may be applied in the 

pipes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding process,
particularly for super high purity gas feeding system
piping common in semiconductor manufacturing plants and
the like.In plants in which super high purity gas is used, such
for example as semiconductor manufacturing plants, the
gas feeding system piping is typically constructed from
stainless steel (SUS 316L) electro polished pipes. Non-welded
union joints are commonly used to connect
individual pipes to each other.However, nonwelded joints have inherent problems in that
they are susceptible of gas leakages, thereby reducing
the amount of system gas available for re-use, and they
lead to increased piping costs, when compared with other
joining methods. As a consequence, connection by welding
has been adopted, and special processes have been
developed such for example as automatic TIG butt-welding
or automatic processes using special joints e.g. welding
collars.Achieving sufficient weld strength is important in these
processes, especially when welding stainless steel or
other weld sensitive materials, but in addition to this,
there are following important requirements: 
(a) the weld should not cause contamination to
pipelines, by acting as a source of contaminant
particles, and (b) the surface of the weld should be smooth and flat
with the minimum irregularities thereby promoting the
formation of a corrosion resistant passive film.As a step towards meeting the above requirements, the
present inventor developed a technique to reduce the
effects of particles at the welds by feeding a back
shielding gas, such for example as argon, through pipes
during welding and optimizing the internal pipe pressure
of the gas so that ingress of particles into the pipe
during welding is reduced; this technique is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application No. 3-216158.The above-mentioned technique is characterised by feeding
back shielding gas inward from one end of the stainless
steel piping, and adjusting the flow rate of said back
shielding gas such that the internal pressure of both
stainless steel pipes to be welded is increased to a
specified pressure, then arc welding the engaging grooves
of the pipes in the presence of an arc gas. When welding
by a conventional process in which no back shielding gas
is used, several thousand particles typically enter the
pipe during welding; the aforementioned technique however
may produce excellent results in that the number of 
particles entering the pipe of greater than 0.1Âµm may be
reduced to less than scores of particles.But,
