<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of organosilicon
polymers and prepolymers from cyclic polysiloxanes.
The invention also relates to the preparation of cyclic
polysiloxanes.Leibfried, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,900,779, 4,902,731 and
5,013,809, and Bard and Burnier in U.S. Patent Nos.
5,008,360 and 5,068,303, describe crosslinked organosilicon
polymers and crosslinkable organosilicon prepolymers
comprising alternating polycyclic hydrocarbon residues and
cyclic polysiloxane or siloxysilane residues linked through
carbon-to-silicon bonds. These polymers are useful, for
example, in structural and electronic applications.Although cyclic trisiloxanes were disclosed for use in
the preparation of organosilicon polymers and prepolymers in
U.S. Patent 5,013,809 (Leibfried) and in Research Disclosure
326103 (June, 1991), these cyclic trisiloxanes were required
to have two or more hydrogen atoms bound to silicon. Only
cyclosiloxanes containing four or more silicon atoms were 
used in the preparation of these polymers and prepolymers,
because cyclotrisiloxanes are not readily available and are
unstable. It is also known that cyclotrisiloxanes with
hydrogen atoms and methyl groups bonded to every silicon
atom are not storage-stable.In Chemical Abstracts Vol. 77, 1972, abstract No. 88573n 1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-tridicyclopentadienylcyclotrisiloxane
and a
process for the preparation of this compound is disclosed.According to this invention organosilicon crosslinked
polymers or crosslinkable prepolymers are prepared by a
hydrosilation reaction and are characterized in that they
are the reaction product of:
(a) a cyclic polysiloxane having the formula:

where R is a saturated, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl
or alkoxy group or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or
aryloxy group, R' is a substituted or unsubstituted
hydrocarbon group having at least one nonaromatic carbon-carbon
double bond that is reactive in hydrosilation, and n
is 3, or a mixture of 3 and 4, and(b) at least one organosilicon compound having at least
two ≡SiH groups selected from the group consisting of (1)
cyclic polysiloxanes and (2) tetrahedral siloxysilanes.The reaction mixture can optionally contain as a third
component (c) at least one hydrocarbon polyene having at 
least two nonaromatic carbon-carbon double bonds that are
reactive in hydrosilation.Also according to the invention, a method is disclosed
for preparing the fully-substituted cyclic polysiloxanes,
and processes are disclosed for preparing prepolymers and
polymers from the
