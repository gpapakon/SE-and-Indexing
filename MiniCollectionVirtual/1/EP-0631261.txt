<ABSTRACT>
In conjunction with a device (100) for the vertical stacking of coins (1) or suchlike disc-shaped articles supplied individually in succession, with at least one coin carrier (102) receiving the coin stack, the coin carrier (102) being formed by a U-shaped finger (103) connected fixedly to a transport means (122) which guides the coin carriers (102) along a guide track (104) in such a way that the transport means (122) together with the coin carriers (102) move downwards in the stacking space (106), it is proposed to arrange the plane of the guide track (F) laterally offset in relation to the stacking plane (S). The coin carriers (102) are aligned laterally in the direction of the axes of the driving wheels of the transport means (122) and project beyond the width of the latter. The coin carriers (102), the transport means (122) and the supporting structure of these elements are fastened immovably and independently of the size of the coins (1) to be stacked and have no mechanical connection with the stacking space (106); the coin carriers (102) project laterally into the stacking space (106) in such a way that the centre of the stacking space (106) is located on the centre line of the coin feed; the stacking space (106) is limited by movable side parts (107, 108) which can be matched in their shape according to the cross-section of the articles to be stacked.

A device for vertically stacking coins, fed in one by one from a 
coin feed (200), or similar disc-shaped objects, comprising at least 

one coin carrier (102) receiving the stack of coins and movable 
downwards in a stacking chamber (106) - adaptable to the coins 

(1) to be stacked - in synchrony with the growth of the stack, 
wherein the coin carrier (102) is formed by a U-shaped finger (103) 

projecting horizontally into the stacking chamber (106) and fixed to 
a continuously rotating transportation means (122) rotating along a 

specified, preferably substantially rectangular guide path (F) and 
conveying the coin carrier in such a manner that the 

transportation means (122) moves downwards with the coin carrier 
(102) in the stacking chamber (106) in a positionally stable manner 

as the coins (1) are stacked, characterised 

a) in that the coin carrier (102) and the transportation means (122) 
conveying the latter are combined to form an independent 

stacking arrangement (100), 
b) in that the stacking arrangement (100) is co-ordinated with the 
coin feed (200) in such a manner that the plane (F) of the 

guide path of the transportation means is located outside the 
stacking plane (S) formed by the coin feed (200), the 

circulating path of the coin carrier (102) and the axis of the 
stacking chamber (106) and is laterally displaced relative to 

the said stacking plane (S), and in that the coin carrier (102) 
projects laterally into the stacking chamber (106) so that the  

 
centre of the stacking chamber (106) lies on the axis of the coin 

feed (200) and is also the centre of the U-shaped finger (103) 
forming the coin carrier (102), and 
c) in that the stacking chamber (106) is delimited by up to four 
movable side parts (107, 108), the shape of which is preferably 

adaptable to the cross-section of the objects to be stacked. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the U-shaped 
finger (103), forming the coin support, is adapted to the contact 

surface and contact shape of the smallest coin (1) or the smallest 
disc-shaped object. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the coin 
carrier (102) is driven by means of a single continuous 

transportation means (122), for example a toothed belt or a 
conveyor chain. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that at least two side parts (107) of the stacking chamber (106) are 

sufficiently adapted to the shape of the objects to be stacked to 
ensure that the stack is conveyed downwards in an optimum 

manner without tilting or shifting sideways, and in that the stacking 
chamber is delimited by a stop rail or side part (108) arranged 

opposite the feed direction. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, having a receiving 
pin (301) provided for the stack of coins at the transition to a 

subsequently arranged rolling station (300), characterised in that 
the U-shaped finger (103) and the receiving height of the receiving 

pin (301) are dimensioned and adjusted to one another so that the  
 

receiving height coincides exactly with the shift of the U-shaped 
finger (103) from the horizontal stacking direction into the 

deflection of the guide path. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that the receiving 
pin (301) is designed so that the U-shaped finger (103) can pass by 

on both sides. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, having a contact 
member acting on the upper side of the uppermost coin (1) of the 

stack of coins, characterised in that the contact member is 
coupled to a secondary contact sensor registering differences in 

the thickness of the coins (1). 
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that the contact 
member is a swivel-mounted ball bearing (112) dimensioned and 

extending into the guide path in such a manner that the U-shaped 
finger (103) brushes past. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that a plurality of coin carriers (102) are provided on the 

continuous transportation means (122), the smallest distance 
between them conforming to the greatest stacking height of the 

coins (1) to be processed.
