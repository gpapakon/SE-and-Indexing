<ABSTRACT>
The container (1) comprises a generally rigid support (6) 
which, in combination with a filter element such as a 

net (9), defines a blood-inlet chamber of 
substantially constant size and geometrical shape. An 

expandible holding portion (7) is associated with the 
support (6) and, preferably, has a bellows-like 

configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to containers for blood
comprising a container envelope which is at least partially expandible in oder to hold the blood introduced into the envelope, and filter means defining a blood-inlet chamber within the envelope.Containers of this type are currently used, for
example, for transfusion purposes and in surgery for
receiving and holding quantities of blood taken from
the patient's body, for example, when the body is
connected in an extracorporeal circulation system.In general, two kinds of container of this type are
known in the art, that is:
those constituted by actual bags, that is, envelopes
of sheet material suitable for use in contact with
blood (for example, PVC or polyurethane), forming
generally flexible envelopes which can swell up to a
greater or lesser extent according to the quantity of
blood within them, andhybrid solutions such as that described, for example,
in United States Patent US-A-4 424 190 in which the
container comprises a concave, rigid, cylindrical shell
and a flexible membrane; at rest, the membrane is
disposed close to the internal wall of the shell and,
when the blood flows into the container, the membrane
bulges to a greater or lesser extent and, in the
condition in which it is filled to the maximum
permitted by the container, reaches a shape
approximately complementary and symmetrical to that of
the rigid shell.Whichever solution is used, the container usually has
at least one connection for the inlet of blood (taken 
from the patient's body), a vent pipe for any air
trapped in the blood, and at least one outlet pipe.
Particularly in applications in an operating
environment (extracorporeal circulation systems with
blood oxygenators) there is usually also a further
connection for the return of blood from the cardiotome,
as well as a connection for recirculation from the
oxygenator.In this latter situation of use in particular, it is
imperative to ensure that any air entrained by the
blood flowing into the container is eliminated as
completely as possible. In fact, any air trapped in
the blood may fragment, even at a microscopic level,
and this may result in more or less extensive damage to
the patient to whom the blood is reinfused. For this
reason, it is current practice for a container of the
type specified above to have, downstream of the
blood-inlet connector, a filtering net (constituted,
for example, by a sheet of polyester or polyamide with
holes having diameters of the order of 40-200 microns)
through which the blood entering the

<CLAIMS>
A container for blood comprising:

a container envelope (6, 7) which is at least

partially expandible (7) in order to hold the blood
introduced (2) into the envelope (6, 7),
filter means (9) defining a blood-inlet chamber
within the envelope (6, 7), and
a generally rigid
support (6) which supports the filter means (9) so as

to define a blood-inlet chamber the geometrical shape
of which is generally constant regardless of the

expansion condition of the container envelope (6, 7), said
support (6) comprising a portion having a

generally tank-shaped configuration (8) with a
respective mouth portion, the filter means (9) being

generally flat and extending over the mouth portion of
the tank-shaped portion (8),

said container being

characterized in that
 the filter means (9) are separate
from the periphery of the support (6) locally in at least one region of

the filter means (9) which is intended to face upwards
in use.
A container according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the container envelope (6, 7) is
defined by an expandible portion (7), in combination

with the generally rigid support (6).
A container according to Claim 2,

characterized in that
 both the filter means (9) and the
expandible portion (7) are anchored to the support (6)

on the mouth portion of the tank-like portion (8). 
A container according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the expandible portion (7) has a generally
bellows-like configuration.
A container according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the support (6) is
generally flat.
A container according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the generally rigid support (6) has an area
substantially corresponding to the area of the

expandable portion (7) so that, in use, the support (6)
supports the expandible portion (7) which expands when

it receives the blood within it.
A container according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it comprises at least one
connector (2, 5, 5a) for admitting the blood to the

container, and 
in that
 the at least one connector (2,
5, 5a) is located on the support (6).
A container according to Claim 1 and Claim 7,

characterized in that
 the tank-shaped portion (8) has
at least one of a connector (5) for the connection of

the return from a cardiotome and a connector (5a) for
recirculation from a oxygenator.
A container according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it comprises at least one 
connector (3) for the outlet of the blood from the

container and at least one connector (4a, 4b) for
venting aeriforms which may be in the blood from the

container, and 
in that
 the at least one outlet
connector (3) and the at least one vent connector (4a,

4b) are located in end positions of the container (1).
A container according to Claim 2 and Claim 9,

characterized in that
 the at least one outlet connector
(3) and the at least one vent connector (4a, 4b) are

disposed in the expandible portion (7).
A container according to Claim 10, 
characterized in
that
 the expandible portion (7) comprises pointed
portions which are directed towards the at least one

outlet connector (3) and towards the at least one vent
connector (4a, 4b).
A container according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the support (6) is made
of a material selected from the group constituted by

PVC and polymethyl methacrylate.
A container according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the expandible portion (7) is made of a material
selected from the group constituted by PVC and

polyurethane.
