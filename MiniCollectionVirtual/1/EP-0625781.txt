<ABSTRACT>
An editing apparatus makes an output video signal 
by effecting an editing processing on a plurality of video 

signals. An output video signal is generated by effecting a 
video special effect on first and second input video 

signals. There are generated first and second video clips 
representing a starting position and an ending position set 

to the first input video signal, third and fourth video 
clips representing a starting position and an ending 

position set to a second input video signal, and fifth and 
sixth video clips representing a starting position and an 

ending position set to an output video signal. The first, 
second, third and fourth video clips are displayed on the 

basis of time information attached to each video clip so as 
to express a positional relationship of the first, second, 

third and fourth video clips on a time axis. Also, the fifth 
and sixth video clips are displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an editing
apparatus for use in editing a video signal.U.S. patent No. 5,103,348 describes a prior
editing apparatus.Also, there is proposed an editing apparatus which
will be described below with reference to FIG. 1 of the
accompanying drawings. As shown in FIG. 1, this editing
apparatus is comprised of VTRs (video tape recorders) 2, 3,
an editor 1 for previously fine adjusting and controlling
the VTRs 2, 3 and a VTR 6 for recording video signals from
the VTRs 2, 3 in various manners before editing, a switcher
4 for selecting the video signals supplied thereto from the
VTRs 2, 3, a DME (digital multi-effector) 5 for subjecting
the video signal supplied thereto from the switcher 4 to
various video special effects and supplying the thus
processed video signal back to the switcher 4 and the VTR 6
for recording the video signal from the switcher 4.The fundamental processing of the conventional
editing apparatus thus arranged as shown in FIG. 1 will be
described below. The user can select where to use material
recorded on a video tape cassette set on the VTR 2 and
material recorded on a video tape cassette set on the VTR 3
or how to use the material of the video tape cassette set on
the VTR 2 or the material of the video cassette tape on the
VTR 3 while checking a menu picture displayed on a picture
screen of a monitor 1A of the editor 1. The material of the
VTR 2 will be referred hereinafter to as "roll A", and that
of the VTR 3 will be referred hereinafter to as "roll B",
respectively.Further, the user can designate where to use the
material of the roll A and the material of the roll B by
inputting time codes or by designating time codes supplied
thereto from the VTR 2 or 3 upon playback as an in-point IN 
and an out-point OUT when the user carries out suitable
operation, such as a depression of a switch or the like.
The in-point IN represents the time code of first image of
the material to be used, and the out-point OUT represents a
time code of last image of the material to be used.The switcher 4 processes the video signals
supplied thereto from the VTRs 2 and 3 in some suitable
transition processing fashion, such as wipe, dissolve, etc.
Further, the DME 5 (or switcher 4) effects some suitable
processing, such as a designation of a processing on a time
base, which will be referred to as a time line, or the like
on the video signals supplied thereto, whereafter the video
signal thus processed is recorded on the VTR 6 or previewed
(i.e., video signal thus processed is
