<ABSTRACT>
A static random access memory device is equipped with a reset 
controller capable of performing a reset operation at high speed 

and with a reduced circuit configuration. The device has a 
memory cell including first and second data holding nodes and 

selectively connected to an associated bit line. The memory cell 
is equipped with a control gate for supplying a first voltage in 

common to said first and second holding nodes and, in response 
to a reset mode signal, supplying the first voltage to the first 

holding node and a second voltage being different from the first 
voltage to the second holding node. In this reset operation, a 

word decoder and word driver circuit is deactivated and inhibited 
from selecting and driving any word line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a static type random access 
memory device (SRAM), more particularly to a SRAM having a reset 
controller for resetting stored data at a high speed. A conventional memory cell of a static type memory device has 
a pair of cross coupled transistors, that is, a gate electrode 
of each transistor being connected to a drain electrode of the 
other. The gate electrodes are connected to bit lines via 
transfer gate transistors, respectively. One of the bit lines 
is used for read access operation and the other is for write 
access or reset operation, as described below. A functional block diagram of a static random access memory 
device is shown in Fig. 6 which has a one mega bits capacity with 
a bit construction such as 1 mega words x 1 bit. Memory cells 
30 in a cell array are arranged in 1024 rows and 1024 columns, 
for example. Each of memory cells 30 is placed at a cross 
section of a word line W1, W2 or Wn and a bit line B0, B1 or Bm, 
as shown in Fig. 6, wherein only one of each pair of bit lines 
is shown for simplicity. In read mode operation, address signals A10 - A19 are input 
to a word decoder 42 through an address bus 41. The decoder 42 
decodes the address signals and therefore drives selected one of 
the word lines Wn to be its active level. Each memory cell 30  
 
corresponding to the word line Wn is connected and outputs its 
holding data to a respective pair of bit lines. A column 
selector, which is supplied with address signals A0 - A9 via an 
address bus 41, selects one of the pairs of bit lines and 
connects it to an input and output terminal 43. In write mode operation, the decoder 42 decades the address 
signals A10 -A19 and drives selected one of the word lines Wn. 
Each memory cell 30 corresponding to the word line Wn is 
connected to the respective pair of bit lines. The column 
selector supplied with the address signals A0 - A9 selects and 
drives one of the pairs of bit lines according to an input data 
from the input and output terminal 43. A typical circuit configuration of the memory cell 30 so 
called four transistor type is shown in Fig. 7. Transistors 1 
through 4 are of N channel type with back gate electrodes 
connected to a grounding voltage GND. Drain electrodes of the 
transistors 1 and 2 are connected to a power supply voltage VDD 
via load resistances 5 and 6 respectively. Source electrodes of 
the transistors 1 and 2 are commonly connected to the grounding 
voltage. Gate electrodes of the transistors 1 and 2 are 
connected to the
