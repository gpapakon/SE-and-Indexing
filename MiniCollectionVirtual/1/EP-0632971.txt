<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
facilitating stubbing a cigarette suitable for ashtrays of 
vehicles such as automobiles, airplanes, boats and on desks. As shown in Fig. 8, a conventional ashtray for 
vehicles, especially for automobiles, includes, for example, 
an ashtray 1 with an ash-receiving portion 1a, a recess 10 
for receiving a cigarette and a portion 11 against which a 
cigarette is stubbed out. A conventional desk ashtray has, 
as shown in Fig. 7, a cigarette rest portion 10 and an ash-receiving 
portion 1a. The cigarette rest portion 10 is 
formed on a shoulder portion which stretches out from the 
top end of the ash-receiving portion 1a. These conventional types of ashtrays, however, have 
shortcomings to be exemplified below. When a cigarette is 
being putting out in such ashtrays, ashes are liable to 
scatter around and make a mess around that area. And, 
if a cigarette is not completely put out and is still 
smoldering, it hurts a person's eyes and, what is worse, it 
may cause a fire. Especially when a person is driving an automobile, 
he or she often has to crush out a cigarette in a hurry 
using an ashtray provided in the automobile. Therefore 
ashes usually easily scatter thereabout and the cigarette 
is prone to keep smoldering, not being put out completely.  In order to overcome the foregoing shortcomings 
existing in conventional ashtrays, it is a primary object of 
the present invention to provide a device for facilitating 
putting out a cigarette adaptable to these conventional 
ashtrays. A device for facilitating putting out a cigarette in 
an ashtray of the present invention comprises a cigarette 
inserting cylinder which is provided on the ashtray and 
has a bottom and an ash-fall opening . The cigarette 
is crushed out against the bottom and the ashes fall 
down through the ash-fall opening provided on the bottom. If the bottom of the ashtray is 
horizontal, providing an uplifted portion thereon is 
preferable. The uplifted portion may be positioned below 
and close to the bottom of the cigarette 
inserting cylinder . The device for facilitating stubbing cigarettes in an 
ashtray of the present invention being constituted as stated 
above, inserting a lit cigarette into the cigarette 
inserting cylinder and pressing it down against the 
bottom allows complete extinction of the cigarette. At the 
same time the ashes thereof fall down through the ash-fall 
opening so that they do not scatter around. When the 
ashtray has a horizontal ash-receiving portion and an

<CLAIMS>
A device for attachment to an ashtray (1) to 
facilitate stubbing out a cigarette (T), characterised by a 

cylinder (6) one end of which is open whereby the lit end of 
the cigarette (T) can be inserted therein, the other end of 

the cylinder (6) comprising a bottom (6a) against which the 
lit end of the cigarette (T) is crushed, and one or more ash-fall 

openings (7) in said bottom (6a) through which ash from 
the lit end of the cigarette (T) falls into the ashtray (1). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 in which the cylinder 
(6) comprises a lower portion and an upper portion, the lower 

portion having a diameter slightly greater than that of the 
cigarette (T) to be inserted therein, and the upper portion 

having a diameter substantially twice that of the lower 
portion. 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 and 
further comprising a cigarette rest (3) for location over the 

ashtray (1), the cylinder (6) being supported in the rest (3) 
and the rest (3) having at least one first opening (4) therein 

through which cigarettes (T) can be dumped into the ashtray 
(1), and at least one further opening through which ashes can 

fall into the ashtray (1). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 and 
further comprising an uplifted portion (2) for location in the 

ashtray (1) below the cylinder (6) to guide ash passing 
through the ash-fall opening (7) into the lower regions (1a) 

of the ashtray (1).
