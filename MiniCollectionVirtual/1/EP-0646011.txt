<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rectal pharmaceutical composition for the 
treatment of prostatic hypertrophy. Particularly, the invention relates to rectal 
pharmaceutical compositions containing as the active ingredient Serenoa repens 
extract. Serenoa repens, which is also known as Sabal serrulatum, is a small palm 
growing in United States, North Africa and Spain, the lipid-sterol extract of which, 
obtained according to FR-2480754 or EP-68055 patents, has been used for a long 
time for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (prostatic adenoma), prostatitis 
or other prostatic disorders. The therapeutic scheme used up to now envisages the 
oral administration of 300 - 1000 mg of extract daily. Therapy must generally be 
continued for at least two months before an improvement in symptomatology can be 
attained, and sometimes treatment has to be extended even for 3-4 or more months, in 
order to obtain a complete remission. Now it has been found that Serenoa repens lipid-sterol extracts, administered 
by the rectal route in form of soft-gelatin capsules, gives beneficial 
results in patients suffering from prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis or related 
pathologies, in surprisingly shorter times compared with the conventional oral 
therapy. According to the invention, a marked improvement in symptomatology can be 
evidenced already after one week of treatment, whereas the oral treatment requires 
about two months of treatment to obtain the same results, as proved in clinical trials 
in which the two different administration routes were compared according to a double 
blind evaluation scheme. Therefore, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions suitable for 
the rectal administration, containing Serenoa repens extracts as the active ingredient 
admixed with rectally acceptable carriers, in form of soft-gelatin capsules.  
 The Serenoa repens lipid-sterol extract can be formulated, according to the 
invention, in any form suitable for the enteral or rectal administration, for example 
suppositories, microclysms, soft-gelatin rectal capsules, rectal ointments, sprays and 
the like. For this purpose, conventional excipients or carriers and techniques can be 
used, such as those described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Science Handbook, 
Mack Pub. Co., XVII ed, N.Y., USA." As an example, for the formulation of soft-gelatin 
capsules, an oily dispersion of the active ingredient will be used,obtained 
using diluents such as plyethylene glycols, vaseline oil, all the vegetable and
