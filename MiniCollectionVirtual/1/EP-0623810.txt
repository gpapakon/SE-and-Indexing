<ABSTRACT>
A weighing and filling machine for free-flowing or pourable filling materials is equipped for the purpose of simultaneously metering, in an accurately-weighed manner, self-flowing bulk goods of the first type gravimetrically and non-self-flowing bulk materials of the second type via a metering screw into the individual containers.

Weighing filling machine for flowable and bulk filling
materials, with a frame (1), with at least one weighing

cell (5), which is mounted on the frame to be movable on a
predetermined path and is fitted to receive at least one

container to be filled, with a circular storage container
(11) for filling material as well as with discharge means

(21) for the filling material exiting from the storage
container, said discharge means being allocated to the

weighing cell and constructed for alignment to the filling
opening of its container, with closing elements (22) of the

filling material discharge means as well as with a control
means (8) for controlling the closing elements in

dependence upon a weight signal of the weighing cell for
the purpose of gravimetric metering of the filling

material, characterised in

that inside the circular storage container (11), a first
ring-shaped chamber region (15) is partitioned, which is

fitted to receive a filling material (16) of a first type
and from which exit first filling material discharge means

(21),
that it has an arrangement (23, 25, 26) for feeding at
least one filling material of a second type into a

container of at least one weighing cell,
that the arrangement contains its own transport means
(26) for the filling material of the second type, which may

be actuated by the control means (8) for metering this
filling material, and downstream of which filling material

guide means (23) are arranged which connect to second
filling material discharge means (25),
that the filling material guide means (23) for the
filling material of the second type are arranged adjacent

to the ring-shaped chamber region (15) in the storage
container (11).
Weighing filling machine according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the transport means have at least one

driven worm conveyor (28; 30), the drive of which is
controlled in accordance with the respective amount of

filling material to be fed in.
Weighing filling machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the transport means (26) are arranged

to be fixed and arranged downstream of them are filling
material guide means (23) moved together with the weighing

cell (5) and connecting to the second filling material
discharge means (25).
Weighing filling machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the fixed transport means

(31) are provided above the filling material guide means
(23).
Weighing filling machine according to Claim 4,
characterised in that the filling material guide means have

a number of essentially kidney-shaped shafts (22) in the
manner of filling hoppers on the inlet side, which are

arranged in a second ring region (24) inside the storage
container (11), and each of which is connected to the

second filling material discharge means (25) respectively
allocated to a weighing cell (5).
Weighing filling machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that dust extraction means (34,

35) are allocated to the filling material discharge means

(21; 25).
Weighing filling machine according to Claim 6,
characterised in that the dust extraction means of the 

filling material discharge means (21, 25) of all the
weighing cells (5) are passed centrally through the storage

container (11) at least in sections (at 34).
Weighing filling machine according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it has a station (41) to be

passed through by each weighing cell (5) on its path to
determine the tare of its container (7), and when this is

passed through the respective weighing cell (5) transmits a
tare signal to the control means (8), from which filling

weight signals for the closing elements (22) of the filling
material discharge means (21) and/or for the transport

means (26) may be derived in the control means (8).
Weighing filling machine according to Claims 6 and 8,
characterised in that the dust extraction means (35) of the

individual filling material discharge means (21; 25) are
constructed to be retained in an inactive state during

their passage through the tare station (41).
