<ABSTRACT>
A wiper blade (1) is proposed which is used for cleaning windscreens on motor vehicles. The windscreen wiper blade (1) comprises an elongate main bow (14) which is U-shaped in cross-section and at the ends of which there are coupled further bows (16), of which at least two grasp, with pairs of claws (18) arranged at their ends, the longitudinal sides of an elongate, rubber-elastic wiper strip (20) which rests on the windscreen (32) to be wiped. On that side of the main bow which is at least predominantly affected by the relative wind flowing against it there is arranged a spoiler (30) extending to the windscreen, and in the base wall connecting the two U-limbs of the main bow (14) there are arranged openings (28). Particularly disturbance-free deflection of the relative wind flowing against the wiper blade (1) during its operation is achieved when the openings (28) extend into the U-limb (26), which faces away from the spoiler (30), of the main bow (14).

<CLAIMS>
Wiper blade for windscreens of motor vehicles,
having a carrying framework (12) which has an elongate,

cross-sectionally U-shaped main bracket (14) at the ends
of which there are articulated further brackets (16), and

at least two of these further brackets, by means of claw
pairs (18) arranged at their ends, grip the longitudinal

sides of an elongate, elastomeric wiper strip (20) which
rests on the windscreen which is to be wiped, a spoiler

(30) which extends as far as the windscreen being
arranged on that side of the main bracket (14) which is

at least predominantly exposed to the flow of the
relative wind, and through-passages (28) being arranged

in the base wall (22), which connects the two U-legs (24,
26) of the main bracket, characterized in that the

through-passages (28) extend into the U-leg (26) of the
main bracket (14), said U-leg being directed away from

the spoiler (30).
Wiper blade according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the through-passages (28) have at least one side

edge (42), and these side edges enclose an acute angle α
with the longitudinal axis (44) of the main bracket (14).
Wiper blade according to Claim 2, characterized
in that, when the wiper blade (10) has covered half of

its swing angle on the windscreen (32), said angle being
essentially between 90° and 100°, the side edge (42) runs

approximately horizontally.
