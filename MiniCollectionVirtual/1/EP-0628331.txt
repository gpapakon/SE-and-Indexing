<ABSTRACT>
Spray drying system for drying a liquid feed, consisting of a solution or 
suspension of particles in a fluid medium.

 
The system enables spray drying of wet material and converting thereof 

into powder by means of evaporation of a liquid medium at reduced 
pressure or at vacuum.

 
The system comprises heating chamber and an evacuation means, 

communicating with interior thereof. This provision enables creating of 
reduced pressure within the chamber, accompanied by evaporation of fluid 

medium at temperatures lower than needed for evaporation at normal 
pressure and evacuation of the moisture vapour, generated during 

evaporation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemical processing equipment, in
particular, to systems for converting into a uniform powder a liquid
feed which consists of a solution or suspension of particles in a fluid
medium.More particularly, the invention relates to so-called spray drying
systems for drying by evaporation of a fluid medium from the liquid
feed, after the feed is atomized and converted to the form of a cloud of
fine droplets with a large exposed surface. During evaporation the
fluid medium becomes a vapour which is evacuated from the system; the
particles which have been separated from the fluid medium fall from the
cloud in the form of a powder which can be collected from the system. Chemical processing plants for the drying of a liquid feed by means
of its spraying and evaporation have been known and successfully
practiced in special applications, particularly for the preparation of
aluminous porcelains, since the last quarter of the nineteenth century.Since the beginning of the twentieth century extensive application of
the spray drying process in a wide variety of industries has been
evident, e.g., in drying milk, soaps, detergents, pharmaceuticals,
organic and inorganic chemicals, etc.There are many known engineering monographs describing this process
and its peculiarities with respect to the spraying equipment design.
An example is W.R. Marshall's Atomization and Spray Drying, published by
the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 1954, or Ceramic Monographs
- Handbook of Ceramics, 1980 Verlag Schmid GmbH.The basic principles of the spray drying process include preparation
of the liquid feed, which is then atomized into a spray. This spray,
presented as a cloud of fine droplets, is projected into a stream of a
hot gas which is contained within a cylindrical chamber with a conical or
flat base. Drying by evaporation from the large exposed surface of the
spray is rapid, and the vapour driven off is extracted from the chamber
by means of cyclones, wet scrubbers or other appropriate equipment. The
drying process is terminated when moisture content in the dried particles
is reduced to the desired value and the particulated product is
discharged from the chamber. One of the additional advantages of spray drying systems is
associated with their versatility in that they operate both in a
continuous cycle without interruption as long as wet feed is supplied, as
well as in a batchwise manner if so desired.The main disadvantage of spray drying equipment implementing the
transfer of heat energy to
