<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a navigation
apparatus, which carries out an indication display of a present
position, an advance course, etc, to support a driving
operation of a movable body, such as a car. Especially, the
present invention relates to a navigation apparatus, to which
a destination position is firstly set and inputted, and which
obtains an optimum movement course on the basis of map
information inputted beforehand to display the course to
guide.In a navigation apparatus mounted in a vehicle etc., it
is demanded to measure a present position and an advance
direction of the self-vehicle precisely, display map
information corresponding to the present position of the
self-vehicle precisely and rapidly by a display device etc.,
one after another, and provide a driver with a course from the
present position to the destination position.The navigation apparatus mounted in a vehicle or car
etc., selects a course, which has an azimuth closest to the
azimuth from the present position to the destination position
of the self-vehicle, by use of position information as for the
inputted destination position and various courses to the 
destination position from the present position, so that the
navigation apparatus displays the advance course to guide from
the present position to the destination position.FIG. 11 indicates an example of a course searching
operation in case of using such a navigation apparatus. In
FIG. 11, the reference numeral S represents a present position,
the reference numeral D represents a destination position, and
the numbers 1 to 6 represent crossings through which the
self-vehicle are guided to pass respectively. In case of the
navigation apparatus, which selects the course having the
azimuth closest to the azimuth from the present position of the
self-vehicle to the destination position, when the destination
position D is inputted thereto, the navigation apparatus
displays such a course to guide that the self-vehicle advances
straight from the present position S to the crossing 3, turns
to the right at the crossing 3, turns to the left at the
crossing 4, turns to the right at the crossing 5 and turns to
the left at the crossing 6, so as to reach the destination
position D. In this manner, the navigation apparatus is
constructed to support the driving operation.However, in case of searching a course shown in FIG. 12
by use of such a navigation apparatus, since a course does not
exist between the present position S and the destination
position D, an infinite loop is generated
