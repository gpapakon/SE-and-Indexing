<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating incinerator waste gas which 
comprises feeding ammonium persulfate into the incinerator 

while waste gas is being led to the dust collector through 
the flue. The method may be modified such that ammonium 

persulfate is fed into the flue at its specific position 
where the temperature exceeds 400°C. The method may also 

be modified such that the waste gas discharged from the 
dust collector is further introduced into a catalytic 

denitrating unit. 
The method effectively reduces or removes dioxin, 
heavy metals, and NO
x
 in waste gas by the aid of a single 
additive, ammonium persulfate. Ammonium persulfate can be 

fed through only one port and requires only one feeding 
unit. Therefore, the method permits waste gas treatment 

in a simple manner with a simple system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for treating
incinerator exhaust gas and, more particularly, to a
method for purifying exhaust gas evolved by incineration
of wastes.Incineration is one way of disposing of municipal
wastes and sludge efficiently and sanitarily. However, it
gives off exhaust gas containing toxic substances such as
dioxin, heavy metals, and NOx. The exhaust gas has to be
treated for the removal or reduction of such toxic substances
before being discharged into the atmosphere.
There have been proposed several methods for treatment as
follows:
(1) One way of reducing dioxin is by adding a chemical
agent such as H2S, NH3, triethanolamine, and triethylamine
to the flue so as to prevent dioxin from being resynthesized
in the steps of waste heat recovery and waste gas
treatment. In addition, there is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-open No. 4918/1991 a method of adding an
oxidizing agent (such as O3 and H2O2) to the flue, thereby
oxidizing aromatic hydrocarbons and derivatives thereof 
(which are the precursors of dioxin resynthesis) into HCl,
CO2, and H2O.(2) One way of reducing heavy metals (such as mercury) is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Kohyo No. 504098/1991.
According to this disclosure, waste gas is brought into
contact with an aqueous solution or slurry containing one
or more than one metal sulfide (e.g., sodium sulfide), so
that gaseous heavy metals in waste gas are changed into
sulfides and have their partial vapor pressure reduced.
This increases the efficiency in removing heavy metals by
a dust collector (such as bag filter) in the subsequent
step.(3) One way of reducing NOx is by two-stage combustion.
This is described in "Kougai To Taisaku" (Vol. 114, No.5,
special edition featuring the anti-pollution measure for
sewage terminus treatment, "Measures against nitrogen
oxides resulting from sludge incineration", p. 40). In
addition, there is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
No. 141617/1992 a catalystless denitration process
which employs ammonia solution or urea solution.The conventional methods mentioned above are capable
of reducing the amount of dioxin, heavy metals, and NOx in
waste gas. However, they have a disadvantage of requiring
additives for respective toxic substances. In other
words, they need different additives according to the 
toxic substances to be reduced. Moreover, each additive has to be fed at a specific
position, and as many additive feeders as the number of additives are necessary. This
leads to a complex system for waste gas treatment which
