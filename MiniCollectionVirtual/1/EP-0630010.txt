<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of different pilot signal components 
are selectively superposed on an information signal, 

and mark signals which can indicate the types of pilot 
signals to be superposed are recorded, together with 

the information signal, on tracks on a recording 
medium, on which the pilot signals associated with the 

mark signals are recorded. The types of pilot signals 
can be quickly detected in a reproduction mode, and a 

satisfactory tracking control state is quickly achieved 
by modifying the tracking control signal. 
When the pilot signal components are superposed on 
the information signal on every other ones of a large 

number of parallel tracks, tracking error signals can 
be formed from reproduction signals from first and 

second heads for tracing neighboring tracks, and 
tracking control is executed using these tracking error 

signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
signal reproduction apparatus, which reproduces
information from a number of parallel tracks on a
recording medium and, more particularly, to one including
tracking control means. In particular the apparatus may
be a VTR for reproducing a video signal from oblique
tracks recorded and formed on a magnetic tape by a rotary
head.As conventional reproduction tracking methods for
home VTRs, the following two methods have been proposed
and put into practical applications. That is, one method
is a method (CTL) method of recording a vertical sync
signal separated from a recording signal upon recording
on a special-purpose control track formed along the
longitudinal direction of a tape using a stationary
magnetic head provided to a portion of a tape path. The
other method is a method (4fATF method) of obtaining a
tracking error signal by comparing 
crosstalk components reproduced from two neighboring
tracks of a reproduction track upon reproduction by
cyclically recording pilot signals having four
different relatively low frequencies to be superposed
on main signals such as a video signal, an audio
signal, and the like on a track for recording the main
signals using a rotary head for recording/reproducing
the main signals.However, the CTL method requires a space for the
stationary head, and is disadvantageous in
consideration of downsizing of a set. On the other
hand, the 4fATF method is advantageous for downsizing,
but requires a relatively complex circuit arrangement
since a large number of analog circuits are required
for four different pilot signals. In addition, in the
4fATF method, when the pilot signals are superposed on
a digital signal, since these signals occupy a
relatively broad frequency band, reliability of the
digital signal is undesirably impaired.On the other hand, in order to record/reproduce a
relatively large information amount to meet
requirements for high-image quality VTRs and digital
VTRs in recent home VTRs, a VTR which divisionally
records an image signal for one field on a plurality of
tracks has been developed, and a new tracking method
used in these VTRs has been examined. More
specifically, upon modulation of a digital signal to be 
recorded, a recording signal is recorded, so that a
modulated signal includes a frequency component
corresponding to a specific pilot signal, and with this
modulation, the pilot signal for tracking control is
multiplexed on a digital information signal.The reproduction apparatus of the present invention
is

every at least one track, and monotonically increases or
monotonically decreases in a plurality of tracks

corresponding to one of a frame and a field of the video
signal.
