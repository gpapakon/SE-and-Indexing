<ABSTRACT>
Bogie, especially for rail/road vehicles, with a small envelope space which permits even poor rails to be travelled on without the risk of derailing, can absorb impacts elastically and is of uncomplicated constructional design, the objective being achieved according to the invention in that the bogie is constructed as a torsionally flexible bogie with the suspension for the bogie bolster 4 arranged at the corners and the connection device between the bogie bolster 4 and the underframe 14 of the road vehicle is fastened on an activation carrier 5, the lifting devices 16 which are used being mounted offset on this activation carrier 5 and the activation carrier 5 being connected via a torsionally rigid rocker 10 to the underframe 14 of the road vehicle. The bogie with the bogie bolster 4 which is spring mounted at four corners can be positioned for example under low platform wagons, and this bogie with the connection device can be used under road vehicles to permit them to travel on rails.

<CLAIMS>
Bolster-type bogie, especially for rail/road 
vehicles, essentially formed by a frame (1), a bolster 

(4), bolster springing (2), with a device arranged 
between the bolster and the vehicle frame (14) and 

comprising an actuating support (5) and a lifting device 
(16) and rocker (10) arranged between the actuating 

support and the vehicle frame, the bogie frame (1) being 
of torsionally flexible design and the bolster (4) being 

embedded between the crossmembers (24) and longitudinal 
members (25) within the installation space of the bogie 

frame (1), and upward-sloping springs (2), which rest by 
means of rests (3) against the bolster (4), being 

arranged in the corners of the bogie frame (1), and a 
bogie pivot (6) of the actuating support (5) resting on 

a pivot bearing (7) of the bogie (4), and sliders (20) 
being arranged at the transverse centre (8a), on both 

aides of the longitudinal centre (8b), on the bolster 
(4), between the bolster (4) and the actuating support 

(5), and brackets (9) being arranged at the transverse 
centre (8a), on both sides of the longitudinal centre 

(8b), on the actuating support (5), these brackets each 
holding one rocker arm (10a) of a rocker (10) by means of 

pins (11), the rocker arms (10a) being connected to one 
another in torsionally rigid fashion at their other ends, 

and the rocker (10) being connected in articulated 
fashion to the underframe (14) of the road vehicle via 

brackets (13) by way of an articulated joint (12), and, 
on the actuating support (5), on both sides of the 

longitudinal centre (8b) but offset in relation to the 
transverse centre (8a), lifting devices (16) being  

 
attached in articulated fashion to brackets (15) by means 

of pins (17) and, at their other ends, by way of pins 
(18) and brackets (19) to the underframe (14) of the road 

vehicle. 
Bogie according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the outer edges (26) of the springs lie to the outside of 

the flange-mounting planes (22) of the wheels (23). 
Bogie according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
two sets of two lifting devices (16) are arranged on the 

actuating support (5) symmetrically to the longitudinal 
centre (8b) and to the transverse centre (8a) of the 

bolster (4).
