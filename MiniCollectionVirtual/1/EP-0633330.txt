<ABSTRACT>
A contact-making device (22) for a printed circuit board frame of an electroplating installation is described, the contact-making device (22) being designed to make contact with a corresponding printed circuit board (20) by means of contact members. The contact-making device (22) has two rod elements (24, 26) spaced with respect to one another which are linked to one another by spacer elements (28). The first rod element (24) is provided with contact clamps (34) from which first contact members project. The second rod element (26) has spring elements (42) projecting therefrom in the direction towards the first rod element (24), each of which spring elements is provided with at least one second contact member. The contact surfaces (40, 58) of matching contact member pairs are forced against one another by means of the associated spring element (42).
