<ABSTRACT>
In the region of the glass rebate (7), there are inserted heat-insulating bars (11, 12) or pieces which extend from the two pane seals (9, 10) of the sash-frame/leaf-frame profile (1) to almost as far as the insulating webs (4) which bound the glass rebate (7). The heat-insulating bars (11, 12) or pieces rest on the profile webs, parallel to the pane borders, such that the glass-rebate cross-section, on the outside of the pane and on the inside of the pane, is bounded essentially by the heat-insulating bars or pieces and the associated glass seals.

A frame for a window, a door or a facade, the bars of which consist of thermally 
insulated aluminium composite sections, and which comprises a surrounding glass 

rebate which is delimited by at least one insulating stay joining the outer shell to the 
inner shell of each bar and in which the edges of a pane, of a panel or the like fit, 

which edges are sealed by seals seated against the outer and inner shells of the 
composite section, characterised in that in the glass rebate region (7) of the composite 

section frame the pane or panel edges are covered over their length on the inside and 
outside by two thermal insulation pieces (11, 12) or thermal insulation bars which are 

made of insulating material, which in cross-section fit round the longitudinal edges 
of the pane or of the panel (6) at a distance from each other, and which extend, in 

the cross-section of the glass rebate, from the inner and outer glass seals (9, 10) as 
closely as possible towards the insulating stay (4) of the composite section (1) which 

delimits the glass rebate, in such a way that on the inside and outside of the pane the 
glass rebate cross-section is substantially delimited by the thermal insulation pieces 

or bars (11, 12) and by the associated glass seals. 
A frame according to claim 1, characterised in that, as seen in the glass rebate cross-section, 
a thermal insulation bar of one-piece construction or a one-piece thermal 

insulation piece (11, 12) is provided which continuously or regionally fits round the 
longitudinal edges of the pane or panel (6), and that the partial faces of the bar or 

piece (11, 12) which are opposite the glass edge joint (23) are at least regionally set 
back in relation to the glass edge joint (23) or are provided with holes or similar 

recesses for the purpose of forming a water drainage and/or a glass rebate ventilation 
system. 
A frame according to claims 1 to 2, characterised in that the thermal insulation bars 
or pieces (11, 12) are of L-shaped or angled construction in cross-section.  

 
A frame according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the thermal 
insulation bars or pieces (11, 12) are constructed as solid bars which are substantially 

continuous over the length of the composite section. 
A frame according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the thermal 
insulation bar (11) or piece associated with the outer glass seal (9) is constructed as 

a hollow section and the bar or piece (12) associated with the inner glass seal (10) is 
constructed as a solid part. 
A frame according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the glass 
seals (9, 10) each form a one-piece, preferably co-extruded, plastic moulding with the 

thermal insulation bars (11, 12) or pieces associated with the same rebate side. 
A frame according to claim 1, characterised in that the cavity delimited by the 
insulating stays (3, 4) of the composite section (1) and/or the cavity delimited by the 

insulating stays (15, 16) of the composite section (13) of the casement and/or window 
frame is filled in a thermally insulating manner with a thermoplastic body or with a 

granular insulating material or with a prefabricated moulding in the form of a length. 
A frame according to claim 1 in which a web-like central seal is provided in the 
central rebate between the window casement and the window frame, characterised in 

that at least one moulding (18) made of a thermally insulating material is associated 
with the central seal (20). 
A frame according to claim 8, characterised in that two mouldings (18, 19) in the 
form of lengths are associated with the central seal (20) and are fixed on both sides 

to the part of the central seal (20) associated with the insulating stay (15). 
A frame according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the mouldings (18, 19) are 
integrally formed on the central seal (20) in one piece or are constructed separately 

therefrom.  
 
A frame according to claim 8, charactcrised in that a further central seal (21) which 
is disposed on the insulating stay (IS) of the window frame section is associated with 

the central seal (20), and that the insulating stay (3) of the window casement is bent 
at right angles in such a way that the outer central seal (20) strikes against a rib part 

of the insulating stay (3) and the inner central seal (21) strikes against a sectional rib 
of the inner shell (5) of the composite section (1) of the window casement in the 

closed position of the latter. 
A frame according to claim 11, characterised in that the free space situated between 
the central seals (20, 21) is at least partially filled by an insulating length (22) or the 

like. 
A frame according to claim 10, characterised in that the central seal (21) is disposed 
on the side facing the window frame inner shell (17) of the composite section (13), 

and that a moulding (21') fastened to said central seal extends into the region of the 
window frame outer shell. 
A frame according to any one of the preceding claims 8-13, characterised in that the 
cavity which is delimited by the central seals (20, 21) and/or the mouldings (18, 19) 

and by the associated insulating stay (15) of the composite section (13) of the window 
frame is substantially filled with a body made of a thermally insulating material.
