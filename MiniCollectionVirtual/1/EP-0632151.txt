<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a warp-beam flange with a clamping ring (3), tensionable via at least one clamping screw (8), for the releaseable clamping of the flange (1) screwed together with the clamping ring (3) onto a warp-beam tube. To simplify production, it is proposed, according to the invention, that the clamping ring (3) fastened to the flange outer face (1a) via at least two axial fastening screws (6) be supported directly on the flange outer face (1a) via at least two circumferentially offset bearings (4) forming respectively between them a clamping gap (9) in the form of a segment of a circle, and that at least two axial clamping screws (8) be arranged circumferentially offset in the region of the clamping gaps (9), in such a way that a tightening of the clamping screws (8) in the clamping-gap region reduces the clear axial distance between the clamping ring (3) and the flange outer face (1a) and thereby generates flank pressure in the thread engagement.

Warp beam flange having a clamping ring (3), which is 
fastenable by means of at least two axial fastening 

screws (6) to the flange outer surface (1a) and is 
clampable by means of at least one clamping screw (8) 

for releasable clamping of the flange (1) which is 
screwable together with the clamping ring (3) onto a 

warp beam tube, characterized in that flange (1) and 
clamping ring (3) have a continuous internal thread 

(10), that the clamping ring (3) is supported directly 
against the flange outer surface (1a) by means of at 

least two bearings (4), which are arranged in a 
peripherally offset manner and between them form in 

each case a clamping gap (9) in the shape of a segment 
of a circle, and that at least two axial clamping 

screws (8) are disposed in a peripherally offset 
manner in the region of the clamping gaps (9) in such 

a way that a tightening of the clamping screws (8) in 
the clamping gap region reduces the inside axial 

clearance between clamping ring (3) and flange outer 
surface (1a) and therefore gives rise to a flank 

compression in the thread engagement. 
Warp beam flange according to claim 1, characterized 
in that each fastening screw (6) is passed through a 

bearing (4). 
Warp beam flange according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by two bearings (4) each peripherally 

offset by 120° relative to one another. 
Warp beam flange according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized by three clamping screws (8) each 

peripherally offset by 120° relative to one another.  
 
Warp beam flange according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the axial height of the 

bearings (4) is 2 to 4 mm. 
Warp beam flange according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the threaded holes (7, 

5) for the fastening and clamping screws (6, 8) are 
cored in the flange (1). 
Warp beam flange according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bearings (4) are 

provided on the flange outer surface (1a). 
Warp beam flange according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the screw heads (6a, 8a) 

are arranged so as to be countersunk in the clamping 
ring (3). 
Warp beam flange according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the clamping ring (3) 

lies inside an annular groove (2) in the flange outer 
surface (1a). 
Method of manufacturing a warp beam flange according 
to claim 1, wherein the as yet unmachined clamping 

ring (3) is connected to the flange (1) and then 
machined jointly with said flange in that, in a single 

operation, an internal bore extending through flange 
(1) and clamping ring (3) is manufactured and then 

said bore is provided with a continuous internal 
thread (10).
