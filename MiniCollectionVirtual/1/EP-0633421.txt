<ABSTRACT>
The present specification discloses a support 
system for an equipment housing (10), said support 

system including a pair of screw-adjustable legs (20) 
at one end (14) of the housing and a pivoting trestle 

(22) at one end (14) of the housing and a pivoting 
trestle (22) at the other end. The pivoting trestle 

is made of two generally U-shaped members, (34,36) one 
channel member being inverted and inserted or mounted 

inside the other channel member. The channel members 
each have side walls (40,44), and a bolt (56) extends 

through apertures (50,52) in the side walls to 
pivotally mount one channel with respect to the other. 

The housing can be made horizontal, i.e., "levelled" 
by adjusting the effective length of the two legs 

(20), and the trestle automatically pivots to 
accommodates adjustment to the legs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
supporting a housing on a surface. More particularly the present invention relates 
to a support system which can easily be adjusted so 
that the housing is substantially parallel. Some equipment, such as medical diagnostic equipment, 
must be horizontal to achieve optimum performance. The 
equipment is normally mounted or secured within a housing. 
Legs are typically used at the four corners of the housing 
with the length of each leg adjusted as necessary using 
threaded screw mechanisms to make the housing horizontal. Most people have experienced the use of unstable 
tables or chairs -- these devices may be unstable because 
the chair or table legs are slightly different in length or 
because the legs rest on an uneven surface. The same 
problem is present in equipment housings. If an equipment 
housing has four or more screw-adjustable legs, the length 
of each leg must be adjusted precisely with respect to the 
other legs. A table or chair with three legs would not suffer from 
this lack of stability. From a geometrical analysis, the 
table or chair is supported at a fixed distance from each 
of three points defined by the bottom of the legs. An 
equipment housing could also be supported with desirable 
stability if only three screw-adjustable legs were used. 
However, equipment housings are typically rectangular. If 
two legs were used adjacent one end and the third leg 
adjacent the other end of the housing, the third leg would 
generally support approximately one-half of the total 
weight assuming that the weight is uniformly distributed 
within the housing.  An aim of the present invention is to provide a 
system for supporting an equipment housing so that the 
equipment housing can easily "levelled", i.e., 
adjusted to be horizontal. Another aim is to provide an easy-levelling 
support system without the disadvantage of using three 
adjustable-length legs. According to the present invention there is 
provided a support system for a housing which housing 
has first and second ends, the support system 
characterized by:
 
   an elongated member having a central portion;
 
   means for pivotally connecting the central 
portion of the elongated member to the housing 
adjacent the second end thereof so that the elongated 
member is generally horizontal; and
 
   two adjustable-length legs mounted to the housing 
adjacent the first end thereof.
 
   Preferably the elongated member includes a first 
extruded metal channel member and the means for 
pivotal

<CLAIMS>
A support system for a housing (10) which housing 
has first (12) and second (14) ends, the support system 

characterized by: 
   an elongated member (36) having a central portion 

(46); 
   means (34, 56) for pivotally connecting the 

central portion (46) of the elongated member to the housing 
adjacent the second end (14) thereof so that the elongated 

member is generally horizontal; and 
   two adjustable-length legs (20) mounted to the 

housing adjacent the first end thereof. 
A support system as claimed in claim 1: 
   wherein said elongated member (36) is a first 

generally U-shaped channel and said means for pivotally 
connecting includes a second, generally U-shaped channel 

(34); 
   said second channel being inverted and said first 

channel is pivotally mounted within said second channel. 
A support system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the adjustable-length legs (20) are aligned 

substantially parallel to the elongated member. 
A support system as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the elongated member (36) comprises a first 

extruded metal channel member having a floor panel (42) and 
opposed side panels (44) which are connected to the floor 

panel. 
A support system as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 
4, wherein the central portion (46) of the elongated member 

(36) has side panels (44) with apertures therethrough (52). 
A support system as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
wherein the central portion (46) of the elongated member 

(36) has side panels (44) with apertures therethrough, and 
wherein the means for pivotally connecting further comprises 

a second extruded metal channel member (34) having a 
floor panel (38) and opposed side panels (40) connected to 

the floor panel, the second channel member side panels 
having apertures therethrough (50); and a connector (56) 

which extends through the apertures in the side panels of 
the elongated member and the second channel member. 
A support system as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
the side panels (44) of the elongated member (36) are 

spaced apart a lesser distance than the spacing between the 
side panels (40) of the second channel member (34), and the 

second channel member (34) is inserted within the elongated 
member. 
A support system as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7, 
wherein the apertures (52) in the side panels (44) of the 

elongated member (36) are disposed at the central portion 
(46) thereof, and wherein the side panels of the elongated 

member have a reduced height (48) except at said central 
portion. 
A support system as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the adjustable-length legs (20) include 

threaded adjustment means (24, 32).
