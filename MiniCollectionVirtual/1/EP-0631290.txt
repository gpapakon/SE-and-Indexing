<ABSTRACT>
A processing plant and a method for operating 
the same, in which a spent fuel or an amount of the 

constituent materials of a fluid in the process and the 
effect of those materials on troubles are recognized and 

evaluated to thereby control the operation conditions of 
the reprocessing plant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
method of operation of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.As an existent operation method for a
reprocessing plant, there has been known, as described in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication JP-A 63-180894 (1988),
a solvent extraction process for bringing a nitric acid
solution containing nuclear fuel materials and fission
products into contact with an organic solvent and
separating the nuclear fuel materials to the side of an
organic phase and the fission products to the side of an
aqueous phase, in which the concentration of nitric acid
in a solvent extraction device is measured and the
concentration of nitric acid is controlled such that the
concentrations of the aimed nuclides in the organic phase
and the aqueous phase are controlled, to improve the
quality of the products.Further, there has been known, as described in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication JP-A 63-0 27796 (1988),
a criticality control device for a reprocessing plant, in
which the maximum value for the concentration of nuclear
materials in a spent solvent is forecast based on
composition conditions of a solution to be processed and
operation conditions, to determine whether the maximum
value of the concentration of the nuclear materials
exceeds a limit value or not, for minimizing a
discontinuous period of time in view of operational
procedures or diluting the solution to be processed if
the limit value is exceeded, in the control of
criticality accidents which should never be caused.Further, there has been known, as described in
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 34718/1991 and
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 34719/1991, a
separation and recovery device for separating recovered
uranium and natural uranium recovered in a reprocessing
plant into enriched uranium and depleted uranium and
recovering them, in which the concentration of uranium
isotopes in enriched uranium is measured to control the
amount of recovered uranium and natural uranium supplied,
or the ratio of the recovered uranium to natural uranium
supplied is controlled based on the result of calculation
in a calculation control section, thereby improving the
quality of enriched uranium or reducing the enriching
cost, although they are not the reprocessing plant per
se. Further, for the safety of the reprocessing
plant, it has not been considered to employ such a
process constitution and an equipment structure as having
a sufficient margin to material corrosion or the like
and, in particular, to control the operation

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of operation of a nuclear fuel
reprocessing plant in which a solution of nuclear fuel

from a nuclear reactor is subjected to reprocessing
steps, including performing at least once the sequence

of steps:-

(i) obtaining a value of the amount of a component
in said solution from composition data relating to said

solution being reprocessed from one of (a) the
performance of the nuclear reactor in the production of

the fuel in the solution and (b) measurement performed
on the solution in the reprocessing plant,
(ii) evaluating from said value of the amount of
said component the degree of risk of occurrence of a

phenomenon liable to cause a malfunctioning of the
plant, on the basis of a predetermined relationship between the

amount of said component and the likelihood of
occurrence of said phenomenon, and
(iii) controlling at least one device of said
reprocessing plant so as to reduce the concentration in said solution of said component, thereby reducing said degree of risk

when the evaluated degree of risk exceeds a
predetermined level,

   in which in a said sequence (I) of said steps (i)
to (iii) said malfunctioning is clogging of a pipeline

in said plant due to said component, said phenomenon is
precipitation of a material containing said component, 

and said degree of risk of said phenomenon corresponds
to the amount of precipitation of said material

containing said component.
A method according to claim 1, in which in
said sequence (I) said component is phosphoric acid,

molybdenum, zirconium, iron, barium or NO - / 3.
A method according to claim 1 or 2
including a further said sequence (II) of said steps (i)

to (iii) in which said malfunctioning is caused by
corrosion of a constituent material of said plant, said

phenomenon is the corrosion of said constituent material
of said plant, and said degree of risk of said

phenomenon corresponds to the amount of the corrosion of
said constituent material of said plant.
A method according to claim 3, in which in said
sequence (II) said component is iron, octavalent ruthenium or

hexavalent chromium.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4
including a further said sequence (III) of said steps

(i) to (iii) in which said malfunctioning is leakage of 
at least one volatilized radioactive nuclide, said

phenomenon is volatilization of said radioactive nuclide
and said degree of risk of said phenomenon corresponds

to the amount of volatilization of said radioactive
nuclide.
A method according to claim 5, in which said
radioactive nuclide is ruthenium, technetium or caesium.
