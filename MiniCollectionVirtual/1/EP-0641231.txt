IONTOPHORETIC DRUG DELIVERY DEVICE AND CIRCUIT THEREFORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to iontophoretic devices for delivering a drug or medicant to a patient transdermally, i.e., through the patient's skin, and more specificall relates to an iontophoretic device having one or more segmented electrodes and current delivery circuits therefor.Description of the Prior Art Conventional iontophoretic devices, such as described iU.S. Patent No. 4,820,263 which issued to Richard Spevak e al., for delivering a drug or medicant transdermally, basically consists of two electrodes â€” an anode and cathode. Electric current is driven from an external suppl into the patient's skin at the anode, and back out at th cathode. Most modern iontophoretic devices are powered by constant current source to ensure that the current is kept a a desired level despite differences in skin impedance amon individuals.Electrode structures for iontophoretic devices generall have an active electrode (for example, the anode) whic delivers the ionic medication, and an indifferent electrod (for example, the cathode) with an electrolyte. The activ and indifferent electrodes are connected to the skin forming a circuit. The current passes from a power source through on of the electrodes to the skin, through the skin and into th subdermal tissue, back out through the skin at a separat location and then through the other electrode. Regulation o the rate of drug delivery has been controlled by the amount o current flow.It has been found in such iontophoretic devices that ski irritation is related to the current density of the applie 

current. Densities below 200 ua/cm2 are considered as generally being non-irritating. Current densities above that figure are often associated with skin irritation.A typical iontophoresis system may include electrodes (an anode and a cathode) which are each 5 square centimeters in size through which a total current of 1 milliamperes is driven. At such values, an average current density of 200 ua/cm2 is applied to the skin.If the skin varies considerably in resistance over the area of the electrodes, the peak current densities in different areas of the skin under the electrodes may be considerably higher than the average current density. It has been found that these variations in current density may be as much as 5 or 10 to 1, that is, a more conductive skin area can run at a current density of as much as 10 times the average current density, causing skin irritation or
