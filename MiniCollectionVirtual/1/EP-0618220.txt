<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of purifying interleukin-4. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a lymphokine (stimulator of the immune 
system) that has a broad range of immune-cell stimulatory activities 
[Banchereau et al., Lymphokine Res. Vol. 6, No. 1:U135 (1987); Yokoto et 
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83: 5894-5898 (1986); Lee at al., Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA, 83: 2061-2065 (1986); Coffman et al., J. Immunol. 136: 949-954 
(1986); Sanderson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83: 437-440 
(1986); Grabstein et al., J. Exp. Med., 163: 1405-1413 (1985); and Vitetta et 
al., J. Exp. Med. 162: 1726-1731 (1985)]. At various times, IL-4 has also 
been referred to as B-cell growth factor (BCGF) [Butler et al., J. Immunol. 
133: 251-255 (1984)(human BCGF); and Farrar et al., J. Immunol. 131: 
1838-1842 (1983)(mouse BCGF)] and B-cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) 
[Ohara et al., J. Immunol. 135: 2518-2523 (1985)]. The name interleukin-4 
was finally proposed and adopted in 1986 [Sanderson et al., Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA, 83: 437-440 (1986)]. IL-4 was originally thought to be important only for the costimulation 
of activated B-cells [Roehm, et al., J. Exp. Med. 160:679-694 
(1984)]. It has also been shown, however, to modulate the activities of T-cells 
and mast cells [Mosmann, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA. 83:5654-5658(1986)]. 
See also WO 87/0290, where the activity of IL-4 as a T-cell  
 
growth factor and B-cell growth factor is described as being useful to 
enhance natural defenses against various infections. T-cells and B-cells act in the later stages of an immune response. 
It would be highly advantageous to have an agent which would increase 
and activate neutrophils which act in the early stages of infection and are the 
body's first line of defense against infection. In the normal process of white blood cell hematopoiesis, cells 
originate in the bone marrow from a primitive immature cell known as a stem 
cell and differentiate through progressively more mature stages along 
different lineage pathways, to arrive at a terminal state of differentiation as a 
monocyte, granulocyte or lymphocyte. A property of immature, undifferentiated cells is the ability to 
multiply rapidly. It is only when a precursor cell matures and differentiates 
through these multiple stages that it generally loses its capacity to proliferate 
and assumes the role of a specialized, functional mature cell. In the normal 
state, cells that reach their final mature form do not proliferate to any great 
extent, if at all.

interleukin-4, comprising 


(a) Charging said crude solution of IL-4 buffered at a neutral
