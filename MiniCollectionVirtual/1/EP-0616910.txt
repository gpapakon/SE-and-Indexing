<ABSTRACT>
Anti-slip device applicable to automobile wheels. It 
is made up an elongate rectangular member -1- provided at 

its ends with two arms -2- and -3-, one of which can 
articulate in an "F" direction, adopting a configuration 

similar to a "U", suitable for clamping around the wheel 
-5-. 
The purpose of the device is to prevent automobile 
wheels skidding on mud, sand or similar surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-slip device 
applicable to the wheels of automobiles. More specifically, the invention consists of a device 
especially designed to prevent vehicle wheels skidding on 
mud, sand or similar surfaces, allowing the wheels to 
rotate with traction under such adverse conditions for a 
sufficient distance to emerge from the obstacle. The device is designed for the above uses, although it 
could also be applied effectively for driving on snow and 
ice, utilizing for that purpose several units per wheel. Along general lines, the device comprises a main 
rectangular member which is attached transversally across 
the tread of the tyre. This member is provided with a 
surface made up of nylon, iron or rubber relief projections 
or studs which make contact with the ground. The ends of 
the member have respective metallic arms which are secured 
to the wheel rim, one of these arms being articulated to 
facilitate the fitting and removal procedure for the 
device. In order to aid understanding, the present description 
is accompanied by a sheet of drawings showing an embodiment 
of the device by way of example. In the drawings: Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device of the 
invention. Figure 2 shows the device fitted to the wheel of an 
automobile, the wheel being shown in section. Figure 3 shows a wheel equipped with the device. With reference to the figures, the embodiment shows an 
anti-slip device for automobile wheels, comprising a mainelongate 
rectangular member -1-, provided at the ends 
thereof with two arms -2- and -3-, one of which has a hinge 
-4- at its joint with the member -1-, which permits 
articulation of the arm in the direction "F". The device as 
a whole is provided with a configuration similar to a "U",  
 
suitable for clamping around the wheel -5-, as illustrated 
in Figures 2 and 3, to which end the arms -2- and -3- have 
feet -6- at their ends, bent at an angle, which feet are 
fixed onto the profile of the wheel rim -7-, this 
arrangement being facilitated by the articulated outer arm 
-3- and by the special geometry of the arms, which fit 
around the side walls of the tyre. The member -1- is provided with nylon, iron or rubber 
studs -8- to enhance grip. The arms -2- and -3- are of 
metallic material, preferably aluminium or iron, while the 
two feet -6- bear respective parts -9- made of nylon or 
similar material.

<CLAIMS>
Anti-slip device applicable to automobile wheels, 
characterized essentially in that it is made up of a "U"-shaped 

body whose base (1) is formed by a rectangular 
member having a surface provided with studs (8) havi
ng an 
anti-slip function, with one of the arms (3) of said "U" 

being provided at its union with the aforesaid base (1) 
with a hinge (4) which permits it to swivel in order to 

facilitate fitting of the device on the wheel of the 
vehicle, in such a way that the said base (1) is situated 

transversally to the tyre tread, in a position to contact 
the ground. 
The anti-slip device applicable to automobile 
wheels of Claim 1, characterized in that the two arms (2) 

and (3) are provided at each of their open ends with feet 
(6) which engage the wheel rim profile. 
The anti-slip device applicable to automobile 
wheels of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the 

functional position of foot (6) of the arm can be adjusted 
to fit all types of wheel rims. 
The anti-slip device applicable to automobile 
wheels of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the arm (2) 

is of a shorter length than that of the arm (3) and lacks 
the corresponding foot (6), so that it does not obstruct 

the disc brakes of the wheel. 
The anti-slip device applicable to automobile 
wheels of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the side of 

the member (1) in contact with the tread of the tyre (5) is 
provided with a plurality of relief parts which fit into 

the incut pattern of said tread in order to facilitate 
positioning of the said member (1).
