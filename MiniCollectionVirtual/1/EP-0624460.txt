<ABSTRACT>
A laminated wrapping material comprising a base material, a silicon oxide layer, an adhesive layer or an anchor-coat layer, 
and a heat sealing resin layer that are laminated in that order, wherein said adhesive layer or anchor-coat layer are formed by applying 

an aqueous adhesive composition or aqueous anchor coating agent composition onto said silicon oxide layer and then drying 
the same. A solvent-free type adhesive layer may be provided on said anchor-coat layer. A laminated wrapping material comprising 

a base material, a silicon oxide layer, an ink layer, an adhesive layer and a heat sealing resin layer that are laminated in 
that order, wherein said ink layer is formed by applying an aqueous ink composition onto said silicon oxide layer and then drying 

the same. In this case, it is preferable that the adhesive layer is formed by applying an aqueous adhesive composition onto the ink 
layer and then drying the same. In addition, in a case where a substance having oiliness is used as an ink composition, it is preferable 

that the anchor-coat layer is formed by applying an aqueous anchor coating agent composition onto the silicon oxide layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminated packaging
material useful as a packaging material for food, having a
silicon oxide layer as a layer with gas barrier
properties, in particular, oxygen and water-vapor barrier
properties. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a laminated packaging material having superior
oxygen barrier properties and water-vapor barrier
properties even when it has a thin silicon oxide layer.
The present invention also relates to a laminated
packaging material having a silicon oxide deposited layer
serving as a barrier to oxygen, water vapor, etc., and
also having superior adhesion and transparency of a
printed layer. The present invention still also provides
a laminated packaging material having a silicon oxide
deposited layer serving as a barrier to gases such as
oxygen and water vapor and also having superior laminate
bond strength.Packaging materials for food, as exemplified by
pouch materials for retort food, having been hitherto in
wide use are bags formed of a laminated packaging material 
comprising a polyester film as a substrate, an aluminum
foil as a barrier layer and a thermoplastic resin film
provided for heat sealing which are successively
laminated, the whole surfaces of the bags being provided
with prints to improve their decorative effect.However, conventional materials in which aluminum
foil is laminated can not be used in microwave ovens and
also have the problems that the production cost of the
laminated packaging material is held by the aluminum foil
in a high proportion. They have another problem that
aluminum oxide turns into lumps upon thermal disposal of
the laminated packaging materials making use of aluminum
foil and remains as residues. Accordingly, a light-transmissive
silicon oxide deposited layer formed in a
thickness of 1,500 to 1,800 angstroms is available as a
substitute for aluminum foil (Japanese Patent Publications
No. 51-48511 and No. 52-3418).Recently, making the most of the properties inherent
in the laminated packaging material having such a light-transmissive
silicon oxide deposited layer as an oxygen
and water-vapor barrier layer, i.e., the properties that
it causes no problem in its disposal as in aluminum foil
and its contents can be seen from the outside, it is
attempted to use this material as packaging materials for
food such as confectionery and for medical supplies, other 
than packaging materials for retort food.However, the light-transmissive silicon oxide
deposited layer with a thickness of 1,500 to 1,800 Ã…
