<ABSTRACT>
A smoke/pollution detection apparatus embodying a manifold valve assembly (11) including four inlet ports leading into a spreader cone (12) for deflecting gas/airstream, drawn from a plurality of zones under surveillance through a pipe reticulation system comprising a plurality of pipes communicating with said zones, from the manifold (11) around the top of a dust filter (10). A valve means including a reciprocating, rotating matching thin conical bell (14) situated over the cone (12) may be raised to an upward position where a hole (15) is arranged to be aligned with one of the ports such that the others are blocked, and gas/airstream from the particular pipe joined to the open port is sampled. Selective closing of the inlet ports to the assembly (11) allows the locality of a zone of any detected smoke/pollution to be quickly identified by the apparatus and in which all ports to the apparatus remain open under normal circumstances (no pollution detected) and all monitored zones remain coupled to a detector and there is no power drawn nor any movement of any parts including the valve means in the inoperative condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO SMOKF DETECTION SCANNINGAPPARATUS The present invention relates to a pollution/smoke detection apparatus incorporating an aspirated gas reticulation system connected to a large number of sampling points in which gas from a number of monitored spaces is drawn for testing.It is normal in such systems for the pipe reticulation system to be jointed at a manifold which incorporates a dust filter prior to exposure of the gas to smoke/pollution detection equipment in a sampling chamber. A known multi-port manifold preferably includes four equally spaced ports receiving gas samples carried to the ports by a pipe reticulation system.A search of prior art records reveal several attempts at early warning techniques by way of identifying the specific area or zone from which pollution is being sourced. Australian Patent No. 624097 relates to a fire alarm system including a plurality of slave fire detectors and a master detector to transmit a signal to a central receiving unit.U.S. Patent No. 2,660,052 (Uhl) relates to testing of successively withdrawn samples from a plurality of sources for testing and purging the system with clean air to avoid contamination between sources. This is a continuous process.U.S. Patent No. 1 ,755,834 (Marr) provides for several observation cabinets allowing for visual determination of those cabinets through which smoke is actually present. U.S. Patent No. 3,678,487 (Ludewig) discloses a rotary selector valve provided for continuously drawing off samples from zones and subjected to detection apparatus.French Patent No. 2670010 (Cerberus) discloses detection devices in each supply line from different zones. U.S. Patent No. 3,678,488 (Skala) discloses a condensate nuclei monitor which is selectively switched from one zone to another to monitor condensate in each zone respectively with individual adjustment of sensitivity for each zone. 

 Because the air samples may be drawn from a relatively large area in a building or even from separate buildings, it is desirable in an early warning smoke/pollution detection system for early identification of the specific area or zone from which the smoke/pollution is sourced. This can be achieved by identifying the specific pipe or pipes attached to the manifold that are carrying smoke/polluted air and thereby narrows the search for the potential fire or fire. The above-mentioned prior specifications make an attempt at such early identification and localisation. Such identification will also enable utilisation of a monitoring

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. In a smoke/pollution detection apparatus a manifold valve device adapted to receive gas/air drawn from a plurality of zones under surveillance through a reticulation pipe system comprising a plurality of pipes communicating with said zones, said manifold valve device being connected to a plurality of pipes for receiving said gas/air, valve means selectively closing one or some of said inlet ports to the manifold valve device, the arrangement being such that the locality of a zone of any detected smoke/pollution can be quickly identified, wherein all ports to the manifold valve apparatus remain open in normal circumstances such that all monitored zones remain coupled to the detector and the manifold valve means is inoperative thereby drawing negligible or no power until such time as the smoke/pollution is detected.
2. A manifold apparatus for use in a smoke/pollution detection apparatus in which gas/air is drawn from a plurality of areas to a location adjacent to the manifold apparatus in which the manifold apparatus includes a plurality of inlet ports each connected to one of said plurality of areas by a gas/air conduit for receiving said gas/air, valve means for selectively closing one or some inlet ports in rotation, the arrangement being such that the area source of any detected smoke/pollution can be identified wherein under normal circumstances ali ports to the manifold apparatus remain open such that all monitored areas are coupled to the detector and the valve means is inoperative.
3. A manifold apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said valve device is reciprocally and rotationally mounted relative to a plurality of inlet ports in the manifold in which said valve device includes one port which is adapted to communicate with each of said plurality of manifold ports such that a sample is drawn into said manifold one port at a time to enable identification of any positive sample that has been detected by said smoke detector.
