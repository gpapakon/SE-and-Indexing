<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for measuring the output of shot in a shot-blasting generator, characterised in that it comprises, inserted between a pipe and a reservoir of the generator, a casing (6) rising up vertically and at its top part including means (23) for outflow of shot coming from the reservoir, whilst its bottom part is directly connected to the pipe, there being mounted, inside the casing (6) so that it can slide vertically against the action of a calibrated spring, a piston (63), the top end of which is integral with a head (67) situated in line with the means (23) for outflow of shot, means being provided for measuring the displacements of the piston (63) under the weight of the shot coming from the reservoir and the pipe including branches emerging in the reservoir and in the casing (6).
