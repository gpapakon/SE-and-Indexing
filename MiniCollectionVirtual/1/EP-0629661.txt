<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
thermoplastic resin composition capable of providing a 
molded product which is well-balanced in properties such 
as impact resistance and heat resistance and which has a 
uniformly and closely delustered surface. Amorphous resins such as polystyrene resins 
(aromatic vinyl polymers), AS resins (vinyl cyanide-aromatic 
vinyl copolymers), polycarbonate resins, ABS 
resins (vinyl cyanide-conjugated diene type rubber-aromatic 
vinyl copolymers), AES resins (vinyl cyanide-ethylene/propylene 
type rubber-aromatic vinyl 
copolymers) and polyphenylene ether resins are 
used in various fields including motor vehicles, light 
electrical appliances, miscellaneous goods and so on 
because of their excellent moldability, impact 
resistance, rigidity and excellent surface gloss. However, all of these properties are not always 
necessary depending on the intended uses. For example, 
in the fields of automobile interior parts, office or 
household electrical appliances there is a 
demand for materials such as polystyrene resins,  
 
polycarbonate resins or ABS resins which are improved in 
properties to reduce the surface gloss of the molded 
article for providing a uniformly and closely matted 
surface without impairing other mechanical and chemical 
properties. The purposes of using these materials are 
various and are, for instance, to prevent automobile 
interior parts from reflecting light in the night for 
safety or to provide electrical appliances with high 
grade appearance in view of the current trend toward high 
grade products. It has been heretofore known to deluster the 
surface of molded products by adding a filler such as an 
oxide or carbonate of titanium, magnesium or calcium 
to amorphous resins, e.g. polystyrene resins and 
polycarbonate resins, or to crystalline resins, 
e.g. polypropylene and saturated polyester resins. 
However, this method can not satisfactorily deluster the 
surface of molded products. Also well known delustering methods comprise 
adding or grafting a rubber-like elastomer to the 
foregoing resins or using a composition containing a 
crosslinkable ethylene copolymer 
(JP-A- 89346/1984). Yet, these methods 
remain unsatisfactory in delustering effect, and have the 
drawback of giving moldings having irregularly delustered  
 
surface due to uneven dispersion of said filler, 
elastomer or crosslinkable ethylene copolymer. To overcome the foregoing problems of the 
techniques heretofore known, the present inventors 
conducted extensive research
