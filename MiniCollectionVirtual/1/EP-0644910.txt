<DESCRIPTION>
The known resistance of perfluoroelastomers to high 
temperatures and aggressive chemicals makes these materials particularly 
suitable for demanding environments such as aircraft engines and oil drilling 
equipment. Because of the exceptional stability of perfluoroelastomers in 
their cured state, fabricated articles are typically formed from the polymers 
in their uncured state, and then subsequently cured. For example, in the 
fabrication of O-rings, the perfluorinated copolymer, as appropriately 
compounded, is formed into a ring of the required dimensions and 
subsequently cured and post-cured. The stability of such perfluoroelastomers, while providing 
desirable performance characteristics in demanding environments, makes 
further processing difficult. While some techniques have been developed for 
laminating sheets of cured perfluoroelastomer to substrates such as metal, 
satisfactory techniques have heretofore not been available for bonding the 
cured perfluoroelastomer to itself. Such bonding techniques would be useful 
for preparing laminates of two perfluoroelastomers having somewhat 
different characteristics. More importantly, however, such a bonding 
technique would permit the preparation of O-rings from rod stock, rather 
than preparing a separate mold for each size of ring that might be desired. The present invention provides a process for the bonding of 
cured perfluoroelastomers. Specifically, the instant invention provides a process for 
bonding cured perfluoroelastomer to itself, 
the perfluoroelastomer being prepared from tetrafluoroethylene, 
perfluoroalkyl perfluoro(vinyl ether) and at least one non-perfluorinated 
cure site monomer, which process comprises 
(a) coating at least one surface to be joined with a 
thermoplastic perfluoropolymer bonding agent comprising a 
perfluorinated copolymer of a monoethylenically unsaturated 
hydrocarbon in the form of a film, dispersion, or solution, (b) removing substantially all solvent from the bonding 
agent, (c) bringing the surfaces to be joined into contact under 
sufficient pressure to maintain the contact of the surfaces, (d) heating the surfaces to be joined to a temperature above 
the melting point of the perfluoropolymer and below the decomposition -of 
the perfluoroelastomer,  
 (e) cooling the surfaces to be joined to below the melting 
point of the perfluoropolymer, and (f) releasing the pressure from the surfaces to be joined. Perfluoroelastomers which can be used in the present 
invention include those described in
