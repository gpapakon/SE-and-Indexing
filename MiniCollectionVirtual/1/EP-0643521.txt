<ABSTRACT>
Method for building a sub-network (400) for a distributed
Voice Messaging System that can be initiated from any of

the nodes (401-404) in the sub-network. For the distributed
application to work, all the nodes in the network being

created must be identified, numbered, and a map of the
network distributed to all Voice Messaging System nodes.

Advantageously, the inventive method enables logically
independent sub-networks of Voice Messaging Systems to co-exist

in the same physical LAN. An embodiment of the
present invention is a method for building a sub-network

of nodes in a communication network, the method including
the steps of: (a) identifying nodes to be included in the

sub-network; (b) gathering node configuration information
from the nodes identified; (c) resolving node

configuration information conflicts among the nodes in the
sub-network; (d) create a sub-network map; (e)

distributing the sub-network map to the nodes in the sub-network;
and (f) synchronizing the nodes in the sub-network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
building a sub-network in a distributed Voice Messaging
System (VMS) connected by a Local Area Network (LAN) and
dynamically synchronizing all the nodes of the VMS.Distributed Voice Messaging System (VMS)
networks in the art have existed an Local Area Networks
(LANs). However, in such implementations, the entire LAN
has been devoted to the VMS network. This is
inefficient, for example, because it requires a company
to purchase and maintain several LANs in order to provide
connectivity for a computer network as well as for a VMS
network. Further, this approach inhibits possible
connectivity between the two or more types of networks.In light of this, there is a need in the art
for sub-networks of voice messaging systems which
comprises a portion of a communications network such as a
LAN. In addition, there is a need in the art for one or
more of such sub-networks to co-exist an the same
communications network. In further addition, there is a
need in the art for a method for building such sub-networks
of distributed voice messaging systems an a LANFrom US patent US 5,018,133 a method for building
a sub-system in a network system comprising a main LAN and a
plurality of sub-LANs is known. The sub-LANs and the main LAN
are coupled by first bridges, respectively, while the sub-LANs 
are coupled by second bridges, respectively. The sub-system
is comprising the first bridges and the main bridges. Advantageously, embodiments of the present
invention provide a method for building sub-networks of
distributed Voice Messaging Systems (VMSs) on a
communications network such as a Local Area Network
(LAN).For a distributed, sub-network of VMSs to
operate properly, all Voice Messaging (VM) nodes in the
sub-network must be configured with a sub-network map.
The sub-network map is a data structure that contains
information relating to all VM nodes that belong to the
sub-network. The minimum information that must be
contained in the sub-network map (one entry for each node
in the sub-network is included in the sub-network map)
is: (a) a node number for each node in the sub-network (a
node number is a unique identifier for a node in a sub-network);
(b) a group name (a group name is an identifier
of one or more nodes in a LAN network); (c) a Local Area
Network Identifier (a LAN-ID is an identifier of a sub-network);
and (d) a physical address of a LAN Adapter
Card for each node (this is a unique identifier of each
LAN adapter card in the VMS which is read from the
adapter

A method for building a sub-network (100; 120)
of nodes (105, 106, 107, 109; 111, 112) in a communication

identifying nodes (105, 106, 107, 109; 111, 112) to
be included in the sub-network (100; 120) by a user;
sending a broadcast message over the communication
network (200), requesting all identified nodes (105, 106,

107, 109; 111, 112) to respond with their configuration
information;
resolving node configuration information conflicts
among the nodes (105, 106, 107, 109; 111, 112) in the sub-network
