or aqueous/alcoholic solution containing film formers and 

solvents and typical cosmetic components, characterized in 
that 


at least 40% by weight of the preparation consists of 
ethanol, 
the preparation is free from fluorochlorocarbon-containing 
propellants and perfume oils, 
the film former is an anionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic 
polymer or copolymer which contains as 

monomer a completely or partly neutralized ethylenically
