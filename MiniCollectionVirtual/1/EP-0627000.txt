<ABSTRACT>
Mammalian expression systems for the production of HCV proteins. Such expression systems provide high yields of HCV proteins, and enable the development of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents which contain glycosylated structural antigens and also allow for the isolation of the HCV etiological agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and more
particularly, relates to mammalian expression systems capable of generating HCV
proteins and uses of these proteins.Descriptions of Hepatitis diseases causing jaundice and icterus have been
known to man since antiquity. Viral hepatitis is now known to include a group of
viral agents with distinctive viral organization protein structure and mode of
replication, causing hepatitis with different degrees of severity of hepatic damage
through different routes of transmission. Acute viral hepatitis is clinically
diagnosed by well-defined patient symptoms including jaundice, hepatic tenderness
and an elevated level of liver transaminases such as Aspartate Transaminase and
Alanine Transaminase.Serological assays currently are employed to further distinguish between
Hepatitis-A and Hepatitis-B. Non-A Non-B Hepatitis (NANBH) is a term first used
in 1975 that described cases of post-transfusion hepatitis not caused by either
Hepatitis A Virus or Hepatitis B Virus. Feinstone et al., New Engl, J. Med.
292:454-457 (1975). The diagnosis of NANBH has been made primarily by
means of exclusion on the basis of serological analysis for the presence of Hepatitis
A and Hepatitis B. NANBH is responsible for about 90% of the cases of post-transfusion
hepatitis. Hollinger et al. in N. R. Rose et al., eds., Manual of Clinical
Immunology, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C., 558-572
(1986).Attempts to identify the NANBH virus by virtue of genomic similarity to one
of the known hepatitis viruses have failed thus far, suggesting that NANBH has a
distinctive genomic organization and structure. Fowler et al., J. Med. Virol.
12:205-213 (1983), and Weiner et al., J. Med. Virol. 21:239-247 (1987).
Progress in developing assays to detect antibodies specific for NANBH has been
hampered by difficulties encountered in identifying antigens associated with the
virus. Wards et al., U. S. Patent No. 4,870,076; Wards et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. 83:6608-6612 (1986); Ohori et al., J. Med. Virol. 12:161-178 (1983);
Bradly et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84:6277-6281 (1987); Akatsuka et al., J.
Med. Virol. 20:43-56 (1986).In May of 1988, a collaborative effort of Chiron Corporation with the
Centers for Disease Control resulted in the identification of a putative NANB agent,
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). M. Houghton et al. cloned and expressed in E. coli a NANB 
agent obtained from the infectious plasma of a chimp. Cuo et al., Science 244:359-361
(1989); Choo et al.,
