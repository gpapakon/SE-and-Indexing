<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises two pivot hinges (4) which attach the sides of a visor (5) to the side walls of a helmet (1, 2). At least one of the hinges (4) of this device, which comprises two parts (10, 18) which pivot with respect to one another, one (10) of which is fixed to the helmet (1, 2), the other (18) of which is fixed to the visor (5), has a snap-fastening locking mechanism (40, 41) which locks into a particular position corresponding to the pulled-down position of the visor (5), and unlocking means (43, 44, 45) which can be actuated at will in order to release the locking mechanism (40, 41).

Device for the articulated attachment of a visor 
(5) on a helmet (1, 2) including two pivot articulations 

which attach the sides of the visor (5) to the lateral 
walls of the helmet (1, 2), allowing the visor (5) to 

pivot between a position in which it is pulled down in 
front of the eyes of the helmet wearer and a retracted 

position clearing the face of the helmet wearer, at least 
one of which articulations is provided with a mechanism 

(40, 41) for blocking by clicking-in in the pulled-down 
position and with means (43, 44, 45) of unlocking which 

can be actuated at will in order to release the blocking 
mechanism and each of which includes two components (10, 

18), one (10) fixed to the helmet and the other (18) 
fixed to the visor, pivoting one with respect to the 

other about a pivot pin (12) with contacting annular 
surfaces known as bearing surfaces, characterized in that 

the said mechanism of blocking by clicking consists of a 
diametral slot (40) made in one of the bearing surfaces 

(26), known as the female bearing surface and of a 
retractable key (41) the size of the slot (40) slipped 

through the pivot pin (12) and mounted elastically in 
relief on the other bearing surface (16) opposite, known 

as the male bearing surface, of at least one of the 
articulations. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the key (41) travels depthwise along the pivot pin 

(12) in a diametral hole (42) of oblong section pierced 
in the pivot pin (12) which is rotationally integral with 

the male bearing surface (16). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in  
 

that the means of unlocking includes a push-button (44) 
extended at its base by a pull element (43) which enters 

the hollow pivot pin (12) through the pivoting component 
(18) supporting the female bearing surface (26) and which 

keeps the key (41) fixed transversely at its end, and a 
compression spring (45) acting on the push-button (44) so 

as to extract its pull element (43) from the hollow pivot 
pin (12) and bring the key (41) closer to the female 

bearing surface (26). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that its pivot articulations include yank-off shimming 

pieces (17, 19) arranged on the pivot pin (12) on each 
side of the pivoting component (18) fixed to the visor 

(5), the said shimming pieces (17, 19) making it possible, 
by altering their individual thicknesses while 

maintaining their overall thickness, to obtain fine 
transverse adjustment of the position of the visor (5) 

with respect to the helmet (1, 2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the component (18) of its articulations which is 

rotationally integral with the visor (5) is fixed to the 
visor (5) by means of an intermediate lug (27) to which 

it is attached by the bolting of two flat flanges (28, 
29) pierced with oblong holes (30, 31, 32, 33) allowing 

adjustment in a plane perpendicular to the axis of 
pivoting of the articulations (4) of the position of the 

visor (5) with respect to the helmet (1, 2) when the 
visor is pulled down. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pivoting component (18) fixed to the visor (5) 

of at least one of its articulations (4) is surmounted by 
a knob (46) allowing the visor (5) to be manoeuvred 

without having to touch it. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the said knob (46) is in the shape of a shell with 

fluting (50, 51) on its outer face, making it easier to 
grasp. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the said push-button (44) which caps the pivot pin  

 
(12) is housed in a knob (46) which is mounted on the 

pivoting component (18) fixed to the visor (5) and which 
allows the visor to be manoeuvred without having to touch 

it. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it includes elastic means (52) acting between the 

two pivoting components (10, 18) of at least one of its 
articulations (4) so as to return the visor (5) to the 

raised position. 
Device according to Claim 1, with pivot articulations 
(4) exhibiting two components (10, 18) which pivot 

one with respect to the other, one (10) fixed to the 
helmet (1, 2), the other (18) fixed to the visor (5), 

characterized in that it includes elastic means (52) 
acting between the two pivoting components (10, 18) of at 

least one of the articulations (4) so as to return the 
visor (5) to the raised position.
