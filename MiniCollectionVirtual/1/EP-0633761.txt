<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape tab fastener
systems for disposable absorbent articles. More
particularly to tape tab fastener systems combining
mechanical and adhesive tape tab fastener means in a
design with improved handling characteristics, improved
construction stability, compatibility with compression
packaging. In particular it comprises a short release 
tape which is protected against full or partial
detachment from its foundation.The use of tape tab fastener systems for securing
the corners of disposable absorbent articles such as
diapers or incontinents briefs is well known in the art.
Examples of adhesive tape tab fastener systems are
disclosed in US Patent RE 26,151, US Patent 3,848,594
and many other publications. While adhesive tape tab
fastener systems did provide secure means for fixing a
disposable absorbent article around a user's waist
during use they were not totally satisfactory.Adhesive tape tab fastener systems were often only
usable upon initial fixation of the disposable absorbent
article while refastening was not possible. They also
displayed unsatisfactory resistance against
contamination.Hence the prior art discloses many alternative
fastener systems trying to solve these problems. For
example mechanical fastener systems of the hook/loop
type (random entanglement) have been contemplated and
disclosed in many publications. In general mechanical
fastener systems have the advantage of reduced or no
sensitivity versus contamination for example by oils or
powders. Mechanical hook/loop fastener systems also
have the advantage of being reclosable after opening for
example to check the soiling of absorbent articles or to
correct the fitting of absorbent articles on the wearer.
However, mechanical fasteners require a two part
fastening system e.g. tape tabs with hooks and a landing
surface with loops. Mechanical tape tab fasteners of the hook/loop type
have been disclosed for use in diapers for example in US
Patent 3,110,312 and for disposable diapers in US Patent
4,259,957 or European Patent Application EP-A-235014.After establishing the principal advantages of
mechanical fasteners over adhesive tape tab fasteners,
it was found that mechanical fasteners lack the ease of
disposability which the adhesive tape tab fasteners
provided for disposable absorbent articles. Before
disposing a used disposable absorbent article the
article is often rolled up upon itself. This pack is
then closed by applying the adhesive tape tab onto the
outside surface of the rolled up disposable

<CLAIMS>
A disposable absorbent article (20) having a transport
configuration when packaged and during transport, said

absorbent article comprising:

a body portion (22) having an inside surface (44)
and an outside surface (46), having longitudinal side

edges (40) in longitudinal direction, a first and a

second lateral end edge (42) in lateral direction and
a first end region (48) and a second end region (50) in

said longitudinal direction;
an adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60),
having a manufacturer's region (74) and a user's region

(75); said tape tab (60) being disposed in said lateral
first end region (48) such that said manufacturer's

region (74) is joined to said absorbent article (20)
and said user's region (75) extends beyond said

longitudinal side edge (40) of said absorbent article
(20); said user's region (75) having a proximal region

to said longitudinal side edge (40) and a distal region
to said longitudinal side edge (40); said proximal

region comprising an adhesive fastening member (63) and
said distal region comprising a mechanical fastening

member (62); said adhesive fastening member (63) and
said mechanical fastening member (62) each having their

fastening surface oriented in the direction of said
inside surface (44); said user's region (75) being

folded onto said inside surface (44) in said transport
configuration;
a mechanical fastening landing member (64) for
cooperation with said mechanical fastening member (62)

of said adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60),
said landing member (64) being disposed in said

lateral second end region (50) and joined to said
outside surface (46) of said absorbent article (20); 
a release tape (65)
having a laterally inward edge (66) and

being disposed on said inside
surface (44)for cooperation with said adhesive

fastening member (63) of said user's region (75) in
said transport configuration; said release tape (65)

not extending into said fastening surface of said
mechanical fastening member (62) in said transport

configuration; and

characterised in that said disposable absorbent article (20) further
comprises:
a delamination introducing area (67) providing a
non-adhesive surface and being disposed between the

fastening surfaces of said adhesive fastening member
(63) and said mechanical fastening member (62) on said

adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60), said
delamination introducing area in said

transport configuration extending over the lateral inward edge
(66) of said release tape (65).
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to claim 1
wherein said delamination introducing area (67) extends

from 3 mm to 10 mm, preferably from 5 mm to 7 mm, in
lateral direction from said lateral inward edge (66) of

said release tape (65) over said release tape (65) in said
transport configuration.
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said mechanical fastening

member (62) comprises a base material and protruding
mechanical elements such that said base material provides

said non-adhesive surface of said delamination
introducing area (67).
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said release tape (65)

extends over said longitudinal side edge (40) of said
absorbent article (20) and is joined to said adhesive

fastening member (63) to form a Y-bond (70). 
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said release tape (65) is

joined to said inside surface (44) of said absorbent
article (20) by an adhesive.
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said user's region (75) and

said manufacturer's region (74) of said adhesive-mechanical
fastening tape tab (60) are continuous and

have a continuous adhesive layer, said manufacturer's
region (74) being secured to said outside surface (46) of

said absorbent article (20) by said continuous adhesive
layer.
A disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of
the preceding claims wherein said mechanical fastening

member (62) comprises hook-type engaging means and the
mechanical fastening landing member (64) comprises loop-type

engaging means to engage with said hook-type
engaging means during use of said absorbent article (20).
