<ABSTRACT>
Microprocessor safety system, applicable in particular to the field of railway transportation, for monitoring and controlling actuators (ACT) as a function of the data provided by sensors (CP), characterised in that it comprises at least two paralleled microprocessors (P1, P2) handling the same application, the inputs of which receive the, previously coded, data (DE) from the sensors (CP) and whose output data are reread in safety so as to be compared with the input data, and a third, comparison, microprocessor (P3) called a poller, for comparing, through software and in safety, the coded characteristic results (R1, R2) from the two application microprocessors (P1, P2) and controlling accordingly a dynamic monitor (CD) authorising the sending of the output data (DS) to the actuators (ACT).

<CLAIMS>
Microprocessor based safety system, applicable, in particular, to the field of rail
transport, for monitoring and controlling actuators (ACT) as a function of the data

supplied by sensors (CP), comprising at least two microprocessors (P1, P2) in parallel
handling the same application, the inputs of which receive the data (DE) from the

sensors (CP) and a third comparison microprocessor (P3) known as a voter, for
comparing results (R1, R2) of the two application microprocessors (P1, P2) and

operating accordingly a dynamic controller (CD) authorizing the transmission of the
output data (DS) to the actuators (ACT), characterized in that the inputs and outputs of

both application microprocessors (P1, P2) are encoded according to the encoded
processor technique, in that the voter (P3) performs, using software and in safety, the

comparison of the encoded characteristic results (R1, R2) of the two application
microprocessors (P1, P2) using the encoded processor technique, and in that the output

data (DS) is read back in safety for comparison with the input data (DE).
Safety system according to claim 1, characterized in that a time lag is
introduced between the two application microprocessors (P1, P2).
Safety system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it comprises a
single, non-dedicated bus (B) via which the information transits between the different

microprocessors (P1, P2, P3).
Safety system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
voter (P3) comprises an algorithm making it possible, in addition to comparing the

results (R1, R2) of the two application microprocessors (P1, P2), to carry out filtering
and consistency checks on the different outputs.
Safety system according to claim 4, characterized in that the algorithm of the
voter (P3) makes it possible to achieve partial inhibition of the outputs in the event of

discrepancies between certain results only.
Safety system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it
comprises more than two application processors (P1, P2), the voter (P3) providing

majority logic for n out of p processors.
Safety system according to claim 6, characterized in that the voter's software
is installed in any one of the application processors.
