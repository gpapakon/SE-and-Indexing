<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a travelling mechanism (running gear) (1) for an extension arm (5) of a gondola (6), which is supported displaceably on a guide rail (4) by means of rollers (36, 37), the travelling mechanism (1) comprises a travelling-mechanism support (21) for the extension arm (5) and two or more U-shaped brackets (31) which engage over the guide rail (4). Furthermore, the brackets (31) are connected rotatably to the travelling-mechanism support (21) and are provided with the rollers (36, 37). By means of this configuration, it is possible to lay the guide rail (4) directly on the roof surface (3) of a building (2), and the guide rail (4) may also be arranged in an arcuate manner. By virtue of the articulated connection of the brackets (31) to the travelling-mechanism support (21), the travelling mechanism (1) can, in fact, turn curves without any lateral displacement movements of the rollers (36, 37) taking place.

<CLAIMS>
Driving carriage (1) for a jib (5) of a gondola (6) or a similar holding or 
working apparatus, a crane or similar, which is supported using track 

rollers (36, 37) and can be moved along at least one guide rail (4), 
comprising a beam-shaped driving carriage carrier (21) to which one or 

more jibs (5) are attached, and further comprising two or more U or L-shaped 
frames (31) overreaching the guide rail (4), in which each of the 

frames (31) can be rotated, are connected to the driving carriage carrier 
(21) and are provided with the track rollers (36, 37),
characterised in that,
 
the driving carriage (1) is supported by the track rollers (36, 37) on a 

single guide rail (4) common to all frames (31) and that guide rollers (40, 
41) spaced at lateral intervals from one another are attached to the 

frames (31) on one side of the guide rail (4), preferably on the side facing 
the jib (5), whilst guide rollers (42) which act in conjunction with the guide 

rail (4) are attached on the opposite side and positioned centrally in 
relation to the frames (31).  

 
The driving carriage in accordance with claim 1,
characterised in that,
 
each of the frames (31) are rotatably mounted on an articulated pin (35) 

provided on their top sides with a vertical clearance, with the mounting 
preferably being effected by means of anti-friction bearings (24) in a bore 

(23) in the driving carriage carrier (21). 
The driving carriage in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that,
 
the guide rail (4) is formed as a rail (11, 11') with a double-T or U-shaped 

cross-section, and that the track rollers (36, 37) attached to the frames 
(31) engage between and are thereby guided by the vertical legs (13, 14, 

13', 14') of the guide rail (4). 
The driving carriage in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,
 
the frames (31) are provided with guide rollers (40, 41, 42) which make 

contact with the ends of the legs (13, 14) of the guide rail (4). 
The driving carriage in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
,
 
in a jib (5') attached to a driving carriage carrier (21), the jib (5') is 

supported by and can be moved along a support rail (15) running parallel 
to the guide rail (4) by means of one or more support rollers (17).  

 
The driving carriage in accordance with one or more of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that,
 
one of the legs (33') of the frames (31'), preferably the leg (33') facing the 

jib (5), is provided with an extension (45) at the extremity of which one or 
more support rollers (46) are attached, with the support rollers (46) 

making contact with a support rail (19) arranged in parallel to the guide 
rail (4).
