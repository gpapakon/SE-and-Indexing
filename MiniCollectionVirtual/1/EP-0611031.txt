<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an aqueous process for preparing water-soluble 
addition copolymers of containing, as polymerized units: (a) from about 3 to about 95 percent 

by weight of one or more cyclohexene anhydrides or the alkali metal or ammonium salts 
thereof, and (b) from about 5 to about 97 percent by weight of one or more monomers C₄-C₆ 

monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and the alkali metal and ammonium salts 
thereof. These copolymers are useful as water-treatment additives for boiler waters and 

cooling towers and as detergent additives acting as builders, anti-filming agents, dispersants, 
sequestering agents and encrustation inhibitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous process for preparing water-soluble addition 
co-polymers of cyclohexene dicarboxylic acid anhydrides (hereinafter "cyclohexene 
anhydrides"). In particular, this invention relates to an aqueous process for preparing 
water-soluble addition copolymers of cyclohexene anhydrides with one or more 
monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid monomers. Cyclohexene anhydrides are monoethylenically unsaturated six-membered rings 
with anhydride functionality attached to the ring. For example, 1,2,3,6-cis-tetrahydrophthalic 
anhydride is a cydohexene anhydride with the following structure: 
 
Cyclohexene anhydrides are commonly prepared by Diels-Alder processes. For example, 
1,2,3,6-cis-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride can be prepared by a Diels-Alder reaction 
between butadiene and maleic anhydride. 5-norbomene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid anhydride 
can be prepared from maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene. Other cyclohexene 
anhydrides can be made by using substituted analogues of either the diene or anhydride. Cyclohexene anhydrides can be used as a monomer in either of two ways: 1) to 
produce condensation polymers by reacting the carboxyl groups of the cyclohexene 
anhydrides with reactive moieties such as hydroxyls to form polyesters, or 2) to produce 
addition polymers by free-radical polymerization at the site of ethylenic unsaturation. Water-soluble addition polymers and copolymers are useful as water-treatment 
additives for boiler waters and cooling towers and as detergent and cleaner additives 
acting as builders, anti-filming agents, dispersants, sequestering agents and encrustation 
inhibitors. Addition copolymers have been prepared by reacting equimolar amounts of maleic 
anhydride and tetrahydrophthalic anhydride by processes using molten reactants as the 
reaction medium, or by processes employing organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, 
toluene and diethyl benzene. Addition copolymers of maleic anhydride and endo-cis-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic 
anhydride have been prepared by processes employing no 
solvent, or employing inert organic solvents. The present invention seeks to provide an aqueous process for preparing water-soluble 
addition copolymers or cyclohexene anhydrides. According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing water-soluble 
polymers comprising: polymerizing a monomer mixture in water, and 
substantially free of organic solvents, and in the presence of one or more polymerization 
initiators at a temperature of
