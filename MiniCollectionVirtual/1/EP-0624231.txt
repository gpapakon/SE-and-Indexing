<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new belt tensioner 
for a belt tensioning system. It is known by US-A-4 886 483 to Henderson to provide a belt tensioner for a belt tensioning 
system comprising a support means having an 
abutment means, an endless transmission belt 
construction carried by the support means and 
arranged to move in a certain path relative to the 
support means, an arm pivotally mounted to the 
support means, a pulley rotatably carried by the 
arm and being in engagement with the belt 
construction, and a wound coiled spring having 
opposed ends one of which is operatively 
interconnected to the abutment means of the support 
means and the other of which is operatively 
interconnected to the arm whereby the force of the 
wound coiled spring tends to pivot the arm in a 
direction that urges the pulley against the belt 
construction with a force that tensions the belt 
construction. It is one of the features of this 
invention to provide a new belt tensioner for a belt tensioning system 
wherein the belt tensioner comprises an arm and a 
wound coiled spring that can be carried by the arm 
so as to provide a self-contained unit and which 
when assembled to the support means of the system 
provides a means to transfer one end of the spring  
 
to an abutment means on the support means so that 
that end of the spring will be operatively 
interconnected to the support means and permit the 
force of the spring to provide a tensioning force 
on an endless transmission belt construction that 
is carried by the support means to move in an 
endless path thereon. In particular, it was found according to 
the teachings of this invention that the arm of the 
belt tensioner can be provided with a shoulder 
means against which the one end of the wound coiled 
spring can engage so as to permit the arm and 
spring to be a self-contained unit to be inserted 
in the belt tensioning system and to be removed 
therefrom and when assembled to the support means 
can transfer the engagement of that one end of the 
spring from the shoulder means of the arm to an 
abutment means on the support means to effectively 
interconnect that one end to the support means 
whereby the force of the spring tends to pivot the 
arm in a direction to apply a tensioning force to a 
belt construction that is engaged by a pulley 
rotatably carried by the arm. For example, one embodiment of this 
invention comprises a belt tensioner for a belt tensioning system 
comprising a support means having an abutment 
means, an endless transmission

<CLAIMS>
A belt tensioner for a belt 
tensioning system (20) that comprises a support 

means (21) having an abutment means (46) and an 
endless transmission belt construction (22) carried 

by said support means (21) and arranged to move in 
a certain path relative to said support means, said 

tensioner (23) comprising an arm (24) adapted to be 
pivotally mounted to said support means (21), a 

pulley (25) rotatably carried by said arm (24) and 
being adapted to be in engagement with said belt 

construction (22), and a wound coiled spring (29) 
having opposed ends (30, 31), one (30) of which is 

adapted to be operatively interconnected to said 
abutment means (46) of said support means (21) and 

the other (31) of which is operatively 
interconnected to said arm (24) whereby the force 

of said wound coiled spring (29) is adapted to 
pivot said arm (24) in a direction that urges said 

pulley (25) against said belt construction (22) 
with a force that tensions said belt construction, 

characterized in that said arm (24) 
has a shoulder means (62) that is engaged by said 

one (30) of said opposed ends (30, 31) of said 
wound coiled spring (29) by the force of said wound  

 
coiled spring so as to permit insertion and removal 

of said arm (24) and said wound coiled spring (29) 
as a self-contained unit to and from said support 

means (21) when said arm (24) is pivoted to a 
certain position where said shoulder means (62) of 

said arm engages said one end (30) of said wound 
coiled spring (29) and effectively holds said one 

end of said wound coiled spring out of contact with 
said abutment means (46) of said support means 

(21). 
A belt tensioner as set forth in 
claim 1, characterized in that said wound coiled 

spring (29) comprises a substantially flat wire 
helical spring wherein said opposed ends (30, 31) 

thereof comprise an inner end (30) and an outer end 
(31). 
A belt tensioner as set forth in 
claim 2, characterized in that said one end (30) 

of said wound coiled spring (29) comprises said 
inner end thereof. 
A belt tensioner as set forth in 
claim 1, characterized in that said arm (24) has 

surface means (48) adapted to be disposed for 
movement relative to a cylindrical hub (36) of said 

support means (21). 
A belt tensioner as set forth in 
claim 1, characterized by a fastening member (40) 

rotatably carried by said arm (24) and adapted to 
be disposed into an opening (38) of said support 

means (21) so as to fasten said arm (24) to said 
support means. 
A belt tensioner as set forth in 
claim 5, characterized in that said arm (24) is 

rotatably disposed on said fastening member (40). 
A belt tensioner as set  
 

forth in claim 6, characterized in that a bushing 
(77) is disposed between said fastening member (40) 

and said arm (24) to facilitate rotational movement 
therebetween. 
A belt tensioner as set forth in 
claim 7, characterized in that said bushing (77) 

has an annular flange (78) engaging said arm (24), 
said fastening member (40) having an enlarged head 

(81) for compacting said annular flange (78) 
against said arm (24).  

 
A belt tensioner as set 
forth in claim 1, characterized in that said 

support means (21) has a pair of spaced apart stop 
means (51, 53; 52, 54) respectively engageable by 

said arm (24) to limit pivotal movement of said arm 
in each pivoting direction of movement thereof. 
A belt tensioner as set 
forth in claim 9, characterized in that said arm 

(24) is disposed closely adjacent one (52, 54) of 
said stop means when said arm is in said certain 

position thereof.
