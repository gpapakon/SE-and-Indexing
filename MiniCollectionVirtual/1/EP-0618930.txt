 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY TO HIV-2 AND USES THEREOFBackground of the Invention This invention relates generally to monoclonal antibodies, and more particularly, relates to a murine monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to HIV-2 and does not significantly bind to HTV-l, uses for the monoclonal antibody, and kits which contain the monoclonal antibody.Present epidemiological data suggest that the AcquiredImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by at least two types of human immunodeficiency viruses, collectively designated as HIV. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been isolated from patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC), and from healthy persons at high risk for AIDS. See, for example, F. Barre-Sinoussi et al., Isolation of T-Lymphotropic Retrovirus From a Patient At Risk For Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Science 220:868-871 (1983); M. Popovic et al, Detection, Isolation and Continuous Production Of Cytopathic Retroviruses (HTLV-m) From Patients With AIDS and Pre-AIDS, Science 224:497-500 (1984); and R. C. Gallo et al., Frequent Detection and Isolation Of CytopathicRetroviruses (HTLV-III) From Patients With AIDS and At Risk For AIDS, Science 224:500-503 (1984).HIV-1 reportedly is transmitted by sexual contact, exposure to blood or certain blood products, or from an infected mother to her fetus or child. P. Piot et al., AIDS: An International Perspective, Science 239:573-579 (1988). Also, the incidence of HTV-l antibodies is high in AIDS and ARC patients and persons at risk. M.G. Sarngadharan et al, Antibodies Reactive With Human 

 T-Lymphotrophic Retroviruses (HTLV-DI) In The Serum of Patients With AIDS, Science 224:506-508 (1984). This virus can be isolated from nearly 90% of all seropositive individuals. D. Gallo et al., Comparative Studies On Use Of Fresh and Frozen Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Specimens For Isolation Of Human 3-mmunodeficiency Virus and Effects Of Cell Lysis On Isolation Efficiency, T. Clin. Microbiology 25:1291-1294 (1987).A second HTV virus, designated as Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 (HIV-2), was isolated from patients with AIDS in West Africa in 1986. F. Clavel et al., Isolation Of a New Human Retrovirus From West African Patients With AIDS, Science 233:343-346 (1996). HTV-2 infections now have been identified in humans outside of the initial endemic area, and have been reported in Europeans who have lived in West Africa or those who have had sexual relations with individuals from this region, homosexuals with sexual partners from

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A monoclonal antibody that spedfically binds to HTV-2 gp36 antigen and does not bind to HTV-l antigens.
2. The monoclonal antibody of daim 1 which is secreted by the cell line A.T.C.C. Deposit No. HB 10908.
3. A hybridoma cell line which secretes a monoclonal antibody whidi spedfically binds to HTV-2 gp36 antigen and does not spedfically bind to HTV-l antigens.
4. The hybridoma cell line of claim 3 wherein the cell line is A.T.C.C. Deposit No. HB 10908.
5. In an immunoassay for HTV-2 antigen or antibody, the improvement comprising the step of: adding a known amount of a monodonal antibody which specifically binds to HTV-2 gp36 antigen and which does not significantly bind to HTV-l antigens.
6. The immunoassay of claim 1 wherein the monoclonal antibody is secreted by cell line A.T.C.C. Deposit No. HB 10908.
7. A test kit to determine the presence of at least HTV-2 in a test sample, comprising: a container containing an aliqout of the monoclonal antibody secreted by A.T.C.C. deposit N. HB 10908.
