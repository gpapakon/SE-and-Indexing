<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus and 
method for performing polarization-insensitive four-photon 

mixing of optical signals. The polarization-insensitive 
optical mixer (40) includes a polarization splitter (44) for 

splitting an optical signal (42) into parallel and 
perpendicular polarization components, different mixing 

paths (45,46) for mixing a pump signal of like polarization with 
each of the parallel and perpendicular components in a 

nonlinear mixing device (51,52), and a polarization combiner (59) for 
combining the resulting mixing products. Certain of the 

mixing products represent phase conjugates of the input 
optical signal, and are therefore useful in compensating 

for chromatic dispersion in optical fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
improvements in optical communication systems. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to techniques 
for phase conjugating and/or frequency converting optical 
signals in an optical communication system using four-photon 
mixing. Optical communication typically involves transmitting 
high bit rate digital data over silica glass fiber by 
modulating a laser or other optical signal source. 
Although glass fiber has a very broad bandwidth, on the 
order of 40,000 THz, the maximum data rate which can be 
transmitted across a given length of fiber is limited by 
chromatic dispersion and nonlinearities within the fiber. 
Dispersion and nonlinearities spread an optical signal in 
time and frequency, respectively, as it propagates through 
the fiber. Chromatic dispersion, often simply called 
dispersion, refers to a phenomenon in which the speed of 
an optical signal through the fiber varies as a function 
of the optical signal frequency or wavelength. Chromatic 
dispersion is generally considered linear to the first 
order as a function of wavelength, and second order 
dispersion is therefore approximated to be zero. 
Nonlinearities, on the other hand, involve changes in the 
propagation speed of an optical signal as a function of 
the signal amplitude or intensity. One commonly 
encountered nonlinearity is the Kerr effect, in which the 
fiber index of refraction increases with increasing 
optical signal amplitude. For systems transmitting at a  
 
given data rate, these dispersion and nonlinear effects 
limit the achievable non-regenerated transmission 
distance. As a result, for long-haul optical communication 
links, it is necessary to either control, compensate or 
suppress dispersion and nonlinearity, or use regenerative 
repeaters along the fiber transmission path. One of the known techniques for compensating first 
order chromatic dispersion effects in fiber uses midsystem 
optical phase conjugation to balance the first order 
dispersion occurring in the first half of a fiber 
transmission span with that occurring in the second half 
of the span. Because phase conjugating a given signal 
reverses its phase, mid-span conjugation allows the 
effects of first order dispersion in each half of the span 
to cancel out. See A. Yariv, D. Fekete and D. Pepper, 
"Compensation for channel dispersion by nonlinear optical 
phase conjugation", Optics Letters, vol.4, pp. 52-54, 
1979. By counteracting first order linear dispersive 
effects in this manner,
