<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat exchanger, in particular for a refrigerator, having a housing and at least one fan for blowing out the air flowing through the heat exchanger through an outlet orifice of the housing. In order to avoid energy losses during a defrosting operation and to save energy costs, there is fitted, on the outside of the outlet orifice (4) of the housing (1), a flexible piece of sheet-like material (6, 15) which, when the fan is running, permits the cooled air to blow out unhindered into the surrounding room, but which collapses when the fan is switched off and thus covers the outlet orifice of the housing, so that it is not possible, during the defrosting process, for humid, warm defrosting air to flow out into the environment through the outlet orifice of the housing.

Apparatus, especially cooling apparatus, comprising a 
housing (1) and at least one heat exchanger (2) and one 

fan (5) for blowing the air passing through the heat exchanger 
(2) out through an outlet of the housing (1)
characterized in that
 
at the outlet (4) of the housing (1) at least one 

flexible surface piece (6,15,19) is mounted, which is 
oriented by the dynamic pressure, when the fan (5) is in 

operation, in direction of the airflow and thus makes the 
air escape into the surrounding region, whereas it collapses, 

when the fan is not in operation, and covers the 
outlet. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
an essentially rectangular flexible surface piece (15) is 

fastened with one edge on the outlet (4), wherein the 
measurements of the surface piece (15) 

correspond at least to those of the outlet (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the free edge of the surface piece (15) is provided with 

a flexible means (16) for tightening the surface piece in 
case of escaping airflow. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
a plurality of stripes (19) of a flexible surface piece 

are disposed distributed over the outlet (4) such that 
they cover the outlet, when the fan is not in operation.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the flexible surface piece is formed as a sleeve piece 

(6) which is applied around the circumference of the outlet 
(4). 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
if a plurality of fans (5) are disposed beside each 

other, one flexible surface piece (6, 15) is allocated 
to each fan. 
Apparatus according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
the sleeve piece (6) has in the inflated state a 

form tapered toward the air outlet side. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
on the air inlet side (3) of the hou
sing (1) a rigid dome 
(7) is formed which is open on the bottom and covers the 

air inlet side on the top and on the sides. 
Apparatus according to claim 8,
 
characterized in that
 
if a plurality of fans are disposed beside each other, 

the dome (7) is provided with separations between the 
particular suction regions. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
on the air inlet side (3) of the housing (1) on top of 

each other stripes (18) made of flexible material are 
disposed, which cover the air inlet side, when the fan is 

not in operation, and are oriented in direction of the 
air flow, when the fan (5) is in operation.
