<CLAIMS>
Method for producing a thermal protection device 
for fixing on a circuit substrate in the form of a spring 

clip (1) which has two contact points (5, 6), at least 
one of which is a solder point, for connection to corresponding 

circuit contacts on the substrate, as well as at 
least one elastic spring arm (2, 3) as a connecting 

section between the two contact points (5, 6), 
characterized in that the spring clip (1) is located with 

its solder points (5, 6) in a stress-free manner on the 
solder contacts (15, 16) of the circuit substrate and is 

soldered, and in that a prestress, which is directed at 
a change in the distance between the solder points, is 

then produced by deforming a bent section (4) in the 
spring clip (1). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an M-shaped bent section (4) is deformed by applying 

force on both sides transversely with respect to the 
spring limbs (2, 3) (Figure 3). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an M-shaped bent section (4) is deformed plastically 

by applying force to the centre part approximately 

parallel to the spring limbs (2, 3).
