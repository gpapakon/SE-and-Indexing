<ABSTRACT>
The scanning device comprises a first section (16) which can be 
secured 

to a slide, a second section (6) which is movable relative to said 
first section and which 

includes a lens (2), and actuator means for moving the lens in a 
focusing direction (F). 

In order to enable short access times to be obtained the device has 
mechanical limiting 

means (34,35) for limiting movements of the movable section in a radial 
direction. These means 

are constructed to allow the movable section to perform unimpeded 
movements in the 

focusing direction during limiting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a scanning device as defined in the preamble of
Claim 1.Such a device is known from EP-A 0 458 027. This document discloses a
CD player having a movable pickup head with a projection extending between two
stationary and stiff stoppers. When an operation for searching is carried out a solenoid
is energized for shifting the pickup head in a direction torwards one of the stoppers,
whereby the projection is abutted against the relevant stopper, whereafter the pickup
head is held at the position where the projection engages the stopper.An electro-optical scanning device is further used in an apparatus known
from EP-A 0,464,912. This known scanning device has an objective lens which is
movable in a focusing direction, in order to form a radiation spot on a surface to be
scanned, and in a tracking direction transverse to the focusing direction, in order to
follow a recording track. For this purpose the scanning device comprises a stationary
section having a magnetic circuit with an air gap, a section which is movable relative to
the stationary section and carries said lens, and coils for driving the movable section
with the lens. The movable section is secured to the stationary section by flexible
mechanical suspension means.The known electro-optical scanning device is used in an optical player,
which also comprises a turntable and a slide. The slide, which carries the scanning
device, is movable relative to the turntable along a radial path, which radial path
extends in said tracking direction.Such a player is suitable inter alia for reading disc-shaped optical
information carriers carrying information in a plurality of concentric tracks or quasi-concentric
tracks together forming a spiral information track. When the information
carrier is rotated by means of the turntable it is possible to scan a single track in the
information carrier. To scan the other tracks the objective lens should be moved over
the tracks in a radial direction. A short access time to the stored information requires a
rapid movement of the objective lens over the tracks. This can be achieved by a jump-like 
movement of the slide over a radial distance. Since this may be attended with
substantial accelerations and decelerations the movable section of the scanning device
may be pressed against the stationary section. This obstructs movements of the objective
lens in the focusing direction during rapid movement of the slide, which may give rise
to errors in the track count during a search function.It is an object
