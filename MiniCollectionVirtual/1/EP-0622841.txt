<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for transportation of wafers from one stage to another in a manufacturing process while protecting 
clean silicon surfaces and thin films on them from contamination through the air. The apparatus includes a wafer container 

(101) having a gas inlet (103) and a gas outlet (112), an inert gas container (103) having an inert gas sealed therein, and a piping 
(114) for connecting the gas inlet (113) of the wafer container to the inert gas container (103) and for sending the inert gas in the 

inert gas container to the wafer container (114), and wafers are transported while the inside of the wafer container is constantly 
purged by introducing the inert gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a highly clean 
material transportation apparatus and a material 
transportation method for transporting materials in a 
highly clean atmosphere, and in particular relates to a 
highly clean material transportation apparatus and a 
material transportation method which is capable of 
protecting substrates from impurities in the air and is 
capable of maintaining a constant highly clean state of the 
substrate surfaces, during the transportation of substrates 
in semiconductor manufacturing processes and the like. In accordance with recent progress in LSI 
microprocessing technologies and cleaning technologies, 
concern has grown over adhering impurities and natural 
oxide films present on silicon surfaces, and the complete 
control of silicon surfaces is of increasing importance in 
view of the establishment of processes having higher 
performance. For example, in order to control selective reactions 
such as etching or film formation or the like with high 
precision, or to realize ideal boundaries between different 
materials, it is most important that the deposition of  
 
impurities on silicon surfaces and the formation of natural 
oxide films be suppressed, and that ultra-clean silicon 
surfaces be obtained. In order to completely suppress such 
depositing of impurities or formation of natural oxide 
films, and in order to obtain ultra-clean silicon surfaces, 
it is necessary that the deposition of impurities on the 
wafer surface be completely prevented during the period of, 
for example, the completion of the final washing process of 
the silicon wafers to the positioning of the wafers within 
the ultra-clean processing apparatus of the subsequent 
process, or while the wafers are being moved among 
processing apparatuses. Conventionally, in order to obtain ideal silicon 
surfaces, energetic attempts have been made to improve the 
purity of the chemicals, pure water, or the like employed 
during wet washing. As a result, it has become possible to 
obtain surfaces on which the presence of impurities or 
natural oxide films is reduced in the extreme during wet 
washing; however, as silicon surfaces are extremely active, 
during subsequent transport to the processing apparatuses 
of following processes, problems occurred in that the 
wafers came into contact with the air and surfaces which 
had been rendered clean were again contaminated, and 
natural oxide films formed thereon. Furthermore, in order to obtain ideal boundaries 
between differing materials, as well, the
