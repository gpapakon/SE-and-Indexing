<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a succession of self-adhesive 
labels on a length of release material, which method comprises 

the steps of:- 

(a) applying a layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive to 
a surface of a length of release material (2); 
(b) applying a succession of individual folded sheets (10) 
to the layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive so as to adhere 

the folded sheets to the release material, each folded sheet 
having an upper panel and a lower panel; 
(c) applying to the succession of folded sheets on the 
release material a web (14) of a self-adhesive laminar material 

whereby the laminar material is adhered by the self-adhesive 
surface thereof over the succession of folded sheets; 
(d) cutting (17) through the laminar material, the folded 
sheets and the pressure-sensitive adhesive as far as the 

release material thereby to form the self-adhesive labels, the 
cutting step being carried out whereby the upper panel of the 

folded sheet with the laminar material adhered thereto can be 
pulled away from the lower panel thereby to open the label; and 
(e) removing from the release material waste portions 
of the laminar material, of the folded sheets and of the 

pressure-sensitive adhesive which surround the self-adhesive 
labels. The invention also relates to self-adhesive labels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
labels and in particular to a method of producing a succession
of self-adhesive labels on a length of release material. The
present invention also relates to a self-adhesive label.In the packaging field there is a great demand for high
quality pre-printed labels for labelling containers of various
types. In order to facilitate the packaging and labelling of
containers at a fast rate it is generally required that the
labels to be attached to the containers be made available in a
form in which they are easy to handle and easy to transfer onto
the containers for which they are intended. In one convenient
arrangement the labels are self-adhesive labels which are carried
in a series on a web of release material which is wound into a
reel. The Applicant's earlier GB-A-2199010 discloses a method
and apparatus for producing labels in which self-adhesive labels
are carried directly on a release material.EP-A-0192444 discloses a self-adhesive label having the
features of the pre-characterising portions of claims 1 and 10.It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved
method of producing labels which is a development of the
Applicant's earlier method.Accordingly the present invention provides a self-adhesive
label comprising a self-adhesive support web carried on a backing
of release material, a folded sheet disposed on the support web,
the folded sheet including an upper panel having a folded edge
at which the upper panel is connected to a lower panel of the
sheet and an opposite free outer edge, the folded edge being
disposed over the support web, and a self-adhesive laminar
material which covers the upper panel and extends past the folded
edge to form an end portion thereof which is adhered to the
support web characterised by the free outer edge extending past
the support web and over the backing of release material, and the
free outer edge being releasably held adjacent the release 
material thereby to retain the sheet in its folded configuration.The present invention also provides a method of producing
a succession of self-adhesive labels on a length of release
material which method comprises the steps of:- (a) providing a
succession of self-adhesive support webs carried on a length of
release material; (b) applying a succession of folded sheets to
the succession of support webs, each folded sheet comprising an
upper panel connected to a lower panel by a folded edge, each
sheet being applied whereby the folded edge is disposed over the
suppor
