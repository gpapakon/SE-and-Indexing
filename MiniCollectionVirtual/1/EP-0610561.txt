<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling an electrolytic 
silver recovery system (11) for a photographic processor, the control 

being effected in response to the surface area of the photosensitive material 
(8, 9, 10) moved through the processing solutions. By means of the 

apparatus (3) the amount of silver deposited in the fixing bath (9) of the 
processor is determined from the width, length and density of the photosensitive 

material and used as an electrical signal for controlling the electrolytic 

current of the silver recovery system (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for controlling an electrolytic
silver recovery system for a photographic processor, the control
being effected in response to the surface area of the photosensitive material
moved through the processing solutions.Methods of this type in which a signal is gained from the processor which
is proportional to the processed film or paper area and, thus, also proportional
to the amount of silver deposited in the fixing bath of the processor,
are known. In DE-PS 1 188 822, for example, a method is described
for electrolytically recovering silver in which recovery is controlled by
turning on and off the electrolytic current in response to the amount of
photographic material moved through the fixing bath. The surface area of
the material to be processed is the basic parameter therefor, assuming
that on average always identical amounts of silver are dissolved from the
material.In DE-PS 1 237 789 the operating cycle of the silver recovery system is
determined by a pulse generator activated by the film material moved
through the processor, with the possibility of storing the pulses. In this
case as well, the surface area of the material to be processed is the decisive
factor and, as a result, only an average amount of silver to be
recovered from the photosensitive material is used as a basic parameter.An improved method for detecting the area of the photosensitive material is described
by the US 4,506,969. A film processor includes a scanner which measures the
transmittance of light through the film material along a line with respect to the
direction of film travel. Thus, the film width can be determined whereas the film length
is determined by the transport speed of the film.US 4,341,453 discloses an automatic control system for a photographic processor. For
detecting the width of an unprocessed film, an array of reflective infrared sensors is
used which are positioned across a path of the film.The disadvantage of such methods is that the amount of silver in the fixing
bath is averaged and used as a basic parameter by means of which
the electrolytic silver recovery system is controlled.  On the other hand, silver recovery systems are known that operate in
response to the silver content of the fixing solution forming an electronic
reference value. The reference value may be, for example, the cathode
potential of a reference electrode that is proportional to the silver concentration.
There is a disadvantage, however, in that a continuity of the
value determined by the silver content

<CLAIMS>
Method of controlling an electrolytic silver recovery system for a photographic
processor, the control being effected in response to the surface area of the

photosensitive material which is moved through the processing solutions by
measuring its widths, length and density, characterized by the steps of:


a) measuring the width and length of the photosensitive material by means of an
IR reflective light-operated sensor arrangement (1, 1');
b) measuring the density of the photosensitive material by means of an IR
transmitted light-operated sensor arrangement (2, 2'), whereby both sensor

arrangements are arranged in rows and alternately across
the width of the path of said photosensitive material;
c) generating an electrical signal by means of an microprocessor unit (12) which is
determined from the steps a) and b) and
d) using said electrical signal for controlling the electrolytic current of the silver
recovery system.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the amount of silver contained in
the fixing bath and the electrolytic current controlled accordingly are determined every

ten seconds.
Method according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the power supplied to the
silver recovery system is cut off when a predetermined amount of silver has been

deposited on the cathode.
