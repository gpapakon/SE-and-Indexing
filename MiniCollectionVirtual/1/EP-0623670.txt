<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to concentrated aqueous based surfactant
compositions containing high levels of surfactant and/or electrolyte which
would normally provide either a product with an undesirably high viscosity,
or one which separates into two or more phases on standing, or exhibits
signs of excessive flocculation of the surfactant.Liquid laundry detergents have a number of advantages compared with powders
which have led to their taking a substantial proportion of the total laundry
detergent market. The need to suspend sparingly soluble builders such as
sodium tripolyphosphate, or insoluble builders such as zeolite in the
pourable aqueous surfactant medium led to the development of structured
surfactants. These are pseudoplastic compositions in which the
structurant is a surfactant or a surfactant/water lyotropic mesophase.The introduction of compact powders containing higher concentrations of
active ingredient than the traditional powders has challenged the trend
towards liquids. There is a market requirement for more concentrated
liquids to meet this challenge, and in particular concentrated aqueous
surfactant compositions containing dissolved or suspended builder salts.
The addition of high levels of surfactant and/or dissolved electrolyte can
promote flocculation of the structured surfactant resulting in high
viscosities and/or instability.The problem of suspending water-insoluble or sparingly soluble pesticides in
a fluid medium has called for new approaches to avoid the use of
environmentally unacceptable solvents. Structured surfactant systems
represent one such approach. Flocculation of the systems, together with
crystal growth of the suspended solids has, however, been a serious
limitation on the development of suitable products. Dyes and pigments, which are water-insoluble or sparingly soluble also need
to be suspended in pourable liquid concentrates to avoid handling fine
powders when preparing dyebaths, or to provide printing inks.Attempts to suspend dyes and pigments in structured surfactants have been
hindered by the tendency of the surfactant structure to flocculate or break
down in the presence of the polyelectrolytes which are commonly added to
pigments prior to milling, and which act as milling aids.Cosmetic, toiletry and pharmaceutical formulations also frequently require
the preparation of stable suspensions of dispersed solids or liquids in a
pourable aqueous medium which may require to be highly concentrated with
respect to electrolyte, surfactant or both, or to
