pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R¹, R² and R³ may be the same or different from one another and each represents 

hydrogen, lower alkyl, alkyl or propargyl; R⁴ represents cycloalkyl, -(CH₂)
n
-R⁵ (wherein R⁵ represents optionally 
substituted aryl or optionally substituted heterocyclic group, and n represents an integer of 0 to 4) of group (A) wherein Y¹ 

and Y² may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, fluorine or methyl, and Z represents optionally 
substituted aryl, group (B) (wherein R⁶ represents hydrogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, nitro or 

amino, and m represents an integer of 1 to 3), or optionally substituted heterocyclic group; and X¹ and X² may be the same 
or different from each other and each represents O or S.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antidepressant
containing a xanthine derivative or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient.It is known that adenosine antagonistic action is
found in compounds represented by Formula (A) in which R1a
and R2a represent propyl, R3a represents hydrogen, and R4a
represents substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, aromatic
heterocyclic group, cycloalkyl, styryl, or phenylethyl [J.
Med. Chem., 34, 1431 (1991)]. Further, Japanese Published
Unexamined Patent Application No. 26516/72, discloses as cerebral
stimulants, compounds represented by Formula (B) in which
R1b and R2b independently represent methyl or ethyl, R3b
represents methyl, Y1b and Y2b represent hydrogen, and Zb 
represents phenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl. WO92/06976
discloses, as compounds having an adenosine A2 receptor
antagonistic activity and therapeutic effects on asthma and
osteoporosis, compounds represented by Formula (B) in which
R1b and R2b independently represent hydrogen, propyl, butyl,
or allyl, R3b represents hydrogen or lower alkyl, Y1b and Y2b
independently represent hydrogen or methyl, and Zb
represents phenyl, pyridyl, imidazolyl, furyl, or thienyl
unsubstituted or substituted by 1 to 3 substituents such as
lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, halogen, amino, and
nitro. Furthermore, other compounds represented by Formula
(B) are known. One is 8-styryl caffeine which is a compound
of Formula (B) in which R1b, R2b, and R3b represent methyl,
Y1b and Y2b represent hydrogen, and Zb represents phenyl
[Chem. Ber., 119, 1525 (1986)]. Another is a compound of
Formula (B) in which R1b, R2b, and R3b represent methyl, Y1b
and Y2b represent hydrogen, and Zb represents pyridyl,
quinolyl, or methoxy-substituted or unsubstituted
benzothiazolyl [Chem. Abst., 60, 1741h (1964)]. However,
there is no description with regard to the pharmacologic
action of any of these compounds.It is clinically well known that the conventional
antidepressant exhibits little effect in a single
administration, and the effect is observed after at least
about two weeks' consecutive administration. With the
conventional antidepressant, the enhancement of clonidine-induced
aggressive behavior in mice is observed after at
least ten days' consecutive administration [J. Neural
Transmission, 52, 189 (1981)].The present invention relates to an antidepressant
containing as an active ingredient a xanthine derivative or
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, the xanthine
derivative being represented by Formula (I):
