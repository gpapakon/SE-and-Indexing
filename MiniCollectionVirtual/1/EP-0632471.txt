<ABSTRACT>
A permanent magnet is obtained by pulverizing, 
molding and sintering a starting material containing an alloy 

ingot. The alloy ingot contains not less than 90% by volume 
of prismatic crystals each having a prismatic crystal grain 

size of 0.1 to 50 µm along a short axis thereof and a 
prismatic crystal grain size of larger than 100 µm and not 

larger than 300 µm along a long axis thereof, and is obtained 
by uniformly solidifying by a single roll method a molten 

alloy containing 25 to 31% by weight of a rare earth metal, 
0.5 to 1.5% by weight of boron and iron under cooling 

conditions of a cooling rate of higher than 500°C/sec. and not 
higher than 10,000°C/sec. and a supercooling degree of 50 to 

500°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of preparing a permanent magnet with 
excellent magnetic properties containing a rare earth metal, 
boron and iron. Permanent magnet alloy ingots are generally produced 
by a metal mold casting method consisting in casting molten 
alloy in a metal mold. If the molten alloy is to be 
solidified by the metal mold casting method, it is heat 
conduction through the casting mold that determines the rate 
of heat removal during the initial stage of the heat removal 
process for the molten alloy. However, as solidification 
proceeds, heat conduction between the casting mold and the 
solidified phase or in the solidifying phase determines the 
rate of heat conduction. Even though the cooling capacity of 
the metal mold is improved, the inner portions of the ingot 
and those portions of the ingot in the vicinity of the casting 
mold are subjected to different cooling conditions. Such 
phenomenon is the more pronounced, the thicker the ingot 
thickness. The result is that in the case of a larger 
difference between the cooling conditions in the inner 
portions of the ingot and those in the vicinity of the ingot 
surface, there exists a large quantity of initial crystals of 
γ-Fe in the portion of the cast structure towards the high  
 
residual magnetic flux in the magnet composition, with the 
result that an α-Fe phase having a grain size of 10 to 300 µm 
is left in the cast structure at a mid portion of the ingot, 
while the rare earth metal rich phase surrounding the main 
phase is also increased in crystal grain size. On the other hand, the ingot is usually pulverized 
during the pulverization step in the magnet production process 
to a grain size of several microns. However, since the ingot 
produced by the above-mentioned metal mold casting process 
contains a phase rich in α-Fe and a coarse-grained rare earth 
metal rich phase, which are difficult to pulverize, there 
results non-uniform crystal grain distribution of the ingot 
powders produced on pulverization, with the result that 
orientation of magnetic domains and sinterability are lowered 
and hence the magnetic properties of the ultimate permanent 
magnet are deteriorated. Although prismatic crystals having a short axis 
length of 0.1 to 50 µm and a long axis length of 0.1 to 100 µm 
are known to exist in the structure of the ingot produced by 
the above-mentioned metal mold casting method, the content of 
these crystals is minor and unable to influence the magnetic 
properties favorably. There has also been
