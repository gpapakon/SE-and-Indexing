<ABSTRACT>
Bisphosphine oxide monomers and homologs 
thereof may be incorporated into polycarbonates in order to 

obtain a flame retardant polymer. More particularly, 
bis[2,5-(diphenylphosphine oxide)]
-1,4-hydroquinone and 
homologs thereof may be used to prepare flame retardant 

polycarbonates that retain high glass transition 
temperature and high impact resistances.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new compositions of
matter and more particularly to bisphosphine oxide
monomers and polycarbonates derived therefrom. The
resulting polycarbonates unexpectedly retain high glass
transition temperatures, high impact resistances and flame
retardancy.Polycarbonates are a well known class of high
impact resistant thermoplastic resins characterized by
optical clarity, high ductility as well as other advantageous
properties. They are frequently employed as lenses and
windows as a result of their transparency. Bisphenol A
polycarbonate (BPA) is the predominant commercially
available resin of this type. It is derived from 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane,
and ordinarily has a glass transition
temperature of about 150Â°C.It is of increasing interest to prepare
polycarbonates which, while retaining the ductility of
bisphenol A polycarbonates, have higher glass transition
temperatures and are therefore more resistant to softening
when heated. Moreover, there is need for polycarbonates
which possess flame retardant properties since they are,
for instance, conventionally used in the automotive and
aircraft industries. Several flame retardant agents have
been utilized in an attempt to produce flame retardant
polycarbonates. For example, alkali metal salts of strong 
sulfonic acids are commonly used. However, when
incorporated into the polycarbonate, the resulting polymer
is hydrolytically sensitive. Further, when using these salts,
it is also necessary to employ drip inhibitors or gas phase
flame retardant agents. This is not ideal since drip
inhibitors destroy the clarity of the polymer and gas phase
retardants are often halogenated which creates problems
with corrosion and toxicity. As an alternative to the above,
phosphorus containing compounds such as
triphenylphosphate have been used. When blended with a
base polycarbonate, some flame retardant properties are
observed. However, the resulting polymer blends are not
desirable since they possess low glass transition
temperatures (Tg) and low impact resistance when
compared to the base resin.The present invention is based on the discovery
of bis[2,5-(diphenylphosphine oxide)]-1,4-hydroquinone and
homologs thereof, and their incorporation into
polycarbonates. The resulting bisphosphine oxide
substituted polycarbonates are expected to exhibit
improved flame retardancy since they possess phosphine
oxide groups which increase polycarbonate limiting oxygen
index values. Additionally, they are expected to retain high
Tg values and impact
