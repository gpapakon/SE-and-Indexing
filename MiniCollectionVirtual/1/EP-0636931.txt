<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a substrate having on the surface thereof 
window-shaped coating films and a frame-shaped, 
functional coating film having light-screening 
properties at the regions not occupied with the window-shaped 
coating films. The method of the present 
invention is particularly useful for producing a color 
filter used in a color liquid crystal display (LCD), 
which has window-shaped, colored coating films and a 
frame-shaped, functional film having a function of 
screening unnecessary lights or achieving other 
desirable properties. This method is particularly 
useful for production of a color filter, which is used 
in a matrix type color display formed using a thin film 
transistor (TFT) and a color filter. Liquid crystal displays have so far been used 
for goods with a small-sized display such as the so-called 
pocket-sized television. However, the size of 
liquid crystal displays has rapidly been enlarged in 
recent years. The image quality of liquid crystal 
displays has also been improved by the development from 
TN liquid crystals to STN liquid crystals and active 
driving elements exemplified by TFT, which has enabled 
the commercialization of goods with a liquid crystal 
display having as high image quality as cathode-ray  
 
tubes. Various studies have been conducted for 
improving the image quality and productivity of the 
color displays using TFT. Of these studies, the method 
for forming a light screening film called a black matrix 
that prevents light leakage toward TFT and improves the 
image quality (apparent contrast) and the shape of the 
light screening film are of great concern. As the method for forming a lattice-form 
frame-shaped, functional film at the regions not 
occupied with colored, window-shaped films for the 
production of a color filter used for colorization of 
LCD, there are known methods utilizing printing techniques 
such as silk screen method, offset method, etc. There is also known a method for forming a 
functional coating film as a black matrix in the gaps of 
stripe-form colored coating films, which comprises 
forming stripe-form colored coating films on a plurality 
of parallel stripe-form conductive circuits arranged on 
a transparent substrate by an electro-deposition method; 
coating a negative photoresist composition capable of 
giving a functional coating film on the whole surface of 
the substrate so as to cover the stripe-form colored 
coating films, followed by forming the photoresist film;
