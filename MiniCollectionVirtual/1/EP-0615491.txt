<ABSTRACT>
A tarpaulin comprising a fabric coated with a plastics material, preferably PVC, polyamide or polyprene, is provided with a decoration of a reflecting material by anchoring a reflecting sheet to a piece of tarpaulin cloth, whose plastics coating is of the same type as or is compatible with that of the tarpaulin, by high frequency welding or heat application, and then applying the piece of tarpaulin cloth provided with reflecting sheet, optionally formed in the desired shape, to the tarpaulin by hot air fusion. The reflecting sheet is preferably a retroreflecting PVC sheet of the naked prism type which is anchored to the piece of tarpaulin cloth by high frequency welding. Other types of reflective sheet may be applied to the piece of tarpaulin or directly to the tarpaulin by means of an adhesive and anchored thereto by placing a transparent flexible polymeric film on top of the reflecting sheet with its edges extending beyond those of the sheet and high frequency welding it to the piece of tarpaulin or the tarpaulin itself along the edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a tarpaulin comprising a fabric 
coated with a plastics material, preferably PVC, polyamide 
or polyprene, and provided with a reflecting decoration, as 
well as a method of providing a tarpaulin with such a 
reflecting decoration. Today tarpaulins usually consist of a fabric coated with a 
plastics material. The fabric must be strong and durable and 
is therefore most frequently made of polyester. The plastics 
coating must likewise be strong and durable, and it must 
moreover have a certain toughness and flexibility. It is 
mostly made of PVC or of a polyamide, such as nylon or 
aramide, or a polyprene, such as chloroprene rubber. 
Tarpaulins are used for many cover purposes, e.g. within the 
building industry, and in particular for covering trucks. 
They are also used for making larger tents, e.g. for use in 
temporary military quarters and refugee camps as well as for 
public events. It is common practice to print logos, company names, 
slogans, instructions and other decorations on truck 
tarpaulins, for informative and for advertising purposes. 
It would be a great advantage, both with respect to the 
advertising value and the traffic safety, if such 
decorations could be made of a reflecting material or could 
be combined with reflecting stripes or patterns, e.g. along 
the edges of the tarpaulins. In particular, this could 
contribute to making the trucks visible at night when the 
usually dark tarpaulins are otherwise difficult to see. 
According to UN rules on traffic safety, trucks and trailers 
are to be provided with rear truck planks, i.e. usually 
aluminium plates with yellow reflection, downwardly on the 
rear end. In general, the ordinary rules are that rearward  
 
reflectors are to be red, lateral reflectors to be yellow 
and forward reflectors to be white. However, reflectors 
arranged on the body or chassis of trucks will often be 
coated with dirt, and even when visible they do not give a 
sufficient impression of the size of the vehicle. Various reflective materials may be considered for application 
on tarpaulins. Paint or inks containing reflecting 
pigments are not suitable, partly because they are not 
durable exposed to wind and weather. The best reflection 
effect is obtained with so-called retroreflecting films or 
sheets, of which substantially two types are known: One is 
the glass bead type comprising a large number of fine glass 
beads embedded with specular base in a plastics sheet. The 
other is the prism (or cube corner) type with a large
