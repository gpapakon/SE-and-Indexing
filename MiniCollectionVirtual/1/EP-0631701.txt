Atomic beam in particular caesium beam resonator advantageously for
producing a reference frequency for the frequency stabilization of a

crystal-controlled oscillator and comprising, mounted in series in the
direction of the beam, a source of atomic beam (2), a first state selector

(3), an interrogation zone (4) comprising a wave guide having a
resonant cavity with two arms of the Ramsey type, the arms of which

are flown through transversely by the atomic beam, a second state
selector (5), an atom detector device (15) for producing the useful

output signal of the resonator and a device (20,25) for the injection into
the resonant cavity(16) of an interrogation signal produced from the

signal of the said oscillator so as to produce within each arm (17,18) of
the said cavity a hyperfrequency interrogation field interracting with the

atoms of the atomic beam, the interrogation zone being surrounded by a
magnetic shielding (10) producing in the internal space, a static and

homogeneous magnetic field, characterized in that the device (20,25) for
the injection of the hyperfrequency energy into the resonant cavity (16)

is a coupling device which is adapted to impose within the cavity a
number of odd modes so that both interrogation fields be in phase

opposition and that the response of the resonator exhibits a minimum at
the resonance frequency f
0
.
Resonator according to claim 1, characterized in that the coupling
device (20) is a device of the electric coupling type.
Resonator according to claim 2, characterized in that the electric
coupling device is made in the shape of an antenna (20) dipping into the

resonant cavity (16) through a passageway (22) formed in the wall of
the wave guide body (4) so that the axis of the antenna coincides with

the intersection of the planes of symmetry of the cavity. 
Resonator according to claim 3, characterized in that the antenna (20) is
constituted by the central core of a coaxial cable (25) or its extension

one end of which is connected to the interrogation signal generator and
the other end of which is connected to the wave guide (4) with a

resonant cavity (16) and which extends through the shielding envelope
(10) through a hole (26) with a small diameter advantageously

corresponding to the diameter of the cable (25) and located at a selected
place in order to not disturb the static magnetic field.
Resonator according to claim 4, characterized in that the body (4) with a
cavity (16) as a wave guide curved in the plane (E) and resonating

according to a number of odd modes exhibits the shape of a C the arms
(17) and (18) of which are flown through by the atomic beam (2) and in

that the cable (25) is mounted onto the inner wall of the base of the C
which is turned towards both arms (17) and (18).
Resonator according to one of the claims 4 or 5, characterized in that the
hole (26) for the passage of the cable (25) through the shielding (10) is

lying at the level of one end of the shielding.
Resonator according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that
the static magnetic field (B
0
) of the interrogation zone (4) is produced
by a coil integrated into the wall of the shielding envelope and

advantageously made in the shape of a printed circuit with substantially
parallel conducting tracks.
Resonator according to one of claims 3 to 7, characterized in that that
end of the antenna (20) which dips into the resonant cavity (16) is held

by a body of a dielectric material fastened inside of the cavity.
Resonator according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that
the wave guide body (4) comprises in the central portion of the base a

side wave guide nosepiece (31) permitting the injection of the
interrogation energy. 
Resonator according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that
the modulation amplitude of the interrogation signal in the zone about

the resonance frequency f
0
 exhibits a value (w
m
) which is very small
with respect to the line width (W) of the response curve of the resonator.
