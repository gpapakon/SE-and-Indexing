<ABSTRACT>
An infinitely variable speed transmission 
comprising a variable diameter drive pulley (36) on a 

primary shaft (20), a variable diameter driven pulley 
(37) on a secondary shaft (35), wherein the driven 

pulley comprises a movable cone (37
b
) mounted on the 
secondary shaft for joint rotation therewith and for 

axial displacement relative to the secondary shaft 
towards and away from a fixed cone (37
a
), wherein a 
substantially tubular shell (80), rigidly attached to 

the movable cone (37
b
), has a constricted end (80
b
) 
loosely fitted over the secondary shaft, and wherein 

the interior of the shell is divided by a partition 
(39
a
) into an actuation chamber (39
b
) and a 
counterbalance chamber (80
a
). 
For lubricating some moving parts of the 
transmission when the secondary shaft (35) is in 

rotation at such low speed that the counterbalance 
chamber (80
a
) requires no fluid for counterbalancing 
the centrifugal force of the fluid in the actuation 

chamber, a fluid outlet (81
a
) of a fluid passageway 
(83, 84) in the secondary shaft is so positioned that 

the constricted end (80
b
) of the shell (80) directs the 
fluid issuing from the fluid outlet to the exterior of 

the shell, rather than into the counterbalance chamber, 
at a prescribed high speed ratio of the primary shaft 

to the secondary shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transmissions, to 
infinitely variable speed transmissions, and to belt 
transmissions well suited for vehicular use, among 
other applications. More specifically, the invention 
deals with improvements in or relating to variable 
diameter pulley systems included in belt transmissions, 
particularly to the driven pulley and hydraulic circuit 
means associated therewith as defined in the first part 
of claim 1 and known for instance from US-A 4 494 942. Belt transmissions have been known and used 
extensively on motor vehicles. They include a variable 
diameter pulley system comprising a drive pulley on a 
transmission main shaft (primary shaft) and a driven 
pulley on a countershaft (secondary shaft), with a V-belt 
extending around the two pulleys. Each V-groove 
pulley is divided into a pair of halves known as pulley 
cones. One of the pulley cones is axially displaceable 
towards and away from the other in order to 
controllably vary the effective diameter of the pulley. 
Hydraulic fluid pressure is usually employed for 
controlling the axial position of the movable pulley 
cone with respect to the fixed pulley cone. Difficulties have been encountered in controlling 
the axial position of the movable cone of the driven 
pulley, in particular, as its speed of rotation becomes 
very high with upshifting. The hydraulic mainline 
fluid fed into the actuating fluid chamber of the 
driven pulley movable cone develops a centrifugal force 
such that its axial component tends to displace the 
movable cone in the direction opposite to the desired 
direction of cone movement for upshifting. It has 
therefore been suggested to provide a counterbalance 
chamber opposite the actuation chamber. This  
 
counterbalance chamber is supplied as required, with 
fluid under pressure, so that the centrifugal force of 
the fluid in the actuation chamber may be 
counterbalanced by that of the fluid in the 
counterbalance chamber. Japanese Laid Open Patent Application No. 57-171154 
(= and US-A 4 494 942) represents an example of such known counterbalancing 
means. This prior application teaches to direct the 
outflow of hydraulic fluid from a torque converter into 
the counterbalance chamber. An objection to this 
scheme is that it is applicable only to transmissions 
of the class incorporating a hydraulic torque 
converter. Additionally, the outflow from the torque 
converter cannot possibly be passed through a fluid 
cooler prior to introduction into the counterbalance 
chamber. Japanese Laid

An infinitely variable speed transmission 
comprising a variable diameter drive pulley (36) on a 

primary shaft (20), a variable diameter driven pulley 
(37) on a secondary shaft (35), an endless belt (34) 

extending around the drive and driven pulleys for 
imparting the rotation of the primary shaft to the 

secondary shaft at a variable speed ratio depending 
upon the relative effective diameters of the drive and 

driven pulleys, wherein the driven pulley comprises a 
fixed cone (37
a
) fixedly mounted on the secondary shaft, 
and a movable cone (37
b
) mounted on the secondary shaft 
for joint rotation therewith and for axial displacement 

relative to the secondary shaft towards, and away from 
the fixed cone, wherein a substantially tubular shell 

(80), coaxially surrounding the secondary shaft, has an 
enlarged end rigidly attached to the movable cone of 

the driven pulley and a constricted end (80
b
) loosely 
fitted over the secondary shaft, and wherein the 

interior of the shell is divided by a partition element (39
a
) 
into an actuation chamber (39
b
) and a counterbalance 
chamber (80
a
), the actuation chamber being supplied 
with fluid under pressure for controllably moving the 

movable cone, together with the shell attached thereto, 
toward and away from the fixed cone, characterized in 

that the secondary shaft (35) has a fluid passageway 
(83, 84) formed therein with a fluid outlet (81
a
) 
disposed in such an axial position on the secondary 

shaft that the constricted end (80
b
) of the shell (80) 
is positioned substantially opposite the fluid outlet 

at a prescribed high speed ratio of the primary shaft 
(20) to the secondary shaft (35) in order to direct the 

fluid issuing under pressure from the fluid outlet to 
the exterior of the shell, and that the constricted end 

of the shell admits the pressurized fluid from the 
fluid outlet (81
a
) into the counterbalance chamber  
 

(80
a
) in order to counterbalance the centrifugal force 
of the fluid in the actuation chamber (39
b
) when the 
movable cone (37
b
) of the driven pulley (37) travels 
away from the fixed cone (37
a

rotation of the secondary shaft higher than that at the 

prescribed high speed ratio. 
An infinitely variable speed transmission as 
claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 

constricted end (80
b
) of the shell (80) is shaped to 
provide a surface (80
c
) for directing the pressurized 
fluid issuing from the fluid outlet (81
a
) in a 
direction away from the driven pulley (37). 
An infinitely variable speed transmission as

(89) of mainline pressure, characterized in that the 
counterbalance chamber (80
a
) is supplied with the 
pressurized fluid from a source (90, 91) of lubrication 

pressure.
