<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of establishing a subscriber connection in a data transmission network and to a subscriber network. In the method a subscriber connection is established by forming a first portion (13) of a transmission connection on the subscriber (12) side in an electrical form and a second portion (15) of the connection on the exchange (16, PK; SK) side in an optical form by means of an optical fibre, whereby there are optoelectric converters (20) at both ends of said second portion (15) of the connection. In order to get rid of transmission devices of an active subscriber network, which devices are to be positioned in the field and are e.g. difficult to maintain, a signal transmitted by a transmission device (14) of a subscriber (12) is connected, without correcting the attenuation and distortion caused by said first portion, via an optoelectric converter (20) to said second portion (15), and that, correspondingly, a signal is transmitted from the exchange (16, PK, SK) towards the subscriber (12), which signal is intended for said first portion (13) and is at first connected via the optoelectric converter (20) to said second portion (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of establishing
a subscriber connection and to a subscriber network.
In the method a subscriber connection is established
by forming a first portion of a transmission
connection on the subscriber side in an electrical
form and a second portion of the connection on the
exchange side in an optical form by means of an optical
fibre, whereby there are optoelectric converters
at both ends of said second portion of the connection.
A subscriber network according to the invention
conforms, in turn, with the preamble of the attached
claim 4.Optical fibre is a self-evident choice for a
transmission medium of a trunk network, because trunk
connections generally require a large transmission
capacity, transmission distances used are long and
cable routes ready for use are often available. On
the other hand, the situation in a subscriber connection
is often quite the opposite and sufficient reasons
for using optical fibre rarely exist.Naturally, with a continuously increasing need
for speed, the situation is changing in a more advantageous
direction for the optical fibre see for example EP-A-436 820, but no significant
savings can be expected in the total costs,
mainly resulting from cable installation costs. A
wish is, however, to fit out the subscriber network
as well with as much optical fibre as possible, because
it is obvious that it will be required in the
future. Cots of reconstructing a subscriber network
are very high and, as to the time, it is a matter of
decades in this connection. Consequently, it would be
worth while being prepared for coming needs and providing 
facilities for the future at present already.Accordingly, teleoperators try to increase the
number of fibres in a subscriber network, as far as
it is economically possible. In practice there are
two possibilities of increasing the number of fibres.
Firstly, optical fibre can be installed at relatively
low additional costs in connection with cable supplements.
However, the fibre often remains awaiting future
users. The other way is to find customers who
need high speed and thus optical fibre and who are
ready to pay for it.The fact is that high costs are the worst obstacle
to introducing the fibre into the subscriber
network.In a so-called active subscriber network, there
are transmission devices also "in the field" (in the
area between a terminal exchange and a subscriber).
The object of an active subscriber network is to divide
the costs of constructing a transmission connection
among several subscribers and to

<CLAIMS>
A method of establishing a subscriber connection
in a data transmission network, in which

method a subscriber connection is established by
forming a first portion (13) of a transmission connection

on the subscriber (12) side in an electrical
form and a second portion (15) of the connection on

the exchange (16, PK; SK) side in an optical form by
means of an optical fibre, whereby there are optoelectric

converters (20) at both ends of said second
portion (15) of the connection, 
characterized

in that a signal transmitted by a transmission
device (14) of a subscriber (12) is connected,

without correcting the attenuation and distortion
caused by said first portion, via an optoelectric

converter (20) to said second portion (15), while
correcting said attenuation and distortion after the

second portion (15), and that, correspondingly, a
signal is transmitted from the exchange (16, PK; SK)

towards the subscriber (12), which signal is intended
for said first portion (13) and is at first connected

via the optoelectric converter (20) to said second
portion (15), whereby transmission is performed in

analog form such that signals are analog at the ends
of said second portion.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that data of more than one channel
are transmitted by the same optical fibre (15).
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized

in that the signal of each channel is
temporarily digitized for the time of a transmission

performed by the optical fibre (15).
A subscriber network for effecting a method
according to claim 1, comprising subscriber connections 

extending from an exchange (PK; SK) to a subscriber,
at least a part of which connections comprise

a first portion (13), by which a signal is
transmitted in an electrical form, and a second portion

(15), by which a signal is transmitted in an
optical form, whereby said second portion (15) comprises

optoelectric converters (20) at both ends

characterized
 in that said
second portion (15) is connected by means of an electric

coupling in an analog form directly to the
first portion (13), on the one hand, and substantially

hand.
A subscriber network according to
claim 4, 
characterized
 in that said
subscriber connection is established between a terminal

exchange (PK) and a subscriber (12).
A subscriber network according to

characterized
 in that said
subscriber connection is established between a tandem

exchange (SK) and a subscriber (12), whereby said
second portion (15) is formed between a tandem exchange

(SK) and a terminal exchange (PK) and said
first portion (13) between a terminal exchange (PK)

and a subscriber (12).
