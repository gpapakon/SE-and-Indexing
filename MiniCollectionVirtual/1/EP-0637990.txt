<CLAIMS>
Membrane, in particular a membrane for gas separation and 
pervaporation, on the basis of graft copolymers, obtainable by 

incompletely cross-linking in solution a first polymer with the 
following repeated unit of the general
 
Formula I: 


 
wherein the R1 and R2 radicals, which may be the same or 

different, represent a linear, branched or cyclic C1-C12 
hydrocarbon radical, with the proviso that at least one of the 

radicals R1 and R2 represents a linear or branched hydrocarbon 
radical with a terminal C=C double bond, where appropriate a 

second polymer, which possesses C=C double bonds in the main 
chain or in the side chain, and a low-molecular siloxane copolymer 

capable of a hydrosilylation reaction, applying this 
solution to an untreated or treated, per se known carrier, and 

then cross-linking the solution to insolubility via the double 
bonds present in the supportive co-polymer. 
Membrane according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
second polymer is an alternating copolymer with the following 

repeating unit of the general
 
Formula II: 


  
 

whereby 10 to 100% of the radicals R1 and/or R2, which may be the 
same or different, and which represent a linear, branched or 

cyclic C1 - C18 hydrocarbon radical, possess in particular a 
terminal C=C double bond. 
Membrane according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
second polymer has been manufactured from cyclic olefins via a 

substitution reaction. 
Membrane according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the in itself known carrier consists of a 

0.1 to 1 µm thick layer of a particularly readily gas-permeable 
polymer. 
Membrane, according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
particularly readily gas-permeable polymer consists of poly 

(dimethylsiloxane) or of poly (trimethylsilylpropine). 
Membrane, according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the graft copolymer is present as a film 

with a thickness of 0.5 to 200 µm. 
Graft copolymers, so obtainable, that a first polymer and a 
siloxane copolymer, as defined respectively in Claim 1, as well 

as a second polymer where appropriate as claimed in Claims 1 to 
3 are partly or completely cross-linked in solution. 
Process for manufacturing the membrane according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the first polymer as claimed 

in Claim 1 together with a low-molecular siloxane polymer capable 
of the hydrosilylation reaction as claimed in Claim 1 as well as, 

where appropriate, in the presence of the second polymer as 
claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3 and a catalyst, in particular for 

hydrosilylation, are partly pre-crosslinked in a solvent, whereby 
the degree of pre-crosslinking is determined in particular by gel 

chromatography, the solution so obtained is applied to a treated  
 

or untreated, per se known carrier and then the crosslinking is 
continued until the polymer obtained becomes insoluble. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
siloxane co-polymer is used in a quantity of 5 to 10 % by weight, 

with respect to the total weight of the polymers used.
