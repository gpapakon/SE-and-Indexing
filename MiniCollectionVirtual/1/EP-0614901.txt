represented by the following formula (1): 


wherein R¹ and R² are identical with or different from 
each other and mean individually a phenyl group which may 

be substituted by a halogen atom or lower alkyl group, or 
denote together a divalent hydrocarbon group, R³ and R⁴ 

are identical with or different from each other and mean

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel phosphine
compound and a transition metal complex which contains
this compound as a ligand and is useful as a catalyst for
a variety of asymmetric synthetic reactions.Many transition metal complexes have heretofore been
used as catalysts for organic synthetic reactions. In
particular, noble metal complexes are expensive, but safe
and easy to handle, and so many synthetic researches
making use of them as catalysts have been made. A great
number of reports that organic synthetic reactions said to
be infeasible by former methods or processes were made
possible have been presented one after another.Among others, complexes obtained by coordinating an
optically active tertiary phosphine to a transition metal
such as rhodium, palladium, ruthenium or nickel often have
excellent performance as catalysts for asymmetric
synthetic reactions. In order to enhance the performance
of these catalysts, a number of phosphine compounds having 
a special structure have been developed to date
["Organometallic Chemistry", Kagaku Sosetsu (The Elements
of Chemistry), 32, edited by The Chemical Society of
Japan, 237-238 (1982)].Asymmetric hydroformylation reactions making use of
a transition metal-optically active phosphine complex have
been known. More specifically, there are described an
asymmetric hydroformylation reaction making use of a
rhodium complex containing, as a ligand, optically active
2,3-O-isopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane
(hereinafter called DIOP) in Journal of
Organic Chemistry, 46, 4422-4427 (1981); the asymmetric
hydroformylation reaction of olefins making use of a
rhodium complex containing, as a ligand, an optically
active bidentate phosphine (DIOP or the like) in Bulletin
of The Chemical Society of Japan, 52, 2605-2608 (1979);
and the asymmetric hydroformylation reaction of methyl α-acetamidoacrylate
making use of a rhodium complex
containing, as a ligand, an optically active bidentate
phosphine, e.g., DIOP in Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 10, 693-696
(1990).As a ligand composed of an optically active tertiary
phosphite, a bis (triarylphosphite) having an optically
active BINAP structure is described in, for example,
Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 3, 583-586 (1992), wherein BINAP
means 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl. The 
asymmetric hydroformylation reaction of vinyl acetate
making use of a rhodium complex containing this compound
as a ligand is described therein.As described above, many particular phosphine
compounds have heretofore been
