<ABSTRACT>
A tamper indicating package comprising a container (30) 
having a neck (31) with a threaded finish (31a), an annular 

bead (37) on the 
neck, a plastic closure (32) which includes a base wall (33) and a 

depending 
peripheral skirt (34) having threads (32a) interengaging the 

threads (31a) of 
the container, and a tamper indicating band (35) attached to the 

skirt by a plurality of weakened portions defining a line of 
severing (36). An annular flange (40) extends axially upwardly and 

inwardly from the tamper indicating band toward the base wall (33) 
of the closure (32) and comprises a first continuous annular flange 

portion (42) connected to the band by a hinge portion (41) and a second 
portion (43). The second portion (43) comprises a plurality of segment 

portions extending upwardly and inwardly from the first 
continuous portion with the free ends of the segment portions 

engaging beneath the bead (37) on the container (30) when the 
closure (32) is 

threaded onto the container. The flange (40) is bent intermediate 
its ends so that the second portion (43) extends inwardly at a greater 

angle than the first continuous flange portion (42). The segments (43) 
are separated by narrow slits (S) such that when the closure (32) is 

fully applied on a container (30), and the closure (32) is rotated to 
remove the closure, the free ends of the adjacent segment 

portions (43) engage a bead (37) on the container (30) and are moved 

radially 
inwardly and the sides of the slits (S) adjacent the free ends 

contact one another in an interfering manner to inhibit reversal 
of the segment portions and enhance resistance to removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tamper indicating closures 
according to the preamble of claim 1. In packaging of containers having closures thereon, 
it has been common to provide tamper indicating packages wherein 
the tamper indicating band is connected to the closure along a 
weakened line provided by a plurality of bridges or a scoreline 
and interengaging means between the band and the container are 
such that when the closure is unthreaded from the container, 
the band is severed along the bridge portions to indicate that 
the closure has been tampered with. In U.S. Patent No. 4,394,918 issued to Jean Gressen 
on July 26, 1983, a threaded closure carries a hold ring that 
is joined to the bottom of the cap skirt by a series of breakable 
tabs and the hold ring has an inside diameter that is at least 
equal to the outside diameter of the cap skirt. A plurality 
of lock lugs supported on the ring are inclined upwardly and 
inwardly and are intended to hook behind a collar or mating ring 
on the container neck to prevent the hold ring from being lifted 
off the container neck when the cap is unscrewed. In U.S. Patent No. 4,550,844, having a common assignee 
with the present application, there is disclosed and claimed 
an arrangement wherein a continuous annular flange extends from 
the lower end of the tamper indicating band and is inclined 
upwardly and inwardly. Such an arrangement is effective but  
 
has the disadvantage in that continuous flange requires excessive 
force to apply the closure to the container in certain extreme 
tolerance conditions. In an effort to reduce the force required to apply 
the closure, it has heretofore been suggested in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,653,657 that the free edge of the continuous annular 
flange be provided with a plurality of segments to facilitate 
application of the closure. U.S. Patent No. 4,807,771 proposes the use of a 
plurality of spaced-apart ring segments on the tamper indicating 
band to define independently foldable ring segments and a 
plurality of resilient tabs connected to each end of each ring 
segment so that the free ends of the tabs bear on the bead or 
ledge of the container. In U.S. Patent 5,090,788, having a common assignee 
with the present application, there is disclosed a tamper 
indicating package comprising a container having a neck with a 
threaded finish, an annular bead on the neck, a plastic closure 
which includes a base wall and a depending peripheral skirt 
having threads interengaging the threads of the container, and 
a tamper
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tamper indicating closure adapted to be applied to a 
container having a neck with a threaded finish, and an 

annular bead on said neck, said closure comprising 

a plastic closure which includes a base wall (33) and 
a depending peripheral skirt (34) having threads (32a) 

interengaging the threads of said container, and 
a tamper indicating band (35) attached to said skirt by 
one or more weakened portions (36) defining a line of 

severing, and 
an annular flange (40) extending axially upwardly and 
inwardly from said tamper indicating band (35) toward said 

base wall (33) of said closure,
 
   said annular flange (40) having a plurality of 

circumferentially spaced narrow slits (5) extending from the 
free edge thereof and defining a plurality of adjacent 

segment portions (43), characterised in that
 
   said narrow slits (5) have a narrow width such that 

when the closure is fully applied to a container, and the 
closure is rotated to remove the closure, the free ends of 

the adjacent segment portions (43) engage a bead on the 
container and are moved radially inwardly and the sides of 

the slits (5) adjacent the free ends of substantially all 
the segment portions move to contact one another in an 

interfering manner to enhance resistance to removal and 
inhibit tampering. 
A tamper indicating closure as claimed in claim 1 
wherein said flange (40) comprises a first continuous 

annular flange portion (42) connected to an inner surface of 
said tamper indicating band (35) by a hinge (41) spaced 

radially inwardly from said inner surface of the band, and
 
   said flange being bent intermediate its ends to form a 

second portion (43) such that said second portion extends 
inwardly at a greater predetermined angle to the axis of the 

closure than said first continuous flange portion (42), the 
free end of said second portion engaging beneath said bead  

 
on said container when said closure is threaded onto said 

container,
 
   said second portion comprising said plurality of 

circumferentially spaced segment portions (43) separated by 
said narrow slits (5) extending axially upwardly and 

inwardly at said predetermined angles from the continuous 
annular flange portion, said band (35) having an inner 

surface adapted to be engaged by said first continuous 
flange portion when the closure is being removed to cause 

the flange to bend along the bend therein such that when the 
closure is applied to the container, the second portion (43) 

initially engages the bead on the container and flexes at 
the bend to tend to straighten the bend and thereafter the 

first portion (42) flexes relative to the band (35) and the 
free end of the second portion engages beneath the bead. 
A tamper indicating closure as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the sides of said slits (5) are substantially 

parallel. 
A tamper indicating closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 3 wherein the width of said slits is about 0.127 - 

0.254 mm (0.005"-0.0010"). 
A tamper indicating package comprising: 

a container (30) having a neck (31) with a threaded 
finish, 
an annular bead (37) on said neck, and 
a tamper-indicating closure (32) as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4 applied thereto.
