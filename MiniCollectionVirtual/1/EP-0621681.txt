<ABSTRACT>
In a method of controlling start of a refrigerant-circulating 
compressor driven by a brushless motor in a 

refrigerating cycle, the brushless motor at halt is started 
in accordance with asynchronous forced commutation operation 

without use of rotor position detection signals; and 
when the rotor position detection signals can be detected 

predetermined times or more due to synchronous commutations 
during the forced commutation operation, the asynchronous 

forced commutation operation is shifted to synchronous 
commutation starting operation with the use of the rotor 

position detection signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling
start of a compressor driven by a brushless motor at
variable speed in a refrigerating cycle.Recently, a compressor driven by a brushless motor at
variable speed is used for a refrigerating cycle apparatus.
In this brushless motor, a permanent magnet is used as a
rotor to detect angular positions of the rotor, and the
rotor is driven by switching the phases of voltages applied
to three phase windings cyclically on the basis of the
detected angular position signals of the rotor. The motor
of this sort has been widely used more and more recently,
because of such an advantage as a low power loss or a low
heat generation (i.e., a low heat loss of the rotor), as
compared with induction motors (excellent in durability).The refrigerating cycle apparatus which uses the motor
of this sort and a power system for driving the same will
be described hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 9, in which
the refrigerating cycle apparatus is applied to an air
conditioning machine.In Fig. 9, the refrigerating cycle apparatus can be
switched from heating operation to cooling operation or
vice versa by the switching operation of a four-way
switching valve 2. In the heating operation, as shown by
the solid lines, a refrigerant (cooling medium) is circulated
from a compressor 1 to the same compressor 1 by way
of a four-way switching valve 2, an indoor heat exchanger
3, an expansion valve 4, an outdoor heat exchanger 5 and
the four-way switching valve 2. Further, in the cooling
operation, as shown by the dashed lines, the refrigerant
(cooling medium) is circulated from the compressor 1 to the
same compressor 1 by way of the four-way switching valve 
2, the outdoor heat exchanger 5, the expansion valve 4, the
indoor heat exchanger 4 and the four-way switching valve
2. Further, the indoor heat exchanger 3 is provided with
an indoor fan 3a for feeding warm wind (in heating operation)
or cool wind (in the cooling operation) into a room
to be air-conditioned, and the outdoor heat exchanger 5 is
provided with an outdoor fan 5a for promoting heat exchange
between the outdoor heat exchanger and the outside air.As is well known, in the heating operation, the indoor
heat exchanger 3 functions as a heat radiator (condenser)
and the outdoor heat exchanger 5 functions as a heat sink
(evaporator). Further, in the cooling operation, the
indoor heat exchanger 3 functions as a heat sink (evaporator)
and the outdoor heat exchanger 5 functions as a heat
radiator (condenser). The indoor heat
