<ABSTRACT>
An analytic test sheet feeder comprises a 
cylindrical container 11 having an elongated through 

hole 15 formed in a side wall thereof for receiving a 
test sheet, a container support 18 which comprises an 

upper portion having a semi-cylindrical concave surface 
and a hole 20 formed in a central portion of the concave 

surface to permit a test sheet descending from the 
through hole of the container 11 to be taken out 

therethrough 20, and a test sheet delivering stage 31 
which receives and delivers the test sheet descending 

from the through hole 15.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analytic 
test sheet feeder for taking out and supplying small 
strip or rod-like test sheets one by one, which feeder 
is suitable for extracting test sheets one by one with 
high reliability. In clinical examinations in hospitals, 
analytic test sheets are often used for easily examining 
a plurality of analytic items in urine samples and blood 
samples. A test sheet has an elongated strip made of a 
plastic material or the like on which a plurality of 
testing pieces impregnated with reagents are adhered. A known automatic test-sheet analyser in which 
handling of such analytic test sheets is automated is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 
61-91571. This conventional technique has a structure 
in which an arm having a test sheet holder is moved 
between a test sheet feeding mechanism, a sample table 
on which sample containers to immerse test sheets in are 
placed, and a photometric mechanism, and colored test 
sheets are subjected to photometry. The test sheet 
feeding mechanism supplies test sheets one by one to a 
starting position of test-sheet delivery by the arm. In the foregoing test sheet feeding mechanism 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.  
 
61-91571, an elongated test sheet is supplied by sliding 
the bottom of a hopper. Consequently, when a curved 
test sheet is drawn out, other test sheets are apt to be 
caught between the wall and the bottom of the hopper, 
which results in a problem that smooth operation is 
hindered. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an analytic test sheet feeder which can 
automatically supply test sheets smoothly irrespective 
of the shape of the test sheets. An analytic test sheet feeder according to 
this invention comprises container means having a 
cylindrical container which contains a plurality of 
analytic test sheets, the cylindrical container having a 
through hole formed in a wall thereof so that a test 
sheet can be fitted in the through hole, taking-out 
means which reciprocate the cylindrical container to 
rotate around its own axis, fit a test sheet in the 
through hole, and take out the test sheet in the through 
hole out of the cylindrical container while rotation of 
the cylindrical container is stopped, delivery means for 
delivering the test sheet to an outside supplying 
position on the test sheet feeder, and separation means 
which separate the test sheets from one another when two 
or more test sheets are taken out at once and placed on 
the

<CLAIMS>
In an analytic test sheet feeder comprising 
container means for containing a plurality of analytic 

test sheets, taking-out means for taking out the test 
sheets contained in said container means one by one from 

said container means, and delivery means for delivering 
the test sheets taken out by said taking-out means to an 

outside supplying position on the feeder, wherein 
separation means provided in said delivery means for 

separating the taken-out test sheets from one another 
and delivering the same to the outside supplying 

position when two or more test sheets are taken out at 
once by said taking-out means. 
In an analytic test sheet feeder comprising 
container means for containing a plurality of analytic 

test sheets, taking-out means for taking out the test 
sheets contained in said container means one by one from 

said container means, and delivery means for delivering 
the test sheets taken out by said extraction means to an 

outside supplying position on the feeder, the improvement 
comprising separation means are provided in said 

delivery means for separating the taken out test sheets 
from one another and delivering the same to the outside 

supplying position, when two or more test sheets are 
taken out at once by said taking-out means, said separation 

means including advancing means for separating the 
test sheets from one another and feeding each test sheet 

when the test sheets taken out by said taken-out means 
 

are delivered by said delivery means, detection means 
for detecting whether any test sheets remain or not 

after the test sheet is fed, and operation control means 
for repeating operations in such a manner that when the 

existence of any remaining test sheets is detected by 
said detection means, said delivery means are returned 

to the initial position, and the remaining test sheets 
are separated from one another by said advancing means 

and delivered one by one to the outside supplying 
position. 
An analytic test sheet feeder according to 
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said separation means are formed 

in a passage portion for permitting the test sheet to be 
delivered by said delivery means, such that two or more 

test sheets can not be passed. 
In an analytic test sheet feeder comprising 
container means for containing a plurality of analytic 

test sheets, taking-out means for taking the test sheets 
contained in said container means one by one from said 

container means, and delivery means for delivering the 
test sheets taken out by said taking-out means to an 

outside supplying position on the feeder, the improvement 
comprising returning means provided in said 

delivery means for partly returning the plurality of 
taken-out test sheets to said container means, when two 

or more test sheets are taken out at once by said 
taking-out means, thereby allowing the returned test 

sheets to be taken out again.
