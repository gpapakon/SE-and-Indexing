<ABSTRACT>
A particulate co-processed unattrited microcrystalline cellulose: hydrocolloid composition wherein the respective components are present in a weight ratio of from about 99:1 to 70:30. The composition is useful as a spheronizing agent for producing spheroids of uniform size and sphericity and having high drug loadings. The composition is produced by drying a slurry of the microcrystalline cellulose in an aqueous solution of the hydrocolloid. The preferred hydrocolloid is methyl cellulose.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spheronization compositions
and solid pharmaceutical dosage forms based
thereon. More particularly, the invention pertains to a
microcrystalline cellulose:hydrocolloid spheronizing
composition capable of yielding a high percentage of
spheroids of uniform size and sphericity and containing
highly elevated drug levels.In the food and pharmaceutical arts, it has long
been the practice to prepare and utilize particulate
formulations in which the individual particles are of a
spherical configuration. Such contoured particulates
afford a number of advantages. The sphere has the lowest
surface to volume ratio. Spheres pack evenly in
containers for ease of accurately measuring quantities
of particulate materials by volume. In the field of
pharmaceuticals, the sphere is the ideal geometric solid
for the application of film coatings to effect controlled
release of drugs and/or medicinals.A number of methods have been developed for producing
spheronized pharmaceutical compositions. For
instance, the preparation of spherical oral dosage forms
in pill molds and pellet presses dates back many years.
Since these early times, many improvements have been
made in the technology.In recent years, a method of producing spherical
particulates that is attracting increased attention of
the pharmaceutical community is that of spheronization.
The essential features of this technique typically involve
the steps of: forming a dry blend of powdered
components; wetting the dry blend with a liquid, usually
aqueous, in the presence of a binding agent to give a
plastic-like mass or granulation; extruding the mass
through a screen or dye to form a spaghetti extrudate;
cutting the extrudate into short cylinders followed by a
rounding stage in which the cylinders are rolled on a
grooved surface into spheres. For more detailed information 
on the process reference is made to "A New
Technique for the Production of Spherical Particles" by
A. D. Reynolds in Manufacturing Chemist & Aerosol News,
June 1970.Much of the interest in spheronization as a means
of producing spherical particulates, or spheroids as
they are commonly known, comes in the wake of the ever
growing use of multiparticulate controlled-release oral
dosage forms. These pharmaceuticals consist of drug
bearing spheroids, generally about 0.8 to 1.2 mm in
diameter, contained in capsules or compressed into tablets.
By using a combination of spheroids having different
drug release characteristics, a dosage form can
be tailored to provide the desired drug
