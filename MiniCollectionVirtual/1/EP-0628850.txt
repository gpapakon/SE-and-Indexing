<ABSTRACT>
A camera is disclosed which includes a loading 
chamber for receiving a film cartridge. A groove (20) in the 

film cartridge is engaged by a retention member (28) during 
movement of the film cartridge from the loading chamber. 

The retention member (28) allows the film cartridge (10) to move 
partially out of the loading chamber but prevents the 

film cartridge from completely moving out of the loading 
chamber. The retention member (28) is capable of being 

disabled to allow the film cartridge to be completely 
moved out of the loading chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field
of photography, and, more particularly, to apparatus
associated with controlling the movement of a film
cartridge from a loading chamber in a camera.In conventional cameras, a film cartridge is
loaded into a loading chamber. Film in the film
cartridge is manually or automatically loaded into the
camera. Images are then recorded on the film afterwhich
the film is rewound into the film cartridge. A door
covering the loading chamber is opened and the film
cartridge is removed so that the film can be processed.In older 35mm cameras, the film cartridge is
loaded into the loading chamber in a direction
perpendicular to the cartridge spool. More recently,
cameras have been developed in which the film cartridge
is loaded in a direction parallel to the cartridge spool
or end first. Such a camera is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 5,155,514 which issued in the name of Tamamura on
October 13, 1992.In the Tamamura reference; a film cartridge 1
is pushed down into a loading chamber 12. By pushing the
cartridge into the chamber, an end 1a of the cartridge
contacts a sloped face 7a of a lock lever 7, causing the
lock lever to be moved to the right. The cartridge is
pushed into the chamber against a spring 11. Once the
cartridge is completely in the chamber, a spring 9 forces
lock lever 7 to the left, thereby retaining the cartridge
in the chamber against the force of spring 11. A cover
member 6 is then moved to the left to cover the loading
chamber. When it is desired to remove the film from the
loading chamber, cover member 6 is moved to the right
against a spring 8. The movement of cover member 6
causes lock lever 7 to move to the right against a spring
9. When the lock lever is moved far enough to the right,
portion 7d of the lock lever disengages the upper surface
of the cartridge, allowing the cartridge to move out of
the loading chamber under the influence of spring 11.US-A-5,142,316 discloses a camera comprising a loading
chamber for taking in or out a film cartridge endwise, and a
leaf spring mounted in the loading chamber for urging the
film cartridge inserted into the film chamber toward the
direction perpendicular to the axis of the film cartridge
movement against an inner wall of the loading chamber, which
prevents the film cartridge from falling out of the loading
chamber when the opened loading chamber is inclined or in an
upside-down position, and which is capable of being disabled
to allow the film cartridge to be completely moved out of the
loading chamber.A

<CLAIMS>
A camera (24), comprising:

a loading chamber (25) for receiving and storing a film
cartridge (10) in a predetermined position; and
means (20,23;28,32) for engaging the film cartridge
during movement of the film cartridge from the loading

chamber, and for allowing the film cartridge to move
partially out of the loading chamber but preventing the

film cartridge from completely moving out of the loading
chamber, and which is capable of being disabled to allow

the film cartridge to be completely moved out of the
loading chamber; 
characterized in that
 said engaging
means includes a spring loaded member (28) having

oppositely inclined surfaces (28a,28b) which are shaped so as to be
extendible into a groove (20) located on the external surface of the housing (12) of the film

cartridge (10), wherein said inclined surface (28b)
contacts a portion (23) of the film cartridge at one end

of the groove to thereby prevent the film cartridge from
moving completely out of the loading chamber during unloading of the film cartridge from the camera.
The camera of claim 1, further comprising:

moving means (26,34,42,52,60,68) for moving the film cartridge
(10) out from the loading chamber (25).
The camera of claim 2, further comprising:

a door (26) for covering an entrance to said loading
chamber, said door including a surface (26a) which

engages a surface of a portion (52a) of said moving
means, at least one of said moving means' surface and

door surface having a cam profile which permits said
door to be substantially opened before said moving means

starts to move said film cartridge from said loading
chamber such that said film cartridge does not contact

said door.
The camera of claim 2, further comprising:

a door (26) for covering an entrance to said loading
chamber, said door engaging said moving means, said door 

and said moving means being configured such that
when said door is in an open position, the insertion of

said film cartridge completely into said loading chamber
will not move the open door.
The camera of claim 2, wherein said
loading chamber is formed to receive and discharge the

film cartridge end first.
The camera of claim 2, wherein said moving
means applies no force for urging said film cartridge

out of said loading chamber prior to moving said film
cartridge out of said loading chamber.
Apparatus for taking pictures, comprising:

a film cartridge (10);
a camera (24) having a Loading chamber (25) for
receiving and storing the film cartridge in a predetermined position; and
means (20,23;28,32) on the camera and the film
cartridge, which engage each other during movement of the film

cartridge from the loading chamber, for allowing the
film cartridge to move partially out of the loading

chamber without allowing the film cartridge to be
completely moved out of the loading chamber, said

means being capable of being disabled to allow
the film cartridge to be completely moved out of the

loading chamber; 
characterized in that
 said
means includes a spring loaded member (28) in the camera having

oppositely inclined surfaces (28a,28b) which are shaped so as to be
extendible into a groove (20) located on the external surface of the housing (12) of the film

cartridge (10), wherein said inclined surface (28b)
contacts a portion (23) of the film cartridge at one end

of the groove to thereby prevent the film cartridge from
moving completely out of the loading chamber during unloading of the film cartridge from the camera.
