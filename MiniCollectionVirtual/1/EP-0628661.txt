<ABSTRACT>
In a roadfinisher (F) having electric drives for functional components, a primary drive unit (13, 14; 15) for the drives which is formed from an internal combustion engine and three-phase generator, and a chassis (1) possessing running gear (2, 2'), on which chassis there are provided, in the working direction of travel, at the front a material container (9) and at the rear a transverse distribution device (7), between which the primary drive unit and a driver's cab (11) are arranged on the chassis (1), the primary drive unit (13, 14; 15) forms an independent structural unit (B, B') which is arranged, in the working direction of travel (A), behind the driver's cab (11) and so as to be detachable from the chassis (1).

<CLAIMS>
A road finisher (F) comprising electric drive means for
functional components, a primary drive assembly (13, 14)

used for said electric drive means (4, 6, 10, 19, 20, 33)
and consisting of an internal combustion engine (13) and a

three-phase generator (14), and a chassis (1) which is provided
with a travelling mechanism (2, 2') and which has attached

thereto a receptacle (9) for the road-surface material
at the front and a transverse distribution means (7) at

the rear when seen in the direction (A) in which the road
finisher moves during operation, the primary drive assembly

(13, 14) and a driver's stand (11) being arranged on the
chassis (1) between said receptacle (9) for the road-surface

material and said transverse distribution means (7), said
primary drive assembly (13, 14) being electrically connected

to frequency converters (15) for said drive means (4, 6, 10,
19, 20, 33), 
characterized in that
 the primary drive assembly
(13, 14) constitutes an independent structural unit (B')

which is arranged such that it is removable and located
behind the driver's stand (11) when seen in the direction

(A) in which the road finisher moves during operation, and
that the frequency converters (15) are incorporated in the

structural unit (B') and connected to the drive means via
releasable connectors.
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the driver's stand (11) is provided in a closed
driver's cabin (12) at the front end of the chassis (1)

bordering on the receptacle (9) for the road-surface material.
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the frequency converters (15) are arranged behind or at
the side of the primary drive assembly (13, 14) on the chassis

(1) and are electrically connected to the drive means
which are implemented as asynchronous motors.
A road finisher according to claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the frequency converters (15) are connected to the primary
drive assembly (13, 14) via a releasable connecting

means (28) and that they are attached to the chassis (1).
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the chassis (1) and the structural unit (B') have
provided thereon releasable fastening members (25, 26)

which are adapted to be brought into interengagement.
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the primary drive assembly (13, 14) in the structural
unit (B') is arranged transversely to the direction (A) in

which the road finisher moves during operation, said primary
drive assembly being preferably arranged such that the

crankshaft axis of the internal combustion engine (13) and
the axis of the three-phase generator (14) extend transversely.
A road finisher according to at least one of the claims 1
to 6, 
characterized in that
 the primary drive assembly (13,
14) in the structural unit (B') is enclosed by capsule-type

housing (16) which is preferably removable or dismountable.
A road finisher according to at least one of the claims 1
to 7, 
characterized in that
 the fuel tank and a starter battery
of the internal combustion engine (13) are included in

the structural unit (B').
A road finisher according to at least one of the claims 1
to 8, 
characterized in that
, instead of the removed structural
unit (B'), a cable drum (30) is adapted to be attached 

to and secured in position on the chassis (1), said cable
drum (30) being provided with a supply cable (31) for the

electric drive means, which is adapted to be unwound there
from and connected to the frequency converters (15).
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the structural unit (B') is implemented as an independent
three-phase supply unit which is adapted to be operated

separately from the road finisher.
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the structural unit (B') is provided with connection
members (23, 24) for a lifting device.
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the driver's cab (12) has provided therein control and
supervision means for the primary drive assembly (13, 14),

said control and supervision means being separably (35) connected
to the primary drive assembly (13, 14).
A road finisher according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the driver's cab (12) is attached to the chassis (1)
such that it is adapted to be raised or tilted.
