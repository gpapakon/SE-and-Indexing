A method to improve the radio cell coverage in a
cellular mobile radio system, in which a number of

adjacent and adjoining cells (20-26) form a cluster (10,
13), in which at least one fixed station (1) with at least

one sector antenna is arranged in the marginal area of
each cell (20), and in which the transmissions of a mobile

station (34) are received by the fixed station (1) of the
cell (20) in which the mobile station (34) is located and

by the fixed stations (2, 3) of the adjoining cells,

characterised in that
 each sector antenna sweeps at least
the area of the cell (20) with radio frequencies of a

channel group, the fixed stations (2, 3) of adjacent cells
(21, 23) immediately adjoining a cell (20) transmitting

into this cell (20) with the same channel group as the
fixed station (1) of the cell (20) to be covered, and 
in
that
 each channel in each fixed station (1, 2, 3)
transmits with an individual, adjustable output, the

output of each fixed station (1, 2, 3) on this channel
being set in proportion to the share of the transmission

output of this fixed station (1, 2, 3) at the receiver
input of the mobile station (34), and 
in that
 a balancing
of the transmission outputs between the fixed stations (1,

2, 3) takes place such that the fixed stations which are
nearest to the mobile station (34) transmit with a portion

of their output, whilst the fixed stations which farther
away from the mobile station (34) transmit with a smaller

portion of their output or are completely switched off.
A method to improve the radio cell coverage in a
cellular mobile radio system, in which a number of

each cell (20),

be covered, and 
in that

(1, 2, 3) transmits with an individual, adjustable outpu
t,

in
that
 a balancing of the transmission outputs between these
fixed stations (1, 2, 3) takes place such that the fixed
