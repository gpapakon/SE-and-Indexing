<ABSTRACT>
A switched reluctance motor controller derives an 
error signal from the difference between a phase winding 

current reference and the phase winding current. The 
error signal is applied to a pair of hysteresis circuits 

which define adjacent hysteresis bands above and below 
the reference current. The outputs of the hysteresis 

circuits are received by control logic which permits 
current to be applied to the phase winding when the 

current is below the hysteresis bands, removes current 
from the phase winding when the current is above the 

hysteresis bands and allows the phase winding current to 
freewheel when the current is between the upper and lower 

hysteresis limits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a controller for a variable 
inductive load, the controller comprising: means for 
deriving an error signal which is the difference between 
a reference signal indicative of a reference current and 
a feedback signal indicative of a load current; switch 
means which are actuatable into a freewheel arrangement 
in which current recirculates through the load; and 
switch control means for closing the switch means when 
the load current is below a lower current bound below the 
reference current, for opening the switch means when the 
load current is above an upper current bound above the 
reference current, and for actuating the freewheel 
arrangement of the switch means when the load current 
reaches the reference current level from below the lower 
current bound. A switched reluctance motor is an example of an 
electrical load in which the inductance is not constant 
with time or machine operation, i.e. rotor angle. 
Figure 1(a) illustrates a typical three-phase switched 
reluctance (SR) machine and Figures 1(b) and (c) 
illustrate well-known examples of electronic switching 
circuits which may be used to control an SR machine. The 
SR machine essentially consists of a stator s defining 
stator poles 1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3' on which are wound phase 
windings w, of which only one is shown in association 
with a set of poles 2, 2'. The machine also has a rotor 
r with salient poles 4, 4' and 5, 5'. The electronic 
circuits are arranged to supply unidirectional currents 
to the phase windings w. In the control circuits of Figures 1(b) and (c), each 
phase winding of the machine in Figure 1(a) is associated 
with a circuit leg comprising at least one electronic  
 
switch t in series with each winding across a dc supply 
Vs. A general treatment of the principles of SR machines 
is given in the paper 'The Characteristics, Design and 
Applications of Switched Reluctance Motors and Drives' by 
Stephenson et al. presented at PCIM'93 Conference and 
Exhibition at Nurnberg, Germany, June 21st-24th 1993. Proposed means for controlling an SR machine to run at 
different speeds include operation in three 
characteristic regions which can be designated as 'low-speed', 
'medium-speed' and 'high-speed' regions. For 
background and explanation on this see 'Variable-Speed  
 
Switched Reluctance Motors' by Lawrenson et al. IEE 
Proceedings Part B, Vol.127, No.4, July 1980. In the low-speed 
region the current is controlled by the well-known 
method of 'chopping'. The present invention relates to
