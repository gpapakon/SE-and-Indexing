<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to synthetic
lubricant compositions and/or functional fluids and more
specifically to low temperature synthetic oil compositions
wherein the base oil contains a 1-decene dimer which is
prepared using a BF3-water catalyst complex.Alpha-olefin oligomers and their use as synthetic
lubricants ("synlubes") are well-known. The oligomers are
usually hydrogenated in order to improve their stability.
Early reports of such synlubes are in Seger et al. U.S.
2,500,161 and Garwood U.S. 2,500,163. The particular
applications for which such oligomer oils are used depends
upon their viscosity, with viscosities of 2 to 10 mm2/s at
100°C being preferred for general lubricating oil applications.
Low viscosity, (e.g. 1 to 3 mm2/s at 100°C) alpha-olefin
dimer oils are especially useful in heat transfer,
insulating, hydraulic and low temperature lubricant applications.
Commercially available hydrogenated dimers prepared,
for example, by oligomerizing 1-decene using a BF3-butanol, or
BF3-propanol catalyst become cloudy and exhibit significant
viscosity changes at -54°C. Such dimers fail to meet pour
point and low temperature viscosity specifications for
certain military uses due to the presence of relatively large
amounts of linear isomers.U.S. patent 5,068,487 discloses a dimerization
process using BF3-alcohol alkoxylate promoters which produces
dimers having excellent very low temperature properties and,
especially the -54°C viscosity and the pour point, as
described in U. S. patent 5,171,905. These dimers have
improved very low temperature properties because they contain
reduced amounts of the relatively linear isomers which are
present in the BF3-alkylalcohol produced dimers. U.S. patent 3,763,244 describes a process for
producing alpha-olefin oligomers having low pour points which
process uses a BF3-water complex. The dimer produced using
BF3-water complex catalysts is indicated to be the cause of
high pour points. The process uses excess BF3 in order to
keep the amount of dimer in the oligomer product to below 10%
so that the usual distillation step to remove excess dimer
can be eliminated. Example 2, which does not use excess BF3,
produces 18.5% dimer or "a large amount of undesirable
dimer". Examples 3 and 4 which use excess BF3 produce only
6.5 and 2.6 percent dimer, e.g., less than 10% dimer, and the
products are reported to have a low pour point without the
need to remove dimer. I have now found that the dimer produced
using a BF3-water complex catalyst at temperatures of
from 25°

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 1-decene oligomers using a boron trifluoride-water complex
catalyst for the oligomerization which comprises (a) continuously feeding water in cocatalytic

amounts (0.01 to 10 grams per 100 grams of monomer) to the oligomerization
reaction mixture as the reaction proceeds while maintaining the reaction mixture at a

temperature of from 25° to 50°C under a pressurized atmosphere of boron trifluoride, (b)
discontinuing the reaction when the content of 1-decence dimeric oligomers in the

oligomerization product is from 12 to 25 weight percent, and (c) distilling the
oligomerization product to separate 1-decene dimeric oligomers from higher 1-decene

oligomers.

separated 1-decene dimeric oligomers.
The 1-decene dimeric oligomers produced according to the process of Claim 1 or
Claim 2 having a kinematic viscosity of less than 250 mm

/s at -40°C, a kinematic viscosity
of less than 1000 mm
2
/s at -54°C and a pour point of less than -65°C.
The use of the hydrogenated 1-decene dimeric oligomers of Claims 2 and 3 as a base
oil for use in a low temperature lubricant or functional fluid.
