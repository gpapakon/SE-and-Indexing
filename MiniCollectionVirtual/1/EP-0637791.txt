A sealing strip for an aperture in a sliding control with a fixing 
strip serving to fix it to a housing of a sliding control which is fitted with a 

soft, elastic sealing lip for the aperture, characterised in that the sealing lip 
(11) is form-fitted to the fixing strip (10) and forms a pre-fabricated modular 

unit with it, and that the fixing strip is made of a material which is different 
to the material of the sealing lip and which is harder than the material of the 

sealing lip. 
A sealing strip in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that 
the fixing strip (10) is made of a fibre-reinforced plastic. 
A sealing strip in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the sealing lip (11) is integrally moulded to the fixing strip (10). 
A sealing strip in accordance with claim 3, characterised in that 
the fixing strip (10) has a ridge (13) with openings (14) to which the sealing 

lip (11) is integrally moulded in such a way that on one side of the ridge there 
is a foot strip (20) for the sealing lip (11) which is connected by means of 

connecting pins (22) passing through the openings (14) to another strip (21) 
which is integrally moulded to the opposite side of the ridge (13). 
A sealing strip in accordance with claim 4, characterised in that 
an approximately undulating band (18) is connected to the side of the foot strip 

(20) facing away from the ridge (13).  
 
A sealing strip in accordance with one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the fixing strip (10) is designed as a U-shaped frame 

which frames one longitudinal side and both ends of the sealing lip (11). 
A sealing strip in accordance with claim 6, characterised in that 
the height of the limbs (15, 16) of the frame is at least approximately the same 

as the height of the sealing lip (11). 
A sealing strip in accordance with claim 6 or 7, characterised 
in that the limbs (15, 16) of the frame are fitted with mounting devices (17).
