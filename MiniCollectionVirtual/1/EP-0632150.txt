<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for the texturing of continuous filament threads (1) has, in a crimping part (8), drop wires (10) having at their two ends extensions (15 and 15a) which are provided point-symmetrically to one another, but offset, and which are rounded on the end faces (39 and 40). This point-symmetrical shape affords the possibility of rotating the drop wires (10) after the wear of one end face (for example, 39) and of turning the end face (40) inwards. The advantage lies in the doubling of useful life of a drop wire.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for texturizing endless filament 
yarns by means of heated flowing media, with a 

thread insertion portion (2) for sucking in the 
yarns, a treatment portion (4) situated downstream 

thereof with a treatment chamber (7) for heating 
the yarns, and with a crimping portion (8) being 

downstream of the treatment portion (4) and comprising 
a so-called slot nozzle and in which the 

heated yarns are crimped for the formation of a 
crimping in the yarns, with the slot nozzle being 

provided with lamellae (10) resulting in the slots 
which have a substantially rectangular cross section 

and are arranged with one of their narrow 
sides facing the crimped yarn in a ray-shaped manner, 

with each lamella being a flat steel part, 
characterized in that the ends of the lamellae are 

each provided with an extension (15, 15a) which 
has a smaller width (B) than the width (B.1) of 

the lamella, with the one extension (15) being adjacent 
without any transition to the one face side 

(40) and the other extension (15a) to the other 
face side (39) of the lamella. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that each extension has the same length (L) and 

the same width (B). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that each end of the lamella is provided, in 

addition to the extension and between the extension 
and on the narrow side opposite of the exension, 

with a chamfer (41) which encloses with the 
narrow side adjacent thereto an angle (α) with a 

predetermined angular range.  
 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the angle (α) lies in an angular range between 

120° and 150°. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the face sides of the lamellae (39, 40) 

are rounded off and polished. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the rounded face side is provided in the 

maximum with a coefficent of roughness (Ra) of 0.4 
µ, preferably 0.2 µ. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the rounded face side is provided with a 

radius which substantially corresponds to half the 
thickness of the lamella.
