<ABSTRACT>
A cellulose mixture including a protein based adhesive binder and colorant. The mixture can be compression molded or extruded and upon curing in the presence of microwave or radio frequency energy or in a thermally controlled appliance, produces board or shape formed stock. The produced stock exhibits colorations and a grain pattern comparable to natural stone. Unlike stone, the material exhibits a light weight, low density, structural rigidity and ready machinability. A preferred method includes admixing separate, colorized batches of feedstock, each feedstock includes shredded waste newsprint, soybean flour, water and a colorant; reducing the moisture content of each feedstock or a proportioned admixture of several feedstocks, such as by air drying or compressing or performing the admixture in the presence of heat; compacting the admixture to final shape; and curing the shaped material. Final forming and finishing apparatus complete the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to byproducts of
recycled paper and, in particular, to a molded stock
formed from one or more relatively dry, colorized batches
of admixture ingredient. Each batch ingredient includes
a soybean derived adhesive binder, a separate colorant
and other additives. Predetermined concentrations of the
batch ingredients are combined and cured under pressure
in the presence of microwave, radio frequency or thermal
energy.With growing concerns and pressures to find
alternative uses for waste matter, various efforts have
been directed to developing conversion processes for
deriving usable products from recycled newsprint and
other paper stocks. The majority of these efforts have
been directed to producing building insulation materials
in shredded form and in molded sheet form. Such sheet
goods can comprise recycled paper or relatively more
dense or thicker materials such as construction grade
panel board or liana board. These processes may include
the addition of various adhesives and additives, molding
and curing steps.Processes directed to the production of insulation
materials can be found upon directing attention to U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,184,311 and 4,300,322. The former patent
discloses a molded insulation product laminated to an 
outer covering. The latter discloses a dry shredded
mixture which is injected into a batting envelope and
which envelope can be mounted in conventional fashion.
Sprayed processes also exist in which shredded newsprint
particulate is mixed with water and sprayed into
structural spaces, where the material hardens, after
skimming away excess material. Australian application
Serial No. 36603/84 entitled Improved Insulation Product
also discloses a molded newsprint insulation. The
material is principally air cured, although reference is
made to microwave curing.U.S. Patent No. 4,148,952 discloses a process for
partially shredding and consolidating waste paper to
facilitate transport. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,111,730 and
5,011,741, otherwise, disclose processes wherein a binder
derived from a cooked starch and urea formaldehyde resin
are added to slurries which are molded under pressure and
cured to form uncolored board stocks. The former may
also be used as a structural building member.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,994,148 and 5,064,504 also
disclose methods for creating molded structural blocks
from a newsprint slurry which is formed in a screen wall
molding chamber. A plaster or cement binder is also
disclosed. Curing of the blocks is effected through air
drying.Various

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing a pressure-formed article
characterized in that the method comprises:


(a) preparing an adhesive binder having a Ph of
between 10-13 from a legume derivative and water;

wherein the adhesive binder includes a colorant;
(b) blending the adhesive binder with shredded
cellulosic material to form a semidry flocculent

feedstock;
(c) reducing the moisture content of the semidry
flocculent feedstock;
(d) combining at least two differently colored
batches of semidry flocculent feedstock; and
(e) pressing the flocculent feedstock having a
reduced moisture content at a temperature and

pressure effective to form an article having a stone
like granular appearance.
The method of claim 1 wherein the cellulosic material
is newsprint.
The method of claims 1 or 2 wherein the legume
derivative is a pulse crop derivative.
The method of claim 3 wherein the pulse crop
derivative is a soybean derivative.
The method of claim 3 wherein the pulse crop
derivative is soybean meal.
The method of any of claims 1-5 wherein the step of
combining at least two differently colored batches of

semidry flocculent feedstock occurs prior to the step
of reducing the moisture content of the semidry

flocculent feedstock.

is a metal oxide colorant.
The method of claim 7 wherein the metal oxide colorant
is an iron oxide colorant.
