<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for a chair, suitable for a person with a stiff hip, or other handicap, and includes a seat (1) having two flaps at its front portion (2), these flaps (3; 4) being angularly adjustable relative to the general plane of the seat. With the aid of an accessible control means (5) a drive means (6) is actuated such as to be automatically, infinitely variably adjustable from/to a bottommost, lowered position (A) of the flap (3; 4) forming a negative angle to the general plane of the seat (1) to/from an uppermost, raised position (B) of the flap (3; 4) forming a positive angle to the general plane of the seat (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
chair, preferably of the type that is both adaptable and 
versatile, such as to be suitable for a person with a stiff 
hip, or other disability. The chair includes a seat, having 
two flaps at its front portion, these being angularly 
adjustable as required, in relation to the general plane of 
the seat being adjustable as desired, with the aid of a 
drive means actuated by a control means mounted on an edge 
portion of the chair seat, the respective flap is variably 
adjustable from/to a bottommost, lowered position of the 
flap forming a negative angle relative to the general plane 
of the seat, and to/from an uppermost, raised position (B) 
of the flap forming a positive angle to said seat plane. Chairs already known in the art, intended for persons 
handicapped with hip and/or leg stiffness, have a seat 
which may be divided into either two or three parts, which 
are adjustable in relation to each other for obtaining the 
best sitting comfort, which can be seen from e.g. 
US-A-3 446 532 and DE-A-800 488. These different movable 
parts are mounted on the chair frame with the aid of hinges, 
and are provided with latching means for keeping them 
in desired positions. There is further known from 
FR-A-2 164 162 a chair construction having a back being 
adjustable by a thumbwheel connected to an adjusting screw 
via a wire. It has now been found that this type of seat 
constructions are not entirely satisfactory, since the seat 
is difficult to adjust, both by the disabled person and by 
any attendant who could presumably be available. For the 
disabled person it is very important that the seat gives 
sufficient support to a stiff leg and/or hip at an exact 
height of the respective movable and adjustable seat part. 
The greatest problem here is that of latching the movable  
 
parts. This is most often accomplished with the aid of a 
thumbwheel equipped with a latching pin, the thumbwheel 
being turned anticlockwise when adjustment is to take 
place, thus allowing the respective movable seat part to be 
moved by hand to a desired position, whereafter the thumbwheel 
is turned clockwise, thereon causing the latching pin 
to come into engagement with an adjusting rod, which projects 
out from, and is situated under, the adjustable seat 
part. It is difficult for a disabled person to use sufficient 
force to turn the thumbwheel such as to latch the 
respective adjustable seat part. If the thumbwheel is 
tightened too lightly, the set position of the seat part 
will

<CLAIMS>
A chair, preferably of the type adapted 
for a person with a handicap, the chair including a seat 

(1) having two flaps (3, 4) at its front portion (2), the 
angular relationship of these flaps to the general plane of 

the seat being adjustable as desired with the aid of a 
drive means (6) actuated by a control means (5) mounted at 

an edge portion of the chair seat, the respective flap (3; 
4) is variably adjustable from/to a bottommost, lowered 

position (A) of the flap (3; 4) forming a negative angle 
relative to the general plane of the seat (1), and to/from 

an uppermost, raised position (B) of the flap (3; 4) forming 
a positive angle to said seat plane, wherein the seat 

(1) includes a base plate (7) having two flap elements (9, 
10) pivotably mounted at the front edge (8) thereof, there 

also being a seat pad (26) mounted on the base plate and 
its flap elements (9, 10) via support plates (11-13), said 

pad having flap-like formations (14, 15) at its front 
portion (2), said formations being inseparably formed 

together with the seat pad (26) to provide an integrated 
seat, and said drive means (6) comprises a piston (17) 

reciprocably movable out of, and into a drive cylinder 
(16), the outer end (18) of the piston being pivotably 

attached to a link (19), which in turn is pivotably attached 
at its other end to a guide pin (20) rigidly attached 

to, and projecting downwards from the underside of the 
respective flap element (9, 10), said piston being infinitely 

variably movable to different, selected, fixed positions 
in its direction of movement via the drive cylinder 

(16) under actuation of the control means (5). 
A chair as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that the drive cylinder (16) includes an internal thread 

for coaction with a mating, complemental thread on the  
 

piston (17), such that on turning the drive cylinder (16) 
in its supporting bearing blocks (21, 22) relative to the 

piston (17), the latter is moved either into, or out from 
the cylinder (16) while simultaneously affecting the angular 

attitude of the respective flap element (9; 10) in 
relation to the base plate (7). 
A chair as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in
 that the control means (5) comprises 
a thumbwheel (23) mounted for rotation in a holder 

(24), and connected to the drive cylinder (16) by a cable 
or wire (25) for translating the rotational movement of the 

thumbwheel (23) to the drive cylinder (16). 
A chair as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that the respective flap (3; 4) projects out from the front 

portion (2) of the seat (1) a distance which is substantially 
one-third of the total depth of the seat (1).
