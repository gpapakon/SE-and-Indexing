<ABSTRACT>
A carbonaceous product (12), e.g. containing anthracites fines, is supplied to a mixer (15) in which it is mixed with a dispersing or deflocculating agent, a fibre material in fine fibrous form, and water; the resultant mixture is fed to a pelletiser (16) and a drier (17). The dispersing or deflocculating agent is a lignosulphate, and the fibre material comprises paper, especially waste paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Solid FuelThe present invention relates to a solid fuel, for example a reactive fuel which is equivalent to charcoal, and to a method of manufacture thereof.Millions of tons of hardwood trees are felled each year for the production of charcoal. The method of production involves carbonisation of the wood to drive off tars and resins which creates enormous pollution problems in the form of smoke into the atmosphere. It takes five tons of hardwood to make one ton of charcoal. The charcoal is predominantly used for cooking and heating in third world countries, but also as a leisure activity in the developed countries. Therefore the pressures on the rain forests in these regions is an ongoing problem due to population growth, which must inevitably have an impact on the rain forests and therefore the environment globally.Depleting the rain forests leads to climatical changes, soil erosion and the silting up of rivers, all of which have contributed to major disasters in the past.There are already known various charcoal substitutes generally known as charcoal or barbecue briquettes. However these fuels suffer from one or more disadvantages. For example, most charcoal or barbecue briquettes contain charcoal and are therefore also contributing to the depletion of the rain forest.Some known charcoal substitutes contain significant amounts of binders, and possibly also chemical lighting agents. These binders and lighting aids create gases 

 and smoke which contaminate food and the vicinity of the cooking or heating appliance. Commonly used binders in conventional charcoal and barbecue briquettes are starches, which because of the sugar content of such binders make the fuel prone to biodegradation, leading to fungal growth, and causing a lot of smoke during ignition and burning.Other known charcoal substitutes containing or not containing charcoal, are produced by making use c- a carbonisation process, which is just as polluting as the production of charcoal itself.The present invention seeks to overcome or reduce one or more of the above disadvantages.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a solid fuel comprising a mixture of particles of at least one carbonaceous product, a dispersing or deflocculating agent, and a fibre material in fine fibrous form.An advantage of the above fuel is that it has excellent combustion properties. It is believed that the dispersing or deflocculating agent serves to expand the fuel product to separate the carbonaceous particles, while the individual

Claims
1. A solid fuel comprising a mixture of particles of at least one carbonaceous product (12), a dispersing or deflocculating agent, and a fibre material in fine fibrous form.
2. A solid fuel according to claim 1, wherein the carbonaceous product (12) comprises anthracite fires.
3. A solid fuel according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the carbonaceous product (12) comprises a fine coal product comprising semi-anthracite steam coal, bituminous coal, brown coal, coke, petroleum coke, charcoal and/or ligmite.
4. A solid fuel according to any preceding claim wherein the dispersing or deflocculating agent comprises a lignosulphonate.
5. A solid fuel according to any preceding Claim wherein the fibre material comprises paper in fine fibrous form.
6. A solid fuel according to any preceding claim wherein the fibre material comprises, in fine fibrous form cardboard, carton, sawdust, wood shavings, bagasse straw, peat cotton, man-made fibres, natural cellulosic material, metal and/or ceramic material.
7. A method of manufacturing a solid fuel comprising mixing particles of at least one carbonaceous product (12), a dispersing or deflocculating agent, a fibre material in fine fibrous form, and a liquid, forming the mixture into a pellet and drying the pellet to 


 remove at least a substantial part of the liquid.
8. A method according to claim 7, wherein, during mixing, said particles abrade said fibre material into its fine fibrous form.
9. A method according to claim 7 or 8 wherein, before mixing, said fibre material is subjected to a shredding, pulping or other process for reducing it, at least partially, to its fine fibrous form.
10. Apparatus for manufacturing a solid fuel comprising means (11,14) supplying particles of at least one carbonaceous product (12) to a mixer (15) which also receives a dispersing or deflocculating agent, a fibre material in fine fibrous form, and a liquid, means (16) connected to the outlet of the mixer (15) for forming the mixture into pellets, and drying means (17) connected to the outlet of the pelletising means (16) for supplying dried pellets (18).
