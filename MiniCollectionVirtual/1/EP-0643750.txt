<ABSTRACT>
A coating composition suitable as an undercoating for cars contains vinyl-chloride-polymer-based plastisol and expandable thermoplastic microspheres. The expandable thermoplastic microspheres have a substantially halogen-free polymer shell which comprises a copolymer of halogen-free monomers and, in an amount of at least about 80 % by weight, nitrile-containing monomers. Preferably, the polymer shell of the thermoplastic microspheres contains from about 85 % by weight to about 97 % by weight of nitrile-containing monomer. A method for spray-coating a surface with the coating composition by airless spraying is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new coating composition based on vinyl-chloride-polymer plastisol and containing
thermoplastic microspheres as filler. More specifically, the invention concerns a coating composition which is especially
suitable as an undercoating for cars. The composition contains expandable thermoplastic microspheres having
a polymer shell which is substantially halogen-free and is based on nitrile-containing monomers and halogen-free
monomers. The invention also relates to a method for spray-coating, as well as the use of the coating composition.To provide protection against rust and impacts from stones, it is known to treat the chassis and other exposed car
components with coating compositions. Conventional coating compositions usually are bituminous compounds or plastisolbased
coating compositions. As is also known, polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) plastisols of improved stone resistance
and reduced weight can be obtained by using thermoplastic microspheres as filler in the plastisol composition (see,
for instance, DE 40 18 022 and JP 85-281981).When employed as coating compositions for cars, plastisols are gelatinised in the furnaces used for hardening or
drying car paint. Usually, a car body is subjected to several painting and drying operations.When used as an undercoating for cars, the PVC plastisol is applied by airless spraying. This method effectively
spreads the high-viscosity plastisol, but requires very high pressures. Thus, pressures of up to 200 bar are not uncommon.
In addition, the spraying systems are dimensioned to keep the high pressure constant for fairly long periods of
time, e.g. 200 bar for 3 h. It has, however, been found that expanded low-density microspheres, which are used in the
above patent specifications, do not retain this density when subjected to high pressure over long periods of time. To
improve the pressure resistance of the microsphere-filled plastisol, it has been suggested to use unexpanded microspheres.
These are caused to expand when the plastisol is gelatinised, which results in a so-called foamed PVC
plastisol of homogeneous cellular structure, exhibiting the aimed-at low weight and improved resistance to stone impacts.
It has however been found that the microspheres collapse when the foamed plastisol is heated to normal gelatinisation
temperatures (100-180Â°C). The conventional microspheres used in the plastisol are thus unable to withstand
the high temperatures. As a result, the expanding agents of the spheres are released, resulting in a
