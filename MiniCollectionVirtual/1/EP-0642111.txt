<ABSTRACT>
An information sign comprises a mounting device, a base plate with parallel, continuous, recessed information lines (information rows) for receiving information elements, an interchangeable (replaceable) top film and a transparent cover plate. This information sign is designed such that the base plate has the maximum number of information lines needed, that the interchangeable top film has the number of transparent information lines which is desired in each case and which is geared to the specific application, which information lines are in each case arranged congruently with at least one information line of the base plate, and that the number of information lines of various, interchangeable top films can be selected to be different from top film to top film for various signs, whereas the number of information lines of the base plate and thus the base plate itself remains unchanged. An interchangeable grid film (screen film) can be superposed on the interchangeable top film.

<CLAIMS>
Information sign fixable to a wall or reception surface, comprising 

an assembly device (1), 
a base plate (2) with a viewing surface, which has parallel, channel-like 
depressed information lines of the same height (7-11) extending from one 

side to the facing side, the information lines being separated from one 
another by raised empty lines (12-15) having the same spacing and are constructed 

for receiving information strips or information elements with 
letters, figures, information pictograms, etc., 
a replaceable cover film (4) having transparent lines and whose external 
dimensions correspond to the dimensions of the viewing surface of the base 

plate, each transparent line being arranged congruently to in each case one 
information line and 
a transparent cover plate (3), 
 
characterized in that
 
the base plate (2) has a maximum required number of information lines and 

the replaceable cover film (4) has a desired number of transparent lines 
matched to the specific application, said desired number being smaller than 

the maximum required number. 
Information sign according to claim 1, characterized in that the cover 
film (4) is transparent and has on its surface, with the exception of the 

transparent lines, a colour coating. 
Information sign according to claim 2, characterized in that the colour 
coating is constructed as fine screens. 
Information sign according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that at least one replaceable screen film (5) superimposing the replaceable 

cover film (4) is provided. 
Information sign according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that two screen films (5, 5) with different colouring are superimposed, so 

that a different colour appears on the viewing surface. 
System for information signs fixable to a wall or reception surface, 
each information sign comprising  

 

an assembly device (1), 
a base plate (2) with a viewing surface, which has parallel, channel-like 
depressed information lines of the same height (7-11) extending from one 

side to the facing side, the information lines being separated from one 
another by raising empty lines (12-15) having the same spacing and are constructed 

for receiving information strips or information elements with 
letters, figures, information pictograms, etc., 
a replaceable cover film (4) having transparent lines and whose external 
dimensions correspond to the dimensions of the viewing surface of the base 

plate, each transparent line being arranged congruently to in each case one 
information line and 
a transparent cover plate (3), 
 
characterized in that the system comprises 


several base plates, all of which are identical and each base plate has a 
maximum required number of information lines (7-11), 
and a plurality of cover films, which in each case have a desired number of 
transparent lines matched to the specific application, the desired number 

being the same or smaller than the maximum required number, so that for 
different information signs in each case a different cover film can be 

chosen. 
System for information signs according to claim 6, characterized in that 
different cover films (4) can be interchangeably placed on the same base 

plate. 
System for information signs according to one of the claims 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the cover films (4) are transparent and have on their 

surface, with the exception of the transparent lines, a colour coating. 
System for information signs according to claim 8, characterized in that 
the colour coating is constructed as fine screens. 
System for information signs according to one of the claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that there is at least one replaceable screen film (5) 

superimposing the replaceable cover film (4).  
 
System for information signs according to one of the claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that there are several screen films (5, 5) with different 

colouring, which can be superimposed, so that another colour appears on the 
viewing surface.
