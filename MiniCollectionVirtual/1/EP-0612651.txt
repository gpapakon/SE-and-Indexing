<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain a compact actuator which is easy to produce and nevertheless operationally reliable and has spindle drive, the rotor of a driving electric motor is constructed as a hollow shaft (3) which receives permanent magnets (3.1; 3.2) on its outer circumference and into which a spindle nut (5) is bonded, without form fit, concentrically within the rotor space, which spindle nut (5) engages over an adjustment rod (4) with a spindle component (4.1) and drives it in an axially displaceable fashion by means of ball rollers (4.2); the hollow shaft (3) is mounted in an axially pretensioned fashion axially on both sides in the housing of the actuator by means of angular contact ball bearings (6; 7).

Actuator with an axial transmission, in particular 
for steering a vehicle having four steerable wheels, 

with a hollow shaft (3) which can be driven by an electric 
motor and is coupled via an axially positionally 

secured spindle nut (5) to a concentric, axially 
displaceable adjustment rod (4) with a corresponding 

spindle component (4.1), characterized by an electric 
motor with a stator packet (1.1) which has a stator-side 

winding, and a permanently excited rotor with permanent 
magnets (3.1; 3.2) secured on the external circumference 

of the hollow shaft (3), and a mounting of the spindle 
nut (5), free of force fit in the manner of a joint 

formation, within the rotor space of the electric motor 
on the hollow shaft (3) which is supported axially on 

both sides in the housing of the actuator by angular 
contact ball-bearings (6; 7). 
Actuator according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the spindle nut (5) is secured in the hollow shaft 

(3) by means of a bonded connection. 
Actuator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
by an axially prestressed mounting of the angular contact 

ball-bearings (6; 7) in the housing of the actuator by 
means of appropriate spring properties of the housing. 
Actuator according to Claim 3, characterized by 
a two-component housing with two housing halves (1; 2) 

which can be axially tensioned with respect to one 
another in the manner of an axially pretensioned mounting 

of the angular contact ball-bearings (6; 7) and each 
receive an angular contact ball-bearing. 
Actuator according to one of Claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterized by an electromagnetic brake (8) which is 
mounted axially in front of the electric motor. 
Actuator according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
by a first housing half (1) which receives the electric 

motor and has a first bearing receptacle (1.2) for the 
adjustment rod (4) and a second housing half (2) which 

receives the electromagnetic brake (8) and has a second 
bearing receptacle (2.2) for the adjustment rod (4). 
Actuator according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized by an adjustment path detection device, 

mounted axially in front of the electromagnetic brake (8) 
and preferably arranged in a radially small, axial 

extension of the second bearing receptacle (2.2), in the 
form of a stator-side linear potentiometer (9) with a 

corresponding sliding contact (9.1) which is mounted on 
the adjustment rod (4). 
Actuator according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized by a first and second housing half (1 and 

2) with integrated end shield for the bearing receptacle 
(1.2 and 2.2) of the adjustment rod (4) and the support 

of one of the angular contact ball-bearings (6; 7) in 
each case, at least one end shield being provided in the 

manner of an axially pretensionable receptacle for the 
angular contact ball-bearings (6; 7) with a housing wall 

component (1.3) which is of corresponding axially elastic 
construction.
