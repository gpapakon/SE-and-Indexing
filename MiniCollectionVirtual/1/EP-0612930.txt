<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a carbon fibre reinforced carbon friction pad for a disk brake. By virtue of the fact that the rear surface (10) of the friction pad (9) is coated with a first layer (11) composed of a light alloy, at least one further layer (12) composed of an oxide-ceramic material and with a second layer (13) composed of a light alloy, by virtue of the fact that at least the first and the second metal layer (11, 13) also cover the encircling edge surface of the friction pad, and by virtue of the fact that the layers (11, 12, 13) are applied by a melt-spray method, the necessary temperature conditions can be maintained and optimum friction coefficients obtained.

A friction pad for a disc brake with carbon fibre-reinforced
carbon as friction material pad,

characterised in that the rear surface (10) of the
friction material pad (9) is securely coated in a meltspraying

operation with

a first layer (11) of a lightweight metal,
at least one additional layer (12) of an oxide-ceramic
material,
and a second layer (13) of a lightweight metal,

and that at least the first and the second layers of
metal (11, 13) also cover the circumambient edge

surface of the friction material pad.
A friction pad according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the friction material pad (9) is provided for

securing to the associated brake pincers by holding
means (7) and is detachably connected to a pressure

distribution plate (6) associated with the rear surface
(10).
A friction pad according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the holding means (7) are designed as eyes and

are positively connected to the friction material pad
(9).
A friction pad according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the holding means are formed by projections

(19) and/or recesses on the rear surface (10) of the
friction material pad (9) on one hand and projections

and/or recesses (20) on the pressure distribution plate
(6) on the other hand.
A friction pad according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that fine-grained coke in an 

approximately regular distribution is incorporated in
the base material of the friction material consisting

of carbon fibre-reinforced carbon.
A friction pad according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the reinforcing carbon fibres

have a short fibre length.
