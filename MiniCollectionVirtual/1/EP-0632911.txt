<ABSTRACT>
An error detector circuit (300), and an associated method, is disclosed for a discrete receiver, the error detector circuit (300) indicates bad frames of binary information signals which contain distorted bits of data in numbers so great as to prevent a convolutional decoder (312) from generating, accurately, a decoded signal. When bit errors are detected in numbers beyond a first preselected value of signal quality of a received signal combined with the detected number of bits errors forming a signal beyond a second preselected value, a bad frame is detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to error detector
circuitry for detecting errors of discretely-encoded signals
transmitted to a receiver and, more particularly, to a bad frame
indicator for detecting bad frames of information signals received by
a receiver constructed to receive discretely-encoded signals
comprised of coded frames.A communication system is comprised, at a minimum, of a
transmitter and a receiver interconnected by a transmission
channel. A communication signal is transmitted by the transmitter
upon the transmission channel, thereafter to be received by the
receiver. A radio communication system is a communication
system in which the transmission channel comprises a radio
frequency channel defined by a range of frequencies of the
electromagnetic frequency spectrum. A transmitter operative in a
radio communication system must convert the communication
signal into a form suitable for transmission thereof upon the radio
frequency channel.Conversion of the communication signal into a form suitable
for transmission thereof upon the radio frequency channel is
effectuated by a process referred to as modulation. In such a process,
the communication signal is impressed upon an electromagnetic
wave. The electromagnetic wave is commonly referred to as a
"carrier signal." The resultant signal, once modulated by the
communication signal, is commonly referred to as a modulated
carrier signal or, more simply, a modulated signal. The transmitter
includes circuitry operative to perform such a modulation process. Because the modulated carrier signal may be transmitted
through free space over large distances, radio communication
systems are widely utilized to effectuate communication between a
transmitter and a remotely-positioned receiver.The receiver of the radio communication system which
receives the modulated carrier signal contains circuitry analogous
to, but operative in a manner reverse with that of, the circuitry of
the transmitter and is operative to perform a process referred to as
demodulation.Numerous modulated carrier signals may be simultaneously
transmitted as long as the signals are transmitted upon differing
radio frequency channels defined upon the electromagnetic
frequency spectrum. Regulatory bodies have divided portions of
the electromagnetic frequency spectrum into frequency bands and
have regulated transmission of the modulated carrier signals upon
various ones of the frequency bands. (Frequency bands are further
divided into channels, and such channels form the radio
