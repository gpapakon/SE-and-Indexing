<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of thermal transfer
printing on color receiving sheets such as post cards, ordinary
paper and bond paper so as to avoid using exclusive color
receiving sheets pre-coated to have a color developing layer on
its surface. The method of thermal
transfer printing of the sublimation type uses the principle
that pigments sublimate or diffuse when they are subjected to
heat.Methods of outputting mono-color or full-color picture
images simply and quickly without using general typing or
printing include an ink jet method and thermal transfer
printing method. A sublimation type thermal transfer printing
method using an exclusive color receiving sheet pre-coated
for formation of a color developing layer thereon is considered
the best method of outputting full-color pictorial images and
features excellent continuous gradient and compares well to
true full color photographs. Quite naturally this thermal
transfer printing method spread quickly but in time there has
been a growing desire for a method of attaining an equally
excellent image quality on ordinary non-exclusive sheets
generally used at home and office such as post cards, ordinary
paper, bond paper and dull art papers. To meet this growing
desire, the following thermal transfer printing method has been 
proposed.FIG. 12 is a schematic diagram showing the method in use
and reference numeral 31 represents a transfer sheet. The
transfer sheet 31 has on one side of its transfer substrate 33
(made of, for example, polyester film) a heat-resisting and
slipping layer 32 and on the other side a color developing
layer 34, yellow dye layer 35, magenta dye layer 36 and cyan
dye layer 37 are provided in this order.
Reference numeral 38 represents a thermal head, 39 a platen
roller, 40 a color receiving sheet such as a post card or
ordinary paper 41 and a conveying roller for conveying color
receiving sheet 40.First, the working principle of this method will be
explained below with reference to FIG. 13 (A) or (B). As shown
in FIG. 13 (A), the transfer sheet 31 and the color receiving
sheet 40 are inserted between the thermal head 38 and the
platen roller 39 to bring the color developing layer 34 into
contact with the color receiving sheet. Then, the platen
roller 39 is rotated and the transfer sheet 31 and the color
receiving sheet 40 are conveyed in the direction indicated by
the arrow. The thermal head 38 is heated from behind the heat-resisting
and slipping layer 32 so as to melt the color
developing layer 34 all-over. Since the
