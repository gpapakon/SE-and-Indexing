<ABSTRACT>
Closure (1) for a reagent vessel (3) which can be used in an analytical apparatus in which an automatic pipetting apparatus is used for transferring small amounts of reagent from the reagent vessel (3) to reaction cuvettes, the pipetting apparatus having a pipetting needle (13) which is automatically guided by a transport apparatus, the free open end (19) of which pipetting needle lies in a plane which forms a first acute angle ( theta ) with the longitudinal axis of the pipetting needle, which closure (1) is a part formed in one piece from a plastic and has a cylindrical side wall (4) and an upper wall (5) bordering on the side wall. To reduce the requirements of the accuracy of the transport apparatus of the pipetting needle, the closure is characterised in that the central region of the upper wall (5) has a puncture zone (16) which is formed by an arrangement of identically sized recesses (11) which are situated next to each other, adjacent recesses (11) each being delimited from each other by a partition (15) which forms a sharp edge (17) at its free upper end and the bottom (12) of each recess (11) being able to be pierced by the automatically guided pipetting needle (13) of the pipetting apparatus.
