<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel block 
copolymer composition for use in adhesives. More 
particularly, it relates to branched three-armed 
styrene-isoprene block copolymer compositions 
comprised of polymeric blocks and adhesives made using 
such compositions. It is known that a block copolymer can be 
obtained by an anionic copolymerization of a 
conjugated diene compound and an alkenyl arene 
compound by using an organic alkali metal initiator. 
Block copolymers have been produced which comprise 
primarily those having a general structure 
   A-B and A-B-A 
wherein the polymer blocks A comprise thermoplastic 
polymer block of alkenyl arenes such as polystyrene, 
while block B is a polymer block of a conjugated diene 
such as polyisoprene. The proportion of the 
thermoplastic blocks to the elastomeric polymer block 
and the relative molecular weight of each of these 
blocks is balanced to obtain a rubber having unique 
performance characteristics. When the content of the 
alkenyl arene is small, i.e. 5-30%, the produced block 
copolymer is a so-called thermoplastic rubber. In 
such a rubber, the blocks A are thermodynamically 
incompatible with the blocks B resulting in a rubber 
consisting of two phases - a continuous elastomeric 
phase (blocks B) and a basically discontinuous hard, 
glass-like plastic phase (blocks A) - called domains. 
Since the A-B-A block copolymers have two A blocks 
separated by a B block, domain formation results in 
effectively locking the B blocks and their inherent 
entanglements in place by the A blocks and forming a  
 
network structure at normal use temperature. These alkenyl arene domains act as physical 
crosslinks anchoring the ends of many block copolymer 
chains. Such a phenomenon allows the A-B-A rubber to 
behave like a conventionally vulcanized rubber in the 
unvulcanized state and is applicable for various uses. 
For example, these network forming polymers are 
applicable for uses such as in adhesive formulations; 
in molded shoe soles; as an impact modifier for 
polystyrene resins and engineering thermoplastics; for 
modification of asphalt; etc. Styrenic block copolymers are widely used to 
make pressure sensitive adhesives for a wide variety 
of uses including tapes, labels and product assembly 
applications. Pressure sensitive adhesives based on 
styrenic block copolymers such as KRATON® 
thermoplastic rubber provide excellent adhesion to a 
wide variety of substrates, including paper, cardboard 
and other cellulosic materials. EP-A-451 920 discloses a low
