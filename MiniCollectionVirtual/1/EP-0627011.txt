<ABSTRACT>
Diagnostics and procedures are provided for detecting myotonic dystrophy in humans. The diagnostics and procedures are based on the detection of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in a variable length polymorphism of the myotonic dystrophy gene derived from the region of human chromosome 19q13 containing the myotonic dystrophy locus.

form "DM" will be used throughout the description of the invention. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common inherited neuromuscular 
disease of adult life. The disease is known to affect 1 in 8,000 people 
worldwide. The disease is distributed worldwide with a significant prevalence 
in the French-Canadian population. In the Saguenay region of Quebec 
myotonic dystrophy affects an estimated 1 out of every 500 people based on 
surveys conducted by various muscular dystrophy associations. The number 
of diagnoses for myotonic dystrophy greatly exceeds all other muscular 
dystrophies including Duchenne muscular
