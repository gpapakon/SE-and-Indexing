<ABSTRACT>
The device works with at least one dosing device (10, 20) which has an adjustable wall (12) with which the dosing volume of the dosing chamber (11) can be adjusted. The dosed beverage powder is emptied by way of a movable flap (18) and falls via the discharge funnel (9) into the extraction chamber (4') of an extraction beaker (4). During the brewing process, the extraction plunger (8) lies in the brewing chamber (4'). The extraction plunger (8) is also adjustable. Both the movable wall (12) and the movable extraction plunger (8) are actuated via a single actuating member (31) which acts on transmission means (30).

Apparatus for the preparation of hot beverages by extraction, particularly 
for the preparation of coffee, with at least one dosing device (10, 20) for 

the beverage powder, a hot water conditioner and a water pump (37), as well as 
a movable extraction cup (4), which can be fixed to a movable holder (3), 

which is guided in a control path (2) and consequently moves the extraction 
cup (4) into a position, where it comes into operative connection with an 

extraction plunger (8), and in which the at least one dosing device (10, 20) 
has a displaceable wall (12, 24), characterized in that the wall can be moved 

mechanically by means of a transmission means (30) incorporating an operating 
member (31) and which simultaneously adjusts the extraction plunger (8) in the 

movement direction of the extraction cup (4) relative to the latter, so that 
through the movement of the transmission means (30) it is possible to vary the 

dosing quantity of the beverage powder and its volume between the extraction 
plunger (8) and cup (4) as a function of the common operating member (31). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the common operating 
member (31) acts on a shaft, on which is located on the one hand an eccentric 

(48), which adjusts the plunger (8), and on the other by means of a belt 
pulley (32) moves a toothed belt (34), which together form the transmission 

means (30). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the at least one 
dosing device (20) has a dosing chamber (11), whose movable wall (12) runs on 

a slide (13), on which is located a switch (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the at least one 
dosing device (20) comprises a cylindrical chamber (22), which is bounded by a 

part cylindrical jacket wall (26) and a movable cylinder end wall (24) connected 
in one piece thereto, as well as a fixed wall (23). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that two dosing devices 
(10, 20) are provided, one dosing device (10) being supplied by a grinder, 

whilst the other dosing device (20) can be supplied by a storage container 
(50), and that both dosing devices issue into a common feed funnel (9).  

 
Apparatus according to claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the two dosing 
devices (10, 20) have different constructions and the dosing device (10) with 

the displaceable wall (12) can be supplied by a grinder, whilst that with the 
displaceable cylinder wall (24) is supplied by a storage container (50). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the vertically 
adjustable extraction plunger (8) is in two parts and the two plunger parts 

are interconnected in guided (43) and sprung (47) manner. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the transmission 
means incorporate a toothed belt (34), by means of which at least one driver 

(14, 21) can be moved, which acts directly or indirectly on the adjustable 
wall (12, 24) of at least one dosing device (10, 20). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the transmission 
means (30) is a rod-lever drive. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that by means of the 
operating member (31), in the vicinity of the maximum beverage powder dosing, 

an action takes place on a control of the water pump (37), so as to double the 
water supply quantity. 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that a slider (35) is 
located on the transmission means (34) and acts on a control switch (36) for 

the water pump (37).
