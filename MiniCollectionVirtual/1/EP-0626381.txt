<ABSTRACT>
Pure Form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride is prepared 
by a process of crystallization from a solution of 

ranitidine hydrochloride in a mixed solvent comprising 1 
part by volume of at least one lower alkanol such as 

ethanol and 1 - 2.0 parts by volume of a C₆ - C₁₀ aromatic 

hydrocarbon such as toluene, and in the presence of seed 
crystals of pure Form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride. In the 

preferred process according to the invention, the 
ranitidine hydrochloride is prepared 
in situ
 in the solvent 
mixture by adding hydrochloric acid to a solution of the 

free base in the solvent mixture, in the presence of the 
seed crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the pharmaceutical 
chemical compound known as ranitidine hydrochloride, and to 
processes for its preparation and isolation in a specific 
crystalline form. Ranitidine is, chemically, N-[2-[[[5-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-2-furanyl]methyl]thio]ethyl]-N'-methyl-2-nitro-1,1-ethene 
diamine, and has the chemical structural 
formula: 
   In the form of its hydrochloride salt, ranitidine 
has achieved widespread acceptance as a medicament for 
treating ulcers. The patent and technical literature concerning 
ranitidine hydrochloride reports that it exists in two 
different crystalline forms, Form 1 and Form 2. The 
preparation and characteristics of ranitidine hydrochloride 
Form 2, which is the commercially marketed form, are 
described in Canadian Patent no. 1,202,638 Crookes, 
assigned to Glaxo Group Limited, and issued April 1, 1986. 
In this patent disclosure, ranitidine hydrochloride Form 1 
is reported to be formed by precipitation and crystallization 
from a solution of ranitidine in industrial methylated 
spirit containing hydrogen chloride, by addition of ethyl 
acetate thereto. It is also reported therein that Form 1 
ranitidine hydrochloride so produced has unsuitable 
filtration and drying characteristics, and that Form 2 
ranitidine hydrochloride has more advantageous properties, 
and better characteristics from a manufacturing point of 
view. This Form 2 ranitidine hydrochloride is reportedly 
obtained by appropriately chosen crystallization processes. 
One of these is dissolving the free base in a hydroxylic  
 
solvent such as propan-2-ol and treating the solution with 
hydrochloric acid, followed by crystallization at an 
elevated temperature by adding further quantities of 
propan-2-ol. Another is dissolving Form 1 ranitidine 
hydrochloride in methanol or ethanol with warming, followed 
by cooling to cause crystallization of the Form 2 salt, 
optionally accompanied by the addition of an anti-solvent 
or accompanied by seeding with Form 2 ranitidine 
hydrochloride crystals. The present invention provides a novel 
crystallization process for the production of Form 1 
ranitidine hydrochloride. Whereas Form 2 ranitidine 
hydrochloride is generally formed on precipitation and 
crystallization from alcohol, it has been found according 
to the present invention that, if ranitidine hydrochloride 
is crystallized from a solution comprising a mixture of one 
or more lower aliphatic alcohols and an aromatic hydrocarbon 
within a certain range of relative proportions of 
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing Form 1 ranitidine 
hydrochloride, which comprises: 


forming a solution of ranitidine hydrochloride 
in a mixed solvent comprising at least one C₁ - C₄ alkanol 

and a C₆ - C₁₀ aromatic hydrocarbon, the volume ratio of 
alkanol(s) to hydrocarbon being from 1:1 to 1:2; 
and initiating crystallization of Form 1 
ranitidine hydrochloride from said solution in the presence 

of seed crystals of pure Form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride. 
The process of claim 1, including the preliminary 
step of adding hydrochloric acid to a solution of 

ranitidine free base or soluble salt thereof in said 
mixture of solvents. 
The process of claim 2, wherein the hydrochloric 
acid is added in an amount of from 0.8 to 1.15 molar 

equivalents of acid per molar equivalent of free base. 
The process of claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the 
hydrochloric acid is added in an amount of from 0.95 

to 1.0 molar equivalents of acid per molar equivalent of 
free base. 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the 
aromatic hydrocarbon is toluene. 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the 
alkanol is ethanol or isopropanol, or a mixture thereof. 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the 
volume ratio of alkanol(s) to aromatic hydrocarbon at the 

initiation of crystallization is about 1:1.5.  
 
The process of any preceding claim, including the 
additional and subsequent step of washing the Form 1 

ranitidine hydrochloride so formed with isopropanol. 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the 
alkanol is ethanol.
