<ABSTRACT>
During the separation of bulk material into at least two fractions with the use of a vibratory table (1) onto which the bulk material is put, very light and/or laminar particles with comparatively high-grade purity can be separated owing to the fact that the fraction which can be brought by vibration to the surface of the bulk material is drawn off upwards in the area of the discharge edge (10) of the vibratory table (1) by means of a suction nozzle (19) from the surface of the bulk-material mat accommodated on the vibratory table (1) and/or crossing the discharge edge (10), and that the remainder is discharged via the discharge edge (10).

<CLAIMS>
Device for the separation of particles capable of being extracted from a bulk
material, with at least one vibratory table (1) fitted in a housing and connected to a

vibratory drive (2,2), having at least one discharge edge (10) and being assigned at
least one feeder (12; 36) at a distance from the discharge edge (10), wherein the

vibratory table (1) is in the form of an air-permeable screening table which can be
fed from below with air with may be drawn off from the top section (8) of the

housing via an outlet air duct (18), 
characterized in that
 the airflow through the
vibratory table (1) is so adjustable that fluidisation of the bulk material does not

occur, that to suck off the mat of concentrated particles formed in the upper zone of
the bulk material through the vibration of the vibratory table (1) and by the air

passing through the vibratory table (1), there is provided at least one suction tube
(19), located in a frontal zone in the direction of feed of the vibratory table (1),

overlapping the vibratory table (1) along its entire width, capable of being provided
with an induced draught via a suction line (20) separate from the outlet air duct

(18), and adjustable relative to the vibratory table (1) in the lowering and
longitudinal direction, and that fine-grained material falling through the vibratory

table (1) may be collected and removed by means of a removal device mounted

below the vibratory table (1).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the suction tube (19) has a
telescopically extending and adjustable inlet nozzle (26).
Device according to according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the suction tube (19) is assigned an adjustable secondary air inlet (22).
Device according to according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the suction tube (19) has a swivelling inlet zone.
Device according to according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the suction tube (19) is connected to a separator (23) which is connected to an
exhaust fan (21). 
Device according to according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the air flow through the vibrating screen forming the vibratory table (1) is in
the range between 0.2 and 0.75 of the air flow of a counter-current classifier of

comparable size.
Device according to according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the feeder assigned to the vibratory table (1), the slope of which is preferably
adjustable relative to its discharge edge (10), is in the form of a light material

outlet of an upstream counter-current classifier which has an air-permeable
vibratory screen (28) which may be driven in the opposite direction to the

vibratory table (1), which is arranged so as to rise from its floating-off edge (37)
to its discharge edge (33) lying opposite the former and which may be supplied

with bulk material, wherein the vibratory screen (28) and the vibratory table (1)
are preferably arranged consecutively in the longitudinal direction, and are linked

to one another by means of a guide element (36) bridging the gap and preferably
in the form of a chute.
Device according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the discharge edge (10) of the
vibratory table (1) and the discharge edge (33) of the upstream counter-current

classifier are each assigned an adjustable suction tube (19).
