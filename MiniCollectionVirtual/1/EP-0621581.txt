<ABSTRACT>
An electronic display and electronic display controller is 
provided for quickly and precisely adjusting visibility 

parameters of an object being displayed. The electronic display 
controller includes a clocking circuit capable of producing 

varying frequency clocking pulses which can be received by a 
potentiometer to incrementally adjust the visibility of a 

displayed object. Activation of one or more buttons on the 
external housing of the display will cause low frequency clocking 

signals to be sent to the potentiometer and, after a set period 
of time, higher frequency clocking signals can be sent provided 

the button remains active. Initial low frequency and subsequent 
high frequency clocking signals ensure higher precision initial 

tuning and, if needed, rapid course tuning of the object 
visibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic display, and preferably to a variable speed clocking circuit for controlling the display. Electronic displays are well known in the art. As used 
herein, "electronic display" represents any electronically 
controlled terminal or monitor for displaying graphic and/or 
alphanumeric symbols. Electronic display includes any active or 
passive display device. Active devices include displays 
utilizing the various light-emitting processes such as, for 
example, cathodoluminescence, photoluminescence, 
electroluminescence, plasma decay and blackbody radiation. 
Cathodoluminescence includes cathode ray tubes (CRTs), 
photoluminescence includes colored gas discharge devices and 
fluorescent lamps, and electroluminescent devices include light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs). Plasma decay and blackbody radiation 
techniques are typically used in gas discharge panels and 
tungsten filament projection devices, respectively. Passive 
displays include displays controlled by light-absorption or 
light-reflection processes. Passive displays include 
electromechanical, electrochromeric, electropolarization and 
electrophoretic display techniques. The most popular passive 
display, utilizing electropolarization, includes liquid crystal 
displays (LCDs). Electronic displays can present an object (alphanumeric 
character or graphic depiction) using various font geometries. 
For example, a CRT typically utilizes a large array of pixels 
arranged across the entire display area. One or more pixels may  
 
become illuminated to register a portion of the desired object. 
Thus, CRTs are often used to present alphanumeric or graphic 
objects. Passive displays, such as LCDs, often utilize seven or 
ten segment fonts. Instead of having an array of pixels arranged 
across the entire screen area, segments are arranged on a portion 
of the screen area. When one or more segments are illuminated, a 
corresponding alphanumeric symbol is formed. Various types of 
fonts become suitable depending upon the display technology 
chosen. Regardless of the display technology chosen or the font 
being displayed, electronic displays are generally adjustable to 
suit human perception. The object can be moved horizontally or 
vertically by actuating one or more buttons arranged on the 
display housing. The viewing range, either horizontal 
vertical range, may also be expanded or contracted to suit the 
viewer. Still further, many displays have switches which can 
vary the "visibility" of the object being displayed.
