<ABSTRACT>
A cash safe (1) has a banknote input/output unit (10) for cashiers operating on both sides. A banknote storage unit (35) is arranged in the armoured safe base unit (15). The banknotes to be dispensed from the safe base unit (15) are supplied in a dispensing unit (11) of the banknote input/output unit (10) in such a way that they can only ever be extracted by one of the two cashiers. The banknote input/output unit (10) can be removed as a whole, undismantled, from the safe base unit (15), even then unauthorised access to the banknotes deposited in the banknote storage unit (15) being impossible. The cash safe (1), on account of its modularity, has high serviceability which is increased, in particular, by simple releasable connections for covering or partitioning panels (83a, 83b) standing vertically one on the other, by the banknote storage unit (35) extendable out of the safe base unit (15) and by a fastening means (9) for relieving tension on cable bundles (115).

<CLAIMS>
Cashier's safe (1) for cashiers (4a, 4b) operating at
both sides, having a banknote receiving/dispensing unit (10)

to which only one of the two cashiers has free access at any
one time, and a banknote storage unit (35) arranged in an

armoured safe base unit (15), characterised in that the
banknote receiving/dispensing unit (10) can be removed

complete in a non-dismantled state from the safe base unit
(15) and the safe base unit (15) has, in a wall adjacent to

the removable banknote receiving/dispensing unit (10),
merely at least one narrow opening (22, 22a/b) for banknote

delivery from the banknote storage unit (35) arranged in the
safe base unit (15) to the banknote receiving/dispensing

unit (10) so that unauthorised access to the banknotes in
the banknote storage unit (35) is not possible when the

banknote receiving/dispensing unit (10) has been removed.
Cashier's safe (1) according to claim 1, characterised
in that the banknote receiving/dispensing unit (10) is

arranged at the top of the safe base unit (15) together with
a similarly removable casing component (9), the casing

component (9) containing no working elements and being used
only for outer appearance and being removable, so that the

cashier's safe (1) can be pushed under a partition counter
(3) in a bank counter hall in order to save space.
Cashier's safe (1) according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the banknote storage unit (35) can be taken

out in a complete non-dismantled state from the safe base
unit (15), especially moved out. 
Cashier's safe (1) according to claim 3, characterised
by an unlockable mechanical locking element (67, 69) in the

safe base unit (15) for fixing the position of the banknote
storage unit (35), and an electrical switch unit (75)

cooperable with the locking element (67, 69) in order to be
able to connect up the banknote storage unit (35) without

power, in the unlocked state.
Cashier's safe (1) according to claim 4, characterised
in that the locking element is in the form of a locking

catch (67) and the switch unit (75) is connected to the
locking catch (67) by way of a force transmission element

(71, 73) which transmits the catch movement to the switch
unit (75) in order to switch the power supply on and off.
Cashier's safe (1) according to claim 4 or 5, characterised
in that the banknote storage unit (35) can be pushed

on guide elements (62, 63) into the safe base unit (15) and
has a first electrical contact coupling element (65) which

can be releasably coupled, parallel to the insertion direction,
to a second contact coupling element arranged in the

safe base unit (15).
Cashier's safe according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised by a connection for the releasable attachment

of a first to a second perpendicularly arranged covering or
dividing metal sheet (83a, 83b), the end face of the first

metal sheet (83a) being arranged perpendicularly on one of
the sheet surfaces of the other metal sheet (83b) and the 

two metal sheets (83a, 83b) having only punched-out portions
(85a, 85b) at the place of connection.
Cashier's safe according to claim 7, characterised by a
first, slot-shaped, punched-out portion (87a) extending in

the first metal sheet (83a) approximately parallel to the
first metal sheet's supporting edge (86) at the second metal

sheet (83b), a connecting element (91) having a holding
element (89) which is at least partially insertable into the

first punched-out portion (87a), and a second punched-out
portion (85b) in the second metal sheet (83b) through which

the connecting element (91) can be inserted.
Cashier's safe according to claim 8, characterised in
that the holding element (89) has at least one stop (103)

which is wider by a tolerance than the first punched-out
portio
n (87a) in order to prevent the holding element (89)
from being pushed completely through the first punched-out

portion (87a).
Cashier's safe according to claim 8 or 9, characterised
by a recess (87b) which extends from the supporting edge

(86) of the first metal sheet (83a) for the second metal
sheet (83b) into the first punched-out portion (87a) and

through which the connecting element (91) can engage in a
force application element (93) of the inserted holding

element (89).
Cashier's safe according to any one of claims 8 to 10,
characterised by a clip (94) which can be slipped over at

least one side of the holding element in order to secure the 
holding element against sliding out of the first punched-out

portion (87a).
Cashier's safe according to claim 11, characterised in
that the connecting element is a screw (91), the recess

(87b) is wider by a clearance than the outside spacing of
the limbs (96a/96c, 96b/96d) of the clip (94) and extends

perpendicularly to the supporting edge (86), which is
adjacent to the second metal sheet (83b), of the first metal

sheet (83a) and the first punched-out portion (87a) extends
approximately parallel to that supporting edge (86), the

holding element (89) is plate-like and the first force
application element in the holding element (89) is in the

form of a threaded bore (93) for the screw (91), and a
second force application element for the screw (91), which

is under a tensile force when the connection has been
produced, is the screw head which can be applied to that

sheet surface of the second metal sheet (83b) which is
remote from the first metal sheet (83a).
Cashier's safe according to any one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised by a fastening means (109) for the strain

relief especially of shielded conductors (115) of a cable
bundle, a channel-like holding rail (111) which is a

U-shaped bend in cross-section and a press plate (113) which
covers the rail (111) and by means of which the cables (115)
