<ABSTRACT>
A metamorphic book which in its closed form resembles a book 
and in an open form defines an object such as a plaything. 

The book has a pair of covers (1) and a plurality of pages 
(2) which are interconnected by a spine (4). Each of the 

pages is self-supporting on the spine and the pages can be 
fanned apart so that the book adopts a second stable 

configuration. In the second configuration the covers may 
be opened through 360° and joined, for example to enable the 

book to define a ball, or the covers may form a base or be 
arranged to open through an intermediate angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to books that can be transformed to 
or presented as other articles such as playthings or 
ornaments. In recent years there have been various developments with 
books for young children rendering them more versatile as 
playthings as well as books. For example books have been 
made with structures to facilitate finger puppetry, and 
collections of books have been provided with rocking or 
other novel containers. The present invention is directed towards providing a book 
that may also be a plaything or an object other than a 
simple book. An advantage in such an arrangement is that it 
may provide versatility not only in the uses and interest of 
the book, but also in enabling alternative methods of 
display and storage for books other than the conventional 
bookcase. US Patent Specification 4,819,963 discloses a combination 
book and three dimensional sculpture. The sculpture 
is provided with a split through the centre so that the two 
halves can be hingedly interconnected and separated. Within 
the sculpture are a plurality of pages which are also 
interconnected at the hinged edge of the sculpture. The 
pages are cut to a shape in registration with the outline 
defined by the cut surface of the structure. In essence, the sculpture may be regarded as an extension of 
decorative book covers, in this instance the idea extending 
such that in its closed configuration the book resembles a 
sculpture possibly even disguising that the object is a 
book.  US specification 4,120,100 illustrates an educational book 
device with a spiral binding that opens to form a globe or 
other three dimensional shape. The binding has a hinge 
midway along its length to enable flaps on individual pages 
to lie flat or be made to extend from the page by rotating 
the respective halves of the spine towards one another. 
When the flaps are extended and the pages fanned apart the 
flaps act as spacers to hold the pages apart in an open 
configuration. Pockets for interconnection with the flaps 
are also provided. According to the present invention there is provided a 
metamorphic book comprising:
 
a pair of substantially flat book covers;
 
a plurality of pages; and
 
a spine interconnecting an adjacent edge on each of the 
covers and pages, the spine being flexible and capable of 
supporting individual pages so that the book can be 
transformed from a closed, book configuration to at least 
one open configuration in which the pages adopt a stable 
fanned out configuration, the individual pages being
