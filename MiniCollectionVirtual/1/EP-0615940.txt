<ABSTRACT>
A follower roller (100) adapted to be rotated while 
coming in contact with a recording medium (120) is rotatably 

mounted on a driving roller shaft (114) of a driving roller 
(113), i.e., one of an opposing pair of driving rollers (111) and 

(113), and a rotation detector (115) for detecting the rotation 
of the follower roller (100) is disposed in the vicinity of the 

driving roller (113). A controller detects a malfunction of 
paper clogging by comparing the detection signal outputted 

from the rotation detector (115) with the driving signal 
outputted from the controller for rotationally driving a 

paper feeding motor. The follower roller (100) includes a 
ring-shaped magnet (121) including a plurality of magnet 

segments which are alternately magnetized in such a manner 
that adjacent magnet segments exhibit different magnetic 

poles with a radially extending boundary line as a boundary 
therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a printing
apparatus.A conventional printing apparatus of the type
including detecting means for detecting a malfunction that
the printing apparatus is clogged with a fraction of printing
paper is hitherto known as disclosed in DE-A-2558961.The
detecting means disclosed in the official gazette of the
prior invention will be described below with reference to
Fig. 13.In the drawing, reference numeral 8 designates a
printing medium such as a sheet of printing paper or the
like. The printing medium 8 is conveyed further while it is
held between a plurality of driving rollers 11 and a
plurality of clamping or contact rollers 10a in the clamped
state. The contact rollers 10a are normally biased toward the
driving rollers 11 so that they are followably rotated by the
printing medium 8 while they are brought in contact with the
printing medium 8. A circular rotary plate 10b is fixedly 
secured to the right-hand end of a shaft for the contact
rollers 10a such that it is rotated together with the contact
rollers 10a. The circular rotary plate 10b serves as an
encoder including two magnets 23 along the outer periphery
thereof. With this construction, a conveying speed of the
printing medium 8 is detected in the form of an electrical
signal as a lead switch 21 is turned on or off by the magnets
23.The conventional printing apparatus is equipped with
two paper speed detecting mechanism each constructed in the
above-described manner along a paper conveyance path in order
to detect a malfunction that the printing apparatus is
clogged with a part of the recording medium 8 based on the
difference arising between the conveying speed of the
recording medium 8 detected by the first paper speed
detecting mechanism and the conveying speed of the same
detected by the second paper speed detecting mechanism.According to the aforementioned technical concept,
since the contact rollers 10a and the circular rotary plate
10b are rotated by bringing the contact rollers 10a in
contact with the printing medium 8, a certain magnitude of
rotational load appearing attributable to the arrangement of
the contact rollers 10a, the circular rotary plate 10b and
the shaft extending through the contact rollers 10a and the
circular rotary plate 10b is applied to the contact surface
of the printing medium 8. This rotational load functions as 
a shearing power effective in the conveying direction of the
recording medium 8.In the case that the recording medium 8 is prepared
in the form of a band-shaped
