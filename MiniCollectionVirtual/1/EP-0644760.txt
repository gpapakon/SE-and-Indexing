<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to diseases characterized by
neovascularization and the use of imidazoles that inhibit the
Ca++ activated potassium channel in arresting or inhibiting
such neovascularization.A normal artery typically is lined on its inner-side by
a single layer of endothelial cells, the intima. The intima
overlays the media, which contains only a single cell type,
the vascular smooth muscle cell. The outer-most layer of the
artery is the adventitia.Neovascularization, or angiogenesis, is the growth and
development of new arteries. It is critical to the normal
development of the vascular system, including injury-repair.
There are, however, conditions characterized by abnormal
neovascularization, including diabetic retinopathy,
neovascular glaucoma, rheumatiod arthritis, psoriasis and
certain cancers. For example, diabetic retinopathy is a
leading cause of blindness. There are two types of diabetic
retinopathy, simple and proliferative. Proliferative
retinopathy is characterized by neovascularization and.
scarring. About one-half of those patients with
proliferative retinopathy progress to blindness within about
five years.Another example of abnormal neovascularization is that
associated with solid tumors. It is now established that
unrestricted growth of tumors is dependant upon angiogenesis,
and that induction of angiogenesis by liberation of angiogenic
factors can be an important step in carcinogenesis. For
example, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is liberated
by several cancer cells and plays a crucial role in cancer 
angiogenesis. The demonstration that certain animal tumors regress when
angiogenesis is inhibited has provided the most compelling evidence for the role of
angiogenesis in tumor growth.It would be desirable to identify antiangiogenesis agents useful in treating the
foregoing diseases.Imidazoles are synthetic antifungal agents that are used both typically and
systematically. Indications for their use include ringworm, tinea versicolor and
mucocutaneous candidiasis. These compounds are believed to act by inhibiting
ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell wall, and when given topically, may cause
direct damage to the cytoplasmic membrane.The fungi comprise five widely differing classes of primitive flora, and the variation
in cell physiology and biochemistry are extreme. As a result, most antifungal agents
have a very narrow spectrum of antifungal activity.Both US 5,059,590 and US 3,678,030 discloses a group of imidazole derivatives and
their use as anti-tumour agents which

erythrocytes, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells or proliferation of

endothelial cells, for the preparation of a medicament for use in treating an
angiogenic condition selected from the group comprising:

from the group comprising: hemangioendotheliomas; hemangiomas; Kaposi's

Sarcoma; diabetic retinopathy; non-hormone dependent solid tumor;
neovascular glaucoma; rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis and prostate cancer in a

subject who has been castrated.
Use of clotrimazole or salt thereof for the preparation of a medicament for
treating an angiogenic condition wherein said angiogenic condition is other

than psoriasis.
The use according to claim 4, wherein said angiogenic condition is selected
from the group comprising: hemangioendotheliomas; hemangiomas; Kaposi's

Sarcoma; diabetic retinopathy; non-hormone dependent solid tumor;
neovascular glaucoma; rheumatoid arthritis and prostate cancer in a subject

who has been castrated.
