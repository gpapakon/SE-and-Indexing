<ABSTRACT>
A microwave oven, in particular for rapid heating at high temperature, characterised in that it includes:   - a metal box (10) having the shape of a cylinder which is open at one (12) of its ends, in the cylindrical side wall (16) of which cylinder at least one waveguide (18) emerges, which waveguide is coupled to a microwave generator (20), - a first outer layer (26) of a thermally insulating material which is transparent to microwaves, applied against the inner surface of the cylindrical side wall (16) of the box (10) and having its lower surface resting on - a second inner layer (28) of thermally insulating material which is transparent to microwaves, having a central opening (30) capable of receiving - a layer (32) which is made of a material which absorbs microwaves and constitutes the heating enclosure of the oven, as well as - a metal plate (38) for closing off the open end of the said metal box (10).
