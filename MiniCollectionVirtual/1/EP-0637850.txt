<ABSTRACT>
A nonaqueous electrolyte battery comprises:
 

   a positive electrode comprising a mixture of manganese 
dioxide and a fluorinated graphite as a positive electrode 

active material,
 

   a negative electrode comprising lithium metal or a 
substance capable of occluding and discharging lithium ion 

as a negative electrode material, and
 

   a nonaqueous electrolyte,
 

said fluorinated graphite being represented by the formula 
(CFx)n wherein 1.2 ≦ x ≦ 1.4 and contained in said mixture 

in a ratio by weight of 0.1 to 4%. This battery hardly 
undergoes self discharge and has excellent storage 

capability, since reaction products formed by reaction of 
manganese dioxide and the nonaqueous electrolyte used hardly 

react with lithium on the negative electrode side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonaqueous 
electrolyte battery and, more specifically, to improvement 
of positive electrode active material to improve the storage 
capability. Lithium batteries (primary battery) have the advantages 
of 1 ○ higher weight energy density compared to conventional 
alkali batteries, 2 ○ achievement of high operating voltages 
of 3 to 4 V by selecting an appropriate positive electrode 
active material, and 3 ○ good storage capability thanks to 
formation of a thin protective film having ionic conductivity 
on the surface of lithium negative electrode as caused by 
reaction with the electrolyte used (aprotic organic 
solution). Lithium batteries have therefore been widely 
used as power source for watches, electronic calculators, 
cameras, instruments and the like. Among lithium batteries, manganese dioxide-lithium 
batteries, having manganese dioxide as a positive electrode 
active material, are currently produced in the largest 
volume, since they have better battery characteristics  
 
compared to other lithium batteries and are advantageous in 
raw material cost due to low price of manganese oxide. However, with conventional manganese dioxide-lithium 
batteries, the manganese oxide reacts with the electrolyte 
used during storage and the resulting reaction products 
further react with the lithium on the negative electrode 
side so that the batteries undergo self discharge (self 
discharge rate: about 1%/year). These batteries are therefore 
not provided with satisfactory storage capability. As a result of an intensive study, the present 
inventors have found that the storage capability markedly 
improves when a fluorinated graphite having a specific 
fluorine content is added to manganese dioxide in a specific 
amount. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 88671/1982 
proposes a nonaqueous electrolyte battery utilizing a 
mixture of manganese dioxide and a fluorinated graphite as a 
positive electrode active material. However, the fluorinated 
graphite used in the battery proposed by this application 
has a relatively low fluorine content. Thus, the compound 
is represented by formula (CyFx)n wherein y is 1 or 2 and x 
is not more than about 1.1. With respect to storage 
capability which the present invention intends to improve, 
this type battery is of the same level as the above 
mentioned conventional manganese dioxide-lithium batteries 
utilizing manganese-dioxide only singly.  
 Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a nonaqueous
