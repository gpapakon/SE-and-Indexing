<ABSTRACT>
Compositions having balata and a modifier such as 
polyolefin rubber in an amount sufficient to provide a 

Young's modulus of 400-5,000 psi. These compositions 
can be formed into golf ball covers having 

surprisingly improved resistance to shear damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to golf balls and, 
more particularly, to golf ball covers made from 
balata formulations. Three types of golf balls are on the market: 
one-piece, two-piece and wound. One-piece balls are 
molded from a homogeneous mass of material, while two-piece 
golf balls are made by molding a cover about a 
solid core. The solid core can be a single 
homogeneous mass, a plurality of pieces, or have 
varying physical characteristics from its center to 
its surface. Wound balls have a cover molded about a 
wound core that is prepared by winding thin elastic 
thread about a center. Both two-piece and wound balls are made by 
molding covers about cores in one of two ways: (1) by 
injection molding of fluid cover stock material around 
a core which is held in a retractable pin mold; or 
(2) by compression molding preformed half-shells about 
a core. The preformed half-shells are formed by 
compression molding fluid cover stock material into 
half-shell molds and solidifying the cover stock 
material into a half-shell preform. Balata was the standard material for golf ball 
covers until E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Co. 
introduced Suryln®. Balata, however, continues to be 
an important cover material because of the control 
afforded by balata and because of the "click" and 
"feel" imparted by balata as compared to Surlyn®. "Click" refers to the sound made when the club 
impacts upon the ball, and "feel" is the overall  
 
sensation imparted to the golfer when the ball is hit. 
Although "click" and "feel" are not quantifiable, they 
are very real characteristics of any golf ball and 
some golfers prefer balata covered balls for these 
very reasons. The surfaces of balata covered golf balls, 
however, are prone to shear damage caused by grooves 
on the club face as the club face moves across the 
ball during impact. Shear damage often is shown as 
"scuff marks" on the ball surface. Scuff marks, 
although not as detrimental as cuts on the cover 
caused by the club face, nevertheless negatively 
affects the performance and durability of the ball. The art has made various attempts to improve the 
resistance of golf balls covers to damage caused by 
the club face. These attempts have focused on 
addition of dienes to the balata. U.S. Pat. No. 
4,984,803 adds cis-1,4 polybutadiene to balata. The 
disclosed formulations can have 5-30 phr of cis-1,4 
polybutadiene. U.S. Pat. No. 4,792,141 shows blending of 3-40 
phr of polyoctenylene rubber with 100 phr balata to 
provide improved cut resistance.
