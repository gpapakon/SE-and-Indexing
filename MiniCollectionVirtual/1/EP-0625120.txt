<ABSTRACT>
A first conveyor path (1) has a step (S) for fanning out an overlapping article stream (28). From this step (S) branches a second conveyor path (2) having a slide (6) which can be moved obliquely against the step (S). At the forward end of the slide (6) there is a pivoted flap (16) which can be swung downwards to accept and separate an individual printed product. Above the flap (16) there is an acceptance aperture (8) with a raisable clamping roller (23). The drive of this clamping roller (23) is coupled to that of the second conveyor path (2) in such a way that, when the slide (6) is moved away from the step (S), the conveying speed of the second conveyor path (2) is automatically increased. This acceleration results in the printed product to be separated being moved away from the stream (28) more quickly and over a shorter distance.
