<ABSTRACT>
A method for building up a specific thread reservoir on a rotating balloon limiter (12) of a multiple-twist twisting spindle is characterised in that the thread is guided through a thread-guide eye (13) which is arranged on the upper balloon-limiter region at an angular distance from the radial exit of the thread from the spindle rotor. A multiple-twist twisting spindle with a rotating balloon limiter (12) for carrying out the method is characterised in that the balloon limiter (12) carries in its upper region, preferably at the upper balloon-limiter edge, a thread-guide eye (13) which is located at an angular distance from the radial exit (11) of the thread from the spindle rotor.

Method of building up a thread reserve, in the case of a 
thread drawn off from a presentation bobbin which is 

seated on a bobbin carrier and guided in a thread-guiding 
channel until its emergence from the spindle rotor to a 

rotating balloon limiter of a multi-thread twisting 
spindle, characterized in that, for building up a defined 

thread reserve, the thread is guided through a thread-guiding 
loop located at an angular distance from the 

point of emergence of the thread from the spindle rotor 

in the upper region of the balloon limiter and this 
angular distance is adjusted in a range of 20° to 120° 

depending on the geometric ratios and the rotational 
speed of the spindle rotor and/or bobbin carrier, on the 

tension ratios of the thread run-off from the 
presentation bobbin and/or the properties of the thread 

material. 
Multi-thread twisting spindle with a bobbin carrier for 
the fixing of a presentation bobbin, a spindle rotor with 

a thread-guiding channel which runs in radial direction 
and a balloon limiter which can be driven in rotation as 

a thread-storage zone for the thread emerging from the 
thread-guiding channel, for implementing the method 

according to Claim 1, characterized in that the balloon 
limiter (12), in its upper region, bears a thread-guiding 

loop (13, 113, 213 or 313) which, depending on the 
geometric ratios and the rotational speed of the spindle 

rotor and/or bobbin carrier, the tension ratios of the 
thread run-off from the presentation bobbin and/or the 

properties of the thread material, bears a thread-guiding 
loop (13, 113, 213 or 313) which, in direction of rotation 

of the spindle rotor, is at an angular distance of between 
20° and 120° from the radial emergence of the thread

or 313) lying diametrically opposite one another at the 
upper edge of the balloon limiter. 
Multi-thread twisting spindle according to Claim 2,

213 or 313) has an elongated shape in direction of 
circumference of the balloon limiter (12). 
Multi-thread twisting spindle according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the thread-guiding loop (13, 113, 

213 or 313) has a length corresponding to a 
circumferential angle of 10° to 20°. 
Multi-thread twisting spindle according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that each thread-guiding loop (13, 113, 

213 or 313) is fixed on the balloon limiter (12) so as 
to be adjustable in direction of circumference. 
Multi-thread twisting spindle according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the thread-guiding loop has the 

shape of a stirrup (27) which is spring-mounted in the 
balloon limiter (12) by means of an elastically 

deformable holder (50), whereas the free end of the 
stirrup takes the form of a beak, an opening (12.1) in 

the balloon limiter (12) lying opposite this free beak-shaped 
end of the stirrup. 
Multi-thread twisting spindle according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the balloon limiter (12), or at 

least the upper edge of the balloon limiter, can be 
adjusted or twisted in relation to the radial 

emergence of the thread from the spindle rotor.
