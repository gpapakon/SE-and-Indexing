<ABSTRACT>
A low profile header assembly for an encapsulated 
instrument includes a plate member (52) with a cavity which is 

on the side of the plate member external to the 
instrument. Terminal pins (68,64) extend through the plate 

member both within the cavity and beyond its periphery. 
Hybrid amplifier circuitry (72) is disposed within the cavity 

and electrically connected to the pins within the cavity. 
The cavity is hermetically sealed and the internal 

components of the instrument are electrically connected 
to the terminal pins within the instrument shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an instrument encapsulated 
within a shell and, more particularly, to a header 
assembly including a hybrid amplifier, the header 
assembly capping the instrument shell and having a low 
profile so as to reduce the overall length of the 
instrument. U.S. Patent No. 4,621,529 discloses an angular rate 
sensor assembly instrument which includes a gyroscopic 
element having a spin axis and a flexure hinge for 
resiliently mounting the gyroscopic element to a base. 
The sensor assembly further includes a torque sensing 
assembly which has a piezoelectric beam mounted in 
coaxial relation to the spin axis. A first beam 
restraining member mounts a first edge portion of the 
piezoelectric beam to the gyroscopic element and a second 
beam restraining member mounts an opposite edge portion 
of the piezoelectric beam to the base. The piezoelectric 
beam is adapted to generate an electrical signal 
proportional to the angular velocity of the sensor 
assembly about an axis perpendicular to the spin axis. 
The entire instrument is contained within an instrument 
shell which also holds a motor for driving the gyroscopic 
element and electronic circuitry, including a buffer  
 
amplifier, to provide an output signal derived from the 
piezoelectric beam electrical signal, which output signal 
is suitable for driving electronics to which the 
instrument is connected. In recent years, there has been interest in reducing 
the overall length of such an encapsulated instrument. 
One limiting factor in the past has been the packaging of 
the buffer amplifier. Such an amplifier is typically of 
"hybrid" design, which is a mixture of discrete and 
printed circuitry within a hermetic enclosure. In the 
past, the hybrid amplifier was built up into a standard 
rectangular "flat-pack" case, with its own glassed in 
headers. This amplifier package, in turn, was bonded to 
the inside surface of a glass to metal seal header plate, 
the header plate forming an outside end of the 
hermetically sealed instrument. Electrical wires are 
soldered between the instrument's active components, the 
terminals of the flat-pack amplifier, and from these 
terminals to the inside of the instrument's glassed in 
terminal pins. Spacers are provided for the routing of 
wires around and between the flat-pack case and the 
header plate. This results in a redundant set of 
hermetic glass to metal sealed terminals, a redundant 
enclosure, and numerous flying wire leads that run 
between the amplifier and the header plate. With
