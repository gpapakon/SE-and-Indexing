<ABSTRACT>
The present invention utilizes a class of 
hydrosilation catalysts that are inhibited in the absence of 

molecular oxygen to prepare storage stable, one part curable 
compositions containing (1) compounds with alkenyl radicals 

and (2) compounds with silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms. The 
compositions are stable until exposed to molecular oxygen, 

at which time they cure in the same manner as conventional 
compositions containing these ingredients.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable compositions
that can be stored for extended periods of time in the
absence of molecular oxygen while containing a platinum-group
metal based hydrosilation catalyst which is at least
partially inhibited under anaerobic conditions. Curing of
the compositions is achieved by exposure to molecular
oxygen, which activates the catalyst and initiates curing of
the composition under either ambient conditions or with
heating.Curable compositions containing polyorganosiloxanes
or organosiloxane-modified organic polymers yield
crosslinked products ranging from flowable gels to
elastomers to resins and find use in a wide variety of
applications. These compositions can be classified based on
the reaction and the conditions used to cure the
compositions. One class of compositions cure by a
hydrosilation reaction that is catalyzed by a metal from the
platinum group of the periodic table or a compound of such a
metal. These metals include platinum, rhodium and
palladium.The advantages of a hydrosilation reaction include
the absence of moisture or excessively high temperatures to
initiate the curing reaction. The curing reaction occurs
when all of the reactants, namely an organic polymer or
polyorganosiloxane containing at least two alkenyl radicals
per molecule and a compound containing at least two silicon
bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule, are combined with the
hydrosilation catalyst under ambient conditions. The
disadvantage of this type of curable composition is its poor
storage stability. 
One method for overcoming this
disadvantage is to prepare a two part composition by
packaging the hydrosilation catalyst and the compound
containing the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in separate
containers.Another approach involves one-part curable
compositions with storage stabilities ranging from days to
months depending upon the temperature that are prepared
using known platinum catalyst inhibitors or acetylenic
compounds and amines. Alternatively, the hydrosilation
catalyst can be encapsulated in a material that is melted or
fragmented to release the catalyst when it is desired to
cure the composition. All of these methods have
disadvantages associated with them, including increased
cost, relative high curing temperature and/or extended
curing times.Patents representative of the prior art for such
curable compositions are US-A 4,578,497; US-A 4,526,954; US-A
3,249,580; US-A 3,188,300 and EP-A 0 511 882. Technical
literature also representative of this art are Lewis, L. and
Lewis, N., Chem.
