<ABSTRACT>
The valve is located in a tube section in the engine intake.It has a valve seat (4) and a closure (5). These are formed, so that during an underpressure in the tube section the closure is pressed against the seat by the underpressure. The valve seat is formed in the wall of a tubular part (2), which is inserted into the tube section. The closure forms part of an actuator (9), which mainly surrounds the tubular part. The section wall near the valve seat has a projection (13). This, together with a carrier (6) for the actuator, forms a labyrinth (12) for the turbulent air.

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine with lambda control, with a measuring means 
(4) for the aspirated air quantity and with a disturbance element which 

influences the lambda control,
 
characterised in that the disturbance element is a control valve (10) which 

feeds false air to the internal combustion engine (1) downstream of the air 
quantity measuring means (4), arranged as a spring loaded momentary 

contact switch (15, 28) which in its resting position seals the free end of an 
air line (14, 23) which ultimately opens into the intake system (2) of the 

internal combustion engine and upon actuation opens this free end. 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the control valve (10) is arranged in the intake system 

(2) of the internal combustion engine or in an air duct (9) opening into this 
intake system (2). 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the control valve (10) is formed as a branch piece (12) 

with two interconnected ports (13a, 13b) for the air duct (9), together with 
an air line (14) branching from the air duct connection (13c). 
An internal combustion engine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by at least one of the following properties: 


the momentary contact switch (15) interrupts the air duct connection (13c) 
upon actuation 
the momentary contact switch (15) is provided with a substantially pot-shaped 
momentary contact switch head (15b) 
the momentary contact switch head (15b) is pivotably-mounted in a 
momentary contact switch guide (15a)  

 
the momentary contact switch head (15b) envelops the momentary contact 
switch guide (15a) 
the air line (14) runs within the momentary contact switch guide (15a) 
a tongue (15d) secured to the branch piece (12) bears a sealing plate (15e) 
which works together with the momentary contact switch head (15b) and 

thereby opens/closes the free end of the air line (14). 
An internal combustion engine according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the control valve (10) is arranged in a line section (21) 

connected to the intake system of the internal combustion engine and is 
provided with a sealing element (25) which can be lifted off a valve seat 

(24) against the force of a spring element (31) and in its elevated position 
facilitates the passage of disturbance air into the line section (21), with the 

sealing element (25) and the valve seat (24) formed such that if there is a 
partial vacuum in the line section (21) then the sealing element (25) lying on 

the valve seat (24) is pressed against the valve seat (24) by the partial 
vacuum. 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that the valve seat (24) is substantially worked out of the 

wall of a pipe section (22) which can be inserted at least on one side into 
the line section (21). 
An internal combustion engine according to either claim 5 or claim 6,
 
characterised in that the sealing element (25) is a constituent part of an 

actuation element (29) which substantially envelops the pipe section (22) 
and is provided with a momentary contact switch (28) arranged on the side 

opposite the sealing element (25) relative to the pipe section (22) as a 
further constituent part. 
An internal combustion engine according to any one of claims 5 to 7,
  
 

characterised in that the wall of the pipe section (22) close to the valve seat 
(24) is provided with a projection (23) which, together with a support part 

(26) of the actuation element (29), forms a labyrinth (32) for the disturbance 
air. 
An internal combustion engine according to any one of claims 5 to 8,
 
characterised in that the support part (26) is connected to the momentary 

contact switch (28) via a snap-on connection for which a supporting rib (35) 
is provided. 
An internal combustion engine according to any one of claims 5 to 9,
 
characterised in that the arms (27) of the support part (26) forming the 

snap-on connection are guided in guides (34) worked out of the pipe section 
(22). 
An internal combustion engine with lambda control, with a measuring means 
(4) for the aspirated air quantity and with a disturbance element which 

influences the lambda control,
 
characterised in that the disturbance element is a control valve (10) which 

changes the pressure in the fuel supply system (8) and is in the form of a 

spring-loaded momentary contact switch (15) which only provides the 
desired disturbance in the fuel supply system (8) upon actuation. 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 11,
 
characterised in that the control valve (10) is arranged within a fuel line (8d, 

8f) or a fluid control line (8e) leading to a fuel pressure controller (8b).
