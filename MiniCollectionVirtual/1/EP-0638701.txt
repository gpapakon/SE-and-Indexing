<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pinching-prevention means for power-operated closure devices, in particular electrically operated windows and sun roofs of motor vehicles, having two spaced-apart electric conductors which, when brought into contact, trigger a switching operation with respect to the drive unit. In the case of said pinching-prevention means, the invention provides, for simple production and reliable contacting, that the pinching-prevention means comprises an elastic hollow profile (10) which consists of an elastomer or plastic and exhibits a planar base region (11) and an attached, convex profile region (12) with the inclusion of a hollow chamber (16), and that the base region (11) and vertex region (13) of the convex profile region (12) consist of a conductive material, said two regions being separated from one another by insulating profile regions (14, 15).

A trapping protector for electric-powered windows and sunroofs on
motor vehicles including an extruded elastomer hollow profile (10)

comprising a hollow chamber and two electrical conductors spaced away
from each other which on being brought into contact activate a switching

action as regards a drive assembly of the closing device, said electrical
conductors being configured as conductive portions (11, 12) in said

hollow profile (10) by the addition of conductive substances to said
elastomer material, a conductive flat base portion (11) and a mounted

curved profile portion (12) being provided, forming with said base portion
(11) said hollow chamber and comprising a zenith portion (13) of

conductive material separated by insulating profile portions (14, 15) from
said base portion (11), characterized in that said hollow profile (10) is

configured integrally as a coextrudate with a window guide profile (36) for
sealing and guiding said window, said hollow profile (10) being connected

to a side leg of said window guide profile (36) and further characterized in
that a metallic conductor (20, 21) is embedded by co
extrusion in each
conductive portion (11, 12).
The trapping protector as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that
said non-conductive rubber of said leg (37) is directly continued as the

sheathing (42) of said conductive base portion (11).
The trapping protector as set forth in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that on the inner side of said hollow chamber each of said conductive

portions (11, 12) comprises a protuberance jutting into said hollow
chamber.
The trapping protector as set forth in any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that in downswept corner portions (8) of said profile

portion the juxtaposing ends of said hollow profiles (10, 10') are slip-mounted
on a correspondingly downswept insertion contact with said

cross-section of said hollow chamber and in that said insertion contact 
(45) comprises on its upper and lower sides conductive layers (46, 47)

separated in the middle by an insulating layer (48).
The trapping protector as set forth in any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a terminal contact (50) is provided for said electric

connection comprising at one end a cross-section corresponding to that of
said hollow chamber of said hollow profile (10) and translating at the other

end into a block-shaped end piece (53) from which two contact pins (51,
52) protrude and in that said terminal contact (50) comprises on its upper

and lower sides conductive layers (46, 47) separated in their middle by an
insulating layer (48).
The trapping protector as set forth in any of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that a terminal contact (55) is provided for said electric

connection comprising at one end a cross-section corresponding to that of
said hollow chamber of said hollow profile (10) and translating at the other

end into a block-shaped end piece (58) from which two contact pins (51,
52) protrude and in that said block-shaped end piece (58) comprises on its

rear side two contact tips (56, 57) in contact with said metallic
conductors (21, 22) of said hollow profile (10).
The trapping protector as set forth in any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that carbon black, graphite or metal powder is employed

as conductive substances.
