<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a drawer front having a front panel (12) 
and a 

pull (14) attached thereto. The front panel has a front wall (16) with a 
top flange (20) extending 

rearwardly from a top portion of the front wall and a back flange (24) 
extending 

downward from the top flange. The pull has a generally inverted 
J-shaped cross-section. 

The pull has a front portion (50) for a user to grasp with his fingers 
and a rear 

portion spaced apart from the front portion. A middle portion 
interconnects the front 

portion and the rear portion. A locking element (44) is attached to one 
of the back flange 

of the front panel and the rear portion of the pull. A first aperture 
is located on the 

other of the back flange of the front panel and the rear portion of the 
pull. The 

locking element mates with the first aperture to thereby secure 
the pull to the front panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of file cabinet
drawers and desk drawers. More particularly, the invention relates to the field of
drawer pulls for use with the drawers of file cabinets, desks and the like.File cabinet drawers and desk drawers are often designed with an
integral drawer pull. However, the use of an integral drawer pull limits a
manufacturer's ability to configure the pull shape and material to the particular
aesthetic requirements of a user. Furthermore, the manufacture of an integral drawer
pull can be a difficult process.One type of drawer pull has been constructed for use with an aperture
within the front panel of a drawer. For example, US-A-3,098,686 issued
to R.A. Benoit discloses a drawer pull for use in a recess or cavity in a drawer front.
A box-shaped section is shaped around an aperture in the drawer front in order to
form an enclosure that secures the drawer pull. The drawer pull has a curved body
that fits within the cavity of the drawer front. Two oppositely extending detent
portions extend from the pull in order to mate with two spaced apart flanges
extending from the front of the drawer.Similarly, US-A-3,646,634 issued to Fusselman discloses a
pull for use inside an aperture in the front panel of a drawer. A box-shaped housing
with an open-top is attached to the rear surface of the front panel. A J-shaped trim
element is attached to the upper edge of the aperture. A pair of locking tabs on the
trim element mate with a downwardly extending lip from the upper edge of the
aperture to thereby secure the trim element to the front panel.One disadvantage of these types of devices is that these pulls require
that an aperture be cut in the front panel of the drawer thereby adding complexity to
the manufacturing process and detracting from the appearance of the drawer.
Furthermore, the additional structure of a box-shaped housing may be necessary to
enclose the aperture in the front panel. Another disadvantage of these pulls is that 
the length of these pulls is limited to the size of the corresponding aperture. Thus,
a user has a much more limited space in which to grab the pull.Therefore, a simple and more versatile drawer pull is needed.In accordance with a first aspect of the present
invention there is provided a drawer front having a
front panel and a pull attached thereto. The front
panel has a front wall with a top flange extending
rearwardly from a top portion of the front wall and a
back flange extending downward from the top flange.
The pull has a

A drawer front comprising: a front panel (12)
having a front wall (16) with a top flange (20)

extending rearwardly from a top portion (22) of said
front wall (16) and a back flange (24) extending

downward from said top flange (20) ; and a pull (14)
having a generally inverted J-shaped cross-section

being attached to said front panel (12) which
comprises a front portion (50) for a user to grasp

with his fingers, a rear portion (54) spaced apart
from said front portion (50) , a middle portion (52)

interconnecting said front portion (50) and said rear
portion (54) , and a locking element (44) attached to

one of said back flange (24) of said front panel (12)
and said rear portion (54) of said pull (14) and a

first aperture (40) on the other of said back flange
(24) of said front panel (12) and said rear portion

(54) of said pull (14) whereby said locking element
(44) passes through said first aperture (40) to

thereby secure said pull (14) to said front panel
(12) .
The drawer front of claim 1 wherein said locking
element (44) extends from
 said rear portion (54) of
said pull (14) and said first aperture (40) is within

said back flange (24) of said front panel (12) .
The drawer front of claim 2 wherein said locking
element (44) comprises a first extension (60) that

passes through said first aperture (40) of said back
flange (24) of said front panel (12) and is releasably

secured to said back flange (24) of said front panel
(12) . 
The drawer front of claim 3 wherein said first
extension (60) has a downwardly angled first surface

(62) extending from said rear portion (54) of said
pull (14), a vertically extending second surface (64)

depending from a bottom edge of said first surface
(62) and a downwardly angled third surface (66)
