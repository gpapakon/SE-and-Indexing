<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a pram/pushchair or dolls pram with a foldable scissor-like frame (10) which has two scissor parts (12, 14) which are each constructed with a pair of lateral leg elements (16). The two scissor parts (12, 14) are connected to each other in a manner which allows them to pivot about a folding hinge (20) and are provided for holding wheels (18). Situated between the wheels (18) is a basket (22) which is connected to the leg elements (16) of the two scissor parts (12, 14) by means of fastening members (24, 26). Each fastening member (24, 26) has a connecting point (28) which is parallel to the folding hinge (20) and by means of which the basket (22) is connected to the corresponding fastening member (24, 26). At least the fastening members (24) of one of the two scissor parts (12, 14) are arranged such that they can be displaced linearly along the two associated, lateral leg elements (16).

<CLAIMS>
A child's or doll's pushchair with a foldable scissor-type 
frame (10) which has two scissor parts (12, 14) with one 

pair of lateral arm elements (16) each, in which arrangement, 
the two scissor parts (12, 14) are connected to each other for 

a pivoting movement round a common pivot pin (20) and serve 
for the mounting of wheels (18) between which a basket (22) is 

provided,
characterized in that
 
the basket (22) is connected to the arm elements (16) of the 

scissor parts (12, 14) by means of securing elements (24, 26), 
in which arrangement each securing element (24, 26) has a 

joint pin (28) parallel to the pivot pin (20) of the scissor-type 
frame (10), by means of which joint pin, the basket (22) 

is connected to the corresponding securing element (24, 26), 
and at least the securing elements (24) of one of the two 

scissor parts (12, 14) are arranged for linear displacement 
along the two associated lateral arm elements (16). 
A pushchair according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the two securing elements (26) associated with one scissor 

part (12) are linearly immovable on the corresponding lateral 
arm elements (16) of this scissor part (12) and that the two 

securing elements (24) associated with the second scissor part 
(14) are designed to be linearly displaceable on the corresponding 

lateral arm elements (16) of the said second scissor 
part (14). 
A pushchair according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the two securing elements (24, 26) associated with one scissor 

part (12) and the two securing elements (24) associated with 
the second scissor part (14) are designed to be linearly 

displaceable on the corresponding lateral arm elements (16) of 
the two scissor parts (12, 14).  

 
A pushchair according to claim 3,
characterized in that
 
in each case, at least one lateral arm element (16) of each of 

the two scissor parts (12, 14) is designed with a limiting 
device (34) limiting the scope for linear displacement of the 

associated securing elements (24). 
A pushchair according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
each securing element (24, 26) has a sleeve element (38) 

through which there extends the associated arm element (16), 
and that the joint pin (28) associated with the basket (22) is 

designed for a pivoting movement on the corresponding sleeve 
element (38). 
A pushchair according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
the joint pin (28) of the respective securing element (24, 26) 

is offset against the associated arm element (16).
