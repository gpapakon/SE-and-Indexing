<ABSTRACT>
In this system with instant allocation of zone calls, the traffic of persons between at least one main stop (HH) and zones in a high building is managed via an elevator system (ABC) consisting of, for example, three elevators (A; B; C). The traffic of persons filling the building, which arrives at the main stop (HH), is symbolised by arrows (P0; P1...Pn) pointing to the elevator group (ABC). The traffic of persons leaving the building, which arrives at the main stop (HH) is symbolised by arrows (Pa) pointing away from the elevator group (ABC). Each elevator user filling the building passes a gate (G0; G1...Gn) allocated to one zone, in which a sensor (S0; S1...Sn) registers the elevator user. The elevator user conveys his desired zone by choosing the appropriate gate (G0; G1...Gn) without manual operation of a call registration device of the elevator control. The signals of the sensors (S0; S1...Sn) are forwarded to the control devices of the elevators (A; B; C) which, in turn, inform the elevator user, before he leaves the gate (G0; G1...Gn), about the respective allocated elevator by means of a display device (D0; D1...Dn).

<CLAIMS>
Lift installation for zonal operation in a high building with at least
one zone (Z0; Z1 to Zn), with at least one main stopping place (HH) and with a

lift group (ABC), which consists of at least two lifts (A; B; C) and in which
the lift cages of the lifts (A; B; C) consist of at least one compartment and

manage the passenger traffic between the main stopping place (HH) and the zones
(Z0; Z1 to Zn), wherein a call registering equipment is provided for registering

the journeys desired by the lift users into the zones (Z0; Z1 to Zn) and wherein
the relevant zone calls are immediately allocated for execution to the lift (A;

B; C) with the best possible travelling conditions by a control equipment and
wherein the lift (A; B; C) executing the desired journey is immediately made

known to the lift user visually by an indicating equipment after the selection
of the desired zone, characterised in that a gateway (G0; G1 to Gn), which is

actuable hands off, is provided for each zone (Z0; Z1 to Zn), wherein a sensor
(S0; S1 to Sn) for detection of the lift users of the desired zone (Z0; Z1 to

Zn) and an indicating device (D0; D1 to Dn) are arranged at each gateway (G0; G1
to Gn).
Lift installation according to claim 1, characterised in that light
barriers, turnstiles, load pick-ups, infrared detectors, inductively or

capacitively operating detectors, cameras, detectors operating on the radar
principle or other equipment detecting the lift passenger are provided as

sensors (S0; S1 to Sn).
Lift installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the
equipment for registering the desired journeys comprises a call-registering

equipment (9), in which contacts (K0, K1 to Kn) belonging to the sensors (S0; S1
to Sn) stand in connection with inputs (S) of call storage devices (27.0; 27.1

to 27.n) and outputs (Q) of the call storage devices (27.0; 27.1 to 27.n) are
connected with inputs of a multiplexer (28) and an OR-member (29), the output of

which is connected to the first input of the multiplexer (28), which is
connected with an address bus (AB) of a microcomputer system (5), wherein the 

outputs (Q) of the call storage devices (27.0; 27.1 to 27.n) are connected by
way of lines (11) with the multiplexers (28) and the OR-members of the remaining

lifts (B; C).
Lift installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the
indicating equipments (D0; D1 to Dn) are connected by way of further control

circuits (71; 72; 80) with microcomputer systems (5a, 5b; 5c) associated with
the lifts (A; B; C), wherein a further control circuit (71) consists of three

address decoders (74), three monoflops (75) and three AND-members (76) each
having two inputs and that the other further control circuits (72; 80) consist

of three AND-members (78; 81) and the address decoders (74) are each connected
at the input with a respective address bus (AB) and a block release line (ce) of

the associated microcomputer systems (5a; 5b; 5c) and that the address decoders
(74) stand in connection at the output side with the inputs of the monoflops

(75), the outputs of which are each connected to a respective input of the AND-members
(76; 78; 81), wherein the other inputs of the AND-members (76; 78; 81)

are connected with the sensors (S0; S1 to Sn) by way of release lines (L0; L1 to
Ln).
Lift installation according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the microcomputer system (5) consists of a main stopping place storage

device (RAM1), a zone call storage device (RAM2), a respective costs storage
device (RAM4) for the upward and the downward direction of travel, a respective

allocation storage device (RAM5) for the upward and downward direction of
travel, scanners (R1; R2), a selector (R3), a program storage device (EPROM) and

a microprocessor (CPU), which is connected by way of the address bus (AB), a
data bus (DB) and a control bus (STB) with the storage device (RAM1 to RAM5;

EPROM).
Lift installation according to claim 5, characterised in that the zone
call storage device (RAM2) consists of a first storage device (RAM2'), which has

storage places corresponding to the number of the zones and in which already
allocated calls are stored, and that the zone call storage device (RAM2)

associated with the zones (Z0; Z1 to Zn) and likewise have storage places

corresponding to the number of the zones (Z0; Z1 to Zn), into which storage
places are transferred those detected zone calls which have not yet been

allocated to a specific lift cage.
