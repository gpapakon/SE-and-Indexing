<ABSTRACT>
This arterial blood monitoring system takes advantage of the basic 
statistical property that arterial blood contains a plurality of dominant 

absorbers, whose measured light absorption spectra appear as a constant 
over a short interval of time. By measuring the transmitted light as it 

varies with arterial pulsation at selected wavelengths of light, over a 
common light path, the relative amount of these dominant absorbers in the 

arterial blood can noninvasively be determined. To ensure the common light 
path, a sandwich construction light detector is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to non-invasive photoplethysmographic measurement of
blood analytes and, in particular, to a probe for use in an arterial blood
monitoring system to measure more accurately the change in intensity of the
light transmitted through the arterial blood of a patient.A Probe according to the preamble of present claim 1 is known from
GB-A- 1325039.It is a problem in the field of medical monitoring equipment to measure
accurately various parameters of arterial blood in a noninvasive manner.
For example, the oxygen saturation (SaO2) of the hemoglobin in arterial
blood is determined by the relative proportions of oxygenated hemoglobin
and reduced hemoglobin in the arterial blood. A pulse oximeter system
noninvasively determines the oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin by
measuring the difference in the light absorption of these two forms of
hemoglobin. Reduced hemoglobin absorbs more light in the red band (600 -
800nm) than does oxyhemoglobin while oxyhemoglobin absorbs more light in
the near infrared band (800 - 1000nm) than does reduced hemoglobin.The pulse oximeter includes a probe that is placed in contact with the
skin, either on a flat surface in the case of reflectance probes or across
some appendage in the case of a transmission probe. The probe contains two
light emitting diodes, each of which emits a beam of light at a specific
wavelength, one in the red band and one in the infrared band. The
magnitude of red and infrared light transmitted through the intervening
appendage contains a non- pulsatile component which is influenced by the
absorbency of tissue, venous blood, capillary blood, non-pulsatile arterial
blood, and the intensity of the light source. The pulsatile component of
the received signals is an indication of the expansion of the arteriolar
bed in the appendage with arterial blood. The effects of different tissue
thicknesses and skin pigmentation in the appendage can be removed from the
received signals by normalizing the change in intensity of the received
signal by the absolute intensity of the received signal. Taking the ratio
of the mathematically processed and normalized red and infrared signals
results in a number which is theoretically a function of only the
concentration of oxyhemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin in the arterial 
blood. This assumes that oxyhemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin are the only
substantial absorbers in the arterial blood.The amplitude of the pulsatile component is a very small percentage of the
total signal amplitude and depends on the
