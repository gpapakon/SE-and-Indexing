<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmitter transmitting blocks to a receiver by means of frames formed by a latching line and data lines, and receiving an acknowledgement from this receiver sent by the latter on recognition of a latching line. A block comprising control bits (C1 to C4), information bits (d1 to d125) and matching bits (C5 to C11), during a first phase preceding the reception of this acknowledgement the receiver transmits blocks in which the matching bits (C5 to C11) have been deleted by means of reduced frames comprising an initial number of data lines and, during a second phase following on from reception of this acknowledgement, it transmits blocks incorporating these matching bits (C5 to C11) by means of complete frames comprising a final number of data lines which is higher than this initial number. The invention also relates to a receiver suitable for receiving blocks sent by such a transmitter, this receiver comprising analysis means for determining whether the blocks received are carried by a reduced frame or by a complete frame so as to identify the nature of these blocks.
