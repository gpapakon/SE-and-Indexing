<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to improvements in
pharmaceutical compositions and in particular improvements
in pharmaceutical compositions used in chemotherapy.A number of anti-neoplastic agents currently are in use
in chemotherapy (see generally "Cutting's Handbook of Pharmacology,
7th Ed., Chapter 13, Cs√°ky and Barnes) and many
additional agents are under investigation.Because of their often complex structure, these agents
can exhibit low stability in the blood stream. Many are
extremely insoluble and possess poor transport properties
with respect to cell membranes. In addition, binding of the
anti-neoplastic agent with plasma proteins, as well as other
nonspecific interactions in the blood stream prior to its
reaching its target, can greatly reduce the effective amount
actually available to combat the neoplastic cells. Moreover,
multidrug resistance often is observed with such
agents; i.e., the sensitivity of the neoplastic cells to the
agent is observed to decrease, often by a factor of 103,
over the course of treatment and this resistance thereafter
may manifest itself even with respect to structurally different
anti-neoplastic agents.In accordance with the present invention, the anti-neoplastic
agent of choice (which may include a mixture of several
distinct anti-neoplastic agents) is incorporated into a
micelle of a block copolymer of poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxypropylene)
in an aqueous dispersion as hereinafter
described.The use of the block copolymer micelle in administrating
the anti-neoplastic agent provides non-covalent solubilization
which reduces water-instability and increases the 
solubility of the anti-neoplastic agent.Moreover, while block copolymers of poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxypropylene)
have been used as nonionic surfactants,
the effects observed here clearly extend beyond mere solubilization.
For example, undesired pretarget protein binding
of the anti-neoplastic agent is reduced; i.e., the anti-neoplastic
agent appears to be "shielded" from proteins which
otherwise would bind to it. Increased sensitivity with
respect to the target anti-neoplastic cells also is
observed. Finally a reversion in multidrug resistance is
observed. While the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon
is not fully understood, it is accompanied by an overexpression
of a transmembrane P-glycoprotein of Mr about 170
kD (P-170) which mediates the ATP-dependent efflux of numerous
drugs from such cells (although drug efflux may involve
other membrane components of MDR cells as well). The present
compositions appear
