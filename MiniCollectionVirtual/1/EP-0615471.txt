<ABSTRACT>
The sonic or ultrasonic transducer described includes a piezoceramic disc (10), which can be excited to oscillate in the radial directions and a metal ring (16) which surrounds the piezoceramic disc (10) with which it physically and frictionally interlocks so that it oscillates radially with the disc. The sonic or ultrasonic transducer thus formed has a surface area represented by the total surface area of the piezoceramic disc plus metal ring and a resonant frequency for radial oscillation which is lower than that of the piezoceramic disc alone.

<CLAIMS>
A sonic or ultrasonic transducer comprising a circular 
piezo-ceramic disk (10) capable of being excited to radial 

oscillations, and a metal ring (16) surrounding the piezo-ceramic 
disk, characterised in that the metal ring embraces 

in tight close fitting relationship the circumferential 
surface of the piezo-ceramic disk to form a radial 

oscillator in conjunction with the disk. 
A sonic or ultrasonic transducer according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the metal ring (16) is secured to the 

piezo-ceramic disk (10) by having been shrunk on. 
A sonic or ultrasonic transducer according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that the metal ring (16) is composed of 

aluminium. 
A sonic or ultrasonic transducer according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that an adaptive 

layer (18) is applied onto the one end face of the radial 
oscillator formed by the piezo-ceramic disk (10) and the 

metal ring (16).
