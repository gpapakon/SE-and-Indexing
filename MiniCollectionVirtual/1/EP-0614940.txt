<ABSTRACT>
A modified thermoplastic resin or elastomer 
composition having excellent paint adhesion is obtained 

by dynamically heat-treating a peroxide-crosslinkable 
olefin type copolymer and/or an olefin type plastic and 

a monomer containing at least one amino group and/or an 
unsaturated carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof in 

the presence of an organic peroxide. This thermoplastic 
resin or elastoemr composition is valuable as a material 

for an interior automotive trim. If a layer of this 
thermoplastic elastomer composition is laminated with a 

polyurethane layer, a laminate having excellent tensile 
strength and heat resistance, which is especially 

valuable as an interior trim of a vehicle such as an 
automobile, is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic
elastomer composition which has excellent
paint adhesion and excellent bondability to, for example, a metal
and which has excellent rubbery
elasticity, moldability and heat resistance, and to a process
for preparing said composition.It has been known that a thermoplastic elastomer is
a cured rubber substitute of the energy-saving and 
resource-saving type.As the thermoplastic elastomer of this type, there
is known, for example, an olefin type thermoplastic
elastomer composed mainly of an ethylene/propylene/uncojugated
diene copolymer rubber. Although this
elastomer has excellent performances as a
thermoplastic elastomer, the paint adhesion and the
bondability to various resins or metals are
insufficient, and therefore the application range of
this thermoplastic elastomer is extremely restricted.An attempt has been made to improve the bondability of
this thermoplastic elastomer by modifying the above-mentioned
rubber component with, for example, maleic anhydride.
However, in this case, characteristics such as
the rubbery elasticity and moldability are drastically
degraded, though the bondability is improved.JP-A-5927935 relates to a thermoplastic elastomer composition
having good bondability to polyurethane foams comprising
25-200 pts/wt of a polyolefin resin blended with 100 pts/wt of
a mixture consisting of a partially crosslinked ethylene/α-olefin
copolymer rubber and an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer rubber having
carboxyl groups or its anhydride groups.Even at present, the paint adhesion and the
bondability to various resins or metals are similarly
insufficient in thermoplastic resins such as
polyolefins.Namely, a thermoplastic resin or elastomer which not only has
excellent
rubbery elasticity and moldability characteristics but also excellent paint
adhesion and bondability to various resins and
metals is not known.A polyvinyl chloride sheet having on the surface a
leather pattern formed by embossing the surface and
boarding the embossed surface has been heretobefore used
for interior automotive trims such as a floor, a wall
and a roof.However, since a plasticizer is incorporated in
polyvinyl chloride per se, this polyvinyl chloride sheet
is defective in that the surface becomes soft and
sticky, and, by evaporation of the plasticizer, the sheet
is made rigid or the atmosphere in an automobile becomes 
blurred.A laminate formed by backing a polyvinyl chloride
sheet with a formed layer and, if necessary, further
with a resin aggregate layer has been used
