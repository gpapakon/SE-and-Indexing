<ABSTRACT>
In a milling cutter with polygonal cutting tips (7 to 10) distributed over the periphery and arranged in various radial planes, the contours of the cutting tips overlap axially in the axial machining plane, and the contours of at least the cutting tips (7 to 10) lying in the front adjacent radial planes in the axial direction overlap radially in the axial machining plane, and the cutting edges (14 to 17) of the cutting tips (7 to 10) are rectilinear between the corners of the cutting tips. This design enables the milling cutter to be used as a roughing tool with high cutting capacity and long service life of the cutting tips.

Spherical head milling tool with multi-edged cutting plates (7 to 10; 

34 to 51) which are arranged distributed at the circumference and in 
different planes and the profiles of which axially overlap in the axial 

processing plane, wherein the profiles of at least the cutting plates (7 
to 10; 34 to 37; 43, 44, 47 to 49) lying in the adjacent radial planes at 

the front in axial direction radially overlap in the axial processing 
plane and the cutting edges of the cutting plates (7 to 10; 34 to 51) are 

rectilinear between the corners thereof, characterised thereby that the 
cutting edges, which come into processing action, of the cutting plates 

(7, 8; 35, 36, 40, 43, 47, 49) lying in the adjacent radial planes at 
the front in axial direction overlap a plurality of times in the axial 

processing plane.
