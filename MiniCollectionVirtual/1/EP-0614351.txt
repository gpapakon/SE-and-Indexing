<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to suspending agents for
silicone oil conditioning shampoos,
which suspending agents are formed by reacting long-chain
alkyl ammonium salts with anionic surfactants.This prior art is replete with emulsions for a myriad of
uses. Among the numerous applications for emulsions are
fabric softeners, surface cleaners, agricultural chemical
mixtures, skin cleansers, creams and lotions, car wax
formulations, textile lubricants, and antiperspirant
formulations.These emulsions are the type wherein a liquid is
dispersed in at least one insoluble liquid. Such emulsions
include oil-in-water, water-in-oil, oil-in-water-in-a second
oil, water-in-oil-in-a second oil, and oil-in-a second oil
emulsions. These emulsions typically include oils such as
crude petroleum oil, distilled petroleum oil, heavy
paraffinic oil, asphaltene oil, linseed oil, tall oil,
soybean oil alkyd, linseed oil alkyd, mineral oil,
petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl myristate,
caprylic/capric triglyceride, lanolin, acetylated lanolin
alcohol, silicone compounds such as dimethicone and
cyclomethicone, hydrogenated vegetable oil, sesame oil,
safflower oil, avocado oil, glycerine, propylene glycol,
sorbitol, C12-C16 alcohol benzoates, cocoa butter, vitamin E
acetate, squalene, sodium pyrolidone carboxylic acid, methyl
glucose ether, panthenol, melanin, and mixtures thereof.Exemplary emulsions are shampoo and conditioner
compositions. The prior art is also replete with shampoo and
conditioner emulsions. Such emulsions are widely used
because human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the
surrounding atmosphere and, to a greater extent, from sebum
secreted by the head. The build-up of the sebum causes the
hair to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. 
The soiling of the hair necessitates its being shampooed with
frequent regularity.Shampooing the hair cleans by removing soil and sebum.
However, the shampooing process is disadvantageous because
the process results in hair that is left in a wet, tangled
and generally unmanageable state. A variety of approaches
have been developed to alleviate these after-shampoo
problems. These approaches range from the inclusion of hair
conditioning aids in shampoos to post-shampoo application of
hair conditioners, i.e., hair rinses. Post shampoo hair
rinses or conditioners typically work by depositing a
polymeric film or other material onto the hair. However, the
use of solutions of such material as conditioners has not
been fully satisfactory. For one thing, hair rinses
