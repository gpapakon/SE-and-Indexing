<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
measuring internal information of a scattering medium.
In embodiments of the invention pulsed light, square wave
light, or continuous light is made incident on a
scattering medium such as a living body, and detecting
light propagating in the scattering medium and more
particularly, to a method for measuring internal
information in a scattering medium and an apparatus for
the same, which are capable of measuring an absolute
value of an absorption coefficient and a transport
scattering coefficient of the scattering medium, the
concentration of a specific absorptive constituent in the
scattering medium, its time change, it spatial
distribution, and the others, and which are capable of
improving measurement precision.Demands for precise measurement of an absorption
coefficient or a transport scattering coefficient in a
scattering medium such as a living body or the precise
measurement of the concentration of a specific absorptive
constituent are very strong, and there are 
several reports and attempts therefore. Main prior
arts will be represented as references1-5) at the end of
this section. Note that the number of each reference
will be referred to with a superscriptX) hereinafter.In general, since light is scattered and/or
absorbed at random in the scattering medium, light
does not propagate straight. For the scattering
medium in which the absorption is zero, a total
quantity of light never decreases, but since light is
scattered by scattering constituents at random, light
propagates zigzag. In this case, a distance that
light can propagate without the effect of the
scattering is called a mean free path or a mean
diffusion length, which is an inverse of a transport
scattering coefficient µs'. In the case of the living
body specimen, the mean free path is about 2 mm1). In
addition, the scattering medium comprises absorptive
constituents other than the scattering constituents,
so that the absorption occurs in accordance with a
distance that light propagates while scattering, and
the quantity of light is exponentially attenuated in
accordance with the distance.As the prior arts in the field of the precise
measurement of an absorption coefficient or a
transport scattering coefficient of a scattering
medium, one is to measure quantity of transmitted 
light or reflected light corresponding to continuous
light or pulsed light incidence, and one is to measure
transmitted light or reflected light corresponding to
pulsed light incidence and to analyze its waveform.
