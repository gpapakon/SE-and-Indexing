<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a gelled hypochlorite-based cleaner in 
which stability is achieved by reducing or minimizing the ionic strength of the 

cleaner, comprising: 

(a) a cross-linked polyacrylate polymer; 
(b) an amount of an bleach-stable surfactant sufficient, in 
combination with said polyacrylate polymer, to result in a gel; 
(c) an effective amount of a source of hypochlorite, which has an 
ionic strength below about 5M; and 
(d) the balance, water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gelled hypochlorite bleach-containing
cleaners for use as hard surface cleaners.Thickened hypochlorite bleach solutions or compositions have
long been used in a variety of applications including hard surface cleaning,
disinfecting and the like. These compositions are typically provided with
increased viscosity for a number of reasons, principally to increase residence
time of the composition on non-horizontal surfaces.Many different examples of thickened hypochlorite bleach
compositions have been available from a wide variety of sources for use in
hard surface cleaning. For example, Finley et al., European Patent
Application EP 373,864 and Prince et al., U.S. Patent 5,130,043, disclosed
hypochlorite bleach compositions consisting of polyacrylate thickeners, amine
oxide detergent, and optional fatty acid soap and/or a bleach stable synthetic
anionic detergent for cleaning hard surfaces such as toilet bowls, bathroom
tiles and shower walls. However, both of these references do not disclose,
teach or suggest the need to reduce or limit the free electrolyte, or ionic
strength, of thickened cleaners.Other prior art references have also described various thickened
automatic dish washing liquid compositions using polyacrylates in combination
with colloidal thickeners to provide proper rheology and stability in
hypochlorite bleach compositions including various adjuncts. Stoddart, U.S.
Patent 4,576,728, and Corring, U.S. Patent 4,836,948, are representative of
these other prior art references. These types of cleaners contain large
amounts of builders, or other materials, which would boost the ionic strength
of the resulting composition. Also, as automatic dish washing compositions
(or, "ADWD's"), such cleaners typically must include silicates as overglaze
protectors and contain relatively low amounts of surfactants, if at all, to
prevent high foaming action. A related application,
which falls under
A. 54(3) EPC,
EP-A-606707 discloses hypochlorite compositions generally
having a maximum thickness of less than a gel and which is intended for spray dispensers,
in which polyacrylate is used primarily as an odor controlling agent to prevent or minimize
the volatilization of hypochlorite solution as it is dispensed from the spray dispenser.Generally, these compositions have performed satisfactorily for their intended
purpose. However, there is a need for thickened gel hypochlorite bleach composition
offering improved characteristics and benefits.Reference may also be made to the
