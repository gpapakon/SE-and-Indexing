<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle useful in a 
paste for electronics applications. More particularly, 
this invention relates to an improved liquid vehicle for 
suspending inorganic particles for use in thick film and 
solder paste applications. The electronics industry uses particulate-based 
high-solids pastes in a variety of applications to 
ultimately provide conductive or dielectric capability 
in an electronic component. These pastes typically 
contain inorganic particles and an organic medium or 
vehicle. The inorganic particles provide the electrical 
functionality in the ultimate application, i.e., 
insulative or non-conducting inorganic particles form 
dielectric parts and conductive inorganic particles, 
primarily metals, form conductive parts. The organic 
medium facilitates application and control of the 
location of the inorganic particles. After application of the paste, the organic medium 
is removed by heating and the inorganic particles are 
sintered or reflowed to form the electrically functional 
part. To apply the paste to the desired locations in 
the desired patterns, it is necessary that the paste 
flow well with the application method employed, such as 
stencil or screen printing, pressure dispensing etc. A flow modifying agent or agents is typically 
included in the paste formulation for the paste to have 
the appropriate rheology or flow characteristics. 
Particularly desirable rheological characteristics of  
 
the paste include high viscosity, which precludes 
separation or settling of the inorganic particulate in 
the paste, dripping, stringiness, and slumping or 
sagging; plastic flow, which provides shear thinning 
with a well defined yield point for improved printing 
characteristics; sufficient tackiness to hold 
components; good transfer through the printing pattern; 
and clean release from the screen or stencil. Effective amounts of flow modifiers, other organic 
ingredients, and acidic and/or basic activators, are 
typically so high that the organic ingredients leave a 
substantial residue on the solder after reflow. For 
example, rosin is typically present in a solder paste in 
the amount of by weight 25% or greater by weight in a 
solder paste vehicle. For thick film paste, ethyl 
cellulose, as a flow modifier, is typically present in 
the amount of 1-3% by weight of the paste. This amount 
of flow modifier leaves a substantial, readily visible 
and potentially solder-coating residue. It is necessary 
to wash off the residues since the residues contain 
various
