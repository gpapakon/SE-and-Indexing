<ABSTRACT>
An inducible promoter is used to regulate expression of a gene which is known to be critical to male fertility. The selected gene's control sequences are modified so that it is normally "off" and as a result the plants are male sterile. When it is desired to reproduce the male sterile plants, male fertility is restored by treating the plants with a non-phytotoxic chemical which induces expression of the critical gene. A critical gene is one which affects flavonol production and in particular compounds of formula (I), wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R7, and R8 are hydrogen, hydroxyl or alkoxy having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred flavonols include galangin, kaempferol, iso-rhamnetin, quercetin and morin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of microsporogenesis genes and inducible promoters for the production of hybrid seed. In particular, it relates to regulating male sterility of such seed by controlling nucleic acid sequences affecting flavonol production.The goal of plant breeding is to combine in a single variety/hybrid various' desirable traits of the parental lines. For field crops, these traits may include resistance to diseases and insects, tolerance to heat and drought, reducing the time to crop maturity, greater yield, and better agronomic quality. With mechanical harvesting of many crops, uniformity of plant characteristics such as germination and stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size, is important.Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method of pollination. A plant is self-pollinating if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant.Plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type for many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny. A cross between two homozygous lines produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that may be heterozygous for many gene loci. A cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of gene loci will produce a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and will not be uniform.Maize plants (ZeamaysL.) can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination techniques. Maize has male flowers, located on the tassel, and female flowers, located on the ear, on the same plant. Natural pollination occurs in maize when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the incipient ears.The development of maize hybrids requires the development of homozygous inbred lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are two of the breeding methods used to develop inbred lines from populations. Breeding programs combine desirable traits from two or more inbred lines or various broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred lines are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. The new inbreds are crossed with other inbred lines and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which have commercial potential.Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, each

<CLAIMS>
A plant exhibiting heritable, externally controllable male sterility, the nuclear genome of said plant lacking a native gene which affects flavonol production in said plant and is required for normal pollen development and hence male fertility, but including a DNA coding sequence for said gene under the control of an inducible promoter responsive to external control such that when said plant is exposed to an appropriate external stimulus for activation of said promoter male fertility is restored.
A plant as claimed in claim 1 wherein said flavonol whose production is affected by said gene is a compound of the formula:
