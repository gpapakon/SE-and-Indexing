<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a treatment for allergic asthma. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of antibodies 
recognizing the B1 or B2 epitope of the α4 subunit of Very Late Antigen-4 (VLA-4), a ligand on certain leukocytes for the endothelial cell receptor Vascular 
Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1), in the treatment of allergic asthma. Asthma is a condition of the respiratory tract characterized by widespread, reversible narrowing of the airways 
(bronchoconstriction) and increased sensitivity (hyperresponsiveness) of the airways to a variety of stimuli. The familiar 
symptomology of asthma, i.e., coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, dyspnea, is caused by airway smooth muscle contraction, 
increased bronchial mucus secretion, and inflammation. Though seldom fatal, asthma has been estimated to 
affect 10-20% of school-aged children around the world, and hospital admissions for asthma in children have increased 
dramatically in recent years, one survey for the United States indicating that hospital admissions for children under 15 
with asthma increased by at least 145% between 1970 and 1984. (See, M.R. Sears, 1990 [1].) Overall, it is estimated 
that 10 million Americans (4% of the population) have asthma, and some $4 billion is spent in treatment per year. (L.K. 
Altman, 1991 [2]; C. Starr, 1991 [3].) The causes of asthma are not completely understood, however the study of agents that trigger acute asthmatic episodes 
supports the theory that asthma is an immunological reaction by a subject in response to specific allergens of 
the subject's environment. These "triggers" exacerbate asthma by causing transient enhancement of airway hyperresponsiveness. 
Triggers that have been found to induce airway hyperresponsiveness include inhaled allergens, inhaled 
low molecular weight agents to which the subject has become sensitized (e.g., by occupational exposure), viral or mycoplasma 
respiratory infections, and oxidizing gases such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide. These "inducing" triggers can 
be distinguished from "inciting" triggers of bronchospastic episodes which include exercise, cold air, emotional stress, 
pharmacological triggers, inhaled irritants. The common feature of inducing triggers is that they are associated with airways 
inflammation; inciting triggers produce smooth muscle contractions (bronchospasms) which depend on the 
underlying degree of hyperresponsiveness, rather than increasing airways responsiveness themselves. (See, D.W. 
Cockcroft, 1990 [4].) The
