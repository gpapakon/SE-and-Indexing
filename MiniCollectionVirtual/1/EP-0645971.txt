<ABSTRACT>
The adjustable waist band fastener disclosed comprises two components, namely, a button (34) and a plate (46) which can be fixed to one end portion of a waist band. The plate (46) has a slot (50) running along it. The button (34) passes through the slot (50) and can be displaced along the slot. The structure is such that the button can be fixed in any one of a number of positions along the slot. The button can be positioned in two or more predetermined positions or be infinitely adjustable. The button can be a one part construction or comprise two parts. When a two part button is used, the stem (42) of one part is pushed through the slot before the two parts (36, 40) are connected together. When a one part button construction is used, the button must be capable of passing through the slot when in an appropriate position of orientation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ADJUSTABLE FASTENERS FOR WAISTBANDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONTHIS INVENTION relates to adjustable fasteners for waist bands.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONIt is sometimes convenient to be able to adjust the length of the waistband of a garment. For example, letting it out after a heavy meal can reduce the tension on the band and hence make it less uncomfortable. If one portion of the waist band is provided with a single button and the other portion with a number of button holes, then a degree of adjustment can be obtained. However, the unused button holes are always visible, and are unsightly. Furthermore, in the position of adjustment when the waist band is at its smallest, the unused button holes are in a part of the vraist band which flaps freely unless several buttons are provided to hold the flap in place. The provision of a number of button holes and a number of buttons is aesthetically unpleasing and complicate fastening and unfastening of the waist band.OBJECT OF THE INVENTIONThe object of the invention is to provide anSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

adjustable fastener which permits a waist band to take-up two or more different sizes without the necessity of providing more than one button or more than one button hole.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an adjustable fastener for the waist band of a garment, the fastener comprising a plate, a slot in the plate, a button including a stem and a head, the stem passing through said slot and being movable along the slot, and means for locking the button with respect to the plate in the position in the slot to which it has been moved.In one form said stem comprises a first part fast with said head and a second part connected to said first part by threading, the second part including two flats which fit between the bounding faces of said slot and prevent said second part rotating with respect to said plate, said first and second parts, when screwed together, clamping said plate between them so that the button is fixed with respect to said plate.In other form there are two rows of teeth on one face of the plate, the rows of teeth being one on each side of said slot, said button including a second head at the end of the stem remote from the first mentioned head, said second head including at least one tooth configured so that it fits in the gaps between the teeth of said rows.SUBSTITUTE SHEET

CLAIMS :
1. An adjustable fastener for the waist band of a garment, the fastener comprising a plate, a slot in the plate, a button including a stem and a head, the stem passing through said slot and being movable along the slot, and means for locking the button with respect to the plate in the position in the slot to which it has been moved.
2. An adjustable fastener according to claim 1, wherein said stem comprises a first part fast with said head and a second part connected to said first part by threading, the second part including two flats which fit between the bounding faces of said slot and prevent said second part rotating with respect to said plate, said first and second parts, when screwed together, clamping said plate between them so that the button is fixed with respect to said plate.
3. An adjustable fastener according to claim 1, and comprising two rows of teeth on one face of the plate, the rows of teeth being one on each side of said slot, said button including a second head at the end of the stem remote from the first mentioned head, said second head including at least one tooth configured so that it fits in the gaps between the teeth of said rows.
4. An adjustable fastener according to claim 3, wherein said second head is in the form of a cross bar having
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


a single tooth, said cross bar being capable of passing through said slot when aligned therewith.
5. An adjustable fastener according to claim 3, wherein said second head comprises a series of parallel teeth, and said button comprises two parts, each part including one of the heads and part of said stem.
6. An adjustable fastener as claimed in claim 1, in which said slot has, at intervals along the length thereof, portions which are wider than the remainder of the slot, said stem being stepped so as to provide a first portion which is substantially the same size as said wider portions and fits therein, and a second portion which is smaller than said first portion, is substantially the same size as said slot and fits therein, and the button has a second head which is too large to pass through said slot, said portions being between said heads with said second portion being between the first mentioned head and said first portion.
7. An adjustable fastener as claimed in claim 1, wherein said slot comprises a main slot which extends along the plate and a series of sub-slots which extend transversely of the main slot, said sub-slots having portions at the ends thereof which are remote from said main slot and which portions are parallel to said main slot.
8. An adjustable fastener for the waist band of a
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


garment, the fastener comprising a plate which can be fixed to the waist band, there being rows of teeth along two opposed edges of said plate, a bridging piece comprising a central section which spans across said plate between said edges, there being a gap between said bridging piece and said plate, and two legs which protrude from opposite ends of said central section and inter-engage between teeth of said rows thereby releasably to secure said bridging piece in its position of adjustment with respect to said plate, said bridging piece being flexible in such manner that distortion of said bridging piece splays said legs apart out of engagement with said teeth so that the position of said bridging piece with respect to the plate can be adjusted.
