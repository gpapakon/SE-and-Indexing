<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of materials with useful magnetostrictive
properties.Magnetostriction is the property which relates magnetic characteristics of a body
of material to a change of the shape of the material. The property is seen in the change
in size of bodies of certain materials when the magnetic environment changes or the
change in magnetic characteristic when a force is applied to such a body to change its
shape. Magnetostriction is a dimensionless quantity represented by the magnetostriction
constant Î»S, relating magnetisation and shape change and in the SI system of units useful
values are some tens or hundreds of parts per million, particularly for use in sensors and
transducers. For such uses a high magnetomechanical coupling factor is desirable. Also
"soft" magnetic properties are generally preferred.While thin film amorphous alloys and magnetic multilayers individually provide
some of the required properties there is still a strong need for a significant improvement
in the properties available and for materials which exhibit a useful combination of such
properties.It is an object of the invention to provide materials with improved properties and
methods of production of such materials.In the publication "Magnetostriction of Multilayer Co/Ag Films" by
H. Szymczak et al., published at the International Magnetics Conference, April 17-20,
1990, Digest page HC-09, a study is made of cobalt and silver multilayers to sense the
presence of any interdiffusion layers at the interfaces, which may cause changes in elastic
and magnetoelastic properties of the multilayers, and the magnetostriction constant of the
multilayers was measured against inverse layer thickness, but no evidence was presented
or discussed to suggest a magnetostriction constant greater than that of naturally-occurring
cobalt.In the publication "Magnetostriction and In-Situ Measurement of Stress in Co/Pd
Compositionally Modulated Multilayer Films During Fabrication", by H. Awano et al.,
published at the International Magnetics Conference, April 17-20, Digest page HC-08,
the anisotropy energy of the inverse magnetostriction effect in multilayer films is 
considered, and the stress at the interface of the films is measured, but it is stated that for
a qualitative discussion of magnetostriction effect at the interface, further research is
required.According to the invention as claimed there is provided a magnetic material comprising at least
two layers having different atomic structures, being at least one layer of a
