<ABSTRACT>
One method of determining the HCV genotype of a HCV strain 
is provided which involves subjecting the HCV strain to two stage 

PCR, wherein the first stage PCR involves utilizing antisense primer 
#186 (SEQ ID NO:5) and at least one of sense primers #256 (SEQ ID 

NO:4) and #256V (SEQ ID NO:1) for first stage amplification and 
wherein the second stage PCR involves utilizing at least one of 

sense primers #104 (SEQ ID NO:6) and #104V (SEQ ID NO:2) and at 
least one of antisense primers #296 (SEQ ID NO:7), #133 (SEQ ID 

NO:8), #134 (SEQ ID NO:9), #135 (SEQ ID NO:10), and #339 (SEQ ID 
NO:3) for the second stage amplification; the method further 

involves comparing the product of the second stage PCR with HCV 
genotypes I, II, III, IV, and V. The method may further involve 

synthesizing cDNA from viral RNA of the HCV strain and/or measuring 
the molecular weight of the product of the second stage PCR.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is a continuation-in-part of my 
copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/157,235, filed on 
November 24, 1993, now U.S. Patent No.          , which is 
incorporated by reference in its entirety. The present invention concerns methods of detecting 
genomic RNA of hepatitis C virus (hereinafter "HCV"), methods of 
determining HCV genotypes, genetic nucleotides of HCV, specific 
primers and probes, and test kits for determining HCV genotype or 
for detecting HCV. Four kinds of viral hepatitis were known as hepatitis A, 
B, D and E, and the presence of another hepatitis virus transmitted 
through blood transfusion was predicted. Post-transfusion hepatitis 
was remarkably reduced in Japan after introduction of diagnostic 
systems for screening hepatitis B virus in transfusion blood. 
However, there were still an estimated 280,000 annual cases of 
post-transfusion hepatitis presumed to be caused by another type of 
virus. In 1988, Chiron Corp. claimed that it had succeeded in 
cloning RNA virus genome, which it termed hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
as the causative agent of hepatitis which was not classified in any 
conventional type of viral hepatitis, and reported on its partial  
 
nucleotide sequence (European Patent Application 0,318,216). HCV 
(c100-3) antibody detection systems based on the sequence are now 
being introduced for screening of transfusion bloods and for 
diagnosis of hepatitis in patients. The detection systems for the c100-3 antibody have proven 
their partial association with HCV; however, they capture only about 
70% of carriers and chronic hepatitis patients, or they fail to 
detect the antibody in acute phase infection, thus leaving problems 
yet to be solved even after development of the c100-3 antibody by 
Chiron Corp. Up to today, partial or full nucleotide sequences of HCV 
isolates were cloned and disclosed by researchers in some 
laboratories and who studied the characteristics of the nucleotide 
sequences. As a result, many variances were found between those new 
nucleotide sequences and Chiron's sequence. Thus, it was elucidated 
that the nucleotide sequence of a sole strain could not predict the 
character of HCV. Those facts suggest that the establishment of diagnosis 
and treatment of hepatitis requires the study and comparison of the 
nucleotide sequences of many HCV strains in order to reveal the 
genetic variation and to characterize the genomes. The development of new diagnostic agents for screening of 
transfusion bloods requires studying
