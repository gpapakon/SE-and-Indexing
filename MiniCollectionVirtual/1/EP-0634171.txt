<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition for treating cerebral thrombosis, which is an emulsion comprising 0.2-1,000 
µg, per milliliter of the composition, of an isocarbacyclin represented by general formula (1), 0.05-0.5 g, per milliliter 

of the composition, of a vegetable oil, 0.01-0.5 g, per gram of the oil, of a phospholipid, and water; and a method 
of treating cerebral thrombosis with the same, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen or C₁-C₁₀ alkyl; and R² represents 

optionally substituted C₁-C₁₃ alkyl, optionally substituted C₂-C₁₃ alkenyl or alkynyl, or optionally substituted C₃-C₁₀ 
cycloalkyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of
pharmaceutical composition for therapy
of cerebral thrombosis. More specifically, it relates
to the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for the therapy of
cerebral thrombosis, which contains an isocarbacyclin
as an active ingredient, and a method for the therapy
of cerebral thrombosis.Prostacyclin is a topical hormone produced
mainly on an inner vessel wall of arterial duct of a
living body, and due to its high physiological
activities such as the platelet aggregation inhibiting
activity and the vasodilating activity, it is an
essential factor for adjusting the functions of a
living body. An attempt has been made to provide it
directly as a medicament (P. J. Lewis & J. O. Grady'
Clinical Pharmacology of Prostacyclin' Raven Press, N.
Y., 1981).Since, however, natural prostacyclin has, in
its molecule, an enol ether bond which is easily
hydrolyzable, it is easily deactivated under neutral or
acidic conditions, and it cannot be said to be a
preferred compound as a medicament due to its chemical
instability. Therefore, chemically stable synthetic
prostacyclin derivatives having physiological
activities equivalent to those of natural prostacyclin
have been studied at home and abroad (see R. C.
Nickolson, et al, Medicinal Research Reviews, Vol. 5,
page 5, 1985). Among these derivatives, isocarbacyclin
obtained by replacing oxygen atoms in the 6 and 9
positions of prostacyclin with methylene group (-CH=
group) and converting double bonds in the 5 and 6
positions to single bonds is a derivative which is 
highly chemically stable and has bioactivities
equivalent to those of natural prostacyclin, and
studies are under way to apply it to a medicament.On the other hand, as compounds prepared by
stabilizing prostaglandins as fat preparations, fat
emulsions containing PGE1 and PGA1 have been proposed
in recent years for the purpose of vasodilation
activity, platelet aggregation inhibition and
depression activity [see Japanese Laid-open Patent
Publications Nos. 222014/1983 and 141518/1984, and Ann.
Rheum. Diseases, 41 263 (1982); Journal of Pharmacy and
Pharmacology, 35, 398 (1983)]. It is also proposed to
apply this method to an anticancer agent for increasing
the selective targeting of the anticancer agent on a
target organ (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
No. 122423/1984). However, it has been difficult to
prepare prostacyclin into a fat emulsion due to its
chemical instability. Attempts have therefore been
made to prepare the above
