<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a composition for 
rectal administration which comprises a benzimidazole 

compound having antiulcer activity and a salt of C₆₋₂₀ 
fatty acid, both of which are intermingled with each 

other in a base for rectal administration. 
The composition for rectal administration of the 
present invention is effective for the treatment of 

gastrointestinal ulcers, is excellent in the stability 
of the active ingredient therein and the absorption 

thereof to thereby insure an early attainment of 
therapeutically effective blood concentration and 

permits control of the rate of absorption of the drug. 
Furthermore, the composition for rectal administration 

of the present invention swells in the intestinal 
tract, attaches itself to the mucosa, and releases the 

active ingredient gradually over a long time to supply 
the drug at a high concentration and with high 

efficiency. Therefore, the expected therapeutic 
efficacy can be obtained at a low dosage level with a 

minimum of side effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for
rectal administration comprising a benzimidazole
compound having antiulcer activity.Benzimidazole compounds are gathering much
attention as therapeutic agents for peptic ulcers and/or
prophylactic agents for relapse of ulcers, because they
have gastric acid antisecretory and gastric mucosa-protecting
activities.As compositions for rectal administration of such
benzimidazole compounds, there has been reported 1) a
rectal suppository comprising (i) omeprazole, (ii) a
mixture of polyethylene glycols or a mixture of adeps
solidus and sodium laurylsulfate and (iii) a water-soluble
basic amino acid (USP 5,219,870), 2) a form of
suppositories comprising an omeprazole compound and a
neutral fat base (USP 4,738,974), and 3) a suppository
comprising (i) a 2-[(2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole
compound having
antiulcer activity and (ii) hard fat whose acid value
is less than 13 and hydroxy group value is less than 40
(JP-A-5213752), but none of them is fully
satisfactory in the stability of the active ingredient
in the composition. A gastrointestinal mucosa-adherent
matrix is reported (EP-A-514008), but no rectal dosage
composition comprising such mucosa-adherent matrix is
known.EP-A-0 248 634 discloses a physiologically active
benzimidazole derivative having the formula (I): 

wherein R1 is hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to
8 carbon atoms, a fluoroalkyl group having 1 to 6
carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group, phenyl group or an
aralkyl group, R2 is hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl
group, or R1 and R2 together with the adjacent nitrogen
atom form a ring, and each of R3a, R3b, R4a, R4b and R4c
independently is hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a
flouroalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a lower
alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a lower
alkoxycarbonyl group or an amino group, which is in the
amorphous state or is kept in contact with an organic
or inorganic basic material.JP910042894 relates to a glycyrrhizin suppository
with improved rectal absorption which comprises a
glycyrrhizin compound or its salt, a nonionic
surfactant and/or a middle-chain fatty acid salt as an
absorption enhancer. JP810030688 describes a
preparation for rectal administration which comprises a
pharmacologically active substance and absorption
accelerating compounds which contain at least one
absorption assistant selected from saccharides,
inorganic salts, benzylalcohol and PVP. Neither of
these references relates to benzimidazole compounds.The main object of the present invention
