<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to an electrostatic 
discharge device (12), painlessly discharges 

electrostatic energy from a computer operator and/or an 
optical element such as a filter (10) mounted on a 

cathode ray tube (CRT) computer monitor (11). The 
electrostatic discharge device (12) preferably is mounted 

on the frame (13) of the optical filter, and includes an 
electrostatic discharge pad circuit (12A) which includes 

a discharge pad (20) comprising a substrate (22) coated 
with a condutive material (21) and connected to ground 

(32) . A person such as a computer operator who contacts 
the coated substrate is discharged of any electrostatic 

charge through the coated substrate, to ground. A 
display (14) to indicate the discharge can be connected 

between the discharge pad and ground and in parallel with 
a resistor to control the rate of discharge through the 

display. the device also includes an electrostatic field 
drain circuit (12B) for discharging electrostatic energy 

emanating from the face of a CRT monitor. The field 
drain includes a transparent, electrically conductive 

coating (17) which is formed on the face of the optical 
filter and is connected to an input terminal of a 

display, the output terminal of which is connected to 
ground (32). Electrostatic charge emitted from the 

monitor and deposited on the filter is transmitted 
through the display, which indicates the discharge, to 

ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatic discharge 
device and, in particular, to the design and fabrication of a 
device for discharging electrostatic energy, for example, from 
computer operators and/or an object (e.g. optical element) that 
is in the electrostatic field emitted from a cathode ray tube 
(CRT) monitor. Increased miniaturization and device densities in integrated 
circuit chips have been accompanied by an increased sensitivity 
to electrostatic energy. A computer operator who is 
electrostatically charged (for example, by frictional contact 
with a carpet) and directly or indirectly contacts an integrated 
circuit (via the case of a computer) can damage that integrated 
circuit through the mechanism of electrostatic discharge. In 
addition, electrostatic discharge can be painful. Existing devices for discharging electrostatic energy do 
not eliminate the problem of shocks. Furthermore, some existing 
devices do not provide a feedback mechanism to indicate to an 
operator that electrostatic discharge is occurring. Without 
feedback, the operator does not know whether the discharge device 
is working, and whether she or he has been fully discharged. In view of the above problems, one object of our invention 
is to painlessly discharge electrostatic energy from a person, 
such as a computer operator. Other objects of the invention, not exhaustive, are to 
discharge electrostatic energy from an object such as an optical 
element, for example an optical filter, mounted in front of the 
face of a CRT monitor; to indicate the discharge of electrostatic 
energy; and to control the time required to discharge 
electrostatic energy.  According to the present invention, the foregoing and other 
objects are attained in an electrostatic discharge device which 
is adapted for mounting on a video display terminal and which 
comprises a touch pad or discharge pad in the form of a 
substrate and a coating, formed on the substrate, which has a 
surface resistivity between about 10 megohms per square and about 
100 megohms per square and is connected to ground. The 
electrostatic charge on a body such as a person or object which 
contacts the discharge pad is conducted from the coated 
substrate, which controls the rate of discharge of the object, 
to ground. In another embodiment, the device comprises a 
display, which is connected between the coated substrate and 
ground , for indicating the electrostatic discharge through the 
device, and is connected in parallel with a resistor, for 
controllin
