<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a self-aligning high-density
printed circuit connector system. It relates more
particularly, though not exclusively, to connectors for
releasably connecting contacts of a flexible or rigid
circuit to conductive pads on a printed circuit board and
to the interconnection of conductive pads on two such
boards.In electrical systems, flexible printed circuits are
employed as electrical jumpers or cables for
interconnecting rows of terminal pins or pads of printed
circuit boards. A connector, mounted to one or both ends
of the jumper, is formed with a set of electrical
receptacles or sockets which are designed to receive the
terminal posts or contact the pads on the printed circuit
board.In today's world wide electronics market,
manufacturers are placing emphasis on increasing their
product's reliably and reducing assembly costs to remain
competitive. A primary focus of each manufacturer is to
reduce the cost and increase the circuit density
associated with interconnecting the sub-assemblies and
components found within its products. Another emerging
focus in today's electronics market is to pack more
electronic functions into smaller packages. This means
higher density modules, each requiring multiple
interconnections to other modules.Connector manufacturers have not kept pace with
today's market needs. Simply stated, conventional
connector technology cannot accommodate todays high-density
requirements. This is because existing connectors 
consist of individual stamped contacts assembled into a molded plastic
housing. The physical size required to manufacture an acceptable spring
contact eliminates this technology in high-density circuits. For the last 25
years electronic systems have been designed around conventional
connector technology. Connector manufacturers have effectively led this
market, and system designers gladly followed, because these connectors
satisfied their needs. This cannot continue as three significant events are
combining to change the role of connectors forever. They are:
a) A new generation of chips that will drive PC board
manufacturers to produce boards with conductors on 0.15 mm (0.006
inch) centers. These boards must be interconnected to other modules or
to the outside world and will require a high-density connector and
interconnect cable.b) A new generation of high resolution Liquid Crystal Displays
will require conductors on 0.1 mm (0.004 inch) centers. These displays
must be interconnected to PC boards and/or other modules. This will
require a
