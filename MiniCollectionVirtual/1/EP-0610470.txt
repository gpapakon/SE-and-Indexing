<DESCRIPTION>
FRAGARIA PLANTS AND SEEDSThe present invention relates to plants propagatable from seed and seeds therefor. In particular, the invention relates to polyploid Fragaria or strawberry plants which are propagatable from seed.BACKGROUNDPolyploid Fragaria plants do not breed true and the genetics is very complex. The progeny of a vegetatively propagated variety fertilised with its own pollen are all different.There have been some attempts to improve breeding strategies with a view to acquiring improved strawberry types however such strategies have met with limited or no success since problems associated with inbreeding depression have not been overcome.Niemirowicz-Szycytt K.[(1989) Acta Horticulturae 265: 97-104] failed to control inbreeding depression within the inbreeding program employed and as a result did not obtain viable and suitably homogeneous (uniform) inbred lines capable of being used in inbreeding programs for obtaining agronomically attractive strawberry plants in commercial numbers.Other workers have attempted to use alternative routes to obtain viable octoploid lines for use in strawberry breeding. Sayegh A.J. and Hennarty M.J.[(1989) Acta Horticulturae 265: 129-135], attempted the production of haploids of commercial strawberry cultivars using androgenesis and intergeneric crosses followed by embryo rescue and culture. However, that approach was unsuccessful since the first essential step, that of obtaining haploids, was not realised and as a consequence the idea of doubling the haploid number 

to create octoploids and then selecting viable octoploid lines suitable for use in a breeding program could not be attempted.A recurring problem associated with strawberry breeding programs as disclosed in the art is that inbred lines obtained through repeated selfing programs lack plant vigour and as a consequence are too weak to continue with further. Lack of plant vigour is generally evident at about the third or fourth or later generations.In all cases, such programs have not been designed with a view to obtaining commercial quantities of Fl hybrids and seeds therefor. The goals of such breeding programs have been the acquisition of new breeding lines for use as basis for acquiring new varieties suitable for creating vegetatively propagated cultivars.As a consequence of the difficulties associated with classical strawberry breeding techniques, breeders have faced an uphill task in improving their gene pooLand each year breeders search for seedlings from within their breeding programs for plants
