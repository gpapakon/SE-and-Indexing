<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oral compositions 
containing an anticalculus or an antiplaque/antigingivitis 
agent. "Oral composition" means a composition for topical 
applications to the oral cavity to clean and care for the 
teeth as well as the oral cavity surfaces. Representatives 
of such compositions are oral hygiene products and 
dentifrices such as mouthwashes or rinses, toothpaste, 
dental gels, tooth powder, chewing gum, lozenges, and 
similar products. In addition to cleaning teeth to remove 
dental plaque, the function of oral hygiene preparations is 
to stop the formation of dental calculus, to prevent dental 
disorders such as caries, periodontitis and gingivitis, and 
also to eliminate halitosis. Dental calculus, or tartar as it is sometimes called, 
is a hard mineralized material which forms on teeth that 
consists of inorganic and organic components. The 
inorganic portion is largely calcium and orthophosphate 
arranged in a crystal lattice called hydroxyapatite (HAP). 
The organic portion is derived mainly from microorganisms 
(i.e., bacteria, yeast, etc.) as well as epithelial cells, 
white blood cells and food debris. Formation of dental calculus occurs in two steps. In 
the first step, plaque is deposited on the teeth. "Plaque" 
consists of inorganic and organic components derived from 
saliva, food and bacteria which are present in the oral 
cavity. Most of the plaque consists of dead and living 
bacteria surrounded by a gel-like matrix derived from the 
bacteria and saliva. In the second phase, plaque undergoes 
calcification to form dental calculus. Initially,  
 
amorphous deposits of calcium phosphate begins to appear on 
and within the matrix of the dental plaque. As the 
aggregates of calcium phosphate become sufficiently closely 
packed together, they crystallize to form HAP. The 
amorphous calcium phosphate, although related to 
hydroxyapatite, differs from it in crystal structure, 
particle morphology and stoichiometry. In addition to being an integral step for the 
formation of calculus, consequences of the presence of 
plaque include gingivitis, periodontitis, tooth decay 
(dental caries) and denture associated problems. 
Inhibition of oral bacteria involved in the formation of 
plaque by antimicrobials or antiseptic agents is one means 
to retard the formation of plaque, thus aiding in 
preventing or controlling the formation of calculus and 
other plaque related diseases; see, for example, 
P. S. Hull, J. Clinical Periodontology, 7, 431-442 (1980).
