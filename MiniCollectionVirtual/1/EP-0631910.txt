<ABSTRACT>
A seat belt apparatus in which a hook (34) is formed on a 
boot covering (22) an anchor plate (24). Accordingly, the hook (34) 

can be 
engaged with an opening (40) of a tongue plate (26) during an assembly 

stage of a vehicle. As a result, the anchor plate (24) can be 
held by the tongue plate (26), and it is therefore possible to 

prevent surface of a center pillar of a vehicle, which 
surface faces a vehicle compartment, from being damaged by 

the anchor plate (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seat belt apparatus 
comprising: 
a take-up device with which one longitudinal end 
portion of a webbing for restraining a vehicle occupant is 
engaged, for winding said webbing into a roll form; an intermediate webbing support member which is 
provided on a vehicle-compartment-facing side of an upper 
portion of a center pillar of a vehicle and through which a 
longitudinally intermediate portion of said webbing passes; an anchor member attached to a side portion of a 
passenger seat, another longitudinal end of said webbing 
being engaged with said anchor member; and a tongue plate which is located between said anchor 
plate and said intermediate webbing support member such that 
the longitudinally intermediate portion of said webbing is 
passed through said tongue plate, said tongue plate being 
engaging with a buckle device. Although there exist various types of seat belt 
apparatuses designed to restrain a vehicle occupant by a 
webbing, a so-called three-point type seat belt apparatus 
will be described below as an example. A three-point type seat belt apparatus is comprised of 
a take-up device disposed in the vicinity of the lower 
portion of a center pillar, a slip joint which is disposed 
on the upper portion of the center pillar and through which 
the intermediate portion of the webbing taken out from the 
take-up device passes through, an anchor plate with which 
the leading end of the webbing is engaged and which is fixed 
to the floor of a vehicle, and a tongue plate through which 
the intermediate portion of the webbing is passed and which 
is located between the anchor plate and the slip joint so as 
to be engageable with a buckle device. A vehicle occupant 
grasps the tongue plate, and engages it with the buckle  
 
device so as to bring the three-point seat belt apparatus 
into a fastened state in which the vehicle occupant is held 
or restrained by the portion of the webbing corresponding to 
the shoulder of the vehicle occupant and the portion of the 
webbing corresponding to the lap of the vehicle occupant. Seat belt apparatuses of this kind have a drawback in 
that the attachment position of the anchor plate is 
stationary even when the passenger slides his or her seat 
along seat tracks to obtain a comfortable sitting feeling. 
To obviate this drawback, it has been proposed to attach the 
anchor plate to the side portion of the seat. In this case, 
the attachment position of the anchor plate is synchronously 
moved in accordance with the amount
