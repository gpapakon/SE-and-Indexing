<ABSTRACT>
In a zirconium-alloy fuel element cladding, a method 
for generating regions of coarse and fine intermetallic 

precipitates across the cladding wall is provided. The method 
includes steps of specific heat treatments and anneals that 

coarsen precipitates in the bulk of the cladding. The method 
also includes at least one step in which an outer region 

(exterior) of the cladding is heated to the beta or alpha plus 
beta phase, while an inner region (interior) is maintained at 

a temperature at which little or no metallurgical change 
occurs. This method produces a composite cladding in which 

the outer region comprises fine precipitates and the inner 
region comprises coarse precipitates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of fabricating
zircaloy cladding for use in nuclear fuel elements.Nuclear reactors have their fuel contained in sealed
cladding for the isolation of the nuclear fuel from the
moderator/coolant system. The term cladding, as used herein,
refers to a zirconium based alloy tube composed of at least
one metal in addition to the zirconium base. The term
precipitates, as used herein, refers to added metals of the
cladding and forming isolated structures in a matrix
throughout the zirconium alloy. These precipitates may or may
not constitute intermetallics. Typically, these precipitates
are uniformly distributed in the matrix -- although they vary
in size. Further, so-called fine precipitates (below 0.1
microns), can either be in the matrix format or the so-called
two dimensional format where the precipitates occupy sheet
like layer near the outer surface of the zirconium alloy.The cladding -- nominally in the order of 0.030
inches (1 inch = 2,54 cm) thick -- is formed in the shape of a tube with the
nuclear fuel contained typically in pellet form therein.
These pellets are stacked in contact with one another for
almost the entire length of each cladding tube, which cladding
tube is in the order of 160 inches (1 inch = 2,54 cm) in length. Typically, the
cladding tube is provided with springs for centering the fuel
pellets and so-called "getters" for absorbing fission gases.
Thereafter, the internal portions of the fuel rod are 
pressurized with various gases for optimum dissipation of
gases produced from the fission reaction, and sealed at both
ends.Zirconium and its alloys, under normal
circumstances, are excellent nuclear fuel cladding since they
have low neutron absorption cross sections and at temperatures
below about 398° C (at or below the core temperature of the
operating reactor) are strong, ductile, extremely stable and
nonreactive in the presence of demineralized water or steam.
"Zircaloys" are a widely used family of corrosion-resistant
zirconium alloy cladding materials. The Zircaloys are
composed of 98-99% by weight zirconium, with the balance being
tin, iron, chromium, and nickel. "Zircaloy-2" and "Zircaloy-4"
are two widely-used zirconium-based alloys for cladding.
(Zircaloy-4 omitting nickel).Cladding corrosion is a potential problem both in
boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors. For
example, in a PWR, water does not boil -- although in modern
designs minute boil can occur at the top of some fuel rods.
The oxygen level is relatively suppressed,

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing a zirconium alloy tube, shell obtained by extruding beta quenched zirconium said method comprising the steps of:

(a) performing a coarsening anneal at a temperature in the range 700° C to 750° C
for a period at 1 to 10 hours such that intermetallic precipitates coarsen throughout the entire tube;
(b) selectively heating an outer region of the tube by first heating the outer region to at
least the alpha plus beta region while cooling an inner region of the tube and then rapidly

quenching the outer region; and
(c) performing cold work steps, each said cold work followed by an
anneal step, the anneal step or steps being conducted at a temperature of greater than about

576°C, wherein the first cold work and anneal steps are
optionally performed between steps (a) and (b).
The method of Claim 1 wherein the zirconium alloy is selected from the
group consisting of Zircaloy2, Zircaloy-4 and Zirlo.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the step of selectively heat treating the
outer region of the tube is conducted with an induction coil heater.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the step of selectively heat treating heats
the outer region of the tube to the alpha beta region.
The method of claim 1, wherein

(a) three of said cold work steps followed by an anneal step are performed;
(b) an outer region of the tube being selective heat treated between first
and second cold worksteps by first heating the outer region to the alpha plus 

beta region while cooling an inner region of the tube and then rapidly quenching
the outer region;
The method of Claim 5 wherein the zirconium alloy is Zircaloy-2 or
Zircaloy-4 and the step of selectively heat treating heats the outer region of the

tube to a temperature of about 927°C.
The method of Claim 5 wherein said selective heat treating of an outer
region includes the steps of conductively heating said outer region while cooling

said tube with a fluid.
