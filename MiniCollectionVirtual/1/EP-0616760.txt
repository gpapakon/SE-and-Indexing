<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for cutting and mulching lawns includes a 
shallow substantially cylindrical housing (2) having an 

open bottom and adapted, in use, to have its axis 
perpendicular to a lawn to be cut; a blade (13), mounted 

within the housing (2) to rotate about an axis (14) 
co-axial with that of the housing (2), the blade (13) 

extending radially from the axis and rotating in a 
plane near the bottom of the housing (2); a grass exit 

chute (7) communicating with the inside of the housing 
(2); a source of rotational power in the form of an 

electric motor for rotating the blade (13); means for 
changing the direction of rotation of the blade (13); 

and means for allowing cut grass within the housing (2) 
to pass out of the housing (2) into the chute (7) when 

the blade (13) is rotating in a first direction and to 
prevent cut grass in the housing (2) from entering the 

chute (7) when the blade (13) is rotating in a second 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the treatment 
of lawns and, more specifically, for the mowing and 
mulching of lawns. When lawns are mown it is generally advisable to 
collect the grass cuttings which would otherwise 
collect on the surface of the lawn and apart from  
 
damaging the lawn, would look unsightly. The cuttings 
are often collected by way of a suitable grass box or 
collector attached to the mower which is used. Lawnmowing is a time consuming and arduous task. An 
improvement to lawnmowing design would be a device 
which saves labour and time. An easy mechanism which 
would save the user from having to regularly detach the 
grassbox and carry this to a dumping site would save 
much time while still giving the user the opportunity 
of operating the lawnmower so that it collected all 
grass cuttings. Presently designs are such when 
lawnmowers are operated without grass catchers fitted 
in an effort to reduce the time taken to cut a lawn the 
grass entering the grass exit chute is compacted 
against the safety plate which closes this chute when 
no catcher is fitted. This forms large agglomerates of 
grass which are not evenly distributed over the lawn 
and need physical removal after mowing resulting in no 
labour saving at all. It has been recognised that it could be beneficial to 
lawns if at least a portion of the cuttings could be 
distributed over the lawn provided that these mowings  
 
were somewhat finer than is usually the case and that 
they were relatively evenly distributed. To do this the so called rotary type of lawnmower (that 
is with a blade having a substantially vertical axis of 
rotation) has been provided with a removable or 
adjustable baffle at the exit chute thereof. This 
baffle blocks or partially blocks the exit chute so 
that grass mowings under the lawnmower float in an air 
pocket above the blades before falling again into the 
blades and being chopped into small pieces. This 
process may be repeated before the grass falls onto the 
lawn in the form of mulch, the mowings being of a size 
small enough to find their way into the lawn and not 
simply lie on the top thereof. Such an apparatus is known 
from US-A-4 951 449, which discloses the features of the 
preamble of claim 1. Failure to provide such a baffle plate when mowing 
without the grass catcher fitted results in the grass 
entering the exit chute compacting and forming grass 
agglomerates. These are unsightly as they eventually 
exit the mower housing and as they are typically in 
lump form

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (1) suitable for treating lawns which 
comprises: 


a shallow generally cylindrical housing (2) having 
an open bottom and adapted, in use, to have its 

axis perpendicular to a lawn to be cut; 
a blade (13), mounted within the housing (2) to 
rotate about an axis (14) generally co-axial with 

that of the housing (2), the blade (13) extending 
radially from the axis and rotating in a plane 

near the open bottom of the housing (2); 
a grass exit chute (7) communicating with the 
inside of the housing (2); and 
a source of rotational power for rotating the 
blade (13), characterised in that it has means 

for changing the direction of rotation of the 
blade (13) and 
means for allowing cut grass within the housing 
(2) to pass out of the housing (2) into the chute 

(7) when the blade (13) is rotating in a first 
direction and to prevent cut grass in the housing 

from entering the chute (7) when the blade (13) is 
rotating in a second direction. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
housing (2) is mounted on wheels (5) for 

supporting it on a grass surface to be cut. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 which includes a 
handle (6) for use in pushing the apparatus on a 

grass surface. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which the blade (13) extends on both 

sides of its rotational axis (14) and has cutting 
edges (18) on opposing edges. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which the grass exit chute (7) is 

located substantially tangentially to the housing 
(2) and intercepting the path of grass cuttings in 

the housing (2) when the blade (13) is rotating in 
a first direction. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which the grass exit chute (7) is at 

least partially located above the level of the 
blade (13).  

 
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which the source of rotational power is 

an electric motor. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 in which the means 
for changing the direction of rotation of the 

blade (13) is a reversible electric motor and a 
suitable switching mechanism. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims in which there is a deflector plate (12) 

within the housing (2) adjacent the chute (7), the 
configuration of the deflector plate (12) being to 

deflect grass cuttings cut by the blade (13) 
moving in the second direction from entering the 

chute (7).
