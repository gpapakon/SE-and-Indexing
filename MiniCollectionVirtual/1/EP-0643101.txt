<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved curing system 
for halogenated elastomers, as well as blends thereof with 

more highly unsaturated elastomers, using an 
organopolysulfide derivative of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole 

as a curing agent. These polysulfides are 
particularly effective for the cure of compositions 

containing halogenated copolymers of a C₄ to C₇ isoolefin 
and para-alkylstyrene, leading to fast, low reversion cures 

even after extended elevated temperature exposure, while 
providing improved scorch safety and improved adhesion 

properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of organo
polysulfide derivatives of 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole
as a curative in vulcanizable elastomer systems
containing halogenated elastomeric copolymers of
isobutylene and isoprene or para-alkylstyrene.Halogenated copolymers of isobutylene and up to about 4
mole % of isoprene (butyl rubber) are well known polymer
materials whose vulcanizates offer some outstanding
properties not possessed by many other diolefin based
elastomers. Articles prepared from many cured halogenated
elastomers offer improved resistance to oils and greases as
well as resistance to oxygen and ozone degradation. Butyl
rubber vulcanizates exhibit good abrasion resistance,
excellent impermeability to air, water vapor and many
organic solvents, as well as resistance to aging and
sunlight. These properties render these materials ideal
candidates for one or more applications such as water
hoses, organic fluid hoses, components in tire
construction, gaskets, adhesive compositions and various
molded articles.More recently, a new class of halogenated elastomeric
interpolymers have been discovered which offer many of the
same properties as halogenated butyl rubber, but are even
more ozone and solvent resistant. These materials are the
halogenation product of random copolymers of a C4 to C7
isoolefin, such as isobutylene, and a para-alkylstyrene
comonomer wherein at least some of the alkyl substituent 
groups present in the styrene monomer units contain
halogen.More preferred materials are elastomeric copolymers of
isobutylene and para-methylstyrene containing from about
0.5 to about 20 wt. % para-methylstyrene wherein up to
about 65 % of the methyl substituent groups present on the
benzene ring contain a bromine or chlorine atom, preferably
a bromine atom. These copolymers have a substantially
homogeneous compositional distribution such that at least
95% by weight of the polymer has a para-alkylstyrene
content within 10% of the average para-alkylstyrene content
of the polymer. They are also characterized by a very
narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than
about 5, more preferably less than about 2.5, viscosity
average molecular weights in the range of from about
300,000 up to about 2,000,000, and a glass transition
temperature (Tg) of below about 50°C.These copolymers may be prepared by slurry polymerization
of the monomer mixture using a Lewis Acid catalyst,
followed by halogenation, preferably bromination, in
solution in the presence of halogen and a radical initiator
such
