<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water-absorptive
polymers having enhanced gel strength. More
particularly, this invention relates to water-absorptive
polymer compositions exhibiting enhanced
strength and stability of a gel impregnated with water,
especially with a body fluid such as urine, and a method
for producing water-absorptive polymers having
such excellent gel properties.In recent years, water-absorptive polymers
have been practically used not only in the field of
sanitary goods such as sanitary napkins and disposable
paper diapers but also for a variety of industrial
materials such as water-retaining materials, dew
condensation-preventing materials, freshness-preserving
materials and solvent-dehydrating materials. They have
been put to practical use also in the fields of
afforestation, agriculture and horticulture. Thus, their
application is now becoming wider.Of these application fields, sanitary goods such as
sanitary napkins, disposable paper diapers and pads for
those who are suffering from incontinence have been
improved in a feeling upon use due to improvements in the
materials used, various types of gathers, and the like.
Therefore, the time during which the sanitary goods can
be comfortably used is becoming longer. Also, a case
where the water-absorptive polymers are used under
extremely severe conditions is now being increased in the
fields of industrial materials, agriculture and
horticulture.A water-absorptive polymer takes the form of
a gel when it absorbs body fluids such as urine, 
menstrual blood and sweat. Such a gel deteriorates and
decomposes with time and loses its strength, and, at the
same time, the surface and inner part of the gel become
sticky. Namely, the liquid-retaining properties of the
gel become worse with time. Such problems caused by this
that a liquid runs out without being absorbed in a
sanitary good upon use, and that a feeling upon use of a
sanitary good becomes worse with time, are becoming more
serious as the time during which a sanitary good is used
is now becoming longer.Reasons for the deterioration and decomposition of
the gel are not fully clarified so far. It is however
assumed that an extremely small amount of active
impurities contained in body fluids such as urine
accelerate the decomposition of a water-absorptive
polymer gel in accordance with a single mechanism or a
plurality of mechanisms. The degree of and the behavior
in the decomposition of the polymer gel vary widely
depending upon the state of the gel when a liquid is
absorbed therein and
