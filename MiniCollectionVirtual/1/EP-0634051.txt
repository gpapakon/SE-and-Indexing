<CLAIMS>
Multipole low-voltage circuit breaker (1) having 
a switching shaft (2) which is common to all the poles, 

having pole units (9) which are composed of at least two 
switching chambers (3) and having a drive 

device (6) which is common to all the pole units (9),
 
characterized in that 


the switching shaft (2) is split into shaft sections 
(21, 22, 23) corresponding to the number of pole 

units (9), 
the shaft section (21) of the central pole unit (9) 
has at both ends a central pin (24) and a lever (25) 

which is mounted close to the pin (24) and has a 
through-hole (26) for the accommodation of a coupling 

bolt (35), and 
the lateral shaft sections (22, 23) which are adjacent 
to the central shaft section (21) have at their 

end facing the central shaft section (21) a central 
opening (27), which is provided for the accommodation 

of the central pin (24), and, close to the 
central opening (27), likewise a lever (30) having 

a through-hole (31) for the accommodation of the 
coupling bolt (35). 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


the supporting frame (5) of the circuit breaker 
(1) has a support (20) which is dimensioned for the 

entire width of all the pole units (9) including a 
maximum oversize which results from tolerances, and 
side walls (4) are fitted to both lateral ends of  
 

the support (20). 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 2 in a version 
for movement within the push-in frame (8),
 
characterized in that 


a movement shaft (14) is arranged in the circuit 
breaker (1), extends transversely with respect to 

the the movement direction of said circuit breaker 
(1), projects laterally beyond the side walls (4) 

and is provided with link levers (15), and 
the movement shaft (14) is mounted in the pole units 
(9) and passes through openings (36) in the side 

walls (4) with clearance. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


the shaft sections (21, 22, 23) each have at least 
one further lever (32), and 
the coupling bolts (35) each pass through at least 
one of the additional levers (32) of the lateral 

shaft sections (22, 23). 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 2,
 
characterized in that 


an intermediate wall (38) is in each case arranged 
between the pole units (9) in the supporting frame 

(5), and 
a bearing bush (40) for the central pin (44) of the 
central shaft section (21) is supported in the 

intermediate wall (37), an opening (42), which is in 
the form of an arch and is matched to the pivoting 

angle of the switching shaft (2) during switching, 
being incorporated for the passage of the coupling 

bolt (35).
