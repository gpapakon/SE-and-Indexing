<ABSTRACT>
A calibration boot 12 for use with an optical catheter 10 includes a plurality
of materials, each having a different reflectivity characteristic with respect

to known wavelengths of light. The boot 12 is positioned over the distal end
of the optical catheter 10 and light is emitted from the distal end of the

optical catheter 10 into one of the materials at a time. At each emission,
the reflected or backscattered light is measured by a detector and a plurality

of signals are obtained. The plurality of readings are used to calibrate the
overall optical catheter and system. The use of a plurality of calibration

signals improves the overall system accuracy, particularly where two or
more variables are present in the measured parameter. In the preferred

system, the parameter being sensed in the oxygenation of blood invasively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fibre optic sensors that may be incorporated on the 
end of a catheter to measure a blood parameter such as oxygen saturation, 
haematocrit or other parameter and, more particularly, to a disposable 
calibrator that offers multipoint calibration in a single package. It has been well recognized that a fibre optic sensor requires calibration to 
compensate for manufacturing variations such as the light transmission of 
fibres, spacing between fibres at the tip of the sensor etc. There are also 
variations in the instrumentation such as the light output, the gain of the 
receiving circuit having the photodetectors, and the loss in the connection 
between the instrument and the fibre optic sensor. The calibration of the 
whole system requires a reference material that will provide a known 
amount of signal when the sensor is in close contact with the reference 
material. The algorithm within the signal processing in the instrument will 
generate a set of correction factors such that the instrument indicates the 
known value that is associated with the reference material. Current known means of providing such calibration are as shown and 
described in US Patent 4,322,164 of Shaw et al and US 4,744,656 of 
Moran et al. In each of the aforementioned patents, however, the 
calibration utilizes one substance to provide a known amount of signal and 
thus calibration is accomplished by selecting only one point on a calibration 
curve. If the optical signal such as reflection light, scattered light, fluorescent light, 
is linearly proportional to the change of one physical parameter, such as the 
oxygen content of the blood, then one point calibration is sufficient for the 
required accuracy. However, if the signal is a function of more that one 
physical parameter, for example, the reflection light changes as the oxygen 
content and the haematocrit of the blood changes, then the system 
accuracy is not sufficient with one point calibration but requires two point or 
multi point calibration.  Accordingly, in such instances, the systems of the aforementioned patents 
are not sufficient to provide the accuracy for the measurement of blood 
parameters. The present invention provides a means and method of calibrating a fibre 
optic sensor having improved accuracy and capable of locating multiple 
points along a calibration curve. According to one aspect of the present invention, a disposable calibration 
boot for an optical catheter having a distal end and having at least one 
optical means
