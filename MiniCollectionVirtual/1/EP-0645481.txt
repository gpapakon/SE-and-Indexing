<ABSTRACT>
A textile yarn ring spinning or twisting apparatus and a 
method of doffing a fully-wound textile yarn package (8) 

therefrom, the apparatus comprising a spindle (1) for carrying 
a yarn support tube or bobbin (2), the spindle (1) being rotatable 

about its axis to enable yarn to be wound on the tube (2) to 
form a yarn package (8), a yarn reserve winding member (9) mounted 

coaxially with the spindle (1) around which member (9) yarn may be 
wound prior to the doffing of a wound yarn package (8) from the 

spindle (1), and clutch means (17,19) selectively to clutch the reserve 
winding member (9) to the spindle (1) so that with the clutch means 

(17,19) in a first position the reserve winding member (9) is 
constrained to rotate with the spindle (1) and in a second 

position the reserve winding member (9) is substantially 
disengaged from the spindle (1) and free to rotate relative 

thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to textile yarn ring 
spinning, twisting or doubling apparatus wherein the yarn 
is wound on a tube carried by a driven spindle, the yarn 
being wound around the tube to form a yarn package. The 
term "textile yarn" is intended to encompass both natural 
and artificial material including filaments. The 
invention may be particularly advantageously practised in 
textile machines of the ring spinning and twisting type 
which have a large number of driven spindles and are 
provided with automatic bobbin doffing and donning 
apparatus. In the operations of, for example, ring spinning 
apparatus, the yarn passes from delivery rollers through 
a traveller to a yarn tube or bobbin, carried on the 
rotating spindle, on which the yarn is to be wound. The 
traveller is rotated around a traveller ring, which is 
coaxial with the spindle, by the pull of the yarn and 
either the spindle may gradually move axially relative to 
the ring or the ring to the spindle so that the yarn 
package is formed along the length of the tube on the 
spindle this movement being superimposed upon a relative 
reciprocating movement over the length of the nose of the 
package. When the package has reached its predetermined 
size it is known practice to move the rail carrying the 
ring (or the spindle) axially relative to the spindle or 
ring respectively so that a few turns of yarn are wound 
around an extension of the spindle below the tube. This 
is known as the underwind (undercoils or reserve 
windings). The yarn connecting the underwind and the full 
package must then be broken or severed to enable the full 
package to be cleanly removed from the spindle, or doffed. When the wound package is doffed and a fresh tube 
or bobbin is refixed on the spindle, the ring rail is 
moved back in position to form a new yarn package on the 
new tube. The yarn leading from the underwind is thus 
connected to the first few windings around the new tube,  
 
after which the connecting length of yarn is severed and 
the waste undercoil removed. It is time consuming to 
remove these underwinds but if they are allowed to 
accumulate, the spinning or winding operation can be 
disrupted. Apparatus for rupturing or severing the yarn 
between the bobbin and the undercoils is disclosed in our 
European Patent Application, No. EP-A-0304240, which 
discloses a yarn ring spinning apparatus in which a yarn 
severing device is positioned adjacent the axis of the 
spindle and between the reserve winding member, or sleeve, 
and an adjacent

<CLAIMS>
A textile yarn ring spinning or twisting apparatus 
comprising a spindle for carrying a yarn support tube or 

bobbin, the spindle being rotatable about its axis to 
enable yarn to be wound on the tube to form a yarn package, 

a yarn reserve winding member mounted coaxially with the 
spindle around which member yarn may be wound prior to the 

doffing of a wound yarn package from the spindle, and 
clutch means selectively to clutch the reserve winding 

member to the spindle so that with the clutch means in a 
first position the reserve winding member is constrained to 

rotate with the spindle and in a second position the 
reserve winding member is substantially disengaged from the 

spindle and free to rotate relative thereto. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the clutch 
means comprises complementary clutch surfaces mounted to, 

or formed integrally with, the reserve winding member and 
the spindle, means being provided to produce relative axial 

movement between the reserve winding member and spindle in 
order either to bring the complementary clutch surfaces 

into contact with each other or to move them apart so as to 
couple or to decouple, respectively, the reserve winding 

member and the spindle. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 comprising a 
blade mounted to the spindle in such a position as to sever 

the yarn extending between the bobbin or the spindle and 
the reserve winding member when the clutch means is in the 

second position and the reserve winding member is 
disengaged from the spindle. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 comprising a yarn 
locator to catch the yarn extending between the bobbin or 

the spindle and the reserve winding member when the clutch 
means is in the second position, the yarn locator being 

effective to bring the caught yarn against the edge of the 
blade so as to sever the yarn when the spindle is rotated 

relative to the reserve winding member. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the yarn 
locator is in the form of a gear wheel mounted to the 

reserve winding member. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the gear 
wheel is recessed and so configured as to act as a guard 

for the blade when the clutch means is in the first 
position. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim 
comprising means operable to stop, or to limit the extent 

of, rotation of the reserve winding member when the clutch 
means is in the second position. 
A method of doffing a fully-wound textile yarn 
package on a bobbin from a yarn ring spinning apparatus 

comprising the steps of coupling a reserve winding member 
so as to rotate coaxially with the spindle of the 

apparatus, winding a number of undercoils on the reserve 
winding member, uncoupling the reserve winding member from 

the spindle so that the spindle can be rotated relative to 
the reserve winding member in order to sever the yarn 

extending between the yarn package and the reseve winding 
member and doffing the yarn package. 
A method as claimed in Claim 8 comprising the steps 
of fixing a new bobbin tube onto the spindle and 

recommencing the yarn spinning operation whilst keeping the 
reserve winding member decoupled from the spindle and 

removing the waste undercoils from the reserve winding 
member.
