Process for multi-layered coating of strand-shaped metal 
material, preferably tape or wire, through application of 

different layers of metallic coating materials, with 
continuous passage of material to be coated through a 

device comprising several immersion-baths, arranged one 
behind another, with molten coating materials,
 
characterized in that
 
strand-shaped, metal material is directed, in a straight 

line, through equipment concerned, with temperature and 
time being regulated by means of bath temperatures and/or 

bath levels of different molten coating materials. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that
 
each layer of coating material applied onto strand-shaped 

metal material is cooled, in a following bath in a 
direction of passage, at a temperature equal to or below 

a hardening temperature of a lowest melting element of a 
previously applied layer. 
Process in accordance with claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
one or more layers applied onto strand-shaped metal 

material is or are exposed to a temperature in a 
following immersion bath, in a direction of passage, 

which is higher than a hardening temperature of a layer 
or layers applied in one of preceding immersion baths.  

 
Process in accordance with claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that
 
a last layer applied onto strand-shaped material, after 

leaving an immersion bath, is quickly cooled to a 
temperature at or below a hardening temperature of this 

layer and is then planished off by 0.3 to 3%. 
Equipment for carrying out a process in accordance with 
claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized by
 
several coating vessels (4a, 4b), arranged in a row, with 

through-channels (12) for strand-shaped material (B) 
below an immersion bath surface-level (h), where through-channels 

(12) are closed by magneto-hydrodynamic seals 
(13) and a temperature (T) and/or a surface-level (h) of 

a cooling material (31, 32, 33) can be adjusted in each 
coating vessel (4a, 4b). 
Equipment in accordance with claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
coating vessels (4a, 4b) are disposed vertically one 

above another. 
Equipment in accordance with claim 5 or 6,
 
characterized in that
 
each coating vessel (4a, 4b) has at least one initial-melting 

vessel associated with it, between which and a 
coating vessel (4a, 4b) molten coating material (31, 32, 

33) can be turned, with exclusion of air. 
Equipment in accordance with claim 7,
 
characterized in that
 
a coating vessel (4a, 4b) is developed several times 

smaller in volume than (an) initial melting vessel(s) 
associated with it.  

 
Equipment in accordance with claims 4 to 8,
 
characterized in that
 
strand-shaped, metal material (B) - as seen in a 

direction of passage - is directed around a guide roller 
(25), coming after a finishing frame (21) for a coated 

material (B), after a last (4b) or an additional coating 
vessel (22). 
Equipment in accordance with claim 9,
 
characterized in that,
 
with arrangement of a guide roller (25) in an additional 

coating vessel (22), strand-shaped material (B) is 
directed into an out of a surface of an immersion bath 

and a said guide roller (25) can be raised and lowered 
inside an immersion bath concerned.
