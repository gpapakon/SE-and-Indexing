<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method and a device for monitoring objects, such as tools for example, or process zones. A test pin (34) can be pivoted by an electric motor (20) in two pivoting directions, beginning from a zero position, with the result that two objects or process zones can be monitored. The zero position of the test pin (34) is determined by a microprocessor in a learning cycle from the desired angular value of a reference stop.

Method of monitoring objects, in particular tools, 
or processing zones, in which a stylus (34) is swivelled 

by an electric motor (20) drivable in both directions of 
rotation, a rotation sensor (38) determines the swivel 

angle of the stylus (34) relative to the zero position 
and a microcomputer (44) or a similar logic assembly 

compares the swivel angle with a required angular value, 
determined by a reference stop in a learning cycle and 

stored, and delivers a signal resulting from the comparison, 
characterized in that the rotation sensor (38) 

detects the swivelling direction of the stylus (34) and 
in that the zero position of the stylus (34) is defined 

by the microcomputer (44) or the similar logic assembly 
by calculation proceeding from the required angular value 

and is stored in the microcomputer (44) or the similar 
logic assembly. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that, 
in the learning cycle, the stylus (34) is first moved in 

one swivelling direction towards a first reference stop 
and then in the opposite swivelling direction to a second 

reference stop and in that the zero position is set 
between the required angular values of the two reference 

stops. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in -that 
the zero position is set in the centre between the 

required angular values of the two reference stops. 
Device for monitoring objects, in particular tools, 
or processing zones, comprising a stylus (34), comprising 

an electric motor (20) which swivels the stylus (34) and 
is drivable in both directions of rotation, comprising an 

incremental rotation sensor (38) which measures the 
swivelling angle of the stylus (34) and comprising a  

 
microcomputer (44) or a similar logic assembly which 

counts the swivelling angle of the stylus (34) proceeding 
from a zero position, compares it with a required angular 

value, determined by a reference stop in a learning cycle 
and stored, and delivers a signal (48, 50) resulting from 

the comparison, characterized in that the rotation sensor 
(38) is a rotation sensor which detects direction of 

rotation, in that the stylus (34) can be swivelled in 
both swivelling directions starting from the zero position 

and in that the zero position can be set and stored 
by the microcomputer (44) starting from the required 

angular value set by the reference stop. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
a reference stop is provided in each case in both 

swivelling directions of the stylus (34) and in that the 
required angular values of the two reference stops are 

storable in the microcomputer (44). 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the electric motor (20) is a direct-current motor 

controlled by the microcomputer (44).
