<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing antigen presentation is disclosed, wherein an antigen is modified by reaction with AGEs or a compound which forms AGEs. The AGEs are formed on or attached to the antigen, at a site which either activates an epitope containing the site of AGE attachment or formation, or which activates a different site in the antigen, a so-called "silent" epitope. This may comprise an actual activation process, a shift in the dominance to a different epitope by reducing recognition of the epitope upon which the AGEs are found or another mechanism. Also included are the antibodies which recognize these epitopes, methods of treatment and use, assay techniques and kits for performing such methods.

 METHODS AND AGENTS FOR MODULATING IMMUNE RESPONSE, ANDUSES THEREOFTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to the field of immunology and, more particularly, to the modulation of the immune response to a variety of antigens, including the enhancement of host immunocompetence and the preparation and administration of vaccines for prevention and treatment of disease states.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn general, antigens are "presented" to the immune system by antigen presenting cells (APCs) , including, for instance, macrophages and B-cells that work in conjuction with major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHCs) which are present on the APC surface. Normally, natural antigens and molecules supplied as immœçnogens are thought to be taken up and partially digested by the APCs, so that smaller pieces of the original antigen are then expressed on the cell surface in the context of MHC molecules.It is also presently understood that T-lymphocytes, in contrast to B-lymphocytes, are relatively unable to interact with soluble antigen. Typically T-lymphocytes require antigen to be processed and then expressed on the cell surface of APCs in the context of MHC molecules as noted above. Thus, T-cells, and more particularly, the so called "T-cell receptors," are able to recognize the antigen in the form of a bimolecular ligand composed of the processed antigen and one or more MHC molecules.It is also presently understood that T-lymphocytes, in contrast to B-lymphocytes, are relatively unable to interact with soluble antigen. Typically T-lymphocytes 

require antigen to be processed and then expressed on the cell surface of APCs in conjunction with MHC molecules as noted above. Thus, T-cells, and more particularly, the so called "T-cell receptors," are able to recognize the antigen in the form of a bimolecular ligand composed of the processed antigen and one or more MHC molecules.Many epitopes on proteins, including both foreign and endogenous proteins, while recognized are so dominated by the reactivity of other more active epitopes as to be relatively unrecognized or only weakly recognized by the immune system. These epitopes therefore appear to elicit little or no antibody or other immune response, and may elicit at most only a weak response. It has therefore been difficult or impossible, for instance, to raise antibodies against these protein epitopes. By contrast, the epitopes that elicit extraordinarily strong immune responses, in some instances, to the exclusion (or partial

1. A method of inducing a modified immune response to an antigen comprising reacting the antigen with an advanced glycosylation endproduct or a compound which forms advanced glycosylation endproducts in an amount sufficient to induce a modified immune response to said antigen.
2. A method in accordance with Claim 1 wherein the reaction increases the antigenicity of the epitope region on the antigen.
3. A method in accordance with Claim 1 wherein the reaction reduces the antigenicity of the epitope region on the antigen.
4. A method in accordance with Claim 1 further comprising modifying the antigenicity of the antigen to include a moiety capable of reacting to form an AGE on the antigen.
5. A method in accordance with Claim 4 wherein the moiety capable of reacting to form an AGE on the antigen is at least one member selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine and cysteine.
6. A method of modifying an immune response to a polypeptide comprising modifying an expression sequence which codes for the polypeptide to include at least one member selected from the group recited in Claim 5 in the polypeptide upon expression; expressing the modified polypeptide, and reacting the modified polypeptide with an AGE or a compound which forms AGEs in an amount effective for inducing a modified immune response to said polypeptide. 


 7. An antibody which recognizes an epitope on an antigenic molecule, said antigenic molecule having been reacted with an advanced glycosylation end product or a compound which forms advanced glycosylation end products in an amount effective for modifying the antigenicity of the antigen, said epitope being non-recognizable by the antibody in the absence of such reaction.
