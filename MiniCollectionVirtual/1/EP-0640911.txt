<ABSTRACT>
This method advantageously utilizes the resources of software programs stored in the external memory 
connected to the hardware main frame. The circuit device is for implementing this method. The method comprises 

an initialization routine (X) including a step of switching the bank of BIOS-ROM (13) in the main frame (1) having 
a CPU (11) to the bank of software programs stored in an external storage (2), a security check routine (Y) in which 

whether or not a software program is correct is checked, a routine (Z) in which a software program is executed by the 
CPU (11) in the main frame (1) when the software program is judged to be correct in the security check routine (Y). 

By resetting the CPU (11) while the bank is at least on the side of the software program which is stored in the external 
storage (2), the CPU (11) is released from the security check routine (Y), and can execute this software program by 

the routine (Z).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for executing a
software program according to the preamble of claim 1 or to a circuit equipment according to the preamble of claim 4. More
particularly, it relates to a method for executing a software
program, which is advantageous to use assets of software
programs accumulated in an external memory detachably connected
to the hardware equipment and a circuit for performing
the method.In recent years, a software program is supplied, in
various kinds of forms, for example, ROM cartridge, floppy
disk and so on, for use in hardware equipment exclusively
provided in a micro computer, according to the spread of the
micro computer.Further, it is general to perform a security check on a
software program to prevent an illegally copied/created
software program from being used in the hardware equipment.Various kinds of the methods for checking the security
for the software program, have been proposed in, for example, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,442,486 (corresponding to
Japanese laid-open Patent
Publication No. 101349/1983), U.S. Patent No. 4,462,076 and
U.S. Patent No. 5,155,768 (corresponding to Japanese
laid-open Patent Publication No. 266051/1991).In the method described in U.S. Patent No. 4,462,076, the
content of a fixed address in the memory of a game cartridge,
which is detachably connected to console equipment, in which
a CPU is provided, is compared with the security message
stored in the CPU of the console equipment. As the result of
this comparison, if the correspondence is not detected, the
cartridge is refused to accept, that is, the program stored
in the memory of the cartridge cannot be executed.In the method described in the U.S. Patent No. 4,422,486,
when a device installed with a program is connected to the
console equipment, a message corresponding to the signal
obtained from the device is indicated on display
equipment. That is, a fixed message, for example, "This
equipment uses the invention of the patent application filed
in D/M/Y", or the like is displayed. If it is different
from the indication of the message, it is controlled so as to
be prohibited to use the device providing the program after
then.Further, in the method described in the U.S. Patent No.
5,155,768, a security circuit provided in the console
equipment is initialized when the power of the console equipment
is ON. The console equipment is made possible to 
operate by a signal generating due to the initialization of
the security circuit.Whenever the security circuit is accessed, the security
