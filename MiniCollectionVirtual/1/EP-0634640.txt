<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of quantitating 
reticulocytes in blood. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a method and apparatus for quantitating 
reticulocytes with the aid of a dye suited for staining 
the ribonucleic acid (RNA) component of the 
reticulocytes. The immature erythrocytes in blood are called 
reticulocytes and the reticulocyte count is considered 
to be a laboratory parameter of great significance in 
the diagnosis of acute internal hemorrhage and hemolytic 
anemia, among other diseases. This is because 
reticulocytes serve as an indicator of blood cell 
production (erythrocyte differentiation). It is also known that the reticulocyte has RNA,and 
in the determination of reticulocytes, it is common 
practice to stain a blood smear with new methylene blue 
(NMB), brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) or the like and 
count the stained reticulocytes under the microscope. 
There also are alternative procedures, either manual or 
automatic, which employ fluorescent dyes such as 
acrydine orange, pyronine Y, thioflavin T, auramine O, 
thiazole orange and so on.  The ultravital staining technique using new 
methylene blue has been employed as the standard method 
for enumerating reticulocytes but being a manual 
procedure, this technique is time-consuming and complicated 
and has the drawback of individual difference 
according to different observers. The determination technique employing acrydine 
orange is either manual or automatic as disclosed in, 
interalia, US Patents 4336029, 4325706 and 4284412. 
Thus, acrydine orange couples itself to the RNA component 
of reticulocytes to produce a red fluorescence 
and the number of reticulocytes is determined by 
measuring the emissions. However, the RNA in precipitated 
by acrydine orange and localized within the cell 
so that the quantitation of fluorescence tends to lack 
accuracy. Moreover, because this dye has a high 
affinity for the quartz cell and plastic materials 
constituting the circuitry of a flow cytometer. Determination with pyronine Y requires a prior 
formalin fixation of red blood cells band is disadvantageous 
in that the technique is complicated and 
time-consuming. Furthermore, the fluorescent quantum 
efficiency of pyronine Y is so low that no sufficient 
sensitivity can be expected. Thioflavin T is disclosed in Japanese Patent  
 
Application Kokai S-59-142465 as a reticulocyte stain 
but since it requires sufficient washing for reducing 
the noise of nonspecific fluorescence, determination 
with this dye has the
