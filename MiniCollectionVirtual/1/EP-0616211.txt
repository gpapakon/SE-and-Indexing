source (22), a capillary tube (23) and a photoelectric detector (24). The arrangement of the 

light source (22) relative to the capillary tube (23) is such, that probing light (P) emitted 
from the light source (22) strikes a sample (S) to be analyzed, which is flowing through 

the capillary tube (23), whereas the photoelectric detector (24) is arranged relative to the 
capillary tube (23) such, that it is capable of detecting light comming from the capillary 

tube. The photoelectric detector (24) is connected with an evaluation electronics. Between 
the light source (22) and the capillary tube (23)the probing light (P) is guided essentially 

in a guiding means (26) which is made of a material having a refractive index gradient 
about perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the probing light (P), and which is 

connected to the capillary tube (23) such that probing light (P) exiting the guiding 
material (26) strikes the capillary tube (23). Preferably light emitting diodes (LEDs) or 

laser diodes are used as light source (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical detection arrangement for small volume chemical
analysis of fluid samples, as used for example in Capillary Electrophoresis (CE), in
Micro-Column Chromatography, or in Capillary Chromatography, more particularly in
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), according to the precharacterizing
clause of patent claim 1.Capillary Electrophoresis (CE), Micro-Column Chroatography and Capillary
Chromatography, more particularly High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC),
are well known techniques for liquid-phase chemical separation in small volume chemical
analysis. There exists a great demand for improvements of the instrumental set-ups for
these separation techniques, in order to achieve better separation results or a socalled
higher number of theoretical plates, faster analysis times and lower reagent consumptions.
Among the various aspects contributing to the overall performance in Capillary
Electrophoresis (CE) and Micro-column and Capillary Chromatography (HPLC), the
detection, which is most commonly performed by optical methods, is a very important
one. There exists a great demand to be able to detect the substances of interest within
nano-liter or even pico-liters volumes. Detection represents thus the main obstacle in the
quest for higher miniaturization for small volume chemical analysis.In Capillary Electrophoresis for example, to preserve the spatial profile of the eluting
substances and, considering that the total volume of the separation stage, including the
detection arrangement, is usually less than a milliliter, dead-volumes must be avoided.
Under these circumstances it was found that meaningful results can only be achieved by
on-column detection. This is also the case in HPLC. From the prior art several
arrangements for on-column optical detection are known. These include detection
arrangements for absorption, fluorescence, and refractive index measurements, as are 
described for example in N. J. Dovichi, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 61, 3653 (1990). There is,
however, a growing demand to improve the sensitivity of those detection systems, to
reduce their detection volumes while at the same time retaining the instrumental
sensitivity.Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) detection is, to date, considered to be one of the most
sensitive detection methods for chemical separations in capillary tubes. However, even
fluorescence detection methods based on conventional arc or filament lamps as excitation
sources are suitable, although they are less sensitive.JOURNAL OF
