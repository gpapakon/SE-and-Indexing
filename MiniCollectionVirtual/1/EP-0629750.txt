<ABSTRACT>
A sealing device comprises a body which consists of a foam or a foam band which exhibits through-pores, preferably of rectangular cross-section and is laid on the concrete surface, with the result that the through-passage duct for a sealing medium is formed through the body itself, the sealing medium emerging out of the through-pores into the joint region. In the case of a process for introducing a sealing medium into sealing devices, after setting up the second concreting section, a connection is provided, in particular by drilling, between the outer side of the concrete and the sealing devices, through which connection the sealing medium is introduced into the interior of the sealing devices.

A process for sealing a gap between two structural bodies 
by injecting a sealing medium, in particular for sealing a gap 

between two concreting sections, a body forming a passage as an 
injection path for a sealing medium being mounted in the gap 

region on one structural body surface, from which body the 
sealing medium is pressed out of the body into defects in the gap 

region when said sealing medium is injected into the body, 
characterized in that a body (102) of a foam material having 

through-pores for the sealing medium or a foam strip is used. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that a foam 
material or a foam strip is used which on the one hand is 

sufficiently porous for the sealing medium to pass through, and 
on the other hand is of a consistency which, to the greatest 

possible extent, prevents the foam material or the foam strip 
from being compressed by the concrete of the second concreting 

section which is applied. 
A process according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterized in 
that for the body (102) a material is used in which there are the 

through-pores necessary for the sealing medium to pass through, 
even when the material is compressed to a relatively great 

extent. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a body (102) having a rectangular cross 

section is used. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a body (102) is used in the cross-sectional 

interior of which at least one continuous, free through-channel 
(106a) running in the longitudinal direction is provided for the 

sealing medium.  
 
A process according to Claim 5, characterized in that a body 
(102) is used whereof the through-channel (106a) is formed by a 

continuous cutout. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a body (102) is used which has at least in 

certain regions on its upper side remote from the concrete 
surface (101) a cover which is impermeable to the sealing medium 

or a coating which is impermeable to the sealing medium. 
A process according to Claim 7, characterized in that a body 
(102) is used whereof the cover or coating is of a relatively 

hard foam material. 
A process according to Claim 7 and/or 8, characterized in 
that a body (102) is used in which a cover or a coating ends 

somewhat before the underside (105) of the body (102). 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that connecting elements having the same cross-sectional 

shape and made of the same material are used to connect 
at least two bodies (102). 
A process according to Claim 10, characterized in that 
connecting pieces (114), angle brackets (115), upright angle 

brackets (116), T-pieces (117) or cross-pieces (118) are used as 
connecting elements. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that an adhesive tape is used to connect two 

bodies (102) together, or to connect the bodies (102) to the 
connecting elements according to Claim 10 and/or 11. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that a body (102) and/or connecting elements 

according to Claim 10 or 11 are used, which have V-shaped, notch-type 
incisions running over their entire cross-sectional width  

 
and arranged next to one another in the longitudinal direction, 

transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis, the notch 
point (126) of each incision being arrang
ed somewhat below the 
cross-sectional height of the bodies (102) or the connecting 

elements. 
A process according to Claim 13, characterized in that the 
bodies (102) or the connecting elements according to Claim 10 or 

11 are bent about their longitudinal axis and are secured to a 
curved surface (101) or to an arcuate or circular element, for 

example a pipe, the notch edge face (127) of the notches (125) 
abutting against one another when the underside (105) of the body 

(102) or of the connecting elements bears against the surface 
(101) of the element. 
A process according to Claim 13 and/or 14, characterized in 
that a continuous rubber band surrounds the bodies (102) and/or 

the connecting elements, the rubber band being arranged on the 
upper side of the bodies (102) or connecting elements. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the bodies (102) or the connecting elements 

are used to seal a groundwater discharge connection piece (131), 
a ring being formed which surrounds the groundwater discharge 

connection piece in the region in which it penetrates a base 
plate (132) made of concrete. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the bodies or the connecting elements are 

used to seal a gap region between a body, for example a pipe, and 
a concrete section. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the bodies or the connecting elements are 

used to seal a connecting point between two pipes (134, 135, 
136).  

 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 18, 
characterized in that, to introduce the sealing medium into the 

sealing device after the installation of the sealing device and 
the subsequent setting and shuttering of the second connecting 

section, at least one connection is made between an outer side 
of the concrete and the sealing device, in particular by drilling 

into the set concrete, via which connection the sealing medium 
is introduced into the interior of the sealing device.
