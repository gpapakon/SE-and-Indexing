<CLAIMS>
Solution of a gaseous hydride in liquid
nitrogen, the said hydride being chosen from the group

consisting of arsine, germane, phosphine, diborane,
monosilane and disilane, the concentration of the said

hydride in the liquid nitrogen being between 0.05 mol%
and 10 mol%.
Solution according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the concentration of the said hydride in the

liquid nitrogen is between 0.05 mol% and 2 mol%,
preferably between 0.1 mol% and 0.3 mol%.
Solution according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that it is packaged in a vessel such

as a container, a tank or a bottle, of the type used to
store liquid nitrogen.
Solution according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the hydride is monosilane (SiH
4
).
Use of a solution as claimed according to one
of Claims 1 to 4, for the preparation of heat-treatment

atmospheres, in particular for the heat-treatment of
metals.
Use of a solution as claimed according to one
of Claims 1 to 4, for the preparation of an

inertization atmosphere.
Use of a solution as claimed according to one
of Claims 1 to 4, for the preparation of an atmosphere

intended for surface treatment, in particular of
polymer or metal surfaces.
