<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene. 1,4-Dicyano-2-butene is 
useful as a material for synthesizing hexamethylenediamine, 
which is a material for 6,6-nylon and other 
products. Several processes are known which may be used 
for producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene from butene 
derivatives and hydrogen cyanide. (1) GB No. 1,384,796 
discloses a process for producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene 
which comprises reacting 2-butene-1,4-diol with hydrogen 
cyanide in a gas phase by using a catalyst comprising a 
cuprous halide supported on silica gel or the like. (2) 
German Patent No. 2,144,390 discloses a process for 
producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene by reacting 2-butene-1,4-diol 
with hydrogen cyanide in an aqueous phase in the 
presence of a catalyst comprising cuprous bromide and an 
alkali metal bromide. (3) USP No. 3,711,527 discloses a 
process for producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene by reacting 
1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene with hydrogen cyanide in a liquid 
in the presence of a catalyst comprising a cuprous 
halide and a non-aromatic amine hydrohalide. However, the aforesaid processes are all not  
 
fully satisfactory from the industrial viewpoint. The 
process (1) forms a large amount of impurities and gives 
a low yield. The process (2) shows a poor volume 
efficiency (that is, the ratio of the amount of the 
product formed to the total volume of the reaction 
system). The process (3) shows a low selectivity to the 
intended product. An object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene in 
a high yield and in an industrially advantageous way. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the description that 
follows. The present inventors have made extensive 
study on the process for producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene 
by the reaction of butene derivatives with hydrogen 
cyanide and resultantly found that a process which uses 
a catalyst comprising a product prepared from a cuprous 
halide, a non-aromatic amine hydrohalide and at least 
one member selected from the group consisting of Lewis 
acids and basic compounds can achieve the above-mentioned 
objects. The present invention has been 
attained on the basis of above finding. Thus, according to the present invention, 
there is provided a process for producing 1,4-dicyano-2-butene 
which comprises reacting a butene derivative  
 
represented by the formula [1] 
R1-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-R2 
or the formula [2] 
R3-CH2-CHR4-CH=CH2 
wherein R1 and R3 are the same or
