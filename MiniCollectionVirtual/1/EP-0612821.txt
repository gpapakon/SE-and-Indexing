pigment dispersant useful in water-borne and high-solids coatings 

and its composition is disclosed. Specifically, triethylene

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of dispersing
carbon black in a way such that it is useful in water-borne and
high-solids coatings compositions.In the practice of manufacturing pigmented paints, a
dispersion process is required during which pigments are
deagglomerated or otherwise dispersed into a finely divided and
smooth, pasty form. If proper dispersion is not affected, the
resultant paints will be dull in gloss, rough, and their physical
properties will be less than optimal, often failing to adhere to
the substrate sought to be coated. Thus, the dispersion process
is essential to good paint manufacturing practices.Pigment dispersants are commonly used in the coatings
industry to "wet" and "disperse" air or moisture from pigment
particle surfaces to facilitate mechanical separation of the
primary particles. They are also used to disperse the particles
into the body of the liquid and to keep them from coagulating.
The most common types of non-ionic wetting agents are polyalkoxy
ethers, such as high molecular weight polyethylene oxide or its
derivatives.A conventional dispersion technique for high gloss systems
is through the use of a ball mill. It is a batch process and has
been widely used to disperse a wide variety of pigments, 
including titanium dioxide (TiO2) and carbon black pigments.
Grinding times vary from several hours to up to several
days, depending upon the grinding technique, the nature of
the pigment structures, the pigment particle sizes and the
efficacy of the dispersant used. The dispersant is
essential to good grinding in that it functions as a wetting
agent for the pigment particles allowing them to be
stabilized once they have become dedispersed by the physical
grinding action. Carbon black, however, normally has a very
small particle size, and thus, a high surface area per unit
weight. Furthermore, it is difficult to wet due to its non-polar
nature. Thus, carbon black is one of the, if not the,
most difficult pigment to disperse. A wetting dispersant
stabilizing carbon black dispersions and yet possessing low
hydrophilicity has been long sought.JP-A-50-078630 discloses the use of naphthenic acid as
a dispersing agent for carbon black while EP-A-0 052224
discloses the use of mono and oligo ethylene glycol as for
the same purpose. There is no disclosure regarding
mechanisms by which these compounds act as dispersing agents
in either of these references.Carbon black pigments are made with small particle size
to make them conductive. The small particles agglomerate
easily
