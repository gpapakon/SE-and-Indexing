<ABSTRACT>
A computer installation is programmed for storing data in a 
magnetic disk DASD (direct access storage device) in the form of a 

track number identified by DASD cylinder number (CC) and DASD head 
number (HH). A re-writable, multi-disk optical storage which stores 

information in a fixed-block architecture including a sequence of 
sectors having the form of spirals on optical disk surfaces is enabled 

to emulate magnetic DASD by calculation-based conversion of storage 
references to magnetic DASD tracks to fixed-block optical sectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to the storage of data in a computer 
system, and more particularly to the emulation of direct access 
magnetic disk storage by means of fixed block architecture optical 
storage. More particularly, the invention concerns the conversion of a 
direct access magnetic storage data recording format to a direct access 
optical storage recording format to permit fixed block optical storage 
to emulate magnetic storage. As is known, large computer installations employ direct access 
storage device (DASD) subsystems for fast, efficient, and economical 
storage of data in a device which records and retrieves data in 
response only to a reference of the data's location. The principal 
device which supports direct access storage is a disk. The most widely 
used disk technology in present-day computer installations employs a 
rigid magnetic disk on which data is written magnetically in a location 
format based upon parallel tracks in the form of concentric rings on 
each surface of the disk. Typically, a hard disk drive will contain 
one or more disks and will provide for the independent, direct 
accessing of each surface of each disk. In a multi-disk DASD, each 
surface of each disk is accessed by a respective head/actuator assembly 
so that identification of particular head identifies a particular disk 
surface. Within a multi-disk DASD, the set of all tracks of the same 
nominal circumference form a "cylinder". Thus, each track of a 
multi-disk DASD can be uniquely identified by a cylinder number (CC) 
and a head number (HH). A two-dimensional track address CC HH permits a 
track to be directly accessed by moving an identified head (HH) to the 
circumferential location of an identified cylinder (CC). Fixed block architecture (FBA) optical storage is receiving 
increasing attention as a complement to, or a substitute for, magnetic 
DASD. FBA optical storage possesses a greater storage capacity than 
magnetic DASD in bits per storage area (areal density) and provides 
access to stored data at a speed that is somewhat slower than that 
provided by magnetic DASD. As is known, the use of magneto-optical 
technology supports a re-writable FBA optical storage which includes 
all of the storage features enjoyed by magnetic DASD. Computer installation considerations may make it desirable to 
utilize re-writable FBA optical storage in place of magnetic DASD.  
 
However, the I/O (input/output) configuration of virtually all modern 
computer installations is based upon the magnetic DASD track
