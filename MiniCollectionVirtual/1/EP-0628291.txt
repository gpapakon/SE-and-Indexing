<ABSTRACT>
A tooth-brush has a brush shank (4) adapted to be driven electrically by a 
drive means (2) and provided with a brush-head (5) having bristles (6), which brush-head 

performs a so-called loosening movement (8) whose frequency is higher than 
30 Hz and whose amplitude is between 0.1 mm and 5 mm, which brush-head performs 

an additional, so-called wiping movement (9) having a frequency of between 1 Hz and 5 
Hz. The combination of a rapid loosening movement and a slow wiping movement 

ensures that the teeth are cleaned in a thorough but gentle manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tooth-brush having a brush shank adapted to be
driven electrically by a drive means and provided with a brush-head having bristles, which
brush-head performs
two superimposed movements.Such a tooth-brush is known from US-A-3577579. The combined
movement of the brush-head results in an orbital movement at the outer tips of the bristles.
The drive of the brush-head is such that the frequencies of both movement are the same.
However, the magnitude of the frequency is not indicated.For cleaning the teeth, in order to loosen dental film or plaque on the
tooth surfaces, numerous electrically driven toothbrushes are available, performing different
brushing movements. These vary from a planar elliptical movement of the bristle ends with a
major axis of approximately 2 mm and a minor axis of approximately 10 mm, via an
oscillatory movement of the brush surface about the longitudinal axis of the handle, and a
combination of an oscillatory movement and a short axial movement of 1-2 mm, to a rotation
of cylindrical tufts of bristles about their longitudinal axes. A further group of electrically
driven mechanical tooth-cleaning appliances effects cleaning by a rotation of the individual
tufts of bristles and/or a combination of this movement with a pivotal movement of the entire
brush. The movement frequency is generally between 20 and 50 Hz.As a result of the rapid reciprocatory movement of the brush the cleaning
action is effective only at those spots which as a rule are readily accessible at any rate, i.e.
the surfaces of the teeth.The combination of large amplitudes with brush movement frequencies of
between 20 and 50 Hz leads to the following symptoms or drawbacks:
At step-like surface structures, for example at the transition between the
gingival border and the tooth, blind corners are formed where the bristle ends
do not reach the surface to be cleaned. As a result, these areas are not cleaned
or not cleaned properly.Owing to the large amplitude associated with the high frequency the brush
behaves as a brush whose individual filaments are less flexible and dynamically 
stiffer. The maximum force exerted on, for example, the gums then exceeds the
now generally accepted permissible value of approximately 2 N and leads to
gum injury.Some of the bristles get caught and are almost immobilised, exerting an
impermissible pressure on the gums when the brush passes through the centre
position.The interdental spaces are not cleaned satisfactorily because the bristles do not
reach into the

A tooth-brush having a brush shank (4) adapted to be driven electrically
by a drive means (2) and provided with a brush-head (5) having bristles (6), which brush-head

(5) performs two superimposed movements (8,9), characterised in that the frequency of
one of the movements, a so-called loosening movement (8) is higher than 30 Hz, the

amplitude of this loosening movement (8) is between 0.1 mm and 5 mm, and that the other
movement, a so-called wiping movement (9) has a frequency between 1 Hz and 5 Hz.
A tooth-brush as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the loosening
movement (8) is a rectilinear reciprocating movement in the direction of the longitudinal axis

(28) of the brush shank (4) with a frequency of between 60 Hz and 70 Hz and an amplitude
of approximately 2 mm, and in that the wiping movement (9) is an oscillatory movement

about the longitudinal axis (28) of the brush shank (4) with a frequency of between 2 Hz and
3 Hz and with an overall angular excursion of 10° to 30°.
A tooth-brush as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the brush shank
is adapted to be coupled to a tooth-brush shaft (3) which is drivable by an electric motor

(10), which tooth-brush shaft (3) is drivable in the direction of the oscillatory movement (49)
and in the direction of the reciprocating movement (48) by means of an eccentric mechanism,

which eccentric mechanism comprises two eccentric pins (15,24) which are each guided in a
recess (27,30) in the tooth-brush shaft (3/25,26) to drive the tooth-brush shaft (3) in the

direction of the oscillatory movement (48) and in the direction of the reciprocating movement
(49), respectively, and each have a speed corresponding to said frequency.
A tooth-brush as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that a reduction
mechanism (11,12; 17,22) is provided between the two eccentric pins (15,24).

mechanism is formed by a two-stage eccentric planetary gear mechanism.

mechanism is formed by a worm gear mechanism (37,38).
