<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a refuse bin grabbing apparatus for grabbing a bin for movement to an elevated unloading position for emptying into a refuse truck including a power-driven linkage (5) for moving a bin-grasping clamp (2, 3) towards inter-engagement with a refuse bin, the grasping clamp including articulated clamping arms (3) for embracing a refuse bin, the arms being fitted with a flexible belt (6) located between the clamping arms and a bin to be clamped so that the belt is tensioned in the bin-engaging position; the articulated clamping arms are retractable to an out-of-the-way position to ensure that the clamping arms (3) do not prodrude from the outer confines of the vehicle in the rest position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refuse bin grabbing apparatus,
particularly a so-called side lift system. Systems of this type are described in our
earlier patent application No. 60231/90 first filed 8th August, 1989.A major advantage of this system is the possibility of single man operation
of the motor vehicle, loading of the contents of a refuse bin and restoring the
refuse bin to its original position without the operator leaving his driving position.Other prior art known to the Applicant includes Australian Petty Patent No.
629165 disclosing hydraulically actuated grab fingers for a refuse bin. US
Patent No. 3762586 discloses articulated arms on a front loading refuse vehicle.US Patent No. 4401407 discloses a grasping arm on a refuse collection
vehicle with an inner arm pivotally mounted on a frame with an outer arm
pivoted between its ends to the inner arm. The outer arm is hydraulically moved
graspingly in response to movement of the inner arm by a linkage mechanism.
The grasping arm is adapted for grasping containers of varying shapes and
sizes.Australian Patent Application 634439 discloses gripping apparatus for a
refuse bin including pivotal arm means and a flexible element for gripping a
refuse bin.Australian Patent No. 521074 discloses hydraulically actuated fixed arms
pivoted at a shoulder pivot.US Patent No. 3172693 discloses a barrel grab assembly suitable for a
fork lift truck.Australian lapsed Application No. 75458/81 discloses a side loader with
grasping arms pivoted at a shoulder joint.US Patent No. 4227850 discloses a paper roll handling clamp for lift
trucks with pivoting clamp arms.US Patent No. 4461608 discloses a handling apparatus for a rear-loading
refuse truck with a pair of pivotal clamping arms.Australian Application No. 82407/82 discloses pivotal grab arms for a
container pick-up vehicle.US Patent No. 4281956 discloses a front-loading grabber apparatus with 
pivoting arms.US Patent No. 3165348 discloses an articulated grabbing arm
mechanism with padding thereon for grasping logs, barrels and pipes, etc.
US-A-5209537 being published after the priority date of the present application
discloses an articulated grabbing arm mechanism having essentially rigid, non-flexible
article grabbing means. US-A-5020844 discloses a gripping apparatus with pivoting
arms which are not individually articulated.None of the prior art known to the Applicant appears to address the
problem of engaging closely-spaced bins and achieving full retraction of the
grabbing arms in an out-of-the-way
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A remote control refuse bin grabbing apparatus
for grabbing and moving of a bin to an elevated unloading

position, the apparatus having a power driven linkage
arranged to move bin engaging means into engagement with the

bin, said bin engaging means having support means (1) upon
which each clamping arm (2, 3) of a pair of foldable clamping arms (2,3) is pivotally

mounted, each clamping arm (2, 3) including a shoulder member (2)
mounted for pivotal movement about the support means (1),

and a forward arm member (3) pivotally joined to the
shoulder member (2) and a separate link (5) extending

between the respective forward arm member (3) and the
support means (1), the arrangement of clamping arms (2, 3) and

support means (1) being such that the clamping arms (2, 3) may each be
folded

such that one clamping arm (2, 3) lies on one side and the other
clamping arm (2, 3)

lies on the opposite side of the support means (1) when in
the rest position from which they may be unfolded to project

and receive the bin, wherein the folding and unfolding movement of the
clamping arms (2, 3) is controlled by the

links (5) to promote an outward projection of the clamping
arms (2,3) from the support means (1)

wherein lateral movement of the clamping arms (2, 3) is reduced
to a minimum

to receive the bin and
said clamping arms (2, 3) include flexible belt means (6) arranged to engage

the bin under the tension caused by said clamping arms
moving the belt means (6) into embracing engagement with the

bin.
An apparatus according to claim 1, including a
power cylinder (8) for each clamping arm (2,3) arranged to

move each clamping arm (2, 3) between said rest position and a
position wherein said clamping arms (2, 3) embrace the bin.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein each

power cylinder (8) extends between the support means (1) and
a respective clamping arm (2). 
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the belt means comprise a belt (6) extending between the

outward end of each respective
clamping arm (3) and the support means (1) or the inward

portion of the clamping arm.
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
each power cylinder (8) extends between and is pivotally

joined to both the respective shoulder member (2) and the
support means (1).
