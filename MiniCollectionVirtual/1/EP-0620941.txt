<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a die cutting press 
and, more particularly, to a registration system for registering defined areas 
of web, strip or sheet material with a die unit provided on the cutting press 
in order to permit accurate cutting of the material. A die cutting press is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,555,968, 
to Raney. The press disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,555,968 has a shiftable 
die unit supported on a cushion of air, and the die unit is movable laterally 
of the direction of travel of the web or strip as well as rotatably about an 
upright axis perpendicular to the material in order to bring the die unit into 
precise registration with defined areas of the material to be processed or cut 
by the press. Automatic operation of this known press is provided by a 
control system having two groups of photo-optical sensors which are 
disposed to detect the presence of two T-shaped marks provided on  
 
opposite sides of the material adjacent each defined area to be cut. The 
control system is electrically coupled to servomotor mechanisms for 
adjustably positioning the die unit once advancement of the material is 
interrupted and a defined area on the material is in general proximity to 
work structure of the press die unit. Although a die cutting press having an automatic die 
registration system, as illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,555,968, represents 
a significant advance in the art, it would be desirable to increase the 
operational speed of such a press so that greater amounts of material can 
be processed. However, it is important that extreme registration accuracy 
of the die unit with the defined areas be maintained so that the defined 
areas are precisely severed from the material within very small dimensional 
tolerances. As shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,697,485, to Raney, a die cutting 
press is provided with a registration system which is operable to provide 
precise alignment of a shiftable die cutting unit along two axes during the 
time that the material is advanced along a third axis toward the die unit, so 
that as soon as a defined area of the material reaches the die unit, the press 
can be immediately actuated to subject the material to the die cutting 
operation. Continuous monitoring of an elongated indicator strip provided 
on the material enables the die unit to be shifted as necessary during travel  
 
to insure lateral and angular registration prior to the time that material 
advancement is interrupted. The registration system as illustrated in U.S.
