<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a variable range 
position indicator and associated circuitry for supplying 
a variable signal to a computer indicating 
the degree of displacement of a controlled element. 
In specific embodiments of the invention, the position 
indicator is a joystick, trackball, mouse, or 
similar signal input device. Many personal computers include input ports for 
joysticks, trackballs, and mice. Each of these input 
devices controls a variable signal indicating 
the position or displacement of some element. The 
input devices are employed in playing computer games 
or supplying input information to the computer. Figure 1 is a perspective view of a conventional 
joystick 1 intended for use with IBM and IBM compatible 
computers. The joystick 1 includes a housing 
2 that forms the base of the joystick and a 
shaft 3 that is gimbaled so that the shaft of the 
joystick may be displaced by pivoting about two orthogonal 
axes. Generally, the joystick includes a 
"home" position for the shaft so that signals are 
provided that indicate the displacement of the shaft 
3 relative to the home position. In many joysticks, 
a mechanical release permits the shaft to "float" 
and move in any direction without restraint or returning 
to a home position. Figure 2 is an internal view of the housing 2 
schematically indicating the mechanical elements of  
 
the joystick 1. Electrical interconnections are not 
shown. The joystick includes X and Y potentiometers 
10 and 11, i.e., resistors with movable contacts. 
Each potentiometer includes a rotatable shaft for 
moving the contact along the fixed resistance element 
between the input and output terminals of the 
potentiometer. The joystick shaft is mounted on a 
portion of a gimbaled sphere 12. Displacement of 
the joystick in the X direction causes pivoting of a 
U-shaped member 13 that is pivotally supported at 
its opposite ends. That member 13 is mechanically 
connected to the X potentiometer 10 so that displacement 
of the joystick shaft 3 in the X direction 
causes a rotation of the shaft of the X potentiometer 
10 and, thereby, of the position of the variable 
position contact of the potentiometer 10. Likewise, 
displacement of the shaft 3 along the Y direction 
causes pivoting of a second support member 14 that 
is pivotally mounted on the U-shaped member 13. The 
support member 14 is mechanically connected to the 
shaft of the Y potentiometer 11 so that a Y direction 
displacement of the joystick shaft 3 rotates 
the shaft of the Y
