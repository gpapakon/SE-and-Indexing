<ABSTRACT>
Innerboot particularly usable for sports shoes such as ski boots, roller skates or ice skates, including a plurality of separate soft elements (3, 4, 8, 9) which are individually molded. The separate soft elements are associable inside the shoe so as to surround the foot and part of the user's leg. A product comparable to a stitch-free innerboot is thus obtained starting from individual elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
INNERBOOT FOR SPORTS SHOES Technical FieldThe present invention relates to an innerboot for sports shoes, such as for example ski boots, roller skates or ice skates. Background ArtIt is in fact currently known to use innerboots arranged inside ski boots and said skates, which substantially have the purpose of improving comfort for the user.It is known to manufacture innerboots for ski boots which are obtained from a single film of thermoplastic material, molded so as to obtain two halves of the innerboot, as seen in a top plan view.However, these conventional innerboots and the related method for manufacturing them have some drawbacks: first of all it is necessary to weld the two halves of the innerboot through a further manufacturing step, with a consequent increase in the overall production cost.Innerboots for ski boots are also known which are obtained by means of the following method: two half- innerboots, which match the vertical central cross-section of the outer boot, are hot-molded by means of vacuum or pressure stretch-forming, against a respective concave or convex mold, of portions of a strip of partially cross- linked closed-cell foamed material, or by means of injection between two parts of a mold. The half-innerboots, after the leveling of their edges, are glued or welded together.Even this solution has drawbacks: the innerboot obtained requires a glueing or welding step, and thus has 

discontinuous regions which can cause discomfort for the user. Furthermore, this method does not allow to control the thickness in the case of blow-molding, because the thickness is lower where the material is stretched the most. It is also known to manufacture innerboots from a single element obtained by foaming or thermoforming or by injection. These innerboots require an internal lining which is inserted at the adapted last which forms the mold. Once the innerboot has been extracted, it is necessary to finish it by perimetrically stitching the lining to it. The lining is then folded for final finishing at the perimetric edges of the rear opening of said innerboot.Therefore, these solutions too have drawbacks, because they require manufacturing steps such as the insertion of the lining in the last of the mold and the various stitching operations.Disclosure of the InventionThe aim of the present invention is to eliminate the drawbacks described above in known types by providing an innerboot which allows to ensure a considerable degree of comfort to a user once the ski boot or skate has been put on, said

 CLAIMS
1. Innerboot for sports shoes, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of separate soft elements (3,4,8,9, 103,104,109) which are individually molded flat or semi-flat and are associable inside said sports shoe so as to surround the foot and part of the user's leg. 2. Innerboot according to claim 1, characterized in that each one of said separate soft elements which form said innerboot affect a particular region of the user's foot and leg. 3. Innerboot according to claim 2, characterized in that said separate elements comprise a first element, such as a plantar insert (3), on which the foot rests and above which it is possible to arrange a second element (4) surrounding the front and lateral region of the foot. 4. Innerboot according to claim 3, characterized in that said second element (4) has first lower perimetric edges (5) which can be arranged outside second lateral perimetric edges (6) of said first element. 5. Innerboot according to claim 4, characterized in that said second element has a recess (7) at the foot instep region. 6. Innerboot according to claim 5, characterized in that a third element, such as a tongue (8) suitable to affect the entire foot instep region of the user and part of the tibial region, can be arranged at said recess. 7. Innerboot according to claim 6, characterized in that said separate elements comprise a fourth element, such as a flap (9) surrounding the user's leg to the rear and 


has third lower perimetric edges (10) which can be arranged adjacent to said second lateral perimetric edges (6) of said first element in the heel region (11) . 8. Innerboot according to claim 7, characterized in that said fourth element (9) is connected, at fourth lateral perimetric edges, on the outside of adapted wings which protrude from fifth rear perimetric edges (12) of said second element (4) . 9. Innerboot according to claim 8, characterized in that a seat (17) for an insert (18) is formed at the lateral surface (16) proximate to the upper end of said flap. 10. Innerboot according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that said second element (104) affects the front and side region of the foot and has, at fifth rear perimetric edges (114), an adapted wing (113) which can be arranged at an adapted opening (120) formed frontally with respect to a fourth element (109), such as a flap, which frontally surrounds the user's leg and laterally surrounds the malleoli. 11. Innerboot according to claim 10, characterized in that said fourth element (109) is connected, in a downward region, at third lower perimetric edges (110), laterally to second lateral perimetric edges (106) of said first element (103). 12. Innerboot according to claim 11, characterized in that said fourth element (109) is frontally provided with a seat (117) for an insert (118) at its lateral surface (116). 13. Innerboot according to claim 12, characterized in that it comprises a third element (108), such as a tongue, surrounding the user's leg to the rear and the lower end of 



which can be arranged laterally with respect to said second lateral perimetric edges (106) of said first element (103).
