<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet apparatus offers enhanced print quality 
and is highly conducive to mass-production. The apparatus 

has a piezoelectric ceramic arrangement including a 
plurality of ink channels filled with ink. The ink 

channels are defined by walls and correspond to nozzles. 
The walls are deformed selectively by a piezoelectric 

effect to vary the volumes of the selected ink channels to 
jet out the ink through the corresponding nozzles. The 

center position of each of the nozzles is allowed to 
deviate from the middle between one wall of the 

corresponding ink channel and the other wall opposite 
thereto by half the distance between the two walls minus 

half the diameter of the nozzle within the half distance. 
This arrangement reduces the number of defective ink jet 

printer heads in the manufacturing phase and allows the 
ink jet apparatus to offer enhanced print quality. Such 

an apparatus is also highly conducive to mass-production 
with no need for specialized adjustments of individual 

nozzles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet apparatus
having a piezoelectric ceramic arrangement comprising ink
channels separated by walls and filled with ink. The walls
of the ink channels are selectively deformed by the
piezoelectric effect to vary the volumes of the channels so
that the ink therein will be jetted out through the nozzles
corresponding to those channels.The above type of ink jet apparatus has been
conventionally used in ink jet printers such as described
in EP-A-0364136 and EP-A-0513971, upon which the
precharacterising portion of appended claim 1 is based. A
first example of a typical prior art ink jet apparatus is
outlined below with reference to Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, each
ink chamber 70 is formed by a housing 72 including side
walls 74 equipped with piezoelectric ceramic devices 76.
Electrodes 77 are furnished on both sides of each
piezoelectric ceramic device 76 and are connected to a
driving circuit 79.When the driving circuit 79 applies a driving
voltage to the electrodes 77, the piezoelectric ceramic
device 76 attached thereto is deformed accordingly. With
the piezoelectric ceramic device 76 deformed, the side
wall 74 is deformed into a shape indicated by the dashed
line in Fig. 6, thereby reducing the volume of the ink
chamber 70. The reduction in the volume of the ink
chamber 70 causes the ink therein to jet out as an ink
droplet 80 through a nozzle 82.Thereafter, with the driving voltage removed, the
piezoelectric ceramic device 76 returns to its original
shape and thus increases the volume of the ink chamber 70.
The increase in the volume of the ink chamber 70
introduces additional ink thereinto through an ink conduit
84. Typically, ink jet printers comprise numerous ink
chambers 70 when manufactured.A second example of a typical prior art ink jet
apparatus is outlined below with reference to Fig. 7. In
Fig. 7, an ink jet printer head 1 comprises a 
piezoelectric ceramic plate 2, a cover plate 3, a nozzle
plate 31 and a substrate 41.The piezoelectric ceramic plate 2 has a plurality
of grooves 8. Side walls 11 defining the grooves 8 are
polarized in the direction shown by arrow 5. The grooves
8 are of a uniform depth and are parallel. The grooves 8
become gradually shallower as they approach an edge 15 of
the piezoelectric ceramic plate 2. Near the edge 15, the
grooves 8 merge into shallow grooves 16. Inside the
grooves 8, the upper half of each of the side walls 11 is
covered with a metal electrode 13 formed thereon by
sputtering or by other suitable processes. Inside the
