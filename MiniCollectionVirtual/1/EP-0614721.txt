<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a solder paste composition. 
More particularly, this invention relates to a solder paste 
composition for microelectronic packaging. Soldering is a low temperature means for 
mechanically and electrically joining metal or metallized objects. 
A molten metal alloy, selected for its low melting point, forms 
the joint. In microelectronic packaging, soldering is one of the 
last steps in assembling the package. Discrete components are 
constructed with pins, leads or surface metal pads for mounting. 
The substrate is prepared with complementary receptacles or 
surface metallization to receive the components. Ultimately, the 
components are soldered to the substrate. Conventional eutectic 
and pseudo-eutectic metal alloys and mixtures are used in the 
solder pastes. These pastes have low melting points, usually on 
the order of 100-200째C, allowing the peak soldering 
temperature to be as low as 120-220째C. The low temperatures of soldering render It 
particularly advantageous for microelectronic package 
applications. Thermal stress is minimal on the parts being 
joined, and the integrity of these parts, especially the lower 
melting circuitry patterns therein, is not compromised by the 
subsequent low temperature solder operation.  
 But, soldering joints also have disadvantages. Most 
notably, the solder joint can be damaged during subsequent high 
temperature processing or use in a thermally hostile 
environment, such as under the hood of an automobile. As the 
temperature approaches the melting point of the solder metal, it 
softens and flows. Metal in the solder starts to diffuse 
undesirably into surrounding metallizations. The mechanical 
and electrical connection can be completely ruptured. And, 
when the solder is applied to a metallization on a ceramic 
surface, the solder attacks the metallization-ceramic interface 
causing the metallization to pull away from the ceramic. Endeavoring to overcome the disadvantages of 
conventional solders, modified compositions have been 
proposed. In Metallurgica et Materialia, Vol. 25. pp. 2323-2328, 
1991, Betrabet et al. disclose a pseudo-eutectic solder paste 
additionally containing particles of the intermetallic compound 
Ni3Sn4. Similarly, at the National Electronic Packaging and 
Production Conference (NEPCON) West 92, Anaheim, CA, 1992, 
Clough et al. disclosed a eutectic solder paste reinforced with 
particles of Cu and the intermetallic compound Cu6Sn5. Mixed 
results were reported: Betrabet et al. found the Ni3Sn4 
intermetallic
