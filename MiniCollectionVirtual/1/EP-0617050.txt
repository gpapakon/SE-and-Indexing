<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel process for obtaining a product, preferably a foamed product or a foam material, from non-modified starch. In this process, the non-modified starch is introduced by at least one feed opening into a treatment chamber, in which there is provided at least one conveying device, which transports starch from the feed opening in an axial direction through the treatment chamber, which has an effective cross-section enlarging in the transporting direction, so that a foaming and/or breaking up of the starch is achieved by volume enlargement or expansion. At an end of the treatment chamber remote from the feed opening there is provided at least one outlet opening for extruding the product or material.

Process for manufacturing a foamed product or a foam 
material from non-modified starch, 
characterised in that
 
the non-modified starch is introduced via a feed opening 

(12) into a treatment chamber (5) of an extruder with at 
least one worm (6) rotating therein, which transports the 

starch from the feed opening (12) in an axial direction 
(LA) through the treatment chamber (5) to a discharge 

opening (14, 14'), the (treatment chamber) has an effective 
cross section which increases in the direction of 

conveyance of the worm and is provided with at least one 
thread (11) or one profiling on the wall enclosing the 

worm, so that the non-modified starch is broken up whilst 
being conveyed through the treatment chamber and the starch 

foams due to an increase in its volume, and in that at the 
discharge opening (14, 14') extruded, foamed product is 

subsequently treated with water vapour. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised by the use of 
an extruder in which the diameter of the worm and of the 

treatment chamber increases continuously in the direction 
of transportation. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised by the use of 
an extruder in which the diameter of the worm and of the 

treatment chamber increases in stages. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 3, characterised by 
the use of an extruder in which the effective cross section 

of the treatment chamber increases in the direction of 
transportation over the entire length of the said treatment 

chamber. 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 4, characterised in 
that the extruded and foamed material is chopped up into  

 
pellets or into a granular product or material by a cutting 

device (15). 
Process according to one of claims 1 - 5, characterised in 
that the non-modified starch is maize grits. 
Device to effect the process according to one of claims 1 - 
6, 
characterised
 by at least one treatment chamber (5), by 
at least one feed opening (12) to introduce the non-modified 

starch into the treatment chamber, by at least one 
worm rotating around the longitudinal axis (LA) of the 

treatment chamber (5), which is arranged in the treatment 
chamber in order to transport the starch from the feed 

opening in an axial direction (L) through the treatment 
chamber to a discharge opening (14, 14'), whereby the 

treatment chamber is provided with a thread (10, 11) or a 
profiling on one of the walls adjacent to the at least one 

worm (6) and exhibits an effective cross section which 
increases in the direction of transportation, so that the 

starch is broken up during transportation through the 
treatment chamber and expands due to an increase in volume, 

and by a subsequent treatment device (20), using which the 
product or material extruded and foamed from the discharge 

opening (14, 14') is treated with water vapour. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
treatment chamber (5) and the worm (6) are designed in at 

least a partial area in such a way that the diameter 
continuously increases. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the 
treatment chamber (5) and the worm (6) are designed in at 

least a partial area of the treatment chamber in such a way 
that their diameter increases in stages. 
Device according to one of claims 7 - 9, characterised in 
that the effective cross section of the treatment chamber 

increases over the entire length of the said treatment 
chamber.  

 
Device according to one of claims 7 - 11, characterised by 
a cutting device (15), with which the extruded and foamed 

product or material is chopped into pellets or into a 
granular product or material.
