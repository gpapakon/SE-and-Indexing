<DESCRIPTION>
 EXTERNALLY UPDATABLE ROM (EUROM)DESCRIPTIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to electronically programmable read-only memories, and more particularly to memory with an embedded controller that allows the memory contents to be changed independently of, but without removal from, a system of which it is a component part.Description of the Prior ArtMicroprocessor-based systems and subsystems commonly employ a read-only memory (ROM) to store at least certain operating system routines. Within the last several years, new electronically programmable read-only memories (EPROMs) have been developed and are in commercial use. These memories include various device technologies. Most applications are simply a non-volatile memory such as EEPROM, Flash, SRAM with battery backup or FRAM.These new memory technologies offer a potential for in-sys em changes in the program stored in them. However, this potential has not been fully commercially realized because of the system overhead needed to take advantage of this potential. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAn object of this invention is the provision of an electronically programmable, memory module that has an embedded controller to allow the contents of the memory to be altered independently of the system of which the module is a part and without removing the module from a system.Briefly, the invention contemplates the provision of an electronically programmable read¬ only memory module with an embedded micro-controller (i.e., controller, processor, or control logic) for program/data updating.Upon power up, the module acts as a prior art ROM. The embedded micro-controller in a standby mode is responsive to data arriving from a download communication interface that is accessible by an external port on the module. The external port and download communication interface is independent of the system of which the module is an operating component. When a command is received from the download communication interface, the micro¬ controller switches the memory device to respond to micro-controller inputs that starts an update session. The micro-controller receives download data from the download communication interface and writes it into the memory device. When the download process terminates, the micro-controller switches the memory device back to its system interface. The memory device can be any standard memory component. Practically it should be non-volatile memory such as EEPROM, Flash memory, Static RAM with battery backup.
