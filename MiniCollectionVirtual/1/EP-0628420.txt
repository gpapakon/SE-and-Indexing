<ABSTRACT>
A printer which is provided with printing 
belts (16, 16') having printing types (16b, 16b') 

and display types (16d, 16d'), and setting wheels 
(7, 7') for turning the printing belts. In order 

to prevent the display types from being soiled, 
the movements of the printing belts are restricted, 

and, after the printing belts have reached turning 
restricting positions, the setting wheels are turned 

idly to prevent the printer from being broken. The 
turning restricting positions are determined by a pair 

of projections (16e, 16f; 16e', 16f') provided on the 
printing belts and edges (4a, 5a; 4a', 5a') of display 

window frames (4, 5'; 4', 5'). The idle turning of 
the setting wheels is done owing to the provision of 

inclined surface portions (16h, 16h') on the surfaces 
or recesses, with which the teeth (7b, 7b') of the 

setting wheel are to be engaged, in the printing belts, 
which inclined surface portions inclined upward 

from the portion closer to the projections on the 
printing belts toward the portion more remote from 

the same projections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printer, and more
specifically to a printer which is to be applied to hand labellers
or the like and which comprises: a display window; a plurality of
setting wheels rotatably mounted about a common axis; endless
printing type belts which carry in a region of their length at the
outer surface printing types and in another region of their length
at the outer surface indicating types which are stretched around the
setting wheels and around recesses arranged spaces therefrom and
which are adjustable by turning the setting wheels; setting wheels
having an actuating knob; and stop means for limiting the turning
angle of the setting wheels when the printing belts have reached
adjustable limit positions thereof.Such a printer is described in U. S. Patent No. 4,679,500.
When using the printer, the printing types which are disposed at a
predetermined printing position are inked and then brought into
contact with the medium to be printed. The display or indicating
types are associated in their position with the printing types on
the belts in such a manner that for each printing type which
happens to be disposed in the printing position a corresponding
indicating type is disposed in a display position and is visible to
the operator so that the operator can see which character, symbol or 
numeral can be printed with the printing type at that instant in
the printing position. For reasons of good legibility the
indicating types are generally disposed on a white background. If
the setting wheels could be turned with the aid of the setting shaft
to any desired extent it could easily happen that the indicating
types mistakenly reach the printing position and are inked with
printing ink. It would also be possible for printing ink to get
onto the background of the indicating types so that the characters,
symbols and numerals would then not easily be legible through the
display window.In order to solve this problem, the printer disclosed by the
above-mentioned U. S. Patent No. 4,679,500 uses a stop shoulder
which is formed on printing type receivers and to be engaged with a
front tooth disposed in adjusting directions of the printing belt
as well as a web which is disposed at a location spaced from the
stop shoulder for a distance which is smaller than the height of at
least the tooth lying in front of each adjustment direction of the
printing belt plus the printing belt thickness so that the front
tooth is stopped between the stop shoulder and the web so as to stop
the printing belt at a

<CLAIMS>
A printer comprising:

a display window,
a plurality of setting wheels (7; 7') disposed adjacent to said
display window, mounted rotatably about a common axis and having

teeth (7b; 7b') formed at equal intervals on an outer circumferential
surfaces thereof,
printing type receivers (15, 15') disposed on the side opposite to the
display window with regard to said setting wheels (7; 7') with spaces

reserved from said setting wheels (7; 7'),
endless printing belts (16; 16') having printing types (16b; 16b') arranged on a
region of a longitudinal outer circumferential surface thereof,

indicating types (16d; 16d') arranged on another region of the longitudinal
outer circumferential surface thereof, a plurality of recesses

(16g; 16g')
to

be engaged with the teeth (7b; 7b') of said setting wheels
(7; 7')

formed on a region
of an inner circumferential surface corresponding to said another

region, stretched around said setting wheels (7; 7') and said printing type
receivers (15; 15'), and adjustable by rotating said setting wheels

(7, 7'),
a setting shaft (8; 8') engageable selectively with any one of said
setting wheels (7, 7'), and having an actuating knob (10; 10'), and
stop means
(4a, 5a; 4a', 5a')

for stopping rotations of said printing type
belts (16, 16') when they have reached adjustable limit positions;

   wherein convexities
(16e, 16f; 16e', 16f')

engageable with said stop means
(4a, 5a; 4a', 5a')

are
formed on said printing type belts (16; 16') at locations corresponding to

both end positions of a range within which the printing type belts
(16; 16')

are adjustable by turning said setting wheels (7; 7'), and
 
   wherein said recesses

(16h, 16i; 16h', 16i')
adjacent to the convexities

(16e, 16f; 16e', 16f')
are formed

so as to be slant or rise from positions near the convexities
(16e, 16f; 16e', 16f')

to other
positions further away from the convexities

(16e, 16f; 16e', 16f') such that the teeth (7b; 7b') of the
setting wheels (7; 7') will engage the slanted recesses (16h,

16i; 16h', 16i') when the convexities (16e, 16f; 16e', 16f')
engage the stop means (4a, 5a; 4a', 5a').
A printer according to Claim 1 wherein said stop means (4a, 5a; 4a', 5a')
are formed as portions of frame members

(4, 5; 4', 5')
of said display window.
A printer according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein no printing
types

(16b, 16b')
nor indicating types

(16d, 16d')
are arranged on regions of the outer

circumferential surfaces of said printing type belts (16; 16') adjacent to
said convexities (16e, 16f; 16e', 16f').
