<ABSTRACT>
Levelling material for use as levelling layer for uneven substrates composed by a coarse levelling layer and a loading layer. The coarse levelling layer is at least 10 mm thick and consists of a pumpable coarse levelling compound with a binder content of 4-14 % of the dry weight, water-binder ratio of 1-5 and a content of sand plus filler of 85-95 % of the dry weight. The compressive strength is 2-17 MPa. The loading layer is of such a type that it rests with all of its bottom surface evenly distributed over the top surface of the coarse levelling layer and has an even thickness. In a preferred version, the loading layer is a fine levelling layer. This fine levelling layer has a thickness of 2-15 mm and consists of a pumpable fine levelling compound with a shrinkage of at most 0.15 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a screed material or levelling compound of the kind that is 
described in the preamble of the claim and that is to be used in the production of so called 
levelling layers, which are intended to level uneven substrates, e.g. concrete constructions, with 
the purpose of achieving a surface which is smooth and even enough to serve as a floor surface. Since a long time levelling of e.g. concrete constructions have been done by casting onto the load 
bearing concrete structure a relatively thick layer of a cement mortar. This early solution of the 
problem however has considerable disadvantages, among which it can be mentioned that the 
method is very time consuming and labour intensive. Another technique that has been used to make the concrete substrate smooth and even enough to 
fulfill the requirements of the later floor coverings, has been that one has tried to make the 
concrete itself even enough, e.g. by vibration casting, power floating etc, but this technique has 
not functioned well in practice, because it is costly and time consuming. Today, levelling of uneven substrates preferably is done by using pumpable levelling compounds. 
However, when the demand of levelling is great because the unevenness exceeds 10-20 mm, 
which often is the case for prefabricated concrete elements, the high consumption of material leads 
to too high costs when you want to meet the requirements for loading capacity which normally are 
asked for. A common requirement in local codes of practice, e.g. the Swedish Hus AMA 83, is that the 
levelling compound shall have an adhesion of at least 0.5 MPa measured after loading with a 
rolling office chair castor according to the Swedish Standard SS 92 35 07. The loading capacity of 
a product is determined by the content of polymer and the content of binder. These two 
ingredients constitute the major part of the production cost. The present invention has the aim to achieve a new levelling material of the decribed kind and 
with considerably lower costs than with traditional techniques for the production of levelling 
layers on uneven substrates, where the unevenness is great, e.g. exceeds 10-20 mm. This is of 
utmost importance, since the development trend goes towards thicker levelling layers because of 
increased requirements on sound insulation and also because of demands for placing installations 
in the floor screed.  
 This aim is achieved by the invention with a levelling material of the described kind and which is 
characterized by the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Levelling material for levelling uneven substrates, which material is applied on the substrate 
in at least two layers, one coarse levelling layer of at least 10 mm thickness made of a 

pumpable coarse levelling compound and on this a loading layer

that the coarse levelling layer consists of a pumpable coarse levelling compound having a 

binder content of 4-14 %, preferably 5-10 % of the dry weight of the compound, a water-binder 
ratio of 1-5, preferably 1.5-4, and a content of sand and filler of 85-95 %, preferably 

89-94 % by weight, that the coarse levelling layer of said composition is adjusted to have a 
compressive strength after 28 days hardening of 2-17 MPa, preferably 3-8 MPa and a 

resistance against wheel loading which is at the most 0.4 MPa when measured according to 
the Swedish Standard SS 923507 or similar local standard while the loading layer is of such a

Swedish Standard SS923507 or similar local standard.

characterized in
 that the loading 
layer is made of a pumpable, preferably self smoothing, fine levelling compound with a
