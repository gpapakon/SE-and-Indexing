<DESCRIPTION>
Clinical isolates of staphylococci 
(Staphylococcus aureus and S.epidermidis) which cause 
serious infections due to their intrinsic resistance to 
beta-lactamase-stable beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., 
methicillin) carry the mecA gene. Song et al., FEBS Lett.221:167-171 (1987). This gene encodes a putative cell wall 
biosynthetic enzyme referred to as penicillin binding 
protein 2a (PBP2a). PBP2a, which binds beta-lactams only 
at concentrations well above therapeutic efficacy, 
apparently can functionally substitute for all the 
staphylococcal PBPs and permit growth when the host 
organism is threatened by beta-lactams. Hartman and 
Tomasz, J. Bacteriol.158:513-516 (1984). Wu et al., 
Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.36:533-539 (1992) and Ryffel 
et al., Gene94:137-138 (1990). The mecA gene is not a normal part of the 
staphylococcal genome. The organism which donated mecA to 
the staphylococci remains unidentified. Despite the 
uniform presence of mecA in methicillin-resistant clinical 
isolates, these isolates vary considerably in their degree 
of resistance to methicillin. This variation in phenotypic 
expression within a population has been referred to as 
heterogenous expression. Matthews and Stewart, FEMS 
Microbiol. Lett.22:161-166 (1984). Typically, most cells 
exhibit low-level resistance to methicillin and only a 
minority of the population express high-level resistance, 
perhaps only one in 10⁸ cells. Tomasz et al., Antimicrob. 
Agents Chemother.35:124-129 (1991). Although expression 
of methicillin resistance is dependent upon the presence of 
PBP2a, it appears to be somewhat independent of the amount 
of PBP2a, suggesting important roles for other factors. 
Chambers and Hackbarth, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.31:1982-1988 (1987) and Murakami and Tomasz, J. Bacteriol.171:874-879 (1989). Tn551 insertional mutagenesis of methicillin-resistant 
S. aureus revealed numerous sites which influence 
the level of methicillin resistance but are not linked to 
mecA and do not perturb the expression of PBP2a. Berger-Bächi 
et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.36:1367-1373 
(1992); Kornblum et al., Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol.5:714-718 
(1986); Berger-Bachi et al., Mol. Gen. Genet.219:263-269 
(1989) and Maidhof et al., J. Bacteriol.173:3507-3513 
(1991). Those factors described thus far generally depress 
the MIC of beta-lactam resistant strains. Some of the 
genetic loci which demonstrate such an effect on 
methicillin resistance were designated factors essential 
for methicillin resistance (fem).
