<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oxidative coupling of 
methane on octahedral molecular sieves, mainly manganese 
oxides, equivalent to the structures of natural minerals, 
e.g., todorokite and hollandite. Hollandite (BaMn₈O₁₆), cryptomelane (KMn₈O₁₆), 
manjiroite (NaMn₈O₁₆), and coronadite (PbMn₈O₁₆) are all 
naturally occurring manganese minerals with a 3-dimensional 
framework tunnel structure. The structure 
consists of MnO₆ octahedra which share edges to form double 
chains, and the octahedra of the double chains share 
corners with adjacent double chains to form a 2x2 tunnel 
structure. The size of these tunnels is 4.6 Å x 4.6 Å. 
Ba, K, Na and Pb ions are present in the tunnels and 
coordinated to the oxygens of the double chains. The 
identity of the tunnel cations determines the mineral 
species. The minerals are members of the hollandite-romanechite 
family which has a common double chain width, 
T(2x2). Zeolites and zeolite-like materials are well-known 
molecular sieves. These materials use tetrahedral 
coordinated species T0₄, (T=Si, Al, P, B, Be, Ga, etc.,) as 
the basic structure unit. Through the secondary building 
units (SBU), a variety of frameworks with different pore 
structures are then built. Like tetrahedra, octahedra 
also can be used as the basic structural unit to form 
octahedral molecular sieves (OMS).  The hollandites are representative of a family of 
hydrous manganese oxides with tunnel structures (also 
described as "framework hydrates") in which Mn can be 
present as Mn⁺⁴ and other oxidation states. The tunnels 
vary in size and configuration, and various mono- or 
divalent cations may be present in the tunnels. Such 
cations may serve to form and support the tunnels in some 
cases. Clearfield describes various hydrous manganese 
oxides with tunnel structures in "Role of Ion Exchange in 
Solid-State Chemistry," Chemical Reviews, Vol. 88, pp. 
125-131 (1988). Pyrolusite or β-MnO₂ has tunnels only one 
MnO₆ octahedron square (1x1), or about 2.3 Å square, while 
in ramsdellite, MnO₂, these octahedra form (2x1) tunnels, 
about 2.73 Å x 4.6 Å. Nsutite, γ-MnO2, is described as an 
intergrowth of pyrolusite and ramsdelite and also has 
(2x1) tunnels. Psilomelane, Ba₂Mn₅O₁₀xH₂O, and romanechite 
(with K⁺² substituted for Ba⁺² in the psilomelane formula) 
have (3x2) tunnels parallel to the cell b axes, about 4.6 
Å x 6.9 Å. Todorokites, (Na,Ca,Mn) Mn₃O₇xH₂O, have (3x3) 
tunnels, about 6.9 Å square, and monoclinic cells. 
Todorokites and other species are described by Turner et 
al.
