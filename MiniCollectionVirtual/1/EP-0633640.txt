<ABSTRACT>
An earth leakage unit 10 includes a core 12. 
Two load current-carrying wires 14, 16 pass through the 

core 12. A primary coil 44 is carried on the core 12 
for sensing an imbalance in the wires 14, 16. An 

auxiliary coil 18 is wound on the core 12. A pair of 
back-to-back zener diodes 20 is connected in series with 

the coil 18 to supply current to the coil 18 when an 
applied voltage exceeds a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an earth leakage unit.The invention provides an earth leakage unit as claimed in claim 1, to which reference is
directed. An earth leakage unit having the features contained in the
preamble of claim 1 is known from the British patent application GB-A-2 244 398. It will be appreciated that, with a single
phase system, in use, a live and neutral wire pass
through the core. The auxiliary coil and current supply
means may then be connected between the neutral supply
cable and an earth of an electrical system with which
the earth leakage unit is used, between the live supply
cable and the earth, or between the live and neutral 
supply cables. It will be appreciated that, if the
auxiliary coil is connected between the neutral and
earth the unit will trip if the voltage on the neutral
line rises above a predetermined value, as can occur if
the neutral voltage to earth exceeds a predetermined
value, or if the neutral line is lost altogether.
Similarly, if the auxiliary coil is connected between
the live line and either the earth or neutral line, the
unit will provide over-voltage protection.It will be appreciated further by those
skilled in the art that earth leakage units usually also
have a test coil wound on the core by means of which the
earth leakage unit may be tested. Conveniently, the
auxiliary coil may also be used for this purpose. Thus,
the auxiliary coil may also be connected to a DC voltage
supply (which may pulsate) via a test button. The test
button may be in parallel with the current supply means.The current supply means may conveniently
comprise a pair of back-to-back zener diodes in series
with a current limiting resistor.Further, the earth leakage unit may have a DC
supply means for supplying DC power to electronic
components of the unit, the DC supply means being
connected across the live and neutral wires. The invention is now described, by way of examples, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a portion of an earth leakage unitFigure 2 is a schematic circuit diagram of an earth leakage unit in accordance
with the invention;Figure 3 is a schematic circuit diagram of a portion of an earth leakage unit andFigure 4 is a schematic circuit diagram of another earth leakage unit in
accordance with the invention.Referring to Figure 1, an earth leakage unit
is indicated generally
by reference numeral 10. It must be appreciated that
Figure 1 does not show all the components of the earth
leakage unit.As with
