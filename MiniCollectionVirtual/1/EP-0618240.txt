<ABSTRACT>
A process for efficiently utilizing hypophosphorous acid or salts thereof as a chain 
transfer agent is provided wherein the polymerization is conducted to a final polymer solids 

level of at least about 50 percent by weight. 
The polymers produced are useful as dispersants for paint formulations, additives for 
laundry and machine dishwashing detergents, mineral dispersants, dispersants for kaolin 

clay slurries and scale inhibitors, dispersants and corrosion inhibitors for water treatment 
and oil production.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for efficient utilization of chain transfer agent. In
particular, this invention relates to a process for the efficient use of hypophosphorous acid as
a chain transfer agent in aqueous polymerizations.Low molecular weight polycarboxylic acid polymers and their salts are useful as
dispersants, scale inhibitors, detergent additives, sequestrants, etc. Generally a molecular
weight below 50,000 is necessary for effective performance and often very low molecular
weights below 10,000 are most effective. It is common to use chain transfer agents in the
polymerization reaction to produce low, and especially the very low, molecular weight
polymers. Hypophosphorus acid or its salts (commonly sodium hypophosphite) are a
particularly desirable chain transfer agent, chosen primarily because they introduce
phosphinate and phosphonate functionality into water soluble polymer molecules which
confers superior performance properties in some applications. As used hereinafter and in
the appended claims the term "hypophosphorous acid" is intended to include salts thereof,
unless a clearly different meaning is indicated.Inefficiency is a problem that is common to most of the known processes utilizing
hypophosphorous acid as a chain transfer agent. Much of the agent does not specifically
become part of the transfer process. A significant portion is not incorporated into the
polymer and remains unreacted or is converted to other inorganic species like phosphorous
acid or its salts. As a consequence, high levels of hypophosphorous acid are required to
obtain low molecular weight. Since hypophosphorous acid is a relatively expensive
material, it becomes a costly route to low molecular weight polymers if it is not used
efficiently. In the case of preparing very low molecular weight polymers, the levels of
hypophosphorous acid required may be prohibitively expensive if the hypophosphorous acid
is not used efficiently.A second disadvantage arising from the inefficiency of the process is the significant
amounts of unreacted hypophosphite or other inorganic residues present in the reaction
product. These salts do not contribute to performance thereby diluting the activity of the
reaction product. In some cases, such as preparing concentrated clay slurries, these salts can
interfere with the dispersing process.One method of increasing the efficiency of hypophosphorous acid as a chain transfer
agent is disclosed in US 5,077,361 to Hughes, et al. The method disclosed by Hughes, et al.
