<ABSTRACT>
A hand plane has a rotating planing tool (7), behind which an exit table plate (12) is arranged and in front of which an entry table plate (13) adjustable in the vertical direction (15) by means of a turning handle (23) is arranged. Located between the turning handle (23) and the entry table plate (13) is a threaded drive (26) which has a drive part (27) which turns with the turning handle (23), and an adjusting part (28) which is in threaded engagement with said drive part, is connected to the entry table plate (13), is non-rotatably mounted and during the turning of the drive part (27) performs a linear movement in the axial direction (29) of the threaded drive (26). The turning handle is arranged facing forwards on the machine casing (2), so that the axial direction (29) of the threaded drive (26) is at an angle to the vertical direction (15). The adjusting part (28) carries at its rear end an adjusting member (33) which is connected to the entry table plate (13) and transmits the adjusting movement to the entry table plate (13).

<CLAIMS>
Hand-operated planer with a rotating planing tool (7), a 
discharge platen (11) fitted behind the planing tool (7) at a 

tangent to its circular path, a feed platen (13) ahead of the 
planing tool (7) and a turning handle (23) located outside the 

machine housing (2) to generate, guided on the machine housing 
(2), an adjusting movement in the vertical direction of the feed 

platen (13) essentially at right angles to its bearing surface 
(14) for placing on a workpiece, wherein arranged between the 

turning handle (23) and the feed platen (13) is a threaded drive 
which has a drive element (27) which follows the rotary movement 

of the turning handle (23) and an adjusting section (28) in 
threaded engagement with the drive element, connected to the feed 

platen (13), unrotatably mounted and executing a linear movement 
in the axial direction (29) of the threaded drive when the drive 

element (27) rotates, characterized in that the turning handle 
(23) is mounted facing forwards on the machine housing (2) so 

that the axial direction (29) of the threaded drive (26) runs at 
an obtuse-angle to the vertical direction (15), sloping from top 

front to bottom rear, and that the adjusting section (28) 
supports, on that part of it facing away from the turning handle 

(23), behind its threaded section (32) in threaded engagement 
with the drive element (27), an adjusting element (33) connected 

to the feed platen (13) which converts the movement of the 
adjusting section (28) into the adjusting movement of the feed 

platen (13), with a slide surface (34) which in side view is 
mounted at an angle to the axial direction (29) of the threaded 

drive, which rests on a mating slide surface (35) connected to 
the feed platen (13) and is held against the mating slide surface 

(35) by means of a retaining device (36) which permits sliding 
of the slide surface (34) on the mating slide surface (35) in 

such a way that, when the turning handle (23) is turned in the 
axial direction (29) of the threaded drive, the adjusting element 

(34) moves and, displacing the feed platen (13), shifts 
vertically on to or away from the mating slide surface (35).  

 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the slide surface is essentially at right-angles to the 

vertical direction (15). 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the retaining device (36) contains a retaining element 

(38) which engages through a longitudinal slot (37) in the 
adjusting element (33), while being at one end connected firmly 

to the feed platen (13) and at the other end engaging from the 
rear via a head section (39) with the adjusting element (33). 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the retaining element (38) is a threaded pin in screwed 

connection with the feed platen (13). 
Hand-operated planer according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the mating slide surface (35) is spring-mounted 

against the slide surface (34). 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that a spring (41), in particular a disc-like spring, is 

mounted between the retaining element (38) and the adjusting 
element (33). 
Hand-operated planer according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that, attached to the central area of the feed 

platen (13) and extending vertically from it, is a guide 
extension (19) guided on the machine housing (2), the end face 

of which forms the mating slide surface (35). 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 7, in so far as claim 
7 depends on claim 4, characterized in that the threaded pin (38) 

of the retaining device which engages through the longitudinal 
slot (37) of the adjusting element (35), is screwed into the 

guide extension (19).  
 
Hand-operated planer according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the adjusting element (33) is moulded 

integrally on to the adjusting section (28). 
Hand-operated planer according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the adjusting element (33) has a U-shaped 

cross-section, with a transverse web (43) of the adjusting 
element forming the slide surface (34) and the two adjusting 

element legs (44) extending upwards from the transverse web (43) 
guided on a machine housing (2). 
Hand-operated planer according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the adjusting section (28), expediently on 

the adjusting element (33), has a stop (45) limiting its linear 
movement in the axial direction (29) of the threaded drive (26), 

to which is assigned a counter-stop (46) on the machine housing 
side. 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 11, characterized 
in that, to increase the adjustment path, the counter-stop (46) 

can be moved out of the movement path of the stop (45). 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 12, characterized 
in that the counter-stop (46) is mounted on a slide (47) or the 

like guided on the machine housing (2).
