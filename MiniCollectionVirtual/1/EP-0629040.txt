<ABSTRACT>
Usual A/D converters are not suited for digitising video IF signals because video 
signals have a much higher bandwidth and because video signals are vestigal-sideband 

modulated.
 

The inventive analogue-to-digital conversion circumvents the low dynamic resolution 
problem of the ADC and allows the application of low-cost ADCs. The problem 

of low dynamic range with IF digitising can be overcome by combining the 
basic super-heterodyne principle and the digitising of an in-phase and a quadrature 

component of a zero-IF and by using a reduced sampling clock for the ADCs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to an apparatus 
for IF demodulation of a high frequency input signal. The use of digital signal processing in modern TV receiver 
design should allow to perform many of signal conditioning, filtering 
and demodulation functions in a more flexible and economical 
way as it is the case today with analogue components, 
thus, conferring an improved performance.
 
The digital processing starts with an A/D conversion, if possible, 
it should include the IF processing. The digitising of 
audio IF signals is known from "Undersampling Techniques Simplifying 
Digital Radio", Electronics Design 67, May 23, 1991.
 
But such techniques are not suitable for video IF signals for 
two reasons: 
video signals have a much higher bandwidth, video signals are vestigal-sideband modulated (VSB). It is one object of the invention to disclose a method of digitising 
video IF signals using existing A/D converters. This 
object is reached by the method disclosed in claim 1. It is a further object of the invention to disclose an apparatus 
which utilises the inventive method. This object is reached by 
the apparatus disclosed in claim 9. At present, the ADC technology can be considered as a principal 
constraint to the advancement of digitally implemented concepts 
in the IF part of an TV receiver. Although this area of technology 
is undergoing a rapid development it cannot be expected that  
 
in the next years low-cost ADCs will come on the market which 
can meet the requirements for such digital TV processing. The 
inventive analogue-to-digital conversion architecture circumvents 
the ADC problems and allows the application of low-cost 
ADCs. The invention allows digitising of VSB modulated IF signals 
of high bandwidth, e.g. TV signals.
 
The potential achievements of a subsequent digital processing 
may be summarised as: 
a reduction in the complexity of analogue elements of the design; the ability to re-configure a TV receiver or VCR, without any 
increase in hardware, to a variety of different TV standards; the ability to provide a range of tailored filter functions 
(f.i. sound trap); the ability to apply on-line correction algorithms (AGC, AFC, 
etc.); the application of novel demodulation techniques.  
The choice of a suitable digital-signal-processing-based TV receiver 
architecture is partly determined by the performance of 
the currently available low-cost analogue-to-digital converters 
(ADC). The dynamic range and the sampling rate of the available 
ADCs play an
