<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorinated aromatic 
compounds, their intermediates, methods of use in treating 
diseases associated with deficiencies of cholinergic transmission 
in the central nervous system and methods for their 
preparation. Compounds of the present invention have the following 
Formula I 
stereoisomers and pharmaceutically acceptable thereof, 
wherein
 
each of Z and Z' are independently H or F;
 
Q is 
CH(OH), 
X is H, Br, Cl, F or CF₃;
 
 
Y is H, Br, Cl, F, OH, OR₅, OC(O)R₄, N₃, CN, NO₂, SO₃H, 
CO₂R₄, NH₂, NHR₉, NR₉R'₉, C(R₆)(R₇)(V'R₈) or C(O)R₇, provided 
that when both Z and Z' are F, then Y is H or F;
 
V and V' are each independently CH₂ or O;
 
R₁ is H or CH₃;
 
R₂, R₉ and R'₉ are each independently (C₁₋₆)alkyl, or R₂ and 
V-R₃ taken together with the carbon atom to which they are 
attached form a 3-6 membered ring;
 
R₃, R₆, R₇ and R₈ are each independently H, (C₁₋₆)alkyl, or 
(C₃₋₆)cycloalkyl;
 
R₄ is H, (C₁₋₁₀)alkyl, (C₀₋₄)alkylene aryl or 
(C₃₋₈)cycloalkyl; and
 
R₅ is (C₁₋₁₀)alkyl, benzyl, phenethyl or (C₃₋₆)cycloalkyl. The compounds of the present invention are used to 
treat patients having conditions responsive to the acetyl-cholinesterase-inhibiting 
properties of the present 
compounds such as in the treatment of Degenerative 
Dementias. The terms "(C₁₋₆)alkyl" and "(C₁₋₁₀)alkyl" mean straight 
or branched chain alkyl radicals containing respectively 
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 
including, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, 
iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl,t-butyl, 
n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, 
2,2-dimethylpropyl, n-hexyl and so on. Likewise, the term 
"(C₀₋₄)alkylene aryl" can mean straight or branched chain 
alkylene groups up to 4 carbon atoms such as ethylethylene,  
 
2-methyltrimethylene, and so on. C₀ of course means no 
alkylene moiety attached to the aryl. "Hydroxy(C₁₋₆) alkyl" means a (C₁₋₆) alkyl group having 
from 1 to 3 hydroxy substituents thereon. Preferably, there 
is only one hydroxy substituent at the alpha position 
(attached to the carbon atom which is directly attached to 
the phenyl). "Ts" or "tosyl" means 
Tosyl derivatives 
mean 
wherein R is C₁₋₆ alkyl. "Aryl" includes both carbocyclic and heterocyclic 
moieties of which phenyl, pyridyl, indolyl, indazolyl, 
furyl and thienyl are of primary interest; these moieties 
being inclusive of their position isomers such as, for 
example, 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl, 2- or 3-furyl and thienyl, 
1-, 2-, or 3-indolyl or the 1- and
