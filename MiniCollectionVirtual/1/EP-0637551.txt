<ABSTRACT>
This is an electronic system which would detect when secured material 
has been unsecured. The system can comprises: a power source 20 

connected to an audio/visual processor 26; an indicator[s] 20,22 also 

connected to the audio/visual processor; a vacuum sensing system 32 also 
connected to the audio/visual processor; and a memory device which would 

trigger only once after the device has been armed, whereby the system would 
be armed after a vacuum has been formed and the stress sensing system 

would detect a leak in the vacuum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to insuring tamper resistance in 
secured materials. Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is 
described in connection with insuring tamper resistance after a product has 
been secured. Tamper resistant products are becoming increasing more important to 
society. With the associated dangers of unauthorized tampering of secured 
materials, the issue of a tamper resistance system is very important. Because of the inherent risks associated with medical products that 
have been tampered with, there has been great strides to insure tamper 
resistance of the packages. The current technology places a seal around the 
usual opening of the package, and if the seal is broken when the consumer 
gets the product, the product has supposedly been tampered with. The seal solution does not address the possibility of the injection of a 
foreign substance through the sides of the package. For example, if the 
product was a bottle of aspirin, cold tablets, cough syrup, etc., then a needle 
with a foreign substance could be injected into the side of the bottle, and the 
seal would never be broken. Since the hole in the side of the bottle would be  
 
small (and probably not easily detected), and the seal on the opening of the 
bottle would be intact, the consumer would assume the bottle has not been 
tampered with. A needle puncture in the seal over the opening would also be 
virtually undetectable. The issue of tamper resistance is not exclusive to medical products. 
Many more products exist where security or tamper resistance is necessary. 
Another example of an area that might require security or tamper resistance 
is the delivery of mail or other material. The delivery of secured materials 
from one place to another may require some tamper detection. Another area 
that might require some type of tamper resistance, is software. With the 
mass destruction that software viruses can perform, the issue of software 
integrity is growing at a very rapid rate. Accordingly, improvements which overcome any or all of the problems 
are presently desirable. It is herein recognized that a need exists for a system that would 
indicate when an object has been tampered with. The present invention is 
directed towards meeting those needs. Generally, and in one form of the invention, a microchip or similar 
device would control access to the secured material. The sensor or triggering 
device would be, for example, vacuum controlled. The sensor would be 
triggered only one time, for

<CLAIMS>
A tamper indicating system comprising: 

a) a power source connected to an audio/visual processor; 
b) an indicator also connected to said audio/visual processor; 
c) a triggable sensing system also connected to said audio/visual 
processor; and arranged such that said indicator is activated on 

only the first triggering of said sensing system. 
A tamper indicating system as claimed in claim 1 and wherein said 
sensing system is a vacuum sensing system whereby said system 

would be armed after a vacuum has been formed and would detect a 
leak in said vacuum and thus trigger only once after the device has 

been armed. 
The system of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said power source is a 
battery or a storage capacitor. 
The system of claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3 wherein said power source is 

drained by powering the indicator after the triggering of the electronic 
system. 
The system of any preceding claim, wherein said indicator comprises a 
LED. 
The system of claim 5, wherein said LED would permanently change 
color when used. 
The system of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein said indicator comprises a 
speaker. 
The system of claim 7, wherein said speaker is a piezo-electric horn 
which serves as an audio indicator. 
Ths system of any preceding claim, wherein the sensing system 
includes a stress sensor. 
The system of claim 9, wherein said stress sensor is a piezo-electric 
sensor. 
The system of any preceding claim including a memory. 
The structure of claim 11, wherein said memory device is a flip-flop 
device. 
The structure of any preceding claim, wherein an event counter is 
connected to said audio/visual processor to insure that the processor 

operates only one time. 
A method of detecting tampering with a secured material comprising: 
a) applying a vacuum to a chamber and arming an audio/visual 
processor by said applying of said vacuum; 
b) sensing a disturbance in said vacuum; 
c) turning on an indicator connected to said audio/visual processor 
after sensing a change in pressure by said vacuum sensing 

system; and 
d) draining a power source connected to said indicator on the first 
disturbance of said vacuum.
