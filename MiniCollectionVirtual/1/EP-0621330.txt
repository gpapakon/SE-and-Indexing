<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical domain of oil, water and 
geothermal wells or the like and the corresponding operations as well. The present invention applies to the drilling fluids, the fracturing fluids, 
the spacers, the diverting fluids the gravel-packing fluids and generally all 
simular fluids and all the operations using these fluids. These operations have been very well known in the art, as well as in 
their principle that in their performance ; the great difficulties of their 
performance have been also well known. Thus, these data would be really uselessly recalled here. That is why 
only the essential will be briefly mentioned below. The drilling fluids, in particular the drilling muds, are well known. These 
are generally loaded fluids that have to present very precise characteristics. Further to the generally searched properties of physio-chemical 
compatibility with the drilled formations, these fluids have to present very 
precise characteristics, principally towards density, rheology, lubricating 
properties and fluid loss, without jeopardizing the rate of penetration. Density plays an esentiel hydrostatic function towards the drilling safety, 
in order to prevent the hole invasion by the formation fluids which could lead 
to the catastrophic blow-out or, on the other hand, fracture the drilled 
formations and lead to a fluid loss putting also at stake the well controlling. Density has also an influence on the stability of the opened hole, the 
weight of the mud column contributing to balance the lithostatic pressure 
exerted on the function. 
The rheologic characteristics must reach to a compromise between a 
minimal charge loss ans a good ability to raise up the rubble due to the drilling 
throughout the annulus space, as far as the ground. Generally, it is searched to minimize the fluid loss due to fluid exposure 
to porous formations, in order not to jeopardize neither the safety of the 
operation nor its economic viability. A special care is given during the 
payzone drilling, in order to minimize the damaging due to the fluid invasion 
that requires to resort to curative treatments. It will be easily understood that the design of a drilling mud that fits to a 
particular situation, results from a subtile compromise between sometimes 
contractictory aims. As an example, it is usually admitted by those skilled in 
the art, that the aforementionned searched properties relative to fluids loss, 
are harmful to the rate penetration, especially for roller-bits. It is also

<CLAIMS>
1 - A Fluid for oil, oilfield, geothermal industry and the like, characterized 
in that : 


a) it comprises in addition to the basic fluid, at least three particulate additives 
whose size distribution, for each additive, is "disjointed" in relation to the other 

additives, at least one of these size ranges being "fine", 
and b) the relative proportions of the particulate additives are chosen in order 
to work at the PVF max of the considered combination of particulate additives, 

or as close as possible to the PVF max, ( PVF being the Packing Volume 
Fraction), 
and c) the proportion of solid matter in relation to water or mixing fluid is 
chosen in order to work above the treshold of solid matter concentration at 

which the so-called "hindered settling" state appears.

some other micro slags (average dimension 0.5-10 µm) and/or 
"very fine" like, for example, a latex or some pigments or some polymer 
microgels like a usual fluid loss control agent (average dimension 0.05-0.5 

µm) and/or 
"ultra fine" like some colloïdal silica or alumina, etc... (average 
dimension 7-50 nm).
