<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compounds. The invention comprises certain 9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid compounds, which are useful 
in the treatment of connective tissue matrix diseases such as 
osteoarthritis, and in the treatment of cancer, said 
compounds being as follows:
 
9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-4,5,8-trimethoxyanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid,
 
4,5-diethoxy-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid,
 
9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-4,5-dipropoxyanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid,
 
4,5-dibutoxy-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid,
 
9,10-dihydro-5,8-dimethoxy-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid,
 
7-acetoxy-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-carboxylic 
acid;
 
and salts and esters thereof.  The compounds can exist in salt form derived from any of the 
well known bases. Preferably such salts are 
pharmaceutically-acceptable, but other salts are included as 
they may serve as intermediates in the purification of 
compounds or in the preparation of other salts, or are useful 
for identification, characterisation or purification.
 
Examples are those derived from ammonium hydroxide and alkali 
and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates and 
bicarbonates, as well as salts derived from aliphatic and 
aromatic amines, aliphatic diamines and hydroxy alkylamines. 
Bases especially useful in the preparation of such salts 
include ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium 
bicarbonate, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, 
methylamine, diethylamine, ethylene diamine, cyclohexylamine 
and ethanolamine. The potassium, sodium and lithium salt 
forms are particularly preferred. The compounds can also be utilised in ester form, esters 
being formed at the 2-carboxy group. These can be any of the 
well known ester groups, both aliphatic and aromatic.
 
Preferred esters are those derived from an alcohol or an 
aminoalcohol, and particularly preferred are alkyl esters 
such as an ester of a C₁₋₄ alcohol, especially the methyl or 
ethyl ester. As mentioned above, the compounds are indicated for use in 
the treatment of osteoarthritis and allied connective tissue 
diseases such as, for example, osteoporosis and rheumatoid  
 
arthritis. Such diseases are often characterised by an 
increase in matrix synthesis and remodelling. Incorporation 
of newly synthesised components into a biological and 
biomechanically functional matrix is, however, frequently 
deficient. Drugs which modulate the activity of the cells 
involved in such connective tissue matrix
