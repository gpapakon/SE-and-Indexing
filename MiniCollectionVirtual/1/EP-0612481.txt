<ABSTRACT>
2.1. For high-performance packaging machines, a correspondingly large stock of cigarettes must be kept ready. A container magazine (11) serves for receiving a multiplicity of containers (11) combined to form storage units (18). Each container receives a relatively large number of cigarettes. Filling takes place via a bottom wall (17). Within the container magazine (11), the storage units (18) can be moved up and down and transversely. 2.2. The containers (12) are also designed in a special way, in order to guarantee fault-free filling and emptying.

machine are arranged in the region between the two part 
magazines (19, 20). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that there leads downwards from the cigarette conveyor 

(41), outside the region of the storage units (18), a 
branch (43), to which is connected in one plane, below 

the lower storage units (18), a transverse track (44) 
which leads to an upwardly directed filling member (40) 

for the cigarettes (10). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that there are two 

separate conveyors, namely a first branch (77) solely for 
filling the containers (12), on the one hand, and a 

second branch (78) solely for emptying the containers 
(12), on the other hand, which are respectively arranged  

 
on opposite sides of the container magazine (11). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the container 

magazine (11) is assigned a transport appliance movable 
on rollers, namely a container carriage (34) having 

vertically adjustable carrying arms (38) which are 
arranged at a distance from one another corresponding to 

the distance between the storage units (18) arranged one 
above the other in the container magazine (11) and which 

each serve for receiving a storage unit (18). 
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the carrying arms (38) are mounted, as overhanging 

arms projecting on one side, on a carrier piece (37) of 
the container carriage (34), the said carrier piece being
