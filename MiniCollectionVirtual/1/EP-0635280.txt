<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for forming an electrode cable, especially a cable for a pacemaker electrode. In order to obtain an arrangement of the type described, which facilitates adaptation of an electrode device to a heart of a patient in an extremely simple and cheap manner it is proposed, according to the invention, that the arrangement (7) be a mainly tubular element (7) which is short in comparison with the length of the electrode cable (2) and whose internal diameter is adapted to the external diameter of the electrode cable (2). The element (7) is designed such that it can be pushed onto the electrode cable (2) and surrounds the electrode cable (2) at least partially, the element (7) showing rigidity such that the electrode cable (2) is formed by the element (7) within the length over which the element (7) is pushed on.

Electrode cable for a heart pacemaker
electrode and an arrangement for shaping the electrode

cable, which arrangement (7) is a mainly tubular
element (7), which is short in comparison with the

length of the electrode cable (2) and the inside
diameter of which is matched to the outside diameter of

the electrode cable (2), characterised in that the
element (7) is constructed in such a way that it can be

slid on to the electrode cable (2) and surrounds the
electrode cable (2) at least partially, the element (7)

having a rigidity which is such that the electrode
cable (2) inside the section of the element (7) which

has been slid on is shaped by the element (7).
Arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that the element (7) is pre-bent and
is flexible in such a way that it and the electrode

cable (2) can be straightened out also in the region of
this section with the aid of a mandrin (10).
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that the element is constructed such
that it is U-shaped or J-shaped.
Arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that the element (7) consists at least
partially of a memory-effect metal of such a type that

the element (7) takes on a desired shape at body
temperature.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the element (7) is constructed in

such a way that it can be shifted on the electrode
cable (2).
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the element (7) is provided with 

a slit (8, 11, 14) over its entire length.
Arrangement according to claim 6,

characterised in that the slit (11) extends at least
partially spirally at the end regions (12) of the

element (7) .
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the element (7) is constructed in

a manner such that it is spiral-shaped.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the element (7) consists of a

silicon material.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to
8, characterised in that the element (7) consists of a

resorbable material.
