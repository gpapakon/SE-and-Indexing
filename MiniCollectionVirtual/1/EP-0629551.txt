<ABSTRACT>
A method for setting pieces (16) of wrapping material, 
in a machine for wrapping articles (14) with 

pieces (16) of wrapping material, during the wrapping 
phase of the article (14) includes transporting 

each single wrapping material piece (16) by means of 
a plurality of support bar means (22a, 23a) which 

are disposed set apart with reference to the 
transport direction, and cooperating with each other 

(24, 25, 26). 
 
An apparatus for carrying about this method includes 
a plurality of closed loop transport means (20, 21), 

at least one wrapping bar (22, 23) associated to 
each one of the above mentioned transport means (20, 

21), driving means (24, 25), designed to drive, in 
proper connection, the transport means (20, 21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has, as a subject, a method
and an apparatus for transporting a piece of wrapping
material during the article wrapping phase in a
machine for wrapping articles with pieces of wrapping
material, particularly heat-shrinkable material.Presently, as described in the patents US-A-3.791.100,
US-A-5.203.144 and US-A-5.203.146, these
last two patents being owned by the applicant of
this patent application, the above mentioned wrapping
machine generally and basically comprises:
a first conveyor, designed for supporting the
articles to be wrapped and to feed them one by one
to a second conveyor;a second wrapping phase conveyor having an inlet
end, an outlet end, and an upper surface situated
between the above mentioned inlet and outlet ends,
this upper surface being aimed at supporting and
conveying articles while being wrap packaged in
succession;means for feeding the wrapping material, designed
to feed single pieces of wrapping material, in
succession, to the above mentioned wrapping phase
conveyor, placing the lead extremity of each wrapping
material piece on top of the upper surface of
the above mentioned wrapping phase conveyor, at the
inlet end thereof;wrapping means comprising an endless conveyor
carrying at least one wrapping bar along a path 
surrounding the above mentioned wrapping phase
conveyor, these wrapping means being designed to set
the above mentioned heat-shrinkable wrapping material
pieces over and in front of each article being
wrapped, then placing the rear extremity of the
above mentioned wrapping material piece in a region
between the above mentioned wrapping phase conveyor
and the upstream end of a third receiving conveyor;a third receiving conveyor, for receiving and
supporting the articles partially wrapped, aimed at
placing the rear extremity of the wrapping material
piece under the lead extremity of the same wrapping
material piece;synchronising means, designed to set in proper
time relation the motion of the above mentioned
first conveyor, the motion of the above mentioned
second conveyor, said means for feeding the wrapping
material, said endless transport means and the
related wrapping bar, and the motion of the above
mentioned third receiving conveyor.These machines, made as explained hitherto, are
affected by several drawbacks as far as the
transport of the wrapping material piece is concerned,
as performed by the wrapping bar endless
transport means.These drawbacks affect negatively the production
rate, as well as the correct and harmonious settlement
of

Method for wrapping an article with a piece of wrapping
material in a wrapping machine comprising:


feeding a piece of wrapping material (16) supplied in single
sequence by conveying means (15) to an upstream end of a

wrapping conveyor (12) such that the leading end of said piece
overlies a receiving upper surface of said wrapping conveyor;
advancing an article (14) to be wrapped onto said receiving
surface onto the leading end of said piece of wrapping material

lying thereon from a feeding conveyor (11) upstream of said
wrapping conveyor, and conveying said article along said

wrapping conveyor (12);
wrapping said article placed on said wrapping conveyor with a
single wrapping material piece by a first wrapping bar (22)

carried by wrapping means (20), during the movement of said bar
(22) along a first path (27) in a vertical plane circumscribing

said wrapping conveyor (12), such that the trailing edge of the
wrapping material piece is brought over the article and below

the upper surface of the wrapping conveyor at its downstream end
so that said piece will come under the moving article at its

discharge;

characterised in that every single wrapping material piece is
transported by means of two wrapping bars (22; 23), both the

first and the second (23) wrapping bar supporting said piece,
and said second bar moving along a second path (28) different

from said first path (27) in a vertical plane circumscribing
said wrapping conveyor (12) a distance spaced behind the first

bar in moving direction, the movements of said wrapping bars
(22, 23) being synchronised such that the trailing edge of the

piece of wrapping material is withdrawn from the upstream end of
the wrapping conveyor (12) by said second wrapping bar. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that said
wrapping bars (22, 23) are displaced along the respective paths

(27, 28) at different speeds.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that said
wrapping bars (22, 23) have a relative distance which increases

upon passage of said bars between said feeding conveyor (11) and
said wrapping conveyor (12) and then decreases again.
Apparatus for wrapping an article (14) with a piece of
wrapping material comprising:


a wrapping conveyor (12), which has an upstream end and a
receiving upper surface, for conveying the article to be wrapped

there along;
conveying means (15) to supply in single sequence a piece of
wrapping material (16) to said upstream end of said wrapping

conveyor (12) such that the leading end of said piece overlies
said receiving upper surface;
a feeding conveyor (11) upstream of said wrapping conveyor
(12) for advancing an article (14) onto said receiving surface

such that said article is moved onto said leading end to be
wrapped;
a first wrapping bar (22) carried by wrapping means (20) for
wrapping said article placed on said wrapping conveyor with a

single wrapping material piece during the movement of said bar
(22) along a first path (27) in a vertical plane circumscribing

said wrapping conveyor (12), such that the trailing end of the

wrapping material piece is brought over the article and below
the upper surface of the wrapping conveyor at its downstream end

so that said piece will come under the moving article at its
discharge;

characterised in that is comprises

a second wrapping bar (23) carried by wrapping means (21),
said first and second wrapping bars together supporting and

transporting every single wrapping material piece, 
a second path (28) in a vertical plane circumscribing said
wrapping conveyor (12) different from said first path (27), said

second wrapping bar capable of being moved along said second
path, a distance spaced behind the first bar (22) in moving

direction,
synchronising means for synchronising the movement of said
wrapping bars (22, 23) such that the trailing edge of the piece

of wrapping material is withdrawn from the upstream end of the
wrapping conveyor (12) by said second wrapping bar.
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that sliding
guides (18, 19) are provided entraining said wrapping bars (22,

23) around respective closed paths (27, 28), said guides (18,
19) guiding said wrapping means, said wrapping means being

chains (20, 21).
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that
said guide means (18, 19) are formed on a pair of uprights (17a,

17b) of a frame (17) straddling said wrapping conveyor (12).
Apparatus according to claim 6 characterised in that said
guide means (18, 19) further comprise a double pair of toothed

wheels (24, 25) keyed to a common shaft (26).
