<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a method of producing a predeterminable current profile for a welding current for feeding a welding apparatus, in particular an AC-TIG or stick-electrode or MIG/MAG welding apparatus. A direct-current voltage is produced from an alternating-current voltage and, by interrupting this direct-current voltage, is converted into a pulsating direct-current voltage, the curve shape of the current profile being variable. The curve shape is established directly from half waves (46, 48) following one another, in particular negative and positive half waves (46, 48), from a number of reference signals (50) forming each half wave (46, 48). The individual reference signals (50) are varied with a desired value corresponding to the maximum amplitude (55, 56) desired of the curve shape. The duration (45, 47) for a half wave (46, 48) is established, and a half wave (46, 48) is formed within said duration with the number of reference signals (50) established beforehand.

Method to predetermine the welding current to supply a welding apparatus (8), in
particular an AC-TIG electrode and MIG/MAG welding apparatus, in which a direct

voltage produced from an alternating voltage is converted by chopping said direct
voltage into a pulsating direct voltage, and for a fixed given curve immediately

consecutive reference signals (50) are determined, which form a number of half-waves
(14, 18), whereupon for the individual reference signals (50) of the half-waves (46, 48)

an index value corresponding to a specific amplitude is determined, characterised in that
for both a positive and a negative half-wave (46, 48) a curve is determined

independently, and in that accordingly to produce the desired curve of the current the
reference signals (50) for both immediately consecutive half-waves (46, 48) are changed

independently by an index value corresponding to the maximum desired amplitude (55,
56) of the curve, and the period (45, 47) is determined within which a half-wave (46, 48)

is formed with the predetermined number of reference signals (50).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the period (45 and 47) is
calculated and set by the computer (23) by a pulse-duty factor of a frequency (49) or by

inputting a frequency (49) for the positive half-wave (46) and the negative half-wave
(48).
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the reference signals
(50) for each half-wave (46, 48) are saved in a memory (33) as digital values and are

converted in a digital-to-analogue converter (38) by an index value determining the
maximum amplitude of the half-wave (46, 48) to an analogue voltage reference value,

whereupon the current output of the inverter current source (4) is determined depending
on said voltage reference value.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that in the
memory the reference signals (50) for several different curves of one of the two 

immediately consecutive half-waves (46, 48) respectively are stored.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
distance between the individual reference signals (50) is controlled depending on the set

period (45, 47), in particular the frequency (49), and depending on the reference signals
(50) determined for a curve of a half-wave (46, 48) and the set period (45, 47) the

individual references signals (50) are transmitted to the digital-to-analogue converter
(38).
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
period (45, 47) and with that the time interval between the individual reference signals

(50) and/or the index value for the maximum desired amplitude of the curve is changed
during the output of the pulsating direct voltage to the user (7).
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that during
the delivery of the pulsating direct voltage to the user (7) the reference signals (50)

corresponding to a curve of a half-wave (46, 48) are swapped for those of a different
curve of the half-wave (46, 48).
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
change from the reference signals (50) of one curve of the half-wave (46, 48) to the

reference signals (50) of a different curve of the half-wave (46, 48) is performed at zero
passage.

number of reference signals (50) forming a half-wave (46, 48) of two immediately

consecutive half-waves (46, 48) is equal.

which is produced by chopping a direct current produced from an alternating current,

and a memory for storing the reference signals (50) for different curves is connected
before the inverter current source (4), characterised in that the computer (23) is

connected to the memory (33) via an output module (34), which memory is designed to
pick up an ad
dress signal corresponding to a specific curve, and in that a timer (26) with
a counter (30) is connected before the computer (23).
Welding apparatus according to Claim 10, characterised in that the counter (30)
on determining the preset number of count pulses transmits a control signal to the
