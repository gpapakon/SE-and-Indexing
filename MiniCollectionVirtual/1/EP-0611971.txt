<ABSTRACT>
A method for molding optical waveguides (600) 
wherein one or more optical cores (230) are molded first 

with an attached support structure (206). A unitary 
cladding layer (601) is then molded around the cores 

(230) and the support structure (206) is removed to 
provide optical inlet/outlets to the cores (230). The 

ends of the cores (605) where the support structure (206) 
is removed may require subsequent polishing. 
The molding compound injected into mold (100) is made of an optically 
transparent material, such as polymers, epoxies, plastics, polyimides, 

or the like that is selected to be transparent to a desired wavelength 
of light. Generally, refractive indexes of these optically transparent 

materials range from 1.4 to 1.7. Processing conditions for these 
materials range from 22°C to 200°C for molding temperatures and 200 

pounds per square inch to 2,000 pounds per square inch for molding 
pressures. By injecting the molding material, represented by arrow 

(204), into the plurality of cavities (101), intricacies of features 
(104) of mold (100) are transferred to the molding compound. A 

subsequent curing process solidifies the molding compound, thereby 
permanently transferring the intricacies or a negative image of the 

plurality of features (104) to the solidified molding compound, and 
thereby generating optical elements or core regions (230).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to waveguides
and, more particularly, to fabrication of molded
waveguides.At the present time, fabrication of optical
waveguides is achieved by either a polymer spin-on
technique or a diffusion technique, both of which require
expensive lithography steps. In addition, both
fabrication techniques are ineffective and inefficient
for fabricating optical waveguides in high volumes for
several reasons, such as complex processing steps,
difficulties in controlling the processing steps, and the
high cost of doing these processing steps.Briefly, as practiced by one method in the prior
art, a polymeric film is spun onto a substrate. Portions
of the polymeric film are subsequently exposed to light
by a photolithographic process, thereby changing the
refractive index of the polymeric film and creating a
waveguide in the polymeric film. However, subsequent
multi-step processing, such as removal of the polymeric
film from the substrate, lamination processing, curing
processing, and other processes typically are required
for the waveguide to be useful. Further, it should be
noted that each additional processing step incurs an
additional cost, as well as presenting an opportunity to
induce defects into the waveguide.Alternatively, in another method practiced in the
prior art, a layer such as a glass is applied to a
substrate. The layer is patterned by a complicated 
lithography process, thereby producing portions that are
masked and portions that are open or clear. Typically,
ions are subsequently diffused into the open portions of
the layer, thus changing the refractive index of the
layer and making a waveguide. However, by using the
photolithography process, a high cost is incurred into
manufacturing of the waveguide. Also, by using diffusion
processes to change the refractive index of the layer,
control of dimensionality of the waveguide is severely
limited.It can be readily seen that conventional methods
for making waveguides have severe limitations. Also, it
is evident that conventional processing uses a multitude
of steps which are not only complex and expensive, but
also not effective processing. Therefore, a method for
making a waveguide that provides a reduction in the
number of steps required, reduces cost, and simplifies
the process necessary for making a waveguide would be
highly desirable.Briefly stated, an article and method for making a
molded optical waveguide is provided. A first optical
portion and a support apparatus are molded, wherein the
support apparatus holds

molding a first optical portion (230) and a support structure
