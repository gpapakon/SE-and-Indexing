<ABSTRACT>
Compsn. for long-lasting hair styling is based on a keratin-reducing cpd (I), contains no mercapto carboxylic acid esters, and has a pH of 7-7.5. The compsn is prepd. immediately before use by mixing a component A with a component B, where component A contains (I) and has a pH below 7, and component B contains a buffer system and has a pH of 8-10. Also claimed is a long-lasting hair styling process comprising treating the hair with the above compsn. before and/or after styling it; rinsing with water; subjecting the hair to oxidative treatment; rinsing with water; opt. water-waving the hair; and drying the hair.

<CLAIMS>
Agent for the permanent shaping of hair based on a
keratin-reducing compound which is free from mercapto-carboxylic

acid esters and has a pH of from 7 to 7.5,
characterised in that it is prepared immediately prior to use

by mixing two components, one component (component A)
containing the keratin-reducing compound and having a pH of

less than 7, while the other component (component B) contains
a buffer system and has a pH of from 8 to 10, with the

exclusion of an agent in the case of which the keratin-reducing
compound is thioglycolic acid and/or a salt thereof

and, at the same time, component A contains at least one amino
acid chloride and at least one polyol or its methyl or ethyl

ether in aqueous solution and its pH is between approximately
4.5 and 6.5, and component B contains ammonium hydrogen

carbonate, ammonium carbonate and/or ammonium carbamate and
its pH is between approximately 8 and 9.5.
Agent according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
amount of keratin-reducing compound present in the

ready-for-use preparation is from 5 to 20 % by weight.
Agent according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the keratin-reducing compound is selected from

thioglycolic acid or its salts, thiolactic acid or its salts,
2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic acid or its salts, cysteine or

its salts and cysteamine or its salts.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the buffer system is selected from

ammonia, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium carbamate and
mixtures of those compounds. 
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the buffer system has a pH of from 8.5

to 9.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the shaping agent is free from swelling

substances and penetration substances.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that component A contains the

keratin-reducing compound while component B contains the
buffer system and the remaining additives.
Process for the permanent shaping of hair, in which
the hair, before and/or after it has been brought into the

desired shape, is treated with a shaping agent, rinsed with
water, then treated oxidatively, rinsed with water, optionally

arranged in a water wave, and then dried, characterised in
that an agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 7 is used as

the shaping agent.
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in that
the shaping agent is allowed to take effect for from 5 to 30

minutes.
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in that
the shaping treatment is carried out without the action of

heat.
