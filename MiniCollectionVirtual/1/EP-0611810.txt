<ABSTRACT>
An organic composite coated steel strip includes a 
chromate coating on a zinc or zinc base alloy plated steel 

strip having a weight of 5-500 mg/m
2
 calculated as Cr and a 
resin coating on the chromate coating in a dry weight of 

0.1-3 g/m
2
. The resin coating being of a composition 
comprising particulate silica, a binder resin, and 1-10 wt% 

of a polyamide, polyamine or polyimine resin wherein the 
silica particles have an average primary particle size of 5-30 

nm and are agglomerated in the resin coating to form 
laminar aggregates having an average thickness of 0.2-2 µm 

and an average diameter of 5-300 µm. The coated steel strip 
is prepared by forming a chromate coating on a zinc or zinc 

base alloy plated steel strip and applying a coating 
composition to the chromate coating, followed by drying to 

form a resin coating. The coating composition contains (A) 
chain-linked fumed silica or organic solvent-dispersed 

silica sol, (B) a binder resin, and (C) a polyamide, 
polyamine or polyimine resin. The coated steel strip offers 

improved electrocoating properties, especially high image 
clarity after electrocoating as well as improved wet 

adhesion, rust prevention, low-temperature chipping 
resistance, and spot weldability, and is thus suited for 

automotive body outer panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to organic composite coated
steel strips for main use as automotive body steel strips
and more particularly, organic composite coated steel strips
having improved electrocoating properties, especially image
clarity after electrocoating as well as rust prevention,
corrosion resistance, and spot weldability.Supply of various surface treated steel strips is
increasing in these years in order to meet the strong social
demand for enhanced corrosion resistance of automotive
bodies. Typical of such surface treated steel strips are
zinc plated and zinc base alloy plated steel strips (which
are often referred to simply as zinc plated steel strips,
hereinafter). Since paint cannot spread to every detail
upon coating at the end of vehicle body assembly, steel
strips are required to have higher corrosion resistance
especially at hollow structures and hemmed edges within the
body interior which will be exposed to high humidity.One type of steel strip meeting such a demand is
proposed in Japanese Patent Application Kokai (JP-A) Nos.
130141/1991 and 258335/1990. Disclosed therein are organic
composite coated steel strips based on a zinc plated steel 
strip and having thereon a chromate layer and an organic
resin layer containing silica. Since these organic
composite coated steel strips are fully corrosion resistant
even without paint coating at the end of vehicle body
assembly, they are frequently used in the body interior.The situation differs at the automotive body exterior
or surface side. The exterior is subject to lower humidity
than the interior. Paint coating at the end of vehicle body
assembly can spread over the entire surface to a thickness
of about 100 µm (electrocoating plus intermediate coating
plus overcoating). The likelihood that rust on the exterior
side penetrate throughout the wall is less than on the
interior side. For these reasons, steel strips are
conventionally used with their cold rolled surface at the
body exterior side. As corrosion resistance requirements
for automobile bodies become severer, rust prevention
requirements at the body exterior side also become severer.
Then steel strips which are also surface treated on the
exterior side are now in practical use. For example, steel
strips surface treated by zinc plating are used in practice
because they exhibit greater rust prevention than cold
rolled steel strips.Nevertheless, zinc plated steel strips are less
satisfactory in plating adherence and thus less resistant
against low-temperature chipping. When paint is
