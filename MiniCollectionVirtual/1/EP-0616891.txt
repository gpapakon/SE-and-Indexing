<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus
and method of controlling same.There are two types of jet printers. A
piezoelectric vibration type is designed to jet ink droplets
by expanding and contracting pressure chambers by
piezoelectric vibration elements. And a thermal type is
designed to arrange heating means within pressure chambers
and jet an ink by taking advantage of pressure produced by
instantly gasifying the ink while supplying electric energy
to the heating means.Particularly, the recording head of the former type
that produces ink droplets by extension and contraction of
the piezoelectric vibration elements repeats at a
predetermined cycle the process of: contracting the
piezoelectric vibration elements so as to expand the pressure
chambers before jetting the ink, thereby introducing the ink 
into the pressure chambers; extending the piezoelectric
vibration elements so as to correspond to a print signal
inputted after a predetermined time elapses thereafter; and
jetting ink droplets from nozzle openings by the pressure
thereby produced.Since dots are formed on a recording sheet by
splashing ink droplets a predetermined distance between the
head and the sheet, the print quality is affected by the ink
droplet splashing speed with the ink droplets being affected
by the gravitational force, the speed of movement of the
recording head, and the like. To improve the print quality,
the ink droplet splashing speed must be increased as much as
possible.Since the ink droplet splashing speed depends on the
piezoelectric vibration element extension speed which is used
for the recording head, the speed of varying a drive signal
voltage must be increased as much as possible.However, the piezoelectric vibration element is
subjected to residual vibration at the self resonance
frequency after an ink droplet has been jetted once the
extension speed thereof exceeds a certain value. Thus, a so-called
"satellite" with small ink droplets is produced after
the ink droplet has been jetted, from which arises a problem
of further impairment of the print quality. Prior art document US-A-4523200 discloses an extension process
of a piezoelectric vibration element which is interrupted by
first applying a main pulse and then applying an auxiliary
pulse, both pulses being separated from each other by a zero
voltage period. The apparatus described in this document deals
with the spurious satellite droplet problem and uses about a
quarter of the characteristic vibration period.It is an object of the
