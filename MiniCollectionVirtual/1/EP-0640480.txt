<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet print head according to the present invention has a 
plurality of pressure chambers divided by side walls at least partially 

formed of a piezoelectric member, applies voltage to electrodes formed 
on surface of side walls, and jet ink in the pressure chambers through 

ink jets by causing deformation of shearing strain mode to the side walls. 
Each one of the side walls disposed on both sides of the pressure 

chambers has different operating characteristics. The volume of the ink 
to be jetted can be changed in three ways by selectively deforming 

either side of the side walls of the pressure chamber from which the ink 
is to be jetted or by deforming both sides of the side walls of the 

pressure chamber simultaneously. Accordingly, gradation can be 
acquired by simply constructed apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drop-on-demand ink jet print
head mounted on an ink jet printer and a method of driving the same.A conventional ink jet print head is disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-open (Kokai) No. Sho 63-247051. Fig. 1 shows a passage (a
pressure chamber) having a hard wall on one side and a shearing strain
actuator wall on the other side. The shearing strain actuator wall
consists of piezoelectric ceramic. An upper portion and a lower portion
of these walls are joined to each other on their boundary surfaces
thereof. They are also fixedly joined to a top wall and a bottom wall.
Metallized metal electrodes are formed on surfaces of the both walls of
the shearing strain actuator disposed on one side of the two side walls.In the above-described ink jet printer having the shearing strain
actuator on one side of the two side walls, the actuator wall is deformed
toward the passage and thus pressure is provided to ink throughout the
entire length of the passage, as a shearing deformation is caused in the
piezoelectric ceramic by applying a pulse voltage between the electrodes.
If the pressure against the ink thus applied is beyond the predetermined
minimum value, the ink is jetted is extracted through a nozzle.Also, Fig. 9 (a) in the above mentioned Laid-open discloses the ink
jet print head having a pair of shearing strain actuators formed on both
sides of passage walls. An upper and lower portions of the passage
consist of a top wall and a bottom wall. Electrodes of the actuators are
formed on an inner surface of the passage and two surfaces on outside of
both walls of the passage in the form of metal electrodes. In the ink jet print head having the shearing strain actuators
formed on both passage walls, when voltage is applied across the
electrodes on the inner surface of the passage and the electrodes on the
outside of the both walls of the passage, the equal amount of electric
field is provided to the actuators on each wall of the passage reversely.
Therefore, each wall facing the passage is deformed toward the passage
and pressure is provided to ink in the passage thereby to jet an ink
droplet through the passage.The above mentioned Laid-open also describes that the size of an
ink droplet can be controlled by changing the voltage to be applied.However, the conventional ink jet print heads stated above have
following disadvantages. There has been a large demand for graphic
printing lately by requirements of users and an improvement of Host
computer, etc. In order to print a graphic
