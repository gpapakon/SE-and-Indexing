<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for controlling an automatic transmission of a motor vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine. The proposal is to determine the position of a throttle valve of the vehicle and the acceleration of the vehicle in response to this position and to relate these two variables. This relationship is then compared with the relationship which occurs in normal driving on the flat. Depending on the deviation between the actual relationship and the normal relationship, the ratios are displaced towards higher engine speeds, which means that the ratio assigned to a throttle-valve position and an engine speed is now reached at a lower engine speed or that the engine speed level is increased. For a step-change transmission, it is proposed to provide a plurality of gear-change maps and to carry out the displacement of the ratio on a changing gear-change map depending on the deviation. For a continuously variable transmission, which has a plurality of control characteristics, the invention makes the similar proposal of performing the displacement to the ratio by changing control characteristics depending on the ratio.

A method for controlling an automatic transmission of a
motor vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine, wherein

the internal combustion engine may be influenced by means of a
power control element, preferably an accelerator pedal or a

throttle valve, and gear ratios of the transmission are
automatically selected at least in dependence on the position

of the power control element (alpha(t)) and the engine revs
(nmot(t)), characterised in that


a reaction of the vehicle to the position of the power
control element (alpha(t)) is ascertained,
a relationship is established between the position of the
power control element (alpha(t)) and a reaction of the vehicle

thereto, the reaction of the vehicle being detected by a
change in road speed (dv(t)/dt),
deviation of this relationship from a relationship
prevailing during normal driving on the level is ascertained

and
the gear ratios are shifted up to higher engine revs

depending on the deviation.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
shifting of the gear ratio increases in magnitude and speed

with the deviation and is implemented in accordance with PT1

A device for controlling an automatic transmission of a
motor vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine,

comprising

a sensor for the position of a power control element (6)
of the internal combustion engine, preferably an accelerator

pedal or a throttle valve,
a sensor for the engine revs (nmot(t)) of the internal
combustion engine (7) and
at least one gear-change characteristic map (SKFj) or at 
least one control characteristic for automatically

determining a gear ratio of a transmission connected on the
output side of the internal combustion engine from the signals

of the sensors, characterised in that
a sensor (8) for the road speed (v(t)) with a
differentiating means connected on the output side thereof for

determining a reaction of the vehicle to the position of the
power control element (alpha(t)) is also provided,
a first comparison means establishes a relationship between
the signal for the position of the power control element

(alpha(t)) and the signal for the reaction of the vehicle
thereto,
a second comparison means ascertains deviation of the
signal of the first comparison means from a signal of the

first comparison means prevailing during normal driving on the
level, and
a shifting means acting on the gear-change characteristic
map (SKFj) shifts the gear ratios up to higher engine revs

depending on the deviation.
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
first comparison means and the second comparison means are

combined into a characteristic map (27) which determines an
intermediate variable (SKP1(t)) depending on a change in the

road speed (dv(t)/dt) and the position of the power control
element (alpha(t)).
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that a
PT1 filter is connected on the output side of the

characteristic map (27) and in accordance with the filtered
intermediate variable (SKP1(t)) the shifting means acting on

the gear-change characteristic map (SKFj) shifts the gear
ratios up to higher engine revs depending on the deviation,

the shift increasing in amount and magnitude as the
intermediate variable (SKP1(t)) increases.

characteristic map (27) is additionally dependent on the set

optimum-performance operation are provided, by means of which

gear ratios are automatically selected at least in dependence
on the position of the power control element (alpha(t)) and

the engine revs (nmot(t)), and which differ in the position of
the gear-change characteristics at which a change of gear

ratio occurs,
several characteristic maps (27) are provided for
ascertaining the relationship between the position of the

power control element (alpha(t)) and the reaction of the
vehicle, one of which is used in accordance with the set gear

ratio to determine an intermediate variable (SKP1(t))
depending on a change in the road speed (dv(t)/dt) and the

position of the power control element (alpha(t)),
the intermediate variable (SKPl(t)) is multiplied by a
factor dependent on the road speed (v(t)) which progressively

decreases the value of the intermediate variable (SKPl(t)) as
the road speed (v(t)) increases

PT1 filter and
finally the gear-change characteristic map (SKFj) to be used

variable (SKPl(t)) to shift the gear ratio, gear-change
