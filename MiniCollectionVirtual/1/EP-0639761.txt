<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a differential pressure sensor (transducer) of capacitive type, comprising means defining a first chamber subjected to a first pressure, means defining a second chamber subjected to a second pressure, and means defining a third, so-called reference, chamber, isolated from the said first and second chambers by respective diaphragms and in which a so-called reference pressure prevails, the sensor furthermore comprising two capacitors, each having a pair of electrodes (plates), one of the electrodes of each pair being associated with one of the said diaphragms in order to vary the capacitance of the capacitor under the action of the pressure to which its diaphragm is subjected, characterised in that the said electrodes line wall portions of the said third chamber and in that the other electrodes of each of the said pairs of electrodes are provided on the same face of a common substrate forming the base of the structure of the said sensor.
