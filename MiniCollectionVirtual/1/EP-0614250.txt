<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) is provided for 
surface mounting along an edge (14) of a circuit board (16) 

in an edge straddling configuration. The circuit board has 
a plurality of contact pads (18, 38) spaced along opposite 

faces (16a, 16b) of the board near the edge thereof. The 
connector includes a dielectric housing (20) and a 

plurality of terminals mounted on the housing with solder 
tails (32, 34) projecting from the housing generally in two 

rows to define an elongate board-receiving mouth (36) for 
receiving the edge (14) of the circuit board. The contact 

pads are adapted to receive soft solder paste (19, 39) 
thereon prior to insertion of the board into the mouth 

between the two rows of solder tails. The solder tails of 
the terminals are configured for receiving the circuit 

board at a first angular orientation wherein minimal 
contact force is effected between the solder tails and the 

contact pads to prevent any substantial wiping away of the 
solder paste from the contact pads and a second angular 

orientation wherein substantial contact force is effected 
between the solder tails and the contact pads in a 

direction generally normal to the faces of the circuit 
board. Therefore, the solder paste remains in an interface 

area at each contact pad and its respective solder tail.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a system for 
surface mounting an electrical connector assembly along an 
edge of a circuit board in an edge straddling 
configuration. There are a wide variety of electrical connectors 
adapted for surface mounting on a printed circuit board. 
Some such connectors are mounted to one side of the circuit 
board and include solder tails for surface mounting to 
contact pads on the side of the board or for insertion into 
holes in the circuit board for soldering to circuit traces 
interconnected to the holes. Other such connectors are 
adapted for mounting along an edge of the circuit board, 
with solder tails of the terminals engageable with contact 
pads on one or both sides of the board adjacent the edge. 
The latter type of connectors commonly are called "edge 
connectors" and, when the solder tails engage contacts on 
both sides of the board along the edge, the connectors 
commonly are called "straddle mount" connectors. A further connector is known for example from JP-U-52-51667 which is suitable for soldered contact with the pcb, and also shows the principle of oblique insertion. One of the problems encountered with straddle 
mount connectors is that soft solder paste or cream is 
removed from vital portions of the board contact pads if 
there is a sliding engagement between the tails and the 
pads during positioning of the board and the connector in 
such a straddle mount condition. In a straddle mount 
connector system, the board must be inserted in a slot or 
mouth defined between solder tails engageable with contact 
pads on both opposite sides of the board in a straddling  
 
configuration. Soft solder paste is applied to the contact 
pads on both sides of the board before the board is 
inserted into the connector. It is desirable to have a 
predetermined contact force between the solder tails and 
the board contact pads, in a direction normal to the board, 
to provide good electrical contact points. On the other 
hand, it is desirable to have zero or minimal forces 
between the solder tails and the contact pads while 
positioning the solder tails on the contact pads to prevent 
the soft solder paste from being wiped off of the contact 
pads which can result in defective solder interfaces or 
short circuiting between adjacent contact pads. Various approaches have been made in the 
connector industry to solve the problems outlined above.
