<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to shaped articles 
such as fibers and films of cellulose esters. The 
present invention also relates to a production solution 
capable of producing the shaped articles at increased 
production speeds. The present invention also relates 
to a process for producing these shaped articles from 
the production solution. Shaped articles such as fibers and films of 
cellulose esters produced by the extrusion of a 
cellulose ester production solution are well known. 
Cellulose esters are produced from a cellulosic 
feedstock such as wood pulp or cotton linters. The 
cellulose ester is precipitated after acetylation and 
hydrolysis, is then washed and dried, and then 
redissolved in cellulose ester solvents such as aqueous 
acetone, or methylene chloride/alcohol. This solution 
is then filtered to form a production solution. The 
shaped articles are then produced from this production 
solution or extrudable solution by solvent evaporation 
techniques such as dry spinning to form fibers. High production speeds are very desirable in that 
more shaped product can be formed during a set period of 
time than at lower production speeds. This is 
particularly important for the production of cellulose 
acetate fiber from a cellulose acetate/acetone dope 
solution by the dry spinning technique. Spinning speeds 
seem to be limited by the residence time required to  
 
remove the solvent from the wet filaments through 
diffusion and evaporation, and by reduced strength of 
the spinline while large quantities of solvent are 
present. Spinning speeds are also limited by the 
presence of non-uninformities in the dope such as 
particles, rheological inhomogeneities etc. which 
interact with the bulk rheological properties of the 
dope and with the spinning conditions. Spinning speeds 
can be increased by incorporating appropriate additives 
or diluents to drop the viscosity of the cellulose 
acetate/acetone solution. For example U.S. 3,272,638 
discloses the addition of sugar to the spinning solution 
to increase the spinning rate, and U.S. 4,418,026 
discloses the addition of poly(ethylene) glycol to the 
spinning solution to improve the spinnability. The 
methods of increasing the dry spinning spinnability of 
cellulose acetate/acetone solution by changing the 
viscosity of the spinning solution is limited by the 
thread spinline or threadline strength of the spinning 
medium. U.S. 3,952,081 discloses an alternative method 
of increasing the spinning speed of cellulose acetate 
fibers that
