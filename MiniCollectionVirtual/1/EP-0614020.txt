<ABSTRACT>
Operations on a living human body require metallic auxiliary instruments, such as devices (7) for flexibly holding rotary tools (4). The torque is introduced via a shaft (3) and transmitted to the tool (4) via a flexible torque transmission device (2). The torque transmission device (2) consists of the two end bodies (2a, 2b), which are connected to one another by a flexible region (2c). The flexible region (2c) consists of a flexible strip (2d) which is wound helically around the axis (6) such that the strips (2d) do not touch one another. The torque transmission device (2) thus has a spring action in the axial direction (6) and transversely to the axial direction (6).

An operating instrument for flexibly holding rotating 
tools (4) for working on solid materials inside the 

living human body, consisting of metallic parts arranged 
one after the another in the axial direction (6), a tool 

holder (1), to which a tool (4) is detachably attached, 
a flexible torque transmission device (2) connected to 

the tool holder (1) and also a shaft (3) connected to the 
torque transmission device (2), via which a torque is 

introduced,
characterised in that
 the tool holder (4), the torque 
transmission device (2) and also the shaft (3) are 

constructed in one piece, 

and in that
 at each end the flexible torque transmission 
device (2) comprises a fixed end member (2a, 2b) and 

therebetween a flexible region (2c), 
in that
 the flexible region (2c) consists of at least one 
helical strip (2d) having several windings, which is connected to the corresponding end members (2a, 2b), 
in that
 the strips (2d) have a cross section in which the 
larger dimension extends radially to the axial direction 

(6), 
and in that
 adjacent windings have a mutual spacing (2g) 
at least on their periphery in the axial direction. 
An operating instrument according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 at least two helical strips (2d) 
connect the two end members (2a. 2b) via at least one 

winding each. 
An operating instrument according to one of Claims 1 or 
2,
characterised in that
 the helical strips (2d) on the 
inner side faced towards the axis (6) have a common  

 
internal connection (2k) extending in the axial 

direction. 
An operating instrument according to one of Claims 1 or 
2,
characterised in that
 on the inner side faced towards the 
axis (6) the helical strips (2d) have a common, 

cylindrical connection (2f) extending in the axial 
direction. 
An operating instrument according to one of Claims 1 to 
4,
characterised in that
 at the end faced away from flexible 
torque transmission device (2) the shaft (3) comprises a 

handle (5) for the manual introduction of the torque. 
An operating instrument according to one of Claims 1 to 
4,
characterised in that
 at the end region faced away from 
the flexible torque transmission device (2) the shaft (3) 

is designed in such a manner, e.g. with coupling recesses 
(3a), that the shaft (3) can be connected to a motorised 

driving device. 
An operating instrument according to one of Claims 1 to 
6,
characterised in that
 the tool holder (1) comprises a 
detachable means (la) for clamping rotating tools (4). 
An operating instrument according to one of Claims 1 to 
7,
characterised in that
 the tool (4) is a drill bit, a 
screw driver or a milling cutter.
