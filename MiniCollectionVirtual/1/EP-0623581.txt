<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process for
the transesterification of carboxylic acid esters, using a non-acidic
heterogeneous catalyst.The transesterification of carboxylic esters and
derivatives thereof is a well-known method for preparing
various commercially very interesting chemicals, such as
glycerol and fatty acid esters, which can be used as
intermediates for other important chemicals. A variety of
processes is available therefor, all of which either use a
homogeneous catalyst or a heterogeneous catalyst.The transesterification of carboxylic acid esters
comprises three groups of reactions, namely the
transesterification with an alkanol, or alcoholysis, the
transesterification with a carboxylic acid (or anhydride),
the acidolysis, and the transesterification with a
carboxylic acid ester. Of these reactions especially the
alcoholysis of triglycerides is important.In (trans)esterification reactions numerous
homogeneous catalysts have been disclosed in the literature.
Examples thereof are acids such as hydrochloric acid,
sulfuric acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid and benzene sulfonic
acid. Alkaline materials like alkali alkoxides and alkaline
earth carbonates have also been disclosed. Another group of
homogeneous catalysts that have been disclosed in the
literature are based on the transition metal compounds with
alkoxy or acyl groups, titanium chelates and titanium tin
complexes.The use of homogeneous catalysts of the types
described hereinabove has various disadvantages. Both the
acid and the alkaline materials lead to the formation of
byproducts, and additionally it is required that the
reaction product is neutralized at the end of the reaction. 
Presently a commercial catalyst for the methanolysis of
triglycerides is sodium-methoxide, which has the
disadvantage that the products become contaminated with
sodium.The alkaline catalysts, including those based upon
the transition metals, are not resistant against the
presence of water in the feed; they lead to unacceptable
coloration of the product and they pose environmental
problems.US patent specification 4,032,550 discloses an
immobilized supported transition metal catalyst for direct
esterification or ester-interchange. According to this
patent generally titanium alkoxides have been used as
precursor for the catalyst. However, those supported
catalysts are not very easy to prepare in a reproducible
manner and depending on the properties of the support they
may lead to the production of unwanted byproducts.In DE-A 2710630 a process for the
