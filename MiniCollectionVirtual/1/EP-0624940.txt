<ABSTRACT>
This relates to the equipping of trunking which comprises a body (11), having bent-back edges (returns) (12) facing each other, and a cover (13) to be clipped onto these bent-back edges (12). According to the invention, this trunking also comprises a cover joint (16) which extends transversely from one of the bent-back edges (12) of the body (11) to the other, in order to cover over the end of the cover (13), and which, at at least one of its ends, is equipped with a fastener (locking member) (18) suitable for locking it onto the corresponding bent-back edge (12) of the body (11). Application to trunking, especially for electrical apparatus.

A ducting of the type comprising on the one hand a body (11) 

with flange portions (12) which are directed towards each other and on 
the other hand a cover (13) to be latched on to said flange portions 

(12), characterised in that it also comprises a cover join (16) which 
extends transversely from one of the flange portions (12) of the body 

(11) to the other to cover the end of the cover (13) and which at one of 
its ends at least is provided with a locking member (18) comprising a 

latch portion (19), said locking member (18) being mounted movably 
between a locking position in which the latch portion (19) is engaged 

under the corresponding flange portion (12) of the body (11) and an 
unlocking position in which the latch portion (19) is spaced from said 

flange portion (12). 
A ducting according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
locking member (18) is mounted rotatably on the cover join (16) and has 

at the surface thereof a control head (21) which is accessible to the 
user. 
A ducting according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
locking member (18) is latched by means of its shaft in a well portion 

(24) which projects at the back of the cover join (16). 
A ducting according to either one of claims 2 and 3 
characterised in that the latch portion (19) of the locking member (18) 

is a simple plate portion which extends radially in cantilever 
relationship from its shaft (23). 
A ducting according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised 
in that, for co-operation with a flange portion (12) of the body (11), 

the latch portion (19) of the locking member (18) comprises an 
elastically deformable blade portion (28).  

 
A ducting according to claims 4 and 5 in combination 
characterised in that the elastically deformable blade portion (28) 

extends by way of a notch (29) in the latch portion (19), substantially 
in accordance with the thickness thereof. 
A ducting according to any one of claims 1 to 6 characterised 
in that, for one at least of the positions of the locking member (18), 

indexing means are provided between the locking member (18) and the cover 
join (16). 
A ducting according to any one of claims 2 to 7 characterised 
in that the control head (21) of the locking member (18) carries an 

indicator mark (34) showing the positioning of the latch portion (19). 
A ducting according to any one of claims 1 to 8 characterised 
in that the cover join (16) is provided with a locking member (18) only 

at one of its ends and at the other of its ends it comprises in 
projecting relationship at its back a hook (36) for engagement thereof on 

the corresponding flange portion (12) of the body (11). 
A ducting according to claim 9 characterised in that for cooperating 
with a flange portion (12) of the body (11) the hook (36) of 

the cover join (16) comprises an elastically deformable blade portion 
(28'). 
A ducting according to claim 10 characterised in that, the 
hook (36) being formed by a leg portion (38) and a cantilevered flange 

portion (39), the elastically deformable blade portion (28') extends by 
way of a notch (29') in said flange portion (39), substantially in 

accordance with the thickness thereof. 
A ducting according to any one of claims 9 to 11 
characterised in that, for adaptation thereof to different widths of 

cover (13), the cover join (16) comprises in projecting relationship at  
 

its back and arranged at spaced locations over its length a plurality of 
hooks (36A, 36B, 36C) with, extending transversely over its entire width, 

between said hooks (36A, 36B, 36C), regions (40) of less resistance 
which, each provided between two hooks (36A, 36B, 36C), are adapted to 

divide up the cover join. 
A ducting according to either one of claims 5 and 11 
characterised in that, to bear against a flange portion (12) of the cover 

(11), an elastically deformable blade portion (28, 28') is transversely 
provided in projecting relationship with a ridge portion (30, 30'). 
A ducting according to any one of claims 1 to 13 
characterised in that, the flange portions (12) of the body (11) being 

generally shaped in a gutter-like configuration, the cover join (16) 
comprises a transverse rib (42) in projecting relationship at its back, 

at each of its ends, for engagement into such a flange portion (12). 
A ducting according to claims 12 and 14 in combination 
characterised in that a transverse rib (42) is associated with each of the 

hooks (36A, 36B, 36C) of the cover join (16). 
A ducting according to claim 14 characterised in that, for 
limiting its engagement into the flange portions (12) of the body (11), 

the cover join (16) comprises at least locally in projecting relationship 
at its back a longitudinal rib (44) of a height which is less than that 

of its transverse ribs (42). 
A ducting according to any one of claims 1 to 16 
characterised in that all the elements that the cover join (16) comprises 

in projecting relationship at its back such as well portions (24), hooks 
(36) and ribs (42, 46) extend transversely only in the central region, 

set back with respect to its longitudinal edges.
