<ABSTRACT>
The magnetic tape cartridge having a self docking leader block makes use of guide slots formed in the interior surface of the top and bottom plates of the cartridge housing, juxtaposed to the leader block opening in the housing, to mate with corresponding projections on the leader block. The guide slots are open at one end to capture the projections on the leader block and shaped to precisely guide the leader block along a predefined path into the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic tape 
cartridges and, in particular, to an improved 
leader block that is attached to one end of the 
magnetic tape contained in the magnetic tape 
cartridge and which is self docking when the tape 
is rewound back into the cartridge. It is a problem in the field of 3480-type 
magnetic tape cartridges to provide a leader block 
that securely and precisely fastens to one end of 
the magnetic tape contained in the magnetic tape 
cartridge while also being simple to install on the 
magnetic tape without the use of complicated tools. 
A misalignment of the magnetic tape to the leader 
block can result in the cartridge and the leader 
block becoming jammed in the tape drive. Existing 
leader blocks in use on 3480-type magnetic tape 
cartridges require the use of special installation 
tools to attain the required alignment between the 
magnetic tape and the leader block which makes 
field installation of leader blocks on the 3480-type 
magnetic tape cartridges a difficult task. These existing leader blocks are oriented such 
that the magnetic tape exits the leader block from 
the side. The side exit of the tape from the 
leader block places a strain on the magnetic tape  
 
and can interfere with the fit between the leader block and the 
takeup reel. When the leader block is fully inserted into the 
takeup reel, the leader block forms a part of the outer 
circumference of the takeup reel and thus the magnetic tape 
winding surface. Any misalignment of the magnetic tape to the 
leader block or a failure to properly seat the leader block in 
the takeup reel results in a non-uniform tape winding surface 
which causes undesirable impressions in the magnetic tape as it 
is wrapped on the takeup reel. Finally, special leader block 
docking mechanisms must be employed on the tape drive in order 
to smoothly seat the leader block in the magnetic tape cartridge. While this existing leader block apparatus is fairly reliable in 
its operation, the above noted limitations represent detrimental 
design limitations contained therein. EP-A-0143592 discloses an example of such a magnetic tape 
cartridge comprising: 
a substantially rectangular housing, including a top plate 
and a bottom plate, having an opening in one corner thereof, for 
enclosing a single reel of magnetic tape rotatably mounted within 
said housing; a leader block attached to one end of said magnetic tape, 
wherein said leader block has a top and a bottom, and includes 
an aperture in a first side for receiving a first

A magnetic tape cartridge, comprising: 

a substantially rectangular housing (300), including a top 
plate (604) and a bottom plate (603), having an opening (301) in 

one corner thereof, for enclosing a single reel of magnetic tape 
(103) rotatably mounted within said housing (300); 
a leader block (100) attached to one end of said magnetic 
tape (103), wherein said leader block (100) has a top (111) and 

a bottom (112), and includes an aperture in a first side (115) 
for receiving a first end of said magnetic tape (103), 
a first slot (302) inscribed in an interior surface of said 
top plate (604) of said housing (300) proximate said opening 

(301), and having a first end (601) open to said opening (301) 
in said housing (300) to guide said leader block (100) into said 

opening(301); and 
a second slot (302) inscribed in an interior surface of said 
bottom plate (603) of said housing (300) proximate said opening 

(301), and having a first end (601) open to said opening (301) 
in said housing (300) to guide said leader block (100) into said 

opening (301); 
 
   characterised in that said leader block (100) is provided 

with first (126; 606) and second (127; 605) docking pins located 
on and projecting from said top (111) and bottom (112), 

respectively, of said leader block (100), proximate said first 
side (115) thereof, for engaging in said first and second slots 

(302) to guide said leader block (100) into said opening (301), 
said first and second slots (302) defining a non-linear path for 

said docking pins.  
 
A magnetic tape cartridge according to claim 1, wherein said 
docking pins (126, 127) are cylindrical. 
A magnetic tape cartridge according to claim 1, wherein said 
docking pins (606, 605) are semi-cylindrical with the curved 

surface thereof facing in the same direction as said first side 
(115). 
A magnetic tape cartridge according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein said first slot (302) has a second end (602) closed 

to stop movement of said leader block (100) into said housing 
(300) by engaging said first docking pin (126; 606) on said
