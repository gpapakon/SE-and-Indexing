<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a light source (10) supplying a beam modulated by the incoming signal and scanning, at the rate fixed by a clock, along a generatrix of a photosensitive drum (16) driven in rotation by a motor (18), and comprising means (44) for storing incoming data representing the successive pixels of all the analysis lines of a document page, means (41) for determining the length to be reproduced of the document transmitted and determining the width to be reproduced. It additionally comprises means for calculating the vertical reduction ratios (Rv) and (Rh) to be adopted in order to restore the useful information and to adopt the smallest ratio, and means for controlling the frequency of the clock and the motor of the drum so as to obtain the said smallest reduction ratio in the horizontal and vertical directions.

Method for facsimile printing on paper sheets of 
predetermined and cons
tant size, comprising, for each 
transmitted page of document, storing the pixels of all 

scanned lines of each page in turn, determining the number 
of lines having a predetermined spacing to be printed and 

printing the page pixel per pixel, one line after the other, 
characterized by determining the height which contains 

information as a number of scanned lines, computing the 
vertical reduction ratio Rv to be used for printing all 

lines which contain useful information and printing the 
sheet with a spacing between lines of pixels such that all 

useful lines be contained in the usable length. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized by 
reducing the spacing of pixels along each line in the same 

ratio as the spacing between lines. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized computing 
a horizontal reduction ratio Rh between the available 

printing width and the maximum scanned width to be 
reproduced, determining which one of the two vertical and 

horizontal ratios is smaller and using the smaller reduction 
ratio for controlling the vertical spacing between lines of 

pixels and the spacing between pixels of a same line during 
printing. 
Printing apparatus for facsimile machine, comprising 
a light source (10) delivering a beam which is modulated by 

the input signal and scanning, at a rate fixed by a clock, 
a generatrix line of a photosensitive drum (16) driven in 

rotation by a motor (18) and comprising means (44) for 
storing input data which represent successive pixels of all 

scanned lines of a page of document,
 
   characterized by means (41) for determining the length 

to be reproduced on the transmitted document, for instance 
as a number of scanning lines having a given set value and  

 
for determining the length, for instance as a number of 

analyzed pixels, necessary to avoid truncating the 
information contained in all scanned lines in width, means 

for computing the vertical reduction ratio Rv and horizontal 
reduction ratio Rh to be used for reproducing the useful 

information and for adopting the smaller ratio, and means 
for controlling the frequency of the clock and the motor of 

the drum for obtaining said smaller reduction ratio in the 
horizontal and vertical directions. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the motor (18) is a DC servo-controlled motor whose speed is 

controlled by a control unit responsive to the reduction 
ratio to be obtained. 
Device according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that energization of the beam is controlled by a clock for 

obtaining said smaller reduction ratio.
