<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement of limit position switches in a linear adjusting drive which is driven by electric motors, especially a drive for points, in the case of which drive limit position switches signal that the right-hand or left-hand limit position of the drive has been reached. In order to ensure that these limit-position switches can emit an alignment message only when the drive is actually latched in the limit position, that is to say sticking or fused contacts of the limit position switches cannot be confused with a limit position having been reached, which can lead to dangerous situations, it is proposed according to the invention that slide-type momentary-contact switches having additional mechanical positive operation of the contacts in both switching directions be used for the limit position switches (13/13') instead of roller momentary-contact switches. Each limit position switch (13/13') is expediently fitted at the end of its operating shaft (16) with an axially directed link in which a transversely located operating bolt (19 or 19' respectively) engages, which can be moved by the associated release lever (12 or 12' respectively). The link can have the form of a pulley (17) with a broadened pulley groove (18), the operating bolt (19 or 19' respectively) engaging in the pulley groove (18) with axial play in the switch operating direction.

Arrangement for actuating the limit switches in
an electromotively operated linear adjustment drive, in

particular a point-operating machine, in which the driven
actuating rod is assigned, in specific end positions,

tripping levers, of which, in the end positions (right or
left), in each case one tripping lever (12) is engaged by

means of a fixedly connected tracer roller into an
actu
ating rod recess assigned thereto, whilst the other
tripping lever (12'), being displaced transversely, has

been lifted out, and vice versa, the displacement of the
tripping levers alternately changing over the associated

limit switches which, as touch-contact switches with
spring return, each have a pair of break and make contacts

and which are provided jointly for forming a test
current loop, for changing over the motor windings after

a starting phase to three-phase operation and for emitting
sequence signals when the end positions are reached,

characterized in that, when sliding touch-contact
switches with additional positive mechanical actuation of

the contacts in both switching directions are used for
the limit switches (13, 13'), each limit switch (13, 13')

carries, at the end of its actuating shaft (16), an
axially directed slot, into which engages a transverse

actuating bolt (19 or 19') which can be moved by the
associated tripping lever (12, 12'), and, in this case,

the slot has the form of a roller (17) with a widened
running groove (18), the actuating bolt (19, 19') engaging

into the running roller (18) with axial play in the
switch actuation direction.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the limit switches (13, 13') fastened in the

drive housing (G) are each surrounded by a hood, in such
a way that the roller (17) or the actuating bolt (19,

19') is prevented from falling off or falling out even
after the components have been released.
