<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention to provide a mineral wool mat with a surface weight as constant as possible. The mineral wool is produced in a line, in which a mineral melt converted into fibres is collected so as to form a thin primary wool mat on a conveyor, which leads to a suspended swing tray conveyor (2) depositing the primary wool mat on a receiving conveyor so as to form a secondary wool mat comprising several layers. The object is achieved by providing the receiving conveyor (1) with means (4) for weighing a surface weight of the secondary wool mat (6) formed on the receiving conveyor (1) and by connecting the weighing means (4) through a regulator to a driving motor (5) of the receiving conveyor (1) for the control of the speed of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A device in a mineral wool production lineThe present invention relates to a device in a mineral wool production line, in which production'V 5 line a mineral melt converted into fibres is collect¬ ed so as to form a thin primary wool mat on a convey¬ or, which leads to a suspended swing tray conveyor depositing the primary wool mat on a receiving con¬ veyor so as to form a secondary wool mat comprising 10 several layers.In the manufacture of mineral wool, a mineral melt is converted into fibres by means of a spinning machine provided with a blow-off blowing the fibres formed into a fibre collecting chamber, while unde- 15 fibrated solidified small melt particles, called beads, are separated from the fibre. The formed fibre is collected on a conveyor so as to form a thin fibre mat, called primary wool mat, which is transported further to a suspended swing tray conveyor depositing 20 it on a slow moving receiving conveyor. Through this is formed a secondary wool mat comprising many lay¬ ers.The intention of pendulous deposition is to re¬ duce the variations in volume weight of the secondary 25 wool mat in order to provide an even wool distribu¬ tion across the breadth of the whole production line.The primary wool mat with a surface weight of 200 to 400 g per m2 is deposited pendulously so as to form a secondary wool mat having usually at least six 30 layers on a receiving conveyor, which moves at a 90° angle towards the arriving wool mat and runs at syn¬ chronous speed with the subsequent line.In connection with a given product thickness, the volume weight or the surface weight is one of the35 most important quality parameters to be kept within 

 certain given limits at the manufacture.On account of the variations in the melt flow to the spinning machine, the fibre production varies per time unit and thus also the surface weight of the primary mat.The speed of the receiving conveyor is control¬ led in order to compensate for these variations in the primary mat, for which compensation have been used different measuring signals, such as power con- sumption of the spinning machine, underpressure in the wool collecting chamber etc., in order to obtain an early indication of changes in the momentary vol¬ ume of the fibre production per time unit. These aux¬ iliary signals are not absolute and there is no sta- ble connection between these signals and the fibre production.Attempts have been made to weigh the primary wool mat, but owing to the low surface weight and the high speed of the primary mat, a weighing

Claims :
1. A device in a mineral wool production line, in which production line a mineral melt converted into fibres is collected so as to form a thin primary wool mat on a conveyor, which leads to a suspended swing tray conveyor (2) depositing the primary wool mat on a receiving conveyor so as to form a secondary wool mat comprising several layers, c h a r a c - t e r i z e d in that the receiving conveyor comprises a por¬ tion (1) positioned substantially below the suspended swing tray conveyor and provided with means (4) for weighing the surface weight of the secondary wool mat (6) formed on said portion (1) and that the weighing means (4) are connected through a regulator to a driving motor (5) of said portion (1) in order to control its speed in such a way that, in spite of variations in the surface weight of the primary wool mat, a secondary wool mat (6) with an accurately constant surface weight is obtained.
2. A device according to claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the weighing portion of the receiving conveyor consists of a weighing con¬ veyor (1), whereby the receiving conveyor further comprises a battery (7) of wheels and a subsequent line conveyor (8).
3. A device according to claim 1, c h a r - a c t e r i z e d in that the weighing means (4) are positioned at least substantially at the place where the secondary wool mat (6) has reached its final thickness.
4. A device according to claim 2 or 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the weighing means 


(4) are positioned substantially at or at the outlet end of the weighing conveyor (1).
5. A device according to any of the claims 2 to 4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the weighing conveyor (1) is suspended in a mechanically balanced way, in order to minimize the effect of its own weight.
6. A device according to claim 5, c h a r¬ a c t e r i z e d in that cross springs (3) on each side of the weighing conveyor (1) form suspension devices.
7. A device according to claim 5 or 6, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the middle line (2a) of the swing motion of the suspended swing tray conveyor (2) lies between the suspension devices (3) of the weighing conveyor (1) and the outlet end of the weighing conveyor, preferably closer to the sus¬ pension devices (3) than to the outlet end.
