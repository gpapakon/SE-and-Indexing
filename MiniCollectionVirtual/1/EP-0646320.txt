<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow 
bodies with chocolate comprising a feeding unit (1) for conveying 

hollow bodies (A), a transport roller (2) positioned close 
to the feeding unit, a first transfer roller (5) positioned 

close to the transport roller, a chocolate filling roller (8) 
positioned close to the first transport roller, a second transfer 

roller (13) positioned close to the chocolate filling roller, 
and a discharging unit (14) positioned close to the second 

transfer roller for receiving and conveying hollow bodies filled 
with chocolate from the chocolate filling roller via the second 

transfer roller. The apparatus assures the continuous flow of 
hollow bodies to the chocolate filling station without any fear 

of breaking fragile hollow bodies, thereby permitting mass 
production of chocolate corn cakes, each filled with an exact 

amount of chocolate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for filling
edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies with chocolate. Such edible,
rod-shaped hollow bodies are prepared by baking or heating and
expanding grain.An apparatus for making cream cakes or cream puffs functions to
fill hollow pieces of light pastry with cream or jam one after
another, as disclosed in JP-A-56-64753(A) (Cream
Filler). It uses a conveyer equipped with a cream filler, which
conveyer can be changed for making a different kind of cream
cake or cream puff.Also, an apparatus for inserting rods into edible rod-shaped
bodies, such as sausages is disclosed in
JP-GM-5-14795(Y) (Rod-Inserting Apparatus).The cream filler has parts intermittently moving laterally and
longitudinally, and disadvantageously it requires a relatively
large floor space to occupy, and still disadvantageously,
synchronization of the lateral and longitudinal intermittent
moves in the cream filler is difficult to be attained.The rod-inserting apparatus cannot be applied to the filling of
edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies with chocolate.GB-A-1 489 155 discloses a food processing device to provide a coating
of a substance over the inner surface of a tubular food shell.The object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus
for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies with chocolate, not
requiring a large floor space to occupy, permitting the mass
production of chocolate-filled cakes with no fear of breaking
fragile edible enclosures, and assuring that edible enclosures
are filled with exact amount of chocolate.This object is solved with the features of claim 1.An apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped
hollow bodies with chocolate according to the present invention 
comprises: a feeding unit for conveying the edible, rod-shaped
hollow bodies; means for filling chocolate into the edible, rod-shaped
hollow bodies; a transport roller positioned close to the
feeding unit; a first transfer roller positioned close to the
transport roller; a chocolate filling roller positioned close to
the first transfer roller; a second transfer roller positioned
close to the chocolate filling roller; and a discharging unit
positioned close to the second transfer roller for receiving and
conveying edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies filled with chocolate
from the chocolate filling roller via the second transfer roller,
each of the transport roller, first transfer roller, chocolate
filling roller and second transfer roller having the same
recesses made at the same regular intervals on its
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies
with chocolate comprising:


a feeding unit (1) for conveying said edible, rod-shaped
hollow bodies (A); and means (11) for filling chocolate into the edible,

rod-shaped hollow bodies, characterized by a transport roller (2)
positioned close to

said feeding unit; a first transfer roller (5) positioned close
to said transport roller; a chocolate filling roller (8) positioned

close to said first transfer roller; a second transfer
roller (13) positioned close to said chocolate filling roller;

and a discharging unit (14) positioned close to said second
transfer roller for receiving and conveying edible, rod-shaped

hollow bodies filled with chocolate from said chocolate filling
roller via said second transfer roller,
each of said transport roller, first transfer roller,
chocolate filling roller and second transfer roller having the same

recesses (4) made at the same regular intervals on its circumference
for receiving said edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies, and being

adapted to rotate at one and the same circumference speed.
An apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies
with chocolate according to claim 1, wherein it further

comprises: a first guide means (6) extending along a predetermined
circumferential length of said transport roller (2)

upstream of the first contact point at which said transport roller
and said first transfer roller (5) meets; and a second guide

means (7) extending from the first contact point to the second
contact point at which said first transfer roller and said

chocolate filling roller (8) meets, along the lower, semicircular
circumference of said first transfer roller, thereby permitting

said edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies (A) to transfer
from said transport roller to said chocolate filling roller via

said first transfer roller.
An apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies
with chocolate according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said chocolate

filling roller (8) comprises first, second and third sub-rollers 
(8a), (8b) and (8c) rotating about one and same axle, said sub-rollers

being positioned close to said first and second transfer
rollers (5) and (13), said first sub-roller having the same recesses

(4) made at the same regular intervals as said first transfer roller,
and being adapted to rotate at the same circumference speed as

said first transfer roller, thereby receiving and bearing
edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies (A) from said first transfer

roller; said second sub-roller having the same recesses made at the same
regular intervals as said first sub-roller, and being adapted to

rotate and bring edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies to chocolate-filling
positions at which selected edible, rod-shaped hollow

bodies are put in alignment with a plurality of chocolate extruding
nozzles (11); and said third sub-roller having, in addition

to said chocolate extruding nozzles, a corresponding
plurality of piston-cylinder pumps (10) each allotted to each of

said chocolate extruding nozzles, and a chocolate vessel (15)
for supplying each of said piston-cylinder pumps with chocolate,

thus permitting said chocolate extruding nozzles to eject a
given amount of chocolate to each of said edible, rod-shaped

hollow bodies when brought to chocolate-filling positions.

guide means (7), extending from the second contact point at

which said first sub-roller (8a) and said first transfer roller
(5) meets to the downstream point of the circumference of said

first sub-roller at which downstream point there is no fear of
permitting edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies (A) to fall off; and

a fourth guide means relaying edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies,
and directing those filled with chocolate to said second transfer

roller (13).
An apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies
with chocolate according to claim 4, wherein said fourth guide

means includes: a feeding guide means (9a) climbing and extending
obliquely from the terminal point of the third guide means 

(9) to the point at which recesses of the circumference of the
second sub-roller (8b) appear sequentially; and a withdrawing

guide means (12) extending from the chocolate-ejection starting
point (17) to the chocolate-ejection ending point (18) on the

circumference of the second sub-roller, and extending obliquely
toward the circumference of the first sub-roller (8a); said

third sub-roller (8c) further having a plurality of three-way
valves each associated with each of said piston-cylinder pumps

(10) to communicate with said chocolate vessel (15); each of
said piston-cylinder pumps has a guide roll (20) fixed to its

piston (19), and said piston-cylinder pumps are adapted to be
operated by permitting their guide rolls to travel along a stationary

curved roll-pinch guide (21) encircling the third sub-roller.
An apparatus for filling edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies
with chocolate according to claim 5, wherein said third sub-roller

(8c) has upstream and downstream detectors (17) and (18)
for detecting arrival of edible, rod-shaped hollow bodies (A) at

the chocolate-ejection starting point and the chocolate-ejection
ending point, thereby opening and closing selected valves.
