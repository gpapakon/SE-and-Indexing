<ABSTRACT>
Brake drum for a vehicle brake, comprising a main portion (2) with a cylindrical inner 
frictional surface (5), a radial flange portion (4), on which the wheel rim is intended to 

be bolted, and a transitional portion (3) between the main portion and the flange portion. 
The thickness of the transitional portion is successively reduced from the main portion 

towards the flange portion in order be weak enough to be able to absorb deformation 
caused by a non-planar rim and prevent the deformation from being transferred to the 

main portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brake drum for a vehicle brake, comprising a main 
portion with a cylindrical inner frictional surface, a radial flange portion with bores for 
receiving fastener elements for a wheel rim and an essentially conical transitional portion 
connecting the main portion to the flange portion. Such a brake drum is known e.g. from document US-3 147 828. Brake drums of this type are used i.a. in drum brakes for heavy trucks. A number of 
different designs are known, most of which have in common that, depending on the 
circumstances, during braking they produce so-called braking vibrations.These 
disturbances are usually in the form of cab and/or steering wheel vibrations and can be 
quite troublesome to the driver. The problem of eliminating these vibrations has proved 
to be very difficult to solve. In a known brake drum of the type described by way of introduction, which at times can 
produce such braking vibrations, the transitional portion between the main portion and 
the flange portion has approximately the same thickness along its entire axial extent. Its 
outer surfaces has a first inwardly inclined portion with a straight longitudinal profile 
going into the flange portion via a second inwardly inclined portion, also with an essentially 
straight longitudinal profile. The inner surface of the transitional portion consists of 
a first and a second cylindrical surface with an intermediate step. The purpose of the present invention is to modify this known brake drum just described, 
so that the risk of braking vibrations will be eliminated or in any case be substantially 
reduced. This is achieved according to the invention by virtue of the fact that the transitional 
portion has a first portion extending from the main portion and having converging inner 
and outer profiles, said transitional portion passing into the radial flange portion via a 
second portion with longitudinally outwardly curved outer and inner profiles, said transitional 
portion having a smallest thickness in said second portion. The invention is based on theoretical studies and tests carried out, which have verified 
that the slight oval shape of the main portion of the brake drum which can arise when  
 
the drum is deformed when a non-planar or dirty wheel rim is mounted, is one of the 
parameters which can contribute to brake vibrations arising in the contact between the 
frictional surface of the brake drum and the brake shoes. By making the brake drum in 
the manner described above it has been
