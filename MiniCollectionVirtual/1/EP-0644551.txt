<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sense amplifier, and
more particularly to a sense amplifier which is used in
a semiconductor memory device and has a function of
amplifying a signal flowing in a bit line and
transmitting the amplified signal to a data line.At present, in a typical dynamic semiconductor
memory device, paired bit lines are connected to a
memory cell and a potential difference between the
paired bit lines is amplified by a sense amplifier so as
to amplify a signal flowing in the bit line.The sense amplifier includes a sense circuit for
sensing and amplifying a potential difference between
the paired bit lines. As the sense amplifier, a sense
amplifier having two transistors cross-coupled between
the paired bit lines is generally used.Further, bit line pairs of a number corresponding
to a preset number of columns are provided. When data
is read out from a memory cell or data is written into a
memory cell, a desired bit line pair is selected from a
plurality of bit line pairs by a column selection signal
output from a column decoder. A column gate is provided
between the bit line pair and the data line pair to
electrically connect or disconnect the bit line pair to
or from the data line pair according to the column
selection signal.FIG. 1 is a general circuit diagram of this type of 
circuit (see Figure 1 of US-A-4949306).
In FIG. 1, one column (one bit line pair) is shown.As shown in FIG. 1, a bit line BL and an inverted
bit line BBL (in this specification, the head symbol "B"
indicates an inverted signal) which makes a pair with
the bit line BL are provided to make a bit line pair in
a semiconductor memory device.A sense amplifier circuit 4 is connected between
the paired bit lines BL and BBL and is constructed by
N-channel MOSFETs (which are hereinafter referred to as
NMOSs) Q1 and Q2 and P-channel MOSFETs (which are
hereinafter referred to as PMOSs) Q5 and Q6.The source of the NMOS Q1 is connected to an
inverted sense signal line BSAN, the drain thereof is
connected to the bit line BL, and the gate thereof is
connected to the inverted bit line BBL. The source of
the NMOS Q2 is connected to the inverted sense signal
line BSAN, the drain thereof is connected to the
inverted bit line BBL, and the gate thereof is connected
to the bit line BL. The source of the PMOS Q5 is connected
to a sense signal line SAN, the drain thereof is
connected to the bit line BL, and the gate thereof is
connected to the inverted bit line BBL. The source of
the PMOS Q6 is connected to the sense signal line BSAN,
