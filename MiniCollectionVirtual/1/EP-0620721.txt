<ABSTRACT>
A prefabricated inlay (1) for restoring a tooth by application and fixation in a cavity prepared in the tooth and having essentially the same shape as the inlay part adapted for insertion, is provided with a pin (6) which projects from the inlay part not adapted for insertion and which is arranged to be received in an inlay holder. The whole inlay (1) is made of a material translucent to light that is suitable for curing a light-curing material used for fixing the inlay in the cavity. The inlay holder has a light source and a light guide having a tip (18) with a recess (19) for receiving the pin (6) of the inlay (1), such that the light generated by the light source can be guided through the light guide and the inlay (1) to the light-curing material. A tooth restoration set comprises a plurality of prefabricated frustoconical inlays (1), preferably having the same cone angle as well as several different narrow-end diameters, and a plurality of frustoconical burrs having the same cone angle as the inlays (1) as well as corresponding different narrow-end diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally, the present invention relates to tooth
restoration.More precisely, the invention concerns a prefabricated
inlay for restoring a tooth by application and
fixation in a cavity prepared in the tooth and having
essentially the same shape as the inlay part adapted for
insertion.The invention also bears upon an inlay holder for the
application of a prefabricated inlay in a cavity prepared
in a tooth and having essentially the same shape as the
inlay part adapted for insertion.Finally, the invention relates to a tooth restoration
set for implementing the method.Tooth restorations can be divided into indirect and
direct restorations. In indirect restorations, an impression
of a prepared cavity is made and employed for producing
an inlay of e.g. porcelain or gold. Such restorations
have, inter alia, the disadvantage of being time-consuming,
and thus necessitate at least two visits to the dentist.
Also, these restorations, which are fairly expensive,
require the use of a temporary filling while the
final inlay is being produced.In direct restorations, use is commonly made of amalgam
or composite materials. The composite materials have
been developed to replace amalgam, but they are not suitable
for large fillings, since they shrink when cured,
have a relatively low abrasion resistance and strength,
and involve the risk of gaps arising in the interface
between the filling and the tooth. Prefabricated inlays, preferably of ceramic material,
have been developed as a further alternative to amalgam
fillings. By using prefabricated inlays, a prepared cavity
can be filled more or less completely with the inlay which
is fixed therein, e.g. by a composite material. With this
technique, the effect of the shrinkage of the composite
material is considerably reduced. However, a certain risk
of gap formation remains, unless the inlay covers the
entire cavity opening. This also goes for the abrasion
risk. Further, prior-art techniques for applying and fixing
a prefabricated inlay in a cavity are imperfect, in
that they do not enable accurate positioning and rapid
fixation of the inlay in the cavity.The object of the present invention is, therefore,
to provide an improved prefabricated inlay, as well as an
improved apparatus for applying and fixing such an inlay
in a prepared cavity.According to the invention, this object is achieved
by a prefabricated inlay which is of the type mentioned by
way of introduction, and which is characterised in that it
has a pin which projects from the inlay part not adapted
for

<CLAIMS>
A prefabricated inlay for restoring a tooth by
application and fixation in a cavity prepared in the tooth

and having essentially the same shape as the inlay part
adapted for insertion, 
characterised
 in that
it has a pin (6; 14) which projects from the inlay part

not adapted for insertion and which is arranged to be
received in an inlay holder (15), and that the whole inlay

(1; 11) is made of a material translucent to light that is
suitable for curing a light-curing material used for fixing

the inlay in the cavity.
An inlay as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised

in that the pin (6; 14) has a round cross-sectional
shape for fixation in a corresponding recess

(19) in the inlay holder (15).
An inlay as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised

in that the inlay (1) is at least
partly cylindrical or at least partly conical.
An inlay as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised

in that the inlay (1) is entirely conical
at least in the part adapted to fill the cavity opening.
An inlay as claimed in any one of claims 1-4,

characterised
 in that it is made of a ceramic
or glass-ceramic material.
An inlay as claimed in any one of claims 1-5,

characterised
 in that the inlay part adapted
for insertion (e.g. 4) is provided with raised portions

and/or depressions (5) to improve mechanical retention.
An inlay as claimed in any one of claims 1-6,

characterised
 in that it is pre-etched.
An inlay holder for the application of a prefabricated
inlay (1; 11) in a cavity prepared in a tooth and

having essentially the same shape as the inlay part adapted 
for insertion, 
characterised
 by a light
source (16) for generating light suitable for curing a

light-curing material for fixing the inlay (1) in the
cavity, and a light guide (17) receiving the light from

the light source and having a tip (18) with a recess (19)
adapted to receive a pin (6; 14) which projects from the

inlay part not adapted for insertion, such that the light
generated by the light source (16) can be guided through

the light guide (17) and the inlay (1; 11) to the light-curing
material.
An inlay holder as claimed in claim 8, 
characterised

in that the recess (19) has a round
cross-sectional shape.
An inlay holder as claimed in claim 8 or 9,

characterised
 in that the light source (16)
generates blue light in the wave range of 400-500 nm.
