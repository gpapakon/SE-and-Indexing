<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the weight of known jacks, articulations are used for the rotatable connection of supporting parts on jacks to pivots rolling in bores (18), the supporting parts being profiles of U-shaped cross-section with lateral profile legs (15) or components with laterally turned up sheet-metal tabs (13) which overlap in the area of the articulations. Hollow journals (19) necked out of the profile legs (15) or sheet-metal tabs (13) are provided as pivots which engage in the bores (18) of the opposite part.

<CLAIMS>
Articulation between load-bearing parts of vehicle jacks, which load-bearing parts are
connected in such a manner as to be able to rotate, comprise profiles which have a U-shaped

cross-section and comprise profiled side limbs (15, 17), with components
having upright metal side plates (13) or upright side metal sheets which are connected

elsewhere, which are provided with hollow spigots (19) which neck outwards from the
profiled limbs (15, 17), sheet metal plates (13) or metal sheets and engage into holes

(18) of the counter piece, characterized in that the holes (18) are disposed in each case
in the respective outer-lying profiled limbs (15) or sheet metal plates (13) and the ends

(20) of the hollow spigot (19) which protrude beyond the holes (18) widen with
respect to the diameter of the holes (18).
Articulation according to claim 1, characterized in that the widened region of the
hollow spigot ends (20) is produced by flanging.
Articulation according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that the holes (18) are
also outwardly necked in a cylindrical manner at least over a short length.
Articulation according to one or several of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a
bushing is disposed between the hole (18) and the hollow spigot (19).
