<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum CVD chambers are disclosed which provide a more 
uniformly deposited thin film on a substrate (14). The 

chamber susceptor mount (210) for the substrate (14) is 
heated resistively with a single coil firmly contacting the 

metal of the susceptor on all sides, providing uniform 
temperatures across the susceptor mount (210) for a 

substrate (14). A purge gas line (222) is connected to 
openings in the susceptor outside of the periphery of the 

substrate (14) to prevent edge and backside contamination 
of the substrate (14). A vacuum feed line mounts the 

substrate to the susceptor (210) during processing. A 
refractory purge guide (226), or a plurality of placement 

pins, maintain a fixed gap passage for the purge gases to 
pass alongside the edge of the wafer (14) and into the 

processing area of the chamber. An exhaust pumping plate 
improves the uniformity of exhaustion of spent gases from 

the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) chamber. More particularly, this invention
relates to a CVD vacuum chamber which deposits thin films more
uniformly onto a semiconductor substrate.CVD vacuum chambers are employed to deposit thin films on
semiconductor substrates. A precursor gas is charged to a
vacuum chamber through a gas manifold plate situate above the
substrate, which substrate is heated to process temperatures,
generally in the range of about 250-650°C. The precursor gas
reacts on the heated substrate surface to deposit a thin layer
thereon and to form volatile by-product gases, which are pumped
away through the chamber exhaust system.To increase manufacturing efficiency and device
capabilities, the size of devices formed on a substrate has
decreased, and the number of devices formed on a substrate has
increased in recent year.Thus it is increasingly important that
CVD deposited thin films be of uniform thickness across the
substrate, so that all of the devices on the substrate are
uniform. Further, it is increasingly important that the
generation of particles in processing chambers be avoided to
reduce contamination of substrates that will reduce the yield
of good devices.Further, the size of semiconductor substrates, e.g.,
silicon wafers, has increased so that the present state-of-the-art 
silicon wafers are about 20.32 cm (8 inches) in diameter. This makes
it feasible to process only one wafer at a time in a processing
chamber, as opposed to batch-type processes that process a
plurality, up to 100 wafers, at a time. The economies of batch
processing are reduced using large wafers because if there is a
problem during processing, many expensive wafers are damaged
and must be discarded. Further, the processing chambers can be
made smaller when only one substrate is to be processed at a
time, and the processing is more controllable.Still further, equipment has been developed to automate
wafer processing by performing several sequences of processing
steps without removing the wafer from a vacuum environment,
thereby reducing transfer times and contamination of wafers.
Such a system has been disclosed for example by Maydan et al,
US - A - 4,951,601, in which a plurality of processing
chambers are connected to a transfer chamber. A robot in a
central transfer chamber passes wafers through slit valves in
the various connected processing chambers and retrieves them
after processing in the chambers is complete.A typical prior art CVD chamber is disclosed in Fig. 1.
