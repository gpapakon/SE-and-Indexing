<ABSTRACT>
A positive working deep UV sensitive photoresist which 
provides improved critical dimension stability during prolonged 

periods of post exposure delay before baking comprises an acid 
stable polymer which is insoluble in water but normally soluble 

in an aqueous alkaline medium, a photo acid generator exemplified 
by the tri-(2,1,4-diazonaphthoquinonesulfonate) ester of 3,5-dinitro-2,6-dimethylol 

para cresol, and a mixed carbonate ester 
of tertiary butyl alcohol and a polyhydric phenol which is an 

acid labile compound which inhibits the dissolution of the 
normally soluble polymer in said alkaline medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a deep ultra-violet radiation 
sensitive composition which contains a polymeric binder which is 
insoluble in water but normally soluble in aqueous alkaline 
media, an acid labile organic compound which inhibits the 
dissolution of the binder in aqueous alkaline but which 
decomposes in contact with an acid, and a novel photo acid 
generator which chemically amplifies the sensitivity of the 
composition upon exposure to actinic radiation. The composition 
is particularly suitable as a positive working photoresist 
wherein the exposed portions are rendered soluble or developable 
by deep UV radiation and can be removed with selective developing 
solutions while the unexposed portions remain intact. Thus 
imagewise exposure of the composition and development yields an 
image corresponding to the original image. The sensitivity of photolithographic systems based on 
diazonaphthoquinone sensitized novolac resins is limited by the 
quantum efficiency of the sensitizer to photoproduct conversion. 
It is too low for practical use in deep UV work because of the 
very low power that is available from exposure sources in those 
wavelengths. A dramatic increase in sensitivity in radiation-sensitive 
systems, often referred as chemical amplification, is 
obtained when a species produced in the primary photoreaction 
independently initiates a catalytic secondary reaction, thus 
increasing the quantum yield to values'above one. For example, 
systems which photochemically produce a strong acid which then 
cleaves acid labile groups in a secondary reaction are disclosed  
 
in US-A-3,915,706 for positive working polyaldehydes. Radiation sensitive mixtures which contain, as a binder, a 
polymer which is soluble in aqueous alkaline media, a compound 
which forms a strong acid by a photochemical reaction, and 
another compound which possesses acid cleavable C-O-C bonds and 
whose solubility in a liquid developer is increased by the action 
of acid are disclosed in US-A-4,678,737. Photosolubilizable compositions which are readily removable 
by developing solutions in areas exposed to actinic radiation are 
taught in US-A-3,779,778. That composition comprises 
a water-insoluble organic compound containing one or more acid 
degradable linkages of the general formula 
 
wherein Z may be -OAr, among others, and a photolyzable acid 
progenitor which upon exposure to actinic radiation generates an 
acidic condition. US-A-4,311,782 shows a radiation sensitive 
mixture which contains an acid forming
