<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a protective sleeve for a windscreen wiper blade (1) including claws (12) for holding the wiper lip (2), the said protective sheath (13) having a tubular shape, the cross-section of which is substantially in the shape of a "V" and which exhibits two divergent longitudinal wings (14, 15) equipped with claws (17, 18) designed to interact with lateral grooves (5, 6) provided on the blade element (1) of the windscreen wiper blade, characterised in that at least the upper part of the sheath (13) bearing the longitudinal claws (17, 18) is made of a rigid material, and in that the said wings (14, 15) are extended by fingers (21, 22) stretching substantially parallel to the mid-plane symmetry (27) of the protective sheath, the said fingers (21, 22) being located on the side of the protective sheath so as to cover over the claws (12) which hold on the blade element (2).
