<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet textile
printing ink suitable for use in conducting textile
printing, in particular, on woven or nonwoven fabrics of
cotton, silk or the like, which are dyeable with reactive
dyes and composed principally of cellulose fibers and/or
polyamide fibers, or mixed woven or nonwoven fabrics
composed of these fibers and other fibers, and
an instrument making use of the ink.At present, textile printing is principally
conducted by screen printing or roller printing. Both
methods are unfit for multi-kind small-quantity production
and difficult to quickly cope with the fashion of the day.
Therefore, there has recently been a demand for
development of an electronic printing system making no use
of any plate.In compliance with this demand, many textile
printing processes according to ink-jet recording have
been proposed. Various fields expect much from such
textile printing processes.Ink-jet textile printing inks are required to have 
the following performance characteristics:
(1) being able to develop the color of ink to a
sufficient color depth;(2) causing no clogging in an ejection orifice;(3) being able to quickly dry on cloth;(4) undergoing little irregular feathering on cloth;(5) undergoing no changes in physical properties and
ejection properties and depositing no solid matter in the
course of storage; and(6) undergoing no change in ejection properties even
in a long-time ejection durability test, and causing
neither disconnection nor deposition of foreign matter on
a heating head, in particular, in a case of textile
printing by a system making use of thermal energy.In order to satisfy these performance
characteristics required, the following means have
heretofore been proposed.First, in order to cope with the requirement (1), it
has been generally conducted to make the concentration of a
dye high, to obtain the sufficient color depth. This method
is an essential means for using ink droplets as minute as 200
pl or less, or conducting textile printing on a cloth high in
absorbing power. However, such an ink finally causes the
problem as to the requirement (2) because of thickening of
the ink and deposition of the dye as solid matter due to
evaporation of water in the ink from the tip of a nozzle. It has therefore been conducted to add a polyhydric
alcohol such as glycerol to an ink in order to cope with
the requirement (2). However, this means is not useful if
the concentration of a dye contained in the ink exceeds
5 %, and hence does not give a satisfactory result

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printing ink for a cloth including
cellulose fibers and/or polyamide fibers comprising a

reactive dye, an aqueous liquid medium and at least one
substance selected from the group consisting of

tricarboxylic acids and alkali metal salts thereof in a
content range of from 0.01 to 10 % by weight based on the

total weight of the ink, and the ink having a pH of from 4
to 9.
The ink-jet printing ink according to claim 1, wherein
the total content of said at least one substance selected

from the group consisting of the tricarboxylic acids and
alkali metal salts thereof is within a range of from 0.02

to 5 % by weight based on the total weight of the ink.
The ink-jet printing ink according to claim 1, wherein
the tricarboxylic acid and/or the alkali metal salt thereof

is at least one substance selected from the group
consisting of citric acid and alkali metal salts thereof.
The ink-jet printing ink according to claim 1, wherein
the reactive dye has a vinylsulfone group and/or a

monochlorotriazine group.
