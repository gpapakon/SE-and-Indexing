<ABSTRACT>
An automatic greasing system for a pin-connected part and a bearing for a swingable shaft of a work machine of a construction 
machine, especially, a hydraulic excavating machine, having many parts to be greased at short grease supply intervals. 

When an operation time of the part to be greased, such as a pin-connected portion and a bearing for a swingable shaft of the 
work machine, or a total of the operation time and short non-operation time regarded as an operation time reaches a predetermined 

greasing interval time, greasing is automatically carried out and automatically stopped upon completion thereof. This enables 

the labor saving in greasing which otherwise takes an operator a great number of manhours, and also prevents the outflow 
of excessive grease from each part of the machine to be greased from soiling the surroundings of an excavating machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention particularly relates to an 
automatic greasing system and an abnormality detecting 
method therefor for construction machines such as a 
hydraulic excavating machine which is equipped with earth 
working tools such as arm members and a bucket, which 
comprise a work machine mounted on an upper swivel body of 
the excavating machine and are articulation-connected, to 
carry out earth moving work such as excavation by swinging 
these working members with hydraulic cylinders which are 
pin-connected between the arm members and earth working 
tools. Currently, those parts of construction machines such 
as hydraulic excavating machines for which greasing is 
required, that is, those pin-connected parts of earth 
working tools such as arm members and a bucket are directly 
greased by an operator with a grease gun through the end 
faces of pins or the bushes and bosses into which the pins 
are inserted. Otherwise, some of construction machines are 
provided with a centralized greasing port for greasing 
several pin connections to supply grease to these pin-connected  
 
parts. In the case of conventional greasing with 
the grease gun according to the related art, the operator 
should go around to reach the greasing portions of the 
machine since the greasing portions are dispersedly located 
and therefore it is troublesome for the operator to finish 
such greasing service. In such way of greasing according 
to the related art, an outfit of the operator maybe 
tainted with grease since greasing is directly performed by 
the operator with the grease gun. In addition, 
construction machines which handle earth and sand which are 
undesirable to the machines and should therefore be 
periodically greased at a greasing interval specified by a 
manufacturer are always confronted with fears as regarding 
seizure of pins and bushes, production of loud sound or 
noisy rattling sound due to an increase of clearance 
between pins and bushes resulting from wear, deterioration 
of durability due to development of wear caused by mud and 
sand which have entered into the pin-connected parts if the 
specified greasing interval is ignored. Recently, an 
automatic greasing system for construction machines 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.190837-1989) as 
shown in Fig. 12 has also been invented. In Fig. 12, a 
grease pump 38 connected to a pressure-accumulated grease 
tank 44 is provided on an upper swivel body 5 of a 
hydraulic excavating machine 1, a discharging port of the 
grease pump 38 is
