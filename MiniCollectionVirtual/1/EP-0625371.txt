<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a thermally shock resistant 
washcoated substrate involves introducing a buffer solution 

into the microcracks, and optionally the micropores of a 
porous sintered body, the pH of the buffer solution being at 

a predetermined value to result in the formation of a gel on 
contact of the buffer solution with the slurry which is to 

be subsequently applied, contacting the body with a 
washcoating slurry to form a gel at the interface of the
 
buffer solution and slurry. Formation of the gel prevents 

the slurry from entering the microcracks. The body is then 
calcined at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form 

the washcoated substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for improving the
thermal shock resistance of bodies in their application as
washcoated substrates for catalysts.Ceramic honeycombs are widely used as catalytic
substrates in automotive, woodstove, and other catalytic
applications. The low thermal expansion of these
honeycombs makes them excellent thermally shock resistant
substrates for high temperature applications.Generally, thermal shock resistance of a coated
substrate is lower than that of a bare ceramic substrate.
The thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of cordierite
honeycombs is known to be raised by alumina washcoats,
resulting in a significant reduction in thermal shock
resistance. It is widely assumed that one of the causes
for the increase in CTE is due to penetration of washcoat
particles and/or dissolved species into microcracks in the
substrate, or precipitation of dissolved material on
drying, the size of the penetrating material being
generally smaller than the size of the microcracks. Thus,
it is essential to block the microcracks during
washcoating in order to preserve a high degree of thermal
shock resistance.U.S. patents 4,451,517; 4,483,940 and 4,532,228
describe the use of various precoats to reduce the effect
of washcoats on CTE, and to improve thermal shock
resistance. DE-A-0 444 495 relates to a method of producing monolithic
catalysts with improved thermal shock qualities by introducing
an organic filling agent which can be melted, burned out, and
is insoluble in water, into the microcracks of a catalyst
carrier. The structure is then dried and the filling agent is
burned out. There remains a need to improve or preserve the
thermal shock resistance of washcoated ceramic bodies,
especially honeycombs.We found that this object is achieved by the method
of claim 1, involving selective treatment of microcracks
in the substrate so as to prevent penetration of a high
surface area oxide containing catalyst washcoat slurry
during its application to the substrate.Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the surface of a
body to be washcoated by the method of the present
invention, showing the micropores and microcracks.Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing microcrack and
part of the micropore filled with the buffer solution.Figure 3 is a schematic diagram showing a microcrack
terminating in a micropore with part of the micropore
filled with gel and the microcrack filled with buffer
solution.Figure 4 is a plot of Delta L/L in ppm versus
