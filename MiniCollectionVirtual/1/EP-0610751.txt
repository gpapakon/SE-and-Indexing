<ABSTRACT>
In mass transfer columns, in particular in distillation and extraction columns, fluidized-bed contacting elements (solids) are frequently used to improve the mass transfer. A considerable increase in the mass transfer rate can be achieved if asymmetrically shaped fluidized-bed contacting elements (E) are used which are characterised in that their geometric centre (M) does not coincide with the centre of gravity (S), the geometric centre (M) being defined as the intersection of the body diagonals of the smallest possible parallelepiped (Q) completely enclosing the fluid element. Typical examples of such shapes are egg-shaped or drop-shaped bodies. By means of such fluidized-bed contacting elements, in addition to improving the mass transfer, a reduction of the specific pressure drop can also be achieved.

A process for mass transfer in a mass transfer column
packed with freely movable fluidized bed contact

elements, in which a gaseous phase is brought into
contact with a liquid phase, characterised in that the

rate of mass transfer in the column is increased by
the use of asymmetrically egg-shaped or droplet-shaped

fluidised bed contact elements which, within the
fluidised bed, are permanently in rotation about a

plurality of volume axes of inertia and the asymmetry
of which lies in the fact that the geometric centre

point, defined as the point of the intersection of the
body diagonals of the smallest possible rectangular

parallelepiped enveloping the fluidised bed contact
element, does not coincide with the centre of mass of

the fluidised bed contact element.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that,
due to the use of the egg-shaped fluidised bed contact

elements, the gas loading capacity is also increased
and/or the specific pressure drops in the column are

reduced.
A process according to claim 1 to 2, characterised in
that hollow, asymmetrical fluidised bed contact

elements made of plastic are used.
