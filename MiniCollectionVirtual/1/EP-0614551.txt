<ABSTRACT>
The control of the interaction between a server interface and an application is integrated into the application itself in the state of the art. Changes in interaction control therefore require program adaptations that are difficult to survey. In order to avoid that, the interaction is controlled by a process that is independent from the actual implementation of the application and that derives the information required for control purposes from an object-oriented description of the application.

<CLAIMS>
Method for controlling the interaction of an
user interface with an operator application, according

to which

a) operator guidance information relating to the
operator application is formed on the basis of a

requirement by the user interface,
b) once it has been formed, the operator guidance
information is transferred to the user interface

for the purpose of display,
c) the structure of an operator application is
described with the aid of object-oriented formalism,

characterized in that

d) the operator guidance information is derived from
the said formalism with the aid of an interpreter

(TR) which is contained in the operator application.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the said formalism is also used to
define conditions relating to the attributes of an

operable object, and only those operator guidance information
items which describe attributes whose values

satisfy the defined conditions are formed and transferred
to the user interface.
Method according to Claim 2,

characterized in that the said conditions are predetermined
by a specific operator application.
Method according to Claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that the said conditions are predetermined
by the system.
Operator interface for controlling the interaction of 
an user interface with an operator application, which


a) forms operator guidance information relating to the
operator application on the basis of a requirement

by the user interface,
b) once it has been formed, transfers the operator
guidance information to the user interface for

the purpose of graphic display,

characterized in that

c) the operator interface derives the operator guidance
information from the structure description (which is

implemented with the aid of object-oriented
formalism) of the operator application with the aid

of an interpreter (TR) which is included in the
operator application.
Operator interface according to Claim 5,

characterized in that

a) conditions relating to the attributes of an operable
object can also be defined by the said object-oriented

formalism,
b) the operator interface comprises an inference mechanism
(IM) which verifies those conditions which are

defined with the aid of the object-oriented
formalism and, after each interaction step, transfers

the result of the verification to the
interpreter,
c) the interpreter transfers operator guidance
information items relating to the conditioned

attributes to the user interface only if the
result of the said verification was positive.
