<ABSTRACT>
A sports shoe comprises a shoe body (2) having a sole 
(1), and an insole (3). The insole (3) is laid on the sole 

(1) within the shoe body (2). Heel-side part (3a) of the 
insole (3) is thicker than toe-side part (3b) thereof. A 

side fitting member (4) is provided on heel-side upper part 
of a side wall (2a) of the shoe body (2), while a sole 

fitting member (5), which is hollowed in a curved surface 
shape, is provided on heel-side part of the insole (3). 

The shoe does not show its heel-side part being raised in 
appearance. The sole (1) and the insole (3) provide double-cushion 

effect and lessen impact during exercise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvement of sports shoes 
with raised heel part. Generally a shoe comprises a bottom, an insole, and an 
upper. The bottom includes a sole portion and a heel 
portion. Here in this specification, the upper implies 
part covering around the heel side of a wearer's foot as 
well as the instep, and the part covering around the heel 
side is described as a side wall. A type of sports shoes in 
which the bottom (i.e. the sole portion and the heel 
portion) is of one single body, and heel-side part of the 
bottom is simply raised higher or thicker than toe-side part 
thereof, is known. An insole of this type of shoes is flat. 
Heel-side part of a side wall is thickened by lining with 
shoe material to keep its original shape. Here sports 
shoes include various types of shoes, such as jogging shoes, 
running shoes, flat shoes, training shoes, tennis shoes, 
basketball shoes, sneakers and the like. Known sports shoes mentioned above, however, 
apparently show that heel-side parts are raised and 
heightened, and do not look neat or fancy. Also since the 
heel portion and the sole portion are formed into one, there  
 
is only one single cushion element, thereby resulting in 
less cushioning. Furthermore, an insole face and a side wall 
of such a sports shoe do not fit a sole and a side 
(including a heel) of a wearer's foot. As a result, such a 
shoe is liable to slip off from a wearer's foot. It is an object of the present invention, therefore, 
to provide shoes that reduce solve of the problems existing in said 
known sports shoes. In order to achieve the object, a sports shoe of the 
present invention includes a shoe body 2 having a sole 1, 
and an insole 3 which is provided on the sole 1 within the 
shoe body 2, heel-side part 3a of the insole 3 being thicker 
than toe-side part 3b thereof. A side fitting member 4 may be 
provided on heel-side upper part of a side wall 2a of the 
shoe body 2. Furthermore, the insole 3 preferably comprises a sole 
fitting member 5 which is hollowed in a curved surface to 
snugly receive a wearer's foot, especially heel-side part 
of the foot. The shoes of the present invention are made according 
to the above described, therefore, they may not show in 
appearance that the heel-side parts are raised or 
heightened. Adding the insole 3 within the shoe body 2, 
the shoe has two cushion elements, i.e. the sole and the 
insole laid on top of the sole. Providing the side fitting 
member 4 and the sole fitting member 5, the shoe snugly 
fits the side and
