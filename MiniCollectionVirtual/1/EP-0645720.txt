<ABSTRACT>
A dictionary creation supporting system capable of 
improving the efficiency of the dictionary creation process 

for the dictionary such as the user dictionary. In the 
system, a first language document and a corresponding 

second language document are entered, and each first 
language character string to be registered in the 

dictionary is extracted from the first language document. 
Then, each corresponding second language character string 

with respect to each first language character string is 
selectively extracted from the corresponding second 

language document according to a level of correspondence 
between a section of the first language document from which 

each first language character string is extracted and a 
section of the corresponding second language document to 

which each corresponding second language character string 
belongs, and each first language character string and each 

corresponding second language character string are 
selectively outputted as a candidate for a registration 

knowledge to be registered in the dictionary according to 
the level of correspondence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dictionary creation
supporting system for supporting the creation of the
dictionary to be used in the natural language processing
system such as a machine translation system.In recent years, the machine translation system for
automatically translating the sentences in the first
language in the sentences in the second language by
utilizing a computer has been attracting much attention. In
the machine translation system, in principle, the input
original sentence is segmented into prescribed processing
units such as words or phrases by applying the
morphological analysis and the syntactic analysis. Then,
for each processing unit, the applicable translation rules
and the corresponding translation word or phrase are
determined by the searching through the translation
dictionary. Finally, the translation sentence is obtained
by joining the determined translation words or phrases
according to the prescribed translation sentence generation
rules.In general, such a machine translation system is
provided with a user registration dictionary (user
dictionary) and a user rule dictionary, in order to assist
the effective use of the system by an individual user
having a variety of individual demands and tastes. These
dictionaries are usually given a higher priority over the
standard dictionary in selecting the translation word or in
applying the translation rule, such that the desired 
translation words can be outputted for the expressions
unique to each user or document.In a case of creating this type of dictionary for
customization purpose such as the user dictionary or the
user rule dictionary, a conventional procedure has been to
make a collective registration of the dictionary
registration data according to the bilingual translation
list prepared by the user in advance, by utilizing either
the user registration function provided in the system, or
the interactively operated dictionary editing system.In such a conventional procedure, however, when the
terminology list is not prepared in advance, there is a
need to carry out a tedious task of extracting the
bilingual translation list from the already existing
documents, and this task has been a very heavy burden on
the user at a time of the dictionary creation.Thus, conventionally, even though a tool for
inputting and editing the user dictionary or the user rule
dictionary has been available, there still remains a
problem concerning the difficulty of the task for
collecting the user dictionary information or the user rule
informatio

selectively extracting step (4, 8) extracts (4) each

document from which each first language character string

is extracted. 
The method of claim 4, wherein the selectively extracting
step (4, 8) extracts each corresponding second language

constituent words of each first language character string
are arranged in the first language.

step (4, 8) extracts each corresponding second language

character string from each section of the corresponding
