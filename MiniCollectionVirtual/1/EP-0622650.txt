<ABSTRACT>
A Mach-Zehnder filter includes an input coupler (20) for 
splitting an input signal into N equal output signals, 

where N
>
2, and a signal combining coupler (28) for combining N 
optical signals into a single output signal. It further 

includes N optical waveguide fibers (22,23,24) for connecting the N 
outputs from the input coupler to the signal combining 

coupler. Each of the N optical fibers subjects the light 
propagating therethrough to a delay (25,26,27) that is different from 

the delay experienced by light propagating through each of 
the other optical fibers. This Mach-Zehnder filter 

exhibits greater finesse per stage than previous Mach-Zehnder 
devices, finesse being the ratio of the wavelength 

separation between adjacent peaks to the peak widths. 
This can be achieved by employing optical fibers of different lengths, 

by employing optical fibers of identical lengths but having different 
refractive index profiles, 
or by inserting optical delay devices in at 
least two of the fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Mach-Zehnder filters
with narrow peaks and wide separation between peaks.There is an emerging need for narrowband filters.
Such devices are needed in the 1550 nm window for modifying
the gain spectrum of erbium fiber amplifiers. They will
also be widely used in trunk lines as well as in fiber-to-the-subscriber
architectures.There is a need for both wavelength tunable components
and fixed wavelength components. In an all optical
network, for example, the device can be tuned at the
receiver end in order to detect the desired incoming
signal. In a second approach, tunable lasers are used to
send a plurality of signals, and the desired signal is
detected by employing a receiver having a fixed filter.
The transmission system could also employ both fixed lasers
and filters. The wavelength separation capabilities of
such filters needs to be on the order of tens of nanometers
to as small as a nanometer. Moreover, these components
will need to be environmentally stable and very reliable.The Mach-Zehnder filter is known for its narrowband
wavelength capabilities. It has been proposed that filters
having pass bands as narrow as 1 nm be formed by connecting
two evanescent couplers with unequal fiber lengths between
them. See OFC Conference on Optical Fiber Communication,
Minitutorial Sessions, January 22-26, 1990, page 256 (part
of a presentation on "Dense WDM Techniques" by C. A.
Brackett), and P.E. Green, Fiber Optic Networks, Prentice 
Hall, 1993, pp. 123.Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a conventional
Mach-Zehnder filter. Two couplers C1 and C2 are
concatenated by optical waveguide paths or fibers F1 and F2.
For the sake of simplicity, optical fibers will usually be
discussed. The couplers for this conventional Mach-Zehnder
device, which are typically evanescent type couplers, are
usually 3 dB couplers, whereby the optical power that is
applied to input port 2, for example, is equally divided
between the two outputs of coupler C1. Mach-Zehnder devices
can also employ non-evanescent planar couplers; see S.I.
Najafi, Introduction to Glass Integrated Optics, Artech
House, 1992, pp. 156-160. For certain types of filters,
one or more of the couplers can unequally split the input
power. One of the fibers has means OPLD to impart to it an
optical path length difference so that there is a phase
shift between the two input signals that are applied to
coupler C2. A phase shift can be induced by employing
fibers having different lengths or different refractive
index profiles, or by
