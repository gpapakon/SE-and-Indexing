<ABSTRACT>
[Object]
A continuous heat treating machine for synthetic fiber 
tow provides a method for maintaining pressure having 

excellent stability on maintaining the pressure inside of 
the pressure chamber while avoiding quality deterioration 

and while ensuring the minimum leakage of steam for heating 
medium. 
[Structure]
The length and breadth dimensions of the exit pressure 
seal part are set to narrower than those of the entrance 

pressure seal part. 
[Effects]
The method ensures the minimum damage on heat treating 
fiber, gives minimum unit requirement of steam for heating 

medium, and offers a stable operation and uniform heat 
treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for maintaining 
pressure in a continuous heat treating machine for synthetic 
fiber tow. As a known important process of synthetic fiber 
production, a synthetic fiber tow which was imparted with 
false crimps by a crimping machine is subjected to heat 
treatment in a heat treating machine being provided with a 
pressure chamber filled with steam or other heating medium. Several means were proposed to charge the synthetic 
fiber tow (referred also to as "crimped fiber lump" 
hereafter) into the pressure chamber in the as-crimped state 
or in an extended form and to draw out the crimped fiber 
lump from the pressure chamber while maintaining the 
pressure inside of the pressure chamber. One of the means to maintain the pressure inside of the 
pressure chamber is to fill the pressure seal parts at the 
entrance and exit of the pressure chamber with the crimped 
fiber lump. Generally, this type of heat treating machine 
feeds the crimped fiber lump by sandwiching it between a  
 
pair of endless conveyer belts from upper and lower side 
thereof (the conveyer is referred to simply as "sandwiching 
conveyer belts" hereafter). For this type of pressure seal 
method, the seal is obtained only by giving a higher 
friction resistance between the crimped fiber lump and the 
sandwiching endless conveyer belts at the pressure seal part 
to stop the leak of pressure in the pressure chamber. To increase the friction resistance aforedescribed and 
to prevent the leak of steam or other heating medium from 
the pressure chamber, the apparent density of crimped fiber 
lump at the entrance of pressure chamber is required to 
increase. However, the introduction of a crimped fiber lump 
having a high apparent density into the pressure chamber 
results in the increased fiber packing density on the 
sandwiching endless conveyer belts, which then requires a 
long period of heat treatment and results in an extendedheat 
treating machine. In addition, within the pressure chamber, 
the crimped fiber lump develops thermal shrinkage along with 
the progress of heat treatment to decrease the cross 
sectional area thereof at the exit pressure seal part of the 
pressure chamber. Consequently, the reduction of vertical resistance 
reduces the friction resistance between the crimped fiber 
lump and the sandwiching endless conveyer belts. Then, the 
pressure seal at the seal part is lost to blow out the  
 
crimped fiber lump to the outside of the exit pressure seal 
part of the pressure chamber. As a
