<ABSTRACT>
A method of joining workpieces (1A, 1B) defining a joint region (2) comprises causing a probe (3) of material harder than the workpiece material to enter the joint region (2) and opposed portions of the workpieces (1A, 1B) on either side of the joint region while causing relative cyclic movement between the probe and the workpieces. Frictional heat is generated to cause the opposed portions to take up the plasticised condition. The probe (3) is removed and the plasticised portions allowed to solidify and join the workpieces together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to friction welding for joining 
two workpieces or two sides of a workpiece. Friction welding has been known for many years and 
typically involves causing relative movement between a pair 
of workpieces while they are urged together so as to 
generate a plasticised region, stopping the relative 
movement and allowing the plasticised region to solidify 
thereby joining the workpieces. It has also been proposed in the past to join 
workpieces by making use of a "non-consumable" member which 
does not form part of the finished joint. An example of 
this approach is shown in US-A-4144110 in which the two 
workpieces are urged together about a rotating wheel which 
causes the plasticised region to be generated. The two 
workpieces are also translated relative to the wheel so 
that they are welded together along a joint region. 
Similar techniques for welding straight-seamed metal pipes 
are disclosed in SU-A-1433522 and SU-A-1362593. The 
problem in all these cases is that the zone which is heated 
is displaced from the point at which the workpieces or 
sides of the pipe are urged together with the result that 
such techniques would need to be carried out in carefully 
controlled atmospheres to prevent oxidation of the 
plasticised region in for example aluminium. JP-A-61176484 discloses a technique using "consumable" 
spinning plugs which are positioned between opposed faces 
of the workpieces and cause the generation of plasticised 
regions within the workpieces and within themselves so that 
as the workpieces are urged together the spinning plugs are 
accumulated into the plasticised region and thereby form 
part of the resulting joint. This is a complex procedure 
requiring the ability to rotate a multitude of spinning 
plugs and to ensure that the plug material is compatible 
with the material of the workpieces. A similar approach is 
described in JP-A-57-149082.  
 In accordance with the present invention, a method of 
joining workpieces defining a joint region therebetween 
comprises carrying out the following steps without causing 
relative bodily movement between the workpieces: causing a 
probe of material harder than the workpiece material to 
enter the joint region and opposed portions of the 
workpieces on either side of the joint region while causing 
relative cyclic movement between the probe and the 
workpieces whereby frictional heat is generated to cause 
the opposed portions to take up a plasticised condition; 
removing the probe; and allowing the plasticised

A method of joining workpieces (1A,1B) defining a 
joint region (2) therebetween, the method comprising 

carrying out the following steps without causing relative 
bodily movement between the workpieces: causing a probe (3) 

of material harder than the workpiece material to enter the 
joint region (2) and opposed portions of the workpieces on 

either side of the joint region while causing relative 
cyclic movement between the probe and the workpieces 

whereby frictional heat is generated to cause the opposed 
portions to take up a plasticised condition; removing the 

probe (3); and allowing the plasticised portions to 
solidify and join the workpieces together. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the joint 
region (2) has an elongate dimension extending laterally 

between the workpieces, the method further comprising 
causing relative translational movement between the 

workpieces and the probe in the direction of the joint 
region. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
probe (3) extends through the thickness of the workpieces 

(1A,1B). 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the probe (3) has an elongate axis which substantially 

intersects the joint region and extends substantially 
parallel with the sides of the workpiece defining the joint 

region. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the probe defines an elongate axis which extends in a 

direction substantially transverse to a plane parallel with 
the joint region. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein 
the workpieces comprise separate members. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the probe has an elongate axis and undergoes cyclic

elongate axis. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein the cyclic 
movement is a reciprocating movement. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein a cross-section through the probe is substantially 

circular.
