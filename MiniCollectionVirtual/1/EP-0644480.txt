<ABSTRACT>
Multiple resonant tunneling devices offer significant advantages for 
realizing ultra-dense, ultra-high performance multivalued logic arithmetic 

integrated circuits. A multivalued logic adder is disclosed, wherein two 
numbers represented by positive digit base-M range-N words are added by 

two-input summation circuits 
(40)
 which sum corresponding digits, then the 
digit sums are decomposed into a binary representation by range-7 

multivalued to binary converter circuits 
(42)
, then three-input summation 
circuits 
(44)
 sum appropriate bits of the binary representations to calculate 
the digits of a positive digit base-2 range-4 word whose value is the sum of the 

two numbers. Preferably, the decomposition to binary representation is 
performed by multi-valued folding circuits 
(56)
 which are connected by voltage 
divider circuitry. Preferably, the multi-valued folding circuits contain 

multiple-peak resonant tunneling transistors 
(54)
. Ripple carries are 
eliminated and the speed of the adder is independent of input word width.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to integrated circuit devices and more 
particularly to multivalued logic circuits comprising resonant tunneling 
devices. Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is 
described in connection with resonant tunneling devices and multivalued 
logic. Within the last decade, heteroepitaxial technology has allowed 
researchers to explore the electrical properties of a variety of superlattice, 
quantum well, and resonant tunneling structures. The first proposals and 
investigations of the resonant tunneling diode (hereinafter referred to as a  
 
RTD) were reported by Chang, Esaki, and Tsu (Applied Physics Letters, 24, p. 
593) and subsequently given impetus by Sollner et al. (Applied Physics 
Letters, 43, p.588) who observed large negative differential resistance 
(hereinafter referred to as NDR) in these structures. Because only discrete 
energy states are available for charge transport through quantum wells, the 
current-voltage relationship of a resonant tunneling diode may exhibit a 
peak, i.e., for applied voltages increasing from zero, the diode current 
increases, then decreases for a range of larger applied voltages. Multiple 
peak resonant tunneling devices (hereinafter referred to as M-RTD) 
consisting of series combinations of RTDs in epitaxial stacks have also been 
demonstrated. Fifteen resonant peaks were achieved in a single 
heterostructure at room temperature recently fabricated at Texas 
Instruments. Since the initial investigations of the RTD, many three-terminal 
resonant tunneling devices have been proposed and demonstrated (see, for 
example, F. Capasso, S. Sen and F. Beltram, High Speed Semiconductor 
Devices (S.M. Sze, ed.), p. 465, John Wiley & Sons, New York). Integration of 
RTDs into one or another of the terminals of conventional transistors has led 
to a large family of resonant tunneling transistors. Among the most 
promising of these transistors are: the resonant tunneling bipolar transistor 
(RTBT) (see, for example, F. Capasso, S. Sen, and A.Y. Cho, Applied Physics 
Letters, 51, p. 526); the resonant tunneling hot electron transistor (RHET) 
(see, for example, N. Yokoyama et al., Solid State Electronics, 31, p. 577); and 
the resonant tunneling field effect transistor (RTFET). These devices are 
fabricated by placing RTDs in the emitter terminals of heterojunction bipolar  
 
transistors, hot electron transistors or field effect transistors, respectively. Nanoelectronic devices, such as resonant tunneling diodes and 
transis
