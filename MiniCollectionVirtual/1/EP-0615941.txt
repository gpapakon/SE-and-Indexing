<ABSTRACT>
A sheet (64) processing apparatus, for example for 
flexographic printing and die-cutting of corrugated 

paperboard container blanks, has first and second 
successive processing sections (14, 18) connected by a 

transfer section (16). The sheets are successively 
passed through the various sections in positional 

registrations therewith. A sensor (40) senses a sheet 
while in the transfer section (16) and provides a signal 

representative of the positional registration of the 
sheet in the transfer section. A computer system (50) 

determines from the signal whether the sheet would enter 
the second section (18) in correct positional registration 

for processing by the second section, and adjusts 
as necessary the positional registration of the sheet 

(64) while in the transfer section to cause the sheet to 
enter the second section (18) in correct positional 

registration therewith. Preferably, the transfer 
section (16) is a vacuum conveyor (41) independently 

driven by one or more electric servo motors (38), the 
conveyor being both accelerated and decelerated to 

adjust sheet registration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a method 
for successively passing individual sheets of corrugated 
paperboard through a flexographic printing section and a 
die cutting section while desirably maintaining register 
of each sheet through each processing section. US-A-5 074 539 discloses an apparatus and method for 
successively passing individual sheets of corrugated paperboard 
through a printing station. During the production of container blanks, sheets 
of corrugated paperboard are successively passed through 
successive processing sections such as printing and die-cutting. 
Printing can have one, two, three or more 
printing sections and employ one or more coloured inks. 
Another section may include creasing. These various 
sections are rotationally (i.e. angularly) timed relative 
to each other so that each sheet theoretically 
passes through each section in register therewith. As 
the various operating members of the processing sections 
rotate in contact with successive sheets, each section 
is intended to perform an operation in the correct 
position on the sheet. In this way, all the operations 
get superimposed on top of each other on the sheet to 
form the final product, e.g. a printed container blank. 
Should any operation not be correctly positioned on the 
sheet, then the sheet is said to be out of registration, 
or out of register, with that operation; and this produces 
an inferior processed sheet. The maintaining of good registration of paperboard 
sheets in the production of colour printed container 
blanks has become more critical with high production 
speeds and demand for higher quality printing and colour 
graphics. The present invention is concerned with improving  
 
the accuracy of positional registration when sheets are 
successively moved from the flexographic printing section 
to the die cutting section. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a sheet processing apparatus for 
producing separate and distinct printed and die-cut 
container blanks from individual sheets of corrugated 
paperboard, wherein said apparatus comprises: 
a flexographic printing section having a rotary 
printing cylinder; and a die cutting section; a transfer section between said flexographic printing 
section and said die cutting section, said transfer 
section comprising a driven conveyor for conveying said 
sheet in a direction from said flexographic printing 
section to said die cutting section; drives connected to said flexographic printing 
section and said

<CLAIMS>
A sheet processing apparatus for producing separate 
and distinct printed and die-cut container blanks from 

individual sheets of corrugated paperboard, 

characterized by
a flexographic printing section (14) having a 
rotary printing cylinder (32); and a die cutting section 

(18); 
a transfer section (16) between said flexographic 
printing section and said die cutting sections, said 

transfer section (16) comprising a driven conveyor (41) 
for conveying said sheet in a direction from said flexographic 

printing section (14) to said die cutting section 
(18); 
drives (36, 46) connected to said flexographic 
printing section and said die cutting section (18); 
at least one motor (38) connected to said driven 
conveyor (41) and operable independently of said drives 

(36, 46); 
sensor means (40) associated with said transfer 
section, for sensing a sheet (64) in said transfer 

section (16) and providing a signal indicative of registration 
of the sheet in the transfer section; and 
control means (50) for determining from said signal 
whether the sheet is in register with said die cutting 

section (18), and if not then controlling at least the 
one motor (38) connected to the driven conveyor (41) to 

accelerate or decelerate said driven conveyor (41) from 
its normal line speed and thereafter immediately return 

said driven conveyor (41) to its normal line speed to 
thereby adjust the registration of the sheet while in 

the transfer section (16) and cause said sheet to enter
