<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a backlash-free overload clutch having one driving and one driven clutch body (15 and 5) which rotate about the same axis and are torque transmittably connected with each other by means of torque transmission bodies (11) which are pressed by springs (7, 8, 12) into facing recesses (18, 19) in the two coupling bodies (15 and 5) in the direction of the parting plane which runs axially, radially or obliquely. In order to allow the clutch to race freely after the set maximum torque has been exceeded, a permanent or electro-magnet counteracting the force of the springs (7, 8, 12) is provided which, at least when the clutch is disengaged, counters the spring force to keep the torque bodies (11) out of at least one of the series of recesses (18 or 19).

<CLAIMS>
Play-free overload clutch having one driving and one 
driven clutch body (15 and 5), which are disposed 

rotatably about the same axis and are connected to one 
another in a torque-transmitting manner by torque 

transmission bodies (11), which are pressed in the 
direction of the parting plane, which extends axially, 

radially or conically between the clutch bodies, by a 
spring arrangement (7, 8, 12) into opposing recesses (18, 

19) in the two clutch bodies (15 and 5), 
characterized in 
that
 a stationary magnet (14; 26) is provided, which 
counteracts the force of the spring arrangement (7, 8, 

12) and, after disengagement of the clutch, holds the 
torque transmission bodies (11) counter to the spring 

force at least out of one of the recesses (18 or 19). 
Overload clutch according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the magnet disposed in the magnet housing (13; 27) 
is a permanent magnet. 
Overload clutch according to claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 an additional electromagnet (14, 26) is provided, 
which in the energized state cancels out the magnetic 

effect of the permanent magnet. 
Overload clutch according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the magnet is an electromagnet (14 or 26) which, at 
least in the disengaged state of the clutch, is 

energized. 
Overload clutch according to claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the electromagnet is energized on the basis of the 
disengagement of the overload clutch which is detected by 

a sensor (20).  
 
Overload clutch according to claim 1, 2 or 4, 

characterized in that
 the spring arrangement (7, 12) acts 
via a thrust collar (6) upon the torque transmission 

bodies (11) and the thrust collar (6) is connected to an 
armature disc (16), which cooperates with the magnet. 
Overload clutch according to claim 6, 
characterized in 
that
 disposed axially between the armature disc (16) and 
the stationary magnet (13, 14; 26) is a rotor (25) which 

is connected to the shaft (B). 
Overload clutch according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the armature disc (16) is fastened to the thrust 
collar (6) and extends radially inwards in the direction 

of the central shaft (B). 
Overload clutch according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 the thrust collar (6) partially 
embraces the torque transmission bodies (11) by means of 

a wedge-shaped annular groove (23) on both sides of their 
radially outer-lying peripheral surfaces (Fig.5), so that 

the bodies (11) may be acted upon by the thrust collar 
(6) axially both in the direction of the spring loading 

and in the opposite direction thereto.
