<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure
sensing device for injection molding machines, to detect
the pressure of a hydraulic cylinder such as an injection
cylinder, etc.An injection molding machine capable to move a
screw by an injection cylinder incorporating a double-rod
type piston is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication
Laid-Open No. 5 (1993)-50483. This type of injection
cylinder is provided with fore and a rear rod, in front and
behind the piston both rods being prepared in an identical
diameter, whereby a fore oil chamber is provided in front of
the piston within the injection cylinder while a rear oil
chamber is likewise formed in the rear thereof. Therefore,
control of the screw in its forward and backward movements,
and stop (position) can be performed by simultaneously.
applying hydraulic pressure to each of these oil chambers. 
It is noted here that the fore rod is coupled to the rear
end of the screw inserted in a barrel cylinder while the
rear rod is spline-joined to the shaft of an oil motor
installed at the rear end of the injection cylinder.Normally, when detecting screw pressure hydraulic
pressures of the oil chamber inside the injection cylinder
is detected by using a pressure sensing device( see Japanese
Granted Patent publication Laid-Open No. 3 (1991)-12528).Therefore, with the injection cylinder having a
double-rod type piston built in, the hydraulic pressures of
the fore and rear oil chamber are respectively detected,
using a pair of pressure sensors, and after the detected
pressure therefrom are respectively amplified by head
amplifiers, the outputs therefrom are subsequently sent to a
deviation computing unit wherein a pressure deviation across
the fore and rear oil chambers is calculated; this deviation
denotes a screw pressure to be detected.Meanwhile, such a pressure sensing device as
described above uses a strain gauge as a pressure sensor,
with the measurement of pressure provided thereby being
inclusive of those errors stemming from the functional
fluctuation characteristic of the strain gauge itself and
positional irregularity of the mounting thereof to the 
injection cylinder. In view of this, therefore, the
pressure deviation computing unit or head amplifier is
normally installed with a zero adjusting and a gain
adjusting circuit whereby zero point and gain adjustments
may be implemented at the stage of initial adjustment.Regrettably, however, when a temperature drift occurs
due to various factors such as the usage environment of an
injection
