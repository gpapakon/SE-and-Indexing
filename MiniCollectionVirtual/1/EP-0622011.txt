<ABSTRACT>
Bale collector (1; 40; 60), comprising a frame (2; 
61) provided with wheels (3; 64), bale-carrying means (13; 

41; 66), coupling means which are suitable for coupling the 
frame to a mobile baler (6; 63) in order to receive bales 

(38; 90) onto the carrying means from a bale outlet (7; 65) 
of the baler via a front end - viewed in the direction of 

travel (8; 64) - of the carrying means, and also control 
means (24 - 33; 30' - 53; 70 - 85) for taking the carrying 

means into a collecting state or into an unloading state, 
for collecting bales on the carrying means or unloading 

collected bales from the carrying means and depositing them 
on the ground. The carrying means comprise rollers 

(13; 41; 66) with parallel horizontal axes, and the rollers 
are suitable for collecting a row of two or more bales 

thereon between the front end and a rear end of the 
carrying means. In one embodiment the carrying means with 

rollers (13; 41) form a two-part bottom which can be moved 
from below bales collected thereon, and which, after a 

complete row of bales (38a, 38b) has collected thereon, 
through control by control means (24 - 33; 30' - 53) opens 

in order to allow the row of bales to pass between the 
bottom parts and be deposited on the ground. In another 

embodiment (60), after initiation of the unloading state, 
the rollers (66) are driven in order to convey the bales 

(90a, 90b, 90c) backwards and deposit them on the ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bale collector according
to the preamble of claim 1.A bale collector of this type is known from
US 3010593. The bale collector known from this document has
a relatively high loading platform on which it receives
bales from a baler. The bales received fall from the
platform onto a conveyor at a lower level. The conveyor
comprises two endless conveyor belts next to each other and
at the same height, extending at right angles to the
direction of travel of the collector and driven stepwise at
right angles to the direction of travel, in order to form a
row of bales on the belts. After a row of bales has been
formed on the conveyor belts, the row is pushed by means of
a bar in the opposite direction to the direction of travel
onto bale-carrying means with a relatively large surface.
The bale-carrying means comprise horizontal rollers, the
axes of which extend at right angles to the direction of
travel. The rollers are driven stepwise during loading of
the bale-carrying means with rows of bales, in such a way
that the rows are moved over the rollers in the opposite
direction to the direction of travel. As soon as the entire
receiving surface of the bale-carrying means and of the
conveyor is filled with rows of bales, an unloading
mechanism is put into operation, following which all
collected bales are deposited on the ground.A bale collector according to the preamble of claim
1 is also known from WO 9011007. In the case of the bale
collector known from this document, the bale-carrying means
consist of horizontal rollers, the axes of which run at
right angles to the direction of travel. At the rear end of
the bale-carrying means there is a blocking roller at a
level above them. The blocking roller is provided with a
conveyor screw thread. One or more rollers of the carrying
means can also be provided with a conveyor screw thread.
The rollers are driven in order to convey a bale received
from the baler over the rollers of the bale-carrying means
until it is against the blocking roller, which bale is
then, or possibly simultaneously, moved by the conveyor 
screw thread of the rollers at right angles to the
direction of travel, so that bales supplied one after
another form a row of bales at right angles to the
direction of travel. On completion of a row, the blocking
roller is lowered, in order to convey the row of bales off
the bale-carrying means. A part of the bale collector
disposed further to the back can receive a number of rows
of bales from the front part of the collector on a

<CLAIMS>
Bale collector (1), comprising a frame (2)
provided with wheels (3), bale-carrying means (13),

coupling means which are suitable for coupling the frame
(2) to a mobile baler (6) in order to receive bales (38)

onto the carrying means from a bale outlet (7) of the baler
via a front end, viewed in the direction of travel (8) of

the carrying means, and also control means (24 - 33)
for taking the carrying means into a collecting state

or into an unloading state, for collecting bales on the
carrying means or unloading bales from the carrying means

and depositing them on the ground, the carrying means
comprising rollers (13) with parallel horizontal axes

at right angles to the direction of travel (8),
and the rollers being suitable for collecting a row of two

or more bales (38) thereon between the front end and a rear
end of the carrying means, 
characterized in that
 the
rollers (13) form a two-part bottom which can be moved

from below bales collected thereon, each bottom part being
fixed to a corresponding sub-frame (11) which is coupled by

way of corresponding rotary means (12) to the frame (2),
while the axes of rotation of the rotary means extend

horizontally and parallel to the direction of travel (8) at
a distance from each other which is greater than a

dimension of the row of bales in a direction at right
angles to the direction of travel, and for reaching the

unloading state from the collecting state the control means
(24 - 331) control the rotary means for turning

the bottom parts downwards in order to allow the row of
bales to go through between the bottom parts and to be

deposited on the ground.
Bale collector (1) according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 drive means are disposed on the
frame, which drive means are coupled to the rollers and in

the collecting state drive the rollers (13), for
conveying the received bales backwards. 
Bale collector (1) according to one of claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the axes of rotation of the
rotary means (12) are disposed above the top of the rollers

(13).
Bale collector (1) according to one of claims 1
to 3, 
characterized in that
 the sub-frames (11) are coupled
to each other by synchronizing means (15 - 18) for

synchronizing the sub-frames (11) relative to the main
frame (2).
Bale collector (1) according to claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the control means (24 - 33) have at the
rear end of the carrying means a control arm (24), the

control means have pre-tensioning means (20) which force
the rollers into the collecting state, and the control

means have locking means (30 - 33) which are coupled to the
control arm (24), in such a way that in the collecting

state when the control arm is moved by a rear bale (38a)
the locking means release the rotary means, in order to

initiate the unloading state.
Bale collector (1) according to one of claims 1
to 5, 
characterized in that
 in the collecting state the
conveyance speed imparted to the bales by the drive means

is lower than or equal to the supply speed of the
bales from the bale
