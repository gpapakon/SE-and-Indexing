<ABSTRACT>
Method for mixing granulates, powders and liquids in a continuous 
process, whereby the material is placed in a mixing housing (2) and is 

mixed therein with the aid of a rotor (6,7) equipped with mixing 
arms (9,12,13). The 

material is thereby moved to and fro many times during one rotation of 
the rotor, towards the rotor axis and away from it. For that purpose 

the device with which the method is implemented has longitudinal stators, 
mounted principally in the axial direction of the rotor, between 

which the mixing arms move when in operation. The mixing housing consists 
preferably of two chambers situated behind one another seen in 

the direction of the axis of the rotor and separated from one another 
by the rotor disk. The material which is to be mixed enters the housing 

in the first chamber, where it is undergoes a preliminary mix, then 

flows into the second chamber and is mixed further there.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for mixing two or more materials
in granular form, in powder form or liquid, with a viscosity which is
or which is not high, in a continuous process in a mixing housing, so
that a mixture with a homogenous distribution arises, whereby those
materials are introduced into the mixing housing, are mixed therein
with the aid of a rotor rotating around an axis, and the mixture is
finally expelled from the mixing housing.Such homogenous mixtures serve, for example, as basic materials
for extruding and injection moulding of plastics. The homogeneity of
such materials is especially important in cases in which one of the
composite materials is a colouring material and a homogenous coloration
of the mixture must be achieved.There are various methods and appertaining devices known in order
to achieve the said homogenous mixtures. Those
methods have in common that those materials are mixed with the aid of a
rotating mechanism in a mixing vessel which is filled with the materials
concerned, in which they are moved around in the mixing housing
in principally a single direction. With these methods it is usually not
possible to achieve the desired completely homogenous mixture. For
example, mixtures of granulates of a plastic and a colouring material
will always show the colour in stripes. This is not improved by continuing
the mixing process for a longer period of time; on the contrary:
in that case a certain separation will even occur in due course
as a result of the differences in the densities of the various materials. Other methods of mixing and appertaining devices are also known. DE-A-1 646 768
describes an apparatus for mixing two or more materials in a continuous process in a mixing
housing, in granular form, powder form or liquid, so that a mixture with a homogenous distribution
arises. The materials to be mixed are introduced into the mixing housing, where
they are mixed with the aid of a rotor which rotates around an axis. The mixing process takes
place by moving the material in the mixing housing several times during one rotation of the
mixing rotor in an approximately radial direction in respect of the rotation axis, alternately
towards and from the rotor axis.US-A-4 113 191 describes a device with a principally circular-cylindrically shaped mixing
housing, with the inlet and the outlet opening of the housing in the cylinder wall and approximately
diametrically opposite one another, and with a mixing rotor in the mixing housing
which can be rotated around an axis which
