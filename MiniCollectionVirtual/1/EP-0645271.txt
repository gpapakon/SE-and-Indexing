<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a power 
train that is interposed between the internal 

combustion engine (11) and the drive ratio selection 
transmission (39) of a vehicle. An electric 

motor/generator (14) is operatively connected to a 
power transmission (10), and the power transmission 

selectively drives accessories (53-56) to the internal 
combustion engine, such as an oil pump, power steering 

pump and air conditioning compressor. The power 
transmission employs compounded first and second 

planetary gear sets (19,21). A common gear member 
(16) serves not only as the ring gear for the first 

planetary gear set but also as the sun gear for the 
second planetary gear set. The electric 

motor/generator drives the accessories when the 
internal combustion engine is idling or off, allowing 

those accessories to be smaller while delivering 
adequate output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
vehicular power transmissions. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a power transmission that 
is capable of receiving input torque from both an 
electric motor and an internal combustion engine, a 
power train incorporating such a power transmission, 
and a method of driving accessories through such a 
power train. Specifically, the present invention relates 
to an integrated hybrid power transmission that is 
operatively connected to an integral electric 
motor/generator that not only starts the internal 
combustion engine, but also augments a friction 
starting clutch with electrically generated torque 
and/or electric motor inertia torque for launching 
movement of the vehicle. The rotational power input to the normally 
engine-powered accessories, such as oil pumps, power 
steering pumps and the like, is provided at the 
connection of the internal combustion engine to the 
input of the hybrid power transmission. The input to 
the accessories is, therefore, continuously rotated 
with the rotor of the electric motor/generator. This 
arrangement makes it possible to take advantage of the 
power provided by, and the rotational rate of, the 
electric motor/generator, rather than limit the input 
to the accessories to that receivable directly, and 
exclusively, from the internal combustion, as has been 
customary with prior art arrangements. The present invention relates to power 
transmissions to coordinate the torque output of an 
electric motor/generator and an internal combustion 
engine to a drive ratio selection transmission, and 
especially to planetary gear sets and the associated  
 
torque transfer devices utilised for providing the 
desired interaction between the internal combustion 
engine and the electric motor/generator to meet the 
economic and emission requirements of internal 
combustion engines to propel vehicles. The power transmission disclosed herein drives 
engine accessories when the internal combustion engine 
is idling, or even turned off, thereby allowing those 
accessories to be designed for operation in conjunction 
with the rotor of the electric motor/generator, the 
minimum speed of which is of the order of two to three 
times the idling speed of an internal combustion engine. Motor/generators have heretofore been 
employed for launching vehicles. However, the prior 
art has not appreciated and has not, therefore, 
disclosed how an integrated motor/generator can be 
incorporated in the overall operation of a

<CLAIMS>
A power train for a vehicle, said power train comprising: 

an internal combustion engine (11) to provide a source of 
torque; 
an electric motor/generator (14) to provide a second source of 
torque; 
a drive ratio selection transmission (34); 
a power transmission (10); and 
an accessory drive (52) operatively connected to the power 
transmission;
 
characterised in that 
the power transmission includes compounded first and second 
planetary gear sets (19,20); each planetary gear set having first gear means 

(24,16), second gear means (16,28) and a plurality of planetary gears (22,25) 

mounted on a carrier (23,26) operatively to connect the first and second gear 
means of the respective first and second planetary gear sets; a common gear 

member (16) serving not only as the second gear means for the first planetary 
gear set but also as the first gear means for the second planetary gear set; the 

internal combustion engine adapted selectively to provide torque to the power 
transmission through the carrier for the second planetary gear set; 
by means (33) selectively to transfer torque between the electric 
motor/generator and the power transmission through the carrier for the second 

planetary gear set; 
by means (34) selectively to transfer torque to and from the 
drive ratio selection transmission and the internal combustion engine, the 

means also transferring torque from the internal combustion engine to the 
power transmission; 
by means (31,32) selectively connecting the carrier for the first 
planetary gear set to ground;  

 
by means (42) selectively connecting the drive ratio selection 
transmission to ground; and 
in that the accessory drive is operatively connected to the 
electric motor/generator;

and 10 times the speed of the internal combustion engine (11) when the 
internal combustion engine is idling. 
A power train as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the accessory 
drive (52) is functionally locatable between the internal combustion engine 

(11) and the drive ratio selection transmission (39). 
A power train as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein 
the accessory drive (52) is driven by the electric motor/generator (14) when 

the internal engine (11) is off. 
A power train as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the power train further comprises an accessory (53-56) connected to 

and drivable by the accessory drive (52).
