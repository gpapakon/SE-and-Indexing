<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for pigmenting high molecular weight organic materials
which utilizes carbazole dioxazine crude to generate unique color effects and to compositions
containing the carbazole dioxazine crude and a high molecular weight organic material.The dioxazine pigment class is well known for its strong bluish-red to violet colors. Due to its
outstanding tinctorial strength and saturation and excellent heat and light resistance, carbazole
dioxazine, C.I. Pigment Violet 23, became the most important dioxazine violet on the
worldwide pigment market. In general, C.I. Pigment Violet 23 has a violet color, a particle
size less than 0.5 µm and a specific surface area greater than about 25 m2/g.In general, carbazole dioxazine crude has a greenish color, a particle size greater than 0.5 µm
and a specific surface area from about 2 to 20 m2/g and can be processed into C.I. Pigment
Violet 23. Carbazole dioxazine crude can be prepared according to the process disclosed in
JP 56-141555A2 (Chem. Abstr., 96(1):70437d).It is known in the art to process carbazole dioxazine crude into C.I. Pigment Violet 23 by
reducing its particle size. US 4,785,999 describes the dry milling of polycyclic crude
pigments. DE 2,742,575 describes the dry grinding of large crystals of unrefined carbazole
dioxazine crude in an oscillating mill, followed by treatment of the milled materials with solvents
containing surfactants and weak acids to produce C.I. Pigment Violet 23. In EP 75,182,
the carbazole dioxazine crude is treated with polyphosphoric acid followed by drowning into
water, ice and/or a water miscible organic liquid to produce C.I. Pigment Violet 23.
US 4,804,417 discloses pigment-grade dioxazine violet produced from crude material by
converting to the sulphate followed by hydrolysis and treatment with alcohol and inorganic
salt. The processed pigment has a cleaner hue, greater color strength, good dispersibility,
smaller particle size (less than 0.5 µm) than the crude material and a specific surface area over
25 m2/g.According to DE 2,210,073, deep colourations can be obtained through incorporation of crude
pigments of specific surface area between 0.5 and 15 m2/g into a binder in a ratio from 7 : 1 to
1 : 9. This process however requires extended time, and the particle size must be less than
1 µm. There is no mention of carbazole dioxazine. Prior to the present invention, it was believed in the art that the carbazole dioxazine crude had
little coloring value on its own and was useful only as an
