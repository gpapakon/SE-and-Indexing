<ABSTRACT>
The frame (1) for chairs and tables has four frame parts (4) which are arranged in one plane at an angle to one another, are constructed as flat wooden elements and are made of solid wood, preferably beechwood, the joint ends (5) of which are connected to one another and adhesively bonded by means of male tines (male prongs) (6) to form a cross with different separation angles ( alpha ,  beta ). A connecting element (7) serves for positive reception of the joint ends (5) of the four frame parts (4). The connecting element (7) is composed of an upper part (8) and a lower part (9). The upper part (8) and lower part (9) of the connecting element (7) positively receive the joint ends (5) of the frame parts (4) in corresponding openings (10) and are screwed to the frame parts (4). The upper part (8) and lower part (9) of the connecting element (7) preferably consist of gusset plates (junction plates).

<CLAIMS>
Wooden frame for chairs and tables, said frame (1) having 
four frame portions (4), the inner ends (5) of the frame 

portions (4) being interconnected by a connector member (7)

or different angular pitch (α, β), the connector member (7) 
being composed of an upper (8) and a lower portion (9), and 

in that the upper portion (8) and the lower portion (9) 
receive the frame portions (4) in openings, and are screwed 

to the latter.
