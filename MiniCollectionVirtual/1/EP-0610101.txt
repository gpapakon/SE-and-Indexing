<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to improved wax-coated 
containers and, more particularly, to wax-coated paperboard 
containers which are capable of being recycled under 
standard repulping conditions in a hydropulper without 
significantly increasing the repulping temperature or pH. Wax-coated containers, particularly wax-coated 
corrugated paperboard containers have been used for years to 
ship and store fresh, perishable foods such as poultry, fish 
and meat. Typically, the containers are packed with crushed 
ice to keep the food cool during shipping and storage. The 
wax imparts water and moisture resistance to the containers. Examples of wax-coated or wax-impregnated 
paperboard containers are described in U.S. Patents 
3,892,613 to McDonald et al.; 4,017,016 to Ivy; 4,126,225 to 
Hyland et al., and 4,948,033 to Halsell, II et al. As shown 
in Halsell, II et al., the paperboard may be impregnated 
with about 6 pounds per 1,000 square feet of a wax blend and 
then curtain coated with an additional 6.5 pounds per 1,000 
square feet of wax blend. Currently, wax-coated containers are not recycled 
for several reasons. In view of the large quantity of wax-coated 
containers which are used each year, it would be 
highly desirable to recycle the containers rather than to 
simply discard them. The reclamation of waste paper has 
been the subject of various patents and studies. For 
example, U.S. Patents 3,440,134 to Murphy, Jr., 4,347,009 to 
DeCuester et al.; 4,548,674 to Hageman et al.; and 4,737,238 
to deRuvo, are related to methods for pulping waste paper 
and, particularly, used corrugated containers. Several problems are inherent in recycling wax-coated 
containers. First, the purpose of the wax is to  
 
impart water and moisture resistance to the container and 
this property directly interferes with the essential 
property required in a recyclable container, namely, 
repulpability. Hence, it is necessary to remove the wax 
coating in the recycling process. Second, in removing the 
wax coating, a wax residue may remain on or contaminate the 
paper fibers. This residue weakens the strength of the 
recycled sheet because it prevents or reduces the amount of 
interfiber bonding such as hydrogen bonding which can be 
achieved in the sheet. Third, due to the high melting 
points of many of the waxes conventionally used in wax-coated 
containers, in order to remove the coating, it is 
necessary to modify the industry standard repulping 
conditions to use higher repulping temperatures. This can 
lead to
