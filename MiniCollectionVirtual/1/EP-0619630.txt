<ABSTRACT>
In some applications of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers, it is 
important that the coupling constant κ be closely controlled. This is not easily 

achieved, frequently resulting in low yield of acceptable devices. I have discovered 
that variations in κ can be reduced if the DFB laser is designed such that the 

thickness t
s
 of a spacer layer (between the active layer and the Bragg grating) is 
within about ± 10% of the value t
o
/(1 - α), where t
o
 is the modal decay length, and 
α is a parameter which characterizes the fractional variation of t
o
 with fractional 
changes in layer thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method of making an article that comprises a distributed feedback semiconductor laser·Distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor lasers are known. Such
lasers comprise a feature that serves to suppress emission of radiation of all but one
longitudinal spatial mode. In one well known type of DFB laser the feature is a
"grating", e.g., a "corrugated" interface between two semiconductor layers. The
grating is spaced from the active region of the laser and can be located either below
or above the active region.The degree of interaction of the radiation field in the laser cavity (of
length L) with the grating is generally expressed in terms of the coupling constant κ,
a parameter that depends on the spacing between the active region and the grating,
and also depends on the "strength" of the grating. Maintenance of κ within relatively
narrow limits is an important manufacturing requirement for at least some grating
DFB lasers, e.g., for such lasers that are intended for use in analog applications such
as optical fiber analog CATV. See, for instance, U.S. patents 5,012,484 and
5,111,475. In these lasers κL is desirably within relatively narrow limits of a
predetermined value that maximizes linearity of the laser output as a function of
drive current. For instance, the specifications for one such device call for the
normalized variation of κL (i.e., δ(κL)/κL) to be at most about 13%. This is a
requirement that is difficult to meet with at least some prior art grating DFB lasers,
resulting in low manufacturing yield, and consequently, high cost of the lasers.Among the reasons for the difficulty of close control of κL is the
difficulty of close control in a manufacturing environment of the spacing between
the active region of the laser and the grating. For instance, it is known that even a
minor departure of the wafer temperature from the target temperature during layer
growth can significantly affect the layer growth rate. Furthermore, applicable
growth techniques (e.g., MOCVD) typically result in at least some layer thickness
variation across the wafer.In view of the commercial significance of grating DFB lasers with
closely controlled value of κL, it would be desirable to have available such lasers
that are less subject to κL variation than are corresponding prior art lasers. This 
application discloses such laser.The invention is defined by the claims. In a broad aspect the invention
is embodied in a method of making an article that comprises an improved DFB semiconductor laser.
