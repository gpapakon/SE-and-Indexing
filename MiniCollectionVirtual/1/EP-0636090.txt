<DESCRIPTION>
CAN BODYThe invention relates to sheet metal can bodies such as are used to contain processed foods or beverages. GB 2 237 550 describes a can body in which the side wall includes a plurality of adjacent panels in the form of single concave flutes. Each flute is defined laterally on each side by a convex rib lying on the cylindrical envelope of the side wall. The panels tend to flex in groups when the can body is subject to an internal pressure reduction and return to their relaxed position when the pressure reduction is relieved.The present invention relates to a modification of the can body of GB 2 237 550 which has particular application where an internal pressure reduction is maintained in a can body after processing of the food or beverage therein is complete and the can has returned to ambient temperature . This occurs for example in the case of hot filling of eg fruit juices. Pressure reduction after processing may also be obtained as a result of the can volume increasing during processing due to a high internal pressure causing expansion of the can ends and side wall.A prior solution to the problem of residual internal pressure reduction in can bodies is described in US 4 836 398. In this solution the bottom wall of the can body is reformed after filling and sealing to increase the internal pressure. This requires the provision of a specially formed bottom wall and adds an additional step to the process of filling cans. In the present invention a can body is provided in which large flexible panels are formed by groups of concave flutes. These panels can flex to reduce or increase the internal volume of the can body when it is subjected to an internal pressure reduction or increase. According to the present invention there is 

provided a sheet metal can body comprising an end wall and a tubular side wall upstanding from the periphery of the end wall, the side wall being formed from a plain cylinder defining a cylindrical envelope of the side wall; wherein the tubular side wall includes a plurality of flexible panels recessed within the cylindrical envelope of the side wall and each of which extends generally parallel to the central axis of the side wall and is connected at each of its ends to a cylindrical portion of the side wall; wherein each panel is formed of a plurality of elongate concave flutes extending generally parallel to the central axis of the side wall, each flute being defined laterally on each side by a convex rib; wherein the outermost convex ribs of each panel lie on the

CLAIMS
1. A sheet metal can body comprising an end wall and a tubular side wall upstanding from the periphery of the end wall, the side wall being formed from a plain cylinder defining a cylindrical envelope of the side wall; wherein the tubular side wall includes a plurality of flexible panels recessed within the cylindrical envelope of the side wall and each of which extends generally parallel to the central axis of the side wall and is connected at each of its ends to a cylindrical portion of the side .wall; wherein each panel is formed of a plurality of elongate concave flutes extending generally parallel to the central axis of the side wall, each flute being defined laterally on each side by a convex rib; wherein the outermost convex ribs of each panel lie on the cylindrical envelope of the side wall of the can and, at least in the longitudinal middle region of the panels, the remaining convex ribs of each panel lie inside the cylinÎ±rical envelope of the side wall; and wherein the perimeter and envelope of the side wall are substantially constant along the entire length of the side wall.
2. A can body as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the said remaining convex ribs lie substantially on a chord of the cylindrical envelope of the side wall.
3. A can body as claimed in Claim 1, wherein each panel is separated circumferentially from adjacent panels by a part cylindrical wall portion connecting the cylindrical portions of the side wall.
4. A can body as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the panels are contiguous. 5. A can body as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 


4, wherein the ends of the panels have a substantially elliptical outline.
6. A can body as claimed in Claim 1, in which the number of panels is in the range from 4 to 12.
7. A can body as claimed in Claim 1 in which, at their greatest width, the panels occupy at least 70% of the circumference of the can body.
8. A can body as claimed in Claim 1, wherein each panel has a number of flutes in the range from 2 to 8.
9. A can body as claimed in Claim 1 in which, at their greatest width, the flutes occupy at least 70% of the circumferential extent of each panel.
10. A can body as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the panels are equispaced around the circumference of the can body and all the panels are identical.
