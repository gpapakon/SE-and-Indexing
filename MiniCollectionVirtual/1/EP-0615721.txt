<ABSTRACT>
A laser beam emitted by a laser light source 1 is scanned in a series of small, 
high-speed oscillations in a first scanning direction by an acousto-optical deflector 

4, and scanned at a lower frequency in a second direction perpendicular to the first 
scanning direction by a vibration mirror galvanometer 8M, and scanned at yet 

a lower frequency in a third direction, parallel to the first direction, by a mirror 
galvanometer 11M in order to enable high-precision scanning, and is projected 

onto a prescribed region of an eye 14. Light reflected by the eye 14 passes, via 
the mirror galvanometers 11M and 8M, through a confocal optical aperture 16 

and is converted to an electrical signal by a photosensor 18. The signal is then 
converted by signal processor 19 to a standard television line format.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ophthalmoscope, and more particularly to 
a scanning laser ophthalmoscope in which a laser beam from a laser light source 
is projected onto a prescribed part of an eye and scanned in two dimensions, and 
light reflected from the eye is detected by light receiving means and photoelectrically 
converted to thereby obtain image information about the eye. In vivo examination of the eye fundus is used not only for ophthalmological 
purposes but also for diagnosing other disorders that include hypertension, 
diabetes, and diseases of the cerebral nerves. One technique used for such examinations 
involves the physician using a device known as the ophthalmoscope to 
directly observe the eye fundus. In another method that is extensively applied, 
a special fundus camera is used to record photographs of the fundus on conventional 
film. The advances made in recent years by electronics have led to the use 
of optoelectronic transducers such as imaging tubes and the like in place of the 
photographic film of the conventional fundus camera, whereby eye fundus information 
is directly obtained in the form of electric signals which can be processed, 
stored and displayed on a television monitor or the like.  One innovative development in ophthalmology that has attracted attention 
is that of an electronic ophthalmoscope that utilizes laser scanning techniques. 
Such a device is known as a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (hereinafter also 
abbreviated to "SLO"), and is being developed and improved mainly in the U.S., 
Germany, France and Japan. With the first SLOs, a laser beam was passed through the center of the pupil 
and used to scan the eye fundus two-dimensionally, and the light reflected from 
the fundus through a larger area around the periphery of the pupil was picked up, 
photoelectrically converted and amplified, whereby with the fundus illuminated 
at a low brightness it was possible to display a video image of the fundus on a 
monitor television in real-time with a high S/N ratio (see Reference (1): USP 
4213678 and Applied Optics Vol. 19 (1980) pp 2991 to 2997). The feasibility of using an active optical element to compensate for the effect 
of aberration in the optical system of the eye was studied as a way of achieving 
a major improvement in fundus image resolution, compared to the conventional 
fundus camera (see Reference (2): DP 3245939, USP 4579430, JP-A-59-115024, 
SPIE Proceedings Vol. 498 (1984) pp 76 to 82). The adoption of a confocal optical system in the
