<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radial tire. 
containing steel monofilaments in the carcass ply of 
the tire. Conventionally, the carcass of radial pneumatic 
tires for use in passenger and light truck 
applications have polyester filaments embedded 
therein. These filaments are woven into cords to 
increase the ultimate strength of the carcass ply. It 
has also been known to use monofilaments made of 
fiberglass or polyester in the tire; however, due to 
the inherent properties of these synthetic polymers, 
the strength requirements needed for the carcass are 
unmet. Thus, commercially the use of the polyester 
cord in the carcass has dominated. Unfortunately, as 
a result of using cord in a carcass, the weight 
contributed to the tire from the cord is high. With 
the ever present desire of auto manufacturers to 
increase the mileage requirements of their vehicles, 
there is a large demand for lighter tires without 
sacrificing their strength integrity. The present invention relates to a pneumatic 
radial tire having a carcass ply which comprises a 
layer of steel monofilaments. The advantages of the 
present invention include a tire which not only 
maintains excellent handling characteristics but does 
so without the conventional weight aspects of typical 
reinforcements in the carcass.  
 Fig. 1 shows a pneumatic tire in partial 
sectional view. Fig. 2 illustrates a radially cross-section 
through a radial carcass tire. There is disclosed pneumatic radial tire 
comprising: 
(a) a pair of axially spaced apart annular 
beads; and  (b) at least one carcass ply which extends 
between said beads and is folded thereabout wherein 
said carcass ply comprises a layer of steel 
monofilaments arranged so as to have from 25 to 124 
ends per inch when measured in a tire circumferential 
direction at a location having a tire maximum width, 
   each said steel monofilament having 
a tensile strength of at least 3650 MPa, 
a diameter of from 0.1 mm to 0.22 mm, 
a total elongation of at least 2%, and a 
torsion value of at least 20 turns with a 
gauge length of 200 times the diameter of 
said monofilament. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the present invention 
relates to a pneumatic tire 10. "Pneumatic tire" 
means a laminated mechanical device of generally 
toroidal shape (usually an open-torus) having beads, 
at least one carcass ply and a tread. When mounted on 
the wheel of a motor vehicle, the tire through its 
tread provides traction and contains the fluid that 
sustains the vehicle load. More specifically, the
