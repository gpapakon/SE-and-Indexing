<ABSTRACT>
In a part (P) feeding apparatus including a feeder bowl 
(1) for discharging and feeding parts (P) to an assembly 

apparatus and a hopper (6) for discharging and feeding 
parts (P) to the feeder bowl (1), a counter (1001) for counting 

parts discharged from the hopper and a counter (1002) for 
counting parts (P) discharged from the feeder bowl (1) are 

provided. The hopper (6) is driven, so that a difference 
between values (N1,N2) of the two counters (4,9) is brought close to a 

definite value (No).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a part feeding 
apparatus which can perform a stable feedback control upon 
a feeding amount of parts such as semiconductor elements. For example, in a semiconductor element assembly 
apparatus, a part feeding apparatus for feeding parts 
which are, in this case, semiconductor elements has been 
combined therewith. In such a part feeding apparatus, it 
is important to stabilize the amount of parts fed to the 
assembly apparatus so that it is brought close to a 
definite value, to thereby suppress fluctuation of a rate 
of operation of the assembly apparatus. A first prior art part feeding apparatus is 
constructed by a feeder bowl for discharging and feeding 
parts to the assembly apparatus, a feeder bowl driving 
unit, i.e., an electromagnetic oscillation applying unit, 
a sensor for detecting parts discharged from the feeder 
bowl, and a counter for counting the number of parts 
discharged from the feeder bowl. In this case, an 
oscillation amplitude of the electromagnetic oscillation 
applying unit is changed in accordance with a difference 
between the number of parts discharged from the feeder 
bowl per unit time and a definite value, so that the 
number of parts discharged from the feeder bowl is 
brought close to the definite value (see Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 2-231305). 
In this first prior art part feeding apparatus, however, 
since the oscillation amplitude of the electromagnetic 
oscillation applying unit is changed, this oscillation 
amplitude may be deviated from an optimum value, thus 
inviting fluctuation of the number of parts discharged 
from the feeder bowl. This will be explained later in  
 
detail. A second prior art part feeding apparatus is 
constructed by a feeder bowl for discharging and feeding 
parts to the assembly apparatus, a feeder bowl driving 
unit, i.e., an electromagnetic oscillation applying unit, 
a sensor disposed within the feeder bowl, a hopper for 
discharging and feeding parts to the feeder bowl, and a 
hopper driving unit, i.e., an electromagnetic oscillation 
applying unit. In this case, the sensor detects whether or 
not the number of parts within the feeder bowl is smaller 
than a definite value. As a result, when the number of 
parts within the feeder bowl is smaller than the definite 
value, the hopper driving unit is turned ON to discharge 
and feed parts to the feeder bowl. Contrary to this, when 
the number of parts within the feeder bowl is not smaller 
than the definite value, the hopper
