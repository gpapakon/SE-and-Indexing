<ABSTRACT>
Mask patterns and thire exposure times are stored in a 
memory (120) within a controller (100). The controller (100) 

transfers the mask pattern to a memory (313) in the liquid 
crystal controller (310). The mask pattern stored in the 

memory (313) is displayed on the matrix liquid crystal 
display element (321). The controller (100) transfers the 

next mask pattern to the memory (313) after the elapse of 
exposure time. By this exposure apparatus, a plurality of 

mask patterns is exposed on a photosensitive material. The 
exposure time of each portion of the photosensitive material 

is adjusted in three or more grades by exposing a plurality 
of mask patterns sequentially. If the photosensitive 

material is positive, the film thickness becomes low in a 
portion which has a long exposure time and high in a portion 

which has a short exposure time. A combination of a 
plurality of mask patterns enables the section of the 

photosensitive material to be formed into a desired shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for forming a
photosensitive material for the manufacture of wiring boards
and, more particularly, to a process for forming the section
of a photosensitive material into a desired shape by
exposure.In the manufacture of wiring boards, thick or thin films
of predetermined patterns are laminated. One of the
techniques for fcrming a thick or thin film into a
predetermined pattern is photolithography. An example of the
technique for forming a thick or thin film by the use of
photolithography is described in the "Microelectronics
Packaging Handbook," Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989, pp. 706-708.
This reference describes a process for forming a thin
film but, in the reference, page 706, line 21, it is
described that a similar technique can also be applied to
form a thick film. Referring to lines 14-21 on page 706 and
FIGS. 9-17 on page 708, a photosensitive material is mixed
into dielectric slurry which is a raw material for a thin
film. The slurry is applied to a substrate by screen-printing.
The applied slurry is exposed to ultraviolet
light. The slurry is selectively exposed by means of a
photomask having a pattern formed therein for intercepting
light. Portions covered by the pattern are not exposed.
Unexposed portions of the slurry are washed away. After
unexposed portions are washed away, the slurry is fired,
forming a thin film having the same pattern as that of the
photomask.In this process, each portion of the photomask either
transmits or intercepts light. In addition, the photomask
pattern remains unchanged during exposure. For this reason,
all portions of the slurry to be exposed are exposed to an
equal amount of light.In the above technique, a thick or thin film is
considered to be a two-dimensional pattern, and its sectional
configuration is ignored. In-addition, no attempt is made to
form the section cf a thick or thin film into a desired
shape. GB-A-2 247 535 relates to a method of forming a pattern
on a semiconductor element in order to form a step pattern
on the surface of a semiconductor as pre-exposed through a
first photomask and then exposed through a second photomask.In IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 35, No. 3,
August 1992, New York, U.S., pages 15 and 16, XP002008181,
titled "Control of Edge Shape of Photoresist Images", a
system has been described in which the focus of a projection
system is varied during exposure of photoresist.In US-A-4 675 702, a photoplotter has been disclosed
which supports a sheet of photosensitive material for
