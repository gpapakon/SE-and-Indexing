<ABSTRACT>
The pressure-applying device has the pressure-applying elements (4, 5) which rest on the workpiece to be worked. For adaption to use different cutting-circle diameters (9) of the tools (6), the pressure-applying elements (4, 5) can be adjusted in a direction (22, 23) lying obliquely with respect to the transporting direction (11) of the workpieces. In order to be able to set the pressure-applying elements (4, 5) in relation to the profile depth (8) of the profile cutters of the tool (6), too, the pressure-applying elements (4, 5) can be adjusted in a direction (23, 34) lying with opposite obliquity with respect to the transporting direction (11). The position of the adjusting directions (22, 33, 23, 34) is chosen so that the pressure-applying elements (4, 5), upon adjustment, arrive at an optimal position in dependence on the cutting-circle diameter (9) and the profile depth (8) of the respective tool (6).

A pressing device for machines for cutting workpieces of wood, plastics material and the 
like, with at least one rotatably driven spindle on which cutting tools can be secured 

which have a diameter of reach determined by cutters, in particular moulding cutters, and 
with pressing members which are arranged in front of and behind the spindle in the conveying 

direction of the workpieces to be cut and which are displaceable transversely to 
the axis of the spindle in order to adapt to different diameters of reach and to different 

moulding depths of the moulding cutters, 
characterized in that
 the pressing members 
(4, 5) are displaceable opposite to each other in one direction (22, 33) orientated obliquely 

to the conveying direction (11) in order to adapt to different diameters of reach (9) of 
the tools (6) and in another opposite direction (23, 34) orientated obliquely to the conveying 

direction (11) in order to adapt to the respective moulding depth (8) of the moulding 
cutters. 
A pressing device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the displacement directions 
(22, 23, 33, 34) of the pressing members (4, 5), projected into one plane, form the 

shape of a W. 
A pressing device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the setting drives 
(20, 21; 24, 25; 35; 36) for displacing the pressing members (4, 5) are spindle drives. 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the setting 
drives (20, 21, 35) for displacing the pressing members (4, 5) in one direction (22, 33) 

are connected to at least one setting device (3) which comprises a display (13) designating 
the diameter of reach (9). 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the setting 
drives (24, 25, 36) for displacing the pressing members (4, 5) in the other direction (23, 

34) are connected to at least one further setting device (2) which comprises a display (12) 
designating the moulding depth (8). 
A pressing device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 by means of the 
display (12, 13) the diameter of reach (9) and the moulding depth (8) can be set with the 

setting devices (2, 3) preferably provided on a support (1) rigid with the machine.  
 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the setting 
devices (2, 3) each have a rotary sleeve (14, 15) connected to the display elements of the 

display (12, 13). 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 4 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the rotary 
sleeves (14, 15) are coupled preferably mechanically to the setting drives (20, 21; 24, 25; 

35; 36). 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 4 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the setting 
devices (2, 3) are connected electronically to the setting drives (20, 21; 24, 25; 35; 36). 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 one pressing 
member (4) is provided on a slide part (29) which is mounted displaceably on a further 

slide part (30) which is preferably mounted displaceably on the support (1). 
A pressing device according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the two slide parts (29, 
30) are displaceable with respect to each other at an acute angle. 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the other 
pressing member (5) is mounted displaceably on an intermediate support (18) which in 

turn is arranged displaceably on the support (1). 
A pressing device according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the intermediate support 
(18) and the other pressing member (5) are displaceable with respect to each other at an 

acute angle. 
A pressing device according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that
 the pressing 
members (4, 5) are jointly displaceable in a synchronous manner in opposite directions in 

the directions (22, 23; 33, 34) situated obliquely opposite one another.
