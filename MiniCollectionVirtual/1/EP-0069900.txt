<ABSTRACT>
1. Lock with an axially immovable cylinder core (2) mounted rotatably in a bore of a cylinder housing (1) and comprising tumblers, by which core a coaxial locking journal (11) is moved axially through a pin (12) and cam path (13), characterised in that on the side of the cylinder core (2) opposite to the key entry there is mounted in the rotation-fast cylinder housing (1) a coaxial control ring (8) of bush form which is rotatable by the cylinder core (2) and displaceable axially in relation to the cylinder core (2) by a cam path (10) of groove or slot form and a dog (9) lying therein, and in that internally in the control ring (8) there is mounted the end of a rotation-fast locking journal (11) which is displaceable in relation to the control ring (8) by reason of the rotation of the control ring by a further cam path (13), of groove or slot form, of the control ring (8) with dog (12) lying therein.
