<ABSTRACT>
A coating composition is described comprising a 

hydrolysable ester and at least one silyl groups-containing 
compound selected from the group consisting of poly­

esters, vinyl polymers, diallyl phthalate compounds and 
diallyl phthalate copolymers. The addition of readily hy­

drolysable esters improves the shelf stability of the coating 
composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition 
comprising a hydrolysable ester and a silyl 
groups-containing compound which hardens in 
the presence of moisture. Compounds of the condensation type, which 
possess a hydrolytic group such as a hydroxy, 
an acetoxy, an alkoxy or an oxime group have 
been widely used for various technical fields 
such as paints, coatings, adhesives for rubbers or 
sealants. These compounds harden at room 
temperature either in the absence or in the 
presence of a catalyst when the hydrolytic 
group is properly selected. However, when the 
reactivity between the hydrolytic group and 
moisture is increased, the shelf stability tends to 
decrease. Besides, it is difficult to keep these 
compounds completely free from moisture 
when storing them, whether they are pure or 
contained in a mixture or solution: in short, they 
gradually react with a trace of moisture and 
show an increase in viscosity. On the other 
hand, the penetration of moisture from the air 
into the compounds is inevitable when they are 
used very often and exposed repeatedly to the 
air. Moreover, there is a strong likelihood that 
adsorption moisture from the surface of 
pigments or fillers penetrates into the 
compounds when compositions are prepared by 
blending several compounds; this sometimes 
causes gelation during blending if the moisture 
content becomes too high. Although the 
moisture adhering to such additives can be 
removed by previous heat-treatment, or by 
forming azeotropes in xylene, the respective 
process is actually not easily practicable.  
 US-A-4,157,321 discloses copolymers of an ethylenically 
unsaturated organic monomer and an unsaturated organosilane 
monomer which are stabilized against viscosity increase and 
gelation by the addition thereto of a monomeric hydrolytically 
reactive compound chosen from the group consisting of (i) 
monomeric hydrolytically reactive organosilanes and (ii) 
trialkyl orthoformates;and an alkyl alcohol. According to US-A-4,043,953 the potlife of an ambient temperature, 
moisture-curable coating composition comprising an 
acrylic silane interpolymer which is devoid of active hydrogen 
atoms, and a cure-accelerating catalyst is increased by 
the addition to the composition of from about 0.5 percent to 
about 15 percent by weight of interpolymer solids of a monomeric 
hydrolytically reactive organosilicon compound represented 
by the structural formula: 
XnSi(OR)4-n 
wherein X is an organic radical having from 1 to 12 carbon 
atoms, R is methyl, ethyl,
