<ABSTRACT>
A device for adjusting capsule yarn brakes on twisting machines, in particular two-for-one twisting machines. A capsule yarn brake is arranged within the twisting spindle, with a brake ring (12) which is arranged on a brake-ring carrier (12.1-13) movable counter to spring force (17). Arranged on the brake-ring carrier (12.1-13) is an annular piston (14) guided in an annular cylinder (15) which is connected to a compressed-air conduit (16). Arranged on the circumference of the brake-ring carrier (12.1-13) is a first toothed quadrant (18) with downward-directed teeth, opposite which is located a second toothed quadrant (19) with upward-directed teeth. On displacement of the brake-ring carrier (12.1-13), an inward-projecting supporting stop (20) engages into the slots formed between the teeth of the toothed quadrants (18, 19). The tooth flanks of the two toothed quadrants (18, 19) have sloping faces, such that, during an up-and-down movement of the brake-ring carrier (12.1-13), a rotation of the brake-ring carrier through predetermined angular amounts takes place and, as result of the bearing of the supporting stop (20) on different supporting shoulders in the first toothed quadrant (18), brings about an adjustment of the capsule yarn brake. The adjustment of a plurality of capsule yarn brakes takes place simultaneously from a central control device by means of compressed-air pulses transmitted via a common compressed-air conduit.
