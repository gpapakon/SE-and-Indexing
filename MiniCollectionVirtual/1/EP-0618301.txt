<ABSTRACT>
Device for injecting preheated air into a shaft furnace consisting of a number of separate tubular components (10, 12) including an external armouring (18) made of steel and an internal lining made of cast refractory concrete (2), connected in pairs by a spherical joint and a compensator (16). The spherical joint (14) includes a convex ball (24) integrally attached to a first tubular component and capable of pivoting in a concave socket (26) integrally attached to a second tubular component. At least the convex ball (24) of the spherical joint includes a profiled refractory brick (28) anchored in the interior refractory lining (20) made of cast refractory concrete.

Device for blowing preheated air into a shaft
furnace, comprising a first and second tubular

element (10, 12), each fitted with an outer
shielding (18) made of refractory steel and with an

inner refractory lining made of cast refractory
concrete (20), the two tubular elements (10, 12) being

connected by a ball joint (14) and a compensator (16),
and the said ball joint (14) including a convex

pivot (24) which is integral with the first tubular
element and which can pivot in a concave dish (26)

integral with a second tubular element, characterized
in that at least the convex pivot (24) of the ball

joint comprises a profiled refractory brick (28)
anchored in the inner refractory lining (20) made of

cast refractory concrete.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a sheath (30) made of refractory steel extends up

to the convex part of the pivot (24) and terminates in
a projecting lip (32) which forms a bearing surface for

the profiled refractory brick (28).
Device according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the radius of curvature of the

ball joint (14) is of the order of magnitude of the
external radius of the two tubular elements (10, 12).
Device according to any one of Claims 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the concave dish (26) of the

joint (14) comprises a profiled refractory brick
anchored in the inner refractory lining (20).
Device according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that an insulating jacket (44) is interposed between

the refractory brick (28) and the refractory steel
sheath (30).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the refractory concrete in which

the profiled brick (28) is anchored forms a single
piece with the refractory lining (20) of the first

tubular element. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the pivot (24) constitutes a

separate element mounted on the tubular element (10)
and separated from the inner refractory lining of the

latter by an annular seal (36).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that refractory seals (40, 42) are

attached on the shielding (18) of the second tubular
element (12) and on the edge of the concave dish (26).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the refractory seal is partially

attached in a housing (39) inside the tubular element
and partially on the refractory.
