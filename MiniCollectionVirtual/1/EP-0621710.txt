<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for intermixing circuit and
packet data on a shared transmission medium. With

this invention, the history of gaps between transmitted
circuit frames is used to predict future gap

sizes. If the size of a predicted gap is larger
than the size of a frame of packet data to be

transmitted, then the packet data is inserted in
the next gap. If a circuit data frame arrives

before the completion of transmission of a packet
frame, the circuit data will be stored in an

insertion buffer until completion of transmission
of the packet frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the intermixing of
circuit and packet switching data in a fast circuit
switching environment. More specifically, the history of
gaps between transmitted circuit frames is used to predict
the size of the next gap that will exist between transmitted
circuit frames. If the size of the predicted gap is
larger than the size of a frame of packet data to be transmitted,
then the frame of packet data is inserted in the
next gap. If the gap is smaller than anticipated, the next
arriving circuit frame will be stored in a buffer until
completion of the transmitted packet frame.In a fast circuit switching environment, a circuit path (or
connection) is established between the input port and the
output port of a switch fabric for both packet-switched and
circuit-switched traffic. A circuit in the switch fabric
is disconnected right after a frame is transmitted for
packet-switched traffic. On the other hand, the established
circuit remains intact for the duration of a circuit
connection for circuit-switched traffic. In certain applications
such as multimedia or file transfers, video or
image frames require large blocks of data to be partitioned
into smaller packets (â‰¤2K bytes) before they are transmitted
through the network. Assuming the data is compressed
and carried by a gigabit data link, long pauses can
usually be found in between the transmitted frames. Therefore,
it is desirable that a circuit for a circuit-switched
data stream can be disconnected momentarily during unused
interval so that packet-switched traffic destined for the
same output port can be intermixed. This intermixing is
important in order to allow a port to receive both circuit-Switched 
and packet-switched traffic simultaneously while
minimizing the possible delay or jitter for circuit-switched
traffic. On the other hand, it is desirable to reduce the
overhead associated with breaking an old connection and
establishing a new connection each time a frame in a packet-switched
data stream needs to be transmitted, as compared to a
pure circuit-switched environment.R. Grunefelder, J.P. Cosmas, S. Manthrope, and A. Odinma-Okafor,
