<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an operating device for electrical lamps. The connecting part on the mains side is provided with a strain-relief device (2,3) for two connecting cables (4, 5). It consists of a base part (2) which is integrally designed with the housing (1) and of a reversible bracket (3), between which the connecting cables (4,5) are clamped. The differently structured surfaces (30, 31) of the bracket (3) permit different types of cable to be fitted in the strain-relief device (2,3).

<CLAIMS>
Operating device for electric lamps, comprising
a housing (1), an electric circuit which is arranged in

the interior of the housing (1), a lamp-side connecting
part (8) for connecting at least one electric lamp to the

operating device, and a line-side connecting part (7) for
connecting the operating device to an electric voltage

source, it being the case that

at least the line-side connecting part (7) has a
stress relief device (2, 3) with two bushings for

connection cables (4, 5),
the stress relief device (2, 3) comprises a base
part (2), rigidly connected to the housing (1), and

a bracket (3),
the base part (2) and the bracket (3) have cooperating
surfaces (20; 30) provided with depressions

(20a, 20b; 30a, 30b) and between which the connection
cable(s) (4) can be clamped,
the bushings are formed in each case by a depression
(20a, 30a; 20b, 30b) in the cooperating surfaces

(20; 30) of the base part (2) and the bracket (3),

characterized in that the bracket (3) has at least two
differently structured surfaces (30; 31) provided with

depressions (30a, 30b; 31a, 31b) so that the surface
(20), provided with the depressions (20a, 20b), of the

base part (2) can optionally cooperate with one of these
surfaces (30; 31) of the bracket (3), depending on the

shape, the transverse dimensions and the number of the
connection cables (4, 5) to be guided through or of the

connection cable to be guided through, so that the 
surface (31) with the depression (31a) can act as a

support.
Operating device for electric lamps according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the depressions (20a, 20b)

in the surface (20) of the base part (2) are arranged in
a plane, and the first surface (30) of the bracket (3),

which is provided with two depressions (30a, 30b) lying
in a plane, cooperates with the surface (20) of the base

part (2), so that the depressions (20a, 30a; 20b, 30b)
form two bushings of equal size for the connection cables

(4, 5), and the connection cables (4, 5) can be clamped
between the first surface (30) of the bracket (3) and the

surface (20) of the base part (2).
Operating device for electric lamps according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the depressions (20a, 20b)

in the surface (20) of the base part (2) are arranged in
a plane, and the second surface (31) of the bracket (3),

which is provided with two depressions (31a, 31b) lying
in different planes extending parallel to one another,

cooperates with the surface (20) of the base part (2), so
that the depressions (20a, 31a; 20b, 31b) form two bushings

of different size for the connection cables (4, 5),
and the connection cables (4, 5) can be clamped between

the second surface (31) of the bracket (3) and the
surface (20) of the base part (2).
Operating device for electric lamps according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the base part (2) and the

bracket (3) are interconnected by means of a screw (6).
