<ABSTRACT>
The assembly constitutes a medical pump, particularly a portable micropump for parenteral administration of medicinal solutions and comprises a first module (2) with reservoir (8) arranged to co-operate with a second motor module (4), pump operation being assured by assembly of the two modules. The first module (2) has a removable sterilizing filter device (3) fitted to the reservoir filler orifice (10), with septum, and incorporating a sterile filter pellet (25) and a needle (28) surrounded by a flexible sleeve (29). A support arm (33) comprises a guiding element (34) to guide said device (3) on perforation of the septum, and a securing unit (40) closing the housing (39) for the second module (4). The first module (2) with said device (3) is in the form of a sterile hermetic package. The assembly offers ease of use and ensures that aseptic conditions are maintained when filling the reservoir (8).

A portable medical pump assembly for the parenteral administration
of medicinal solutions, comprising a first module (2) provided

with a storage reservoir (8) for the medicinal solution, an
inlet (10) for said reservoir and an outlet (11) to take said medicinal

solution outside the pump, said first module (2) being arranged
to cooperate with a second module (4) provided with a motor

and pumping means, the functioning of the pump being provided for
by the assembly of said first and second modules, characterized in

that it comprises a removable sterilizing filtering device (3) and
a support member (24) having a support arm (33), the latter having

at a first end a fastening member (40) designed for anchoring removably
on the first module (2) and, at a second end, a retention

member (34) designed for retaining in place the removable sterilizing
filtering device (3) such that the latter be connected removably

to the filling inlet (10).
An assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the
fastening member is comprised of an anchoring housing (40) arranged

so that it can be introduced into a housing (39) of the first
module, this housing being designed for receiving a protruding

part (50) of the second module (4) upon its assembling on the
first module (2),
An assembly according to claim 2, characterized in that the
support member (24) comprises a cover (37) designed for closing

the opening (38) of said housing (39). 
An assembly according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that
the pumping means are of the peristaltic type including flexible

tubings (12, 13) arranged in said housing (39) of the first module
(2), the anchoring housing (40) including at least one member (55)

designed for maintaining in place the tubings (12, 13).
An assembly according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the filling inlet (10) is of the septum type (20) and the

removable sterilizing filtering device (3) consists of a sterile
filtering pellet (25) including, on the one hand, a connector (26)

and, on the other hand, a needle (28) designed for traversing the
septum (20) and in that the retaining member is comprised of a

guiding piece (34) designed for ensuring an axial sliding of the
removable sterilizing filtering device (3) for the piercing of the

septum (20) by the needle (28).
An assembly according to claim 5, characterized in that the
removable sterilizing filtering device (3) comprises a support

(30) for the needle (28) and a resilient protective sleeve (29)
connecting the support (30) to a connector (31) of the filling

port (10).
An assembly according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that
the support member (24) is provided with a housing in which at

least one needle (28) of the removable sterilizing filtering device
(3) or the latter in its entirety, can be disposed after the

filling of the reservoir (8).
An assembly according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the filling port is of the nonreturn valve type (56) and

the removable sterilizing filtering device (3) consists of a sterile
filtering pellet (25) carrying, on the one hand, a connector

(26) and, on the other hand, a watertight assembling means (60)
with the non return valve (56).
An assembly according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that the first module (2) and the removable sterilizing filtering

device (3) are made of materials which can be sterilized by
means of ethylene oxide and/or ionising radiations.
An assembly according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that the first module (2) provided with a removable sterilizing

filtering device (3) is provided separately from the second module
(4) in a sealed envelope (1) of a material which can be sterilized

by means of ethylene oxide and/or of ionising radiations.
An assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that once
the removable sterilizing filtering device and the support element

(24) are removed from their initial position after the filling of
the storage reservoir (8), said filling inlet (10) is made non accessible

to the user by the assembling of the first (2) and of the
second (4) modules.
