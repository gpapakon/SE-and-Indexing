<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of determining 
a short-circuit inductance in an asynchronous 
machine, wherein the short-circuit inductance is 
determined from a stator voltage and the time derivative of a stator 
current of the machine. Control of an asynchronous machine usually aims 
at a desired behaviour of the torque created by the 
machine when the current and voltage supplied to the 
machine are known. One thus attempts to affect the 
electric torque, the relative value of which as a 
function of the stator flux and stator current is: 
T = (ψsxis),  
where 
T =electric torque, ψs =stator flux, and  i s = stator current.  Proper torque control thus requires that not 
only the current is but also the stator flux of the 
machine or a parameter proportional to it (such as 
the rotor or air gap flux) is known. Methods for calculating the stator flux are 
based on the well-known differential and current 
equations of the stator and rotor of an asynchronous 
machine, which are as follows in the coordinate 
system of the stator: 
us = Rsis + dψsdt0 = Rrir + dψrdt- jωmψrψs = Lsis + Lmirψr = Lrir + Lmis 
where 
ψr =rotor flux, ir =rotor current, us =stator voltage, Rs =stator resistance, Rr =rotor resistance, Ls =stator inductance, Lr =rotor inductance, Lm =primary inductance, and ωm =mechanical rotation rate. The object is to calculate the stator flux by 
means of the measured stator current and stator voltage, 
and so the rotor flux and rotor current have to 
be eliminated from the above equations. Using Eq. 4 
and 5, the rotor flux and rotor current are first 
solved as a function of the stator flux and stator 
current: 
ψr = LrLm (ψs - σLsis) ir = 1Lm (ψs - Lsis),   
 
where 
σ = 1 - L2mLsLr = dispersion coefficient,  
and 
σLs = short-circuit inductance. Using Eq. 6 and 7, Eq. 2 and 3 are reduced into 
the following form: 
dψsdt = us - Rsisdψsdt= σLsdisdt - 1τr (ψs - Lsis) + jωm(ψs - σLsis),  
where 
τr = LrRr = rotor time constant. Most prior art stator flux calculation methods 
utilize either Eq. 8 or Eq. 9 or both of them. When 
using Eq. 8 alone, it is not possible to effect 
proper control at very low frequencies, wherefore the 
best methods always use either Eq. 9 or both 
equations. One crucial parameter required in Eq. 9 is the 
short-circuit inductance. To deduce one method for 
calculating it, the derivative of the rotor flux is 
discussed first, which is on the basis of Eq. 2 and 
6:  
 
Introducing Eq. 10 into Eq. 3 gives: 
σLsdisdt = us+uo,  
where uo is a voltage depending on the
