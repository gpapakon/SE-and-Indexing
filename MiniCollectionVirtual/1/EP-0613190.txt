<ABSTRACT>
This invention has as its object to easily obtain a MESFET 
free from output distortion. For this purpose, in this 

invention, an n⁺-type layer (4) is formed at a substrate 
position spaced apart from a gate electrode (7) by a 

distance of a side-etch amount L
g-n+
. The n⁺-type layer (4) 
has an impurity concentration and thickness such that a 

surface depletion layer generated depending on a surface 
level on the drain-side does not almost extend to the 

drain-side. An n'-type layer (5) as an intermediate 
concentration layer has an impurity concentration and 

thickness such that a drain-side end portion of a channel 
depletion layer generated upon applying a voltage to the 

gate electrode (7) extends to the drain-side with an 
increase in this applied voltage. Moreover, the n⁺-type 

layer (4), a distance L
g-n+
, and the n'-type layer (5) are 
formed to have a relationship in which a ratio of an 

extension length L of the drain-side end portion of the 
channel depletion layer from the drain-side end portion A 

of the gate electrode (7) to the drain-side, to a gate 
length L
g
 falls within a predetermined range. Therefore, 
according to this invention, the long gate effect and the 

effect for the drain current in accordance with the square 
characteristics cancel each other, and an FET output 

changes linearly in response to an input.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Schottky junction 
type field effect transistor (MESFET) in which a gate 
electrode Schottky-contacts a semiconductor substrate, 
and a method of manufacturing the same. As a conventional MESFET of this type, a MESFET 
using a GaAs semiconductor material is known. GaAs 
MESFETs have been used in a variety of fields such as 
high-frequency elements and ultra high-speed ICs. In 
applications of GaAs MESFET to these high-frequency 
elements and ultra high-speed ICs, GaAs MESFET 
characteristics are advantageous in that an output signal 
is less distorted in response to an input signal. The voltage vs. current characteristics of a MESFET 
generally have so-called square characteristics, and its 
drain current Ids is defined as follows:

Ids = K(Vth - Vg)²   (1) 


 
where K is the proportional constant, Vth is the threshold 
voltage, and Vg is the gate voltage. Typical square characteristics are shown in a graph 
of Fig. 1. The abscissa of this graph represents the gate  
 
voltage Vg, and the ordinate represents the drain current 
Ids or a transconductance gm. A solid characteristic curve 
represents the square characteristics represented by 
equation (1). The ordinate corresponding to this 
characteristic curve represents the current Ids shown on 
the left side of Fig. 1. A dotted characteristic curve 
represents a change in transconductance with respect to a 
change in voltage of the FET gate voltage having these 
square characteristics. The ordinate corresponding to 
this characteristic curve represents the 
transconductance gm shown on the right side of Fig. 1. As 
shown in this graph, a change in drain current Ids 
exhibits the square characteristics as a function of a 
change in gate voltage Vg. The drain current Ids as an 
output signal does not change linearly and is distorted 
with respect to the gate voltage Vg as an input signal. 
This characteristic curve must be linear if the FET 
characteristics are less distorted. To change the square characteristics linearly, i.e., 
to reduce the distortion caused in the output, there is 
proposed a structure in which an impurity doping profile 
in an active layer must be changed stepwise or gradually 
(graded distribution) from a conventional uniform 
distribution. An FET having the stepwise impurity 
profile of an active layer is disclosed in, for example, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,163,984. This prior art describes an  
 
impurity profile in which an impurity is doped from a 
substrate surface to a predetermined depth at a
