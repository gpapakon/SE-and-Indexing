<ABSTRACT>
A system for enabling the acquisition from outside the 
body of a patient (10) of data pertaining to a medical 

device (14) implanted therein. A characterization tag (90) is 
secured to the medical device (14) prior to the implantation 

thereof. The characterization tag (90) is powered by energy 
absorbed through the mutual inductive coupling of 

circuitry (398) in the characterization tag (90) with an 
alternating magnetic field (204) generated outside the body of 

the patient (10). That circuitry (398) in the 
characterization tag (90) is selectively loaded and unloaded 

in a predetermined sequence of loading conditions that 
correspond to data about the implanted medical device (14). 

The alternating magnetic field (204) is generated in a 
characterization probe (60) moveable external to the body of 

the patient (10). The characterization probe (60) includes 
electrical circuitry (420) for sensing variations in the 

amount of energy absorbed from the field (204) by the 
circuitry (398) in the characterization tag (90). The 

characterization tag (90) is secured in a characterization tag 
recess (106) on the exterior of the medical device (14) by a 

biocompatible potting material (104). If the medical device is 
assembled from a plurality of constituent parts, the 

characterization tag (90) may be permanently captured between 
a pair of those parts. Two single fluid reservoir access  

 
ports (14,230), a double fluid reservoir access port (280), 
a 
septum-free access port (320), and a prosthetic hip 

joint (370) are disclosed as examples of devices with which 
the system may be employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems, devices, and methods 
for enabling the acquisition from outside the body of a 
patient of data pertaining to medical devices implanted 
therein. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
a system in which an implanted medical device, such as an 
infusion port or a prosthetic implant, may be identified or 
otherwise characterized by data obtained from outside the body 
of a patient using a hand-held medical device characterization 
probe. The medical use of implantable devices in human patients 
is steadily increasing. In addition, due to technological 
advances in implantable medical devices, the implanted 
duration of the residency of such devices is also lengthening. Examples of such implantable medical devices include 
artificial heart valves, prosthetic joints, vascular grafts, 
artificial ligaments and tendons, urinary and gastrointestinal 
tract sphincters, vena cava blood filters, penal implants and 
other tissue expanders, fistula and hernia repair devices, 
implantable infusion ports with associated long term 
catheters, defibrillator catheters, demand pacer heart leads,  
 
as well as nonpassive implantable devices, such as artificial 
hearts, pacemakers, and medicament pumps. As the use of this wide variety of implanted devices 
becomes more common and frequent, certain associated problems 
can be anticipated. That to which the present invention is 
directed relates to ascertaining the identity of such devices 
after the implantation thereof, or to obtaining other 
characterizing data about the implanted devices. Reasons for 
needing such an identification or such data will be discussed 
below, along with some of the constraints imposed by medical 
practices on the process of doing so. The very reason for the installation of an implantable 
medical devices is to provide for a repeated function that is 
required by the body of the patient on the long term basis. 
Thus, medical devices are implanted, so that the 
accomplishment of such functions does not require excessively 
frequent therapy procedures. In some cases, such as with a 
prosthetic implant or a demand pacer heart lead, the medical 
device installed provides a function required on a continuous 
basis. The implantation of any such devices, however, causes 
significant trauma to the patient. Thus, once implanted, 
there is a accordingly an incentive to avoid reaccessing such 
devices through any surgical reopening of the body of the 
patient.  Some implanted medical devices, such as
