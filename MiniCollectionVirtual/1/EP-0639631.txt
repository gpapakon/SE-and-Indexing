<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of synthesis gas from
plastic wastes, which comprises thermally cracking

the wastes predominantly to give liquid products and
transforming the liquid cracking products by partial

oxidation into synthesis gas.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
thermal cracking is carried out at temperatures

between 250 and 450째C, using an auxiliary phase
liquid at the reaction temperature.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
liquid auxiliary phase is composed of the liquid

degradation products of the plastic wastes.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
3, wherein the thermal cracking is carried out in

the presence of catalysts.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
4, wherein, in particular, if chlorine-containing

plastic wastes are present, the thermal cracking is
carried out in two or more stages, the temperature

increasing from stage to stage and, by choice of the
temperature, the majority of the hydrogen chloride

resulting as a cracking product being formed in the
first stage.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, wherein the partial oxidation of the liquid

cracking products is carried out at temperatures
between 1100 and 1500째C and at a pressure of 1 to

10 MPa.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
6, wherein the partial oxidation is conducted in

such a way via the amount of oxygen added that about 
0.1 to about 0.3% by weight of soot is formed, based

on the liquid cracking products.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
7, wherein the crude gas leaving the gasification

reactor is first cooled in a radiant cooler to 500
to 1000째C and is then cooled in a convection cooler

to 150 to 300째C.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
8, wherein the cooled gas is scrubbed with water and

the ash suspended in the scrubbing water is thereupon
separated off.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
9, wherein the purified gae is fed to a membrane

filter unit to establish a desired CO/H
2
 ratio.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
9, wherein the purified gas is fed to a converter.
