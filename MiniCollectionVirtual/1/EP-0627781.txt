<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a passive filter consisting of two substrates (1, 2) made of electrically insulating material, these being covered one each face with conductive layers, one face of which is screen printed in order to constitute a plurality (411, 417) of mutually parallel conductive microstrip lines, all the ends of which are joined together by one and the same edge to the earth plane formed by the opposite face (3) of the substrate (1, 2) which is uniformly covered with conductive metal, the two substrates (1, 2) being arranged, with screen-printed faces facing each other, separated from each other by a defined distance by a metal spacer (6), characterised in that at least one of the substrates (1, 2) includes single lines for coupling and for matching between microstrip lines, and in that a first spacer element (64) is arranged according to each line of symmetry of each strip (411 to 417) contributing to the formation of a resonator.
