<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyphenylene ether 
resin composition. In more detail, the present invention 
relates to a thermoplastic composition which is improved in 
molding processability, solvent-resistancy, oil-resistancy 
and impact-resistancy, which is characterized in that 
modified aromatic hydrocarbon-formaldehyde resin, rubber-like 
polymer and polyamide resin are formulated with a 
polyphenylene ether resin. The polymer composition of the present invention can 
be utilized in a wide variety of fields, such as electronic 
and electric components, automotive components, mechanical 
components, architectural components, and household 
commodities. Polyphenylene ether resins are excellent in thermal 
properties, mechanical properties and electric properties, 
but are difficult to mold, because of their high melt 
processing temperature and small flowability. Further, 
polyphenylene ether polymers have excellent resistance to 
inorganic reagent, such as acid and alkali, however, 
polyphenylene ether resin is caused to melt or swell by 
organic solvents, such as acetone, toluene and halogen  
 
hydrocarbons, and, is poor in solvent-resistance and oil-resistance. 
Various approaches to overcoming these 
problems are proposed. In Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho. 52-3826, for 
the purpose of improving molding properties, a resin 
composition comprising polyphenylene ether resin and 
aromatic hydrocarbon-formaldehyde resin or the modified 
resin is described. In Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho. 52-3827, for 
the purpose of improving molding properties and impact 
resistance, a resin composition comprising polyphenylene 
ether resin and aromatic hydrocarbon-formaldehyde resin or 
the modified resin, and a rubber-like polymer is described. However, in these compositions, solvent resistance, 
oil resistance and impact resistance are not sufficient. In Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho. 60-11966, for 
the purpose of improving solvent-resistance, a method of 
adding a compound which has a specific structure, such as 
maleic anhydride, maleimide and fumaric acid, to a polyphenylene 
ether resin and polyamide resin as a 
compatibilizer and melt-mixing is described. Further, in Japanese Patent Publication (Toku-Hyo-Sho) 
No. 61-502195, a method of adding citrate or malic acid to 
a polyphenylene ether resin and polyamide resin as a 
compatibilizer and melt-mixing is described.  However, a composition obtained from these methods is 
not sufficient in impact resistance, and further, a part of
