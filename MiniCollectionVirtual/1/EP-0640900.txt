<ABSTRACT>
Cycle machining can 
be easily performed in a 

good precision by controlling 
machines for machining 

a prototype and other 
products. The operator inputs 

graphic data such as 
of circular and rectangular 

figures through a keyboard 
or the like conversationally 

in accordance with the 
guidance appearing on a 

display (16). Graphic data 
storage means (1) stores the 

graphic data thus inputted. 
Transformation means (2) 

calculates the machining 
paths which are required 

for the cycle machining, 
and transforms the graphic 

data into NC instructions. 
NC instruction storage 

means (3) stores the NC instructions. 
Interpolation 

means (4) outputs interpolating 
pulse signals for moving tools along the machining paths of the cycle machining according to the pulse signals output from 

a manual pulse generator and jog feed buttons on a machine operation board (40). Thus, it is possible for the operator to execute 
a cycle machining easily and exactly while confirming the machining condition by operating the machine operation board (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical
control apparatus and a numerical control method for controlling
a machine tool, and more particularly to a numerical
control apparatus and a numerical control method for
controlling a machine tool which machines prototypes or the
like.Advances in the technology of numerically controlled
machine tools have been so great that they can
machine workpieces of complex shape at high speed with
precision. At present, workpieces of complex shape cannot
be machined without numerically controlled machine tools.To generate machining programs, there are widely
used interactive numerical control apparatus which comprise
a numerical control apparatus with an interactive program
generating function, and automatic programming apparatus
for simply generating complex machining programs.In the use of such numerical control apparatus,
it is necessary to accurately define machine coordinates, a
machine origin, program coordinates, a machining origin,
and other data for generating strict machining programs. 
The interactive numerical control apparatus and the automatic
programming apparatus can be used to machine a
number of workpieces.For some machining processes for producing a
prototype or a model, general-purpose milling machines,
lathes, and the like are used which require a short period
of time to carry out preparatory action such as attachment
and detachment of workpieces, installation of tools, etc.,
and does not require machining programs to be generated.
Machining on such machines or lathes has been carried out
solely at the discretion of the operator.Problems of general-purpose machine tools are
that the number of available operators who can handle
general-purpose machine tools is becoming smaller, and it
is difficult for the general-purpose machine tools to carry
out oblique linear machining, arcuate machining, or the
like though they can effect linear machining without any
problem.If, on the other hand, a general numerically
controlled machine tool is used to machine a prototype or a
model, then it is necessary to accurately define machine
coordinates, a machine origin, program coordinates, a
machining origin, and other data. While it is not impossible
to define those data, the required programming process
is too time-consuming and troublesome for machining a
portion of a single workpiece.To solve the above problems, the applicant has 
filed Japanese patent application No. 4-231836 on a numerical
control apparatus which employs a general-purpose
machine tool for
