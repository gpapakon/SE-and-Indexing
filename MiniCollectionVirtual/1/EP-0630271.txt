<DESCRIPTION>
 "POWDER NEBULIZER APPARATUS AND METHOD OFNEBULIZATION"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a powder nebulization method and a powder nebulizer apparatus useÎ± in respiratory therapy and, in particular, to a continuously connected, continuous flow powder nebulizer useful in respiratory therapy to deliver powdered medications.Description of the Related ArtCritically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation are often victims of respiratory distress syndrome, status asthmaticus and pulmonary infections. Treatment of these and other severe respiratory conditions includes medications delivered directly to the lungs of the patient.Respiratory delivery of medication for these conditions is preferable to oral, intravenous and subcutaneous delivery because it is non-invasive, permits rapid action of medicant, requires a relatively small dosage, is not filtered through the liver of the patient, and produces a low incidence of systemic side effects.Nebulized or aerosolized solutions are the preferred method of respiratory delivery of medication; when fragmented into small particles, medicants are more efficiently deposited near sites of medicant activity in the lung. 

 Respiratory medications may be delivered to the lungs of the patient as an aerosol of a liquid or a powder. Clinical aerosols are currently generated by jet or ultrasonic nebulizers, metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powdered inhalers.There are two types of nebulizers for the delivery of liquid medication to the lungs: jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers. In conventional jet nebulizers, compressed gas from a compressor or hospital air line is passed through a narrow constriction know as a jet. This creates an area of low pressure, and liquid medication from a reservoir is drawn up through a feed tube and fragmented into droplets by the airstream. Only the smallest drops leave the nebulizer directly, while the majority impact on baffles and walls and are returned to the reservoir. Consequently, jet nebulization takes several minutes to complete, depending upon the initial volume.Important disadvantages of nebulizers include low lung deposition related to the use of tidal breathing. A substantial portion of the dose used in a jet nebulizer is retained permanently as a dead or residual volume on baffles and internal walls of the nebulizer chamber and cannot be released. Generally only 2-10% of the dose placed in the nebulizer ever reaches the lung. The consequences are a higher drug dosage and
