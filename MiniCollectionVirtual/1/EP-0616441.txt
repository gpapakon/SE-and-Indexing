<ABSTRACT>
This system for reestablishing the quality of transmission of a link including amplifiers, in the event of failure of one or several of these amplifiers includes:   - associated with at least one of the said amplifiers (10i), means (13i) for controlling the gain of this amplifier with a view to compensating for a degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio on reception, consequent on a failure of at least one other amplifier, - at the sending end of the said link, error-corrector coding means (4) and, at the receiving end of this link, error-corrector decoding means (9), the said error-corrector code making it possible to reduce, or even to suppress, the residual error rate on reception, related to the residual degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio on reception, which is not compensated for by the said gain control.

<CLAIMS>
System for re-establishing the transmission quality of a digital information
transmission link including amplifier equipments in the event of failure of one or

more amplifier equipments, including:

associated with at least one of said amplifier equipments (10
i
), means (13
i
) for
varying the gain of said amplifier equipment in order to compensate for

deterioration of the receive signal-to-noise ratio following failure of at least one
other amplifier equipment,
error corrector coding means (4) at the send end of said link operating on the

digital information to be transmitted and error corrector decoding means (9) at
the receive end of said link operating on the received digital information, the

error corrector code used by said error corrector coding means and by said error
corrector decoding means being adapted to reduce or even eliminate residual

errors at the receive end associated with residual deterioration of the receive
signal-to-noise ratio not compensated by varying the gain.
System according to claim 1 further including, associated with at least one of
said amplifier equipments, means (14
i
, 14'
i
, 15
i
) for disconnecting said amplifier
equipment from said link in the event of failure of said amplifier equipment.
