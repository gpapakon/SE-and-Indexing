<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a chemical 
reaction for preparing polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactants, 
whereby the content of undesirable fatty acid contaminants is 
reduced or substantially eliminated. The preparation of polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactants 
by the reaction of fatty esters with N-alkylamino polyols is of 
considerable commercial interest. However, the resulting 
N-alkylamido polyol reaction products, such as the fatty acid 
N-methyl glucamides, are often contaminated with residual nascent 
sources of fatty acids. Contamination by such materials may be 
tolerable if the user can afford to purify the polyhydroxy fatty 
acid amides prior to use. Or, as a possible alternative, the user 
presumably could arrange for special care to be taken during the 
reaction in order to minimize the levels of nascent sources of 
fatty acids. However, the manufacturer of high volume, low-cost 
chemicals such as detersive surfactants can ill-afford special 
handling techniques or materials which require expensive 
purification steps. For example, the manufacturer of high sudsing 
detergent compositions which contain polyhydroxy fatty acid amide 
surfactants (e.g., C8-C22 fatty acid amide derivatives of N-methyl 
glucamine or N-methyl fructamine) requires an inexpensive source 
of such materials which have desirable low fatty acid levels, 
since such fatty acids (especially C14, and higher chain lengths) 
can substantially reduce sudsing. Indeed, the manufacturer of 
high sudsing, high cleaning dishwashing liquids which are 
formulated to contain calcium and/or magnesium cations is also 
especially concerned with having a source of surfactants which 
contain little or no nascent fatty acids, due to the prospective  
 
formation of "curd" by the reaction of such cations with fatty 
acids which may contaminate the formulations. The present invention solves the problem of contamination by 
nascent sources of fatty acids associated with the manufacture of 
5 polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, and thereby affords access to a 
high quality supply of this class of surfactants. The following references are instructive: U.S. Patents 
1,985,424, issued December 25, 1934; 2,016,962, issued October 8, 
1935; and 2,703,798, issued March 8, 1955. GB-A 883 733, published on 6th December 1961, describes a 
reaction for the preparation of fatty acid bis(hydroxyalkyl) 
amide, the fatty acid amide having low impurity content i.e. 
low contents of fatty acid ester and free amines.

A process for preparing a reaction product comprising 
a polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactant, 

said process comprising a primary reaction 
between a polyhydroxy amine and a fatty acid ester, said primary 

reaction being carried out at a temperature below 100°C so as to 
minimize formation of cyclized by-products in said reaction 

product, characterized by running 
the primary reaction under substantially water-free conditions, 

whereby the formation of free fatty acids and soaps is minimized, 
and adding to said primary reaction product an amine reactant 

which is a member selected from the group consisting of 
ammonia, short-chain alkyl amines, hydroxyalkyl amines, and 

subjecting said reaction product to a secondary reaction, whereby 
the total level of residual nascent and free fatty acid present in 

said secondary reaction product is reduced to below 1%, by weight.

product is prepared by a primary reaction of a C

A process according to Claim 2, wherein the fatty acid ester 
is a methyl ester, and said primary reaction is carried out in the 

presence of a base catalyst. 
A process according to Claim 3, wherein the primary reaction 
is carried out in a hydroxy solvent in the presence of an alkoxide 

catalyst. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the amine reactant 
in said secondary reaction is a C

reactant is monoethanolamine, and wherein said secondary reaction

An improved process according to Claim 1 for preparing 
polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactants characterized by: 


(a) a primary amidation reaction conducted under 
substantially water-free conditions between a fatty acid 

5 ester and a sugar-derived polyhydroxyamine to prepare a 
polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactant which is 

contaminated with residual nascent fatty acids, followed 
by; 
(b) a secondary reaction Which comprises admixing and 
reacting with the reaction product of primary reaction 

(a) an amine reactant, whereby the level of residual 
nascent fatty acids and free fatty acids is lowered to 

below 0.5% by weight in the final surfactant. 
A process according to Claim 7 wherein said amine reactant 
used in step (b) is a member selected from the group consisting of 

monoethanolamine and 1-amino-2-propanol. 
A process according to claim 1 comprising the additional

preparing a detergent composition, said detergent composition 

comprising the polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactant reaction 
product which is substantially free of said residual fatty

thereof,
 
whereby undesirable interactions between said calcium or 

magnesium ions and said residual fatty acid are minimised. 
A process according to Claim 9 wherein said detergent composition 
is characterized by being in liquid form and contains at 

least 0.10% by weight of added calcium ion, magnesium ions, or 
mixtures thereof and less than 1.0%, preferably less than 0.1%, by 

weight of residual fatty acid or nascent fatty acids.
