<ABSTRACT>
In a printing machine having a back pressure cylinder (1) and a plurality of printing units, the bearings of the format cylinders (6) and the inking unit stands with the screen rollers (2) can be moved on guides of the printing machine frame (3) approximately radially relative to the back pressure cylinder. The drive of the format cylinders (6) and of the screen rollers (2) is derived from a central drive. In order to provide a simple continuous running drive for the inking unit rollers, the screen rollers (2) are connected in terms of drive to the central drive by means of a free wheel (3). Provided for the screen rollers (2) which can be disengaged from the format cylinders (6) is a continuous running drive which consists of a toothed belt (4) which is driven by a servo motor (20) and is wrapped around all the driving gears (24) of the screen rollers. The strands (25) of the toothed belt run parallel to the strands (26, 27) of the toothed belt which envelope the respectively radially outer deflection wheels (15) in the manner of a loop. The inking roller stands can likewise be moved on their guides parallel to the mutually parallel strands (25-27) of the toothed belt.

Printing machine, preferably flexographic printing 
machine, with an impression cylinder (1) and with a 

plurality of printing units, in which machine the 
mountings of the format cylinders (6) and the inking-unit 

trestles together with the engraved rollers (2) are 
movable on guides of the printing-machine stand (3) 

radially or virtually radially relative to the impression 
cylinder (1), and in which machine the drive for the 

format cylinders (6) and for the engraved rollers (2) is 
derived from a central drive, preferably a central wheel 

(1), the engraved rollers (2) being drive-connected to 
the central drive or the central wheel (36) via a freewheel 

(33), and a run-on drive being provided for the 
engraved rollers (2) movable away from the format cylinders 

(6), characterized in that the run-on drive consists 
of a chain or toothed belt (4) which is driven by a 

servomotor (19, 20) and which is slung in a loop-like 
manner round all the driving gearwheels (24) of the 

engraved rollers (2) by being deflected via deflecting 
wheels (8-14, 7, 15), of which in each case three are 

arranged fixedly relative to the stand and in each case 
one (7) is arranged on the associated inking-unit or 

engraved-roller carriage, in such a way that the strands 
(25, 26) of the toothed belt (4) which run onto the 

deflecting wheels (7, 15), arranged radially outside the 
engraved-roller gearwheel (24) and off from these, and 

the strands (26, 27) of the toothed belt (4) which 
surround in a loop-like manner the respective radially 

outer deflecting wheels (15) extend parallel to one  
 

another; and in that the inking-roller trestles or the 
engraved rollers are likewise movable on their guides 

parallel to the mutually parallel strands (25, 26, 27) of 
the toothed belt (4). 
Printing machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in 
that the servomotor (20) drives the toothed belt 
(4) via a freewheel (37). 
Printing machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the engraved rollers (2) are driven 

by the central wheel (36) via the toothed belt (4) in 
that an intermediate gearwheel (33) meshes with the 

central wheel (36) and with a gearwheel (34) arranged on 
the driveshaft (31) for the toothed belt (4). 
Printing machine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the gearwheel (34) meshing with the intermediate 

gearwheel (33) is provided with the freewheel 
(33). 
Printing machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the driveshaft (31) for the 

toothed belt (4) is provided with a further gearwheel 
(38) which is provided with a freewheel (37) and which is 

drive-connected to the servomotor (20). 
Printing machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the format-cylinder gearwheels 

(40) mesh directly with the central wheel (36).
