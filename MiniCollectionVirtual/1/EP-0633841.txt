<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printhead is comprised of a lower body part (52) having a base section and a plurality of generally parallel spaced projections extending upwardly therefrom and an upper body part (54) having a top section and a corresponding plurality of generally parallel spaced projections extending downwardly therefrom. The top sides of the lower body projections (59) are conductively mounted to the bottom sides of the upper body projections (61) to form sidewalls which define a plurality of ink-carrying channels (70). Strips of a conductive adhesive (57) mount the lower and upper body projections together and a controller (80) is electrically connected to the strips to selectively impart either a positive, zero, or negative voltage to each strip. The lower body part (52) is formed using a piezoelectric material poled in a first direction (P1) generally perpendicular to the channels and the upper body part (54) is formed using a piezoelectric material also poled in the first direction (P2). By applying a positive voltage to a first strip of conductive adhesive and a negative voltage to an adjacent strip of conductive adhesive, first and second electric fields oppositely orientated to each other and normal to the direction of poling are produced in the lower and upper body projections which form first and second sidewalls for the channel, thereby causing the first and second sidewalls to deform in first and second channel expanding directions, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high density ink jet 
printhead and, more particularly, to a high density ink 
jet printhead having double-U actuators for firing ink-carrying 
channels axially extending therethrough. Printers provide a means of outputting a permanent 
record in human readable form. Typically, a printing 
technique may be categorized as either impact printing or 
non-impact printing. In impact printing, an image is 
formed by striking an inked ribbon placed near the 
surface of the paper. Impact printing techniques may be 
further characterized as either formed-character printing 
or matrix printing. In formed-character printing, the 
element which strikes the ribbon to produce the image 
consists of a raised mirror image of the desired 
character. In matrix printing, the character is formed  
 
as a series of closely spaced dots which are produced by 
striking a provided wire or wires against the ribbon. 
Here, characters are formed as a series of closely spaced 
dots produced by striking the provided wire or wires 
against the ribbon. By selectively striking the provided 
wires, any character representable by a matrix of dots 
can be produced. Non-impact printing is often preferred over impact 
printing in view of its tendency to provide higher 
printing speeds as well as its better suitability for 
printing graphics and half-tone images. Non-impact 
printing techniques include matrix, electrostatic and 
electrophotographic type printing techniques. In matrix 
type printing, wires are selectively heated by electrical 
pulses and the heat thereby generated causes a mark to 
appear on a sheet of paper, usually specially treated 
paper. In electrostatic type printing, an electric arc 
between the printing element and the conductive paper 
removes an opaque coating on the paper to expose a 
sublayer of a contrasting color. Finally, in 
electrophotographic printing, a photoconductive material 
is selectively charged utilizing a light source such as 
a laser. A powder toner is attracted to the charged 
regions and, when placed in contact with a sheet of 
paper, transfers to the paper's surface. The toner is 
then subjected to heat which fuses it to the paper. Another form of non-impact printing is generally 
classified as ink jet printing. Ink jet printing systems 
use the ejection of tiny droplets of ink to produce an 
image. The devices produce highly reproducible and 
controllable droplets, so that a droplet may be printed  
 
at a location specified by digitally stored image data.
