<ABSTRACT>
A circuit-breaking (disconnecting, interrupting) fuse for a capacitor incorporated in a container comprises a connection pin (1) with an intended isolation point (20). The connection pin (1) is attached to a pressure-dependent driving element, which consists of a diaphragm (8) which is attached to a baseplate (10). To support the circuit-breaking forces which act on the fuse cross-section (Q), prestressed springs (3) or spring washers are used, which are arranged centrically around the intended isolation point (20). For the application of high pulsed currents, electrical shunts are arranged, which comprise the slotted base of a spring housing (2) and/or radially arranged copper foil strips (9).

Electric capacitor which has an element stack and 
is built into a container, in particular made of metal, 

which has a safety disconnection device which in the 
event of a pressure rise in the container isolates the 

capacitor from an external circuit by virtue of the fact 
that a metallic conductor arranged in the interior of the 

container is interrupted at a design isolating point 
(20), and in which for the purpose of supporting the 

disconnection forces the safety disconnection device is 
preloaded by a preloaded spring element (3) via a 

pressure-dependent drive element which comprises a 
diaphragm (8), characterized in that the diaphragm (8) is 

mounted on a base plate (10) which rests on the upper 
surface of the element stack and which is connected 

electrically to an electrode of the capacitor, in that 
the design isolating point (20) is arranged in a terminal 

stud (1) which forms an external connection of the 
capacitor, and in that the preloaded spring element (3; 

18, 26) is arranged centrally around the design isolating 
point (20). 
Electric capacitor according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the spring element is a spring (3) which 

is arranged in a housing (2) having a slotted floor. 
Electric capacitor according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the preloading of the spring 

element (3; 18, 26) is performed by means of an adjusting 
nut (6). 
Electric capacitor according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the safety disconnection 

device or the pressure-dependent drive element is  
 

activated by means of a further adjusting nut (11) on the 
stud end. 
Electric capacitor according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that at least one electric shunt 

(2, 4) is arranged in parallel with the safety device 
cross-section (Q). 
Electric capacitor according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that a shunt (9) is arranged in 

parallel with the diaphragm.
