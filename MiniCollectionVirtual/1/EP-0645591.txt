<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a modular 
construction improved boiler for heating systems, 

which has been specifically designed for reducing the 
emission of polluting substances, which is 

characterized in that each boiler module comprises 
two side metal constructions (2), each of which comprises 

a closed gap (3), the side wall of which is provided with 
a plurality of fins (5). 
These constructions or assemblies (2) can be 
assembled to the sides of one or more intermediate 

metal assemblies, each of which comprises a further 
closed gap (3), the two side walls of which comprise a 

plurality of cooling fins (8), in order to provide 
suitable heat exchangers. 
On the top of these exchangers there are 
provided suitable combustion chambers (10) for burning 

therein a gaseous substance pre-mixed with air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
modular construction boiler, for heating systems, 
provided with a burner for burning an air-gas mixture, 
and which has been specifically designed for reducing 
the emission to atmosphere of polluting substances, 
such as nitrogen oxides and carbon oxides, and to 
provide an efficiency as high as possible with a 
condensing of the combustion products. There are already available on the market a 
plurality of types of boilers for heating systems, 
which operate by burning gaseous substances and by 
condensing the combustion products, as for example EP-A-0547641. Prior boilers of the above mentioned types have 
the drawback that they are greatly complex, from a 
constructional standpoint, and in particular with 
respect to the cooling systems inside the burner 
associated therewith, in order to reduce the 
admission of the polluting substances. Accordingly, the above prior boilers have a 
comparatively high cost, since they are constructed 
with production cycles requiring comparatively long 
times.  
 The document EP-A-0547641 discloses an improved modular construction boiler having essentially the features of the preamble of the main claim. Thus, the aim of the present invention is to 
overcome the above mentioned problems and drawbacks, 
by providing a heating system boiler , including an 
improved cooling system, and having a modular 
construction comprising elements which can be easily 
assembled to one another, so as to greatly reduce the 
making time and cost of the boiler. Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, a 
main object of the present invention is to provide 
such a boiler which is very competitive from a mere 
economic standpoint. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide such a boiler for heating systems which has a 
very low emission of polluting substances, with a 
very high thermal efficiency and condensing of the 
combustion products. Yet another object of the present invention is 
to provide such an improved boiler, for heating 
systems, which is very reliable and safe in 
operation. According to one aspect of the present 
invention, the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become more  
 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by an improved 
modular construction boiler for heating systems, 
particularly designed for reducing the emission of 
polluting substances, according to the main claim. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
present invention will become more apparent 
her
