<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive elements and more 
particularly to a method of forming images wherein the 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive element 
contains a matting agent. Finely divided materials with a mean particle 
size of from about 1 to about 10 micrometers are commonly 
used as matting agents to provide a rough surface to 
photographic elements. See, for example, U.S. Patents 
4,855,219 and 4,022,622. Further, U.S. Patents 4,396,706 
and 5,057,407 provide matte particles and techniques in 
order to increase the adhesion of the particles to the 
photographic element during processing of the element. 
In addition to the problems expressed in the previously 
recited references, printer dusting is also an 
objectionable problem associated with inadequate matte 
adhesion. The invention contemplates a photographic 
element having at least one light-sensitive layer on a 
support, the light-sensitive element containing a layer 
containing polymeric matte particles having a polymeric 
core surrounded by a layer of polymeric latex colloidal 
particles reactive with or having an affinity with 
gelatin. The matte particles or beads in accordance with 
this invention can be included in any layer of the 
photographic element, but preferably are included in the  
 
outermost surface of a light-sensitive silver halide 
photographic element, in a separate layer over the top 
surface of the photographic element (surface protecting 
layer) or in a layer in close proximity to the outermost 
layer so that the matte particles protrude above the 
surface of the outermost layer. The matte particles are 
included in a layer containing gelatin. The polymeric 
matte particles have a mean diameter ranging from about 
0.5 to about 10 micrometers and preferably from about 1 
to about 5 micrometers and most preferably from about 1 
to about 3.5 micrometers. Photographic elements in accordance with this 
invention demonstrate improved processing characteristics 
in modern rapid development apparatus with respect to 
matte adhesion, printer dusting, lack of haze and 
improved back side abrasion because of the affinity of 
the matte particle for gelatin due to the presence of 
polymeric latex on the surface. As previously indicated, the matte particles in 
accordance with this invention include a polymeric core 
material surrounded by a layer of colloidal polymeric 
latex particles reactive with or having an affinity for 
gelatin. Any suitable colloidal polymer latex particles
