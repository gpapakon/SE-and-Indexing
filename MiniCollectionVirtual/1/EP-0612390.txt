<ABSTRACT>
A sealing and joining arrangement (49) suitable for use in conjunction with a valve (28) used for delivering a blast of compressed air from a reservoir (20) to a blow-tube (34) of a dust-collector baghouse (39). The arrangement comprises (i) a socket-to-tube interconnection including one seal (48) to adapt the socket to the tube; and (ii) a second compliant seal (42) to adapt either the socket or tube (as required) to a clearance hole (44) of a bulkhead wall (36) of the baghouse. The socket-to-tube part of the arrangement may be applied to either outlet (preferably), inlet or both. The arrangement (49) may facilitate assembly of many valves in a baghouse typical within the dust collector field.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to valves, in particular the
connection ports of such valves. It more particularly
relates to the joining arrangements used to connect such
valves to compressed air supply and delivery points. It
includes associated resilient moulded sealing members and
means of adaptation of the valve ports to the inlet and
outlet ducts to which the valve is to be connected.A particular presently known application relates to right-angle
flow path diaphragm valves as used in the reverse flow
or reverse jet pulse dust collector valve art. U.S. patent
3,757,497 discloses a control valve for such a dust
collector apparatus. The apparatus includes a header,
connected to the inlet of a right-angle diaphragm valve.
The outlet of the valve is connected to a blowtube which
passes compressed air into a chamber containing the filter
bags. The blowtube is rigidly connected to the casing of
the chamber, and has an O-ring seal at its connection to the
valve outlet.Belgian patent 409,374 discloses a seal for use in a socket
and tube connection. The seal is resiliently deformable,
and is placed around an end of the tube, the tube and seal
then being pushed into the socket. The seal prevents
contact between the tube and the socket. Australian patent
8377/61 discloses a resilient seal for use with a rotating
shaft which passes substantially perpendicularly through a
clearance hole in a wall. The seal includes a skirt portion
adapted to deformably bear against the wall surrounding the
clearance hole, the skirt portion extending both radially
outwardly and axially away from one end of a shaft gripping
portion.In the reverse flow or reverse jet pulse dust collector
field, the invention relates to joining or connection 
arrangements applicable to interposing such valves as
require connecting one duct sourcing compressed air to a
second duct at right-angles to the first that requires the
compressed air to be delivered to it. The applicability of
the invention may extend to 180° flow path valves and piston
rather than diaphragm valves.The applicability of the invention by way of example to the
specialised dust collector art is illustrated in the
schematic accompanying illustrations Figure 10 and 11 and
described later in more detail with reference to those
Figures.In the dust collector field, prior art connection
arrangements have included tapered threaded connections at
the valve ports and, at greater expense, compression nut
Dresser-type fittings. Problems already experienced with
valves having threaded inlets include

<CLAIMS>
A compressed air pressure tight sealing and joining
arrangement in conjunction with a valve (28), the valve

having an inlet port and an outlet port with a socket, the inlet port
being connectable by an inlet pipe (24) to a rigid

header reservoir (20) containing compressed air and the
outlet port being connectable by way of the socket (46)

and tube connection to a compressed air delivery duct
(34), which duct passes substantially perpendicularly

through a wall (36) into an enclosed chamber (39), the
arrangement including first sealing means (48) adapted

to seal the said socket and tube connection,
characterised in that a second sealing means (42) is

provided, the second sealing means being adapted to
seal a clearance hole (44) in the wall (36), the second

sealing means comprising an annularly shaped pre-moulded
axial push-on resilient sealing member having a

skirt portion (62) adapted to deformably bear against
the wall surrounding said clearance hole, the skirt

portion extending both radially outwardly and axially
away from one end of a cylinder gripping portion (60),

which gripping portion is adapted to be axially
slidable over a pre-determined one of either said

socket (46) or duct (34), and in that the said skirt
portion (62) is tapered. 
A sealing and joining arrangement according to claim 1
characterised in that the said first sealing means (48)

has an elongate tubular first portion (70) adapted to
overlie and frictionally grip one end of the duct (34),

the first sealing means also having a rounded cross-section
nose portion (74) extending outwardly in both

the axial and radial directions such that the maximum
diameter of the nose portion is, in its unconstrained

condition, larger than the diameter of the bore of the
said socket, the nose portion being able to maintain a

seal during relative axial movement between said socket
and said duct.
A sealing and joining arrangement according to claim 1
or claim 2 characterised in that the socket is tapered.
A sealing and joining arrangement according to claim 3
characterised in that the first sealing means (48) is

tolerant of angular misalignment (X) between the socket
(46) and duct (34), and in that the angle of

misalignment may be about 3°.
A sealing and joining arrangement according to any of
the preceding claims characterised in that the

clearance hole (44) is of a pre-determined size to
provide clearance to either the duct (34) or socket

(46). 
A sealing and joining arrangement according to any of
the preceding claims characterised in that the socket

(46) is integral with the body of the valve (28).
A sealing and joining arrangement according to any of
claims 1-5 in which the valve (28) has a threaded

outlet port, characterised in that a socket-to-thread
adaptor (90) is provided, the adaptor having a socket

(46).
A sealing and joining arrangement according to any
preceding claim characterised in that the socket (46)

has a smoothly finished outer cylindrical surface
adapted to receive, by sliding thereon, the said second

sealing means (42), the said gripping portion (60)
being slidable over the outer surface of the socket to

provide an adjustable sealing position in conjunction
with the positioning of the socket relative to the

clearance hole (44).
A sealing and joining arrangement according to any
preceding claim characterised in that the valve is a

right-angle flow path diaphragm valve (28).
A sealing and joining arrangement according to any
preceding claim in which a first sealing means (48) is
