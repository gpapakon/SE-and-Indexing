<ABSTRACT>
A liquid fuel campstove is provided with a 
piezoelectric ignition system. The campstove includes a liquid 

fuel tank (17), a burner assembly (18) having a fuel inlet (80) and 
fuel outlet (76) 

orifices, a generator tube (52) which is connected to the fuel tank 
and extends adjacent the burner assembly, and a U-shaped venturi 

tube (78) which extends from the generator (52) to the fuel inlet (80) of the 
burner assembly. A pilot tube (101) is inserted into the venturi tube 

and extends to adjacent the fuel outlet orifices of the burner 

assembly. The electrode (96) of the piezoelectric ignition system (90) is 
positioned adjacent the end (103) of the pilot tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid fuel campstoves, and, 
more particularly, to liquid fuel campstoves with a 
piezoelectric electronic ignition system. Conventional liquid fuled stoves are match lit. This 
requires the customer to strike a match and hold it near the 
stove's main burner and then to properly set the stove fuel 
control valve for the ignition cycle. This is inconvenient, and 
the difficulty of getting everything done quickly and in the 
right order, particularly in wet and windy conditions, can 
result in an excessive amount of unvaporizad fuel collecting in 
the lower part of the stove's burner venturi area. The excess 
fuel condition is called flooding and results in a lazy 
yellow-colored flame which extends a few inches above the 
burner. This flame gradually subsides as the excess fuel is 
depleted and the generator gets hot. In a conventional liquid fueled stove such as the ones 
which Coleman has offered for many years, fuel is contained in a 
pressure vessel into which air is pumped under pressure. See, 
for example, U.S. Patent Re. 29,457. The vessel is equipped 
with a dip tube which extends to nearly the bottom of the tank. 
The dip tube is closed at the bottom with the exception of a 
small diameter orifice through which fuel is allowed to enter. 
The dip tube has an internal conduit which is open at the bottom 
and which communicates with the upper part of the pressure 
vessel above the maximum intended fuel level. The dip tube 
orifice can be partly blocked by insertion of a needle which is 
suitably connected to the fuel control system so as to cause it 
to partly block the orifice during the lighting cycle and to 
leave the orifice unblocked during the normal burn cycle. The 
upper end of the dip tube is connected through a valve system to 
a generator. The generator is a metal tube which passes above 
the burner of the stove into a venturi assembly which is 
connected to a burner. Fuel is discharged at high velocity from  
 
an orifice at the end of the generator into the venturi where 
air is aspirated and mixed and fed to the burner as a 
combustible mixture for burning. During the lighting cycle, 
unvaporized gasoline is discharged through the orifice and is 
not readily ignitable. To overcome this problem, the dip tube 
needle is used to partly block the fuel entry orifice. This 
creates a pressure imbalance within the dip tube which permits 
pressurized air to flow through the passageway inside of the dip 
tube from above the fuel. This pressurized air mixes with the
