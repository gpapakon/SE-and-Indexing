<ABSTRACT>
A molecular drag vacuum pump has a high vacuum (HV) area and a fore-vacuum (VV) area. In order to avoid, on the pumping surfaces, the formation of solid materials when such pumps are used for chemical processes, the HV area and the VV area have different working temperatures, so that the temperature of the HV area is lower than the temperature of the VV area.

Gas friction vacuum pump with a high vacuum (HV) region 
and a fore vacuum (FV) region and with a cooler (35,41), 

wherein cooling is initiated in the HV region, 
characterised in that its FV side is equipped with a 

heater (42,52) so, during operation of the pump, its HV 
region and its FV region have different operating 

temperatures, more specifically in such a way that the 
temperature of the HV region is lower than the 

temperature of the FV region. 
Vacuum pump according to claim 1 with a rotor operated at 
high speed, with a driving motor for the rotor and with a 

power supply comprising a transformer for the driving 
motor, characterised in that the transformer (52) forms 

the heater and is fastened on the vacuum pump in the 
region of the FV side. 
Vacuum pump according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the transformer (52) is annular in design and has an 

external diameter roughly corresponding to the external 
diameter of the pump housing. 
Vacuum pump according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the transformer (52) is detachably fastened on a 

base flange (3) of the pump. 
Vacuum pump according to one of claims 2, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the transformer (52) is arranged in 

a housing (55) made of material which is a good conductor 
of heat. 
Vacuum pump according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it is equipped with one or more 

heat conducting resistances (37,46) for thermally 
separating the HV side from the FV side.  

 
Vacuum pump according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it is equipped with an air cooler 

(35,36) or a fluid cooler (41) on its HV side 
Vacuum pump according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that a control system (43,44) is 

provided which controls the cooler (35,36,41) and/or the 
heater (42) as a function of signals delivered by one or 

more temperature sensors (44). 
Vacuum pump according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that it is designed as a turbomolecular 

pump with a housing (1) and a stator (4) having several 
spacer rings (10). 
Vacuum pump according to claim 9 and one of claims 6 to 
8, characterised in that the housing (1) and/or the 

stator (4) and/or the rotor (6) and/or the bush (24) of a 
bearing (14) are equipped with a heat-conducting 

resistance. 
Vacuum pump according to claim 9, characterised in that 
one of the spacer rings (10) of the stator (4) consists 

of or is coated with material which is a poor conductor 
of heat.
