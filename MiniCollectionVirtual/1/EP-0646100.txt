<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a product (1) so arranged as to reduce the occurrence of so-called lime precipitation in connection with the application of rendering, surface colour finish or a combined product thereof, containing a hydraulic binding agent, to a facade (2) or some other similar surface, and as to permit the appropriately slow binding of the substances present in the product (1) in order to permit its manageable application along the intended application surface. The following are included in same according to the invention: a rapid-binding binding agent in the form of aluminous cement, preferably Lafarge 
<

>
 SEC 71, at a level of 5-30 percent by weight and filler at a level of 60-95 percent by weight. The binding process of the product is slow, in spite of the normally rapid-binding characteristics of the binding agent. The absent or low lime-precipitation characteristic of the binding agent is also utilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rendering 
and/or colour finish product for use on a facade or similar 
surface and containing a hydraulic mineral binding agent. Surface finishing products of the aforementioned 
kind intended to be applied to facades or other similar 
surface-shaped substrates have in principle always involved 
the use of lime as a binding agent for the products in 
question. Cement, such as Portland cement, has also been 
used as a binding agent more recently. Pure air-hardening lime binds in such a way that 
it carbonizes through the effect of the air, and the 
binding process thus proceeds slowly, especially during 
cold and damp weather. Cement binds chemically with water, by a process 
known as hydration, and this results in a more reliable 
binding process with better adhesion and strength compared 
with lime. The problems which unfortunately arise as a 
result of using these mineral binding agents are well-known, 
however, namely the risk of lime precipitation when 
binding agents containing cement are used. Such white lime 
precipitates can noticeably discolour facades and other 
surfaces to which the product is applied, although this 
has nothing to do with the strength and the service life 
of the rendering and is entirely an aesthetic and 
particularly troublesome problem. Lime precipitates can 
occur, for example, if the facade, etc., in question is 
exposed to heavy rain after completion and will arise 
especially in cold and damp weather conditions during the 
autumn. The reason is that portlandite, which is readily 
soluble in water, is formed as the cement sets. In the 
presence of a high water content and/or rapid evaporation, 
this lime can be transported rapidly to the surface of the 
surface rendering and can be deposited on it through 
precipitation of the lime, resulting in troublesome white  
 
colouration of the surface of the rendering. The same 
problem also applies to colour finishes of the 
aforementioned kind. Due to the fact that rendering is now carried 
out mechanically for the most part, more water is used in 
the mixes in order to make them capable of spray 
application, when the problem referred to above becomes 
even more noticeable. Said previously disclosed binding agents are 
also sensitive to various forms of suction from the 
substrate and the method of applying the material. This can 
lead to the result not being satisfactory, and to the 
occurrence of troublesome patchiness and other colour 
irregularities. The advantages of using mineral
