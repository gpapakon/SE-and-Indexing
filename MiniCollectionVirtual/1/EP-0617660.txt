<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of adhesively
applied labels. In particular the invention relates to
biaxially oriented polymer film structures employed as
adhesively applied labels.Of recent years polymeric films have boon utilized
to take the place of paper for product labels and the
like. Synthetic film labels are stronger and in some
respects easier to handle in automatic machinery
employed for applying labels to products.A typical system employs a release layer which
carries a label removable therefrom. The label carried
by the release substrate has a pressure sensitive
adhesive on one side and product identifying indicia or
other information on the other. The release layer is
composed of a substrate which has a surface to which
the label adhesive will not aggressively adhere. The
release characteristics of the substrate and the
adhesive are such that when the substrate is bent
through a certain angle, the stiffness of the label
will cause it to separate from the release surface in
spite of the presence of the adhesive. This will
permit a container or product to be interfaced with the
adhesive layer so that the label will transfer from the
release surface to the product to be labeled. This
technique happens rapidly and sequentially in automated
mechanism. One shortcoming in general with the use of
polymeric films for label stock is that they cannot
esthetically compete with opaque gloss coated paper for
pressure sensitive or activatable adhesive-label face
stock applications. Therefore, it is an abject of the
present invention to present a synthetic film-adhesive
label face stock having high gloss and thus the ability
to esthetically compete with coated paper stock for
label purposes.U.S. 4,965,123 discloses an opaque film having a voided polypropylene
core with skin layers.U.S. 4,377,616 discloses an opaque film having a voided core an non-voided
skin layers. The opaque label stock of the present invention
includes the following multilayer structures:
(a) an oriented thermoplastic polymer matrix core
layer having a first surface and a second surface.
Within the matrix is located a strata of voids and
positioned at least substantially within a substantial
number of said voids is at least one spherical
void-initiating particle which is phase distinct and
incompatible with said matrix material. The void space
occupied by said particle being substantially less than
the volume of said void, with one generally
cross-sectional dimension of said particle at least
approximating a corresponding

An opaque, biaxially oriented, polymeric label
stock structure, comprising:


(a) a voided core layer comprising a matrix of
polypropylene in which are dispersed thermoplastic

polymeric void-initiating solid particles which
are phase distinct from the polypropylene,

skin layer adhering to the first surface of the

core layer this skin layer having a 45Â° gloss of 50 or greater;
(c) a thermoplastic polymer skin layer adhering
to the second surface of the core layer; and
(d) an adhesive on the second surface of the
thermoplastic polymer skin layer (c).
