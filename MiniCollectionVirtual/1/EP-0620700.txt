<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for radio-frequency operation of a low-pressure discharge lamp LL contains a voltage supply 10, a lamp generator 20, a switching transistor T2 and a control circuit 30 having a pulse-width regulator 32. For regulating the width of the switching-on pulses of the switching transistor T2, an instantaneous voltage provided by a current-limiting circuit 34 is compared with a reference voltage, the reference voltage being limited by a voltage limiting circuit 36 when overvoltages occur at the switching transistor T2. The control circuit 30 is supplied, before the discharge lamp LL is switched on, by a starting circuit 40 and, during operation of the discharge lamp LL, by a secondary inductance L10.
