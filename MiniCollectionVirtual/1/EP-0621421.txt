<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control apparatus 
for controlling a speed ratio in a belt-type continuously 
variable transmission. More particularly, it relates to a 
control apparatus for electrically controlling the speed 
ratio. Belt-type continuously variable transmissions are 
previously well-known and have been put to practical use. They 
comprise ,for example, drive and driven pulleys each having 
a variable pulley width and a metallic V-belt trained around 
the drive and driven pulleys. In the belt-type continuously variable transmission, 
the speed ratio (or gear ratio) is controlled by controlling 
the pulley widths of the drive and driven pulleys. 
The drive and driven pulleys respectively have drive and 
driven hydraulic cylinders for applying thrust forces, which 
are produced by a hydraulic pressure supplied to the cylinders, 
to the pulleys. The control of the thrust forces to 
the respective cylinders allows to vary the diameters of 
circles around which the V-belt is trained on the pulleys to  
 
control the speed ratio of the transmission. The control of 
the thrust forces also allows a tension control of the V-belt. 
One example of the speed ratio control apparatus for a 
belt-type continuously variable transmission is disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No.S61-206862. Such a belt-type continuously variable transmission 
as described above can be mounted on an automobile. In 
transmissions mounted in automobiles, the hydraulic pressure 
supplied to the hydraulic cylinder to produce the thrust 
force is often controlled electrically. The hydraulic pressure 
is regulated by solenoid valves or solenoid actuators 
which are operationally controlled based on electric signals 
corresponding to an engine throttle opening and an engine 
speed. One example of such a control apparatus is disclosed 
in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No.S63-215437. In a control apparatus in which the hydraulic 
pressure to produce the thrust force is electrically controlled, 
any electric trouble may deteriorate the controllability 
of speed ratio in the transmission. The control 
apparatus disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 
No.H4-243634 has means to enable a supplemental speed ratio 
control under an electric failure condition. The control 
apparatus has at least two parallel hydraulic control passages 
to supply a pulley width control pressure to the drive and 
driven cylinders. One of the control passages is is used under 
normal conditions and the other control
