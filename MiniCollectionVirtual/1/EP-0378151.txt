<ABSTRACT>
A stent (10) for reinforcing a vessel wall is constructed 
from a single elongated wire. The wire is first 

bent into a series of tight bends. The wire is then 
further bent into a sequence of loops (50) that are connected 

by half hitch junctions (56) and interconnections which are 
either aligned or spiral around a circumference of the 

stent. The completed stent forms a cylindrical form 
which can be expanded from an initial diameter to a 

larger implanted diameter by application of a radially 
outward force from a balloon catheter (12) or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an endoprosthesis 
device for implantation within a body vessel, typically 
a blood vessel. A type of endoprosthesis device, commonly referred 
to as a stent, is placed or implanted within a blood 
vessel for treating stenoses, strictures, or aneurysms 
in the blood vessel. These devices are implanted within 
the vascular system to reinforce collapsing, partially 
occluded, weakened, or abnormally dilated sections of 
the blood vessel. Stents also have been successfully 
implanted in the urinary tract or the bileducts to 
reinforce those body vessels. One common procedure for implanting the endopros­
thesis or stent is to first open the region of the 
vessel with a balloon catheter and then place the stent 
in a position that bridges the weakened portion of the 
vessel. Prior art patents refer to the construction and 
design of both the stent as well as the apparatus for 
positioning the stent within the vessel. One represen­
tative patent is U.S. Patent 4,140,126 to Chaudhury 
which issued February 20, 1979. This patent discloses a 
technique for positioning an elongated cyclindrical stent 
at a region of an aneurysm to avoid catastrophic failure 
of the blood vessel wall. The '126 patent discloses a 
cylinder that expands to its implanted configuration 
after insertion with the aid of a catheter. A second prior art patent to Dotter, U.S. 4,503,569 
which issued March 12, 1985 discloses a spring stent 
which expands to an implanted configuration with a 
change in temperature. The spring stent is implanted in  
 
a coiled orientation and heated to cause the spring to 
expand. U.S. Patent 4,733,665 to Palmaz which issued March 
29, 1988 discloses a number of stent configurations for 
implantation with the aid of a catheter. The catheter 
includes a mechanism for mounting and retaining the 
vascular prosthesis or stent, preferably on an in­
flatable portion of the catheter. The stent is 
implanted by positioning it within the blood vessel and 
monitoring its position on a viewing monitor. Once the 
stent is properly positioned, the catheter is expanded 
and the stent separated from the catheter body. The 
catheter can then be withdrawn from the subject, leaving 
the stent in place within the blood vessel. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 240,000 entitled 
"Radially Expandable Endoprosthesis and the Like" 
discloses a generally cylindrical stent formed from a 
wire that is bent into a series of tight bends and then 
spirally wound about a cylindrical mandrel to form the

1. A stent for reinforcing a vessel within a 
subject comprising a cylindrical support dimensioned to 

fit within an interior of said vessel constructed from 
an elongated wire bent to define a series of relatively 

tightly spaced convolutions or bends, said wire also 
bent in the form of a plurality of loops spaced along an 

axial dimension of the stent and connected by a series 
of half hitch junctions where each of the plurality of 

loops includes a number of said regularly spaced 
convolutions around its circumference, said stent being 

radially expandable from a first outer diameter which 
fits within said vessel to a second increased diameter 

which contacts an inner wall surface of said vessel to 
reinforce said inner wall. 
2. The stent of claim 1 wherein the wire is 
tantalum. 
3. The stent of claim 1 wherein an inner diameter 
of the stent is dimensioned to frictionally engage a 

non-inflated balloon catheter and be carried by the non-­
inflated balloon catheter into a blood vessel. 
4. The stent of claim 1 wherein the plurality of 
loops are regularly spaced along the length of the stent 

and are interconnected by lengths of convoluted wire 
that are aligned along the length of the stent to form a 

relatively straight backbone to said stent. 
5. The stent of claim 4 wherein gaps are left 
along the length of the stent to accommodate branches in 

the vessel so that the stent does not block off fluid 
flow through the branch. 
6. The stent of claim 1 wherein the plurality of 
loops are regularly spaced along the length of the stent 

and are interconnected by lengths of convoluted wire 
that are offset around the diameter of the stent to 

define a backbone having a relatively wide pitch that 
spirals about the stent. 
7. A method of fabricating a generally cylindri­
cal stent for insertion into a body vessel comprising 

the steps of: 

a) bending an elongated wire in a series of 
relatively tight convolutions or bends; 
b) providing a cylindrical mandrel of a 
dimension smaller than an inner diameter of the vessel 

into which the stent is to be inserted; 
c) wrapping the elongated wire around the 
mandrel to form a series of loop segments and intercon­

necting said loop segments by half hitch junctions and 
wire portions that connect successive loop segments 

along an axial dimension of the cylindrical mandrel; and 
d) removing the elongated wire from the 
mandrel to define a throughpassage for fluid passage 

through the stent in a region occupied by the cylindri­
cal mandrel. 
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the series of 
loops are connected by a sequence of wire portions that 

are radially spaced around the circumference of the 
stent. 
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the series of 
loops are connected by a sequence of wire portions that 

align along the length of the stent to form a relatively 
straight backbone to the stent. 
10. The method of claim 7 wherein subsequent to 
the removal of the stent from the mandrel one or more 

loops are removed from the stent to accommodate 
branching vessels and allow unimpeded fluid flow to said 

branching vessels after the stent is positioned within 
the vessel.
