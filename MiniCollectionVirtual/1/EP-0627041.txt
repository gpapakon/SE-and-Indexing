<ABSTRACT>
A rotary positive displacement machine for operation both as a compressor and an expander comprises a casing (6) housing intermeshing male and female rotors (2, 3), the casing (6) including a fluid inlet and a fluid discharge for fluid to be compressed or expanded, and drive means (9, 10) enabling driving of the rotors (2, 3) separately from each other so that the machine can operate as a dry machine. The rotors (2, 3) intermesh via lobes (4, 5) whose profiles are produced by a co-generation process, the male lobe (4) having a symmetric transverse profile of varying curvature while the opposite flanks (5L, 5T) of the female lobe (5) are generally concave but with a substantially straight portion at the tip arranged such that each female lobe (5) diverges at the tip. The machine enables leakage blow holes to be reduced both for the compressing and expansion modes of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary positive
displacement machines of the screw or helical rotors
type, normally used as fluid compressors such as air
compressors and to the rotors for use in such machines.
The invention relates to the dry type screw compressor
where no lubricating oil passes through the working zones
of the machine and the rotors are timed by the use of
timing gears positioned outside the working chambers of
the rotors which allow the rotors to rotate without
coming into contact with each other. This contrasts
with wet type screw compressors where one of the rotors
(usually the male rotor) engages and drives the other
rotor and to facilitate this driving operation
lubricating oil in this case is passed through the rotors
of the machine - such a wet type screw compressor is
described in U.S. Patent 4 673 344. The rotor profile of
such a machine must therefore provide suitable driving
surfaces.The aforementioned dry type rotary machine includes
a housing having at least one pair of intersecting bores
therein. Inlet and outlet ports are provided at opposite
ends of the casing bores. A rotor is mounted for
rotation within each of the bores.One of these rotors is of the male type which
includes one or more helical lobes and intervening
grooves which lie substantially outside the pitch circle
thereof with the flanks of the lobes having a generally
convex profile.The other rotor is of the female type and formed so
that it includes one or more helical lobes and
intervening grooves which lie substantially inside the
pitch circle thereof with the flanks of the grooves
having a generally concave profile.The lobes on the male rotor cooperate with the
grooves on the female rotor and the walls of the casing 
to define chambers for the fluid. These chambers may be
considered to be chevron shaped.Fluid enters the casing bores through the inlet port
filling the cavities which are generated as the rotors
come out of mesh on the low pressure side of the rotors.
Fluid normally continues to fill the generated chambers
until the chambers reach maximum volume. The filling
chamber is then cut off from communication with the inlet
port and the gas is compressed within the chamber. The
chamber boundaries consist of the leading and trailing
flanks of the male and female lobes and the bores in
which the rotors rotate.In a dry type screw compressor the rotors must not
be allowed to touch each other and therefore mesh
together with a small clearance between the meshing
flanks of the rotors and between the rotor tips

<CLAIMS>
A rotary positive displacement machine comprising
a pair of rotors (2,3) provided with intermeshing screw or

helical lobes (4,5) housed in casing means (6); and drive
means (8,9,10) for separate driving of the rotors (2,3)

wherein a first of the rotors, the male rotor (2), has a lobe
(4) of symmetric transverse profile, with varying centres of

curvature; and the profiles of the rotors (2,3) are produced
by a co-generation process, a root portion (RS) of the female

rotor (3) between lobes being generated by the tip of the male
rotor lo
be (4) and the trailing and leading surfaces of each
female lobe (5) having a first portion (SV) up to a transition

point (V) of concave form, characterised in that a final
portion (VW) to the female lobe tip is of

straight form, the final portions (VW) of the trailing and
leading surfaces of each female lobe (5) diverging from each

other in the radially outward direction.
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that a peripheral land (12) on the lobes (5) of the female

rotor (3) is of relatively wide form providing a long leak
path between the peripheral lands (12) and the casing means

(6).
A machine as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the basic rotor profile is a combination of point and

line generated and is symmetric in nature.
A machine as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3
characterised in that said first portion (SV) of the female

lobe flanks (5L, 5T) is generated by a tip corner (N) of the
male lobe (4), while the flanks (4L,4T) of the male lobe (4)

have a first portion (NP) from the male tip generated by said
transition point (V), of the female lobe, a second portion

(PQ) generated by the straight line (VW) of the female lobe,
and a final portion (QT) generated by the corner point (W) of

the female lobe tip.
