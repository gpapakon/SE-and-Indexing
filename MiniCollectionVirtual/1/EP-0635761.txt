<ABSTRACT>
Simulated photographic prints are created using xerographic imaging. A 
transparent substrate (25) having a xerographically formed mirror image fused thereto is 

bonded to a plastic substrate (116) through the use of heat and pressure. The transparent 
substrate (25) and the plastic substrate (116) form the finished print.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for producing continuous
tone images with near photographic print qualities using xerography.In the practice of conventional xerography, it is the general procedure to form
electrostatic latent images on a xerographic surface by first uniformly charging a charge
retentive surface such as a photoreceptor. The charged area is selectively dissipated in
accordance with a pattern of activating radiation corresponding to original images. The
selective dissipation of the charge leaves a latent charge pattern on the imaging surface
corresponding to the areas not exposed by radiation.This charge pattern is made visible by developing it with toner by passing the
photoreceptor past one or more developer housings. In monochromatic imaging, the toner
generally comprises black thermoplastic powder particles which adhere to the charge pattern
by electrostatic attraction. The developed image is then fixed to the imaging surface or is
transferred to a receiving substrate such as plain paper to which it is fixed by suitable fusing
techniques.Recently, there has been a great deal of effort directed to the development of color
copiers/printers which utilize the xerographic process. Such efforts have resulted in the recent
introduction of the Xerox™ 5775™ copier/printer and the Fuji Xerox A-Color 635 machine.The quality of color xerographic images on paper has approached the quality of color
photographic prints. However, color xerographic prints fall short because they do not have the
uniform gloss, dynamic range or brilliance typical of photographic prints. Nor do xerographic
prints have the feel of photographic prints because the paper usually used is too lightweight
and too limp.Typically the surface of color toner images is irregular, therefore, rather rough or
lumpy. The behavior of incident white light vis-a-vis such color images is believed to be as
follows:Some of the white light incident on the substrate carrying the color toner images
specularly reflects off the substrate.Some of the light goes down into the paper, scatters around and comes back out in
various directions, some through the toner and some not.Because the toner surface is rough or irregular some of the light incident thereon is
reflected off the toner in various directions.Some of the light incident on the irregular toner surfaces passes through the toner
into the paper and comes back out in various directions.White light becomes colored due to selective absorption as it passes through toner. The light

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a simulated photographic print, said method including:

contacting a wrong reading toner image (67) formed xerographically on one side of a
transparent substrate (25) with a light color backing member (116);
contacting said backing member (116) with an abhesive member (120);
contacting a non-image side of said transparent substrate with a flat rigid surface (100);
simultaneously applying heat and pressure at predetermined values to said substrate,
backing member and abhesive member (120) whereby said substrate (25) and said backing member (116) adhere to

each other to form said simulated photographic print;
separating said abhesive member (120) from said backing member (116); and
separating said simulated photographic print from said flat rigid surface (100).
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said step of simultaneously applying heat
and pressure comprises positioning said substrate (25), backing member (116), abhesive member

(120) and flat rigid surface between a pair of platens (92, 94) at least one of which is provided with a
source of heat energy capable of elevating the temperature of said substrate (25) and said backing

member (116).
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein said step of simultaneously applying heat
and pressure is effected by applying a force to one of said platens (92) in order to urge it in the

direction of the other of said platens (94).
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said backing member
(116) has a coating of adhesive material (118) on the side thereof which contacts the toner image

(67).
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said backing member
(116) is translucent.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said abhesive member
(120) comprises a polyester film having a silicone rubber coating on at least one side thereof.
A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein said abhesive member (120) comprises a
polyester film having a silicone rubber coating on each side thereof. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the thicknesses of said
simulated photographic print is approximately equal to 0.0229cm (0.009 inch).
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein said flat rigid surface
comprises tempered glass (100).
