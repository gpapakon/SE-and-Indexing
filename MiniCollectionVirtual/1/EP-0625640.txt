<ABSTRACT>
A scroll type compressor in which the discharge 
chamber is divided into two chambers by a dividing wall 

(283,293,303) which surrounds a bore (274) communicating 
the discharge chamber with a fluid pocket near the centre 

of the scroll members (27,28). The wall (283,293,303) has 
an opening (283a,293a,303a,303b) which faces a thermally 

sensitive area (123) in the wall of the compressor housing 
(10). A thermal sensor (60) is positioned behind the 

thermally sensitive area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid displacement apparatus, 
and more particularly, to an improvement in a thermal protected 
device in a fluid displacement apparatus. A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus is well known in 
the prior art. For example, U.S.Pat.No.4,411,604 issued to 
Terauchi discloses a basic construction of a scroll type fluid 
displacement apparatus. Generally, in the conventional refrigerant compressor, when 
the temperature of an compression refrigerant gas excessively 
rises, the compressor failure to normally operates per se since 
each parts of the compressor become to take a thermal expansion 
and increase a friction each other. Particularly, it is a problem 
in durability of the compressor that the temperature of a 
compression refrigerant gas at the center of a scroll excessively 
rises. The one contempt solution to the above problem is the use 
of a protected device which intermits the operation of the compression 
through the electromagnetic clutch by means of perceiving 
a temperature of the refrigerant gas when the compression gas 
rise to a predetermined temperature. Referring to Figure 1 and 2, a scroll type fluid displacement 
apparatus in accordance with the prior art is shown in the 
form of scroll type refrigerant compressor unit 1. Compressor  
 
unit 1 includes housing 10 having front end plate 11 mounted on 
cup-shaped casing 12. Opening 111 is formed in the center of 
front end plate 11 for penetration or passage of drive shaft 13. 
Annular projection 112 is formed in a rear end surface of front 
end plate 11. Annular projection 112 faces cup-shaped casing 12 
and is concentric with opening 111. An outer peripheral surface 
of annular projection 112 extends into an inner wall of the 
opening of cup-shaped casing 12 so that the opening of cup-shaped 
casing 12 is covered by front end plate 11. O-ring 14 is placed 
between the outer peripheral surface of annular projection 112 
and the inner wall of the opening of cup-shaped casing 12 to seal 
the mating surfaces of front end plate 11 and cup-shaped casing 
12. Annular sleeve 15 projects from the front end surface of 
front end plate 11 to surround drive shaft 13 and defines a shaft 
seal cavity, and is formed separately from front end plate 11. 
Therefore, sleeve 15 is fixed to the front end surface of front 
end plate 11 and sleeve 15. Alternatively, sleeve 15 may be 
formed integral with end plate 11. Drive shaft 13 is rotatably supported by sleeve 15 through 
bearing 18 located within the front end of sleeve
