<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a safety circuit for overload protection of electric motors, especially for driving adjustable seats. The object of the invention is to specify a simple circuit which ensures that the motor starts without any time delay after removal of the obstruction which caused the motor to be overloaded. The object is in principle achieved in that the motor is switched on only in a pulsed manner during the overload, while the pulsed switching-on of the motor is cancelled when the overload is not present. The pulsed switching by means of a reed switch which is connected as a make contact results in an interruptor switch, which is inserted into the motor circuit, opening as soon as an overload current occurs.

Safety switching system providing overload
protection for electric motors (15), and particularly

for the drive used in adjustable seats in vehicles,
whereby the motor current runs via a winding (16) of a

first relay (16, 17, 22) and the break contact (14) of
a second relay (20), and distinguished by the fact

that the first circuit runs through the operating
contact(22) of the first relay (16, 17, 22) and a

first winding (18) of the second relay (20), and the
second circuit runs through a second winding (19) of

the second relay (20), and that a current flowing
through the first circuit (2, 22, 18) effectively

opens the break contact (14), and a current flowing
through the second circuit (5, 6, 19) effectively

closes the break contact (14).
Safety switching system as per claim 1,
distinguished by the fact that when the voltages at

the first and second winding (18 and 19) are
approximately equal, the currents flowing through the

two winding open or keep open the contact (14).
Safety switching system as per claim 2,
distinguished by the fact that, as a result of the

first circuit (5, 22, 18) being interrupted by the
operating contact (22), the current flowing just

through the second circuit either closes or keeps
closed the break contact (14).
Safety switching system as per one of the previous
claims, distinguished by the fact that the two

windings (18, 19) of the second relay (20) are
counter-wound to each other and that the inductivity

of the first winding is sufficiently larger than that
of the second winding.
Safety switching system as per one of the previous
claims, distinguished by the fact that the first relay

(16, 17, 22) is set up as a reed relay, in which the
winding (16) of a reed spool and the operating contact

(22) constitutes a reed contact.
Safety switching system as per one of the previous
claims, distinguished by the fact that, in order to

reverse the direction of the motor (15), the motor
circuit can be connected to a voltage source (1) via a

current reverse switch (7). 
Safety switching system as per claim 6,
distinguished by the fact that the current reverse

switch (7) has a neutral position for halting the
motor (15).
Safety switching system as per claim 6 or 7,
distinguished by the fact that one pole (2) of the

voltage source (1) is connected into the second
circuit (19) via another contact (6, 12, 13) of the

current reverse switch.
Safety switching system as per one of the previous
claims, distinguished by the fact that the first

winding (18) is wired in parallel to a condenser (25),
preferably an electrolytic condenser.
