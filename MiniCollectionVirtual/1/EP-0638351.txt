<ABSTRACT>
The exhaust gas is brought into contact with a hydrophobic, dealuminated, sulphur-impregnated, granular zeolite of type X or Y at temperatures in the range from 20 to 120 DEG C. In the crystal lattice, the zeolite has an atomic ratio of silicon:aluminium of 20:1 to 300:1. The sulphur content of the granular zeolite can be in the range from 1 to 20% by weight.

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing mercury from an exhaust gas 
containing water vapour and SO
2
, wherein the exhaust gas 
is brought into contact at temperatures in the range of 

20 to 120Â°C with a granular zeolite of type X or Y 
impregnated with sulphur or a sulphur compound, the 

mercury is bound to the zeolite support in the form of 
HgS, and a hydrophobic, de-aluminised zeolite is used 

which has an atomic ratio of silicon to aluminium of 
20 : 1 to 300 : 1 in the crystal lattice. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the type X or type Y zeolite has an atomic ratio 

of Si : Al of more than 50 in the crystal lattice. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the zeolite is impregnated with elemental 

sulphur. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the sulphur content of the 

granular zeolite is 1 to 20% by weight. 
A method according to Claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterised in that an exha
ust gas 
which has an Hg content of 0.01 to 10 mg per Nm
3
, 
calculated in the dry state, is brought into contact 

with the granular zeolite. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that an exhaust gas having a relative 

moisture content of 5 to 90% and an SO
2
 content of 1 to 
500 mg/Nm
3
, calculated in the dry state, is brought into 
contact with the granular zeolite.  

 
A method according to Claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterised in that the exhaust gas 

comes from the heat treatment of waste or other 
substances. 
A method according to Claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterised in that the granular 

zeolite is used in a mixture with granular activated 
carbon in a weight ratio of 1 : 1 to 10 : 1.
