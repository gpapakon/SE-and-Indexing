<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automotive
lubricants such as engine oils, gear oils and automatic
transmission fluids.Traditionally automotive lubricants have been based
on conventional mineral oils. Whilst these have proved
adequate in the past, mineral oil basestocks cannot always
meet the increasing demands for superior lubricant
properties, especially operational lifetime. These
improved properties can be obtained to some extent by the
use of additives, but research has also been conducted
into modifying or changing the basestocks. In recent
years lubricant manufacturers have produced automotive
lubricants based on synthetic basestocks, for example
polyalphaolefins and esters. Whilst these provide
improved performance, they have the disadvantage that they
are expensive.There is therefore a need for an automotive lubricant
with an alternative, less expensive basestock which
provides improved properties.UK Patent 737,392 discloses a lubricating oil
containing an organo-tin compound as antioxidant. The
basestock may be derived from petroleum distillates and
residuals refined by conventional means, hydrogenated
mineral oils, white mineral oils, or polyether and
polyester lubricants used alone or blended with mineral
oil lubricants. The lubricant may be applied as a crank
case oil, heating oil, hydraulic fluid, cutting oil,
turbine oil or transformer oil. US Patent 3,853,773 discloses an anti-gum and solvating lubricant for use
with precision mechanical devices. It is based on a combination of a type-A
transmission fluid (as defined in the patent) with a highly refined white oil.US Patent 4,652,385 discloses a lubricant containing a combination of a tri-substituted
phosphite and sterically hindered phenolic stabilisers as antioxidant. The
basestock is a hydrotreated oil, polyalphaolefin oil or paraffinic white oil, or mixtures
thereof. The lubricant is used in high temperature applications, for example as a
compressor oil, heat transfer oil, hydraulic fluid or steam turbine oil.US Patent 2,892,784 discloses a lubricant with improved antioxidation
performance. The lubricant comprises a base oil, which may be any oil of lubricating
viscosity, and an additive comprising a combination of an aromatic amine oxidation
inhibitor together with a copolymer of a higher alkyl ester of an α,β-olefinically
unsaturated C3-C8 carboxylic acid and an amino lower alkyl ester of such an acid.European Patent Publication 281992A discloses a lubricant with improved
stability against NOx degradation. The lubricant comprises a

<CLAIMS>
An automotive lubricant selected from at least one of engine oil, gear
oil and automatic transmission oil comprising:


(a) a basestock of which at least 30 wt.% is a white oil having a
naphthenic content of at least 25 wt.%; and
(b) one or more additives, at least one additive being an
antioxidant other than a tin-containing antioxidant.
An automotive lubricant according to claim 1 wherein the viscosity at
100°C is in the range of from 4 to 50 mm
2
/s and the viscosity index is in the range of
from 80 to 200.
An automotive lubricant according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
basestock is substantially 100% white oil.
An automotive lubricant according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
basestock is a blend of white oil and one or more of mineral oil, synthetic oil and

hydrocracked-type basestock.
An automotive lubricant according to claim 4 wherein the synthetic oil
is a polyalphaolefin.
An automotive lubricant according to any preceding claim wherein the
white oil has a naphthenic content (ASTM D-2140) of from 30 to 50 wt.%.

naphthenic content of at least 25 wt.%; and
(b) one or more additives, at least one additive being an
antioxidant other than a tin-containing antioxidant.
Use as an automotive automatic transmission fluid of a composition
comprising:


(a) a basestock comprising at least 30 wt.% white oil having a
naphthenic content of at least 25 wt.%; and
(b) one or more additives, at least one additive being an
antioxidant other than a tin-containing antioxidant.
Use as an automotive engine oil of a composition comprising:

(a) a basestock comprising at least 30 wt.% white oil having a
naphthenic content of at least 25 wt.%; and
(b) one or more additives, at least one additive being an
antioxidant other than a tin-containing antioxidant.
A method of operating automotive equipment comprising one or more
of an internal combustion engine, a gearbox or an automatic transmission, the method

comprising lubricating the equipment with an automotive lubricant, characterised in
that the automotive lubricant is in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 7.
