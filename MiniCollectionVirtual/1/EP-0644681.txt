Microelectronic data and/or function carriers for contact-free data and
energy transmission, comprising at least two spatially separated receiving

elements (KS_L, KS_R) for alternating fields, at least one electronic unit
(E1, E2, E3) for processing the alternating field components at the receiving

elements (KS_L, KS_R) as signals (DKS_L, DKS_R) in such a way that a
phase shift between the alternating field components at the receiving

elements (KS_L, KS_R) is unambiguously imaged in a phase shift between
the signals (DKS_L, DKS_R), 
characterized in that

when a preset value of the phase shift occurs between said signals (DKS_L,
DKS_R), a first output signal level (PHS) is generated and, when the phase

shift deviates from the preset value, a second output signal level (PHS'),
which differs from the first output signal level (PHS), is generated, whereby

at least one additional electronic circuit is activated when one of the two
signal levels (PHS, PHS') occurs and is deactivated when the other signal

level (PHS, PHS') occurs.
A device for contact-free data and energy transmission, comprising a
terminal that has at least two alternating field sources for generating and

emitting alternating fields,

a data and/or function carrier according to Claim 1, whereby the receiving
elements (KS_L, KS_R) of the data and/or function carrier are suitable for

receiving the alternating fields emitted by the terminal.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the alternating fields emanating from the alternating field sources of the
terminal are provided at various locations of the data and/or function carrier

which have phases that differ from each other, and these different
alternating fields are superimposed in the surrounding space, as a result of 

which they cause different resulting phase gradients in a location-dependent
manner, so that consequently, the output level (PHS) results from all of the

alternating fields.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

between the alternating field sources of the terminal, such phase differences
are selected that the phase gradient available at the location of the data

and/or function carrier allows the determination of the most unambiguous,
geometric location possible with respect to the spatial positions of the

alternating field sources of the terminal.
The device according to one of the preceding Claims 2 through 4,

characterized in that

a remaining ambiguity of the signaled geometric location is reduced 
in that

at least one more - different - geometric location is signaled that intersects
with the first signaled geometric location and thus becomes a new geometric

location having a smaller extension.
The device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that

the newly added geometric location is ascertained by differing modulation of
the phase of the alternating field sources of the terminal.
The device according to one of the preceding Claims 2 through 6,

characterized in that
 another geometric location in the data and/or function

carrier is added through the evaluation of intensity differences of the
distinguishable alternating field components that are obtained through

differing modulation of the alternating field sources of the terminal. 
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the system state to be changed is the access authorization of the source
tupel, especially sensitive data or operations within the data and/or function

carrier.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the limit value during operation can be adjusted by intervention with
stronger access rights in any desired direction, for which purpose the data

and/or function carrier has a switch that uses a switch actuation to activate
or deactivate the remote transmission of the data and/or function carrier.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
,

in the case of a data and/or function carrier that is fundamentally set up for
remote operation, the momentary effectiveness of the remote operation is

decided by a comparison of the signal PHS with the limit value and a
comparator serves for this purpose which switches the effectiveness of the

remote operation in the desired manner.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the limit value during operation can be adjusted by intervention with
weaker access rights only in such a direction that the access to certain,

sensitive data and/or operations requires stronger access rights in the
sequence, for which purpose the data and/or function carrier has a switch

that can only be bridged by the signal PHS when the data and/or function
carrier is within the range of the terminal.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the direction of action of the criterion (PHS) has such a mathematical sign
that a greater geometric distance of the data and/or function carrier from the 

focal point of the source tupel of the alternating field sources of the terminal
brings about a weakening of the access rights.
The device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the limit value is permanently set at such a quantity that, outside of the
acquisition range of the terminal, no proximity operation is possible.
The device according to one of Claims 9 or 11, 
characterized in that

the manually operable switch on the data and/or function carrier is
combined with the signal PHS for activating or deactivating function

elements in order to create new functional situations.
The data and/or function carrier according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the first output signal level (PHS) is generated in an electronic unit
(E1) and the second output signal level (PHS') is generated in another

electronic unit (E2) for which optionally an embodiment with an integrated
signal processor is selected.
