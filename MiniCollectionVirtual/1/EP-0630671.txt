<ABSTRACT>
A sewage treatment system is provided, for cleaning a sewage 
by filtering solid components in the swage through floating 

filter medium, wherein the filtration performance can be 
improved and the filtration cleaning can be performed 

efficiently. The sewage (18) is flowed into the treatment tank 
(12) in upward-flow, and filtered through the floating filter 

media layer (22) made of the meshy cylindrical floating filter 
medium (20) which have smaller specific gravity than the sewage 

(18). To wash floating filter medium (20), the air is jetted 
from the air jetting pipe (54) and the revolution flow is 

generated to scale solid components adhering to filter medium, 
and then the sewage (18), which has washed the floating filter 

medium (20), are discharged to the outside of the tank (12) 
while the air is jetted from the air jetting pipe (56) for full 

jetting to jet the floating filter media layer (22) in whole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sewage treatment system intended for filtering solid
components in sewage and cleansing the sewage.A solid-liquid separator disclosed in EP-A-0 423 403 comprises a buoyant filter medium
in a sewage tank. The filter medium filters solid components from the waste water
contained in the tank. An air introducing pipe for introducing air in a sedimentation zone
below the filter medium is provided in the bottom area of the tank. A drain pipe for
draining liquid is provided below the air introducing pipe. For washing the filter medium,
air is introduced in the tank via the air introducing pipe. The introduced air causes a
circular flow of the filter medium layer so that the solid components are washed from the
filter medium. In order to avoid that the solid components re-adhere to the filter medium,
the mixed water has to be drained by a considerable high velocity.WO-A-9118658 discloses a filtration apparatus comprising a column having a lower liquid
inlet, an upper liquid outlet and a bed of buoyant particles in the liquid therebetween.
Biomass is collected on the buoyant particles. Air providing means are located in the
bottom area of the column. The liquid can be circulated by means of the air providing
means which causes the particles to circulate so that the biomass is removed from the
particles by attrition.In a special embodiment of WO-A-9118658, a filtration apparatus comprises two
compartments, each having air diffusers for producing a circular flow in the respective
compartment. Each compartment is provided with a separate floating filter media layer.
For minimising the effect of the lower air diffusers to the upper compartment, a cowl
between the compartments collects air and backwash water from the lower compartment. Generally, a conventional sewage treatment process,
which cleanses the sewage and releases the proceeds into public
waters such as river and lake, consists of two parts; The first
process of natural sedimentation of solid components in the
sewage in the primary sedimentation tank, and the second
process of biological treatment by microbes in the activated
sludge treatment system. The activated sludge in the sewage
which have been treated biologically is sediment in the final
sedimentation tank, and the supernatant liquid of the sewage is
released and a part of the activated sludge is taken out as
surplus sludge, and then the remaining part of the activated
sludge is sent to the activated sludge treatment system. After
the sewage has been treated to conform to

A sewage treatment system (10) intended for filtering solid components in
sewage (18) and cleansing the sewage, the sewage treatment system

comprising:

a single floating filter media layer (22) which is provided in a treatment tank (12)
for filtering the solid components in the sewage (18) which is upwardly flowed in

the treatment tank (12), the layer (22) being formed by numerous floating
filter medium particles which have a smaller specific gravity than the sewage (18);
