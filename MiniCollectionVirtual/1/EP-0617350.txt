<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods and a device for the remote control of heating and air-conditioning installations as well as for self-diagnosis with remote transmission of operating information to external devices. The remote control is preferably carried out via the telephone network, the command information being carried out after establishing a connection between a telephone (2) and a communications device (1) connected to the heating or air-conditioning installation by means of pressing a key combination according to the DTMF code, which is decoded and converted by the communications device (1). In the case of self-diagnosis, the communications device (1) interrogates operating data from the control device of the heating or air-conditioning installation and communicates them automatically to receiving devices, such as fax (4), regional radio-paging system (5) or a terminal (6).
