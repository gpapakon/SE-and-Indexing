<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for producing electrochemical sensors made of metal. A contact element made of a metal having a higher melting point than the metal of which the sensor is made is connected to the material of which the sensor is made. A pipe is made of the same metal than the contact element, the pipe is secured in a predetermined, preferably vertical, position. The pipe (1) is filled with a powder produced from the same metal of which the electrode is made and the whole structure is heated up above the melting point of the metal of which the electrode is made in a closed oven in a vacuum or in a protective gas atmosphere. The powdered electrode material melts and the molten powder is cooled down until it solidifies in a vacuum or in the protective gas atmosphere. Alternatively, both ends of the pipe may be closed before heating. Also disclosed is an electrochemical sensor produced according to this process having a sensor surface made of particularly pure magnesium, rare earth metal, gold, platinum or aluminium or of an alloy of such metals, as well as a contact element metallically connected thereto. The electrode material is arranged inside a pipe made of a metal having a higher melting point than the electrode material.

A method for producing electrochemical sensors made of 
metal, wherein a contact element is bonded to the metal 

constituting the sensor material, the contact element being 
made of a different metal the melting point of which is above 

that of the sensor metal, characterised in that a tube (1) is 
formed from the metal constituting the contact element, that 

powder manufactured from the metal forming the electrode is 
filled into the interior of the tube (1), that in this position 

within a space excluding corrosion the powder is heated to a 
temperature above the melting point of the metal forming the 

electrode, and subsequently cooled down until the molten powder 
solidifies. 
The method of claim 1, characterised in that magnesium, 
a rare-earth element, gold, platinum, or aluminium of 

particularly high purity, or alloys of these metals are used as 
the electrode metal. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
two ends of the tube (1) are closed prior to the heating 

process. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
tube (1) is mounted in a predetermined, preferably vertical 

position, that in this position the interior of the tube (1) is 
filled with the powder manufactured from the metal forming the 

electrode, that the heating process is performed in a closed 
furnace in vacuo or in a protective atmosphere, this 

environment being maintained at least until the molten powder 
solidifies. 
The method of claim 4, characterised in that the tubes 
(1) are arranged in bores (3) of a positioning tool (2) 

provided with a multiplicity of vertical positioning bores (3), 
wherein the upper end of each tube (1) is placed below the 

upper plane of the positioning tool (2), and the powder is 
apportioned and the heating process carried out while the tubes 

(1) are held in the positioning tool (2). 
The method of any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the method sets out from a tube (1) the length of which 

is a multiple of the required electrode length, and this tube  
 

(1) is divided according to the desired electrode length after 
the cooling process. 
An electrochemical sensor comprising a sensor surface 
consisting of magnesium, a rare-earth element, gold, platinum, 

or aluminium of particularly high purity, or an alloy of these 
metals, and a contact element bonded to said sensor surface 

through a metallic connection, characterised in that the 
electrode material is disposed inside a tube (1) consisting of 

a metal the melting point of which is above that of the 
electrode material. 
The electrochemical sensor of claim 7, characterised in 
that the contact element is bonded to the wall of the tube (1).
