<ABSTRACT>
Device for continuously measuring the concentration of suspended matter or the turbidity of a centrifugate produced by a centrifuge or a dehydration machine, characterised in that it comprises:   - a deaeration enclosure (20) of cylindroconical shape, to the upper part of which a sample of the centrifugate withdrawn by continuous pumping is brought tangentially, the upward speed of the gas bubbles separated from the centrifugate in the said enclosure must be at least twice as large as the speed of the liquid let into the enclosure and the deaerated liquid, being identical in composition to the withdrawn sample, leading to no solids/liquid separation induced by buoyancy, and - a concentration sensor (16), receiving the deaerated centrifugate from the lower conical part (22) of the said deaeration enclosure.

Process for the continuous measurement of the concentration of suspended
materials or the turbidity of a centrifugate coming from a centrifuge

or a dehydration machine, according to which a sample of the centrifugate
removed by continuous pumping is supplied to a deaeration enclosure, characterized

in that said centrifugate sample is supplied tangentially into
the upper part of said enclosure (20), the rising speed of gas bubbles

separated from the centrifugate in said enclosure is at least twice higher
than the speed of the liquid admitted into the enclosure and the measurement

of the concentration takes place on a completely deaerated centrifugate,
whose composition is identical to that of the sample removed.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the passage speed
of the centrifugate sample in the deaeration enclosure (20) is approximately

0.1 to 0.5 cm/sec.
Process according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in that
the rising speed of the gas bubble separated from the centrifugate in the

deaeration enclosure (20) is approximately 0.6 to 5 cm/sec.
Device for performing the process according to any one of the claims
1 to 3, characterized in that it has a cylindroconical deaeration enclosure

(20), into the upper part of which is delivered the centrifugate sample,
the conical lower area (22) of said enclosure receiving the deaerated

sample and a concentration sensor (16) receiving the deaerated centrifugate
from the conical, lower area (22) of said enclosure (20).
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that said deaeration
enclosure (20) is provided with means for eliminating foam in the form of

a slow stirrer (38).
Device according to either of the claims 4 and 5, characterized in that
the known concentration sensor (16) is placed in a second enclosure (24)

receiving in its lower part the centrifugate coming from the deaeration
enclosure (20). 
Device according to any one of the claims 4 to 6, characterized in that
it has a fast cleaning and rinsing system operating according to a predetermined

cycle in order to eliminate the formation and possible accumulation
of foam on the surface of said enclosure.
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that said fast cleaning
system of a periodic nature has means for ensuring a complete, rapid

emptying of the deaeration enclosure (20) and the second enclosure (24)
containing the concentration sensor, and means (34, 36) for admitting

pressurized water into said enclosures so as to ensure the rinsing, the
sensor signal being stored during said cleaning and rinsing phase, as well

as during the filling stage following onto said cleaning phase.
