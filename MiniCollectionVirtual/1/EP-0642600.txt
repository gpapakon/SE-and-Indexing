<ABSTRACT>
A device for producing a plasma polymer protective layer on workpieces, in particular headlamp reflectors (10), has a coating chamber (18) into which a polymerisable monomer may be introduced and in which microwaves generate in the area of the magnetic field of permanent magnets a plasma for depositing the polymer protection layer on workpieces held on workpiece carriers (11). The permanent magnets are arranged on the workpiece carriers (11). In addition, a transport device (12) which conveys the workpiece carriers (11) through the coating chamber (18) has a return section for the workpiece carriers (11) with a cleaning station (22) located outside the coating chamber (18) for returning the workpiece carriers (11) from the exit to the entrance of the coating chamber (18). The known ECR coating process can thus be implemented in an in line process as the magnets are continuously cleaned.

Apparatus for producing a plasma polymer protective 
layer on workpieces, in particular headlamp reflectors, 

having a coating chamber into which a polymerizable 
monomer can be introduced and having means for injecting 

microwaves into the coating chamber, with the microwaves 
producing, in the region of the magnetic field of 

permanent magnets, a plasma for depositing the polymer 
protective layer on the workpieces held on workpiece 

carriers, characterized in that the permanent magnets 
(24, 26) are arranged on the workpiece carriers (11), and 

in that there is provided a transport device (12) which 
conveys the workpiece carriers (11) through the coating 

chamber (18), which transport device possesses a return 
line, having a cleaning station (22), for the workpiece 

carriers (11) outside the coating chamber (18) for 
returning the workpiece carriers (11) from the exit to 

the entrance of the coating chamber (18). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the transport device (12) has a feed velocity 

corresponding to the production rhythm for the workpieces 
(10). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the plasma polymer coating chamber (18) is 

arranged between vacuum inlet and outlet locks. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the coating chamber (18) is 

preceded by a metallization chamber (17). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the metallization chamber (17) is preceded by a preglow 

chamber (16).  
 
Apparatus for producing a plasma polymer protective 
layer on headlamp reflectors according to any one of 

the preceding claims, characterized in that during use 
the permanent magnets (24) on the workpiece carriers (11) 

reach into the headlamp reflectors (10) arranged thereon. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the permanent magnets (24) reach through the lamp 

openings (25) of the headlamp reflectors (10) into the 
latter. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the headlamp reflectors (10) can be set into correspondingly 

configured recesses of the workpiece carriers 
(11) with the reflector opening facing upwards, with in 

each case at least one of the permanent magnets (24) 
reaching from below through the lamp opening (25) into 

the interior of the headlamp reflector (10). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the permanent magnet (24) reaching 

into the interior of the headlamp reflector (10) is 
fitted to a holding rod (23). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that further permanent magnets (26) are 

arranged on the periphery of the headlamp reflector. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cleaning station (12), 

at least for cleaning the permanent magnets (24, 26), has 
rotating brushes and/or an air cleaning device.
