<ABSTRACT>
Isobutene copolymers containing carboxyl groups, obtainable   a) by cationic polymerisation of a mixture of from 1 to 99 mol% of isobutene and from 99 to 1 mol% of a 2-methylalk-1-ene at temperatures below 20 DEG C in the presence of halogen-containing Lewis acids, and b) subsequent grafting of the resultant isobutene copolymers with alpha , beta -ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid derivatives at temperatures above 100 DEG C in the presence of initiators which decompose to form free radicals.   Carboxyl-containing isobutene copolymers of this type are particularly suitable as adhesive raw material or as sealants.

A carboxyl-containing isobutene copolymer, obtainable 

a) by cationic polymerization of a mixture of from 1 to 
99 mol% of isobutene and from 99 to 1 mol% of a 

2-methylalk-1-ene of 5 to 8 carbon atoms at less than 

20°C in the presence of a halogen-containing Lewis acid 
and 
b) subsequent grafting of the isobutene copolymer obtainable 
in this manner with an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic 

acid or carboxylic acid derivative at above 100°C 
and in the presence of a free radical initiator. 
A carboxyl-containing isobutene copolymer as claimed in claim 
1, wherein a mixture of 50 to 98 mol% of isobutene and from 

50 to 2 mol% of a 2-methylalk-1-ene of 5 to 8 carbon atoms is 
used in the cationic polymerization a). 
A carboxyl-containing isobutene copolymer as claimed in claim 
1 or 2, wherein the 2-methylalk-1-ene used is 2-methylpent-1-ene.
