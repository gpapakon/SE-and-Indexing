<ABSTRACT>
A dispersion of a finely divided pigment in a composition of 
water, one or more water-compatible resins and, as dispersant, a 

polycyclic aromatic compound having a water-solubilising 
poly(C₂₋₄-alkyleneoxy) chain containing from 3 to 50 alkyleneoxy groups, 

characterised in that the dispersion contains from 3% to 30% by weight 
or resin with respect to the total weight of water and resin in the 

dispersion. The dispersion is suitable for the preparation of water-borne 
paint and inks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous mill-base for 
water-borne paints and inks which contains pigment, water-insoluble 
resin and dispersant and to paints and packaging inks containing such 
millbases. Mill-bases for water-borne paints and inks are conventionally 
prepared by subjecting an aqueous dispersion of a pigment and one or 
more resins to a grinding operation in order to ensure that the pigment 
is finely divided and evenly distributed throughout the aqueous resin 
medium. Although the resin or resins used should be water-compatible, 
it is recognised that for optimum paint or ink (especially packaging 
ink) performance (especially durability) the resins used are preferably 
not water-soluble. Suitable water-insoluble resins may commonly be 
described as being water dilutable, water dispersible or emulsifiable. 
However, it has been found that water-insoluble resins do not generally 
provide sufficient dispersing power to ensure adequate dispersion of the 
pigment and it is therefore common practice to include water-soluble 
resins (which generally provide better dispersing power than insoluble 
resins) in such mill-bases with a consequent adverse effect on the 
performance of the derived paint or ink. It has now been found possible 
to provide mill-bases with well-dispersed pigments by the use of a 
specific class of dispersant. This permits the preparation of well-dispersed 
mill-bases containing water, water-insoluble resins, pigment 
and dispersant and little or no water-soluble resin. Surprisingly, the 
dispersant does not have an adverse effect on the performance of the 
paint or ink in the same way as the water-soluble resin. GB 2,060,715 discloses an aqueous dispersion of a finely-divided, 
water-insoluble, inorganic or non-ionic organic, solid 
containing a water-soluble, non-ionic, dispersing agent which comprises 
a polycyclic aromatic compound having a water-solubilising poly(lower 
alkyleneoxy) chain containing from 5 to 30 lower alkylene-oxy groups. 
The solid can be a pigment and the dispersion can be added to a PVA-acrylic 
co-polymer emulsion paint. The dispersion is prepared by 
milling the solid in water in the presence of the dispersing agent. It has now been found that aqueous mill-bases which are 
prepared by milling a pigment in water in the presence of both a 
dispersant and a water-insoluble resin exhibit advantage over the 
dispersion of GB 2,060,715 when the latter is added to an emulsion 
paint. According to the present invention there is provided an 
aqueous
