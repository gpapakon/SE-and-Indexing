<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention pertains to a process for preparing a fluid absorbent polymer wherein an ethylenically unsaturated monomer mixture is dispersed as droplets in an inert organic phase containing a hydrophobic suspending agent, such droplets being polymerized to form polymer particles having a hydrophobic surface, characterized in that the polymer particles are blended with a hydrophilic material in the absence of an organic solvent, such as to render the hydrophobic surface hydrophilic.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SURFACE TREATED ABSORBENT POLYMERSThe present invention relates to absorbents formed of water insoluble, hydrogel- forming, polymeric materials that are capable of absorbing many times their own weight upon contact with aqueous fluids. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing such absorbents.Many water-insoluble hydrogel -forming polymers are useful as absorbents, due to their ability to imbibe and bind or immobilize aqueous fluids. These polymeric materials find employment in industry for various dewatering and fluid immobilization uses, such as water retaining agents in agricultural/horticultural fields, dehydration of oil, and like purposes. In recent years absorbent polymers having large capacities for absorbing aqueous fluids have been developed and have found use in personal care products for absorbing aqueous biological fluids. In a typical personal care product, such as a diaper, the aqueous fluid absorbent polymer is utilized in powder form, and is often mixed with cellulosic fibers that help initially absorb and distribute the fluid load. The polymeric materials of interest in such products are based upon a variety of polymers, including those derived from water soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomers or graft polymers in which unsaturated monomers are graft polymerized onto a polysaccharide (such as starch or cellulose) or other polymeric backbone. A preferred absorbent material is derived from a water insoluble gel formed by copolymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid with a multifunctional crosslinking monomer. The acid monomer or polymer is substantially neutralized with an alkali metal hydroxide, dried and pulverized into a powder form, before use in a personal care product. A preferred polymer gel is a copolymer of acrylic acid/sodium acrylate and any of a variety of cross! inkers.Achieving desired polymeric characteristics that provide superior performance in a personal care product has long been a challenging goal of researchers. The product must perform for the user but also must be capable of being economically and safely made. At the customer/user level, a diaper, for example, should have a fast rate of absorption, adequate to imbibe and hold the fluid during absorption without leakage of fluid from the device in which it is employed. It is adequate fast rate, while maintaining all of the other desired qualities of the aqueous absorbent, that has often eluded prior researchers.Water-in-oil suspension polymerization processes
