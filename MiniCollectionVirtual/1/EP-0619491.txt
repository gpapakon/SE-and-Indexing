<CLAIMS>
A volumetrically and coulometrically operating titrating apparatus composed of a basic
unit (2) - whose housing has both a control device (22) for volumetric and coulometric

reagent metering and a mechanical actuating device (21) solely for volumetric reagent
metering - and of a volumetric dosing device (16) which is detachably secured to the

basic unit (2) and has mechanical coupling members (37) for connection to the actuating
device, the titrating apparatus additionally comprising a coulometric titrating chamber

(17) which is likewise detachably secured to the basic unit (2), either directly or by
means of an adaptor unit (18), and uses the same control device (22).
A titrating apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the coulometric
adaptor unit (18) is in the form of an interchangeable unit (23) whose devices are

connected to the basic unit (2) via detachable connecting lines.
A titrating apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the coulometric adaptor unit (18) and the volumetric dosing unit (16) are both

exchangeable units, and in that the basic unit (2) has a seat (24) for the volumetric dosing
unit (16).
A titrating apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the basic unit (2) has connections for mechanical and/or electrical connection

paths, upon association of the volumetric dosing unit (16) and/or the coulometric adaptor
unit (18) these connections being connected, preferably automatically, to mating

connections of the corresponding dosing/adaptor unit(s) (16, 18).
A titrating apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the control device (22) produces titration-serving electrical control pulses for

reagent metering, and in that these control pulses are used both to trigger the actuating
device (21) for the volumetric dosing unit (16) and to trigger the coulometric titrating

unit (10).
A titrating apparatus in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the control pulses
trigger a current generator of the coulometric adaptor unit (18), and in that the 

coulometric adaptor unit (18) has an interface device (27) for the connection of electrical
connections (28) to the coulometric titrating chamber (17).
A titrating apparatus in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the current
generator for the coulometric titrating unit is arranged in the basic unit (2), and in that the

basic unit (2) has an interface device (29) for the connection of the electrical connections
(28) to the coulometric titrating chamber (17), so that the latter is directly detachably

secured to the basic unit without use being made of an adaptor.
A titrating apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the volumetric dosing unit (16) for reagent dosing has a piston/cylinder unit (7)

whose coupleable piston drive arranged in the basic unit (2) is triggered by the control
pulses.
A titrating apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the coulometric adaptor unit is a separate unit with respect to the basic unit.
A titrating apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the coulometric adaptor unit is integrated in an agitator (6, 41) placed beside the

basic unit.
