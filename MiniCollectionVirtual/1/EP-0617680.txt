<ABSTRACT>
A chain gear has a variable diameter chain wheel (VDR) provided with continuous peripheric teeth formed by a ladder chain (ZK). The circumference of the chain wheel (VDR) provided with the ladder chain (ZK) adapts itself automatically to the available load moment. Resulting overlengths of the ladder chain (ZK) are stored inside the chain wheel (VDR). The driving chain (AK) is thus always uniformly engaged and drawn by many teeth (ZKZ) of the ladder chain (ZK). Since the traction force is distributed among many individual members of the ladder chain (ZK) and driving chain (AK) and is not only transmitted by a few elements, a uniform driving torque is obtained and said parts are subjected to little wear. The special design of the variable chain wheel (VDR) and ladder chain (ZK) further prevents modulation of the forces acting on the chain wheel (VDR).

Chain drive having a chain wheel (VDR) driven
by a drive shaft (W), which chain wheel has a variable

circumference, which is determined by at least two
radially displaceable segments (SE), which are enclosed

by at least two toothed chains (ZK1, ZK2) provided in
order to pull a driving chain (AK), which toothed

chains are held under tension, characterized in that
the driving chain (AK) only engages so far into the

circumference of the chain wheel (VDR) that each of the
toothed chains (ZK1, ZK2) is temporarily completely

released from the driving chain (AK) during each
revolution of the chain wheel (VDR), in that the first

chain link (KG1 or KG2) of each toothed chain (ZK1,
ZK2) is connected by way of a first elastic element

(ZF) to an associated segment (SE) and is displaceable
along the circumference of the chain wheel (VDR) at

least until the toothed chain (ZK1 or ZK2), in each
case released from the driving chain (AK), can again

engage into the driving chain (AK), and in that each of
the toothed chains (ZK1; ZK2) is held under tension by

a second elastic element (FE1; FE2) which pulls the end
of the supported toothed chain (ZK1; ZK2) into the

inside of the chain wheel.
Chain drive according to claim 1,
characterized in that the desired engagement of the

driving chain (AK) into the circumference of the chain
wheel (VDR) is adjusted in that the driving chain (AK)

is guided by way of an appropriately positioned
deflection roller (UR) to another chain wheel (VDR) or

a fixed gearwheel.
Chain drive according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the first and/or the second

elastic elements (ZF; FE1, FE2) are spring elements.
Chain drive according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the first elastic elements (ZF) 

are extendable up to a stop (SKFA) provided in the
segment (SE), and after the stop is reached the toothed

chain (ZK1; ZK2) rotates synchronously with the chain
wheel (VDR).
Chain drive according to claim 4,
characterized in that the first chain link (KG1 or KG2)

of each toothed chain (ZK1; ZK2) is connected by way of
at least two levers (PH) to a slide (SCH) which is

coupled to a first elastic element (ZF) and, limited by
the stop (SKFA), is displaceably mounted in the segment

(SE).
Chain drive according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the shaft (W) is connected to a

spiral-way plate (SBP) having at least one spiral-way
(SB), the spiral-way plate being rotatable relative to

a guideway plate (FBP) having at least one guideway
(FB), and in that the segments (SE) in the spiral-way

(SB) and the guideway (FB) are displaceably mounted.
Chain drive according to claim 6,
characterized in that the spiral-way plate (SBP) and

the guideway plate (FBP) are connected to each other by
way of a third elastic element (SFR).
Chain drive according to one of claims 1 or 7,
characterized in that the chain wheel (VDR) which is

driven by the shaft (W) or which drives the shaft (W)
is provided with damping elements so that large changes

of the torques acting on the chain wheel (VDR) do not
lead to sudden changes of the diameter of the chain

wheel (VDR).
Chain drive according to one of claims 1 or 7,
characterized in that the toothed chains (ZK1, ZK2)

have first and second chain links (KG1 and KG2) which
are arranged alternately and are rotatably connected to

each other, the clips (GS11; GS12 and GS21; GS22) of
which, connected to a base plate (PL1 and PL2), form a

U-section, with the base plate (PL1 and PL2) which is 
provided with a sprocket (ZKZ1 and ZKZ2), and the clips

(GS11; GS12 and GS21; GS22) which are connected to each
other on each side by bolts (VB1; VB2) being

dimensioned in such a way that each chain link (KG1 and
KG2) can take up a link of the roller chain in such a

way that its rollers, when resting on the edges of the
sprocket (ZKZ1 and ZKZ2) are arranged at least

approximately concentrically with respect to the bolts
(VB1, VB2).
Chain drive according to claim 9,
characterized in that the clips (GS11, GS12 and GS21,

GS22) are constructed in such a way that their
underside with the base plate (PL1 and PL2) connected

thereto is shorter than the distance between the
openings provided for leading the bolts (VB1, VB2)

through.
