 DESCRIPTION"A METAL CUTLERY ARTICLE WITH THE PART TO BE INSERTED IN THE MOUTH MADE TO BE DISPOSABLE"Technical FieldThe invention relates to a cutlery article which has been designed to resolve the problems of a hygienic and functional nature arising with cutlery articles of the type concerned.Background ArtA cutlery article must advantageously provide a high standard of hygiene, particularly for those articles which are inserted into the mouth during use, and may act as carriers of infection, especially in the case of use by more than one person. Problems of hygiene are present, for example, in public premises, cafeterias, hospital buildings, and the like. In these cases the hygiene of the cutlery is particularly important for the purposes of preventing contagion by infectious diseases. One solution which has been adopted hitherto is that of using disposable cutlery, made of plastic, to limit its cost and permit a single use thereof. However, this type of cutlery has two disadvantages. In the first place, the mechanical strength is relatively very low, and therefore this cutlery frequently breaks in use and is troublesome; to this is added the poor contribution of plastic cutlery to the esthetics of the table and the concept of excessive frugality. A further disadvantage of plastic cutlery is that it is not very resistant to high temperatures, at which it tends to become deformed or to break even more easily.Disposable metal cutlery is excessively expensive for the particularly large public refreshment sector, which cannot bear the cost of disposable metal cutlery.The invention is designed to resolve the problem both by providing sufficient economy and by providing a 

 particularly reassuring standard of hygiene.Disclosure of InventionTo this end, a cutlery article consists of a handle which may be used repeatedly, with one connectable end, and having a part to be used by carrying it to the mouth - such as the fork- or spoon-shaped part - to be provided sterilized and to be unsealed from a protective cover at the time of use and capable of connection to the handle to complete the cutlery article, only said part to be used being disposable and being intended to be discarded after use, while it may be offered to the user in the sealed state and consequently with the maximum assurance of hygiene.The connection may be made by an extension, with a housing for said extension and with an elastic retaining system with an elastic peg and an indentation, the whole designed to provide a stable coupling and

 CLAIMS
1. A cutlery article consisting of a handle which may be used repeatedly, with one connectable end, and having a part to be used by carrying it to the mouth - such as the fork- or spoon-shaped part - to be provided sterilized and to be unsealed at the time of use and capable of connection to the handle to complete the cutlery article, said part being disposable.
2. The cutlery article as claimed in the preceding claim, wherein the connection is made by an extension, with a housing for said extension, and with an elastic retaining system with a peg and an indentation.
3. The cutlery article as claimed in the preceding claims, wherein the extension is formed from the handle and includes the indentation (or the peg), the housing is formed by folding a sheet from which the part to be used is made, from which sheet an elastic extension forming the peg (or the indentation) is formed by cutting.
4. A handle or grip for a cutlery article, comprising, at one of its ends, a means of connection for expediently coupling to a part designed to be carried to the mouth.
5. A portion of a cutlery article designed to be carried to the mouth, such as the spoon- or fork-shaped part, comprising means of connection to a handle or grip.
