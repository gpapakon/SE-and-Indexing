<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerant transporting hose having a laminar structure 
including an inner tube consisting of at least one layer, an 

outer tube disposed radially outwardly of and coaxially with 
the inner tube, and a reinforcing fiber layer interposed 

between the inner and outer tubes. 
The hose has a sealing layer (20) formed on the 

inner surface of the inner tube. The sealing layer consists 
of a chlorinated elastomer containing a dispersion of an 

acid receptive agent. Alternately, the sealing layer (16) 
may be provided on the outer surface of a hose connector 

nipple (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
refrigerant transporting hose and a hose-connector combination
and more particularly to a hose suitable for use as a
refrigerant conduit for an automotive cooler or air
conditioner, and a hose-connector combination for connecting such a
refrigerant transporting hose.A hose having a three-layered integral laminar
structure is known as a conduit for transporting a
refrigerant such as flon gas (fluorohydrocarbon and
chlorofluorohydrocarbon). This three-layered hose consists
of an inner rubber layer, an outer rubber layer disposed
outwardly of the inner rubber layer, and a reinforcing fiber
layer interposed between the inner and outer rubber layers.
The inner rubber layer is generally formed of
acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber (NBR) or
chlorosulphonated polyethylene rubber (CSM), while the
reinforcing fiber layer has a mesh structure formed by
braided organic fiber yarn such as polyester fiber, rayon
fiber, or nylon fiber. The outer rubber layer is formed of
an elastomer (EPDM) consisting of a copolymer of ethylene, 
propylene and diene, or chloroprene rubber (CR). The outer
rubber layer has spiking holes formed from its surface down
to the reinforcing fiber layer, so that the flon gas which
has permeated through the inner rubber tube may escape
outside the hose, thereby preventing the gas from remaining
between the adjacent layers. The flon gas remaining between
the adjacent layers may cause local expansion at the
interfaces of the adjacent layers, resulting in undesired
separation of the layers from each other.This type of hose whose layers are formed solely
of rubber materials except for the reinforcing fiber layer
exhibits a high degree of flexibility, and is accordingly
easy to handle when the hose is installed in place as a
conduit. Further, the known hose indicated above has a high
sealing effect or fluid-tightness with respect to a
connector nipple or other hose joint. However, since a
rubber material, in particular, NBR and CSM commonly used
for the inner rubber layer, has some degree of gas
permeability, the known hose tends to suffer from leakage of
flon gas or other refrigerant, when the refrigerant has a
relatively low molecular weight. Namely, the conventional
hose which consists principally of such rubber materials
permits the refrigerant gas to permeate through its wall and
leaks out, whereby the amount of the refrigerant circulating
in a refrigerating system is gradually reduced, leading to
reduction in the cooling capacity of the
