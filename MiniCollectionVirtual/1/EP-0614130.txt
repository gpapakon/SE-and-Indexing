<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes a plurality of 
image carriers on each of which image is formed, a conveyor 

belt for carrying an image receiving medium, a driving 
roller on which the conveyor belt is mounted for driving the 

conveyor belt to convey the image receiving medium and a 
pressing roller for pressing the conveyor belt against the 

driving roller. The images formed on the image carriers are 
transferred seguentially to the image receiving medium 

conveyed by the conveyor belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image forming 
apparatus which form images on an image receiving medium 
using a plurality of photosensitive drums such as a color 
copying machine, etc. There is a color copying machine comprising four 
photosensitive drums arranged parallelly. On this type of 
copying machine, four photosensitive drums are arranged 
parallelly and toner images in different colors are formed 
on the respective photosensitive drums using yellow, 
magenta, cyanic and black toners. Each of these toner 
images is transferred and formed on a single sheet of paper. On the color copying machine using these four 
photosensitive drums, an image receiving medium placed on a 
conveyor belt are brought in contact with four 
photosensitive drums one by one and respective toner images 
are transferred from the drums onto the image receiving 
medium. Further, when forming an image other than color images, 
for instance, forming a black image only, no toner image is 
formed on three drums of yellow, magenta and cyanic drums  
 
and a black toner image is formed and transferred onto an 
image receiving medium. Thus, an image only in black is 
obtained. However, a conveyor belt is normally wound round 
driving rollers comprising rubber rollers and is moved by 
rotating the driving rollers. The largest reason for using 
rubber rollers is to prevent the conveyor belt from slipping 
against the driving rollers by making coefficient of 
statical friction of the rubber rollers with the conveyor 
belt large. Because, if the conveyor belt slips against the driving 
rollers, moving distances of copying papers being conveyed 
by the conveyor belt changes, causing a color shift on the 
image receiving medium in the conveying direction. That is, 
in order to prevent the conveyor belt from slipping against 
the driving rollers, it is desirable to use soft rubber 
rollers with hardness of rubber lowered. However, if a rubber roller is used, accuracy of the 
outer diameter of the driving roller drops and the more soft 
a rubber roller is, the more worse accuracy of the outer 
diameter of the driving roller will become. If accuracy of 
the outer diameter of the driving roller drops, the 
peripheral speed of the roller changes, making the conveying 
speed of the conveyor belt irregular and finally, a color 
shift is caused on copying papers in the conveying 
direction.  When a conveyor belt is used for a long time, its 
surface becomes dirty as toners and paper powder of the 
image receiving medium attach thereon and
