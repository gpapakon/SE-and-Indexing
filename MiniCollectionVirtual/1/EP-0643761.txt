<ABSTRACT>
A high quality lubricant for compressors operated during at least part of their compression cycle at temperatures above normal human comfort temperatures, such as most automotive air conditioners, especially those using chlorine free hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant working fluids, is provided by mixed esters of hindered polyols, most desirably pentaerythritol, with a mixture of carboxylic acids including at least some iso-pentanoic acid along with either or both of iso-nonanoic acid and dibasic acids such as adipic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of copending
International Application No. PCT/US92/04438 designating
the United States and filed June 3, 1992, the entire
disclosure of which, except to the extent contrary to any
explicit statement herein, is hereby incorporated herein
by reference.This invention relates to lubricant base stocks,
which can also serve as complete lubricants in some cases;
compounded lubricants, which include at least one additive
for such purposes as improving high pressure resistance,
corrosion inhibition, and the like along with the lubricant
base stocks which contribute the primary lubricity to
the compounded lubricants; refrigerant working fluids including
lubricants according to the invention along with
primary heat transfer fluids, and methods for using these
materials. The lubricants and lubricant base stocks are
generally suitable for use with most or all halocarbon
refrigerants and are particularly suitable for use with
substantially chlorine-free, fluoro-group-containing organic
refrigerating heat transfer fluids such as pentafluoroethane,
1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluroethane,
and tetrafluoroethanes, most particularly 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.
The lubricants and base stocks, in combination
with these heat transfer fluids, are particularly
suitable for lubricating compressors that operate at
temperatures substantially higher than those at which
humans can be comfortable; such compressors are generally
used, for example, in vehicle air conditioning.Chlorine-free heat transfer fluids are desirable for
use in refrigerant systems, because their escape into the
atmosphere causes less damage to the environment than the
currently most commonly used chlorofluorocarbon heat transfer
fluids such as trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane.
The widespread commercial use of chlorine-free
refrigerant heat transfer fluids has been hindered,
however, by the lack of commercially adequate lubricants.
This is particularly true for one of the most desirable
working fluids, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, commonly known
in the art as "Refrigerant 134a" or simply "R134a". Other
fluoro-substituted ethanes are also desirable working fluids.Esters of hindered polyols, which are defined for
this purpose as organic molecules containing at least five
carbon atoms, at least 2 -OH groups, and no hydrogen atoms
on any carbon atom directly attached to a carbon atom bearing
an -OH group, have already been recognized in the art
as high quality lubricant basestocks for almost any type
of
