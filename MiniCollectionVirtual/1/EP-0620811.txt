Heterocycl e-substituted benzyl amine derivatives as antiretroviral compounBackground of the inventionIn US-4,246,429 there are described a number of benzeneacetamides and thioamides being useful as intermediates in the preparation of phytopharmaceutical compounds. Unexpectedly, it has now been found that some analogous heterocyclic compounds effectively inhibit the replication of HIV and consequently may be useful for the treatment of individuals infected by HIN, in particular HIN-1.Description of the invention. The present invention is concerned with compounds having the formula
 the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms and the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, whereinR1 and R2 each independently are halo or methyl; R3 is hydrogen, halo, nitro or trifluoromethyl; R is - trifluoromethyl or methylcarbonyl ; or- a radical -C(=X)-ΝR5R6 wherein X is O or S, and R5 and R6 each independently are hydrogen or Ci^alkyl; or- a radical -Alk-R7, wherein Alk is Ci^alkanediyl; and R7 is hydrogen or hydroxy;Het is a heterocyclic radical of formula :
