<ABSTRACT>
In a unit for lifting the forks of lift trucks 
using one or more single-acting hydraulic cylinders 

(19) to lift or lower the forks, in two opposite 
end-of-travel strokes of the piston (31) of the 

hydraulic cylinder (19), interception means (37, 34) 
determine a reduction in the cross-section of the 

working fluid outflow respectively from a first 
chamber (44) and from a second chamber (45) of 

variable volumes inside the hydraulic cylinder (19); 
this brakes the travel of the piston (31) and thus 

of the actuating rod (33), which is integral with 
the latter, preventing abrupt stresses being applied 

to the load on the forks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is a unit
for lifting the forks of lift trucks.As is known, lift trucks are provided with a
fork lifting unit having at least one single-acting
hydraulic cylinder kinematically connected to the
forks. The hydraulic cylinder has a cylindrical body
in which there is slideably mounted a piston
coaxially integral with an actuating rod. In order
to lift the forks, the hydraulic cylinder is
supplied with working fluid from a pump through a
hydraulic distributor such that the actuating rod of
the hydraulic cylinder moves the forks upwards. The
forks are lowered by gravity, the hydraulic cylinder
always being connected for discharge through the
hydraulic distributor.The forks are secured to a plate which slides
along a frame during the said lifting and lowering
movements. The frame can be of simple construction
or telescopic and the number of hydraulic cylinders
can vary according to the type of lift truck. Some
types of lift trucks with telescopic frames are
provided for example with a pair of hydraulic
cylinders the action of which causes the forks to
rise and the frame to extend simultaneously, by 
virtue of suitable kinematic components. Other types
of lift trucks with telescopic frames are provided
with a third hydraulic cylinder in addition to the
pair of hydraulic cylinders; in this case, the third
hydraulic cylinder lifts the forks when the frame is
not extended whilst the pair of hydraulic cylinders
merely extend the frame. In all cases, the lowering
movement of the forks corresponds to the lifting
movement.During these fork lifting and lowering
movements, the hydraulic cylinders reach the end of
their travel somewhat abruptly even though the
operator usually reduces the inflow and outflow
speed of the working fluid in the hydraulic
cylinders, acting suitably on the hydraulic
distributor, as they reach the end of their travel.This evidently disturbs the load on the forks
with undesirable consequences such as the shifting
of the load itself or the movement or even the
breaking of elements constituting the load, etc.The situation is aggravated in cases in which,
for example, the operator is distracted and forgets
to reduce the inflow and outflow speed of the
working fluid in the hydraulic cylinders. In this
case, the hydraulic cylinders reach the end of their 
travel violently, which can have serious
consequences such as the dropping of the load,
breakage of the load, etc.The object of the present invention is to overcome
the said disadvantages. A unit having the

<CLAIMS>
A lifting unit (11), for the forks (12) of lift
trucks (10), having at least one single-acting

hydraulic cylinder (18; 19) kinematically connected
to the forks (12) and comprising a cylindrical body

(30) in which slides a piston (31) which is integral
with an actuating rod (33), the forks (12) being

lifted as a result of the hydraulic cylinder (18;
19) being supplied with working fluid and the forks

(12) being lowered by gravity, discharging the
working fluid, wherein between the

piston (31) and a base (36) of the cylindrical body
(30) is defined a first internal chamber (44)

communicating with at least one duct (39) for the
inflow and outflow of the working fluid; wherein

between the rod (33) and the cylindrical body (30)
is defined a second internal chamber (45) opposite

the first chamber (44) with respect to the piston
(31) and communicating with the said first chamber

(44); and wherein first interception means are
provided which, during an end-of-travel stroke of

the piston (31) towards the said base (36),
determine a narrowing of the cross-section of the

fluid outflow from the first chamber (44) to the

first interception means comprise a tang (37) which is either

integral with the base (36) of the cylindrical body (30) or with
