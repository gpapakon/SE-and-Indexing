<ABSTRACT>
A delta doped layer is used at a heterointerface semiconductor mirror in 
a vertical cavity laser to reduce the series resistance of the laser. The layer, in a 

preferred embodiment, is in the mirror having p-type conductivity, because of the 
greater resistance in the p-type region than in the n-type region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor devices having at least one 
highly doped region between dissimilar bandgap regions. Most semiconductor devices, for example, field effect and bipolar 
transistors, lasers, etc., must be electrically contacted. The electrical contact 
frequently requires ohmic or Schottky barrier contacts to particular portions of the 
device. In addition to the formation of the electrical contacts, minimization of power 
consumption by the devices is also invariably desirable. This is true of devices, such 
as semiconductor lasers, which produce light output in response to electrical current 
passing through the device. Optimum performance requires minimization of 
electrical resistance within the device. Minimization of the electrical power required 
for a given optical power output results in a more efficient device and fewer adverse 
effects caused by ohmic heating. However, obtaining desirable electrical 
characteristics is frequently complicated by the constraint that the device have the 
desired optical characteristics. Reduction of electrical resistance is frequently more 
difficult with compound semiconductors than with elemental semiconductors, for 
example, silicon, because of the presence of heterointerfaces and energy band 
discontinuities in the compound semiconductors. The compound semiconductors 
may be Group II-VI, Group III-V or Group IV compound semiconductors. One type of device that exemplifies the problems associated with 
forming the electrical contact and reducing the electrical resistance is termed the 
vertical cavity surface emitting laser. Such lasers are attractive for diverse 
applications because they have a small area and beam divergence and can be 
produced with planar technology thereby avoiding cleaved mirrors. These lasers 
have a p-i-n structure and there are n- and p-type distributed mirrors on opposite 
sides of the active region. The mirrors in vertical cavity lasers may be formed by 
pairs of high and low refractive index semiconductor layers fabricated so that they 
form quarter wavelength layers. For example, the mirrors may be formed from 
AlGaAs with adjacent layers having different Al concentrations thereby producing 
the desired difference in refractive index. Of course, the different Al concentrations 
in the AlGaAs layers produce compound semiconductors with different bandgaps, 
i.e., there are heterointerfaces within the mirrors. However, if the layers are 
sufficiently thick so that tunneling currents through the bandgap
