<DESCRIPTION>
Papers containing aramid floc and fibrids with or 
without special ingredients such as quartz fiber have 
been proposed for use as substrates for electronic 
printed wiring boards. This end-use places a number of 
demands on the substrates, such as good mechanical 
properties along with high porosity to make it easier to 
impregnate with resins. Papers of this type are 
generally prepared by a wet process using a papermaking 
machine. The wet-laid sheets are drained, dried and 
calendered. The resulting papers are of limited strength and porosity. 
The process disclosed in US-A-5 026 456 seeks to solve this problem, 
however, this document teaches away from the invention since it 
provides for adjustment of the porosity of aramid papers by compositional 
changes. - A process for heat treating a calendered web comprising 
only aromatic polyamide fibres is known from JP-A-52 105 975. The 
purpose of this process, however, is to obtain a high temperature 
resistant sheet. The process of the present invention 
upgrades the tensile properties of the calendered product 
while increasing its porosity. This invention provides a process for increasing 
the tensile strength and porosity of calendered paper 
consisting essentially of from 45 to 97 weight % of 
poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) floc, from 3 to 30 
weight % of poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) fibrids and 
from 0-35 weight % of quartz fiber, comprising heating 
the paper, free of applied pressure, at a temperature of 
at least 249°C (480°F), for at least 12 seconds but no more than 
100 seconds, preferably at least 265°C (510°F) for 20 to 30 
seconds. In the wet forming process of making papers to be 
treated in accordance with the present invention, an 
aqueous slurry of short fibers, under 1.27 cm (0.5 inches) long of 
poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPD-T) and fibrids of 
poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (MPD-I) and optionally,  
 
other short fibers is prepared and a sheet is formed from 
the slurry using a paper making machine. The sheet is 
dried and calendered before being subjected to the 
process of the invention. More specifically, an aqueous slurry is prepared 
which contains between 0.005% and 0.02% by weight of 
solids which comprise from 45 to 97% by weight of short 
(less than 1.27 cm (0.5 inch) long) fibers of PPD-T, 3 to 30% by 
weight of MPD-I fibrids and 0 to 35% by weight of short 
(less than 1.27 cm (0.5 inch) long) quartz fibers. It is important 
that the fibrids not exceed 30 wt. %. The use of greater 
amounts of MPD-I
