<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printed, fiber materials and methods
of preparing them. In particular, the applications of the invention
concern fiberglass materials and methods of printing thereon. A particular
embodiment described is printed orthopedic casting tapes. The invention also
concerns compositions usable for the printing of materials such as knitted
fiberglass fabric used in orthopedic casting tapes.While the methods, compositions and materials presented herein may
be used in a variety of applications, they were specifically developed with
respect to orthopedic casting tapes. Therefore, as background, characterizations
of technology relating to orthopedic casting tapes and problems
overcome by the present invention are provided.Orthopedic casting tapes have been produced using curable resins
coated on a substrate. Typically, the casting tape is stored as a roll, in a
water impermeable storage pouch, until needed for use. It is then removed
from the pouch, cut to length, if necessary, and soaked with water.
Generally, the tape includes a resin therein which is water-curable, and thus
shortly after the tape is dipped in water it begins to cure and harden. The
medical personnel, applying the tape to a patient, apply the casting tape
immediately after it has been soaked with water. Generally, resin materials
are chosen which will begin to set within a few minutes after the soaking with
water, and which will harden sufficiently to be weight bearing within about
15 to 30 minutes.Examples of such orthopedic casting tapes are described in U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,667,661 and 4,774,937 to Scholz et al., the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Patents '661 and '937 are both owned
by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, Minnesota,
the assignee of the present invention.Orthopedic casting tapes of the type briefly described above are
commercially available. For example, Scotchcast® 2 casting tape; Scotchcast®
PLUS casting tape and Scotchcast® 3 casting tape, are available from 3M
Company. In general, it is desired that the casting tape be constructed from a
fabric or substrate which is relatively stretchable; i.e., which has an
extensibility of at least about 15 to 25 percent, preferably at least about 20
percent, once coated with the uncured resin. This will facilitate fitting the
casting tape around contoured portions of the body, such as the heel, knee or
elbow. A preferred fiber material from which such stretchable casting tapes
can be formed is fiberglass.
