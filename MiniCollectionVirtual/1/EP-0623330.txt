<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an infant's diaper,
toilet training shorts, and a disposable diaper for the use
of an adult or an incontinent person, and particularly to
a shorts type disposable diaper.Conventional disposable diapers are mostly
of the flat type, as described in EP-A-529 681, in which
a flat diaper body is placed against the wearer and
thereafter fastened by a tape fastener. For discarding
such flat type diapers after use, the diapers are rolled up
in such a manner as to contain discharged materials
and then fastened by the tape fastener adapted to this
purpose.Recently, there has been developed a so-called
shorts type diaper in which side portions thereof
are preliminarily fixedly connected without using any
tape fastener. Various kinds of shorts type diapers of
this type are proposed, including one in which gathers
are provided at a waist portion and leg portions, for
example. (Japanese Laid Open Patent Application Nos.
Sho 58-115106, Sho 58-115107, Sho 62-231005, etc.)
These shorts type diapers can all be worn by the wearer
in a standing condition as in the case with the normal
undergarments. They are intended to be used not only
by infants as diapers, but also by month-wise aged
babies (babies of about eight to twelve months old) as a
toilet training wear, or by incontinent persons and adults
as a diaper.However, since those shorts type diapers
are not provided with a tape fastener, the diapers rolled
up for discarding cannot be fastened and are therefore
difficult to be discarded. If the discharged materials contained
in the diapers are soft feces or loose bowels having
high fluidity, they are sometimes exposed outside.
This is problematical also from a sanitary aspect when
the diapers are to be discarded.Although those conventional shorts type disposable
diapers have such advantage as having a flexible
fitness to a month-wise aged baby moving actively,
they have such disadvantage that they are difficult to
well fit wearers of all sizes within the limit of the expansibility
of the gathers (that is, only with the aid of the
expansibility of the gathers). As a result, the wearer's
skin is damaged by the elasticity of the gathers and the
diaper is slipped down to permit the discharged materials
in the diaper to leak outside.Furthermore, the conventional shorts type
disposable diaper has the additional problems in that
the discharged materials in the diaper, in use, cannot be
seen from outside, at least one side of the diaper must
be torn off in order to handle the discharged materials,
and

<CLAIMS>
A shorts type disposable diaper (1) comprising:

a front waist portion (5A) including elastically
expansible members (7) and a rear waist portion

(5B) including elastically expansible members
(7); said front and rear waist portions (5A,

5B) defining a waist portion, opposing lateral
side portions and a pair of leg openings, each

of said leg openings including elastically
expansible members (7);
a liquid permeable topsheet (2);
a liquid impermeable backsheet (3);
an absorber (4) interposed between said
topsheet (2) and said backsheet (3);

the front and rear waist portions (5A, 5B) being
connected together at the opposing lateral side

portions to form shorts having a front and a
rear surface area with a waist opening, and

having said pair of leg openings;

a strip-shaped tape fastener (10) positioned at
a central section of the rear surface area of the

diaper (1), substantially laterally between the
opposing side portions and below the elastically

expansible members (7) of said rear waist
portion, on an outer surface of said backsheet

(3); opposing longitudinal ends of said tape fastener
(10) being oriented in a direction substantially

parallel to said opposing side
portions, with one of said longitudinal ends

being a fixed portion (11) that is secured to the
outer surface of the diaper (1), and said tape

fastener (10) being folded in a longitudinal
direction thereof, and 
the other longitudinal end
being a fastening portion (12) for fastening the

diaper upon disposal of a used diaper; and

said tape fastener (10) being positioned
entirely on the rear surface area of said diaper

(1) in non-use, and extended and wrapped over
said waist opening to form a roll structure upon

disposal, whereby said diaper is discarded in a
sanitary manner.
The disposable diaper according to claim 1,
wherein said tape fastener (10) further comprises

an intermediate portion (16) connecting said fixed
portion (11) and said fastening portion (12), said

tape fastener (10) being folded in three layers comprising
said fixed portion (11); said intermediate

portion (16) and said fastening portion (12), respectively.
The disposable diaper according to claim 2,
wherein said tape fastener (10) includes an adhesive

area (14) and a peelable area, said adhesive
area (14) and said peelable area (13) being superimposed

under said three layers so as to contact
