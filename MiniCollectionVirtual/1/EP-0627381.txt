<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
catalytically producing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen 
and oxygen in a reaction medium. An anthraquinone process, an electrolytic process, 
an isopropyl alcohol oxidation process and the like have 
been known as a process for the production of hydrogen 
peroxide, and the anthraquinone process has mainly been 
adopted commercially. In this process, an anthraquinone 
derivative is reduced and oxidized in a nonaqueous 
solvent system to produce hydrogen peroxide which is then 
extracted with water and distilled to give a product. 
This process is not always ideal for producing hydrogen 
peroxide due to drawbacks such as complexity of the 
process or a deterioration in the anthraquinone solution. In order to solve the above-described problem, a 
number of proposals have been made on a process for 
producing hydrogen peroxide directly from hydrogen and 
oxygen. For examples, Japanese Examined Patent 
Publication (Kokoku) No. 56-47121 proposes a process for 
producing hydrogen peroxide wherein hydrogen oxide is 
produced in an aqueous acidic solution in the presence of 
a catalyst comprising a hydrous silicic acid carrier and 
5% palladium supported thereon. In such a reaction 
system, however, it is difficult to avoid elution of 
palladium as the catalyst from the carrier, so that the 
proposed process has a problem of the service life of the 
catalyst. In U.S. Patent No. 4,681,751, activated carbon 
is used as the carrier to prepare a palladium-containing 
metallic catalyst for the production of hydrogen 
peroxide. Activated carbon has a high capability of 
adsorbing palladium, so that the elution can be 
relatively suppressed. However, the effect attained by  
 
this method is not satisfactory. In Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 3-103310, an amino acid 
exists in a reaction medium to reduce the elution of iron 
ions from a reactor for the purpose of improving the 
selectivity of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide. The effect 
attained by this method too is not satisfactory. An 
attempt to improve the selectivity of hydrogen to 
hydrogen peroxide has been made by using, as the 
catalyst carrier, cerium oxide in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 4-238802, lanthanum oxide 
in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 4-285003, 
crystalline silica or a zeolite having a high 
silica content in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
(Kokai) No. 5-17106 or a mixed oxide comprising zirconium 
oxide and vanadium oxide in
