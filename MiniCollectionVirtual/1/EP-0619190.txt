<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
output method in an operation unit in an information
output apparatus for generating output information on
the basis of input information which was input from the
outside and also relates to an information output
apparatus having such an operation unit.Fig. 18 is a plan view showing an example of an
operation panel of such a kind of information output
apparatus.In the diagram, reference numeral 200 denotes an
operation panel unit having a liquid crystal display
(LCD) 201 which can display about 16 or more
characters, a key input unit 203 including seven or
more key portions, and the like in order to realize
complicated display and operation. Reference numeral
202 denotes a state display.By using the operation panel with such a
construction as mentioned above, a state and errors of
the apparatus can be displayed, an output environment
can be changed, and other special operations such as
output of a list of output environment or a list of 
fonts and resetting processing can be executed.Such a kind of apparatus has one or a plurality of
control code analyzing means and generally doesn't
judges whether input data is data which can be printed
by the apparatus or not. An output processing is
executed by using either one of the control code
analyzing means.For example, in a conventional printing apparatus,
there has been proposed a printing apparatus such that
data is received from a host computer on a page unit
basis, a character code or graphics data which was
transmitted from the host computer is developed into a
bit map, image data transmitted from the host computer
is developed, or an external character font or logotype
is developed, thereby forming bit map information as
output information on a page unit basis and printing
and outputting.A printing mechanism (printer engine) which is
provided for the printing apparatus is generally
constructed in the following manner. The bit map
information of the page unit mentioned above is
converted into the video signal and is developed into
the print data and is transferred to the printing
mechanism. In the printing mechanism, in order to
execute an electrophotographic processing such that the
image corresponding to the page unit bit map
information is formed onto a photosensitive drum by a 
developing agent such as a toner or the like
synchronously with the video signal by using a light
emitting device such as laser beam, LED array, liquid
crystal shutter, or the like, the developed image is
copy transferred onto a
