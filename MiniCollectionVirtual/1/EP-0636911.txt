<ABSTRACT>
A structure and a method for coupling an optical 
semiconductor and an optical waveguide with high accuracy and 

productivity is disclosed. The semiconductor is mounted on a 
first substrate which is formed with a groove. A short optical 

fiber is received in the groove such that it is positioned at the 
same height as the light emitting portion of the semiconductor. 

The waveguide is formed on a second substrate while a groove 
is formed in the second substrate on the imaginary extension of 

the waveguide. The upper half of the short fiber is received in 
the groove of the second substrate, so that the fiber and 

waveguide are coupled to each other. To position the 
semiconductor relative to the first substrate, marks are 

provided on the mounting surface of the semiconductor and the 
surface of the first substrate and implemented by thin films 

which are opaque for infrared rays. The position of the 
semiconductor is adjusted by the steps of radiating infrared 

rays, calculating the areal centers of gravity of the marks, and 
moving the semiconductor until the areal centers of gravity 

align with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical waveguide type
device having an optical semiconductor and an optical
waveguide and, more particularly, to a structure for coupling
the semiconductor and waveguide, and a coupling method of the
same.Optical waveguide type devices, like optical connectors are
disclosed, e.g., in EP-A-0 331 334, DE-A-4 013 630 or EP-A-0
318 267. Further, US-A-4 639 074 discloses an optical fiber-to-waveguide coupler.Optical waveguide type devices, like electronic devices,
can be produced on a quantity basis and can be provided with
advanced functions and a highly integrated configuration. To
further enhance the functions and integration, there is available
a coupling structure having an optical semiconductor in a
waveguide type device and connects the semiconductor directly
to an optical waveguide.It has been customary with the structure optically
coupling the optical semiconductor to the optical waveguide to
cause the semiconductor to emit light by flowing a current
therethrough, and monitor light coming out of the waveguide so
as to adjust the position of the semiconductor. A coupling
structure capable of coupling an optical semiconductor to an
optical waveguide without any positional adjustment is 
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. 61-87113. In this kind of coupling structure, a
guide is formed on an optical waveguide substrate beforehand,
and an optical member and optical semiconductor are fitted in
the guide.To couple an optical semiconductor to an optical
waveguide via a lens with efficiency, it is necessary that the
semiconductor and lens be each positioned with accuracy less
than about 1 Âµm relative to the waveguide. The conventional
coupling structure mentioned above positions the
semiconductor and lens by the guide without adjustment, so
that the guide has to be provided with an extremely accurate
configuration. However, this is extremely difficult since the
guide suffers from errors when formed by patterning or etching.
Another problem is that a step of forming the guide is needed in
addition to a step of forming the waveguide, complicating the
entire process and, therefore, limiting productivity. In
addition, since the guide is located in the vicinity of the end of
the waveguide, it is impossible to measure, before mounting the
semiconductor, the loss and other characteristics of the
waveguide by abutting an optical fiber against the end of the
waveguide. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
couple an optical
