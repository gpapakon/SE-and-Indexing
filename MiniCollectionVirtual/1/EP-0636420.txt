<ABSTRACT>
Powder conveying device, in particular for coating powder, having an injector (2) in which a partial vacuum is produced by means of a conveying air stream according to the principle of a Venturi tube and powder is sucked out of a powder container (10) and transported. A supplementary air stream can be added to the conveying air stream. A plurality of predetermined powder conveying rates (m) as a first axis of a diagram and a plurality of conveying air rates (FV) as a second axis of a diagram for specific overall air rates (GV) (conveying air and if appropriate supplementary air) are stored in a computer (24) as a calibration plot (50). The computer (24) contains a desired value input (52) for powder rates for inputting a selected desired value (m-Soll) for the powder rates and calculates, as a function of the predetermined overall air rate (GV) the conveying air rate (FV) required for this and the supplementary air rate required and generates a desired conveying air rate value (FV-Soll) and a desired supplementary air rate value (ZV-Soll) as a function of the result of the calculation.
