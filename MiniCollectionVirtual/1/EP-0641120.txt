<ABSTRACT>
A telefacsimile-type apparatus (1,2) for transmitting and 
receiving includes automatic message-enveloping means 

(12,22). 
The apparatus (2) further includes means (231) for delivering 
an identity signal concerning the possible availability 

of an enveloping facility, upon receiving a call from 
another apparatus (1); means (132) for receiving an identity 

signal concerning the possibility of an enveloping 
facility from another (2) apparatus; and means (133) for 

sending to the called apparatus (2) a control signal in 
response to a separate identity signal received from the 

called apparatus (2), and in response to the setting of 
activating means (1331) having one setting which corresponds 

to ordering a transmitted message to be enveloped 
and another setting which corresponds to ordering the 

message not to be enveloped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to message transmitting and 
receiving apparatus, more particularly to apparatus of the 
telefacsimile kind that are provided with means for automatically 
enveloping received messages. It is known, for instance, from U.S. Patent Specification 
5 031 379 to provide message receiving apparatus of the 
kind equipped with a paper store and a printing mechanism 
for printing messages onto paper sheets taken from said 
store, and a store of enveloping material for emveloping 
sheets that carry printed messages, with a closed casing 
which houses means for bundling printed sheets together as 
they are printed and means for enveloping the bundled 
sheets with enveloping material taken from the enveloping 
material store. Such apparatus effectively prevent uncontrolled spreading 
of transmitted and printed messages. Over a transition period there will be found installed 
apparatus that do not include this enveloping function and 
apparatus which do include said function, and consequently 
a person transmitting from a telefacsimile apparatus cannot 
always be certain that a contemplated receiver has apparatus 
which includes this enveloping function. The sender 
will then perhaps elect to send the message in another way 
(by letter), in order to be certain that the message will 
not be spread in an uncontrolled manner. It may also be so that the person sending a message knows 
that the receiver has apparatus with which a received 
message is securely and safely enveloped, but that in 
certain cases the nature of the message is not such as to 
require such strenuous (and perhaps more expensive)  
 
security against spreading of the message and/or that the 
message should rather reach the addressee at the receiving 
apparatus as quickly as possible. The object of the present invention is to improve the 
senders possibility of transmitting a message more securely 
and more quickly than is possible at present, in a controlled 
fashion. An apparatus of the aforesaid kind and constructed in 
accordance with the present invention includes means for 
delivering a separate identity signal concerning enveloping 
possibilities, upon receipt of a call from another apparatus; 
means for receiving from another apparatus a separate 
identity signal concerning enveloping possibilities; and 
means for transmitting control signals to called apparatus 
in response to a separate identity signal earlier received 
from called apparatus and in response to the occurrent 
setting of a separate activating

<CLAIMS>
A telefacsimile-type message transmitting and receiving 
apparatus (1,2) provided with means (12,22) for automatically 

enveloping a received message, characterized by means 
(231) for delivering a separate identity signal relating to 

an enveloping possibility upon receipt of a call from 
another calling apparatus (1); 

means (132) for receiving from another, called apparatus 
(2) a separate identity signal concerning an enveloping 

possibility; 
means (133) for sending to said called apparatus (2) a 

control signal in response to a separate identity signal 
earlier received from said called apparatus (2) and in 

response to the setting of a separate activating means 
(1331) having one setting which corresponds to ordering 

the enveloping of a subsequently sent message and another 
setting which corresponds to ordering the message not to be 

enveloped.
