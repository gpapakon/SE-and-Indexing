<ABSTRACT>
A triggering circuit for a crash-sensor-controlled (A) protective system for the passengers in a vehicle, with an ignition capacitor (C) charged to a voltage (U) by the vehicle's electric system (N) before an accident as the power source to ignite a gas generator (Z), i.e. to ignite an explosive charge or a detonator (Z) of said charge and with at least one crash sensor (A) which detects the occurrence of the sensor reading triggering ignition and controls the ignition of the gas generator by the discharge of the ignition capacitor via one or more contacts (S, T). Several ignition capacitors are commutatable; they are connected in parallel before an accident and charged to the voltage of the vehicle's electrical system and, on the occurrence of an accident, are low-ohmically connected in series via a single contact in such a way that, at least at the start of ignition, the total voltage (V) across this series circuit is greater than the individual capacitor voltages. The total voltage can be supplied low-ohmically to the gas generator via at least a single contact.

Triggering circuit for a crash sensor-controlled 
(A) protective system for the occupant of a vehicle, for 

example an air bag or seatbelt retractor arrangement, 

having a firing capacitor (C), which is charged 
before the accident to a capacitor voltage (U) from 

the vehicle's electrical system (N), as energy 
source for firing a gas generator (Z), that is to 

say for firing an explosive charge or for firing a 
firing cap (Z) of the explosive charge, and 
having at least one crash sensor (A), 

•• which detects the occurrence of the sensor values 
which trigger the firing and 
•• which controls, by means of one or more contacts 
(S, T), the firing of the gas generator (Z) by 

discharging the firing capacitor (C), 
 
characterized in that 


a plurality of firing capacitors (C) are provided in 
a switching-over manner 


•• which (C) are in fact connected in parallel 
before the accident and then charged to a 

capacitor voltage which corresponds to the voltage 
(U) of the vehicle's electrical system, and 
•• which (C) are connected, in the case of the accident, 
in a low-impedance manner, by means of at 

least one single contact (S, T), in series in 
such a way that, at least at the start of firing, 

the instantaneous total voltage (V), via this 
series connection is greater than the individual 

capacitor voltages (U) in themselves, and 
in that the total voltage (V) can be fed in a low-impedance  
 

manner to the gas generator (Z) by means 
of at least a single contact (S, T). 
Triggering circuit according to Patent Claim 1, 
characterized 


in that, at the start of firing, in fact directly 
after the actuation of the contact/contact(s) 

(S, T), the firing capacitors (C) are disconnected 
from the vehicle's electrical system (N) in a high-impedance 

manner (R1, R2, R4, possibly also D1, D2, 
D3) so that then as a result of this disconnection 


•• the total voltage (V) is greater than the voltage 
(U, U1) in the vehicle's electrical system (N) 

and 
•• the currents of the firing capacitors (C) flow 
essentially via the gas generator (Z) / gas 

generators (Z) instead of via the vehicle's electrical 
system (N). 
Triggering circuit according to Patent Claim 2, 
characterized 


in that the high-impedance disconnection of at least 
part of the firing capacitors (C) from the vehicle's 

electrical system (N) is then formed by in each case 
at least one high-impedance resistor (R1, R2, R3, 

R4, D1) via which (R, D) the charging of the respective 
firing capacitors (C) also took place before 

the accident. 
Triggering circuit according to Patent Claim 2 or 
3, characterized 


in that the high-impedance disconnection is then 
formed by at least one diode (D) which has low 

impedance for the charging of the firing capacitors 
(C) and high impedance for the capacitor firing 

current which occurs in the case of an accident as 
long as the respective instantaneous firing 

capacitor voltage is greater than the instantaneous 
voltage (U, U1) in the vehicle's electrical system 

(N). 
Triggering circuit according to one of the  
 

preceding patent claims, characterized 

in that a parallel connection (S3, D2, D3) is provided 
for the series connection, formed in the case 

of an accident, of the firing capacitors (C), the 
parallel connection (S3, D2, D3) connecting, in the 

case of an accident, the voltage source (B) of the 
vehicle's electrical system (N) to the gas generator 

(Z), and 
in that the parallel connection (S3, D2, D3) 
contains a contact (S3) which closes in the case of 

an accident, and a diode (D2, D3) with such a 
polarity that in the case of an accident a firing 

current of the vehicle's electrical system is 
conducted out of the voltage source (B) of the 

vehicle's electrical system (N) via the gas 
generator (Z) with a residual voltage (V) which 

occurs via the gas generator (Z), 

•• for at least as long as the vehicle's electrical 
system (N) is intact and 
•• for at least as long as the residual voltage (V) 
which can be fed to the gas generator (Z) from 

the vehicle's electrical system (N) is greater 
than the instantaneous total voltage (V12) of the 

firing capacitors (C) connected in series. 
Triggering circuit according to one of the 
preceding patent claims, characterized 


in that more firing capacitors (C) than gas generators 
(Z) are provided, and 
in that each firing capacitor (C) is permanently 
assigned to a gas generator (Z) but the further 

firing capacitor (C) or the further firing 
capacitors (C) are assigned to a plurality of gas 

generators (Z), so that in the case of an accident 
the series connection, which supplies one gas 

generator (Z) with firing energy, of the firing 
capacitors (C) contains in each case one firing 

capacitor (C) which is permanently assigned to the 
respective gas generator (Z), and at least one  

 
further firing capacitor (C). 
Triggering circuit according to Patent Claim 6, 
characterized 


in that each permanently assigned firing capacitor 
(C) is assigned its own firing switch (S, T), and 
in that an electronic evaluation system (P) which 
evaluates the sensor values controls one or more of 

the firing switches (T) individually in such a way 
that the firing of the gas generators (Z) takes 

place at different times. 
Triggering circuit according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized 


in that at least one of the crash sensors (A) is a 
safing sensor (A), that is to say a particularly 

sensitive sensor (A), whose (A) analog or digital 
output signals, exclusively or additionally, permit 

decelerations or accelerations to be clearly 
detected, which decelerations or accelerations still 

lie below that threshold above which the gas 
generator (Z) is fired. 
Triggering circuit according to one of the 
preceding claims, preferably according to Patent Claim 8, 

characterized 

in that at least one crash sensor (A1) supplies 
analog output signals which are converted by means 

of an electronic evaluation device formed by a 
microprocessor (P) into one or more ON/OFF signals 

which control one or more contacts (T5, T6, T2). 
Triggering circuit according to one of the 
preceding patent claims, characterized 


in that one or more current sources (W) or voltage 
sources are temporarily connected (T7) to one or 

more switching points, 
in that, in the case of the test, currents flowing 
via the gas generator (Z) are at least smaller than 

would be necessary to fire the gas generator (Z), 
and 
in that, at least in the case of the test, measuring  
 

points of the triggering circuit are connected (via 

R6, R7, R8, R9, R10) to a measuring arrangement 
(M1, M2). 
Triggering circuit according to Patent Claim 10, 
characterized 


in that, for test purposes, the firing capacitors 
(C) can be connected in series in a high-impedance 

manner (via T4/R5).
