<ABSTRACT>
A controlled, multiple-wing passage door is used in particular person access locks. It has at least one main wing (4a, 4b) equipped with at least one folding wing (4c, 4d). The main wing (4a, 4b) is coupled so as to swivel, to the folding wing (4c, 4d), so that both wings move in different directions of rotation when they are actuated. The door (4a, 4b) formed by the main wing may be opened only into one (16) of the spaces (15, 16) which it separates, in particular outwardly. The rotation of the main wing and of the folding wing is synchronized to ensure that they reach their end positions when the folding wing is actively moved. This passage door has absolutely reliable function and operation. It may be built into any existing passages without problems and at no special cost. At the same time, it ensures a more rapid passage through the access lock.

<CLAIMS>
A controlled, multiple-wing passage door, particularly for
person access locks, having at least one main wing (4a; 4b)

equipped with at least one folding wing (4c; 4d) hinged to a
stationary swivel axis (6), said folding wing (4c; 4d) being

swivellingly hinged by means of a swivel axis (6') to said main
wing (4a; 4b) so that both wings when moved between the two end

positions, firmly overlying in the open state and hingedly
opened each with respect to the other in the closed state, move

in different synchronized directions of rotation, characterized
in that the coordinated swivelling movement is caused by manual

or motor driven commitment of forces either on the folding
wing (4c; 4d) or on the main wing (4a; 4b), by providing means

for establishing a kinematic connection between said folding
wing (4c; 4d), said main wing (4a; 4b) swivellingly hinged to

said folding wing (4c; 4d) and fixed points (20, 21; 43) on the
door posts.
Passage door according to claim 1, characterized in that

said kinematic connection is established by means of a chain
(23) and at least one chain-wheel (18; 36, 37, 38).
Passage door according to claim 2, characterized in that
said chain wheel (18) is mounted eccentrically with respect to

the swivelling axis (6') between said main wing (4a; 4b) and
said folding wing (4c; 4d) on said swivelling axis (6'). 
Passage door according to any of claims 2 or 3, characterized
in that the chain stringers (23, 24) parting from said

chain wheel (18) have their free ends fixed, e.g. to the door
frame.
Passage door according to any of claims 1-4, characterized
in that the passage door is a door with two wings (4a, 4b),

whereby their movements for swivelling the wings in opposite
directions are synchronized by means of connection elements,

e.g. a crossed chain, a push rod system (30, 31) or bars.
Passage door according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that opening or closing of the door in case of failure

in current supply is safeguarded by mechanical and/or hydraulical
means.
