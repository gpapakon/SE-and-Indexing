<ABSTRACT>
A telephone having a semiconductor line switch TR1 is protected from 
excess line voltage or current by the use of current foldback techniques. A 

current sensing resistor R12 in series with the line switch provides a measure of 
the line current and this operates a bypass transistor TR4 which reduces the 

drive current for the line switch TR1 causing it to come out of saturation and 
begin to block line current. A voltage sensing resistor R9 provides a measure of 

the voltage across TR1 and this further increases the bypass current through 
TR4. This ensures that the voltage and current applied to TR1 remain within 

permitted limits.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the protection of telephones from faults causing 
excessive current and power dissipation. When the handset of a telephone is lifted, a line switch inside the 
telephone closes and allows current from the exchange to flow through the 
telephone. Modern telephones, especially hands-free telephones, often use a 
semiconductor (such as a bipolar or field effect transistor) to provide the 
switching of the current. With normal exchange battery voltages and feed 
impedances, the semiconductor switch remains saturated when closed and very 
little power is dissipated in the switch. During abnormal conditions such as an 
exchange ring trip failure or earth fault, an excessive level of current may flow 
through the telephone and damage the components of the telephone. If a 
semiconductor switch is used, the overload can be detected and the 
semiconductor switch can be used to limit the current to a predetermined level. A problem with this arrangement is that the semiconductor line switch 
will come out of saturation and a significant voltage drop appears across the 
semiconductor line switch. Although the current has been limited to a safe 
level, the power dissipated by the line switch is the product of this current and 
the voltage drop across the line switch. The power level can easily exceed the 
rating of the semiconductor line switch and cause a failure of the semiconductor 
line switch. This specification describes a telephone subset having a first  
 
semiconductor line switch and a control circuit to control the operation of the 
line switch, the control circuit including current sensing means to sense the line 
current and voltage sensing means to provide a measure of the voltage across 
the line switch, the control means acting to ensure that the combination of the 
line current and the voltage across the line switch remains within a permitted 
range. The invention overcomes this situation by foldback current limiting. The 
circuit is arranged such that the current limit is not fixed, but is dependent on 
the voltage across the line switch. As the overload condition increases the 
voltage drop across the line switch increases but the current through the line 
switch will initially limit and then decrease. With this arrangement, not only is 
the current limited but the power dissipation is also limited. Correct selection of 
the values in the circuit ensure that the line switch remains within its published 
safe operating area. The component values selected to limit the
