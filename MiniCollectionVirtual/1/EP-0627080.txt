<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided to ascertain the total number of cells per unit volume of a cell specimen in an apparatus which does not measure the volume of a suspension containing the specimen as it is being analyzed. The method comprising mixing a suspension of a known quantity of particles having a first light scatter signal with a known volume of a cell specimen having a second light scatter signal different from the first signal to obtain a suspension having a concentration of particles per specimen volume, passing each of said particles and each cell in said cell specimen, in turn, through a light beam, each of said particles and cells producing at least one forward light scattering pattern, counting the number of cells and the number of particles in a portion of said suspension, and determining the total number of cells per unit volume of specimen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for accurately 
determining the count per unit volume of particles 
suspended in a fluid containing two or more different 
particles. More particularly, the invention relates to 
determining the blood cell count per unit specimen volume 
of blood cells in a flow cytometric system wherein the 
flow cytometer does not measure the volume of a suspension 
containing the specimen as it is being analyzed and 
wherein the blood cells of interest are CD4 lymphocytes. 
In addition, this invention relates to the use of added 
particles as a quality control check during analysis of 
the specimen. HTLV III or Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type III, now 
commonly referred to as Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
("HIV") is recognized to be the causative agent for human 
immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. The chronic nature of 
AIDS considered as approaching epidemic proportions in the 
United States and other countries is reflected by a 
surfeit of studies and efforts to develop diagnostic 
immunoassays for reliably and consistently detecting viral 
antigens and antibodies to such antigens in human 
peripheral blood. In substantial measure, monoclonal 
antibody technology has been recorded for developing such 
immunoassays. HIV belongs to the retrovirus group of viruses. 
Retroviruses carry a positive-stranded RNA and a special 
enzyme called reverse transcriptase in its core which is 
used to convert viral RNA into DNA. This reverses the 
classical process of cellular transcription in which DNA 
is converted to RNA.  
 It is known that the HIV binds to CD4 lymphocytes 
because the protein on the surface of CD4 lymphocytes 
serves as a receptor or binding site for HIV [Dalgleish AG 
et al., Nature 312:763-767 (1985)]. HIV also can bind to 
and attack other cells, such as, monocytes, tissue 
macrophages, and cells in the brain, spinal cord and 
peripheral nerves. The life cycle of HIV calls for the 
virus entering the host patient through sexual activity or 
blood transfusion, for instance, and then binding to 
receptors on monocytes and lymphocytes. The virus 
penetrates the cell and sheds its envelope or protein coat 
so as to expose its viral RNA core. The reverse 
transcriptase converts the viral RNA core to DNA which is 
integrated into the host cell genome. New viral particles 
are produced in quantity until the membrane of the host 
cell is ruptured to release the new viral particles in the 
human blood system. Diagnostic tests are commercially available at this 
time utilizing

A method to ascertain a total number of cells per 
volume of a cell specimen in an apparatus which does not 

measure the volume of a suspension containing the specimen 
as it is being analyzed, said method characterized by the 

steps of: 

a. mixing a known quantity of particles having a 
first light scatter signal with a known volume of a cell 

specimen having a second light scatter signal different 
from the first light scatter signal, to obtain a suspension 

having a concentration of particles per specimen volume; 
b. passing said particles and cells in an 
unknown volume portion of said cell suspension, in turn, 

through a light beam, said particles and cells 
producing at least one forward light-scattering signal; 
c. counting the number of cells and the number of 
particles in said unknown volume portion of said 

suspension by using a flow cytometer with a light scatter 
trigger; and 
d. determining the total number of cells per volume 
of the specimen by correlating the number of particles and 

cells in said portion of the suspension to the known 
quantity of particles added to said cell specimen using 

light scatter measurements and fluorescent measurements. 
A method to ascertain a total number of cells per 
volume of a cell specimen in an apparatus which does not 

measure volume of a suspension containing the specimen as 
it is being analyzed, said method characterized by the 

steps of:  
 


a. mixing a known quantity of particles with a 
known volume of a cell specimen to obtain a suspension 

having a concentration of particles per specimen volume, 
said particles remaining separate from the cells in said 

suspension, 
b. counting the number of cells and the number of 
particles in an unknown volume portion of said suspension 

by using a flow cytometer with a light scatter trigger, 
and 
c. determining the total number of cells per volume

said particles have a density less than 20% difference 

Than the cells in the cell specimen. 
The method of claims 1 or 2 which further includes 
maintaining operating parameters of a counting apparatus 

within specification during the determination of the total 
number of cells per volume of a cell specimen and wherein 

said particles have fluorescence at a known wavelength; 
further characterized by (e) correlating said light 

scattering signal and fluorescence signal of the particles 
to a predetermined ratio which represents a threshold of 

minimum apparatus performance; and (f) adjusting, if the 
predetermined ratio has not been attained, the operation 

of said apparatus, while the particles are within the  
 

incident beam of light, until the measured ratio reaches 
said predetermined ratio.

particles have been treated to prevent them from attaching 

to the cells in the cell specimen.
