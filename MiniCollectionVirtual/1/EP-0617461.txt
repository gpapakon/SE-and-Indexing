<ABSTRACT>
A method for making gate dielectrics (50) for MOS devices includes 
first forming a silicon oxynitride layer (70), and then forming a silicon dioxide layer 

(80) that underlies the oxynitride layer. The oxynitride layer functions as a 
membrane for controlled diffusion of oxygen to the oxidation region of the silicon 

substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for manufacturing MOS integrated 
circuits. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for forming gate 
dielectric layers that contain oxynitrides of silicon. There is increasing interest in MOS integrated circuits in which the 
component devices have gate dimensions as small as 0.25 µm or even less. Devices 
having such small dimensions suffer from certain problems that are not of serious 
concern when the gate dimensions are 1 µm or more. For example, the scaling rules 
that apply to these small devices call for very thin gate oxide layers, typically 
equivalent to 30 Å - 70 Å of silicon dioxide. Conventional gate oxide layers, which 
consist of thermally grown silicon dioxide, may be inadequate in several respects 
when they are made this thin. For example, such thin oxide layers tend to exhibit a high density of 
pinholes. These layers are also very permeable to boron. As a result, boron from a 
p+-doped polysilicon gate electrode can readily penetrate the thin oxide layer and 
contaminate the underlying channel during subsequent, high-temperature processing. Difficulties also arise in the fabrication of these thin silicon dioxide 
layers. That is, these layers are conventionally grown at temperatures greater than 
900°C, and typically 1000°C or more. The ability to control the thickness of these 
layers depends on the growth rate. In general, oxidation at these temperatures 
proceeds so quickly that it is difficult to assure that the resulting layer will have a 
uniform thickness. The oxidation rate can, of course, be decreased by reducing the 
temperature to, e.g., 900°C or less. However, the resulting films tend to have large 
compressive stress that enhances the accumulation of electric charge at the 
semiconductor interface, and may also enhance current leakage. It is known that silicon oxynitride films are less permeable to diffusing 
boron atoms than silicon dioxide films. Silicon oxynitride films have, in fact, been 
made for use as gate dielectrics. However, the interfaces between these films and the 
underlying semiconductor are generally of poor quality, as evidenced by low carrier 
mobilities in the resulting device channels. Moreover, these films must generally be 
made at a relatively high reaction temperature, resulting in poor control over film 
thickness, as discussed above.  
 To solve at least some of these problems, several investigators have 
proposed the use of composite dielectric films that include a layer of silicon dioxide 
as well
