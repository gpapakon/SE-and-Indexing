<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel cephalosporin
compound which is useful as an antibiotic agent. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a cephem compound having
(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol(or aminothiadiazol)-4-yl)-2-(α-carboxy-3,4-substituted
benzyloxyimino)acetamido group on 7β-position and, at
the same time, a 3-substituted propenyl group on C-3 position,
that is, a cephalosporin compound represented by the following
general formula (I), having an 4-amino-trisubstituted pyrimidinium
substituent on 3-position of propenyl group :
 
in which
R1, R2 and R3represent hydrogen,R4represents hydrogen,R5, R6 and R7independently represent hydrogen, amino, C1-4 alkyl, orR5 and R6together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached
can form a C3-7 cycle, andQrepresents CH or N,
and its pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt, physiologically
hydrolyzable ester, hydrate and solvate, and geometric, diastereomeric and tantomeric isomers thereof,
which have a potent antimicrobial activity and a broad antibacterial
spectrum.The present invention also relates to a process for preparation
of the compound of formula (I), as defined above, and to a
pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of formula (I)
as an active ingredient.Cephalosporin antibiotics have been widely used for treatment
of diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria in human and
animals and are particularly useful for treatment of diseases
caused by bacteria which are resistant to other antibiotics such 
as penicillin compounds and for treatment of penicillinhypersensitive
patients. In most bacterial infections, it is
preferable to use antibiotics which are active against both of
gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. In addition, it
has been well known that an antimicrobial activity of such cephalosporin
antibiotics is greately influenced by the substituent on
3- or 7-position of the cephem nucleus. Accordingly, it has
been attempted to develop an antibiotic compound which shows a
high antibacterial activity against a broad range of gram-positive
and gram-negative strains and is very stable to β-lactamase
produced by various gram-negative bacterial strains and is also
very stable in the living body. As a result, heretofore, numerous
cephalosporin antibiotics having various substituents on the
7β-acylamido group and the 3-position of cephem nucleus have been
developed.For example, British Patent No. 1,399,086 broadly and generally
describes a cephalosporin derivative represented by the
following general formula (A):
