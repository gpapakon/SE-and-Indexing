<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of recycling waste oil 
fluids including dispersed solids and emulsified water and 

of removing emulsified oil from an industrial wastewater 
stream. According to the method, the waste oil and the 

oil-containing water, respectively, is treated with an 
effective amount of a dispersion of a water-soluble 

cationic polymer, 
prepared by polymerizing a water-soluble monomer mixture containing at 

least 5% mole of a cationic monomer represented by (I) and at least 5% 
mole of acrylamide or methacrylamide in an aqueous solution of a 

polyvalent anionic salt, said polymerization is carried out in the 
presence of a dispersant polymer, soluble in said aqueous solution of 

the salt and containing at least 20% mole of monomer units represented 
by (II) 


wherein:
 

R₁, R₄ are H or CH₃
 

R₂, R₃, R₅, R₆ are alkyl group of 1 to 2 carbon 

atoms
 

R₇ is H or alkyl group of 1 to 2 carbon atoms
 

A₁, A₂ are -O- or -NH-
 

B₁, B₂ are alkyl group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms or hydroxypropyl 
group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a method for recovering oil
from waste oil fluids;
and more particularly, the
invention is directed to a method of recovering oil from
waste oil fluids
using water-soluble polymers
dispersed in a concentrated salt media.The recovery and recycling of oil from waste oil is becoming more
important due to economics and stricter environmental EPA regulations regarding
the disposal of waste oil. Generally, waste oils include dispersed solids and
emulsified water. The solids and water should be removed if the oil is to be
recycled. Untreated waste oils are considered hazardous and usually cannot be
landfilled. Stricter regulations are driving customers to recycle more and to invest
in the treatment of waste oils.Table 1 classifies waste oils in the following industrial categories:
Refinery waste oil comes from two different sources: (1) Skimmings from
the water clarification equipment, i.e., DAFs, APIs, and consisting mainly of crude
oil; and, (2) Leakage from processes collected via traps and drains throughout the
plant. This oil is usually sent to a wastewater treatment plant (WWPT).One type of waste oil is waste oil formed during the process of removing
dispersed oil from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants. The oil (called
"float" or "skimmings") is concentrated in clarification vessels such as dissolved air
floatation units (DAFs), induced gas floatation units (IGFs), corrugated plate
interceptors (CPIs), and holding tanks. The oil floats to the top of these units, is
removed by mechanical means and then stored. This waste oil may then be
disposed of by incineration, sent to oil reclamation sites, or treated on-site.
These
waste oils have a minimum of 50% to 95% oil and contain emulsified water and
solids which are stabilized by chemicals used to remove the oil from the waste
water.Several other examples of waste oil include waste oil from: oil production,
oil refineries, aluminum and steel mills, laundries, automotive and chemical
processing industries. One large source of waste oil is used motor oils.One of the most effective methods of removing the solids and water in
waste oil fluids is through the use of the chemical demulsifying aids. Typically,
this application requires 10 to 100 times the dosage needed for other emulsion
breaking applications, such as removing water from crude oil. Historically, dry polymers, solution polymers, inverse emulsion latexes and
metal ions have been used to assist in the treatment of waste oil. Each material
has its own advantages and
