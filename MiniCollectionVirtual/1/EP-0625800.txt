<ABSTRACT>
In charge coupled imaging devices, a major portion of the photosensitive 
surface area is covered by electrodes with which the charge storage and the charge 

transport in the semiconductor body are controlled. These electrodes are preferably 
made of polycrystalline silicon. This material, however, like other conductive materials 

known 
per se
, has a comparatively high absorption coefficient, in particular in the 
short-wave portion of the visible spectrum (blue), which adversely affects the 

sensitivity. According to the invention, the electrodes are manufactured partly from a 
very thin poly layer, preferably not thicker than 50 nm, and partly from a less 

transparent but well conducting layer, for example, poly of much greater thickness. The 
electrodes are so provided that the major portion of the surface area is covered by the 

thin, transparent layer and only a comparatively small portion by the less transparent, 
thick poly layer, parts of the latter being in addition used for the electrical connection of 

the electrodes made from the very thin poly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a charge coupled imaging device with a
semiconductor body in which a charge transport channel is defined at or adjacent a
surface for the storage and transport of electric charge, which surface is provided with a
series of gate electrodes in the form of conductive layers which are electrically insulated
from the surface by an interposed gate dielectric, the device being designed for
receiving electromagnetic radiation which is captured at least partly in or adjacent the
charge transport channel through the gate electrodes and through the surface and is
converted into electric charge through absorption.The device may be a one-dimensional sensor or a line sensor. In the most
widely used embodiment, the device forms a two-dimensional imaging device. A known
type of two-dimensional imaging device which is used both in professional cameras and
in consumer cameras is the frame transfer sensor, often called FT sensor for short, in
which an image captured in the imaging section during a certain integration time is
quickly transported into a memory section after the integration time in order to be read
out there line by line. In the present document, the invention will be described in
particular with reference to an FT sensor. It should be borne in mind, however, that the
invention is not limited to imaging devices of the FT type, but may also be
advantageously applied to other types of sensors such as line sensors or two-dimensional
sensors in which the imaging section at the same time performs the function of a
memory section, i.e. which do not comprise a separate memory section. In general, the
invention is applicable to all types of CCD imaging devices in which the conversion of
radiation into electric charge takes place in or at least in the immediate vicinity of the
charge transport channel.Since the charge transport layer in this type of imaging device at the same
time forms the photosensitive elements in which the conversion from electromagnetic
radiation to electric charge takes place, the radiation must penetrate the subjacent
semiconductor body through the gate electrodes, at least in the usual case of
illumination through the upper side. This always leads to a loss in sensitivity owing to 
absorption. The absorption is not the same for all wavelengths in the visible range of
the spectrum, but comparatively great for blue and comparatively small for red when
the gate electrodes, as is usual, are made of silicon, often in polycrystalline form, which
is usually referred to as
