<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating an optical 
semiconductor device includes the steps of forming at 

least two stripes of dielectric parallel to each other 
with a predetermined interval on a semiconductor 

substrate, growing a crystal selectively between the 
two stripes, and forming a multi-layer structure 

which is required to have a width determined by the 
crystal grown between the two stripes. In such a 

method, the width of the multi-layer structure 
including an active layer or a waveguide is 

controlled precisely, because there is no step of 
etching a semiconductor layer, so that the 

characteristics of the device may improve and the 
yield may increase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
fabricating an optical semiconductor device, and more 
particularly, to a method for fabricating an optical 
semiconductor device such as a single semiconductor 
laser, a combination of a semiconductor laser and a 
semiconductor optical modulator or a waveguide 
integrated in a common semiconductor substrate used 
in an optical communication system, an optical 
information processing system, etc. An optical semiconductor device such as a 
semiconductor laser used in an optical communication 
system or an optical information processing system 
has been required to have higher performances as well 
as to be fabricated at low cost for public use, so 
that it is necessary to fabricate such an optical 
semiconductor device from a large size semiconductor 
wafer with high yield. In order to meet these requirements, 
the optical semiconductor device is fabricated by a 
process in which crystal growth is carried out by 
vapor phase epitaxy such as metalorganic vapor phase 
epitaxy (MOVPE) by which epitaxial growth is realized  
 
in a large area with high uniformity. Such a vapor 
phase epitaxy allows to fabricate a semiconductor 
laser of quantum well structure having 
characteristics such as low threshold and high 
efficiency operation or narrow spectrum operation. In a first conventional method for fabricating 
an optical semiconductor device, a double-hetero (DH) 
structure consisting of an n-InP clad layer, an 
InGaAsP active layer and a p-InP clad layer is formed 
on an n-InP substrate. Then, an SiO2 layer is 
formed on the p-InP clad layer, and patterned to 
stripes each of which having a width of 2 µm. 
Then, the DH structure is mesa-etched, except for the area 
which is masked by the SiO2 layer, until the surface 
of the n-InP substrate is exposed. The width of the 
remaining active layer thus subjected to mesa-etching 
becomes 1.5 µm, which enables the 
fundamental transverse mode to be kept stable. 
Then, p-InP and n-InP buried layers are deposited in 
this order on the exposed surface of the n-InP 
substrate to stuff the grooves formed by the mesa-etching 
on both sides of the remaining double-hetero 
structure. Finally, after removing the SiO2 layer, 
a p-InP layer and a p+-InGaAs cap layer are 
deposited in this order to cover the fabricated 
surface of the n-InP substrate. In a second conventional method for  
 
fabricating an optical semiconductor device, a DH 
structure consisting of a first clad layer, an active 
layer and a second clad layer is formed
