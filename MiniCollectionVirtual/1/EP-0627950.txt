<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for reclaiming water which has been previously used for such purposes as washing vehicles and includes both a diatomaceous earth filter (10) for removing particulates and a carbon filter (36) for removing organic contaminate. Reclaimed water which is in the system and not immediately required for use is continuously recycled by a pump (34) so as to enhance the removal of contaminants. A second pump (50) moves the cleaned water into a pressure tank (52) for use in washing. A substantial portion of the system is disposed below ground level with a lockable cover (76) above.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to car wash 
water reclamation and, in particular, to an improved 
filtration system. Water reclamation systems are commonly employed 
at vehicle washing operations not only to reduce cost, 
but also to conserve water which is in short supply at 
certain places or times. Such systems conventionally 
use sand filters, sometimes in conjunction with 
charcoal or carbon filters. Similar water reclamation 
systems may be used in full-service car wash 
operations, laundromats and for reclaiming certain 
residential water. U.S. Patent No. 3,550,778, Kesselman, entitled 
"Waste Water Reclamation System," discloses the use of 
a sand and gravel filter in conjunction with a pair of 
carbon filters. U.S. Patent No. 3,923,658, Lancaster, entitled 
"Vehicle Washing Plant," discloses the use of backwash 
filters in conjunction with activated charcoal 
filters. U.S. Patent No. 4,168,231, Allen, et al., 
entitled "Method and Apparatus for Recycling Water in 
a Car Wash," discloses a system which primarily relies 
upon a centrifugal separator for removal of solid 
particles. No provision is made for removing soap. U.S. Patent No. 4,652,368, Ennis, et al., 
entitled "Water Filtration System," discloses a system 
employing a series of strainers, centrifugal 
separators and a charcoal filter. No provision is 
made for removing soap.  
 The present system removes not only solid 
particles, but also dissolved oil, grease and 
surfactants so that the resulting water can be used 
not only for washing but also in rinsing. Reclaimed 
water also may be reused in laundromats and for 
irrigation. Waste water which has been collected after being 
used in car washing and passed through sand and grease 
traps, is held in settling tanks and is then first 
passed through a diatomaceous earth filter which 
removes particles of dirt, oil and rust. It is next 
pumped through a filter containing activated charcoal 
which will remove dissolved organic materials such as 
oil and surfactants. The reclaimed water is sent to a clean water tank 
and is recirculated through the filters until required 
and it is drawn off for use. Provision is also made 
for backwashing the filters as needed to maintain the 
effectiveness of the filters. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to 
provide a water reclamation system which will remove 
the surfactants in water along with the dirt held by 
the surfactants. It is also an object of this invention to provide 
a water reclamation system which is compact. In

<CLAIMS>
A water reclamation system for continuously 
treating waste water which has been previously used 

and then pretreated by being passed through a sand 
filter and a degreasing trap comprising:
 
   a diatomaceous earth filter (10) having an 

inlet and an outlet;
 
   means for delivering the waste water to said 

diatomaceous earth filter (10) inlet;
 
an activated carbon filter (36) having an inlet and an 

outlet;
 
   a first pump (34) connected to receive water 

from said diatomaceous earth filter (10) outlet and to 
deliver water to said carbon filter (36) inlet;
 
   a clean water tank (48) having an inlet and 

an outlet and an overflow (58);
 
   said inlet of said clean water tank (48) 

connected to said outlet of said activated carbon filter (36);
 
   a pressure tank (52) having an inlet and an 

outlet;
 
   a second pump (50) connected to receive 

clean water from said clean water tank (48) outlet and 
to deliver clean water to said pressure tank (52) 

inlet for storage at an elevated pressure; and
 
   means for continuously recirculating a 

portion of clean water entering said clean water tank 
(48) which exits through said overflow (58) back to 

said diatomaceous earth filter (10) for recycling 
through said diatomaceous earth filter (10) and said 

activated carbon filter (36) for enhanced purification. 
A water reclamation system in accordance 
with claim 1 further including:
 
   a water line (26) connected to supply makeup 

water to said diatomaceous earth filter (10).  
 
A water reclamation system in accordance 
with claim 1 further including:
 
   a pressure switch (54) connected to measure 

pressure in said pressure tank (52) and to start said 
second pump (50) when pressure is below a desired 

level. 
A water reclamation system in accordance 
with claim 1 further including:
 
   a diatomaceous earth crock (12) containing a 

diatomaceous earth slurry;
 
   a third pump (14) to pump said diatomaceous 

earth slurry from said diatomaceous earth crock (12) 
to said diatomaceous earth filter (10). 
A water reclamation system in accordance 
with claim 1 wherein:
 
   a major portion of said water reclamation 

system is disposed in a pit having a lockable cover

A water reclamation system in accordance 
with claim 1 further including:
 
   means for backwashing said diatomaceous

pressure at said activated carbon filter (36).  
 
A method of reclaiming waste water which has 
been previously used and pretreated by being passed through a sand filter 

and a degreasing trap comprising the steps of:
 
   continuously passing the water through a 

diatomaceous earth filter (10) to remove particulates 
therefrom;
 
   passing the water exiting the diatomaceous filter through an

   storing said clean water in a clean water 

tank (48) ready for re-use; and
 
   continuously recirculating a portion 

of said clean water taken from said clean water tank 
(48) through said diatomaceous earth and a
ctivated carbon
