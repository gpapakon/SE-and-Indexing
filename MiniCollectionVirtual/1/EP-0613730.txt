<ABSTRACT>
A sorting device with a transport device (5) for displacing objects such as, 
for example, postal items (99) from an input station (1) to an output position (3a, 3b) 

selected from among a plurality of output positions (3). The transport device (5) 
comprises a field (101) of individual transport units (23, 105) arranged in a hexagonal 

grid shape and each provided with a transport mechanism (27) arranged on a rotatable 
support (25). The output positions (3) are positioned alongside the field (101), while the 

field (101) is accessible through at least two separate input positions (9, 11, 109, 119). 
Alternative routes can be selected by means of an electronic control unit (15) and 

microprocessors (127) in the field (101) between an input position (9, 11, 109, 119) and 
a selected output position (3) by joining together the individual transport units (23, 

105). 
The use of at least two separate input positions (9, 11, 109, 119) and of 
the grid-shaped field (101) renders it possible to move several postal items 

simultaneously and in parallel through the field (101), so that the sorting device has a 
great handling capacity. 
The sorting device is suitable for sorting of postal items which are 
provided with address codes corresponding to destinations of the items. During sorting 

of comparatively light postal items such as letters, a great capacity is provided, while a 
satisfactory capacity is provided during sorting of comparatively heavy postal items 

which are moved at comparatively low speeds through the sorting device, for example, 
postal parcels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sorting device with an input position, a plurality 
of output positions, and a transport device for the selective displacement of an object 
from the input position to one of the output positions. The invention also relates to a transport unit suitable for use in a sorting 
device according to the invention. A sorting device of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is known 
from the brochure "Indexing and Sorting of Letter-Mail" issued in November 1985 by 
Nederlandse Philips Bedrijven B.V., Industrial & Electro-Acoustic Systems, Advanced 
Automation Systems. The known sorting device, which has the type number PS 1010, is 
used for automatic sorting of postal items such as letters and comparatively thin postal 
parcels which carry an address code. The postal items are transported from the input 
position to an automatic address code reader and are subsequently transported to a 
selected output position in sequential manner by the transport device, which device 
comprises an assembly of rollers, conveyor belts and transport ropes, and which forms 
a single route. The output positions are arranged along a number of side branches of the 
transport device and are selectively accessible through the use of adjustable switching 
flaps. The known sorting device is provided with an electronic control unit which 
controls the switching flaps on the basis of data provided by the address code reader. A disadvantage of the known sorting device is that the sorting device has 
a limited transport capacity owing to the sequential transport of the postal items. 
Comparatively heavy postal items, which are moved through the transport device at a 
comparatively low speed, can accordingly only be sorted with a comparatively low 
capacity.  It is an object of the invention to provide a sorting device of the kind 
mentioned in the opening paragraph which has a higher transport capacity, so that 
comparatively heavy postal items can also be sorted with a satisfactory capacity. The invention is for this purpose characterized in that the transport device 
comprises a field of separate transport units, a separate input position being assigned to 
at least two transport units, while the transport units each have a transport direction 
which is adjustable relative to a system of coordinates which is in a fixed position 
relative to the field, alternative through routes being selectable in the field between an 
input position and a selected output position through mutual orientation of the

<CLAIMS>
A sorting device with an input position, a plurality of output positions, 
and a transport device for the selective displacement of an object from the input position 

to one of the output positions, characterized in that the transport device comprises a 
field of separate transport units, a separate input position being assigned to at least two 

transport units, while the transport units each have a transport direction which is 
adjustable relative to a system of coordinates which is in a fixed position relative to the 

field, alternative through routes being selectable in the field between an input position 
and a selected output position through mutual orientation of the transport directions of 

the individual transport units. 
A sorting device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the separate 
transport units are arranged in parallel tracks, the object being displaceable in a track 

through mutual orientation of the transport directions of the transport units of the 
relevant track, while the object is displaceable from one of two adjoining tracks to the 

other track through mutual orientation of the transport directions of the transport units 
of these adjoining tracks. 
A sorting device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that at least two 
input positions are present at each of the two ends of the parallel tracks. 
A sorting device as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the 
output positions are arranged along an exterior track. 
A sorting device as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the transport units are each provided with a transport mechanism 

which is arranged on a support and which determines the transport direction of the 
transport unit relative to a system of coordinates which is fixed relative to the support, 

while the supports of the individual transport units extend in a common plane which is 
parallel to the system of coordinates which is fixed relative to the field, and the supports 

are each rotatable about an axis of rotation which extends perpendicular to the common 
plane, the mutual orientation of the transport directions of two adjoining transport units 

being achieved by a suitable rotation of the relevant supports about their axes of 
 

rotation. 
A sorting device as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the supports 
are disc-shaped and the field of transport units has a hexagonal grid shape, while the 

support of at least one central transport unit is hexagonally surrounded by the supports 
of six adjoining transport units.

of a transport unit has a preferred position in which the transport direction of the 

transport unit runs parallel to a track of the field, while the support has two subsidiary 
positions in which the support is rotated through a positive angle of 60° and through a 

negative angle of 60°, respectively, relative to the preferred position. 
A sorting device as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that the support 
is provided near a circumference with a first and a second identification mark, which 

marks are present on two radians of the axis of rotation of the support which enclose an 
angle of 60° with one another, while a first and a second detector are arranged around 

the support on two radians of the axis of rotation of the support which enclose a 
positive and a negative angle of 30°, respectively, with a main radial of the axis of 

rotation directed parallel to the track, which detectors are in a fixed position relative to

position. 
A sorting device as claimed in any one of the Claims 5 to 9, characterized

the transport direction of the transport unit, each belt being guided around two rollers 
which are displaceable transverse to the transport direction against a reset force and 

 
which have axes of rotation extending perpendicular to the support, whereby the object 

is displaceable in the transport direction by means of a clamping action between the two 
conveyor belts caused by the reset force.
