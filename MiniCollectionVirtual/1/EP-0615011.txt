<ABSTRACT>
A spindle for producing a yarn or twist, with a spindle rotor (1) which has for a thread (F) a thread-guide channel (2) commencing essentially in the region of the spindle axis and directed radially outwards. After coming out of the thread-guide channel (2), the thread is guided further, thereby forming a balloon, to a centring point (Z) located in the extension of the spindle-rotor axis (A). To introduce a flowable medium (M1), multi-phase if appropriate, into the space surrounded by the thread balloon (F), there is at least one feed conduit (3) directed essentially radially to the space surrounded by the thread balloon (F). The device for feeding the flowable medium can be arranged both on two-for-one twisting spindles and on direct-cabling spindles.

<CLAIMS>
Spindle for manufacturing a yarn or thread with a spindle 
rotor (1, 11, 21, 31) which has a thread-guiding channel 

(2, 12, 22, 32), essentially beginning in the region of 
the spindle shaft (4) and being directed radially 

outwards, for a thread (F, Fl, F5, F7) which, after 
emerging from the thread-guiding channel, is guided in the 

form of a balloon on to a centring point lying in the 
extension of the spindle rotor shaft, characterized by at 

least one supply pipe (3, 13, 23, 33, 43) - directed 
substantially radially towards the space defined by 

the balloon of thread - for the introduction of a flowable 
medium (M1 to M9) into this space defined by the balloon 

of thread. 
Spindle according to Claim 1, characterized in that it is 
designed as a twisting spindle and has a balloon limiter 

(5, 35) which for each supply pipe (3, 3.1, 3.2, 33) has 
a radial opening (5.1, 5.'1, 5.''l) to which this supply 

pipe is connected. 
Spindle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
it is designed as a two-for-one twisting spindle and has 

a hollow shaft leading at its lower end to the thread-guiding 
channel (2, 22), the threads (F1, F2, F3, F4) 

to be twisted being fed into the upper end (4, 24) of 
this hollow shaft. 
Spindle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
it is designed as a direct cabling spindle and has a hollow 

shaft for a thread component (F'1, F7), this hollow shaft 
leading axially through the shaft extension (11.1, 31.1) 

of the spindle rotor (11, 31) to the thread-guiding 
channel (12, 32), and the thread component (F'1, F7) being 

guided into the region of the centring point (Z', Z) together 
with a second thread component (F'2, F6), for the 

manufacture of a cabled yarn structure, which is supplied 
substantially axially in direction of the centring point 

(Z', Z) from the space surrounded by the balloon of thread.  
 
Spindle according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that 
it has a thread-guiding pipe (15, 25) which on the one 

hand is fixed to the spindle rotor (11, 21) and rotates 
together with this and on the other hand leads to the 

centring point (Z), the thread (F'1, F5) emerging radially 
from the thread-guiding channel (12, 22) being conveyed 

through this thread-guiding pipe (15, 25) to the centring 
point (Z', Z). 
Spindle according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that it has a bobbin carrier with protective pot (6, 

16, 26, 36, 46), and the casing of the protective pot has 
an inlet opening (6.1, 16.1, 26.1, 36.1, 46.1) in the 

region opposite the outlet opening of each supply pipe 
(3, 13, 23, 33, 43). 
Spindle according to Claim 6, characterized in that each 
inlet opening (6.1, 16.1, 26.1, 36.1, 46.1) has a 

diameter which is greater by a given amount than the 
outlet opening of a supply pipe (3, 13, 23, 33, 43) 

respectively lying opposite it. 
Spindle according to Claim 7, characterized in that each 
inlet opening (6.1, 16.1, 26.1, 36.1, 46.1) is tapered 

inwards in the form of a funnel. 
Spindle according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that it has two supply pipes (9, 10) preferably 

directed diametrically into the space surrounded by the 
balloon of thread. 
Spindle according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that each supply pipe is brought to the space defined 

by the balloon of thread by way of two branch pipes (3.1, 
3.2; 13.1, 13.2) which lie at a distance from one another 

in direction of rotation, the two branch pipes each 
in turn being suitably controlled, opened or closed 

depending on the rotational speed of the spindle rotor.
