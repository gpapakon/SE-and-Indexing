<ABSTRACT>
Seat with modular construction for motor vehicles consisting of a support module (12, 13) a raiseable shell (21) for a seat cushion (20) integral with the said support module, a backrest (23) articulated to the said shell (21), at least one raiseable armrest module (27) and a seat belt anchoring point (28), characterised in that the armrest (27) and the seat belt anchoring point (28) are integral with the articulation spindle (24) of the backrest (23) and that the latter has a first cylindrical bearing surface (231) which extends transversely from the flank of the backrest towards a flange (30) by which the said backrest is mounted on the shell (21) of the seat cushion (20) and overhangs a second complementary peripheral cylindrical bearing surface (221) which extends transversely from the flank of the seat towards the said mounting flange (30) for the purpose of allowing the armrest (27) to rotate substantially along a lateral flank which is common to the backrest and to the cushion of the seat part.
