<ABSTRACT>
A surgical instrument 1 for performing 
procedures such as carpal tunnel release. The instrument 

consists of an elongated member 12 having a spring or cam 
plate positioned therein. The spring or cam plate 24 is 

movable from a retracted position within the elongated 
member to an extended position protruding through an 

aperture 18 in the elongated member. Movement of the 
spring or cam plate to the extended position stretches a 

flexible membrane 16 positioned over at least a portion of 
the elongated member to stretch the carpal tunnel 

ligament.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical
instruments for expanding body tissue, and more
particularly to an instrument for expanding ligaments such
as the carpal ligament in the hand during surgical
procedures such as carpal tunnel release.Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition of the
hand which typically results in loss of feeling, weakness
or numbness (paresthesia) in the fingers and hand. In
general, repetitive, short stroke motion of the fingers
and hand may lead to irritation of the median nerve which
passes through the carpal tunnel, and this irritation or
inflammation may lead to pain, weakness of the muscles and
general numbness in the fingers and hand. The carpal
tunnel is an area in the hand adjacent the wrist which is
bounded by the carpal bones of the hand and the transverse
carpal ligament. The median nerve and flexor tendons pass
through the tunnel to control movement of the fingers. As
the median nerve becomes irritated, or as the transverse
carpal ligament is thickened due to repetitive motions of
the hand and wrist, compression of the nerve inside the
carpal tunnel leads to carpal tunnel syndrome and its
associated degenerative conditions.In order to treat carpal tunnel syndrome, it has
been known to cut or divide the transverse carpal
ligament, also known as the flexor retinaculum, to provide
for decompression of the carpal tunnel. Historically, the 
division of the transverse carpal ligament was done during
open surgical procedures which involved slitting the palm
of the hand to expose the ligament prior to cutting the
ligament. Recently, instrumentation has been developed to
allow this procedure to be performed endoscopically, with
a small incision at the base of the wrist to allow for
division of the ligament beneath the skin. Once the
ligament is cut, it allows for additional space in the
carpal tunnel area to relieve the irritation and pressure
on the median nerve.Several instruments are known for performing
endoscopic decompression by division of the transverse
carpal ligament. An instrument known as the Paine
retinaculotome, as described in the Journal of
Neurosurgery, Vol. 59, December 1983, pp. 1031-1036,
provides a cutting edge which is engagable with the
transverse carpal ligament on the wrist side of the
ligament. The Paine instrument is inserted into the hand
through an incision at the base of the wrist. As the
ligament is engaged by the cutting instrument, the
instrument is advanced forward into the hand to divide the
ligament. A similar instrument is disclosed in U.S.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) for expanding the carpal
tunnel ligament during carpal tunnel surgery comprising:


a) an elongate body portion (12) having
formed therein at least one elongate aperture (18, 68, 76,

106, 215, 251, 368) extending between side walls around a
minor part of the full circumference of the elongate body

portion;
b) an expansion member (24, 44, 61, 82, 116,
140, 219, 262) positioned within said body portion and movable

between a first position substantially contained within said
body portion and a second position protruding through said

aperture between the side walls to contact and stretch body

tissue;
and
c) means (14)for controllably moving said
expansion member between said first and second positions.
An apparatus of claim 1, wherein said
expansion member comprises a spring (61).
An apparatus of claim 1, wherein said
expansion member comprises a substantially rigid member (24).
An apparatus of claim 3, further
comprising camming means for moving said substantially rigid

member (24), said camming means comprising a cam slot (27) formed
in said substantially rigid member.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding
claims wherein the means (14) for moving moves said expansion member

in a first direction towards said second position, the 
apparatus including means (30) for preventing movement of said

expansion member in a direction opposite to said first
direction.
An apparatus of any one of the preceding
claims wherein said elongate body portion is substantially

circular in cross section and has a plane including a
longitudinal axis of the apparatus which divides said body

portion into said first and a second section, said expansion
member moving only in a radial direction transverse to said

plane.
An apparatus of any of the preceding
claims wherein the moving means comprises a plunger (14)

longitudinally movable in said body portion.
An apparatus of claim 7, wherein said
plunger (14) comprises a rod member disposed within the elongate

body portion and engageable with the expansion member, the rod
member axially movable within the elongate body portion (12)

between a first and a second position, wherein movement of the
rod member to the first position causes movement of the

expansion member through the aperture of the elongate body
portion.
An apparatus of any of the preceding
claims wherein the moving means comprises a stationary grip

portion (8, 10, 203) and a pivotable handle, wherein movement of said
pivotable handle moves said expansion member between said

first and second positions.
An apparatus of any one of the
preceding claims , further comprising a flexible membrane

(16) positioned over at least a position of said elongate body
portion (12) and expandable upon movement of said expansion member

to said protruding position. 
An apparatus of claim 10, wherein the
expansion member is mounted in the elongate body portion for

movement between a first position substantially retracted in
the elongate member and a second position wherein at least a

portion of the expansion member extends through a side wall of
the elongate body portion to expand the membrane (16) in a

direction substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis.
