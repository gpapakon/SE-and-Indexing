<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to resist 
materials sensitive to radiations such as laser light, 
UV light, far UV light, X-ray, electron beam and the 
like which can be used for the fine processing of 
semiconductor devices, optical discs, magnetic bubble 
devices, magnetic heads, liquid crystal devices and the 
like, and to a pattern forming method using said resist 
materials. As prior art resist material for production of 
solid-state semiconductor devices, the positive resist 
mentioned in JP-A-4-174438 which is composed of a 
phenolic resin and diazonaphthoquinone, the negative 
resist mentioned in JP-A-59-222833 which is composed of 
a phenolic resin and azides, etc. are known. From said 
positive resist, a pattern is formed by irradiating it 
with UV light to convert the diazonaphthoquinone 
functioning as a dissolution inhibitor of the phenolic 
resin to an alkaline soluble indenecarboxylic acid, 
followed by dissolution of the UV-irradiated regions in 
an aqueous alkaline solution. On the other hand, from 
said negative resist, a pattern is formed by irradiating 
it to induce a crosslinking reaction between the azide 
and the phenolic resin and thereby to insolubilize the  
 
UV-irradiated regions, followed by dissolution of the 
non-irradiated regions in an aqueous alkaline solution. As understandable from the above-mentioned two 
resists, conventional resists require that the material 
constituting a resist simultaneously has an excellent 
radiation sensitivity and an excellent solubility 
inhibition or promotion ability, and materials excellent 
only in radiation sensitivity or solubility inhibition 
or promotion ability are not usable for this purpose. 
Due to this restriction, it has been quite difficult to 
realize a resist having a high sensitivity and a high 
resolution simultaneously from conventional resist 
materials. As a method for improving the characteristic 
properties of conventional resists, the method mentioned 
in JP-A-4-174438 can be referred to, for example. 
According to this method, the difference in dissolution 
rate between radiation-irradiated regions and non-irradiated 
regions is increased by adding alkali-soluble 
low molecular weight phenolic compounds to a positive 
photoresist and thereby enhancing the dissolution rate 
of radiation-irradiated regions. This method, however, 
has a problem in that addition of an alkali-soluble 
compound to a resist causes an increase in dissolution 
rate not only radiation-irradiated regions but also in 
non-irradiated regions
