<ABSTRACT>
Functional control (8) and action (1, 2, 3) units communicate with each other over a network (4a). At the outset, the units are allocated sub-network and unit addresses. The sub-network addresses make it possible to define, in software terms, several independent sub-networks. In order to avoid disturbing the adjacent installations, a filter (41) is provided at the input of the individually private part (4a) of the network (4). If it is not wished to subdivide into sub-networks downstream of the filter (41), the sub-network addresses become superfluous. In order for the installer to avoid the corresponding addressing steps, an isolation-declaration device (44) is added to the filter (41), on the individually private side, and in the same housing (42), which device (44) informs the functional units that the sub-network is protected and that consequently it is sufficient to adopt any predetermined sub-network address, which the device (44) indicates. Use to make the addressing operations simpler and more reliable.

Method for carrying out sub-network addressing
in an installation of functional units (1, 2, 3, 8)

communicating with each other via a wire network (4),
these functional units being designed to be allocated a

sub-network address making it possible to define, in
the network, sub-networks linking together functional

units which are capable, depending on the sub-network
addresses, of ignoring communications originating from

functional units attached to other sub-networks, characterised
in that a part of the network (4a) is isolated

in such a way as to prevent communications passing
between this part of the network (4a) and any other

part (4b, 4c, 4d) of the network (4), in that, in the
part network (4a), an isolation declaration message is

caused to be sent, and in that the functional units (1,
2, 3, 8) linked to the part network take account of

this message so as to adopt a predetermined sub-network
addressing.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the declaration message is caused to be sent by an

isolation declaration device (44) which sends out a
first message as soon as it is connected to the part

network (4a).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that when applying power the functional units automatically

initiate an addressing procedure at least if
their pre-existing addressing proves to be inoperative,

and in that, upon applying power to the part network,
an addressing interrupt message is caused to be sent. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the isolation declaration message

is caused to be sent cyclically.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the isolation declaration message is

caused to be sent upon interrogation from the functional
units (8).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the functional units (1, 2, 3, 8),

when they receive the isolation declaration message,
replace a pre-existing sub-network address with the

predetermined sub-network addressing.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the sub-network addresses attached to

the message flowing in the isolated part network are
monitored, and a further address allocation is caused

for the functional units the sub-network addressing of
which differs from the predetermined addressing.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a sub-network addressing

is allocated to a functional unit (1, 2, 3, 8) according
to the following stages:


waiting (51), by the functional unit, for an
isolation declaration message originating from the network;
if the functional unit is linked to a part
network (4a) which is physically isolated from the rest

(4b, 4c, 4d) of the network (4) in regard to communications
between functional units, sending an isolation

declaration message across the part network;
in the absence of an isolation declaration
message, determination (34, 36, 37, 38) of the sub-network 

address to be allocated to the functional unit,
so that this address is consistent with that of the

said other functional units;
in the presence of an isolation declaration
message, adoption (52) by the functional unit of a predetermined

sub-network addressing.
Method according to Claim 8, characterised in
that, before the waiting stage (51), the functional

unit carries out a stage of verification of an address
which has previously been allocated to it, enters the

waiting stage (51) if the previously allocated address
appears to be invalid, and closes the addressing procedure

if the previously allocated address appears to be
valid.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised
in that the isolation declaration message

prescribes the predetermined sub-network addressing.
Installation for implementing the method according
to one of Claims 1 to 10, comprising functional

units (1, 2, 3, 8) capable of communicating with each
other via a wire network (4) and of being organised

into sub-networks by means of a sub-network address allocated
to each functional unit, characterised in 
that
the installation comprises an isolation declaration device

(44) linked to the network and programmed to deliver
to the functional units, via the network, an isolation

declaration message according to which these
functional units belong to a sub-network (4a) which is

physically isolated from the rest (4b, 4c, 4b) of the
network (4) and in that the functional units are programmed

(52, 54) to take account of this message by 
systematically adopting a predetermined sub-network address.
Installation according to Claim 11, characterised
in that the isolation declaration device (44) is

programmed to send the message (46) spontaneously, and
the functional units already having a sub-network address

are programmed to replace (54) it with the predetermined
sub-network address when they receive the message.
Installation according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised
in that it further comprises, for implementing

the physical isolation between the sub-network in
question and the rest of the network, a filter (41) intended

to be placed at a junction between the sub-network
in question (4a) and the rest (4b, 4c, 4b) of

the network, and which prevents communication between
the sub-network (4a) and the rest (4b, 4c, 4b) of the

network.
Installation according to Claim 13, characterised
in that the filter (41) and the isolation declaration

device (44) are arranged in a single unit (42),
the isolation declaration device (44) being fitted

functionally on the sub-network (48) side with respect
to the filter.
Installation according to one of Claims 11 to
14, characterised in that the functional units are programmed,

at least in certain cases, to initiate an
automatic sub-network address allocation process at the

moment when power is applied, and in that the isolation
declaration device is programmed to send out an addressing

interrupt command at the moment when power is
applied to it. 
Installation according to one of Claims 11 to
15, characterised in that the isolation declaration device

is programmed to send the message every time it
receives an interrogation in this direction from a

functional unit (8).
Installation according to one of Claims 11 to
16, characterised in that the isolation declaration device

is programmed to send the isolation declaration
message cyclically.
Installation according to one of Claims at 11-17,
characterised in that the isolation declaration device

includes a manual control actuation of which
causes the message to be sent.
Installation according to one of Claims 11 to 18,
characterised in that the isolation declaration device

is programmed to test the sub-network addresses of the
messages which it perceives and to send a command invoking

the allocation of a new address when it detects
a sub-network addressing which differs from the predetermined

addressing.
Installation according to one of Claims 11 to
19, characterised in that the isolation declaration device

is physically assembled to a filter (41) designed
to isolate the two inputs (43, 45) of this filter from

one another with regard to communications signals.
Installation according to Claim 20, characterised
in that the filter (41) is designed to allow power

current to pass between the two inputs, but to prevent
the passage of communications signals of the "carrier

currents" type.

address to be adopted in the absence of an isolation

declaration message.
Functional unit according to one of Claims 22
and 23, characterised in that it is programmed to:
