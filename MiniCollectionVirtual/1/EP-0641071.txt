<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a logarithmic detector.A logarithmic detector is a detector which converts an input power signal into
a linear output current signal value and they are generally used in radio and radar
receivers.A conventional distributed logarithmic detector is shown in Figure 1. The
distributed logarithmic detector is a distributed device formed by a plurality of
amplifiers 1, individual detectors 2 and summers 3. The amplifiers 1a, 1b are linked
in series so that the input voltage across in the terminals 4 is applied as an input to
amplifier 1a while the output of amplifier 1a is applied as an input to amplifier 1b and
the output of amplifier of 1b is output from the distributed detector at output terminals
5. The amplifiers 1 are of the limiting output amplitude type. The detectors 2 each
have a logarithmic response and the detectors 2a, 2b, 2c are arranged to detect the
various voltages along the amplifier chain. Detector 2a detects the unamplified input
voltage before amplification by amplifier 1a, detector 2b detects the amplified output
voltage of amplifier 1a before amplification by amplifier 1b while detector 2c detects
the doubly amplified output of the amplifier 1b. The outputs from the detectors 2a, 2b
and 2c are all summed in summers 3a, 3b to provide a summed log output at log
output terminals 6.Distributed detectors of this type are used because the range of response of
the individual detector elements 2 is generally relatively small compared to the desired 
range of the complete distributed detector and the use of multiple detectors with
amplifier and summer chains allows the range of the distributed detector as a whole
to be extended to the desired range.Obviously the number of amplifiers, detectors and summers can be increased
as required to give a desired range of response.Detectors as described above are known e.g. from US-A-4 680 553.The overall log-linearity of the distributed detector is dependent on the log-linearity
of the individual detectors and the non log-linearity of known detectors is such
that the performance of known distributed logarithmic detectors is limited by it.Another problem with known detectors is that their log linearity is dependent on
the amplification factor of the amplifier they are associated with in a distributed
detector, the larger the gain the worse the log linearity. As a result to obtain good log-linearity
in known distributed detectors low gains must be used, so for a large range
a large number of stages are required, as well as the
