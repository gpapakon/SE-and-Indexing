<ABSTRACT>
To produce active carbon particles by carbonizing a carbon 
based raw material in a steam atmosphere while feeding 

electricity to the raw material received in a rotary reactor 
(7), a plurality of electrical receiving rods (6) are secured 

to the inner wall surface of a cylindrical wall (10) of the 
rotary reactor (7) in the equally-spaced relationship as seen 

in the circumferential direction. In operation, a certain 
intensity of electric current is fed to the electricity 

receiving rods (6) via a plurality of electrodes (13) and a 
plurality of electrode contacts (19) to induce arc-discharging 

between the electricity receiving rods (6) and the raw 
material received in the rotary reactor (7). To reliably 

prevent the temperature of the steam atmosphere from being 
abnormally elevated, carbon dioxide gas is introduced into a 

carbonizing chamber of the rotary reactor (7) via a gas inflow 
pipe (3). To rotatably support the rotary reactor (7), the 

gas inflow pipe (3), a steam inflow pipe (4) and a temperature 
sensor pipe (5), a rotary joint (1) is disposed at the 

position located outside of a side wall (10) of the rotary 
reactor (7). Nitrogen gas may be substituted for the carbon 

dioxide gas in order to attenuate the endothermic reaction 
arising in the rotary reactor (7). In addition, used active 

carbon particles can be re-activated in the carbonizing 
chamber of the rotary reactor (7) by feeding electricity to 

the used active carbon particles via the electricity receiving 
rods (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
producing active carbon particles by carbonizing a raw 
material in steam atmosphere while feeding electricity to the 
raw material received in a rotary reactor. A method of producing active carbon particles by dry-distilling 
a carbon based raw material, used active carbon 
particles or the like, and thereafter, feeding electricity to 
the raw material received in a rotary reactor so as to allow 
the raw material to be carbonized in the latter in a steam 
atmosphere is disclosed in an official gazette of Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication NO. 4-97905. According to the prior invention, the active carbon producing 
method is practiced such that a mixture gas atmosphere 
composed of a self-burnable gas (C) generated from the active 
carbon particles and a steam (H₂O) is heated to an elevated 
temperature ranging from 800 °C to 1000 °C to induce an 
endothermic reaction in the mixed gas atmosphere. This 
endothermic reaction is remarkably promoted with the mixture 
gas composed of carbon dioxide gas, hydrogen gas and oxygen 
gas after the temperature of the mixture gas atmosphere 
exceeds 800 °C, resulting in the temperature of the mixed gas 
atmosphere being abnormally raised up. Since the carbon 
dioxide gas in the mixture gas atmosphere required for 
inducing the endothermic reaction is obtained only from the 
self-burnable gas derived from the active carbon particles, 
when a quantity of the hydrogen gas obtained from the steam in 
the mixture gas atmosphere relative to the limited quantity of 
the carbon dioxide gas exceeds a predetermined one, there 
arises a malfunction that the temperature of the mixture gas  
 
atmosphere is abnormally elevated. The present invention has been made in consideration of the 
aforementioned background. An object of the present invention is to provide a method of 
producing active carbon particles by carbonizing a carbon 
based raw material in a steam atmosphere while feeding 
electricity to the raw material received in a rotary reactor 
wherein abnormal elevation of the temperature of a mixture gas 
atmosphere can reliably be prevented. Another object of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus for producing active carbon particles by carbonizing 
a carbon based raw material in a steam atmosphere while feeing 
electricity to the raw material received in a rotary reactor 
wherein a method is employed for practically operating the 
apparatus of the foregoing type. According to one aspect of the
