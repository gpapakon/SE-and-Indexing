<ABSTRACT>
The electrode layer of a ion exchange membrane is formed by 
printing a ink of catalytically active particles on the surface of the 

membrane. The inventive electrode ink comprises: 

(a) catalytically active particles; 
(b) a hydrocarbon having at least one ether, epoxy or ketone 
linkage and an alcohol group, preferably 1-methoxy 

2-propanol; and 
(c) optionally a binder, preferably perfluorinated sulfonyl 
fluoride polymer or perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a membrane and electrode structure
composed of an ion exchange membrane having a plurality of electrically
conductive, catalytically active particles present on one, or both, surfaces of
an ion exchange membrane. The electrically conductive, catalytically active
particles serve as a particulate electrode when the membrane and electrode
structure are used in an electrochemical cell. Membrane and electrode
structures are sometimes called solid polymer electrolyte structures or SPE
structures. The membrane and electrode structures are particularly useful in
fuel cells.So-called "M & E cells" are electrochemical cells employing a
membrane and electrode structure. Such cells can be operated as an
electrolytic cell for the production of electrochemical products, or they may
be operated as fuel cells for the production of electrical energy, gas
generating devices and processes, chemical synthesis devices, chemical
treatment and processing devices and methods, gas dosimeters and sensing
devices and the like. Electrolytic cells may, for example, be used for the
electrolysis of an alkali metal halide such as sodium chloride or for the
electrolysis of water. M & E cells are well known in the art.The contact of the gas-liquid permeable porous electrode with the
ion exchange membrane is an important factor for the efficiency of the
M & E cell. When the thickness of an electrode is nonuniform or the
contact between the electrode with the ion exchange membrane is not
satisfactory, a part of the electrode is easily peeled off adversely effecting the
electrical properties of the cell. The advantages of the M & E structure are
then decreased or lost.Membrane and electrode structures are currently manufactured by
several techniques. U.S. Patent No. 3,297,484 illustrates in detail materials
for electrode structures including exemplary catalyst materials for
electrodes, ion exchange resins for membrane and electrode structures and
current collecting terminals. Catalytically active electrodes are prepared 
from finely-divided metal powders, customarily mixed with a binder such as
polytetrafluoroethylene resin. The electrode is formed from a mixture of
resin and metal bonded upon one or both of the surfaces of a solid polymer
matrix, sheet or membrane.In U.S. Patent No. 3,297,484, the mixture of resin and catalytically
active particles is formed into an electrode structure by forming a film from
an emulsion of the material, or alternatively, the mixture of resin binder and
catalytically active
