<DESCRIPTION>
 STABLE FLUX JUMPING RESISTANT SUPERCONDUCTING TAPE AND SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETBACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a stable Nb,Sn superconducting tape and magnet wound with that tape which resist flux jumping. Superconducting magnets find wide application, for example, in the field of magnetic resonance imaging.As is well known, a magnet can be made superconducting by placing it in an extremely cold environment, such as by enclosing it in a cryostat or pressure vessel containing liquid helium or other cryogen. The extreme cold reduces the resistance in the magnet coils to negligible levels, such that after a power source, initially connected to the coil to introduce a current into the coils, is removed the current will continue to flow through the coils due to the negligible resistance, thereby maintaining a magnetic field.However, once a superconducting magnet has been ramped up and placed in persistent mode, it is important that persistent operation be maintained. If a liquid helium cooled superconducting magnet quenches, liquid helium rapidly boils off, large amounts of helium gas are 

created and significant cryostat pressures are generated. For any superconducting magnet system this is costly, has safety implications, an significantly disrupts operation resulting in down time. Also, in an MRI system the noise from the rapid rush of helium is greatly disturbing to patients and system operators.A superconducting magnet quench not only causes a disruption of service and use of the superconducting magnet and the MRI equipment, but also a time-consuming and expensive replenishment of the liquid helium cryogen and subsequent ramping up of the superconducting magnet is required. There is obviously a significant problem in such downtime and disruption of service of the MRI equipment. Moreover, the person who normally operates the MRI equipment is generally not trained or competent to reinstitute the superconducting mode of operation, requiring an expert or MRI technician be brought in to restart the superconducting magnet.Notwithstanding the highly undesirable results and expense of a superconducting magnet quench, occasional magnet quenches occur for unapparent and sometimes unexplained reasons. A great deal of research and development has been expended to ensure stable operation of superconducting magnets in the persistent mode. 

 One cause for superconducting magnet quenching and instability is a phenomenon known as flux jumping. By way of a simplified explanation, flux jumping is the
