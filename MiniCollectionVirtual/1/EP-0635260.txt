<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oil-based transparent gels characterised 
by a wide viscosity range, for use in the pharmaceutical and 
cosmetics sectors. The gels contain tartaric acid or malic acid diesters of C₁₂-C₁₃ 
single-branch fatty alcohols, possibly mixed with oils and other 
compounds such as silica and polyalcohols. Lipogels are physico-chemical structures which, if obtained in 
clear form, enable formulations to be prepared having a 
consistency similar to or even better than creams or modern gel 
emulsions, without the use of cellulose methacrylic polymers or 
other compounds typical of aqueous systems. Transparent lipogels have a particularly pleasing appearance, and 
compared with aqueous formulations have the advantage of not 
requiring preservatives and of being able to be used in very small 
quantity. Another important advantage of lipogels is the ability to obtain 
lipid structures with differing performance in terms of skin 
feeling, greasiness and the possibility of inserting liposoluble 
and water-soluble active principles, these being characteristics 
which facilitate the development of final applications.  However the preparation of gels with the required properties is 
not always easy. The literature describes various processes for preparing 
transparent lipogels. For example, Japanese patent 63223083 describes the preparation of 
transparent lipogels by heating mixtures formed from terpenes, 
paraffins and/or polyalcohols (oil base) and ionic surfactants 
deriving from fatty acids to 80°C, followed by slow cooling. The 
need to heat the mixtures results however in a considerable 
increase in the preparation costs of such formulations. Japanese patent 4059716 describes transparent lipogels prepared by 
cold-mixing pyrogenic silica with a non-ionic surfactant and a 
oily component consisting of a malic ester and olive oil. The 
formulations obtained have however only a moderate viscosity (7.5 
Pa. s) which limits their use for specific applications. An alternative method consists of using the vegetable origin 
gelling agent for oily components known by the commercial name of 
GP-100R, marketed by Ajinomoto, which enables transparent gels to 
be obtained without the presence of adjuvants. However the 
preparation method again comprises heating the mixture to about 
80-85°C. In addition the gelling agent cost is high and the 
consistency of the gels obtained is rather low. We have now found that it is possible to obtain transparent 
lipogels characterised by a wide viscosity range by
