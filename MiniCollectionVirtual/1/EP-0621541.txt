<ABSTRACT>
An automatic language determining apparatus automatically determines the 
particular Asian language of the text image of a document when the gross script-type is known 

to be, or is determined to be, an Asian script-type. A connected component generating means 
(28) generates connected components from the pixels comprising the text image. A character 

cell generating means generates a character cell surrounding at least one connected 
component. An optical density determining means determines the optical density, in absolute 

numbers or percentage of pixels, of the pixels within each character cell. A script feature 
determining means first generates a histogram, then converts, by linear discriminate analysis, 

the histogram to a point in a new coordinate space. A language determining means (36) 
compares the determined point of the text portion in the new coordinate space to 

predetermined regimes in the new coordinate space corresponding to at least one Asian 
language to determine the particular Asian language of the text image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for determining a language of a
script-type text portion according to the preamble part of claim 1 and a method of
automatically determining a language of a text portion according to the preamble
part of claim 10.Such a system and method are described in JP 5040846. This document
teaches a discrimination method to shorten time required for Japanese/European
language discrimination processing. After binarizing a document image, the number
of black runs in a row or column direction of the document is determined to measure
a line density and the Japanese/European language discrimination is performed
based on the statistical features of the measured line density.Optical character recognition and the use of optical character recognition to
convert scanned image data into text data suitable for use in a digital computer is
well known. In addition, methods for converting scanned image data into text data
and the types of errors such methods generate are well known. However, the proper
selection of the character recognition method is highly dependent upon the script
(alphabet or ideogram) used in the document. Further, the selection of a proper
method for error correction is highly dependent upon the language of the document.
Conventionally, the methods for optical character recognition and for error correction
in optical character recognition systems have been provided on the assumption that
the script and language used in the document is the usual script and language of the
country in which the system is being used. That is, in the United States,
conventional optical character recognition systems would assume that the document
is in English and uses Roman script, while in Japan, an applicable character
recognition system would be implemented assuming that the language is Japanese
and uses the Japanese scripts. Alternately, an optical character recognition system
can be implemented with the character recognition and error resolution methods for
a plurality of languages.However, it has heretofore not been possible to have the optical character
recognition system automatically determine the script type and/or language of the
document. Rather, as each document is provided to the optical character recognition
system, some indication of the particular language and script of the document
must be given to the optical character recognition system. This has been
accomplished by either having the operator input data concerning the language and 
script of the document to the
