<ABSTRACT>
Two- or three-dimensional position coordinates of 
an object (70) are measured without contact by installing 

at least one set of light emitting and receiving optical 
systems (15, 151, 152, 21, 211, 212) on opposite sides of 

the object (70). During measurement, the light emitting 
optical system (15, 151, 152) emits a laser beam towards 

the object (70) from a plurality of different directions, 
and light boundaries generated by the object (70) are 

detected by the light receiving optical system (21, 211, 
212). A computer (49) and a processor (50) are provided to 

compute two- or three-dimensional position coordinates of 
the object (70) from outputs of the light receiving optical 

system (21, 211, 212). Where three-dimensional position 
coordinates of the object (70) are required, one of the 

object (70) and the light emitting and receiving optical 
systems (15, 151, 152, 21, 211, 212) is moved vertically 

relative to the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and
a device for measuring in two or three dimensions and
without contact the position accuracy of mechanical components
after assembly such as, for example, mechanisms of
drums, posts and the like of video tape recorders (hereafter
abbreviated as VTRs).In recent years, in VTRs, efforts have been made
to improve the accuracy of mechanisms for high-density
recording. Also, in order to achieve compatibility between
systems, the technology for the high-accuracy measurement
of the position of components becomes important to minimize
variations between decks.Explained below is a conventional method of
measuring the position accuracy of components related to
VTRs after assembly.First, the mechanism of a VTR to be measured will
be explained. A rotary drum performs recording or playback
by means of a magnetic rotary head mounted at the bottom
end thereof, with a magnetic tape, supplied from a cassette,
wound diagonally around the rotary drum. The
magnetic tape is not to be run during the measurement. A
stationary drum has a stepped or shoulder portion known as
a lead which regulates the bottom edge of the magnetic 
tape. The rotary drum and the stationary drum constitute
a drum unit. A roller post positioned upstream of the drum
unit with respect to the direction of motion of the magnetic
tape stands vertically and regulates the upper-edge of
the magnetic tape in motion, and an inclined post changes
the direction of motion of the magnetic tape. These posts
are hereinafter referred to as upstream posts. An inclined
post positioned downstream of the drum unit with respect to
the direction of motion of the magnetic tape restores the
motion of the magnetic tape to its original direction, and
a roller post stands vertically and regulates the upper
edge of the magnetic tape. These posts are hereinafter
referred to as downstream posts. Thus, the measurement
object (object to be measured) in this example comprises
the drum unit, roller posts, and inclined posts, all of
which are regarded as the main components of the VTR
mechanism.Next, a conventional, contact-type device for
measuring position coordinates will be explained. First,
a measurement object is set on a reference plane of a
measurement platform. A probe which is affixed to the
contact-type device for measuring position coordinates is
capable of moving in X, Y and Z directions. Also, each of
the X, Y and Z coordinates is detected by a position
coordinate detection device. A computation device computes
the position
