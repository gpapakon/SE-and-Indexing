<ABSTRACT>
A cap (10) comprises a cap body (11) and a top lid (12), 
which are united by a 

hinge (13). A rubber-like elastic member (26) is provided on the cap 
body and/or the top 

lid such as to be elastically deformed between the cap body and the top lid when 
the top lid is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cap with improved opening and
closing functions of a top lid relative to a cap body.A cap in the related art comprises a cap body fitted on an open
portion of a container and a top lid to be opened and closed relative to the cap
body. Further, in a cap which is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open
Publication No. 3-69656 and also in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication
No. 63-88965, a leaf spring or a flexible body with self-hinge sections
provided between a cap body and a top lid provides
a biasing force to open the top lid.However, the leaf spring has a drawback in that it provides a strong
biasing force to quickly open the top lid. In addition, the leaf spring is generally
made of a metal and is readily rusted. Therefore, rust may be introduced into the
content in the container when the content is brought out of the container through
a nozzle in the cap body.The present invention has been developed to overcome the above-mentioned
drawbacks. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide
for a novel cap, which has no possibility of intrusion of rust in the container
content and permits its top lid to be opened gently at an adequate speed by the
restoring force of a rubber-like elastic member.As claimed a cap comprises:
a cap body having a top lid hinged thereto by a
hinge , said top lid being closed by a lock mechanism formed
on the cap body and on the top lid ; a rubber-like elastic member
positioned near said hinge and secured directly at one end to one
cap body or said top lid ; said rubber-like elastic member being
deformed between said cap body and said top lid when said top lid is
closed. According to the invention, the other end of the rubber-like elastic member is not
secured and has an
end having a wedge-like tapered shape, said wedge-like tapered
end being capable of compressive and bending deformations when
pushed by said top lid or said cap body.Also, according to the invention at least either one of the surfaces
of the cap body and/or the top lid and the rubber-like elastic member that are
spaced apart when the top lid is opened and are in contact with each other when
the top lid is closed is a non-flat surface.Thus, with the cap according to the invention, in which the
rubber-like elastic member provided between the cap body and the top lid is
elastically deformed when the top lid is closed, with the release of the lock
mechanism, the top lid is opened by the restoring force of the rubber-like
elastic
member that has been

<CLAIMS>
A cap (10) comprising:

a cap body (11) having a top lid (12) hinged thereto by a
hinge (13), said top lid being closed by a lock mechanism (24) formed

on the cap body and on the top lid ; a rubber-like elastic member
positioned near said hinge and secured directly at one end to one of said

cap body or said top lid ; said rubber-like elastic member being

deformed between said cap body and said top lid when said top lid is
closed ; characterized in that the other end of the rubber-like elastic member is not

secured and has
a wedge-like tapered shape, said wedge-like tapered

end being capable of compressive and bending deformations when
pushed by said top lid or said cap body.
The cap according to claim 1, wherein said hinge is a snap hinge.
The cap according to claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one of surfaces
of said cap body or said top lid and said rubber-like elastic member that are spaced

apart when said top lid is opened and are in contact with each other when said top
lid is closed is a non-flat surface.
