<ABSTRACT>
An infrared intrusion sensor comprising an array of infrared detectors (17), infrared collection optics which may include a Cassegrain-style telescope (11, 12), a focal plane scanning device (11, 12, 13), including dither means adapted to repetitively scan the infrared radiation across the detector array, signal process means and local or remote display means. The sensor may incorporate heterodyne detection techniques with a local oscillator signal derived from the scanning frequency of the focal plane scanning device. The sensor has a low false alarm rate and enhanced detection range. Also disclosed is a method of processing signals involving A/D conversion, integration of the digital signals to produce a background signal, phase sensitive detection of the digital signal producing a target signal and comparison of the background and target signals producing a difference signal. This difference signal is then integrated to produce a background noise signal and processed to become a threshold signal which is finally compared to the difference signal to produce an alarm signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an infrared intrusion sensor. In particular, the invention relates to an
infrared intrusion sensor which is a long range passive detection system designed for remote
unattended surveillance applications. The invention is expected to find applications in airfield
perimeter security, high grade fence line security, vital asset protection and other surveillance
environments.The sensor differs from other infrared intrusion sensors in that it has a superior detection
range compared to existing devices. Furthermore it provides more extensive information to
the operator. For example, the invention has the capability of indicating the direction of
movement of a target, number of targets, false alarm probability, near/far field indication and
failure/tamper indication.In one existing device designed for military use the useable range is 30 metres although the
optimum detection range is stated to be 6 metres. This device is admitted to have difficulties
with slow-moving targets between 15 metres and 30 metres. In another military device the
stated detection ranges are 3 to 20 metres for personnel and 3 to 50 metres for vehicles.Domestic intrusion sensors have a typical detection range of less than 20 metres. One known
civilian security sensor has a detection range of 100 meters but only provides a simple alarm.These existing intrusion sensors have technical limitations, the major limitation being the
relatively short range capabilities of these devices and unacceptably high false alarm rates.
Most existing sensors are not capable of indicating the direction of target movement, or if
they can indicate the direction of movement it is at the expense of other facilities.The one of the inventors is the inventor of the invention disclosed in AU-B-43598/85. In that
document a focal plane scanning device is disclosed.
Different parts of a view may be focused upon a detector element in a scanning arrangement.
There is no disclosure of use of heterodyne or equivalent techniques in AU-B-43598/85 which
form a significant part of the invention disclosed herein.It is an object of this invention to provide an infrared intrusion sensor having enhanced
detection range and low false alarm rate compared to existing devices. It is a further object of this invention to alleviate one or more of the above
mentioned problems or at least provide the public with a useful alternative.Therefore, according to perhaps one form of this invention, there is proposed
an infrared intrusion sensor comprising :
