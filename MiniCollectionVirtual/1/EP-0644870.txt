<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to perfluoroalkylated 
diamines, and more particularly to perfluoroalkyldiaminomesitylene 
and polymers, preferably 
polyimides, made therefrom. Polyimides represent an important class of high-temperature 
polymers with a broad range of applications. 
In the electronics industry, they are used in many 
applications which take advantage of their thermal 
stability, good electrical properties and other very 
useful characteristics. Polyimides, however, tend to 
absorb moisture, which results in changes in electrical 
properties under varied humidity conditions. 
Additionally, as the drive in electronics for smaller 
size continues, materials with improved dielectric 
properties, e.g., lower dielectric constant, are 
required. Fluorination has been used to reduce both moisture 
absorption and dielectric constant in polyimides. For 
example, Japanese Patent Application Publication (Kokai) 
No. 1-190652 (Appl. No. 63-12660), Japanese Patent 
Application Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 2-60933 (Appl. 
No. 63-211799), and Japanese Patent Application 
Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 1-18860 (Appl. No. 63-4760) 
disclose use of perfluoroalkyldiaminobenzene in 
preparing polyimides. However, the raw materials for 
preparing such diamines are not readily available, and 
thus, it is not easy to prepare the most stable 
homologue, which has all three groups (the two amine  
 
groups and the perfluoroalkyl group) in meta position 
with respect to each other on the benzene ring. In contrast, according to the present invention, 
the mesitylene ring, which is readily available in the 
form of bromomesitylene, is used in place of the benzene 
ring, so that the substituent groups (amine and 
perfluoroalkyl) have no other choice but be arranged in 
meta position with respect to each other. Use of the new fluorinated diamines according to 
the present invention is a viable route to produce new 
polyimides with reduced moisture absorption and 
dielectric constant. Likewise, other polymers based on 
these diamines, such as for example polyamides, 
polyureas, and the like may be made. In addition, the 
diamines of the present invention may be used in other 
applications, such as for example curing agents for 
epoxies, and the like. The instant invention is directed to 
perfluoroalkyldiaminomesitylene and polymers, preferably 
polyimides, or other compositions of matter, made 
therefrom. More particularly, this invention pertains to a 
composition of matter comprising the structure:
