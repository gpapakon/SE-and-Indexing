<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to normally tacky 
pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes. Synthetic 
rubber-based block copolymers are used extensively as a 
basis for pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions for 
a wide variety of uses. A problem that has proved to 
be particularly difficult is identified and a solution 
proposed. Pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions 
generally will function, under normal circumstances, 
against the substrate it was designed to be adhered to. 
However, conventional adhesives do not function 
adequately to that substrate when contaminated with 
grease or oil. The problem of adhering to oil 
contaminated surfaces with conventional 
pressure-sensitive adhesives, as a general problem, is 
recognized in the art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
3,991,002 describes a method for improving adhesion of 
normal pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes to oily or 
greasy substrates by treating the oil-contaminated 
substrate with a primer. This primer comprises a 
rubbery phase of an A-B-A triblock copolymer, such as a 
styrene-butadiene or styrene-isoprene block copolymer, 
and a resin blend of a resin compatible with the 
conjugated diene portion of the block copolymer and a 
resin compatible with the monovinyl aromatic 
hydrocarbon portion of the block copolymer (i.e., 
styrene). These components are placed in a solution, 
then applied as an aerosol to render the 
oil-contaminated surface stable for subsequent adhesion 
by a pressure-sensitive adhesive. This patent states  
 
that the conventional approach to adhering to oil-contaminated 
surfaces is a complicated and 
time-consuming clean-up prior to being adhered to by a 
conventional pressure-sensitive adhesive. However, the 
primer solution to the problem of oil contaminated 
surfaces proposed in this patent is still somewhat time 
consuming and impractical for most consumer 
applications. U.S. Patent No. 4,080,348 describes a 
pressure-sensitive adhesive composition which is stated 
to have superior "finger tack" as well as the ability 
to adhere to oily surfaces, such as skin. The adhesive 
disclosed contains a high proportion of simple diblock 
styrene-isoprene block copolymer admixed with a minor 
portion of a triblock styrene-isoprene-styrene or 
styrene-butadiene-styrene linear block copolymer 
tackified with solid tackifying resins. The specific 
formulations exemplified were alleged to have superior 
finger tack and the ability to adhere to skin. Generically, the art has recognized adhesive 
compositions based on block copolymers of
