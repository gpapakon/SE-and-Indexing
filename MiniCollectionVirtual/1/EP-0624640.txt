<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an aqueous liquid bleach composition which 
remains stable over an extended period of time. The liquid bleach is easily pou
rable since it 
has a relatively low viscosity. The liquid bleach generally comprises (a) from about 1% to 

about 25% by weight of a water-soluble bleach activator; (b) from about 0.1% to about 10% 
by weight of hydrogen peroxide; (c) from about 1% to about 20% by weight of a phase 

stabilizer; (d) from about 0.001% to about 2% by weight of a chelating agent; and (e) the 
balance water. The liquid bleach composition is isotropic, translucent and has a viscosity of 

less than about 500 cps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to liquid bleach compositions and more
particularly, to a stable, aqueous liquid bleach composition comprising a bleach activator,
hydrogen peroxide and a stabilizing system. The liquid bleach is isotropic, translucent and
has a viscosity of less than 500 cps, properties which are currently desired by users of liquid
bleaches.There are numerous categories of bleaches which are well known in the art. Of the
wide variety currently available, chlorine releasing bleaches, inorganic peroxygen bleaches,
and organic peroxyacid bleaches are the most common. The chlorine releasing bleaches
have certain disadvantages associated with their use such as, for example, their tendency to
weaken or degrade fabrics, a tendency to react with other components in the composition in
which they are present and their general propensity for fading colors in many dyed fabrics.
Additionally, under several bleaching conditions chlorine bleaches cause yellowing of certain
synthetic fabrics.While inorganic peroxygen bleaches overcome many of the disadvantages found
with chlorine bleaches, they have limitations on use in that they must be used at relatively
high temperatures, such as 85°C or higher. This drawback becomes significant in light of
the modern trend of using lower wash temperatures which are generally less than about 60°C
in order to reduce energy costs and prolong the life of the fabric. As a consequence, it is
generally necessary to improve the low temperature performances of inorganic peroxygen
bleaches through the addition of peroxygen bleach activators also known as peroxyacid
precursors.In the past, many have also attempted to use peroxyacid bleaches, either alone or in
combination with a bleach activator, as an alternative to the chlorine and inorganic
peroxygen bleaches described above. Unfortunately, upon dissolution in water, peroxyacid
bleaches such as peroxycarboxylic acids lose their active oxygen and convert to carboxylic 
acid. Thus, those in the past have found it difficult to formulate stable liquid bleaching
compositions.Many, however, have attempted to stabilize the peroxyacids in their compositions by
various means such as encapsulation or incorporation of stabilizing systems. Representative
of such attempts include Hardy et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,536,314; Thompson et al, U.S. Patent
No. 4,539,130; and Burns, U.S. Patent No. 4,606,838, all of which are commonly assigned.
All of these patents are directed to bleaching compositions containing peroxyacids and
bleach
