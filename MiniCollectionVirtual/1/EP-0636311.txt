<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the production of ricotta by means of 
acidifying milk serum heated at a predetermined 

temperature, comprising a tank (1) provided with 
feeding and discharging means (13) of the milk serum, 

heating means (20) and means for the metered 
introduction (53, 54) of an acid substance. The tank 

(1) has a bottom wall (18) communicating at one end 
thereof (4) with an outlet hopper (23) placed below the 

tank (1) and to which a motor-driven extractor 
assembly (5) of the ricotta is operatively associated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the apparatus 
employed in the dairy industry for the production of 
ricotta by means of acidifying serum of milk, 
originating from cheese production processing and 
heated at a predetermined temperature. More particularly, the invention is directed to such 
apparatus comprising a tank provided with feeding and 
discharging means of the milk serum, heating means and 
means for the metered introduction of an acid substance 
for obtaining the ricotta. Traditionally, in the apparatus for the production of 
ricotta of the above mentioned type the steps of 
collection and removal of the ricotta, floating on the 
surface of the milk serum within the tank, are 
performed manually, with the intervention of a team of 
workers under uncomfortable environment conditions. 
This is essentially due to the fact that the ricotta, 
before being delivered to the packaging lines, must be 
subjected to dripping so as to reduce the liquid phase 
contained therein in order to achieve a titer of about 
60-65%. The handicraft production of ricotta comprises 
transferring of the floating ricotta, collected by 
means of pierced scoops, onto splints of various shapes  
 
where it is maintained until final cooling and dripping 
inside a cold cell. Industrially, the ricotta is collected and loaded onto 
dripping cloths which in turn are folded into bags and 
raised in a suspended condition above the tank for the 
dripping of the serum. In other known apparatus, wherein the tank has a 
generally conical conformation, provision is made for 
extracting the ricotta from below, which avoids manual 
discharging. However, even in this case it is necessary 
to proceed to a successive dripping phase, by means of 
suitable dripping webs or centrifugal systems. In other apparatus known to the applicant, wherein the 
tank has a generally parallelepipedal conformation, the 
extraction of the coagulated floating material is 
performed by means of a finned web placed on top of the 
tank, which conveys the ricotta, for the reduction of 
the liquid phase, onto a further dripping web. In any case, the apparatus according to the prior art 
require long operative time for completing the cycle of 
production, do not enable to obtain ricotta having a 
low moisture titer as it would be on the contrary 
desirable for a higher quality product, and generally 
require a huge productive labour. The object of the present invention is to overcome the 
above drawbacks, and to provide an apparatus for the 
production of

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the production of ricotta by 
acidifying milk serum heated at a pre-determined 

temperature, comprising a tank (1) provided with 
feeding and discharging means (13) of the milk serum, 

heating means (20) and means for the metered 
introduction (53, 54) of an acid substance, 

characterized in that the tank (1) has a bottom wall 
(18) communicating at one end (4) thereof with an 

outlet hopper (23) placed substantially vertically 
below the tank (1) and to which a motor-driven 

extractor assembly (5) of the ricotta is operatively 
associated, and in that the tank (1) is further
