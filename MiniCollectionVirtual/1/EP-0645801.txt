<ABSTRACT>
The electric discharge lamp has a discharge vessel (4), which is 
mounted in 

an outer bulb (1). A containment shield surrounds the discharge vessel 
and includes a glass 

sleeve (11) and a helically coiled wire (12) about the sleeve. 
Electrically 

isolated clamping leads (10) 
extending from the seals axially secure the glass sleeve about the 

discharge vessel so 
that it is electrically isolated. The wire is fixed around the sleeve 

in an electrically 
floating manner, e.g. by clamping fit and/or by bent end portions 

secured over the ends 
of the glass sleeve. The construction of the lamp is simple and 

effective to protect the 
outer bulb from being damaged by an explosion of the lamp vessel 

and to prevent 
accelerated sodium depletion from the discharge vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric discharge lamp having 
an outer lamp envelope; a discharge vessel arranged within the outer envelope, the discharge vessel 
including a pair of electrodes between which a discharge is maintained during lamp 
operation, opposing seals sealing the discharge vessel in a gas-tight manner, and a 
conductive feed-through extending from each electrode through a respective seal to the 
exterior; frame means for supporting the discharge vessel within the outer envelope 
and for electrically connecting the discharge vessel to a source of electric potential 
outside of the outer envelope; and a containment shield comprised of a light-transmissive sleeve disposed 
about the discharge vessel and having opposing ends each adjacent a respective seal of 
the discharge vessel. Such a lamp is known from U.S. Patent 5,136,204. The purpose of the 
containment sleeve is to keep the outer bulb intact if the discharge vessel should 
explode, which may occur when the lamp reaches the end of its life. The presence of 
the sleeve, however, complicates lamp construction because it must be supported about 
the discharge vessel. In the known lamp the sleeve is quartz glass and has a wall 
thickness of 2 mm. Metal clips of complicated shape are secured on the press seals and 
include portions which hold the ends of the sleeve. The sleeve and discharge vessel are 
supported by welding the clips to an elongate metal support rod which is fixed around 
the lamp stem by a metal strap. The support rod, and consequently the metal clips and 
the sleeve, are electrically isolated which prevents accelerated sodium depletion from 
the discharge vessel. As compared to a non-shielded lamp in which the elongate support 
rod typically extends from the lamp stem or is welded to a stem conductor to carry 
current to the discharge vessel, the fixing of the support rod to the stem with a metal  
 
strap is more expensive and intricate. The clips further add to the number of lamp parts 
and increase lamp cost. It is known from EP-A-0 104 594 (U.S. Patent 4,721,876) to surround the glass sleeve by a 
meshwork of metal wire which is fixed around the sleeve with metal clamping strips. 
The provision of the meshwork enables a sleeve of smaller wall thickness to be used 
while still maintaining adequate containment. The clamping strips are electrically 
conducting and connected to a current-carrying conductive support rod of the lamp 
frame which supports the discharge vessel and the glass sleeve. The meshwork as a
