<ABSTRACT>
Thiols, disulfides and sulfenamides of certain pyridazines are effective accelerators in the sulfur vulcanization of rubber. These compounds, based on 3-pyridazine show improved rates of vulcanization and states of cure compared with known sulfenamide accelerators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain 3-pyridazine 
sulfenamides and to their use in 
rubber. A number of heterocyclic sulfenamides, thiols and 
disulfides have been well known, as has been their use 
in the vulcanization of rubber. The best known and most 
widely used are based on benzothiazole. Thus, the 
benzothiazole sulfenamides, such as N-t-butyl-2-benzothiazole 
sulfenamide (TBBS) and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole 
sulfenamide (CBS) have become standard 
accelerators of vulcanization. Similarly, the thiol 
derivative, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and the 
disulfide derivative, 2,2'-benzothiazole disulfide 
(MBTS), are standards of the industry. To a lesser degree, other N-heterocycles have 
been suggested as the basis for sulfenamides. For 
example, British Patent 795,174 describes a process for 
making a large variety of sulfonamide compounds for use 
as diuretics and antibacterial agents in which the 
sulfenamide equivalent is first made as an intermediate. 
Twenty-six different basic heterocycles are suggested, 
and a wide variety of substituents and fused ring 
variations are included, as well. Similarly, British Patent 1,342,046 discloses a 
process for making heterocyclic sulfenamides, based on 
diazine, triazine and pyridine thiols, encompassing an 
unlimited number of possible compounds, suggested to be 
effective vulcanization accelerators for rubber. US-A-2 382 769 describes rubber treatment technology, 
particularly rubber vulcanisation in the presence 
of a pyridazine sulfide. It has now been found that 
sulfenamides based on certain 3-pyridazyl moieties are  
 
particularly effective accelerators for the vulcanization 
of natural and synthetic rubber. More 
particularly, 3-pyridazine 
sulfenamides have been found to have superior 
accelerating effect on the vulcanization of natural and 
synthetic rubber, compared with similar compounds based 
on other heterocycles. The compounds of the present invention when 
utilized as accelerators for curing natural rubber, 
synthetic rubbers such as polybutadiene, EPDM or 
styrene-butadiene rubber, blends of rubbers such as 
natural rubber and polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene 
rubber and polybutadiene, or combinations thereof, 
result in improved cure rates as indicated by t90-t2 
values, t25-t2 values and maximum rate of vulcanization 
(Vmax), and higher extent of cure (cure efficiency), 
in comparison with traditional or conventional 
sulfenamide accelerators. Increased cure rates are very 
desirable since faster rates of production of rubber
