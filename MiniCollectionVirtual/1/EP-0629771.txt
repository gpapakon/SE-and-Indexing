<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust gas purification device comprising a
three way catalyst (17), an oxidizing catalyst (20) and a NOx

absorbent (23,24) which are arranged in this order in the exhaust
passage. A rich air-fuel mixture is burned in the

combustion chamber (3), and the exhaust gas discharged from
the engine (1) is initially introduced into the three way

catalyst (17). Secondary air is fed into the exhaust passage
between the three way catalyst (17) and the oxidizing catalyst (20)

so that the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing
into the oxidizing catalyst (20) and the NOx absorbent (23,24) becomes

lean.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine
exhaust gas purification device.If a ratio of the total amount of air fed into
the exhaust passage, the combustion chamber and the
exhaust passage upstream of a certain position in the
exhaust passage to the total amount of fuel fed into the
exhaust passage, the combustion chamber and the exhaust
passage upstream of the above-mentioned position in the
exhaust passage is referred to as an air-fuel ratio of
the exhaust gas at that certain position, in a known
engine, a lean air-fuel mixture is burned in the
combustion chamber, and a three way catalyst is arranged
in the exhaust passage, and a NOx absorbent, which
absorbs NOx when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas
flowing into the NOx absorbent is lean and releases
absorbed NOx when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas
flowing into the NOx absorbent is rich, is arranged in
the exhaust passage downstream of the three way catalyst
(see PCT international publication WO93/07363).Namely, in an engine, the amount of production
of NOx becomes maximum when an air-fuel mixture which is
slightly leaner than the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio is
burned, and the amount of production of NOx becomes
smaller as the air-fuel ratio of air-fuel mixture is made
leaner or richer with respect to the air-fuel ratio which
is slightly leaner than the stoichiometric air-fuel
ratio. In addition, when a lean air-fuel mixture is
burned, the amount of unburned HC and CO discharged from
the engine becomes considerably small, as compared with
the case where a rich air-fuel mixture is burned.
Accordingly, in the above-mentioned engine, the air-fuel 
ratio of the air-fuel mixture to be burned in the
combustion chamber is made considerably lean to reduce
the amount of NOx and unburned HC and CO discharged from
the engine as much as possible. In addition, at this
time, the NOx discharged from the engine is caused to be
absorbed by the NOx absorbent as much as possible, and
the unburned HC and CO discharged from the engine is
caused to be oxidized by the three way catalyst as much
as possible to reduce the amount of NOx and unburned HC
and CO discharged into the outside air.Among the harmful components in the exhaust
gas, NOx is a component which is the most difficult to
purify and, if this NOx can be reduced by the three way
catalyst, it is possible to considerably lower the amount
of NOx in the exhaust gas. However, if the air-fuel
ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, the three way catalyst
does not carry out the reducing operation of NOx.
