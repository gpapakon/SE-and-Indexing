<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive recording
materials
comprising a crosslinked polyepoxy compounds in the charge generating
layer.In electrophotography photoconductive materials are used to form
a latent electrostatic charge image that is developable with finely
divided colouring material, called toner.The developed image can then be permanently affixed to the
photoconductive recording material, e.g. a photoconductive zinc
oxide-binder layer, or transferred from the photoconductor layer,
e.g. a selenium or selenium alloy layer, onto a receptor material,
e.g. plain paper and fixed thereon. In electrophotographic copying
and printing systems with toner transfer to a receptor material the
photoconductive recording material is reusable. In order to permit
rapid multiple printing or copying, a photoconductor layer has to be
used that rapidly loses its charge on photo-exposure and also
rapidly regains its insulating state after the exposure to receive
again a sufficiently high electrostatic charge for a next image
formation. The failure of a material to return completely to its
relatively insulating state prior to succeeding charging/imaging
steps is commonly known in the art as "fatigue".The fatigue phenomenon has been used as a guide in the selection
of commercially useful photoconductive materials, since the fatigue
of the photoconductive layer limits the copying rates achievable.A further important property which determines the suitability of
a particular photoconductive material for electrophotographic
copying is its photosensitivity, which must be sufficiently high for
use in copying apparatuses operating with the fairly low intensity
light reflected from the original. Commercial usefulness also
requires that the photoconductive layer has a spectral sensitivity
that matches the spectral intensity distribution of the light source 
e.g. a laser or a lamp. This enables, in the case of a white light
source, all the colours to be reproduced in balance.Known photoconductive recording materials exist in different
configurations with one or more "active" layers coated on a
conducting substrate and include optionally an outermost protective
layer. By "active" layer is meant a layer that plays a role in the
formation of the electrostatic charge image. Such a layer may be
the layer responsible for charge carrier generation, charge carrier
transport or both. Such layers may have a homogeneous structure or
heterogeneous structure.Examples of active layers in said photoconductive
