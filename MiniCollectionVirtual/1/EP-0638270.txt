<ABSTRACT>
The set comprises a plurality of longitudinal channels forming an upturned U in section. The set is so designed that when one set is stacked on top of another, the bases of the channels of the upper set (14) act as lids for the corresponding channels of the lower set (15). Each channel has a movable extra base (14b, 15b) on which the bottom of the product to be cooked rests, while an elastic means (14c, 15c) providing an upward return action is arranged between the base of the channel and said extra base (14).

Stackable sets of containers intended to contain foodstuffs
during their cooking, of a type comprising a plurality of longitudinal U-shaped

troughs (1 to 4) facing upwards, said set being designed such that,
when two sets are stacked on top of each other, the bases of the troughs

(1a to 4a) of the upper set act as covers for the corresponding troughs in
the lower set, characterized in that each trough (1 to 4) is equipped with

an additional moveable base (14b, 15b) on which the lower part of the
product to be cooked rests, an elastic raising means (14c, 15c) being

provided between the base of the trough (1a to 4a) and said additional
base (14).
Stackable sets according to claim 1, characterized in that the
elastic means (14c, 15c) is constituted by a curved blade which is

narrower than the trough.
Stackable sets according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the additional base (14b, 15b) is constituted by a flat sheet slightly

narrower than the trough and slightly shorter than the trough.
Stackable sets according to claim 3, characterized in that said
additional base sheet has slightly raised longitudinal edges.
Stackable sets according to claim 3, characterized in that said
additional base sheet has slightly sloping longitudinal edges.
Stackable sets according to claim 2, characterized in that said
additional base sheet, instead of being horizontally flat, is the shape of the

base of a gutter, concave towards the top, with sloping longitudinal edges.
Stackable sets according to claim 4, characterized in that said
slightly raised longitudinal edges are each extended by a descending part

followed by a raised part.
