<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hinge (4) for 
constraining a door (3) to a support structure 

(2), which hinge (4) is constituted by a first 
part (6) fixable to the support structure (2) and 

a second part (7) fixable to the door (3) The 
second part (7) is connected rotatably about a 

rotation axis (5) to an end of a lever (8), which 
with its other end associates rigidly but 

removably to the said first part (6), in such a 
way that the second second part (7) can rotate in 

two directions about the rotation axis (5). 
Blocking-unblocking means (21) of the door (3) are 

provided, and elastic means (10) acting between 
both parts (6, 7) and determining in successive 

order, following deactivation of the blocking 
means (21) leaving the door (3) free, the 

application of at least a first moment to the 
second part (7) to determine a rotation of the 

second part (7) about the rotation axis (5) to 
produce at least a partial opening of the door  

 
(3), and the application of at least a second 

moment to brake the further rotation of the second 
part (7) about the rotation axis (5) due to the 

weight of the door (3) itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hinge for constraining 
a door to a support structure. In particular, the invention concerns a hinge 
which can be used to constrain the doors of 
electrical domestic appliances such as ovens, to 
the support structure of the appliances. For simplicity, in the following description 
reference will be made to an oven, but this should 
not be taken as a limitation on the use of the 
invention. Hinges of this type are usually constituted by two 
distinct and stably and kinematically connectable 
parts. Each part comprises a box structure having 
a more or less vertical development. The two box 
structures are rigidly fixable to the support 
structure, which in this case is the oven itself, 
and to the door near to its lower edge so that the 
door is tiltingly openable. A lever is pivoted to the part of the hinge solid 
to the door, more specifically to the box  
 
structure constituting it. The pivot about which 
the lever is hinged to the box structure coincides 
with the rotation axis between the door and the 
oven structure. The lever is removably constrainable to the lower 
end of a longitudinal slot made in the other part 
of the hinge, that is in the other box structure 
which is fixed to the oven. The end of the lever exiting from the box 
structure it is pivoted to is destined to be 
rigidly associated with the other box support 
structure, fixed to the oven, and it exits from a 
respective longitudinal slot in the box structure 
itself. As mentioned above, for greater 
functionality the lever is arranged close to an 
end of the box structure to which it is pivoted, 
and the extreme transversal edges of the slot act 
as end-run stops for the lever. The longitudinal 
wall of the box structure comprising the slot acts 
as an end-run stop for the lever in its closed-door 
configuration, and the nearby transversal 
wall, which usually delimits the slot, acts as an 
end-run stop for the lever in its open-door 
configuration. Elastic means act on the lever, interposed between  
 
the lever and the box structure of the part of 
hinge associated to the door. More precisely, the 
elastic means operate between the box structure 
and a rod internal to it. The rod is free to move 
along the box structure containing it and is 
pivoted at its free end, that is with its end that 
does not interact with the elastic means, to the 
lever. The fulcrum between the rod and the lever 
is situated in a zone of the lever which is 
interposed between the fulcrum of the lever and 
the box
