<ABSTRACT>
The atrial defibrillator (30) includes a first detector (38) for 
detecting R waves of the heart, a second detector (40) for detecting T 

waves of the heart, and a third detector (44,46) for detecting atrial 
activity of the heart. The atrial defibrillator further includes an 

atrial fibrillation detector (70) responsive to the third detector 
(44,46) for determining when the atria of the heart are in need of 

cardioversion, and a cardiovertor for applying the cardioverting 
electrical energy to the atria of the heart when the atria of the heart 

are in need of cardioversion, after the second detector (40) detects a T 
wave, and in timed relation to an R wave detected by the first detector 

(38) after the detected T wave is completed. The R wave detected after 
the 
detected T wave is completed is the first R wave detected by the 
first detecting means after the detected T wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an atrial
defibrillator.
The present invention is more particularly directed to a
fully automatic implantable atrial defibrillator which
exhibits improved safety by reducing the potential risk of
induced ventricular fibrillation which may result from the
mistimed delivery of cardioverting electrical energy to the
atria of the heart. More specifically, the atrial
defibrillator of the present invention guards against
applying cardioverting electrical energy to the atria of
the heart under conditions believed to contribute to
induced ventricular fibrillation.Atrial fibrillation is probably the most common
cardiac arrhythmia. Although it is not usually a life
threatening arrhythmia, it is associated with strokes
thought to be caused by blood clots forming in areas of
stagnant blood flow as a result of prolonged atrial
fibrillation. In addition, patients afflicted with atrial
fibrillation generally experience palpitations of the heart
and may even experience dizziness or even loss of
consciousness.Atrial fibrillation occurs suddenly and many times can
only be corrected by a discharge of electrical energy to
the heart through the skin of the patient by way of an
external defibrillator of the type well known in the art.
This treatment is commonly referred to as synchronized
cardioversion and, as its name implies, involves applying
electrical defibrillating energy to the heart in
synchronism with a detected ventricular electrical
activation (R wave) of the heart. The treatment is very 
painful and, unfortunately, most often only results in
temporary relief for patients, lasting but a few weeks.Drugs are available for reducing the incidence of
atrial fibrillation. However, these drugs have many side
effects and many patients are resistent to them which
greatly reduces their therapeutic effect.Implantable atrial defibrillators have been proposed
to provide patients suffering from occurrences of atrial
fibrillation with relief. Unfortunately, to the detriment
of such patients, none of these atrial defibrillators have
become a commercial reality.Implantable atrial defibrillators proposed in the past
have exhibited a number of disadvantages which probably has
precluded these defibrillators from becoming a commercial
reality. Two such proposed defibrillators, although
represented as being implantable, were not fully automatic,
requiring human interaction for cardioverting or
defibrillating the heart. Both of these proposed
defibrillators require the patient to recognize the

An implantable atrial defibrillator (30) including a first detector (52)
for detecting R waves of a heart (10), a third detector (53) for detecting atrial activity of the

heart (10), an atrial fibrillation detector (70) responsive to the third detector (53) for
determining when the atria (16, 18) of the heart are in need of cardioversion, and a

cardiovertor (82) for applying cardioverting electrical energy to the atria (16, 18) of the
heart (10) when the atria (16, 18) of the heart (10) are in need of cardioversion, the atrial

defibrillator characterized by:

a second detector (51) for detecting T waves of the heart (10); and wherein
the cardiovertor (82) applies the cardioverting electrical energy to the atria
(16, 18) of the heart (10) when the atria (16, 18) of the heart are in need of cardioversion,

after the second detector (51) detects a T wave, and in timed relation to an R wave detected
by the first detector (52) after the detected T wave is completed, the R wave detected after

the detected T wave is completed being the first R wave detected by the first detector (52)
after the detected T wave.
The atrial defibrillator (30) of claim 1 further characterized by a
timer (62) responsive to the second detector (51) for timing a predetermined delay time

upon the detection of the detected T wave and the cardiovertor (82) being further
responsive to the timer (62) for applying the cardioverting electrical energy to the atria (16,

first predetermined time period and wherein the timer (62) only times the predetermined
delay time when the detected T wave is detected within the first predetermined time period.

timer (62) is responsive to the first detector (52) detecting an R wave within the first

predetermined time period for retiming the first predetermined time period.

timer (62) is responsive to the first detector (52) detecting an R wave within the

predetermined delay time for retiming the first predetermined time period.

predetermined time period without a T wave being detected to detect for a further initial R
