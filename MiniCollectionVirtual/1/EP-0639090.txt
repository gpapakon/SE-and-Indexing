<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to self-propelled
fluid delivery devices and specifically to
controlled discharge drug infusers.In particular the invention relates to an infuser
apparatus for the delivery of a fluid at a controlled rate
of flow comprising in combination:
a housing having a first portion and a second
portion, said housing defining an inner chamber, said
inner chamber having a first and a second inner surface;a deformable member disposed in said inner chamber,
inlet means for introducing fluid into said inner chamber
in between said deformable member and said first inner
surface, said deformable member and said first inner
surface defining a fluid storage means.
Such an infuser apparatus is known from DE-A-3 542 729.Numerous devices have been utilized in the past for
infusing drugs or other liquid solutions to persons
requiring extended exposure to such solutions. In order to
avoid the operational complexities associated with
externally powered pumping devices, a great deal of
inventive effort has been focused on devices having
internally powered mechanical delivery mechanisms. One concept that has received considerable
attention involves the use of a deformable bladder such as
that disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,419,096 to Leeper et al.
As explained in Leeper, however, a fundamental operational
difficulty encountered by the use of a deformable bladder
is non-uniformity of operation resulting in a pressure
spike near the end of the fluid dispersion cycle. This
pressure spike results in a corresponding surge in fluid
flow to the patient which is generally undesirable. Leeper
addresses this problem by inclusion within the bladder of
means to maintain the bladder in a slightly bulbar
configuration. The detriment associated with this
configuration is, of course, that the medicinal fluid is
not completely expelled from the bladder and is therefore
wasted. A number of other patents have disclosed
configurations utilizing bladders but none appear to have
the capability of completely delivering the stored
contents at a controlled pressure and flow rate.To avoid the inherent problems of non-uniform
delivery associated with devices such as Leeper, wherein
flow is inherent through the collapse of an elastic 
bladder, a number of alternative concepts have emerged
utilizing various driving means to expel the fluid
contained in the infusion device. These include inter
alia, the spring loaded piston of Turner et al. U.S.
