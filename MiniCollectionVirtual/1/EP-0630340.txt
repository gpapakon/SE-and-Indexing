<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filing and storage 
systems, such as box files and index card boxes and 
particularly to systems of this kind which are designed to 
facilitate "self assembly". It is particularly, although not exclusively, 
concerned with filing and storage systems of the kind 
disclosed in our prior International Patent Application, 
Publication Nos. 90/05643 and 92/00857. These applications 
are concerned with filing and storage systems which provide 
various configurations of files and-file boxes, and the 
present invention seeks to provide further improved 
configurations of articles of this kind. A box formed from a foldable blank which can be 
used for display and shipping purposes is disclosed in U.S. 
4,413,726. However the configuration of overlapping base 
and lid makes it unsuitable for use as a box file, since it 
cannot be opened out flat for access to the contents. According to a first aspect of the invention there 
is provided a blank for constructing a box file or card index 
box, which, in the made up form comprises a 
pair of similar half shells, the blank including a pair of 
base members each having a pair of outwardly extending side 
portions on two opposite sides; characterised in that the 
side portions are so shaped that they can be bent up to form 
triangular side walls, and in that each side portion is 
joined to a third, adjacent rectangular side portion by an 
inwardly foldable connection section which is adapted to 
form a right angled corner when the blank is folded into 
shape; whereby the two half shells are mirror images of 
each other, and each has a pair of opposite triangular 
side walls which are respectively complementary to those of 
the other half shell, and one side wall which is 
rectangular, so that the closed box has opposite rectangular 
ends each of which exhibits a diagonal cut line 
where the corresponding triangular walls of the two half  
 
shells meet, and whereby the two half shells are hinged 
together along a common edge. 
This construction has the 
particular advantage, in use, that papers can be retained in 
either half of the box when it is open, and are not likely 
to fall out because each half shell has retaining walls 
around three sides. The term "half-shells" is used herein to describe 
the two halves of a box structure which when suitably 
positioned next to one another, form an enclosed box. Where 
these are described as being "mirror-images", this implies 
that they are (for example) identical shapes, or  
 
complementary shapes

<CLAIMS>
A blank for constructing a box file or card index 
box, which, in the made up form comprises a 

pair of similar half shells, the blank including a pair of 
base members (2, 2a) each having a pair of outwardly 

extending side portions (4, 6; 4a, 6a) on two opposite 
sides; characterised in that the side portions (4, 6; 4a, 

6a) are so shaped that they can be bent up to form 
triangular side walls (8, 10), and in that each side portion 

(4, 6; 4a, 6a) is joined to a third, adjacent rectangular 
side portion (16, 16a) by an inwardly foldable connection 

section (18, 20; 18a, 20a) which is adapted to form a right 
angled corner when the blank is folded into shape; whereby 

the two half shells are mirror images of each other, and 
each has a pair of opposite triangular side walls (8, 10) 

which are respectively complementary to those of the other 
half shell, and one side wall (16, 16a) which is 

rectangular, so that the closed box has opposite rectangular 
ends each of which exhibits a diagonal cut line where the 

corresponding triangular walls of the two half shells meet 
and whereby the two half shells are hinged together along a 

common edge. 
A blank according to claim 1 in which the said 
pair of base members are joined by a shared side wall (16) 

to which they are joined on opposite sides. 
A blank according to any preceding claim in which 
the inwardly folded section
 at each corner is retained in 
position by folding over it, a further outwardly extending 

flap portion on one of the adjacent sides.  
 
A blank according to claim 1 of card or like 
material for constructing a box file, which, in the made up 

form, comprises a pair of similar half shells hinged 
together along a common edge, each half shell comprising a 

tray like member having a base with an upstanding side wall 
extending along one edge, and two opposed end walls in the 

form of right angle triangles, the two half shells being 
hinged together along a line which defines the top edge of  

 
the upstanding side wall of one half shell, and the edge of 

the base which is opposite the upstanding side wall, of the 
other half shell, so that when closed, the end walls of the 

box show a diagonally extending line at the junction of the 
two half shells; the blank comprising: 


(a) a first rectangular portion forming the base 
of one half shell; 
(b) a first inwardly foldable connection section 
forming a first pair of double-triangular flaps, one 

extending from each end of the first rectangular portion, 
and each being so shaped as to be foldable to form one of 

the said triangular end walls; 
(c) a second rectangular portion, connected by a 
common edge to a third side of the first rectangular 

portion, and being narrower than the said first portion so 
as to form one upstanding side wall; 
(d) a second inwardly foldable connection section 
forming a second pair of double triangular flaps connected 

to opposite sides of the second rectangular portion, and 
each of which has one side in common and connected to one 

corresponding side of the adjacent first double triangular 
flap; 
(e) a third rectangular portion of the same size 
as the first rectangular portion, and adapted to form the 

base of the other half shell and thus the opposite side of 
the box; and 
(f) a third inwardly foldable connection section 
forming a third pair of double triangular flaps extending 

from opposite sides of the said third rectangular portion 
and each being so shaped as to be foldable to form one of 

the said triangular end walls;

the opposite side to the said second rectangular portion; 

and 
(h) a fourth inwardly foldable connection section 
forming a fourth pair of double triangular flaps, each  

 
of which is arranged at one end of the said fourth 

rectangular portion, and is connected by one of its other 
edges to the adjacent edge of the corresponding third 

double triangular flap. 
A blank according to claim 4 further comprising a 
fifth large rectangular portion, attached to a free edge 

of the first large rectangular portion, and adapted to be 
folded over onto it, so as to finish and hold in position 

the sides of the first half shell, and a sixth, small 
rectangular portion, corresponding in size to, and connected 

to the free edge of, the said fourth rectangular portion, so 
as to correspondingly finish and hold in position the end 

wall and the triangular side walls of the second half 
shell. 
A blank according to claim 5 in which the fifth 
large rectangular portion is made with additional fold 

lines to enable it to be folded into a flattened box section 
to reinforce the free edge of the first large rectangular 

portion.
