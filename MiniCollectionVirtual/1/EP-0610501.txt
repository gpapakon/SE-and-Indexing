<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid pressure
device wherein a plurality of blocks having different
functions are combined into a single unit.A fluid pressure device such as a vacuum generating
unit is constructed by connecting together a plurality of
blocks having different functions, and which are provided
respectively with peripheral devices such as a feed valve
for supplying either vacuum or compressed air, a vacuum
break valve, an attraction confirmation switch serving as a
vacuum detecting means, a timer, a display, etc. Further,
electrical mechanisms are electrically connected to a
control device such as a sequencer or the like by signal
conductors or wires, such as discrete lead wires or the
like, to thereby transfer control signals therebetween.A vacuum generating unit according to the prior art is
shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 shows a structure for connecting
signal wires between a vacuum generating device 2 and a
sequencer 4 which serves as an external device, in which
ejectors respectively having different vacuum attracting or 
sucking conditions are set as vacuum generating sources.
The vacuum generating unit 6a is constructed by connecting
peripheral devices such as a compressed-air feed valve 12a,
a vacuum break valve 14a, an attraction confirmation switch
16a, etc. to a block 10a having an ejector provided
thereinside and a vacuum port 8a. The vacuum generating
unit 6a, and other vacuum generating units formed in a
manner similar to the vacuum generating unit 6a, are placed
on a manifold 18 to thereby form the vacuum generating
device 2. Compressed air is supplied from an unillustrated
compressed-air feed source to the vacuum generating units 6a
through 6e through a compressed-air feed port 20, so that
negative pressures are generated by the ejectors
respectively. In the vacuum generating units 6c through 6e,
for example, negative pressures are supplied respectively
from vacuum ports 8c through 8e to corresponding suction
pads 24c through 24e through vacuum tubes 22c through 22e.
Thus, the suction pads 24c through 24e attract and feed
workpieces 26c through 26e.The sequencer 4 has input keys 28 and a display unit 30
comprised of an LCD, both provided on an upper surface
thereof. Further, the sequencer 4 has signal terminals 32
respectively connected to objects to be controlled.The peripheral devices of the vacuum generating units
6a through 6e provided on the manifold 18 are separately
connected to the signal terminals 32 of the sequencer 4 by a
plurality of signal conductors or wires 34.
