<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic power steering system includes a pump (1), a flow 
control valve (4), and a bypass control valve (20). The flow control 

valve (4) responds to a pressure drop across a metering orifice (3) 
disposed in a fluid supply passage (2) so as to control the flow 

rate of operational fluid by bypassing part of the operational 
fluid to a reservoir (11). A spring chamber (6a) of the flow control 

valve (4) is connected to the supply passage (2) through a control 

orifice (7). The bypass control valve (20) is disposed between the 
spring chamber (6a) and the reservoir (11) so as to increase the amount 

of bypassed fluid by controlling the pressure in the spring 
chamber (6a). The bypass control valve (20) has a control spool (21), 

a load 
pressure introduction port (23A) connected to the upstream side of 

the control orifice (7) for leading the load pressure to a first 
end of the control spool (21) and a pilot port (23B) connected to the 

downstream side of the control orifice (7) for leading the 
pressure in the spring chamber (6a) of the flow control valve (4) to a 

second end of the control spool (21). Moreover, a pressure 
receiving area of the second end of the control spool (21) is 

smaller than that of the first end of the control spool (21). 
Accordingly, a spring (22) having a small spring constant can be 

used in the bypass control valve (20), even when the control spool (21) 
is controlled within a short stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic power 
steering apparatus suitable for use in automobiles and the 
like. FIG. 1 shows a conventional hydraulic power steering 
apparatus in which a bypass control valve is employed to 
reduce the energy consumption. 
Such a steering apparatus is disclosed in EP-A-0 594 137 
published on 27.04.94 (state of the art according to Article 
54(3) EPC). 
The power steering apparatus 
comprises a pump 1, a power cylinder 14, a reservoir 11, and a 
control valve 13. This control valve 13 is provided with 
variable throttles V1, V2, V3 and V4 disposed in four passages 
which are connected to the pump 1, a pair of chambers of the 
power cylinder 14 and the reservoir 11 and which form a bridge 
circuit. The power steering apparatus further comprises a 
flow control valve 4 and a bypass control valve 9. The flow control valve 4 is composed of a valve spool 4a 
and a spring 6 disposed in a spring chamber 6a formed at the 
back of the valve spool 4a. The flow control valve 4 is 
disposed in a bypass passage 5 and the flow of fluid flowing 
from an inlet port 5a to an outlet port 5b of the flow control 
valve 4 is controlled by the valve spool 4a. A connection  
 
port 6b of the spring chamber 6a is connected to a supply 
passage 2 via a control orifice 7 and to the reservoir 11 via 
a relief valve 8. The valve spool 4a responds to a pressure 
difference between the upstream side and downstream side of a 
metering orifice 3 disposed in a supply passage 2 which 
connects the pump 1 and the control valve 13 so that the 
bypass passage 5 is opened and closed by the valve spool 4a in 
accordance with the pressure difference, thereby maintaining 
the flow rate of operational fluid supplied to the control 
valve 13 constant. The connection port 6b of the spring 
chamber 6a is also connected to the reservoir 11 via the 
bypass control valve 9 which is composed of a control spool 9a 
having slits 9b at its rear end and a spring 10 disposed at 
the back of the control spool 9a. The slits 9b form a 
variable orifice which controls the flow of operational fluid 
flowing to the reservoir 11. The bypass control valve 9 is 
also connected to the supply passage 2 so that the back 
pressure of the control valve 13, i.e., load pressure is lead 
to the front side of the bypass control valve 9. When the 
back pressure of the control valve 13 is low, i.e., the 
control valve 13 is in a neutral state, the control spool 9 is 
moved to the left as viewed in FIG. 1 so that the variable 
orifice is
