<ABSTRACT>
A TiSi₂/TiN clad LI strap process and structure are disclosed which 
combine the advantages of both TiSi₂ and TiN LI processes. According to the 

invention, the retention of a thin TiN layer (12) between the local 
interconnect (e.g. TiSi₂ 14) and contacts (e.g. TiSi₂ 16) provides a diffusion 

barrier against counterdoping and relaxes the thermal budget for subsequent 
processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The use of local interconnect (LI) for connecting poly gates and emitters to diffusion areas and for
connecting N + and P + across field oxide regions allow an increased packing density for submicron VLSI
circuits and a reduction in parasitic junction capacitance. See Titanium Nitride Local Interconnect
Technology for VLSI by T. Tang, C.C. Wei, R.A. Haken, T.C. Holloway, L.R. Hite and T.G.W. Blake, IEEE
Trans. Electron Devices, Vol. ED-34, 3 (1987) p. 682. TiN has been used as an LI. However, TiN is very
difficult to etch without damaging a silicide layer on a substrate.Both TiN and TiSi2 LI structures have been developed which are compatible with a self-aligned silicide,
or salicide, process. See HPSAC-Silicided Amorphous Silicon Contact and Interconnect for VLSI by D.C.

Cass, J. Amano, and K.Y. Chiu, IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, Vol. ED-34, 3 (1987) p. 587. The original
process for TiSi2 LI begins with deposition of an amorphous silicon layer onto titanium. The Si layer is
photographically defined and etched. Annealing in N2 causes the remaining Si to react with the underlying
Ti to form TiSi2, while exposed Ti regions react with the ambient N2 to form TiN. The TiN is then
selectively removed with an H2SO4 + H2O2 solution. In the original process, both contacts and LI are
formed simultaneously. Because a high selectively to Ti as between Ti and Si can be achieved by dry
etching in a fluorine-based chemistry, this process has an etch advantage over the standard TiN LI process,
which exhibits less selectively to the salicided substrate. However, there are two major disadvantages of this
process: namely, thermal diffusion of substrate Si into the overlying titanium layer can lead to pitting of the
substrate, and counterdoping between P + and N + regions may occur through the LI strap during both
silicide formation and subsequent high temperature processing since phosphorous diffuses rapidly in TiSi2.
The method according to the present invention was developed to overcome these problems.EP-A-0 517 368 discloses a method of forming a local
interconnect (LI) for integrated circuits and a LI structure
formed as a result of said method, with said method
comprising depositing a refractory metal layer such as
titanium over the integrated circuit including silicon,
depositing a barrier layer such as titanium nitride
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for forming a local interconnect interconnecting source/drain (4) and gate (8) regions comprising:

depositing a first titanium layer over a semiconductor
body having a plurality of source/drain regions and a plurality

of gate regions and including silicon, the first titanium layer contacting said source/drain and gate region;
annealing the structure thus formed by the foregoing
process step in N
2
 so as to form a plurality of titanium
silicide regions (3,5) distinct from each other at the contacted surfaces of

said plurality of source/drain regions and said plurality of
gate regions and to form a titanium nitride barrier layer

overlying and connecting said titanium silicide regions;
depositing a second titanium layer on said titanium
nitride barrier layer;
depositing silicon on said second titanium layer
deposited on said titanium nitride barrier layer;
patterning and etching said silicon, leaving said
silicon only where said local interconnect is desired;
annealing the structure thus formed by the foregoing
process steps in N
2
 so as to convert said second titanium
layer under said silicon to a titanium silicide layer (14) and

convert said second titanium layer elsewhere to a titanium
nitride (12); and 
substantially wet etching away exposed regions of said
titanium nitride barrier layer and said titanium nitride (12) but

not said titanium silicide layer (14), wherein a portion of said
titanium nitride barrier layer that extends beyond said

titanium silicide layer (14) remains, and wherein the titanium
silicide region at the contacted surfaces of said plurality of source/drain regions and the

titanium silicide region at the contacted surfaces of said plurality of gate regions extend
beyond the remaining portions of said titanium nitride barrier

layer.
