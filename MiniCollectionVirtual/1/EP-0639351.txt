<ABSTRACT>
The implant possesses a supporting rod (2) for the mutual support of the vertebrae adjoining the implant on either side. An implant body (3) which is preferably assembled from several parts is pushed onto the support rod (2) perpendicular to the rod axis, and for this purpose the implant body is provided with grooves (4) which are open at the sides on its circumference and receive the support rod (2). Morover, the implant body (3) is provided on its front faces (5) with a surface structure which results in mutual fixation of the adjoining surfaces (5) of the implant body (3), on the one hand, and the vertebrae, on the other hand.

An implant for replacing vertebral bodies and/or for stabilising
and fixing the spinal column, in particular in the event of vertebral

resection, comprising a support bar (2) having centering points (1) at both
ends for mutually supporting the vertebral bodies adjoining the implant on

both sides, characterised in that an implant body (3) is pushed on to the
support bar (2) transversely with respect to the bar axis and for that

purpose is provided with a groove (4) which is laterally open at its
peripheral surface and which receives the support bar (2) and that at its

end faces (5) which are intended to bear against the vertebral bodies
adjoining the implant the implant body (3) is provided with a surface

structure (10, 12) which affords mutual fixing of the mutually contacting
surfaces (5) of the implant body (3) on the one hand and the vertebral

bodies on the other hand.
An implant according to claim 1 characterised in that the implant
body (3) is divided transversely with respect to the support bar (2) into at

least two parts (6, 7, 8) which bear against each other with flat division
surfaces (9) which are perpendicular to the axis of the support bar (2),

that provided on each of the division surfaces (9) is a respective tooth
ring (10) centred on the axis of the support bar (2) and the mutually

contacting parts (6, 7, 8) of the implant body (3) are in mutual positively
locking engagement in the peripheral direction by way of said tooth rings

(10), and that the parts (6, 7, 8) of the implant body (3) are rotatable
relative to each other about the axis of the support bar (2) in such a way

that at respective immediately adjacent parts (6, 7 and 7, 8 respectively)
the mouth openings (11) of their grooves (4) at the peripheral surface are

displaced relative to each other in the peripheral direction.
An implant according to claim 2 characterised in that the tooth
rings (10) are formed by teeth which project out of the division surface (9)

and which have a radially extending tooth cutting edge. 
An implant according to claim 2 or claim 3 characterised in that,
when the implant body (3) has a flat end face (5) which is perpendicular

with respect to the axis of the support bar (2), the surface structure is
formed by a tooth ring (10) as on the division surfaces (9).
An implant according to one of claims 2 to 4 characterised in that,
in the case of an end face (5) which is inclined with respect to the axis of

the support bar (2), the surface structure is formed by spikes (12)
projecting from the end face (5).
An implant according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that
the support bar (2) is of a circular-cylindrical cross-section of a diameter

equal to the width of the groove (4).
An implant according to one of claims 2 to 6 characterised in that
the implant parts (6, 7, 8) are in the form of circular-cylindrical portions

which are centred on the axis of the support bar (2), with mutually parallel
end faces (5, 9) or at most one end face which is inclined relative to the

axis of the support bar (2).
An implant according to claim 7 characterised in that in the case
of an implant body (3) or one of its parts (6, 7, 8) having an end face (5)

which is inclined with respect to the axis of the support bar (2) the groove
(4) extends in a radial direction which is approximately perpendicular to

the direction of fall (13) of the end face (5), from the centre to the
peripheral surface.
An implant according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that
the implant body (3) or its parts (6, 7, 8) have axially extending holes

(10) in the form of through bores or blind bores. 
An implant according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that
the implant body (3) or its parts (6, 7, 8) have a roughened surface.
An implant according to claim 10 characterised in that the implant
body (3) or its parts (6, 7, 8) comprise a porous metal foam.
