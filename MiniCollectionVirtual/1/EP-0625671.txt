<ABSTRACT>
A pig (2) is moved through the pipeline (1) to be renewed, the breaking-up device (4) of said pig exerting radial forces, acting from the outside in, on the pipeline. Said forces are generated by correspondingly shaped breaking-up cutters (8, 9). The breaking-up process is assisted by pulling elements (7) which are in the form of bars and connect the breaking-up device (4) to a front guide portion (3) of the pig. The pipeline pieces (10) pass into the interior of the new pipe (6), which is drawn in by the pig, and are transported away through said new pipe, to be precise under the simultaneous action of a transporting fluid.
