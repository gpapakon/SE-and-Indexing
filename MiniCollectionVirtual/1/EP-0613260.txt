<DESCRIPTION>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a diversity receiver
system used in a digital communication, and more particularly,
to a diversity receiver system capable of having a
stable reception performance in spite of a condition of
receiving a signal and capable of suppressing a power
consumption.There are conventionally well known diversity receiver
systems each having a plurality of reception antennas and
which are used in a land mobile radiotelephone system, a
mobile communication system, a portable telephone set
system and a satellite communication system or the like.
In such a receiver system, each of reception antennas
receives a signal relative to the same data so as to output
only demodulation data selected from a plurality of the
same data which are received by respective antennas. There
will be described later a conventional diversity receiver
system, for example, a diversity receiver for a portable
telephone set system having two reception antennas.
Document JP-A-05 030084 discloses a prior
art diversity receiver.FIG. 1 schematically shows a constitution of such a
conventional diversity reception system.In FIG. 1, reception antennas 10 and 20 respectively
receive a radio signal transmitted from a base station. The signal received by the reception antenna 10 is
supplied to a reception circuit 11 in which a frequency of
the signal is converted into a base band signal, thereby
outputting an in-phase component I1 and an quadrature
(orthogonal) component Q1 to a delayed detection circuit 12,
respectively.The delayed detection circuit 12 performs a delayed
detection with respect to the in-phase component I1 and the
quadrature component Q1 both supplied, respectively, so as
to output reception clock component extraction signals Id1
and Qd1 which are generated by the wave detection.A digital phase-locked loop (hereafter abbreviated to
a DPPL) circuit 13 receives the reception clock component
extraction signals Id1 and Qd1 to generate an internal
clock. The internal clock is delivered to be used for
judging a positive and negative of the reception clock
component extraction signals Id1 and Qd1.In the same manner of this, a signal which is received
by the reception antenna 20 is also converted in its
frequency into a base band signal in a reception circuit
21, and a delayed detection circuit 22 performs a delayed
detection with respect to an in-phase component I2 and an
quadrature component Q2 included in the base band signal to
generate reception clock component extraction signal
