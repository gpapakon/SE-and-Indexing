<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to a patent of invention related 
to an electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit, the purpose 
of which is to receive and transmit data via fiber optics 
of a synchronous digital hierarchy, acting also to synchronize 
the system clocks, all this being included in a sole line module 
with circuits which are necessary for performing the above-mentiones 
functions. This invention applies to the telecommunications, and specifically, 
being a part of the wideband communications systems through 
fiber optics. Prior to the development of wideband systems, the digital communications 
were based on a plesiocronous digital hierarchy, characterized 
in the non-existence of synchronization between different 
data affluents of each nevel of hierarchy. In order to cut down the costs of multiplexing equipment, a synchronous 
digital hierarchy was introduced, the main feature of 
which is the need for synchronizing different affluents of each 
hierarchy The above implies the need for introducing into the equipment 
several systems destined to synchronize clocks.  On wideband equipment, a lot of information is generated, for 
which the most suitable transmission means is the optical fiber 
because its high capacity; the transmission systems incorporate 
functions such as to receive, transmit, recover clocks and synchronize 
clocks. There are, at present, several systems incorporating all these 
functions, although all them operate with independent circuit - 
cards, these solutions presenting a series of problems such as 
the interconnection for high speed data, apart from utilizing 
large areas for printed circuits, which means high costs of equipment. There is a general trend to achieve systems incorporating several 
functions of this type in a same module, although nothing is 
known about the existence of any module in the market performing 
all them. An evident solution to this problems would be to rely on an 
element joining in a sole unit all the above-mentioned functions, 
so obtaining an evident improvement, and, of course, a solution 
to the posed technical problems. Nevertheless, up till now nothing is kown about the existence 
of an invention providing those characteristics contemplated as 
suitable. The electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 Synchronous 
Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit as proposed by 
this invention constitutes, per se, an evident solution to the 
present problems on

1.- An electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit, characterice 

in that it is constituted by a receiving subunit (12), a 
transmitting subunit (34), a clock generating and synchronizing 

subunit (19) and an alarm subunit (41) performing data transmitting 
and receiving functions thru an optical fiber, at a basic - 

speed of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (155.530 Mhz), as well as 
a clock synchronizing function for wideband communications systems. 
2.- An electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1

to claim 1, characterized in that a laser (38) from the transmitting 
subunit (34) turns off when no data is emitted. 
3.- An electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit, according 

to claim 1, characterized in that the receiving submodule (12) 
performs a clock recovery function starting from data from an 

input optical fiber (40) and times again an output data signal, 
delivering a recovered clock signal (18) both to an user and 

the clock generating and synchronizing submodule (19). 
4.-An electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit, according 

to claim 3, characterized in that the receiving submodule (12) 
blocks, through an AND gate (17), the data output when an alarm 

is generated due to a fall of input optical power. 
5.- An electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit, according 

to claim 1, characterized in that the clock generating and synchronizing 
submodule (19) synthesizes a clock at a transmitting speed 

(155.520 Mhz), starting from other one of 128 Khz, which originates, 
 

in a selectable manner, in a recovered clock (18) on the receiving 
submodule (12), or, also, in a 2.048 reference clock (25), 

or, also, in a third 128 Khz reference clock (23). 
6.- An electrooptical line module for transmitting in Level-1 
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy with synchronizing unit, according 

to claim 1, characterized in that it generates an alarm (43) 
when the laser (38) has suffered an excess degradation in its 

characteristics, generating an alarm (42) when the power of the 
input optical signal falls under a certain threshold, and a 

third alarm (44) to warn the existence of any of them, which is 
liable to be used by other systems to which the module may be 

connected.
