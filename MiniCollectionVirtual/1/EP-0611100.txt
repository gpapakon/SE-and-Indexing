<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a circuit for monitoring the power of a transmitter 
amplifier. In the solution according to the invention, the detected DC voltage level 

(V
det
) corresponding to the output power is compressed at high output levels by using 
as the coupling capacitance a capacitance diode (7) such that the capacitance of this 

component, and thereby the tightness of the coupling, diminishes as the detected 
voltage level increases. The invention can be employed, for example, in the power 

control of a mobile phone's transmitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for measuring output power from an amplifier. 
The invention can be employed, for example, in controlling the power of a radio 
telephone transmitter. In high frequency technology power detectors are used, amongst other things, for 
generating the necessary feedback signal for power regulation. This signal is usually 
a sample taken with a directional coupler from a forward RF field and is rectified to 
a corresponding DC level that is dependent on the magnitude of the forward power. The prior art is discussed in the following with reference to the accompanying 
Figure 1, which presents a wiring diagram of a power detector according to the 
prior art. In the circuit shown in Figure 1, the directional coupler marked with the reference 
number 1 has been implemented utilising microstrip. When the sampled power is 
rectified, this yields the detected DC voltage level Vdet corresponding to the output 
power Pout. In the figure the power detector diode is marked with the number 2, the 
capacitors with the numbers 3, 4 and the resistors with the numbers 5, 6. It is often necessary to make the directional coupler's coupling coefficient large so 
that with small voltage levels the DC voltage can be detected and its gradient of 
change can be made sufficiently large. This has the drawback that with large voltage 
levels the detected DC voltage level grows far too large. In devices operating at low 
operating voltage levels such as radio telephones, the processing of this signal, of 
which the level is excessively large, becomes impossible and thus the power range 
that must be used is limited as a consequence of this. A patent related to an automatic control circuit of the output of RF power amplifiers  
 
having a wide dynamic range has previously been presented (US-4 602 218). As far 
as extending the power range is concerned, the circuit according to the patent is 
based on the use of a logarithmic amplifier. In the circuit according to the patent, a 
linearly dependent RF sample level (the coupling coefficient being constant) is taken, 
for the detector, from the power level with a coupling capacitor and then the sample 
is shaped with the logarithmic amplifier before the detection. This is a complicated 
way of implementing the function in question and the solution calls for a lot of 
components. The present invention provides a circuit for monitoring power output (POUT) from an 
amplifier, comprising controllable sampling means for sampling the power output 
(POUT) from
