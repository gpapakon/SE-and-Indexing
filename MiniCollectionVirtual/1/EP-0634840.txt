<ABSTRACT>
A method of tailored error protection coding is disclosed. An 
illustrative coding method according to the present invention concerns encoding a 

first signal and a second signal to provide error protection for the signals, wherein 
the first signal requires greater error protection than the second signal. According to 

the method, the first signal is encoded with a first error protection code. The 
encoded first signal is then combined with the second signal. The combination of the 

encoded first signal and the second signal is further encoded with a second error 
protection code to generate a combined error protected signal, wherein the first 

signal is coded with both the first and second error protection codes. A second 
embodiment concerns the use of separate coders which apply different error 

protection codes to two signals. The two encoded signals are then combined into a 
single signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems for communicating a
plurality of information signals over a channel and more particularly to error
protection coding arrangements for use in such communication systems.A communications system comprises a transmitter coupled to a receiver
via a communication channel. The system functions to send and receive information
signals. In the course of communicating information signals through the channel,
such signals may be corrupted by channel noise and other error sources (e.g., fading)
associated with the channel. In a digital communication system, these error sources
may be responsible for, among other things, altering the content of the information
received. To help prevent such error sources from corrupting received information
signals, any of a number of channel coding techniques may be utilized in system
transmitter and receiver design.Generally, a channel coding technique helps mitigate the effects of error
sources by introducing so-called "redundancy" to the information to be
communicated. Because of this redundancy, the likelihood that noise will corrupt
communicated information is reduced. Some communication errors may be
completely eliminated.Some communication systems transmit more than one information
signal over a single channel. This may be accomplished with use of a conventional
multiplexer combining individual information signals into a combined signal for
transmission over the channel. To mitigate the effects of channel error sources on
the communication of the combined information signal, a channel coder is applied to
the combined signal. The coded result may then be provided to, for example, a
conventional interleaver to help reduce the effects of fading.The use of a single channel coder for a combined information signal can
adequately guard against channel errors, but it can also be wasteful of bandwidth.
This is because each of the individual information signals which form the combined
information signal may have its own distinct level of robustness to channel errors.For example, an audio signal and a separate information signal
representing alphanumeric characters may be multiplexed into a combined
information signal for transmission over a radio channel. Such an audio signal might
be Beethoven's 5th symphony, while the alphanumeric signal might identify or 
advertise (in advance) the transmission of music to be played, to wit, "Beethoven's
5th Symphony." Such an advertisement might be displayed to an interested listener.Channel errors
