<ABSTRACT>
In the drying apparatus for rotary printing press for drying 
the ink on the printed paper which has a direct fired deodorizing 

apparatus and a heat recovery apparatus for heating the hot 
air circulating in a drying apparatus by using the exhaus
t gas 
from the deodorizing apparatus, the drying apparatus and its 

control device are so adapted that a bypass line is installed 
on the hot air circulation line to bypass the heat recovery 

apparatus to control the temperature of printed paper and/or 
the temperature of hot air blowing from nozzles by adjusting 

the degree of opening of bypass damper disposed in the bypass 
line, and the burning amount of the burner for deodorization is 

controlled so that the deodorizing apparatus furnace temperature 
corresponding to the blowing hot air temperature or paper 

temperature is obtained. Further, the control device carries 
out the control in response to the change in printing speed. 

Thus, the control responsiveness can be enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drying control device for printed 
paper drying apparatus which evaporates the solvent in ink by 
blowing hot air onto the printed paper. More particularly it 
relates to a hot air heating type drying apparatus for a rotary 
printing press which evaporates the solvent in ink by feeding 
printed paper into a drying apparatus body having a negative 
pressure and by blowing hot air onto the paper. The apparatus, 
according to this invention can be applied to exhaust gas 
disposal apparatus for solvent-containing substances in the 
production process of plastic film and the like. Still more 
particularly, this invention relates to a paper temperature 
control device of drying apparatus for a rotary printing press. A conventional drying apparatus for a printing press will be 
described with reference to FIG. 5. Reference numeral 1 denotes 
a drying apparatus body, 2 denotes printed paper, 3 denotes a 
hot air blowing nozzle provided in the drying apparatus 1, 4 
denotes a burner for heating the hot air, 5 denotes a blower 
for the first zone, 6 denotes a blower for the second zone, and 
7 denotes an exhaust gas blower, and 8 denotes a deodorizing 
apparatus. The paper 2 printed by the printing press is fed into the 
drying apparatus body 1, and the hot air from the burner 4 is 
blown onto the paper through the hot air blowing nozzles 3 so 
that the solvent in ink is evaporated. The hot air, which has 
been blown onto the paper 2 in the drying apparatus body 1 from 
the hot air blowing nozzles 3, is returned to the suction side 
of the blower for the first zone 5 and the blower for the  
 
second zone 6, and is then reheated by the burner 4 and sent to 
the hot air blowing nozzles 3. Part of the hot air is sucked by 
the exhaust gas blower 7 and sent to the deodorizing apparatus 
8, where the gas is deodorized. Part of the deodorized gas is 
returned to the drying apparatus body 1, and the remnant is 
discharged into the atmosphere. For pollution prevention, a 
negative pressure is produced in the drying apparatus body 1 to 
prevent the hot gas (exhaust gas) in the drying apparatus body 
1 from discharging to the outside. The conventional drying apparatus for a rotary printing press 
shown in FIG. 5 has the following disadvantages: 
(1) The apparatus has a high consumption of fuel because the 
fuel supplied to the burner 4 is burned to reheat the hot 
air circulating in the drying apparatus body. (2) The operation cannot be performed while the amount of exhaust 
gas is restricted
