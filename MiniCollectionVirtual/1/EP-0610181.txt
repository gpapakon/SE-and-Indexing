<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for use in 
conjunction with the manufacture of components of rotary 
valves such as are used in hydraulic power steering gears 
for vehicles. Such rotary valves include an input-shaft 
which incorporates in its outer periphery a plurality of 
blind-ended, axially extending grooves separated by 
lands. Journalled on the input-shaft is a sleeve having 
in its bore an array of axially extending blind-ended 
slots matching the grooves in the input-shaft, but in 
underlap relationship thereto, the slots of one being 
wider than the lands of the other so defining a set of 
axially extending orifices which open and close when 
relative rotation occurs between the input-shaft and the 
sleeve from a centred position, the magnitude of such 
rotation henceforth referred to as the valve operating 
angle. The edges of the input-shaft grooves are contoured 
so as to provide a specific orifice configuration often 
referred to as metering. These orifices are ported as a 
network such that they form sets of hydraulic Wheatstone 
bridges which act in parallel to communicate oil between 
the grooves in the input-shaft and the slots in the 
sleeve, and hence between an engine driven oil pump, and 
right-hand and left-hand hydraulic assist cylinder 
chambers incorporated in the steering gear. The general method of operation of such rotary valves 
is well known in the art of power steering design and so 
will not be described in any greater detail in this 
specification. A description of this operation is 
contained in USA Patent 3,022,772 (Zeigler), commonly held 
as being the "original" patent disclosing the rotary valve 
concept. According to that patent, the input-shaft and 
sleeve are biased towards the centred position by a 
torsion bar spring. Thus when small input torques are  
 
applied to the steering wheel and hence the input-shaft, 
only a small magnitude of relative rotation occurs between 
the input-shaft and sleeve and, for such low valve 
operating angles, little power assistance is provided by 
the valve. For larger input torques proportionately 
greater valve operating angles are generated, leading to 
much greater levels of power assistance. The relationship 
between the level of power assistance generated in the 
valve, as a function of input torque, is known as the 
valve pressure characteristic. This valve pressure 
characteristic is therefore determined by the geometry of 
the changing orifice area as a function of valve operating 
angle. Such rotary valves are
