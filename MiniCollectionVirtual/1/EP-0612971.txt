<ABSTRACT>
A method for charging explosives in substantially horizontal 
bore-holes, with a loading density reduced in relation 

to that corresponding to the complete fill up of the 
bore-hole diameter with the explosive in bulk form, comprising 

that a charging hose with an end opening is introduced into at 
least one bore-hole of a blasting round, that a pumpable and 

coherent bulk explosive is pumped through the charging hose at 
a controlled rate, that simultaneous with the pumping of explosive 

the hose is withdrawn at a controlled rate, that the 
pumping and withdrawal rates are adjusted to form a coherent 

string exiting from the hose end opening, said exiting string 
only partially filling up the bore-hole diameter. An apparatus 

for charging explosives in bore-holes in controlled volume 
amount per bore-hole length unit comprises, a vessel (31) containing 

a pumpable and coherent bulk explosive (32), a charging 
hose (45) adappted for insertion into the hole-hole, a 

conduit (38) connecting the vessel with the hose, pumping means 
(33,34) for moving the explosive from the vessel through 

the conduit and the hose at a controlled rate, hose moving means 
(44,48) allowing forward movement of the hose and withdrawal 

of the hose at a controlled rate and adjusting means 
(34,48) for setting the ratio between pumping rate and hose 

withdrawal rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for charging
explosives in substantially horizontal bore-holes, with a loading
density reduced in relation to that corresponding to the
complete fill up of the bore-hole diameter with the explosive
in bulk form.In many blasting applications it is desirable to have a
charging method providing explosive of reduced and variable
bulk strength. In driving tunnels or galleries careful blasting
of the contour holes will give a substantially undamaged
rock face with strongly reduced needs for subsequent repair
and support work such as bolting, gunniting, concrete reinforcement
etc. and the final profile will be true the design size.
Similar considerations may arise in underground mining and
stopig or for the purpose of limiting production of fines to
meet certain after-processing constraints.Although numerous small and closely spaced bore-holes
can be used to produce smooth fracture planes, the method is
limited by practical and economical reasons and conventionally
careful blasting has been carried out by partial charging of
oversized boreholes with small-diameter cartridges or tubes.
Another approach is the errangement of spatially separated and
individually ignited deck charges at regular intervals in the
borehole. The methods are expensive both in labour and equipment.
Frequent problems are inconsistency in charging and uncontrolled
coupling between explosive and rock. Detonation failures
have also been experienced for certain explosives, supposedly
due to precompression from forerunning shock waves in
the free gas channel. Introduction of shells or spacers concentric 
with the charge have improved positioning but added to
cost and complicated charging procedure.To meet the general trend towards wider boreholes and
bulk charging of explosives also in connection with careful
blasting, bulk explosives of strongly reduced energy concentration
have been developed, such as ANFO mixed with porous
lightweight material. The complete fill out of large drill holes
with explosive places severe demands for energy reduction
and the explosive often approaches its detonation limit.
Although the positioning problems mentioned in connection with
the packaged products are avoided with bulk explosives, the
coupling to the rock surface is stronger and the blast result
will be markedly dependent on any inhomogenity present in the
explosive. These problems are pronounced by the pulverulent
nature of the explosives used. The lightweight materials usually
employed for energy reduction are

A method for charging explosives in substantially
horizontal bore-holes, with a loading density reduced in

relation to that corresponding to the complete fill up of
the bore-hole diameter and with the explosive in bulk

form, wherein a charging hose with an end opening is introduced
into at least one substantially horizontal bore-hole

of a blasting round, characterized by pumping an explosive
in fluid or viscous form as a cohesive mass

through the charging hose at a controlled rate into said
substantially horizontal bore-hole(s), the charging hose

being withdrawn at a controlled rate simultaneously with
said pumping, and the pumping and withdrawal rates being

adjusted so as to form while exiting from said hose end
opening a coherent string of said cohesive explosive mass
