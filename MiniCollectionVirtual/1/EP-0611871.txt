<ABSTRACT>
It is made up of a relatively resilient and elastic material, and has a V-shaped profile of which the two arms (18, 19) are free and at rest form an angle slightly less than 90@, the apex (20) of the square (corner key) being tapered into a point, the said square being designed to house its arms in corresponding open grooves (12) provided in the two sections opposite rims (17) which are effectively parallel to the grooves, such that the square can be deformed by a force exerted on its apex substantially in the direction of the bisector of the angle formed by the two arms towards the centre of the frame, moving these arms into the grooves, separating them, until the moment when the apex can be slipped under the rims in the corner which they form at the junction of the two sections and against which it engages before the square is elastically relaxed by release of the force exerted.

<CLAIMS>
Alignment key (11) for window frames (1) or the 
like, which is intended to be associated with two mitred 

metal section pieces (2, 3) which once assembled together 
form the angle or corner of the window frame or the like, 

the said key being designed to house its legs in open 
homologous grooves (12) provided in the two section 

pieces facing rims (17) which are respectively parallel 
to the grooves, characterized in that it is made of a 

relatively flexible and elastic material, and has a 
V-shaped profile, the two legs (18, 19) of which V are 

free and at rest form an angle slightly smaller than 90Â°, 
the vertex (20) of the key being shaped into a point so 

that the key can be deformed by a force exerted on its 
vertex substantially in the direction of the line which 

bisects the angle formed by the two legs in the direction 
of the centre of the frame, shifting these legs into the 

grooves, while separating them, until the vertex can be 
slipped under the rims in the angle formed where the two 

section pieces meet and against which rims it fits, 
before elastic relaxation of the key by release of the 

force exerted. 
Key according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it is made of a plastic which has a certain degree of 

flexibility allowing the temporary deformation of its V 
profile, especially made of polyethylene, polyamide, 

polypropylene, or alternatively semi-rigid polyvinyl 
chloride. 
Key according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that its upper face, in line with its V-shaped 

vertex 20, is made slightly thinner by a chamfer  
 

(21) to allow the vertex to fit under the rims (17) of 
the two section pieces (2, 3). 
Key according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the lateral legs (18, 19) have some 

of their thickness cut away (21) to make it easier for 
them to fit into the grooves (12) of the section pieces 

(2, 3) where they move, as a result of the force exerted 
on the vertex (20).
