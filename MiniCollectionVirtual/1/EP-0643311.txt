<ABSTRACT>
An antenna system comprises a main antenna (1) for use in 
transmission and reception and a pair of sub-antennas (2) for 

use only in reception. The antenna beam of the antenna 
system is scanned in the direction of the beam width to be 

compressed. Both received signals of the main antenna (1) and 
the sub-antennas (2) are fed to a signal processing circuit (4). 

The signal processing circuit (4) converts these received 
signals to power signals and then performs signal processing 

on them. In this signal processing, the power signal 
received by the main antenna is output as a final output 

signal only if both double differential coefficients of the 
received signals received by the main antenna and the sub-antennas 

are equal to or less than corresponding predefined 
positive real number values, and if the phase difference 

between the power signal received by the main antenna and 
the power signal received by the sub-antennas is equal to or 

less than 90°, thereby producing the output signal 
representing faithfully the distribution of scattering 

objects without distortion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
performing beam compression on the antenna pattern of
a radar, which can provide improved performance under
such beam compression without introducing distortion.In general, the beam width is one of the indexes
representing the performance of an antenna pattern of
a receiving antenna or other type antennas. A
narrower beam width of an antenna pattern will give a
better performance. However, there is a relationship
of inverse proportion between the beam width and the
size (length) of an antenna. Therefore, if the beam
width is reduced, then the size of the antenna should
be increased. Conversely, if the dimension of the
antenna is reduced, then the beam width should be
broadened.For example, in an antenna for a radar system, if
it is desired to double the ability or the resolution to
discriminate objects, it is required to halve the beam width and
thus it is required to double the size of the antenna. The
doubling of the size leads to not only a larger occupied 
region but also various disadvantages such as an increase
in the weight of the antenna and in the size of a structure
for supporting the antenna. Conversely, if the size of an
antenna is halved, then the beam width will be doubled and
the discrimination ability will be degraded by a factor of
two.It is well known that there is such a conflicting
relationship between the beam width and the size of an
antenna. In most cases, an actual antenna has a limitation
in the region it can occupy. Therefore, under these limited
conditions, a certain degree of compromise associated with
the beam width has to be made.One known beam compression technique to alleviate the
above-described problems is to reduce the beam width by
means of multiplication of received signals of a plurality
of antennas according to the multiplicative array principle. Fig. 1 of the
accompanying drawings is a schematic diagram illustrating the
configuration of a radar system which can perform beam
compression in such a manner described above. In this
figure, reference numeral 101 designates a main antenna
such as an array antenna comprising a plurality of radiation
elements which are equally spaced along a straight line.
Reference numeral 102 designates a sub-antenna disposed
apart from the main antenna 101 in the X-direction, which is
the direction of the beam-width to be reduced. Reference 
numeral 103 designates a transmitting circuit which
generates transmission power, which is in turn fed to the
main antenna 101. Reference numeral 104
