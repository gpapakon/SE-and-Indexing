<ABSTRACT>
Biofilters (3) for treating contaminated air (5) use immobilized biofilms on filter support media to biodegrade sorbed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and biotransform inorganic oxides to sulfur (SOx) and nitrogen (NOx) to residuals such as carbon dioxide, water and various acids (HCL, H2SO4, HNO3). The buffers in the trickling liquid (9) neutralize the acid. Some preferred support materials include pelletized solids, pelletized peat, pelletized compost, pelletized activated carbon, hydrogel beads, ceramics, and straight passage media such as extruded ceramics and extruded carbon. Pelletized supports and straight passage supports permit removal of excess biomass by hydraulic or chemical cleaning and minimize pressure loss. The biofilters are characterized by low pressure drop across the bed, good contact of influent gas with the biomass, and satisfactory biomass adherence to the support. The biofilters are easily cleaned of excess biomass or are self-cleaning.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves biodegradation and/or biotransformation
of volatile contaminants in the gas phase under controllable
aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions. The invention has
broad application for removing volatile, harmful contaminants
in the gas phase.Recently there has been increased interest in the removal
of organic and inorganic contaminants present in low concentrations
from gas streams. Conventional technologies that have
been used industrially for organics include (1) adsorption onto
porous substances such as activated carbon; (2) absorption into
liquid medium followed by stripping of the liquid; (3)
combustion or incineration; and (4) pervaporation using
selective membranes to selectively remove the harmful volatiles.
Lime treatment is used in scrubbers to remove sulfur
oxides from stack gases. Chemical addition and reaction is
based on control of nitrogen oxides. These technologies
present several problems, including disposal of generated
wastes (for example, calcium sulfate, unused lime and spent
activated carbon), cost of equipment, materials and energy
required for operation.While biological treatment of aqueous waste streams has
been an established practice, the use of biofilters for
treatment of air or gaseous streams has not been extensively
investigated in the United States. Pomeroy and Carlson have
reported an approach for removal of sewage-related odors
(Pomeroy, R.D., "Controlling Sewage Plant Odors". Consulting
Engineers Vol 20: (1963) p. 101; Carlson, et al, "Soil Beds
for the Control of Sewage Odors", J. Water Pollution Control
Federation, Vol. 38: No. 5 (1966) 829-840. The primary
mechanism for removal of the odorous compounds such as hydrogen
sulfide, mercaptans, terpenes, amines, etc, may have been
adsorbed on support material. There was no disclosure of 
biodegradation. It is, furthermore, known that soil beds are
effective in removing sulfur-containing gasses and can serve
as a sink for hydrocarbons.In more recent years, methods for use of biofilters have
been disclosed in Europe. It has been found that an important
operating parameter is the moisture content of the filter bed,
which plays an important part in determining removal efficiency.
It has also been determined that the most active microbes
in a biofilter are the heterotrophic and chemoorganotrophic
groups. Actinomycete spp. are particularly useful since they
can act on a wide variety of organic compounds and are capable
of killing pathogens under some conditions.Conventional biofilter technology using soils and
