<ABSTRACT>
An elongate tension - and pressure - absorbing construction component (11) for use in scaffolds, comprises a tension-absorbing core piece and a succession of axially impacting, sleeve-shaped sections (16) and sleeve-carrying sections (17). The sections surround and form support abutments against the core piece (15). A pair of tension means (18a, 18b) are arranged at their respective ends of the core piece (15) and form stops for the succession of sections (16, 17). The pressure-absorbing sections (16, 17) are axially set up on the tension-absorbing core piece (15) with a certain tensile force between the pair of tension means (18a, 18b).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Tension- and Pressure-Absorbing Construction ComponentsThe present invention relates to an elongate tension- and pressure-absorbing construction component, especially for use in scaffolds, framework constructions or similar building constructions.With the present invention the first and foremost aim is to produce a construction component, which can be used for various types of building purposes with the possibility, all according to the conditions, to transfer tension loads and/or pressure loads in a building con¬ struction in an accurately controlled manner. In other words in certain cases of application for example the con- struction component shall mainly transfer internal pres¬ sure forces and external pressure forces, while the con¬ struction component in other cases of application shall transfer internal tension forces and external pressure forces. By the term building construction is to be under- stood both permanent constructions, for example tent hall constructions, and readily dismantleable constructions, such as scaffolds and similar constructions.It is an objective to produce the construction compo¬ nent with th"e aid of simple means, that is to say based on individual components, which can be mounted in place in the building component in an easy, but nevertheless accu- 

rate and reliable manner, for transferring tension and pressure forces externally as well as internally 'relative to the construction component.Particularly with construction components of alu- minium and particularly construction components, where a high demand is placed on reliable and accurate connection between the components, one has to a large extent been obliged hitherto, both for strength and safety reasons, to fasten certain components in place by welding. However it is a known fact that welded aluminium constructions must in practice be designed with an over-sized large mass (large cross-sectional dimensions) in order to compensate for a weakening of the construction, as a consequence of the welding operations which must be effected in the con- struction. Extruded aluminium components have a price level which is proportional to the weight of the aluminium components.Instead of being dependent on welded constructions, it is an objective of the present invention to employ mutually pushed together and mutually coupled together components, which by the aid of simple means and in a ready manner can be assembled into a coherent construction ready for use.The construction component according to the inven- tion is

PATENT CLAIMS.
1. Elongate tension- and pressure-absorbing con- struction component (11,12,30), especially for use in scaffolds (10) , framework constructions or similar build¬ ing constructions, characterised in that the construction component (11,12,30) comprises an elongate, tension- absorbing, rigid core piece (15) , which constitutes a common support means for a succession of mutually axially impacting, sleeve-shaped, separate sections (16) and sleeve-carrying sections (17,17',17") , which separately surround the core piece (15) and which form support abut¬ ments radially against this, a pair of tension means (18a,18b; 18a'), which are arranged at their respective ends of the core piece (15) and which project laterally outwards from this, form stops for the succession of intermediate, mutually impacting sections (16,17;16,17'; 16,17"), while the impacting sections (17,17',17") are axially clamped together on the core piece (15) with a certain prestressing force between the pair of tension means (18a,18b;18a', 18a') to form a rigid coherent construction component.
2. Construction component in accordance with claim
1, characterised in that the sleeve-shaped sections (16) form spacing means between the sleeve-carrying sections (17,17',17") , which are separately adapted to transfer the load to and from the construction component (11,12,30) via the core piece (15) and the adjacent sleeve-shaped sections (16) respectively.
3. Construction component in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the core piece (15) consists of a rigid metal pipe, which is provided at opposite ends (15a) with external threads for the reception of their respective associated tension means (18a,18b;18a' ,18a' ) 


with associated internal threads for regulatable fixing of the pressure-absorbing sections (16,17;16,17,17") • between the tension means (18a, 18b;18a' , 18a' ) .
4. Construction component in accordance with claim
3, characterised in that the tension means (18a') is provided with a load-transferring mounting pin (19) for endways fastening together of a horizontal construction component (12) to a transverse, vertical construction com- ponent (11) and for transfer of loads between the con¬ struction components (11,12).
5. Construction component in accordance with one of the claims 1-4, characterised in that the sleeve-carrying section (17,17") consists of two mutually parallel sleeve portions (17a' ,17b' ;17a",17b") and an intermediate connecting piece (34) , where the two sleeve portions (17a' ,17b' ;17a",17b") are adapted to form a part of their respective pair of mutually parallel extending, elongate, force-transferring members (22,23;31,32,33) .
6. Construction component in accordance with claim 5, characterised in that the connecting piece (34) extends at an oblique angle relative to the axial direction of the sleeve portions (17a",17b") .
7. Construction component in accordance with one of the claims 1-3, characterised in that the sleeve-carrying section (17) consists of a peripheral succession of radi- ally outer, bow-shaped fastening portions (17b-17e) , which are incorporated in a radially inner sleeve portion (17a) , which surrounds and is supported in the tension-absorbing core piece (15) .
