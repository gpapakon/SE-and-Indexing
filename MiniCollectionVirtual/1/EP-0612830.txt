<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid lubricants which have 
improved oxidative stability at very high and extremely high 
temperatures. In particular, the invention provides such high 
temperature lubricants by improving the oxidative and thermal 
stability of the microencapsulated solid lubricants, having 
oxidative stability up to about 1500Â° F., which are described 
and claimed in my U.S. Patent No. 5,089,154, issued February 18, 
1992, which patent is hereby incorporated by reference. This invention provides solid lubricants, such as graphite, 
molybdenum disulfide, and graphite fluoride, which are microencapsulated 
by spray-drying from an aqueous alkali metal 
silicate system containing a water-soluble phosphate, which 
phosphate additive significantly enhances the oxidative and 
thermal properties of the lubricant. The coating and microencapsulation of various solids is 
discussed in my U.S. Patent No. 5,089,154 referenced above. U.S. 3,248,250 discloses the formation of coatings on 
substrates such as steel panels by spraying or dipping onto the 
surface of the panel an aqueous phosphate solution comprising 
solid particulate molecules, including graphite and molybdenum 
disulfide, and, as an additive, a soluble silicate. The composition 
applied to the panels is then dried and cured to water  
 
insolubility. The phosphate imparts the usual anticorrosion 
resistance and the added silicate reduces the curing temperature 
while the solid particulates which may be added, such as graphite, 
impart lubricity to the treated surface. There is no disclosure, 
however, to microencapsulation of a solid lubricant with a 
silicate to provide the high temperature lubricants of this 
invention. U.S. 3,278,328 also discloses the coating of substrates 
with inorganic polyphosphates and may include a solid such as 
graphite and molybdenum disulfide into the phosphate film which 
is said "seem to provide some structure enhancing or crosslinking 
function" and increase the durability and flexibility 
of the polymer fibers. There is no reference to the microencapsulated 
lubricants of this invention. U.S. 4,319,926 similarly discloses an aqueous coating 
composition comprised of an alkali metal silicate and a phosphate 
hardener, which composition may also include a solid 
pigment such as iron oxide, titanium oxide, carbon black and 
the like. There is no disclosure of lubricant compositions. As indicated above, this invention provides improved high 
temperature and oxidatively stable lubricants of graphite, 
graphite
