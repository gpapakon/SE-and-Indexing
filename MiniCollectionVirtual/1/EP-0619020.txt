<ABSTRACT>
Method and reagents for determining a compound of interest present in a test sample also containing one or more interfering compounds having substantially similar chemical structures, and otherwise analytically indistinguishable from each other, employing a pretreatment reagent capable of selectively modifying the chemical structure of one of the compounds without significantly modifying or altering the chemical structure of the other one of the compounds. The selective modification results in the modified compound having a chemical structure which is substantially dissimilar to the chemical structure of the other one of said compounds wherein the compounds are substantially distinguishable from each other to permit the analytical determination of one or the other of such compounds by immunoassay, high pressure liquid chromatography, and thin layer chromatography techniques, especially for the fluorescent polarization immunoassay determination of tricyclic antidepressant drugs in the presence of phenothiazines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the determination of a tricyclic
antidepressant drug which does not contain a sulfur moiety in a test sample also
containing one or more analytically interfering substances. In particular, the
present invention relates to the pretreatment of a test sample to permit the
analytical determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug which does not contain a
sulfur moiety in the presence of one or more interfering substances.The determination of analytes has become very useful in
a variety of fields such as biochemical research,
environmental and industrial testing, and especially medical
diagnostics. The monitoring of therapeutic drug levels and
other analytes in biological fluids such as serum, plasma,
whole blood, urine, and the like, has become very useful to
provide physicians with information to aid in patient
management. The monitoring of such drug levels enables
adjustment of patient dosage to achieve optimal therapeutic
effects, and helps avoid either subtherapeutic or toxic
levels. A test sample may contain one or more detectable
compounds having chemical structures which are substantially
similar to, or which resemble, or which could resemble, and
therefore be indistinguishable from, the desired analyte of
interest. For example, in the area of medical diagnostics
where it is important to monitor the level of therapeutic
drugs, a number of drugs having substantially similar
chemical structures may be administered to a patient wherein
a test sample from such patient could contain detectable
levels thereof.In such instances, the analytical determination of the
desired analyte may be interfered with by the presence of
such one or more additional substances having substantially
similar chemical structures to the chemical structure of the
analyte of interest to thereby produce inconsistent and
inaccurate results. In particular, where the analytical
determination involves immunoassay techniques employing
antibodies capable of binding to the analyte of interest,
such antibodies may also bind or crossreact with such other
substances having substantially similar chemical structures.
Similarly, where the analytical determination involves high
pressure liquid chromatography techniques or thin layer
chromatography techniques, the elution profile of the
analyte of interest may be indistinguishable from the
elution profile of such other substances having
substantially similar chemical structures. U.S. Patent No. 4,810,635 discloses a fluorescence energy transfer
immunoassay for
