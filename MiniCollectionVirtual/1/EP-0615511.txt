<ABSTRACT>
A carrier containing a plurality of layers of articles, such as beverage cans, arranged in stacked end-to-end fashion. The carrier(10) is fully enclosed and is formed with overlapping top panel flaps (16, 18) which produce an area of double thickness between handle openings in the flaps. A reinforcing sheet (40) on the underside of the top panel in the double layer area protects against tearing, while stress relief lines (34, 36) in the form of score lines extending from the ends of the handle opening to the corners of the carrier (10) provide for distribution of lifting and carrying stresses. A separator sheet (70) preventing direct contact between stacked articles extends between layers and may include distortable areas (72) aligned with the articles. Downward pressure on the upper layer (C1) causes the bottom of an article to force the distortable area into a recess in the top of the next lower article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article carrier
according to the preamble of claim 1. More particularly,
it relates to a carrier which is adapted to carry a
plurality of layers of articles in stacked end-to-end
relationship.Sleeve-type carriers are commonly used to package
beverarge cans and other types of articles, and are
typically formed from paperboard blanks which have been
folded into collapsed sleeve form. Each collapsed sleeve
is opened by a packaging machine, after which cans or
other articles are introduced through one or both of the
open ends of the sleeve and the end panel flaps are
folded and secured together. The cans are normally
introduced in upright position while the carrier sleeve
is supported on one of its side panels, with the open
ends of the sleeve facing out to recieve the cans. The
resulting carrier therefore contains a layer of cans the
ends of which are located adjacent the side panels of the
carrier. Additionally, a handle is normally incorporated
into the top panel of the carrier to facilitate lifting
and carrying.Although such carriers have been designed to
contain varying numbers of articles, conventional
packages for carrying beverage cans normally hold six or
twelve cans. This is partly because a conventional
sleeve-type carrier would be quite long when made large
enough to handle large numbers of cans, such as twenty-four,
and would be unwieldy to carry. Further, the heavy
load caused by the cans would tend to promote tearing in
the handle area. Furthermore there are known carriers capable of
holding a large number of articles which carriers are
designed to receive a plurality of layers of stacked
articles. Thus, instead of the usual single layer of
articles arranged with their ends adjacent the side
panels of the carrier, these carriers incorporate a
plurality of layers of articles, with the ends of the
articles in one layer being adjacent the ends of the
articles in the next layer. Moreover, the ends of the
articles in the end layers are adjacent the top and
bottom panels instead of the side panels. This results in
the ability to carry more articles by only slightly
increasing the overall dimensions of the carrier. A
separator sheet is provided between adjacent layers of
articles. This prior art carrier is known for example
from US-A 3351264 and US-A 4712676. The separator sheet
of the carrier disclosed in US-A 3351264 comprises
recesses receiving the bottom portion of the respective
upper article end being received by the recessed top of
the respective lower article.It

<CLAIMS>
An article carrier (10) containing a plurality of
layers of stacked articles (C1, C2) comprising:


a bottom panel (38) upon which the lowermost of
said layer of stacked articles rests;
a top panel (14) positioned above the uppermost of
said layers of stacked articles;
a pair of opposed side panels (12), integrally
connected to and extending between said bottom

panel (38) and said top panel (14), said side
panels (12) enclosing two sides of said layers of

stacked articles;
a pair of opposed end panels (20) extending between
said bottom panel (38) and said top panel (14)

substantially perpendicular to said side panels
(12) and connected to said bottom (38) and top (14)

panels to thereby complete the enclosure of said
layers of stacked articles;
a separator sheet (70) between adjacent layers of
articles (C1, C2), the separator sheet being

generally disposed in a primary plane generally
parallel to said bottom (38) and top (14) panels;
the articles (C1, C2) in each layer having top and
bottom ends contacting portions of the separator

sheet (70), the articles in each layer being
aligned in end-to-end relationship with the

articles in the adjacent layer, the bottom ends of
the articles adjacent the separator being narrower

than the top ends of the articles in the adjacent
layer, said top ends of the articles being

recessed; and
the portions (72) of the separator sheet (70)
contacted by the bottom ends of articles being

below the primary plane of the separator sheet
(70), the bottom ends of the adjacent articles and 

the portions of the separator sheet extending into
the recess,

characterized in that
those portions of the separator sheet (70)
extending into the recesses include transverse

panel portions (83) connected to the separator
sheet (70) by a first fold line (78) and additional

panel portions (85) connected to the transverse
panel portions by a second fold line (80) wherein

slits (84) extend inwardly from the first fold line
(78) to divide the transverse panel portions (83)

and the additional panel portions (85) into
segments.
The article carrier of claim 1, wherein the carrier
contains two layers o
f stacked articles.
The article carrier of claim 1, wherein the
separator sheet (70) includes an end flap (74)

extending transversely of the sheet (70) and
engaging an interior face of an end panel (20).
The article carrier of claim 1, wherein the
articles have circular peripheries and the first

fold line (78) is circular.
The article carrier of claim 4, wherein the
articles are beverage cans.
The article carrier of claim 1, including a cutout
(82) centrally located in the additional panel

portions (85).
The article carrier of claim 6, wherein the slits
(84) terminate short of the cutout (82).
