<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to an osmotic device for delivering a 
beneficial agent into the oral cavity of a patient. More 
particularly, the invention relates to an osmotic device comprising a 
shaped semipermeable wall surrounding a compartment containing a 
beneficial agent that is insoluble to very soluble in an aqueous 
fluid. A passageway through the wall connects the exterior of the 
device with the compartment containing the beneficial agent for 
delivering the agent from the device into the oral cavity. Osmotic devices for delivering a beneficial agent to an 
environment of use are disclosed in Theeuwes et al. United States 
Patent Nos. 3,845,770 and 3,916,899. These osmotic devices include a 
semipermeable wall that surrounds a compartment containing an agent. 
The wall is permeable to the passage of an external fluid, and 
substantially impermeable to the passage of agent. There is a 
passageway through the wall for delivering the agent from the device. 
These devices release agent by fluid being imbibed through the wall 
into the compartment at a rate determined by the permeability of the 
wall and the osmotic pressure gradient across the wall to produce an 
aqueous solution containing agent that is dispensed through the 
passageway from the device. These devices are extraordinarily 
effective for delivering an agent that is soluble in the fluid and 
exhibits an osmotic pressure gradient across the wall against the 
fluid, and for delivering an agent that has limited solubility in the 
fluid and is admixed with an osmotically effective compound that is 
soluble in the fluid and exhibits an osmotic pressure gradient across 
the wall against the fluid. Devices of this type can be swallowed in 
order to deliver the agent throughout the transit of the device 
through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Alternatively, devices of 
his type can be implanted to deliver a drug or other beneficial agent 
to the body. In U.S. Patent No. 4,111,202, the delivery kinetics of the 
device are enhanced by manufacturing the device with an agent  
 
compartment and an osmagent compartment separated by a film, which 
film is movable from a rested to an expanded state. The device 
delivers agent by fluid being imbibed through the wall into the 
osmagent compartment producing a solution that causes the compartment 
to increase in volume and act as a driving force that is applied 
against the film. This force urges the film to expand against the 
agent compartment and correspondingly diminish the volume of this 
compartm

<CLAIMS>
An osmotic device for the controlled delivery of a 
beneficial agent to an oral cavity of an animal over an extended 

delivery period, the device having a size and shape suitable for 
comfortably retaining the device in the oral cavity for the extended 

delivery period, the device including a wall surrounding a solid dose 
of the beneficial agent, the beneficial agent exhibiting at least 

some degree solubility in an aqueous fluid present in the oral 
cavity, and a fibrous support material having a nominal length of at 

least 5 µm (microns) comprising cellulose fibers, microcrystalline 
cellulose fibers, cellulose ester fibers, low-substituted 

hydroxypropyl cellulose fibers, chitin fibers, chitosan fibers, and 
blends thereof, the fibrous support material providing sufficient 

support to impart a buckling pressure of at least 100 mm Hg to the
