<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit for a motor driving a fan for 
inducing a draft in the exhaust of a heating, ventilating 

and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The control circuit 
may be used in conjunction with either a variable pressure 

sensor or one or two discrete pressure sensors. A 
controller receives information defining the pressure set 

point. The information may be from a switched register or 
low or high pressure input signals. The motor 

speed/torque is increased until the pressure set point is 
reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to draft inducers
and, in particular, a control for a fan driven motor for
inducing a draft in an exhaust.In a conventional furnace, the exhaust gases
from the combustion chamber are carried away by natural
convection currents. However, the resultant loss of
heat energy in the exhaust gases decreases the overall
efficiency of the furnace. In order to improve the
efficiency, heat exchangers have been used to extract
additional heat from the exhaust gases prior to the time
they are vented to the atmosphere. This cools the
exhaust gases which reduces the natural convection
currents which would otherwise carry the gases away.
One solution has been to use a draft inducing fan to
exhaust the exhaust gases into the atmosphere.Prior designs for a draft inducer control
system for controlling the exhaust of a furnace have
included a pressure transducer located in the venting
adjacent the combustion chamber, a speed sensor for the
motor, and a torque sensor for the motor. These
components have been used to vary the induced draft as a
function of the sensed pressure in the combustion
chamber. Such a control system is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,075,608 to David M. Erdman, for example.GB-A-2,238,885 discloses an air conditioning
and heating system in which a motor drive fan is
controlled for inducing a draft through a duct. The air
volume produced by the fan can be adjusted so as to
obtain a predetermined set pressure.While such systems represent an improvement,
further improvements in draft inducer control systems,
draft inducer apparatus, and methods of control and 
operation can beneficially increase the efficiency of a
furnace. For example, improvements which allow the
speed/torque of the motor and the magnitude of the
induced draft to be preselected for given operating
conditions of the furnace would increase efficiency by
more closely matching the induced draft to the
requirements of the furnace. Improvements which allow
the preselecting to occur quickly and economically
during manufacture or installation of the furnace would
also be desirable. Greater versatility of the draft
inducer control system in responding to various control
signal conditions would also be desirable.Among the objects of the invention are to
provide an improved draft inducer control system, an
improved draft inducer apparatus and improved methods of
control and operation which overcome at least some of the
disadvantageous conditions described above, an improved
draft inducer apparatus and improved
