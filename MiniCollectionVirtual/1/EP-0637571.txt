<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ceramic component with a corrosion-resistant ceramic coating on its outer surface. The coating contains from 40 to 95 % by weight of porcelain glaze, from 5 to 30 % by weight of highly sintering-active calcined clay, from 0 to 35 % by weight of unfired special porcelain and from 0 to 25 % by weight of fired special porcelain. The model component is suitable for use as a handle for chemical engineering or for cooking utensils, pots and pans or as a dip mould for the production of thin-walled rubber products by dipping the dip mould into a latex liquid.
