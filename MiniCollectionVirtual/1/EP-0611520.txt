<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutting device for lawnmowers, consisting of a rotating carrier (1), on which at least two cutters (3) are arranged pivotably, so that, when they strike an obstacle, they pivot back and subsequently resume the radial working position by centrifugal force. To limit the pivoting-back movement of the cutters, the carrier has specific stops (5a, 5b) which match with corresponding counterfaces (3b) of the cutters.
