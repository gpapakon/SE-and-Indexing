<ABSTRACT>
A Lower Leg Walker (10) for the treatment of ankle fractures and 
a variety of other injuries 

to the foot and ankle, has a foot platform base (12) comprising a 
rigid chassis (14) of more or 

less parallelepiped shape. The chassis is substantially a plurality of 
ribs disposed at 

right angles, forming a grid and is over-moulded with resilient 
materials forming a shoe 

shape. The foot platform base supports and accommodates the human foot 
and has a 

distinctive, low. double rocker profile (22,24) on its underside. The 
lower leg walker is 

provided with attachment means (16) for securing a pair of upright 
side-members (28,29) to the 

foot platform base and these are covered with Velcro® type material 
which releasably 

secures them to a wrap which is lined with terry material and encloses 
the foot, ankle 

and lower leg. The device is secured to the patient with a series of 
straps.

<DESCRIPTION>
Lower leg walkers are a class of off-the-shelf ankle foot orthosis developed in the USA 
early in the nineteen-eighties. An ankle foot orthosis is a device fitted to the ankle and 
foot to provide at least a partial substitute for some of the functions of the ankle joint. 
In the case of lower leg walkers, the main application is in assisting the ligamentous 
structures of the joint to resist inversion and eversion and in some cases to immobilise 
the joint. Lower leg walkers have a foot platform and extend proximally about the ankle and 
lower leg, normally ending a short distance below the knee. Their structural 
antecedents are below knee plaster casts and traditional orthoses, such as those used 
for the victims of poliomyelitis and cerebral palsy. The main aim of those orthoses is 
to help patients with walking difficulties to walk more easily. It remains common 
practice to build orthoses which combine a double acting or other ankle hinge with a 
foot platform, often one having a rocker sole, in order to limit ankle travel and 
facilitate ambulation. Indications for lower leg walkers have been extended by orthopaedic surgeons and 
orthotists. In the U.S.A. most seem to agree that they are indicated in non-displaced 
ankle fractures, march fractures, severe sprains and post-operative use following 
certain ankle ligament reconstructive procedures. Polakoff et al. Orthopedics November 1984 Vol 7/No 11; 1712-1715, trialling an early 
lower leg walker. stated that ``...the treatment of stable ankle fractures with an ankle 
foot orthosis (of the lower leg walker type) can significantly decrease the time until 
clinical union and the complication of ``fracture disease'' associated with plaster 
immobilisation. Specifically, posttreatment tenderness, edema, and atrophy were 
diminished, while range of motion was maintained." They go on to say future 
investigations should explore other types of ankle injuries and surgically stabilised 
conditions using orthoses of this type. Only a small number of workers has actually published in this field. In 1989, Neumann 
et al reported significantly less muscle wastage and joint stiffness in healthy volunteers 
wearing lower leg walkers than in a comparable group in short leg casts. They also 
refer to 48 cases of injured lower limbs treated in lower leg walkers including foot, 
lower tibia and fibula injuries as well as ankles. A somewhat different orthosis was 
investigated earlier by Stover and York whose 164 cases included numerous fractures 
of tibia and

<CLAIMS>
An ankle foot orthosis of the type known as a lower leg walker and comprising: 
   a foot platform base comprising; 

      a substantially rigid chassis constructed as an open grid structure of the 
form of a modified right prism or parallelepiped in particular having no 

entire upper or lower bounding wall and having side-walls which bound 
a first series of ribs disposed in a longitudinal manner and a second 

series of ribs disposed in a transverse manner and substantially enclosed 
within 

      an over-mould formed in a resilient material to produce a shoe shape 
for supportively accommodating a human foot and incorporating an 

integral sole for contact with the ground said sole being provided with a 
first longitudinally curved profile extending over the forward part of 

said integral sole and a second longitudinally curved profile extending 
over the rear part of said sole; 

      said second longitudinally curved profile providing progressive rolling 
contact with the ground during that part of the ambulatory cycle of 

movement or 'gait cycle' known as 'heel strike' and; 
      said first longitudinally curved profile providing rolling contact with 

ground during that part of the ambulatory cycle of movement or 'gait 
cycle' known as `toe off'; 

      said sole thereby providing first and second zones of contact with the 
ground such that the upper surface of said foot platform base is 

substantially level when a human Patient secured to it, stands still in that 
part of the ambulatory or `gait cycle' known as `mid-stance' and; 

   attachment means for securing a pair of; 
   upright side-members disposed laterally and medially with respect to said foot 

platform base; and; 
   securing means for releasably securing said upright side-members to; 

   wrap means for enclosing a human foot, ankle and lower leg and; 
   strap means for securing said orthosis to a human foot, ankle and lower leg. 
Apparatus according to Claims 1, wherein a chassis is formed in plastics. 
Apparatus according to Claims 1, wherein a chassis is formed in fibre reinforced 
resins. 
The chassis of Claims 1 to 3, wherein ribs have a cross-section which substantially 
resembles an inverted capital letter 'T'. 
The sole of Claim 1, wherein first and second substantially longitudinally curved 
profiles are provided with transverse corrugations or grooves. 
The apparatus of Claims 1 to 4, wherein an over-mould formed in resilient materials 
is provided with a series of invaginations disposed symmetrically within and about 

segments defined by ribs. 
Apparatus according to Claims 1 to 4 and 6, wherein a resilient over-mould is 
shaped substantially like a shoe and is extended upwards around the periphery to form 

a side-wall or upper, said upper having a thin wall section relative to the body of said 
over-mould and extending from a point near the broadest part of said over-mould on a 

first side to a corresponding point on a second side, said upper being lowest at its 
points of origin and highest around the heel. 
Apparatus according to Claims 1 to 7, wherein are provided wrap and pad means 
for releasably enclosing the lower leg, foot and ankle of a Patient within a lower leg 

walker, all of said wraps and pads being cut from open cell foamed plastics sheets 
faced on the inside or skin-facing side, with terry material and on the outside with 

brushed nylon pile fabric material for releasably securing to releasable attachment 
means, secured non-releasably to the inward facing surfaces of upright side-members 

of the said lower leg walker. 
Apparatus according to Claim 8. wherein straps are provided with closure pieces at 
one end known as tabs, each tab being formed from hook closure fabric of the type 

known commercially as Velcro® and being releasably affixed with a dot or circle of 
loop Velcro® type closure fabric, said dot or circle extending over a relatively small 

proportion of the total surface area of the tab rendering it easy to lift, whilst still 
retaining a full closing capability. 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, wherein attachment means between a foot 
platform base and medial and lateral upright side-members are each adapted to receive 

single pivot means constituting hinging means in the form of a hinge body provided 
with adjustment means comprising first posteriorly directed screw adjustment means 

above the pivot axis providing continuous variation of the limit of plantarflex travel 
and second posteriorly directed screw adjustment means below the pivot axis for 

continuous variation of the limit of dorsiflex travel said medial and lateral upright side-members 
each providing a first abutment stop above and to the rear of the pivot means 

and a second abutment stop to the rear and below the pivot means.
