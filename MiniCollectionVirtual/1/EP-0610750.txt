<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the coating of polar film substrates with a coating system which comprises a plurality of components, the single application of material leading to a multilayer structure of the coating applied. The coating system is preferably aqueous and free from organic halogen compounds and leads to an improved barrier effect of the films with respect to water vapour.

<CLAIMS>
Aqueous coating for polar films consisting of two or
more components and containing no organohalogens

applied by a single application operation, which
coating gives rise to the formation of a multilayer

structure, characterised in that the difference in
surface tensions (to DIN 53914) between the optionally

pretreated substrate to be coated and the coating in
the form in which it is applied is at least 10 mN/m,

preferably at least 20 mN/m and that the coating
consists of a wax component and a copolymeric binder,

which is synthesised from at least two of the
following monomers: acrylates, methacrylates, vinyl

acetate, vinyl alcohol, ethylene, propylene,
butadiene, styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid,

acrylamide and acrylonitrile, wherein the difference
in surface tensions of the two constituents in the

form in which they are applied is at least 5 mN/m,
preferably at least 10 mN/m, wherein the coating

contains no inorganic particles.
Coating according to claim 1, characterised in that
the wax melts at between 50°C and 120°C, preferably

between 60 and 90°C.
Coating according to claim 2, characterised in that
the wax is a paraffin wax.
Coating according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the wax content is 3 to 50%,

preferably 5 to 20% (relative to the copolymer).
Polar films having a coating according to one of
claims 1 to 4. 
Use of films according to claim 5 for the production
of packages impermeable to water vapour.
