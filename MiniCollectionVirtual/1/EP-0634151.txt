<ABSTRACT>
An electric toothbrush comprising a executive device (100) and a charge 
device (200) is operative to provide an accurate determination and an adequate 

indication of the duty performance of toothbrushing. The executive device (100) 
comprises a supply unit (110), a control unit (120) and a driving means (130). The 

control unit (120) is provided with a time-measuring means (121) for measuring the 
duty time during toothbrushing, a pressure-measuring means (122) for measuring the 

duty pressure during toothbrushing, a position-determining means (124) for determining 
the duty position during toothbrushing and a computing means (123) to compute a duty 

performance. An accurate determination of the duty performance is achieved in 
computing means (123) which computes the duty performance in response of the duty 

time, the duty pressure and the duty position. The duty performance and optionally the 
duty time, duty pressure and duty position are indicated by indication means (210) 

located either on the executive device (100) or on the charge device (200). In case of a 
detachable executive device (100), the control unit (120) in the executive device (100) 

and the indication means (210) in the charge device (200) may communicate via a 
wireless communication link.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric toothbrush comprising a
control unit comprising a time-measuring means for measuring the duty time during
toothbrushing and a pressure-measuring means for measuring the duty pressure during
toothbrushing, a driving means, which is electrically coupled to the control unit, the
driving means comprising an electro-mechanical means for driving a brush, and an
indication means, which is driven by the control unit for informing an user of the
electric toothbrush.An aforesaid toothbrush can be used to clean the teeth of an human being
to protect the teeth from caries and gingivitis (tooth decay).An aforesaid toothbrush is known inter alia from United States Patent No.
4,450,599. In that Patent the main cause of caries and gingivitis is acknowledged to be
a lasting formation of dental plaque and an adequate removal of dental plaque is
mentioned to be the desired performance of toothbrushing. In order to achieve an
adequate removal of dental plaque a duty time above a minimum time and a duty
pressure between a minimum and a maximum pressure are acknowledged to be desired.
As a consequence the control means of the known toothbrush is provided with the time-measuring
means and the pressure-measuring means to determine the duty time and the
duty pressure as well as to drive the indication means to inform the user of the duty
performance, i.e. the achieved removal of dental plaque. In the known toothbrush, to
determine the minimum time and the desired pressure, the time-measuring means is
only activated, when the pressure-measuring means determines a duty pressure between
the minimum and the maximum pressure, and the indication means is only activated,
when the time measuring-means determines a duty time exceeding the minimum time.
However, notwithstanding the design and the construction of the known toothbrush, the
achieved removal of dental plaque, when the indication means being activated, and the
disclosed display of the duty performance are found to be inaccurate.As a consequence, the present invention has the object to provide an
electric toothbrush, which provides an accurate determination and an adequate indication 
of the duty performance.An electric toothbrush in accordance with the invention is characterised in
that the control unit further comprises a computing means for
continuously
computing a duty
performance from the duty time and the duty pressure, the time-measuring
means and
the pressure-measuring means driving the computing means and the computing
