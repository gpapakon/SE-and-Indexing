<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a process for
inhibiting corrosion in refining operations. It is specifically
directed toward the inhibition of corrosion caused by naphthenic
acids and sulfur compounds which are present in the crude oil.Corrosion problems in petroleum refining operations
associated with naphthenic acid constituents in crude oils have
been recognized for many years. Such corrosion is particularly
severe in atmospheric and vacuum distillation units at temperatures
between 204°C (400°F) and 421°C (790°F). Other factors that contribute
to the corrosivity of crudes containing naphthenic acids
include the amount of naphthenic acid present, the concentration
of sulfur compounds, the velocity and turbulence of the flow stream
in the units, and the location in the unit (e.g., liquid vapor
interface). In the distillation refining of crude oils, the crude oil
is passed successively through a furnace, and one or more fractionators
such as an atmospheric tower and a vacuum tower. In
most operations, naphthenic acid corrosion is not a problem at
temperatures below 204°C (400°F). Traditional nitrogen-based
filming corrosion inhibitors are not effective at these high
temperatures and the other approaches for preventing naphthenic
acid/sulfur corrosion such as neutralization present operational
problems or are not effective.It should be observed that the term "naphthenic acid"
includes mono and di basic carboxylic acids and generally constitutes
about 50 percent by weight of the total acidic components in
crude oil. Naphthenic acids may be represented by the following
formula:

where R is an alkyl or cycloalkyl and n ranges generally from 2 to 10.Many variations of this structure and molecular weight are
possible. Some practitioners include alkyl organic acids within the
class of naphthenic acids.Naphthenic acids are corrosive between the range of about
204°C (400°F) to 421°C (790°F). At the higher temperatures the naphthenic acids are in the vapor
phase and at the lower temperatures the corrosion rate is not
serious. The corrosivity of naphthenic acids appears to be
exceptionally serious in the presence of sulfide compounds, such
as hydrogen sulfur.Efforts to minimize or prevent the naphthenic acid/sulfur
corrosion have included the following approaches:
(a) blending of higher naphthenic acid content oil with
oil low in naphthenic acids;(b) neutralization and removal of naphthenic acids from
the oil; and(c) use of corrosion inhibitors.Because these approaches have not been entirely satisfactory,
the
