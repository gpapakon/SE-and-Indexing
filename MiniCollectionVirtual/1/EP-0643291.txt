<ABSTRACT>
The device for determining the pressure in the combustion space of a piston engine (1) comprises sensors (31) for measuring pressure forces and/or expansions on a component (14) driven by a piston (12) of the engine (1). Using the pressure forces exerted and measured in the direction of the piston movement on the component (14) of the engine (1) driven by the piston (12), conclusions are drawn as to the pressure forces in the combustion space. The electrical measured value signals serve as a basis for the calculation of these pressures in the combustion space (10). Advantageously, measurements are also made of the accelerations (32) of the engine part (14) on which the force or pressure measurements are carried out. Hence it is possible to include the inertial forces and mass forces in the determination of the cylinder pressure, which permits the simple and reliable determination of the cylinder pressure over the entire rotational angle range of the crankshaft (17). Using the acceleration signal, the top-dead-centre point (TDC) and the bottom-dead-centre point (BDC) of each cylinder (11) can be determined very accurately, which is of great importance for the further signal evaluation.

Apparatus for the determination of the pressure in the
combustion chamber of a reciprocating piston engine (1),

characterised by means for the measurement of compression
force and/or tension force (31) at a component of the engine

(1) driven by the piston (12) and for the determination of
the pressure values in the combustion chamber (10) on the
