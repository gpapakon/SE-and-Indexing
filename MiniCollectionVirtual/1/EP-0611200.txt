<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a valve body (6) mounted in a sealed manner through the wall (2) of an enclosure (3) and a closure piece (7) received in the said body, and means (4) for selectively coupling the said enclosure (3) to a pipeline (5) in a sealed manner when the said closure element is in an open position. The coupling means (4) comprise a removable sleeve (18) designed to be fixed externally in a sealed manner to the said body (6) and a member (23, 31) for actuating the said closure member (7), mounted so that it can rotate in the said sleeve (18) in order to move the said closure member in the said sleeve between a closed position and the said open position in which the said enclosure (3) communicates with the said pipeline (5) by means of the said body (6) and of the said sleeve (18).

A device for seal-tight closure and connection of
a chamber (3) to an external pipe system (5) comprising

a valve body (6) mounted in seal-tight manner through a
hole in a wall (2) of the chamber (3) and also

comprising a shutter (7) received in the body (6) and
means for selectively and sealingly connecting the

chamber (3) to the pipe system (5) with the shutter (7)
in an open position, the connecting means (4)

comprising a movable sleeve (18) adapted to be
externally and sealingly secured to the body (6),

characterised in that the valve body (6) comprises a
ring (8) having an annular collar (9) at one end for

bearing against the inner surface of the wall (2) at
the periphery of the hole and also comprises a nut (10)

having an external diameter substantially equal to that
of the collar (9) and screwed to the ring (8), the

length of the threaded part of the ring (8) being
substantially greater than the combined thickness of

the wall (2) and the nut (10), the shutter (7) has a
head (12) bearing an externally threaded cylindrical

part (13) and received in a threaded bore in the valve
body (6), the cylindrical part (13), starting from its

end remote from the head (12), has an axial bore (14)
communicating with a transverse orifice (15) formed

near the head (12) and connected to the outer pipe
system (5), and the connecting means also comprise a

means (23, 31) for actuating the shutter (7) and
mounted for rotating and sliding in the sleeve (18) in

order to move the shutter in the sleeve between a
closed position in which the head (12) of the shutter

(7) is in contact with the end (12) of the ring (8) 
remote from the collar (9) and the cylindrical part

(13) is inserted into the chamber (3), and an open
position in which the chamber (3) communicates with the

pipe system (5) via the body (6) and the sleeve (18).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the head (12) and the actuating means (23, 31)

comprise complementary coupling means (17, 28) for
rotating the shutter (7) via the means (23, 31).
A device according to calim 2, characterised in
that the complementary coupling means comprise an

indentation (17) and a projection (28) of complementary
shape and size, one being formed in the head (12) and

the other at an end (24) of the drive means (23,31).
A device according to claim 3, characterised in
that the projection (28) is borne by a movable

cylindrical component (27) screwed into the end (24) of
the actuating means.
A device according to claim 4, characterised in
that the sleeve (18) has a lateral socket (20) for

connecting to the pipe system (5) and adapted to be
substantially aligned with the transverse orifice (15)

in the open position of the shutter (7).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the sleeve (18) and the actuating means (23,31)

comprise complementary abutment means (21a, 25; 21b,
32) which define the closed and open position

respectively of the shutter (7). 
A device according to claim 6, characterised in
that the complementary abutment means comprise a fixed

annular component (22) inside the sleeve (18) and
having opposite flat surfaces (21a, 21b) co-operating

with two respective shoulders (25,32) of the actuating
means.
A device according to any of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the body (6) comprises an

externally threaded ring (8) and an annular nut (10)
adapted between them to clamp the edges of hole for

fitting the body in the wall (2).
A device according to claim 8, characterised in
that the sleeve (18) has a threaded end (19) for

screwing on to the ring (8) for sealingly securing the
connecting means (4) to the body (56).
