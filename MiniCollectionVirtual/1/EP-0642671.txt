<ABSTRACT>
A probe for measuring ground resistivity is connected to a measuring device capable of generating a constant d.c. signal across two electric wires. It comprises a short-circuit; a two-way bipolar switch with two fixed contacts and two moving contacts which can be connected either to the electric wires or to the short-circuit connection respectively; and two electrodes each connected to a fixed contact, the conductive surfaces of the electrodes being positioned essentially to face each other when said electrodes are placed in the ground. In the standby position, the moving contacts are connected to the short-circuit connection. In the operating position when a measurement is to be made, the moving contacts are connected to the electric wires of the measuring device. When ground resistivity is to be measured, said moving contacts are switched from said standby position to said operating position so that the d.c. signal can be injected into the electrodes to generate a voltage across the wires representative of ground resistivity between said electrodes.
