<ABSTRACT>
Sealing device including an element (2) for fastening to the frame or body of a motor vehicle and a tubular element (5) with which a moving part of the vehicle, such as a door for example, can interact. The tubular element (5) includes an outer casing (11), a central core (12) coaxial with the said casing (11), and a plurality of connection membranes (13) which each extend between the outer periphery of the central core (12) and the inner periphery of the casing (11) of the tubular element (5). Such a sealing device makes it possible to improve the aestheticness of the tubular element (5) and contributes to improving acoustic insulation.
