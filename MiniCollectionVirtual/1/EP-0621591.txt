<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical recording
medium on which information is recorded with phase-pits, and
a device for reproducing information from the optical
recording medium. More particularly, this invention relates
to an optical recording medium which records thereon
information a with space frequency higher than a general space
frequency which is specified by wavelength of a read-out light
and numerical aperture of an objective lens, and a device for
reproducing information from the optical recording medium.As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, in order to reproduce
information from an optical disc such as a CD (Compact Disc),
an LD (Laser Disc) or the like, a read-out laser light is
irradiated to pits P (phase pits) to detect reduction in
quantity of reflected light which occurs due to diffraction,
scattering or variation of optical constant of the pit, whereby
information corresponding to presence or absence of the pits
is obtained. More specifically, when the spot of the read-out
laser light is irradiated onto the pit, as shown in FIG. 1A,
the quantity of return light which is reflected due to
scattering or the like is small. On the other hand, when the
spot of the read-out laser light is irradiated in a gap between 
pits, i.e., off the pit as shown in Fig. 1B, the quantity
of the return light is large. Information recorded on the
optical disc is read out using the difference in quantity
of the return light as described above.In such cases, a reproduction resolution of the
optical disc is restricted by the wavelength 位 of the read-out
laser light and the numerical aperture NA, and thereof
information having space frequency higher than the space
frequency fc = 2NA/位 cannot be reproduced.EP-A-0525191 discloses a recording medium and
reproducing apparatus with information recorded as phase
pits.The phase pits are previously formed on a transparent substrate
and covered by a phase change material having its reflectance change with temperature. By
using the temperature distribution in the reading spot the reflection is
partly changed within the spot allowing the read-out of pits with a diameter of half or less the
spot diameter while masking the rest of the spot. An object of this invention is to provide an optical
recording medium capable of recording information with a
space frequency higher than the space frequency fc = 2NA/位,
specified by the wavelength 位 of a read-out laser light and
the numerical aperture NA of an objective lens, and a
device for reproducing information from the optical
recording
