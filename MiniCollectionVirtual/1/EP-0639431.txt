<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an assembly for supporting at least one forearm during the operation of keyboards, during assembly work or the like, comprising at least one lever which can be fixed to a table- or worktop and is connected via at least one lockable joint with a pivotable carrier for receiving a support plate, the joint having two endpieces which can be braced with respect to each other and between which are arranged a plurality of lamellae secured alternately to different joint arms so as to be fixed in terms of rotation. In order that the previous fixing process of the lamellae assigned to the fixing bow and the support plate can be dispensed with and the lamellae, or their functioning, are no longer impaired by dust from dirt and in order to improve the visual impression, the carrier (6) and the lever (1) have at least one pin (7) located on the joint axis and intended for receiving the lamellae (8), every second lamella (8a) is secured so as to be fixed in terms of rotation on the pin (7), the pin (7) reaches together with all of the lamellae (8) into a recess (9) of one endpiece (10) and in the recess (9) the other lamellae (8b) are secured against rotation.
