<ABSTRACT>
Process for extracting malodorous compounds present in a liquid formulation containing at least one compound carrying a thiol functional group of formula: HS-A-Y-B (I) in which the said formulation is brought into contact with a pulverulent absorbing agent in order to obtain a deodorised composition intended for a subsequent use, the said absorbing agent being such that, when it is suspended in an aqueous solution containing 92 g/l of thioglycolic acid, the said aqueous solution still contains at least 30% by weight of the initial thioglycolic acid after contact for 15 minutes.

charcterized in that the said formulation is placed in
contact with a pulverulent absorbing agent, in order to

obtain a deodourized composition, intended for a 
subsequent use, the said absorbing agent being such that,

when it is suspended in an aqueous solution containing
92 g/l of thioglycolic acid, the said aqueous solution

also contains at least 30% by weight of the initial
thioglycolic acid after contact for 15 minutes.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the compounds of formula (I) are chosen from the

group formed by thioglycolic acid, thiolactic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic

that the formulation is placed in contact with the

absorbing agent between 5 minutes and 30 minutes before
use of the composition.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the liquid formulation is passed

through a layer of absorbing agent.

head hair and body hair, characterized in that it
contains at least one compound of formula (I) as defined 

in Claim 1 and at least one pulverulent absorbing agent
as defined in Claim 1.
Composition according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the compound(s) of formula (I) is

(are) present at a concentration between 2 and 30% by
weight relative to the total weight of the composition

and the absorbing agent at a concentration between 0.5
and 30% by weight relative to the total weight of the

composition.
Composition according to Claim 10,
characterized in that the compound(s) of formula (I) is

(are) present therein at a concentration between 5 and
25% by weight relative to the total weight of the

composition and the absorbing agent at a concentration
