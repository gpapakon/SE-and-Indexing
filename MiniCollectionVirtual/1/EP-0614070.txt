<ABSTRACT>
An electronic pedometer with pulse counting device, which has only one 
sensor used for pulse wave counting as well as step number counting. 
Pulse wave detecting means 10 detects the pulse wave of a human body, and 
outputs the pulse wave signal detected to pulse wave calculating means 13 and 

action noise detecting means 12. Action noise detecting means 12 outputs an action 
noise signal after comparing the stored contents in the pulse wave level memory 

means 11 with the pulse wave signal received. The pulse wave calculate control 
means 14 selects various constant values stored in constant value memory means 

15, based on the action noise signal received, and the various constant values. 
Pulse wave calculating means 13 calculates the pulse wave signal received based on 

various constant values and on standard signal, and outputs the result to displaying 
means 16. 
The displaying means 16 thus receives the pulse rate from the pulse wave 
calculating means 13 and a step count from the pulse wave calculate control means 

14.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic pedometer with pulse counting device
which is equipped with a pulse counting function as well as a pedometer function.
The pulse counting device is suitable for measuring the heart rate.Fig. 4 is illustrative of a functional block diagram which shows the
operations of an electronic pedometer with a pulse counting device in accordance
with the prior art. Pulse wave detecting means 40 detects a pulse wave signal and
outputs the detected signal to an amplify wave shaping means 41. The amplify
wave shaping means 41 outputs to a pulse wave calculating means 42, a pulse wave
signal which has its waveform shaped by the amplify wave shaping means 41. The
pulse wave calculating means 42 calculates the cycle of the pulse wave signal input
thereto based on a standard signal output by a timing pulse generating means 45.
The pulse wave calculating means 42 outputs to a display selecting means 47, the
pulse wave information which has been calculated. Step number data detecting
means 43 detects a step signal and outputs to a wave shaping means 44, the step
signal which has been detected. The wave shaping means 44 shapes the wave of
the step signal which has been input and outputs to a step number data calculating
means 46, the wave-shaped step signal. The step number data calculating means 46
calculates the cycle of the step signal which has been input based on a standard
signal which is output from the timing pulse generating means 45. The step
number data calculating means outputs into the display selecting means 47 the
calculated step information. The display selecting means 47 above selects from the
pulse wave information and step number information, both of which have been
input to it, by referring to the output level which is output by a selecting switch 49,
and outputs to a displaying means 48. The displaying means 48 displays the
information which is input. Such an electronic pedometer with pulse counting device as mentioned above is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. JP-A-56-79382 (1981). In this electronic
pedometer with pulse counting device, the pulse sensor by which a pulse wave and its
number is measured and step number sensor which measures the number of steps are
equipped separately. Thus the pulse wave measuring function and the step number
measuring function can be used in the way that both functions are manually selected
alternately by the selecting switch.Increasingly, people who wish to do self health control through sporting activities,
such as
