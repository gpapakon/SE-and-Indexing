Inhibiting coke formation on heat transfer 
surfaces used to heat or cool a petroleum feedstock at 

coke-forming conditions by using phosphorothioates.

an effective amount of S,S,S-trihydrocarbyl 
phosphorotrithioate, either by pretreatment or by 

admixture of the phosphorotrithioate with the 
feedstock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an antifouling process for treating heat
transfer surfaces which heat or cool various hydrocarbon feedstocks, often in
the presence of steam, at conditions tending to promote the formation of coke
on the surfaces, and more particularly, to the use of phosphorothioates
as anti-coking agents.Ethylene manufacture entails the use of pyrolysis or cracking furnaces
to manufacture ethylene from various gaseous and liquid petroleum
feedstocks. Typical gaseous feedstocks include ethane, propane, butane
and mixtures thereof. Typical liquid feedstocks include naphthas, kerosene,
and atmospheric/vacuum gas oil. When gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon
feedstocks are pyrolyzed in the presence of steam, significant quantities of
ethylene and other useful unsaturated compounds are obtained. Steam is
used to regulate the cracking reaction of saturated feedstocks to unsaturated
products. The effluent products are quenched and fractionated in
downstream columns, and then further reacted or processed depending on
need.Fouling of cracking furnace coils, transfer line exchangers (TLEs) and
other heat transfer surfaces occurs because of coking and polymer
deposition. The fouling problem is one of the major operational limitations
experienced in running an ethylene plant. Depending on deposition rate,
ethylene furnaces must be periodically shut down for cleaning. In addition to
periodic cleaning, crash shutdowns are sometimes required because of
dangerous increases in pressure or temperatures resulting from deposit
buildup in the furnace coils and TLEs. Cleaning operations are carried out
either mechanically or by passing steam and/or air through the coils to
oxidize and burn off the coke buildup.A major limitation of ethylene furnace run length is coke formation in
the radiant section and transfer line exchangers (TLEs). The coke is
normally removed by introducing steam and/or air to the unit which in effect
burns off carbonaceous deposits. Since coke is a good thermal insulator, the
furnace firing must be gradually increased to provide enough heat transfer to
maintain the desired conversion level. Higher temperatures shorten the tube
life, and tubes are quite expensive to replace. Additionally, coke formation
decreases the effective cross-sectional area of the process gas, which
increases the pressure drop across the furnace and TLEs. Not only is 
valuable production time lost during the decoking operation, but also the
pressure buildup resulting from coke formation adversely affects ethylene
yield. Run
