<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains generally to 
devices that test integrated circuits, and more 
particularly to an improved test socket which is capable 
of making, on a repetitive basis, reliable connections 
between the integrated circuit leads and the test sockets 
contact pins. 
Test sockets for integrated circuits are known from e.g. US-A- 3771109. Critical integrated circuits are tested at 
elevated temperatures before being installed in a product 
because it has been found that a vast majority of these 
circuits, if prone to failure, will fail in a very short 
test period. These integrated circuits are frequently 
encapsulated in rectangular ceramic or plastic packages 
that have contact pads or leads, which pads or leads are 
electrically connected to the integrated circuit. To 
test the integrated circuit it is necessary to make 
temporary electrical connections to the contact pads or 
leads on the integrated circuit package. Test sockets 
which may be soldered to printed circuit boards having 
the appropriate circuitry for testing a particular 
integrated circuit have been provided for this purpose. Most prior designs include a lid which is 
either hinged to the test socket base along one edge or 
clipped to the test socket base along several edges, 
either of which is intended to clamp the integrated 
circuit down onto the contact pins of the test socket as 
the lid is closed. Unfortunately, during closure it has 
been found that the hinged or the clipped lid results in 
dynamic components of force being exerted in a non-normal  
 
direction. The normal direction is defined by a vector 
perpendicular to the plane of the test socket. Any 
applied force in other than the normal direction may 
result in movement of the integrated circuit relative to 
the contact pins of the test socket and damage to the 
contact pads or leads of the integrated circuit or 
cracking or breakage of the ceramic or plastic 
encapsulating the integrated circuit. The present invention compensates for non-normal 
forces caused by the cover of a test socket during 
closure by providing a test socket which includes a base 
having a generally flat lower surface and upstanding 
walls extending from the lower surface to define an open 
interior above the lower surface, a platform for 
supporting the integrated circuit and having dependent 
legs extending from the platform toward the base lower 
surface, the legs terminating in ends which project 
substantially perpendicularly to the extension of the 
legs, the base walls

<CLAIMS>
A test socket (10) for integrated circuits (40) 
comprising: 


a base (12); 
a platform (14) supporting said integrated circuit (40): 
resilient contacts (32) for electrical connection to 

said integrated circuit (40) and for supporting said platform (14) 
in spaced relationship to said base (12) and permitting 

resilient movement of said platform (14) relative to said 
base; and 
means (26,28) for retaining said platform (14) relative to 
said base (12) at a rest position and for permitting 

rotational and translational movement of said platform (14) 
toward said base from said rest position. 
A test socket according to claim 1 further 
including a cover (16) removably attached to said base (12) for 

forcing the integrated circuit (40) into contact with said 
contacts(32). 
A test socket according to claim 2 further 
including a hinge (44) for attaching said cover (16) to said base (12). 
A test socket according to claim 3 further 
including a latch (18) for retaining said cover in contact 

with said integrated circuit (40). 
A test socket according to claim 1 wherein 
said means for retaining said platform includes legs (26) 

depending from said platform (14) toward said base (12), which legs (26) 
terminate in projections (28) extending substantially 

perpendicularly to said legs, and wherein said base (12) 
further includes walls (22) interacting with said leg (28) 

projections to permit movement of said legs toward said 
base but not away from said base. 
A test socket for integrated circuits 
comprising:  

 

a base (12) having a generally flat lower surface (20) 
and upstanding walls (22) extending from said lower surface to 

define an open interior above said lower surface; 
a platform (14) for supporting the integrated 
circuit and having at least two dependent legs (26) extending 

from said platform toward said base lower surface (20), said 
legs terminating in ends (28) which project substantially 

perpendicularly to the extension of said legs; 
said base walls (22) including recesses (30) in register 
with said platform leg ends (28), which recesses engag
e said 
leg ends and prevent movement of said platform away from 

said base lower surface (20) but permit movement of any 
portion of said platform toward said base lower surface 

independently of movement of any other portion of said 
platform toward said base; 
resilient contacts (32) disposed between said base 
lower surface (20) and said platform (14) for electrical connection 

with the integrated circuit (40) on said platform (14) and for 
supporting said platform in spaced relation to said lower 

surface while permitting resilient movement of said 
platform toward said lower surface; 
A cover (16) and a hinge (44) connecting said cover to 
said base adjacent one of said base walls and permitting 

rotational movement of said cover relative to said base; 
and 
a latch (18) releasably retaining said cover (16) 
relative to said base (20) so that said integrated circuit is 

retained in contact with said resilient contacts (32).
