<ABSTRACT>
Device for dispensing a fluid product comprising a container (102) fitted with a dispensing means (103) comprising a translationally movable dispensing head (104) with a push piece (104a), and a cap (106) that fits over the container (102) and dispensing head (104), hinged to which cap is a lever (107) supporting a pressure component (109) designed to press on the push piece (104a) of the dispensing head (104) in order to depress the dispensing head (104). The pressure component (109) is of such a shape, in section in a plane of rotation of the lever (107), that a force applied to the end of the lever (107) is transmitted to a constant point (P) on the push piece of the dispensing head (104) and that, as the head (104) is depressed, the point of application (P) of the force is displaced parallel with the axis of translation (X-X) of the head (104) of the dispensing means. The pressure component (109) is in the shape more particularly of an involute of a circle (C).

Device for dispensing a fluid product, comprising 
a container (102) fitted with a dispensing member (103) 

comprising a dispensing head (104) which can be moved in 
translation and is fitted with a button (104a), and a cap 

(106) covering the container (102) and the dispensing 
head (104), on which cap a lever (107) is articulated, 

the lever carrying a bearing element (109) capable of 
bearing on the button (104a) of the dispensing head (104) 

in order to push in the dispensing head (104) of the 
dispensing member (103), characterized in that the 

bearing element is a cam whose cross-section through the 
plane of rotation of the lever (107) is bounded by an 

involute (109a) of a circle (C) centred on the axis (108) 
of articulation of the lever (107), this axis of articulation 

being located above the plane on which the 
bearing force is exerted on the button. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the circle (C) is tangent to the axis (X-X) of the 

head (104). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the circle involute (109a) is tangent to the 

button (104a) of the dispensing head (104) when the lever 
(107) is in the resting position. 
Device according to both of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the point (P) of application of the 

force is located at the centre of the button (104a) of 
the dispensing head (104), on the axis (X-X) of translation 

of the movable head (104) of the dispensing member. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the axis (108) of articulation of 

the lever (107) consists of a hinge film. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the lever (107) and the cap (106) form 

two separate parts which can be articulated to each 
other.
