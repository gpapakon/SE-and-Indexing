<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nucleic acids encoding recombinant polypeptide enzymes pertaining to the sialyltransferase gene
family, a group of glycosyltransferases responsible for the
terminal sialylation of carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins,
glycolypids and oligosaccharides which contain a conserved
region of homology in the catalytic domain. Members of the
sialyltransferase gene family comprise Galβ1,3GalNAc α2,3
sialyltransferase and Gal1,3(4)GlcNAc α2,3 sialyltransferase.
The invention further relates to nucleic acids capable of expressing novel forms and compositions
thereof and particularly providing the means and methods for the
identification and production of members of the
sialyltransferase gene family to homogeneity in significant
useful quantities. This invention thus relates to
isolated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) coding for the
production of sialyltransferases; to methods of obtaining DNA
molecules which code for sialyltransferases; to the expression
of human and mammalian sialyltransferases utilizing such DNA,
as well as to novel compounds, including novel expression vectors
having nucleic acid sequences encoding sialyltransferases or fragments thereof. This
invention is also directed to sialyltransferase derivatives,
particularly derivatives lacking cytoplasmic and/or
transmembrane portions of the protein, and their production by
recombinant DNA techniques.Sialyltransferases are a family of enzymes that
catalyze the transfer of sialic acid (SA) to terminal portions
on the carbohydrate groups of glycolipids and oligosaccharides
in the general reaction:
Cytididine 5 monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-SA) +
HO-acceptor→CMP + SA-O-Acceptor
(Beyer, T.A. et. Adv. Enzynol. 52, 23-175 [1981]). Sialyltransferases are found primarily in the Golgi
apparatus of cells where they participate in post-translational
glycosylation pathways. (Fleischer, B.J. Cell
Biol. 89, 246-255 [1981]). They are also found in body
fluids, such as breast milk, colostrum and blood. At least
10-12 different sialyltransferases are required to synthesize
all the sialyloligossacharide sequences known. Each of these
would be distinguished enzymatically by their specificity for
the sequence of the acceptor oligosaccharide and the anomeric
linkage formed between the sialic acid and the sugar to which
it is attached. Four sialyltransferases have been purified.
