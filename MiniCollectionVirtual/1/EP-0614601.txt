<ABSTRACT>
The circuit-board manufacturing method proposed calls for bores (6, 6A) to be made at points bridging the gaps (5) separating the future conductor tracks (2, 3, 4) and for the bores to be filled with adhesive. The gaps (5) between the conductor tracks (2, 3, 4) are then etched away, thus forming a conductor-track skeleton which is held together by the adhesive bridges (8). Finally, this conductor-track skeleton is attached to an insulating film (9).
