<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
manufacture of an aqueous detergent composition. The present 
invention relates more particularly to a mixing order to 
prepare such a composition comprising a substantial amount of 
organic components. Aqueous, detergent compositions have been described 
extensively in the art. More specifically it is well known 
that such compositions may be formulated as solutions 
comprising water and organic components such as surfactants, 
perfumes, stabilizers and the like. These organic components 
are predominantly poorly soluble or even insoluble in water. 
Therefore, there is a natural tendency for said compositions to 
be unclear, i.e. turbid, as said organic components may not be  
 
fully dissolved in the aqueous matrix. This becomes even more 
of a problem as the total proportion of organic components is 
increased. This phenomenon results in mitigated consumer 
acceptance. Therefore, the problem the present invention seeks 
to solve is to avoid turbidity in the compositions finally 
obtained. In response to this technical problem, applicants have 
found that by incorporating the different organic components in 
a specific order during the manufacture of such an aqueous 
detergent composition, a clear and transparent final 
composition could be obtained. It is thus an object of the present invention to obtain an 
aqueous detergent composition which is clear and transparent. Applicant's European patent application EP-A-517 996 
discloses stable hydrogen peroxide-containing bleaching 
compositions which are made by mixing together all ingredients 
except for hydrogen peroxide which is added as a final step in 
the process. Said application discloses nothing about the 
aforementioned turbidity problem. The present invention includes a process for the 
manufacture of an aqueous detergent composition comprising a 
nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant and a perfume. Said 
process includes the steps of : 
mixing said nonionic surfactant in said water 
(composition A); dissolving said perfume in said anionic surfactant 
(composition B); thereafter mixing said composition B in said 
composition A (composition C). The present invention concerns the manufacture of an 
aqueous detergent composition. Said aqueous detergent 
composition comprises water, a nonionic surfactant, an anionic 
surfactant and a perfume. The compositions according to the 
present invention can be formulated in a variety of different 
embodiments, especially household cleaners. As a
