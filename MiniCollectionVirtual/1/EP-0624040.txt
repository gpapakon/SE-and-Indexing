<ABSTRACT>
A system for composing multimedia signals from various source 
signals, such as still-frame video signals, full motion video signals and audio signals 

includes a plurality of composing units (314), each of which is capable of composing 
(in 440) a multimedia signal from selected source signals. One of such composing 

units (314) is assigned for each multimedia signal to be composed. Each composing 
unit (314) accepts parameters specifying various properties for each element of the 

multimedia signal, such as size, position and precedence for each video element and 
gain for each audio element. The composing units can include decompressors 

(418,420,422) for decompressing source signals furnished in compressed form and a 
compressor (444,446) to compress the multimedia signal to be transmitted to a user. 

The source signals can be received from a packet network and the resulting 
multimedia signals transmitted to the respective users via the same packet network.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to interactive television systems, and more 
particularly to systems for generating multimedia signals from various video and 
audio sources for transmission to users in connection with furnishing interactive 
television services. Cable television systems have made possible the transmission of many 
channels of television programs to the homes of subscribers. Instead of being limited 
to the number of VHF and UHF channels that can be transmitted and received in a 
given area, the number of channels in cable systems is limited only by the 
transmission characteristics of the cable itself and the ability to compress the 
information in television programs into narrower-bandwidth channels. The advent of 
fiber-optic transmission systems for use in cable television networks has also vastly 
increased the number of channels available. Such increase in channels has also given rise to proposals for interactive 
television systems wherein a subscriber can transmit information or requests back 
into the system, which information or requests may subsequently affect programs or 
information directed to such subscriber. There are a wide variety of applications for 
interactive television systems, such as video games, video catalog shopping, 
teaching systems, movies on demand and audio programs. Each application can be 
tailored for an individual subscriber, for example a subscriber may be able to select 
the language of the soundtrack in a movie. However, such systems typically require 
the ability (i) to control specific programs or information sent to each subscriber and 
(ii) to receive input messages or requests from the subscriber. A headend-to-subscriber channel does not need the full bandwidth of the 
usual television cable channel if compression can be used. For example if a 
television signal is digitized and compressed in accordance with the MPEG standard, 
it is possible to transmit sixteen television programs digitally over a single 
conventional 6 Mhz cable channel. Other program information, such as high-fidelity 
audio, still video pictures or text can also be sent in compressed form. By using a 
large number of conventional channels for ITV purposes, such as is now possible 
with optical fiber distribution systems, together with compression, it is conceivable 
that hundreds of virtual channels could be made available.  Systems are also becoming available for transmitting compressed and 
encoded television signals over telephone circuits. In one such system, 1.5
