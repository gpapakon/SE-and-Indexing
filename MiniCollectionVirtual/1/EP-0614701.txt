<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with the comminution of brittle grinding material, in which the grinding material is comminuted in a material-bed roller mill, scabs obtained during comminution are deagglomerated in a deagglomeration stage, and deagglomerated material is graded in a separator into at least two material fractions of differing fineness. To achieve an especially high degree of deagglomeration, an adjustable part quantity of the deagglomerated material is branched off between the deagglomeration stage and the separator and is fed to the deagglomeration stage once again.
