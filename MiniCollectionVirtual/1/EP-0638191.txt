<ABSTRACT>
A flexible closure, for use in an alarm system is provided in which a conductive sensing element is interlaced with fibre matrix material to provide a network over at least part of the closure. The interlacing is preferably by means of knitting a conductive wire together with a yarn which forms the matrix of the closure. The closure may further include a protective outer layer on one or both faces of the closure.

 A METHOD OF MAKING A FLEXIBLE CLOSURE
 INCORPORATING AN ALARM SYSTEM
 The invention relates to a method of making a flexible closure and to a flexible closure for incorporation in an alarm system.


 In my earlier publication, WO 87/06749, I have disclosed an alarm system for flexible closures consisting of a network of conductive sensing elements which are attached to or incorporated into the closure. If the closure is cut to any significant extent, the elements will be disturbed or broken causing a change in the current flowing therein or a change in the resistance. This change is used to trigger an alarm, alerting the owner to any attempted unauthorized access to the area enclosed by the flexible closure.


 In that prior arrangement, the network of conductive sensing elements is stitched, bonded or webbed to a layer of material which forms the flexible closure. It is necessary to use such a layer on which to lay down the network. In an attempt to make it more difficult to detect one of the elements of the network and subsequently attempt to by-pass the alarm system, I disclosed in my European Publication No. 0359762 an alarm system in which the conductive sensing elements comprise conductors in a common outer sheath together with at least one other dummy conductor.  


 Other prior arrangements for deterring unauthorized access include U.S. Patents Nos.


3051935 and 4293778. U.S. No. 3051935 discloses a screen structure comprising a sheet of nonconductive screen material secured in a frame with strands of conductive wire then being woven through the screen material. The wire and the screen material are preferably coated with a vinyl material so as to be visibly indistinguishable.


U.S. No. 4293778 discloses an anti-theft screen construction in which lengths of conductive wire are laid on a mesh screen and then mechanical bonded to the screen at the points of intersection. However, these prior arrangements suffer from the disadvantage that the screens are rigid, moreover all the prior arrangements suffer from the disadvantage that the conductive elements are applied to a preformed substrate.


 It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of making a flexible closure incorporating a conductive sensing element for an alarm system and to a flexible closure incorporating a conductive sensing element.


 According to the invention, there is provided a method of making a flexible closure for incorporation in an alarm system the method comprising interlacing a conductive
