<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of making conical (frustoconical) wound packages of glass threads. This method consists, downstream of a device (29) for drawing filaments (23) of glass combined into a thread (27), in causing the said thread to pass at the end of the arm (33) of a yielding (dancing) roller (32) then in coiling it on a support (38) fastened via one of its ends to a spindle (40) driven in a rotary movement and in distributing the quantity of thread deposited on the said support with the aid of a thread guide (37) moving in a to-and-fro movement parallel to the axis of the said [lacuna]
, so as to obtain a conical wound package over at least a part of its height, allocating a constant value to the rotational speed of the drawing device (29), programming the speed of displacement of the thread guide and the length of its path, permanently measuring the difference between the speed at which the thread is drawn, which is constant, and its coiling speed by virtue of the displacement of the arm of the yielding roller and slaving the rotational speed of the spindle to the difference thus measured such that, for each path of the thread guide, the said speed varies between two extreme values which decrease simultaneously from the beginning to the end of the coiling operation.

Method for manufacturing a roll of glass yarn
according to which continuous glass filaments are drawn

mechanically from a multiplicity of thin streams of molten
glass flowing from the openings of a die, then are coated

with a size and united into a yarn which is carried along
by a drawing device, and which consists, downstream of this

device, in passing the said yarn to the end of the arm of
a compensating roller and then winding it on a support

fixed by one of its ends to a spindle driven in a rotational
movement, and distributing the quantity of yarn

deposited on the said support by means of a thread guide
moving in a reciprocating motion parallel to the axis

thereof so as to obtain a frustoconical roll over at least
a part of its height, while assigning a constant value to

the rotation speed of the drawing device, programming the
speed of movement of the thread guide and the length of its

travel, continuously measuring the deviation between the
speed at which the yarn is drawn, which is constant, and

the speed at which it is wound, by means of the displacement
of the arm of the compensating roller, and controlling

the speed of rotation of the spindle according to the
deviation thus measured, in such a way that, for each pass

of the thread guide, the said speed varies between two
extreme values, decreasing simultaneously from the start to

the end of the winding operation.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the speed of rotation of the spindle is controlled, in

real time, according to the displacement of the arm carrying
the compensating roller by means of a regulator with

PID action, connected to the motor of the said spindle by
way of a frequency varying means.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the speed of rotation of the spindle is controlled

according to the displacement of the arm carrying the 
compensating roller by means of a regulator with PID

action, the regulating parameters of which are programmed
by an automatic
 device, the said regulator being connected
to the motor of the spindle by way of a frequency varying

means.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the speed of rotation of the spindle is controlled

according to the displacement of the arm of the compensating
roller, the signal of which is transmitted to an

automatic device which, after conversion and calculation in
response to the programmed parameters, transmits information

to the frequency varying means connected to the motor
of the said spindle.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the speed of rotation of the spindle is controlled for

the depositing of a layer "n", by way of a frequency
varying means, by a programmed automatic device, the said

control being corrected after comparison with the signals
transmitted to the automatic device by the arm of the

compensating roller during the depositing of the layers
n-1, n-2, ...n-p.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the yarn is carried along and wound

at a linear speed at least equal to 10 metres per second.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the speed of movement of the

thread guide, for the depositing of each layer, varies
between at least two extreme values from the start to the

end of the winding operation.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the speed of movement of the thread

guide, for each layer deposited at the start of the winding
operation, varies between at least two extreme values, the

said speed then remaining constant between the points of
return of the said thread guide for the depositing of the

following layers until the end of the winding operation. 
Method according to Claim 1 to 6, characterized
in that the speed of movement of the thread guide is

constant between the points of return of the said thread
guide from the start to the end of the winding operation.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the length of the stroke of the thread

guide decreases during at least a part of the duration of
the winding operation.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the layers of yarn are superposed on

a cylindrical support.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the layers of yarn are superposed on a

frustoconical support.
Roll of glass yarn obtained according to the
method defined by any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that it is formed of a yarn consisting of
filaments having an average diameter of between 5 and 14

micrometres.
Roll according to Claim 13, characterized in that
it is formed of a yarn coated with a size constituted

essentially by a mixture of organic products.
Roll according to either of Claims 13 and 14,
characterized in that it is wound on a cylindrical or

frustoconical support.
Roll according to Claim 15, characterized in that
the support comprises a straight or frustoconical flank at

one of its ends.
