<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a permanently removable, 
low melt viscosity acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive. In 
particular, the present invention relates to an adhesive 
comprising a lower alkyl acrylate, a higher alkyl acrylate and a 
crosslinker. Removable pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) adhered to a 
backing, which predictably adhere, yet remain repeatedly peelable 
from a variety of substrates over a long period of time without 
damaging or marring the substrate, have many commercial uses. For 
example, masking tapes, removable labels or office notes, 
protective films and medical tapes all must quickly adhere to 
metal, paper, plastics and skin, respectively, but must also peel 
smoothly away from these varied substrates without leaving behind 
any adhesive residue on or damaging the surface of a particular 
substrate. Ideally, depending on the substrate, the removable adhesive 
must provide sufficient tack (or quick stick) to quickly fix the 
adhesive to the desired substrate, adequate peel strength to 
prevent damage of the surface when the adhesive is removed, and 
have the appropriate cohesive strength to control the transfer of 
adhesive to the substrate. Cohesive strength must also be 
controlled so to limit the cold flow of the adhesive on a surface, 
a process which leads to an undesirable building of peel strength 
over time. Balancing these pressure sensitive adhesive 
properties, particularly in a removable adhesive, poses 
difficulties to the formulator. U.S. Patent No. 3,691,140 (Silver) discloses the use of 
solid, inherently tacky, pressure-sensitive adhesive microspheres 
which, when adhered to a first substrate, may when contacted to a 
second substrate be easily removed from the second substrate 
without delaminating the first substrate or the second substrate. 
While exhibiting a high degree of removability, microsphere 
adhesives tend to transfer to contact surfaces such the second 
substrate. U.S. Patent No. 5,045,569 (Delgado) discloses hollow, 
inherently tacky pressure-sensitive adhesive acrylate microspheres 
which, due to their unique morphology, provide enhanced peel and 
shear strength and less adhesive transfer to substrates than 
"repositionable" adhesives based on solid acrylate-based  
 
microspheres. Although hollow microsphere adhesives show less 
adhesive transfer to substrates, they still have less than an 
optimum degree of adhesive transfer. In contrast, U.S. Patent No. 4,599,265 (Esmay) discloses an 
adhesive having a high degree of cohesive
