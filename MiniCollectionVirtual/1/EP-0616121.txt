<ABSTRACT>
Functionality of the exhaust gas oxygen sensor is 
determined by continually monitoring the exhaust gas oxygen 

sensor voltage to determine both a peak rich voltage and 
peak lean voltage. Based on the information after some 

predetermined time period, a system determines whether rich 
air/fuel ratio excursions are required and lean air/fuel 

ratio excursions are required. If a rich air/fuel excursion 
is required, then there is a command to decrease the 

air/fuel ratio to make it rich until the peak rich voltage 
is greater than a predetermined threshold voltage. 

Analogously, if a lean excursion is required, then there is 
a command to have a lean air/fuel ratio excursion done until 

the peak lean voltage is less than a predetermined 
threshold. If a time out happened before the peak rich 

voltage was greater than the rich threshold or the peak lean 
voltage was less than the lean threshold, then there is a 

determination that there is a malfunction detected on the 
sensor/circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to onboard monitoring of 
emission control components in an automobile vehicle having 
an internal combustion engine. It is known to use catalysts in the exhaust stream of 
an automobile in order to reduce undesired components of the 
exhaust. It is also known to monitor whether the catalyst 
is operating properly. One way of doing this is to have 
exhaust gas oxygen sensors both upstream and downstream of 
the catalyst. The output signals from these two sensors are 
compared to make a determination about the operation of the 
catalyst located between the two exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) 
sensors. However, such a method assumes proper operation of 
the EGO sensors. It is known that the EGO sensor can be removed from the 
vehicle and tested in a laboratory to determine proper 
operation. However, this is not a practical method, and it 
would be desirable to have a method whereby the EGO sensor 
can be tested while still installed on the vehicle. These 
are some of the problems this invention overcomes. This invention teaches a non-intrusive approach to 
determining the functionality of an EGO sensor, located down 
stream of the catalyst, which is also known as a catalyst 
monitor sensor (CMS). In accordance with an embodiment of 
this invention, the functionality of the CMS can be 
determined in a non-intrusive way. Further, for a new 
catalyst with very high oxygen storage capacity, i.e. a 
green catalyst, this invention provides a method including 
additional steps of intrusive monitoring of the CMS. In particular, in accordance with an embodiment of this 
invention it is possible to provide a measure of the 
functionality of the CMS without affecting a vehicle 
emission test or producing an unwanted indication of 
malfunction during green catalyst operation. Functionality of the exhaust gas oxygen sensor is 
determined by continually monitoring the exhaust gas oxygen 
sensor voltage to determine both a peak rich voltage and  
 
peak lean voltage. The system also determines whether rich 
air/fuel ratio excursions are required and/or lean air/fuel 
ratio excursions are required based on the peak rich/lean 
voltages recorded over a predetermined period of time. If a 
rich air/fuel excursion is required then there is a command 
to decrease the air/fuel ratio to make it rich until the 
peak rich voltage of the CMS is greater than a predetermined 
threshold voltage. Analogously, if a lean excursion is 
required then there is a command to have a lean air/fuel 
ratio excursion until the

A method for determining the functionality of an EGO sensor including the 
non-intrusive steps of: 


reading (13) the exhaust gas oxygen sensor voltage; 
comparing (14) the exhaust gas oxygen sensor voltage to a peak rich voltage; 
comparing (17) the exhaust gas oxygen voltage to a peak lean voltage; 
storing (15) the exhaust gas oxygen sensor voltage as the peak rich voltage if the 
current exhaust gas oxygen voltage is greater than the previous peak voltage; and 
storing (18) the exhaust gas oxygen sensor voltage as the peak lean voltage if the 
exhaust gas oxygen sensor voltage is less than the peak lean voltage; and further including 

the intrusive steps of: 
commanding (22) a rich air/fuel ratio excursion; 
holding (23) the rich air fuel ratio until there is a time out or the peak rich voltage is 
greater than a threshold rich voltage; 
if a time out happened, determining (25) that there is a malfunction of the sensor; 
commanding (28) a lean air/fuel ratio excursion; 
holding (29) the lean A/F excursion until the peak lean voltage is less than a threshold 
lean voltage or there has been a time out; 
if there is a time out, then a malfunction is detected; 
if no time out happened, then the sensor (31) is OK; 
A method according to claim 1 for determining the functionality of an upstream or a downstream 
EGO sensor associated with the exhaust of an internal combustion engine including the steps 

of: 

reading the voltage from each of the exhaust gas oxygen sensors, 
storing the peak voltage readings of the exhaust gas sensor voltages; 
comparing a peak voltage reading to a predetermined voltage window by comparing 
the peak voltages of the upstream sensor to a predetermined window and then comparing the 

peak voltages of the downstream sensor to the predetermined window; and  
 
adding a predetermined time delay between the steps of comparing the peak voltages 
of the upstream sensor to the predetermined voltage window and comparing the peak voltage

holding the lean A/F excursion until the peak lean voltage is less than the threshold 
lean voltage or there has been a time out; 
if there is a time out, then a malfunction is detected; 
if no time out happened, then the sensor is OK.
