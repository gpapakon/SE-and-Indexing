<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for drying a flowing gas which has an approximately periodically varying moisture content. In order to ensure that a preset dew point temperature is never exceeded, it is provided that the gas is conducted through a medium which can adsorb moisture regenerably and whose adsorption capacity is greater than the mean moisture content of the gas. In addition, an apparatus for carrying out the process is described, a source of flowing gas, in particular air, which has a varying moisture content being connected to a gas consumer, and a chamber filled with a medium is provided in the connection between source and consumer, which medium adsorbs moisture regenerably and has an adsorption capacity which is greater than the mean moisture content of the gas.

Method of designing an apparatus for compensating for moisture
variations of a gas which flows from a source and has a

substantially periodically varying moisture content, and a gas
consumer is provided which is connected to the source, wherein

the gas is guided, at the junction between the source and
consumer, through a chamber (32) which contains moisture-adsorbing

agent, and the adsorption capacity of which is greater
than the mean moisture content of the gas, wherein 10- to 20-times

the quantity of regeneratable moisture-adsorbing agent is used
relative to this moisture content of the gas per m
3
 hourly
throughput of gas in the chamber (32), and the agent removes, by

adsorption, the excess moisture content from the gas proportions
with a high level of moisture and releases the adsorbed moisture to

those portions of the flowing gas which have a moisture less than
the mean value of the moisture content of the supplied gas.
Method according to claim 1, wherein the gas is conducted

through the agent at a constant temperature of 20° C to 120° C.
Apparatus for compensating for moisture variations, said apparatus
having a source of flowing gas, more especially air, which has a

varying moisture content, as well as having a gas consumer which
is connected to the source, a chamber (32, 32a) being introduced at

the junction (30, 34, 5, 30a, 5a) between the source (10, 10a) and
the consumer (1), which chamber is filled with a regeneratable,

moisture-adsorbing agent and is designed according to claim 1. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein a bypass duct (50)
extends around the chamber (32, 32a).
