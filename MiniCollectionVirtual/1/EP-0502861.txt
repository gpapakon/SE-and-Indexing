<ABSTRACT>
A fetal probe (10) has an inflatable sac (24) which wedges between the presenting fetal part and maternal tissue to hold a fetal sensor (16) in position. The fetal probe is short enough (10-20cm) to enable insertion with the amniotic membrane intact. A passage (26) extends through the probe to facilitate intrauterine pressure measurements or amniotomy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to obstetrics and in particular to probes 
for fetal monitoring. The monitoring of the fetus is a vital aspect of modern labour 
management. Assessment of the fetal heart rate is a mainstay of such 
monitoring and can be done externally or by internal electrodes. In 
certain circumstances, internal monitoring is preferred and provides a 
more accurate representation of the fetal heart rate pattern for 
analysis. Internal monitoring probes are usually made of arcuate or 
spiral metal needles which perforate the scalp skin and are thus secured 
to obtain electrical signals from the fetal heart. Such probes can be 
considered invasive to the fetus. Alternatively, intrauterine probes have been designed which do not 
have to perforate the fetal skin and which have contact electrodes that 
lie apposed to the surface of the fetal body and scalp. Reference is 
directed for example to US-3,326,207 and GB-A-2,195,897. These probes 
are long and have several built-in electrodes to ensure that at least 
one of them is in sufficient contact with the fetal skin to obtain an 
adequate signal. Another sensor, some distance away, is used as a 
reference electrode. Unless already ruptured spontaneously, the 
membranes of the amniotic sac have to be ruptured artificially before 
such a probe is inserted. Because of this aspect and its overall length, 
such probes can be considered invasive to the mother and the uterine 
environment of the fetus. The probe disclosed in GB-A-2,195,897 comprises an elongate 
flexible strip having a series of protruding electrodes. The strip is of 
sufficient length (approximately 50 cm) to extend past the fetal head 
and along the trunk of the fetus. US-3,326,207, issued in 1967, 
proposed a fetal probe having two inflatable balloons positioned as to 
contact the shoulder and hip/thigh regions of the fetus, respectively.  
 Each balloon is spherical and carries six or so equatorially spaced 
electrodes. Additionally, each electrode is provided with a port for the local 
discharge of a conductive solution. The construction and operation of this 
probe is considered to be far too elaborate and cumbersome for practical 
application. WO 90/04352 (published after but filed before the priority date of the 
present application) discloses a fetal pulse oximetry probe which is 
deformable and attached to the fetal tissue using a vacuum pump. The 
probe can be inserted shortly after rupture of the amniotic membrane. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved fetal

<CLAIMS>
A fetal probe (10) comprising an elongate body portion (12) adapted 
for insertion into the cervix around the presenting part of the fetus, the body 

portion carrying fetal sensor means (16), further comprising
 
   location means (24) at the distal end of the body portion 

remotely expandable from an orientation facilitating insertion of the probe to 
a wedging orientation serving to urge the sensor means into close 

engagement with the fetus, the wedging orientation being such that the 
sensor means is urged into closer engagement on slight retracting 

movement of the body portion. 
A probe according to Claim 1, wherein the location means comprises 
an inflatable sac (24). 
A probe according to Claim 1, wherein the location means comprises 
integral wedging surfaces (52) urged outwardly on relative longitudinal 

movement between the body portion (12) and an elongate, parallel expander 
(58) passing through the body portion. 
A probe according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
body portion is of such a length as to enable insertion without rupture of the 

amniotic membranes.  
 
A probe according to Claim 4, wherein a passage (26) extends 
throughout the length of the body portion to enable subsequent insertion of 

means to rupture the membranes behind the presenting part of the fetus and 
to permit drainage of amniotic fluid. 
A probe according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
body portion is adapted to be inserted into the cervix to a length of between 

10 and 20 cm enabling positioning of the probe such that the sensor means 
(16) is held against the fetal presenting part by the pressure of maternal 

tissue with the amniotic membrane intact. 
A probe according to Claim 2, wherein the sac is shaped so as to 
present a wedge surface to the maternal tissues and serves to urge the 

body portion into closer engagement with the fetal presenting part. 
A probe according to any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising a channel extending through the length of the elongate body 

portion enabling the introduction of instruments into the uterus through the 
fetal probe. 
A fetal probe according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the fetal sensor means comprises in combination an ECG electrode (18) and 

means for transcutaneous fetal oximetry (20, 22).  
 
A fetal probe according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said fetal sensor means comprises a sensor (16) positioned at substantially 

the same point along the length of the body portion as the location means 
(24) so as in use to be urged into reliable, optimal contact with the fetal 

presenting part.
