<ABSTRACT>
A heating apparatus utilizing microwaves 
characterized in that it is possible to heat with a 

super high temperature over about 1000°C and also to 
control the temperature within the wide range from 

such a super high temperature to a comparative low 
temperature. The heating apparatus is composed of a 

heating element (1) mainly made of a carbon powder and 
sintered in honeycomb structure, a microwave generator 

(2) irradiating microwaves to the heating element (1) 
and an air blower (8) blowing air to the heating element 

thereby obtaining hot air with high temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the heating 
apparatus utilizing microwaves which is the most 
suitable especially for generating a hot air, for 
re-burning and purifying such as exhaust gas, for 
burning an inflammable thing and for heating objects to 
be heated, see GB-A- 2 231 762. Hitherto, there has been widely known a hot 
air electric heater with nichrome wire or a gas hot air 
heater using gas, etc. as a heating apparatus generating 
a hot air. Those hot air electric heater and gas hot 
air heater, however, could not easily heat to the 
temperature as high as 1000°C or over. Further, there have been some apparatus 
burning an object to be burned utilizing microwaves such 
as JP-A-4-301122 and JP-A-4-298623, etc. which mainly 
consist of filters, ceramics of honeycomb structure, a 
microwave generator and a waveguide. These apparatus 
are used to burn the particulates (very minute parts) 
included in the exhaust gas which generate from the 
internal combustion engine. The particulates are 
caught by the filter and are burned with microwaves. 
The filter and the ceramics of honeycomb structure 
including the microwave absorption materials will be  
 
heated by being irradiated with microwaves but not to 
the temperature as high as 1000°C or over because usual 
microwave absorption materials are not stably heated to 
such a high temperature. The object of these apparatus is to burn the 
particulates (very minute parts) of the exhaust gas, 
which are caught by the filter, directly with 
microwaves. The remains or the exhaust gas not caught 
by the filter will be exhausted without being purified 
and even the particulates caught by the filter may not 
be burned completely because the filter is not heated to 
such a high temperature as 1000°C or over. The present invention can heat to the 
temperature as super high as 1000°C or over and the 
object of the present invention is to provide a heating 
apparatus which can control the temperature within the 
wide range or from super high temperature (about 2000°C) 
to relatively low temperature (about 30°C). A heating element of the present invention 
absorbing microwaves heats to high temperature by being 
irradiated with microwaves and can heat the object to 
be heated to such high temperature. Being formed in the honeycomb structure, the 
heating element obtains high efficiency of heat 
exchange. Further it is possible to control the 
temperature in the wide range of from high temperature  
 
to low temperature by controlling the output of an 
electromag
