<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an entertainment electronics apparatus, particularly a television receiver, in which the programme is selected by means of so-called up and down keys. An operating mode is provided in which a fast run towards smaller or larger programme location numbers takes place. In this mode, a rolling display of the programme location number takes place on a display and the tuner is only tuned to the receiving frequency corresponding to the newly set programme location number after the programme selection or switch-over process has finished.

Entertainment-electronics apparatus having a tuner
which is tunable to the reception frequencies assigned

to the individual programme location numbers, and an
operating unit for choosing the programme location

numbers by means of two keys, one of which is provided
for choosing programme locations having lower

programme location number and the other for choosing
programme locations having higher programme location

number, the operating unit being capable of operation
in an operating mode in which a rapid scanning takes

place in the direction of lower or higher programme
location numbers and the rapid scanning takes place

during a continuous operation of one of the two keys,
characterized in that a rolling alphanumerical display

of the programme location number takes place on a
display (16) and in that the tuning of the tuner (10)

to a new reception frequency takes place only after
termination of the said continuous operation of one of

the two keys (5, 6).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that

it is a television receiver,
the said keys (5, 6) are cursor control keys
disposed on a remote controller (FB), and
the rolling display of the programme location
number takes place on the picture screen (16) of

the television receiver.
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the programme change operation is signalled

alphanumerically on the picture screen (16) in
addition to the rolling display of the programme

location number.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that

it is a television receiver, 
the said keys (5, 6) are cursor control keys
disposed on a remote controller (FB), and
the rolling display of the programme location
number takes place on a display disposed on the

front operating panel of the television receiver.
Television receiver having a tuner which is tunable to
the reception frequencies assigned to the individual

programme location numbers, an operating unit for
choosing the programme location numbers by means of

two keys, one of which is provided for choosing
programme locations having lower programme location

number and the other for choosing programme locations
having higher programme location number, the operating

unit being capable of operation in an operating mode
in which a rapid scanning takes place in the direction

of lower or higher programme location numbers and the
rapid scanning takes place during a continuous

operation of one of the two keys, characterized in
that, during the rapid scanning in the direction of

lower or higher programme location numbers,
abbreviated transmitter designations assigned to the

programme location numbers are displayed in tabular
form on the picture screen (16) of the television set,

the rapid scanning being signalled visually in the
table, and in that the tuning of the tuner (10) to a

new reception frequency takes place only after
termination of the said continuous operation of one of

the two keys (5, 6).
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, during the said

continuous operation of one of the two keys (5, 6),
the tuning of the tuner (10) to the reception

frequency tuned to before the start of the continuous
operation is maintained. 
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, during the said

continuous operation of one of the two keys (5, 6),
the picture screen (16) is blanked.
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1-6,
characterized in that, during the said continuous

operation of one of the two keys (5, 6) a picture from
a picture memory is displayed on the picture screen

(16).
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding

claims, characterized in that the two keys are the
ends of a rocker switch.
