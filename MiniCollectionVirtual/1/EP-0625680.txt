<ABSTRACT>
The heating process, in particular for dwellings, using a pulverulent or granular mixture consisting of plastic and a stabiliser, which mixture is swirled in a dry mixer with air, during which water circulating in a heating circuit is caused to flow round the outer wall of the mixer to dissipate heat, consists in that a mercaptide is used as stabiliser for the plastic particles and/or the swirling is effected in a container located [lacuna] swirling section extending over a horizontal region. It is carried out in an 
apparatus comprising a double-walled container (10) having a swirling device which is arranged in the interior (23) of the container and comprises a vane mixer (20), water being conveyed in the interspace of the double wall (11,12) as part of a heating circuit, and the preferably cylindrical container being arranged horizontally and having a vane mixer (20) capable of rotating about a horizontal axis.

Heating process, especially for apartments, in which 
use is made of small plastic particles, more particularly 

small PVC particles and a stabilizer consisting 
of a pulverized or granular mixture, which is 

vortexed in a dry mixer with air, in which the outer 
wall of the mixer is circumcirculated with water for 

the dissipation of heat, said water circulating in a 
heating circuit,
characterized in that
,
 
as a stabilizer for the small plastic particles, a 

mercaptide is employed and the vortexing is effected 
in a vortexing section extending over a horizontal 

area of the horizontally disposed container within 
the entire interior of the same, in which, by means 

of the heat dissipation, the temperature of the vortexed 
material is limited to a level not exceeding 

160°C, but expediently within a range of between 150°C 
to 160°C. 
Heating process according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the mercaptide is an octyl-tin mercaptide. 
Heating process according to either Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the vortexing is carried out in a horizontally disposed 

cylindrical container (10), in which a blade paddle 
(20) extending over the entire container interior 

rotates relative to the container wall ata rotational 
speed of from 1.450 to 2.900 rpm. 
Heating process according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 
the material containing plastic or PVC is comprised 

of waste and salvaged material, such as used bottles.  
 
Heating process according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
a proportion of PVC-containing material of up to 

80% by weight is admixed to other plastic material. 
Heating process according to any of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 
the vortexing is performed in a cylindrical container 

(10), whose ratio from the diameter D to the length L 
is approximately 5:8 to 5:9 and which is filled with 

material up approximately 4/10 to 6/10 of the height. 
Apparatus for the performance of the process according 
to any of Claims 1 to 6, comprising a double-walled 

container (10) with a vortexing means of a blade paddle 
(20) disposed in the container interior (23), in 

which, in the interspace of the double wall (11, 12), 
water is carried as part of a heating circuit,
characterized in that
 
the preferably cylindrical container (10) is horizontally 

disposed and possesses a blade paddle (20) rotatable 
about a horizontal axis and extending over 

the entire interior of the container (10), which is 
comprised of several arms (21) projecting radially 

from the shaft with paddle wheel plates (22), which, 
relative to the arms (21), are inclined through 30° 

or 60° ± 15°. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the blade paddle (20) is mounted on a horizontally 

arranged, motor-driven shaft (18).  
 
Apparatus according to either Claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that
 
each of the paddle wheel plates (22) substantially extends 

over the entire internal length of the container 
(10) and is retained by means of several, preferably 

three, successively disposed arms (21) projecting radially 
from the shaft (18). 
Apparatus according to either Claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that
 
at least three, by preference four, paddle wheel plates 

(22) are provided. 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 8 to 10,
characterized in that
 
the container is comprised of plastic, expediently PVC 

or of another, thermally conductive material, such as 
steel plate, which is provided with an internal wall 

coating of a plastic, advantageously PVC. 
Apparatus according to Claim 11,
characterized in that
,
 
as wall of the container (10) or as internal wall coating, 

a plastic with an incorporated mercaptide, more 
particularly an octyl-tin mercaptide, or a mixture of 

plastic, expediently a PVC and of a mercaptide, more 
particularly an octyl-tin mercaptide, is inserted.
