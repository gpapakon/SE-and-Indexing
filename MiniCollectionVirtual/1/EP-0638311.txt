<ABSTRACT>
A rejection inhibitor for transplants containing a carbostyril derivative represented by following general 
formula (1) or a salt thereof as the active ingredient, and an IL-1 production inhibitor containing said carbostyril 

derivative or salt thereof as the active ingredient. In said formula (1), R represents benzoyl which may be substituted 
by lower alkoxy; and the carbon-to-carbon bond between the 3- and the 4-positions of the carbostyril skeleton represents 

either a single or a double bond. The rejection inhibitor can improve the percentage take of transplants and is utilizable 
in the transplatation of various organs. The IL-1 production inhibitor is efficacious for the prevention and treatment of 

diseases caused by the excessive production of IL-1, such as various inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and myeloid 
leukemia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a graft rejection 
inhibitor and an IL-1 production inhibitor, each comprising 
a defined carbostyril derivative as an active 
ingredient. The organ transplantation performed these days 
encompasses a broad spectrum of tissues, including 
cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, pancreatic, small intestinal, 
renal, corneal, dermal, combined heart-lung and 
bone marrow transplants. Meanwhile, as drugs essential 
to such organ transplantations, immunosuppressants such 
as cyclosporine, azathioprine, mizoribine, OKT3 which is 
a monoclonal antibody, steroids, antilymphocyte 
globulins, etc. are in use for prophylactic or therapeutic 
immunosuppression in such organ transplantations. 
The advent of these drugs resulted in a marked 
enhancement of the success rate of transplantation but 
the massive and prolonged administration of the drugs met 
with not only severe myelosuppression and the consequent 
side effects such as leukopenia, thrombopenia, anemia and 
renal failure due to nephrotoxicity but also the risk of  
 
dangerous complications such as increased susceptibility 
to infection, anemia, bleeding tendency and so on. 
Therefore, the dosage of such drugs has to be restricted 
in many cases. In recent years, for further enhancement of the 
success rate of transplantation and for the purpose of 
alleviating side effects, research and development 
efforts are being made on FK506, RS61443, 15-deoxyspergualin; 
DSG), adhesion molecule antibodies, etc., but 
antibody preparations have the disadvantage of being 
unsuited for maintenance therapy requiring long-term 
administration because heterologous proteins are 
injected. Moreover, although combination therapies using 
the above-mentioned drugs are practiced in GVHD (graft-versus-host 
disease), a unique disease complicating a 
homoplastic marrow transplantation, the therapeutic 
effects have not necessarily been satisfactory. 
Therefore, the industry needs research and development 
for a new drug which may be termed a graft rejection 
inhibitor and can be used in a long-term maintenance 
therapy for positive suppression of both acute and 
chronic rejections with a reduced risk of side effects in 
cases of the organ transplantations mentioned above. Meanwhile, a large number of cytokines has been 
discovered as proteineous factors which inhibit the  
 
expression of various physiologic functions such as 
immune response, inflammatory reaction and hematopoiesis 
in the host and with the progressive elucidation of their 
structures and
