<ABSTRACT>
A continuous process for preparing polymers is provided: The continuous process 
produces polymers from monoethylenically unsaturated acids or anhydrides, and a nitrogen-containing 

compound, optionally in the presence of a fluidizing agent. The polymers are 
useful as detergent additives, pigment and mineral dispersants, additives for fertilizers, and 

corrosion and scale inhibitors in boilers and cooling towers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous thermal polycondensation process for
preparing polymers. In particular, the present invention relates to a continuous thermal
polycondensation process for preparing polypeptides. More particularly, the present
invention relates to the continuous thermal polycondensation of ethylenically unsaturated
acids and anhydrides using ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or a primary amine.Polypeptides, particularly polypeptides containing carboxylic acid moieties, such as
poly(aspartic acid) and those which can be hydrolysed to contain carboxylic acid moieties,
such as polysuccinimides, are useful as detergent additives, pigment and mineral
dispersants, additives for fertilizers, and corrosion and scale inhibitors in boilers and cooling
towers. Several processes are known for the production of poly(aspartic acid) and
polysuccinimide. However, the known methods for these syntheses are complex, expensive,
or require excessively long process times. The expense of these processes may be a result of
the starting material used, the process conditions, or the recovery steps.A method for the synthesis of poly(aspartic acid) from maleic acid and ammonia is
disclosed in US 4,839,461 to Boehmke. This process is carried out by heating an aqueous
solution of maleic acid or maleic anhydride, which changes into maleic acid while being
heated with water, and ammonia to give a dry melt of the monoammonium to
biammonium salts which, if the temperature is raised is converted at 120 to 150°C into
poly(aspartic acid). Boehmke discloses that it is preferable to raise the temperature to 125°C
to 135°C in the course of 4-6 hours and to keep it at this level for 0-2
hours. The maleic acid
and ammonia are reacted in a molar ratio of 1:1-1.5. The mixture is then heated to 120°-150°C
and the resulting solution of ammonium salt of maleic acid is evaporated, leaving a crystal
mash. The crystal mash is then melted, during which time the waters of condensation and
crystallization distill off. A porous mass results. The entire process, resulting in
poly(aspartic acid) having molecular weight of from 1,000 to 4,000, requires four to eight
hours to complete.The processes for the synthesis of polypeptides, such as Boehmke's method for
preparing polysuccinimide, are time consuming, complex, expensive, and inefficient. Other
methods for preparing polypeptides, such as those using amino acids as starting materials,
are also time consuming, complex, expensive, inefficient, generate large amounts of waste
and
