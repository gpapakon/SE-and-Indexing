<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a fiber bed for removing 
liquid aerosols and soluble solids from a ga
s stream in a 
fiber bed mist eliminator. The fiber bed is in the form 

of a flexible mat having a void fraction of greater than 
about 0.89 and greater than about 700 net collection 

targets. The mat comprises a layer of collecting fibers 
having an average fiber diameter between about 1 and 

about 5 µm. The collecting fibers (20) are stabilized by a 
plurality of stabilizing fibers (30) which penetrate into and 

are disposed interstitially within the collecting fiber 
layer. The improved fiber bed of the present invention 

is field-replaceable and, by utilizing fibers having a 
small average diameter, the thickness of the fiber bed 

may be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved fiber beds 
for fiber bed mist eliminators and processes for removing 
liquid aerosols and soluble solids from gas streams using 
those fiber beds. Fiber bed mist eliminators have found wide 
industrial application in the removal of aerosols from 
gas streams. Some of the more frequent applications 
include removal of acid mists, such as sulfuric acid 
mists, in acid manufacturing, removal of plasticizer 
mists in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride floor or 
wall coverings and removal of water soluble solid 
aerosols from the emissions of ammonium nitrate prill 
towers. In these various applications, fiber bed mist 
eliminators may achieve separation efficiencies of 99% or 
greater. It is generally known that fibers made of 
various materials may be utilized to construct fiber beds 
for fiber bed mist eliminators. The fiber bed is 
designed to collect fine liquid mist and soluble solid 
particles entrained in a moving gas stream and drain them 
through the structure of the bed. Typically, beds of 
collecting fibers are associated with metal wire screens 
or similar external support structures. The combination 
of a bed of collecting fibers and external support 
structure is known as a fiber bed element. As used 
hereinafter, fiber bed refers to that portion of the 
fiber bed element apart from any such support structure. 
Fiber beds may be formed by packing bulk fiber between 
two opposing support screens (bulk-packed beds) or 
winding a roving made of fibers around a cylindrical 
support screen (wound beds). Although not limited to  
 
such a configuration, fiber bed elements are most often 
configured in the form of a substantially vertical 
cylinder. Cylindrical fiber bed elements permit a high 
effective fiber bed surface area in a minimum of space. 
Flat fiber bed elements on the other hand, find 
particular application in high gas velocity applications. In operation, a substantially horizontal stream 
of gas containing a liquid or soluble solid aerosol is 
made to penetrate and pass through the fiber bed of the 
fiber bed element. The fibers in the fiber bed capture 
the aerosol in the gas by the mechanisms of impaction, 
interception, and Brownian diffusion. The captured 
aerosol coalesces on the fibers to form droplets of 
liquid in the fiber bed. The moving gas urges the 
droplets to move toward the downstream face of the fiber 
bed where the captured liquid exits the fiber bed and 
drains downward under the force of gravity. The fibers which comprise the
