<DESCRIPTION>
The invention involves the use of Ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide)
for the
manufacture of a medicament for treating viral diseases in
humans, caused by Arboviruses excluding Bunyaviruses, wherein
Ribavirin is contained in said medicament in a total dose
from 8.5 to 50 milligrammes per kilogramme of body weight per
day.The ongoing search for pharmacologic agents which
are effective against various disease states caused by
the over three hundred different immunologic types of
virus is an important one. Viral disease accounts for
some 60% of all diseases in humans. Among those viral
disease states for which cures have been sought are:
(a) bronchiolitis, bronchitis,
bronchopneumonia, tracheobronchitis, croup and
febrile respiratory disease associated with
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV); (b) Lassa Fever associated with
hemorrhage, fever, pharyngitis, enteritis,
myocarditis, pneumonitis, and, in fatal cases,
circulatory collapse;(c) Korean Hemorrhagic Fever associated
with Arenaviruses and its clinical
manifestations including severe toxemia, acute
febrile illness, widespread capillary damage,
hemorrhagic phenomena, severe central nervous
system symptomatology and renal insufficiency
(nephrosonephritis);(d) Neoplasms, tumors, infections, and
conditions such as Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) which is characterized by the
development of Kaposi's Sarcoma and various
infections; leukemias and lymphomas, associated
with Retroviruses (RNA Tumor Viruses) and
Adenoviruses;(e) Viral infections in immunocompromised
patients.As a result of the significant morbidity and
mortality of these viral diseases and the fact that
efforts to develop an effective vaccine have thus far
been unsuccessful, it is apparent that a chemotherapeutic
agent effective against these disease states is needed.
The search for effective antiviral pharmacotherapeutic
agents is further complicated by the significant
development of drug resistance by the various viruses to
antiviral agents other than 1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1, 2, 4-triazole-3-carboxamide.The present invention involves the use of the
compound 1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1, 2, 4-triazole-3-carboxamide
in the treatment of disease states caused by Arboviruses excluding Bunyaviruses
various viruses in humans. 1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1, 2, 4-triazole-3-carboxamide
has been shown to exhibit broad 
spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo.
The compound may be administered either by injection,
orally, topically, ophthalmically or via sprays or
aerosol
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of the compound 1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide
for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical

composition for the medical treatment of viral diseases in
humans, caused by Arboviruses, with the proviso that

Bunyaviruses are excluded, wherein the compound 1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide
is contained in said

pharmaceutical composition in a total dose from 8.5 to 50
milligramms per kilogramme of body weight per day.
The use of claim 1, wherein said human have a
compromised immune system in addition to said viral disease.
The use according to any of claims 1 to 2, wherein the
compound is present in the pharmaceutical composition in an

amount of 0.01% to 50% by weight based on the total weight of
the composition.
The use according to any of the foregoing claims,
wherein the composition is in a form suitable for oral

administration, topical administration, administration by
injection or administration via the respiratory tract.
