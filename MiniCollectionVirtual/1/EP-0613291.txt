<ABSTRACT>
An image reading apparatus for reading an image on film which uses a 
shading correction coefficient computation unit for obtaining a shading 

correction coefficient in order to correct irregularities in image signals of a 
photoelectric conversion unit, and a quantity of light ratio measurement unit for 

obtaining the ratio of the quantity of light of each emission color in order to 
equalize the quantity of light emitted by a light emission unit. The shading 

correction coefficient and the quantity of light ratio are obtained immediately 
before reading of a first original medium, and additional original mediums can 

then be read using the correction coefficients obtained for the first original. 
Alternately, the shading correction coefficient and the quantity of light ratio can 

be obtained immediately before reading each original medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image reading apparatus, commonly referred 
to as a "scanner" and, more particularly, to an image reading apparatus for 
reading 35mm film and similar image recording mediums. A conventional image reading apparatus used to read an image on original 
35mm film is illustrated in FIG. 1. A film original 3 is held by carriage 2 and a three-color separation filter 1 7 
is arranged in front of carriage 2. Separation filter 17 is, for example, a filter 
for the primary colors of R (red), G (green), and B (blue). A white light source 
16 is arranged in front of separation filter 17. Mechanical changeover of separation filter 17 is conducted by filter drive 
circuit 18, which is controlled by CPU 13 via I/O 8. White light source 16 
illuminates film original 3 through separation filter 17 and the transmitted light 
conducts image formation in CCD line sensor 4. Stepping motor 7 allows 
carriage 2 to move in a direction parallel with CCD line sensor 4. The formation 
image of CCD line sensor 4 is formed in a parallel manner (subscanning) by the 
parallel movement of carriage 2. CCD line sensor 4 is arranged so that its 
scanning direction is orthogonal to the direction of movement of the formation 
image (main scanning). Shading correction circuit 20 is a circuit designed to correct the 
irregularities in the quantity of light which illuminate CCD line sensor 4  
 
Correction data for the unevenness of exposure, determined at the time of 
factory shipment, is stored in advance in EEPROM 19. Using this correction 
data, the correction of output signals of CCD line sensor 4 is conducted. Stepping motor 7 is controlled by stepping motor drive circuit 6 via I/O 
9 according to the commands of CPU 13. Moreover, CCD line sensor 4 is 
controlled by CCD drive circuit 11 and image signals of CCD line sensor 4 for 
the main scanning direction are output to shading correction circuit 20. After 
irregularity correction by shading correction circuit 20, the output of shading 
correction circuit 20 is converted into digital data by A/D converter 10 and 
stored in memory 12. Stepping motor drive circuit 6 intermittently moves carriage 2 at uniform 
intervals and, with each movement, the image output of CCD line sensor 4 is 
converted into digital data by A/D converter 10. When the reading of film original 3 is completed, the data stored in 
memory 12 is output to host computer 1 5 via SCSI interface 14 and is used as 
the image data. FIG. 2 is a flow chart which shows an operational process of a
