<CLAIMS>
The use of solid polyethylene glycols for the
stabilization of molsidomine in tablets.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein solid
polyethylene glycols are employed in amounts from

1 to 40% by weight, particularly preferably 10 to
30% by weight, based on the tablet weight.
The use as claimed in claim 1 and/or 2, wherein
solid polyethylene glycols of molecular weight

1000 to 35,000, particularly preferably 6000 to
8000, are employed.
A rapidly disintegrating molsidomine-containing
tablet, which contains solid polyethylene glycol.
The tablet as claimed in claim 4, which contains
molsidomine in amounts of from 0.5 to

30 mg/tablet, particularly preferably 1 to
15 mg/tablet and very particularly preferably 2 to

8 mg/tablet.
A tablet as claimed in claim 4 and/or 5, which
contains solid polyethylene glycols in amounts of

from 1 to 40% by weight, particularly preferably
10 to 30% by weight, based on the tablet weight. 
A tablet as claimed in one or more of claims 4 to
6, which contains solid polyethylene glycols of

molecular weight 1000 to 35,000, particularly
preferably 6000 to 8000.
A tablet as claimed in one or more of claims 4 to
7, which contains customary auxiliaries and

excipients.
A tablet as claimed in claim 8, which contains
troxerutin.
