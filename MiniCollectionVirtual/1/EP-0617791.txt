<ABSTRACT>
Highly efficient automated measurement apparatus and methods for automated drug screening procedures are provided. The apparatus is capable of initiating and measuring rapid or transient events such as cell receptor and/or ion channel activity. The apparatus of the invention is capable of aligning with predetermined positions, one or more samples contained in a multi-well container, initiating the reaction with reagent addition and measuring a resultant attribute for a period of time. The apparatus is capable of substantially continuously measuring and recording data corresponding to the measured attribute before, during and after initiation of the reaction so that a time course of the rapid or transient event may be determined. After the reaction(s) are complete in one or more wells of the multi-well container, the apparatus can align one or more different wells to be assayed with the predetermined position and repeat the cycle until a predetermined number of wells are assayed. Automated drug screening methods employing the apparatus are also provided for screening for compounds which activate, inhibit or potentiate cellular ion channel or receptor activity. The assays are fluorescent indicator-based assays which utilize viable cells containing in their cytoplasm effective levels of a fluorescent indicator which is responsive to changes in ion concentration. Activation of the ion channels or receptors is initiated in the automated measurement apparatus by injection into one or more predetermined cell-containing wells of a reagent which is a known or putative activator of the ion channels or receptors of interest. The resultant activity of the ion channels or receptors (which causes changes in ion concentration in the cytoplasm) is determined by measurement of fluorescence intensity changes of the indicator in response to an excitation wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus
for assaying biological samples to which a reagent is added
and particularly, to computer-controlled methods and
apparatus for such assaying.Assaying processes are well known in which a
reagent is added to a sample, and measurements of the
sample and reagent are made to identify sample attributes
stimulated by the reagent. For example, one such assay
process concerns determining in a chromogenic assay the
amount of an enzyme present in a biological sample or
solution. Such assays are based on the development of a
colored product in the reaction solution. The reaction
develops as the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of a
colorless chromogenic substrate to a colored product.In such assays it is often required to determine
the enzymatic activity of a number of samples and at one or
more dilutions. Enzymatic reactions characteristically
proceed at a constant rate provided substrate is present in
a large molar excess, i.e., the concentration of substrate
does not limit the rate of reaction. With such kinetic
parameters, it may be convenient to set up several reaction
solutions separately in the wells of a microtiter plate,
for example, carrying out each reaction for a predetermined
constant amount of time and stopping the reactions while
they are still in a linear range of the assay. With each
of the so-called end-point reactions stopped, no further
color development occurs and the reaction solutions in the
separate wells of the microtiter may be read at any
convenient time.Plate readers which automatically read the
intensity of a colored solution in an array of wells are 
known. Also, plate readers which measure the amount of
fluorescence in a well of a microtiter plate are known.Classically, assays of the above-described type
are performed by a laboratory worker who prepares the
sample, manually adds a precise amount of reagent to the
sample, and then measures the result at one or more
preselected times after the reagent addition. This
classical approach is very time consuming for the
laboratory worker and additionally, when the stimulated
reaction yields time-varying results, precise timing on the
part of the laboratory worker is required. If such timing
is not properly performed, erroneous assay results may
occur.One known laboratory device for partially
automating tests to detect fluorescence as a measurable
attribute is the Fluoroskan II. The Fluoroskan II includes
a plate carrier system to hold a sample-containing plate
having a plurality, e.g., 96, of
