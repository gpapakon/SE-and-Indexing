<ABSTRACT>
Device for fastening a lid (3) onto a plastic container (2), of the type comprising lugs (5) snap-fastened into orifices (6). The lugs (5) are V-shaped and are each connected by the end of one branch (50) to the lower face of the edge of the said lid (3), the other branch (51) being free; the orifices (6) made in the flat rim (20) of the container (2), partially facing the lugs (5), are such that the corresponding lug (5) can only be inserted therein by virtue of the elasticity of its free branch (51), which folds back onto the fixed branch (50), the upper end (52) of the said free branch (51) coming to bear against the lower face of the rim (20) of the container (2), blocking the lid (3) in the closure position.
