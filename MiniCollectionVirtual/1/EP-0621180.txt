<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a strapping device with a channel 10 which surrounds the package 11 in the form of a loop and on which are mounted a closing, feeding and tensioning means which are each driven by a three-phase motor and which obtain the current from a common frequency converter 14, the frequency of the current being varied in order to vary the rotational speed, torque and phase relationship.

sensor (13) is installed immediately in front of the closing device and that once the 

beginning of the strap has passed the sensor (13) the frequency for the motor (16) 
of the feeding device is reduced in steps in dependence upon the distance travelled 

by the beginning of the strap or upon the distance travelled at the moving wheels 
(6) of the feeding device and the controlling computer (15) receives a signal at the 

end of each respective distance travelled. 
Strap hoop-casing device according to claim 4, characterised in that a device 
(17) which provides the signal consists of a light barrier whose beam of light passes 

through the tooth spaces of a toothed wheel at the transmission of the feeding 
device. 
Strap hoop-casing device according to claim 4, characterised in that a device
