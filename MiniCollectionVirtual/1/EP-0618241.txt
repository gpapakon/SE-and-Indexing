<ABSTRACT>
Fluoroelastomers comprising, by mole: 

(a) from 33 to 75% of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE); 
(b) from 15 to 45% of a perfluorovinylether (PVE); 
(c) from 10 to 22% of vinylidene fluoride (VDF). 
 
They are endowed with high resistance to polar solvents and 

to bases, excellent compression set also at high 
temperatures, low Tg and good processability.

 
They result particularly suitable for the manufacture of 

sealing elements (O-rings) for plants intended to the 
production of methylterbutylether (MTBE).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new fluoroelastomers
endowed with high resistance to polar solvents and to bases,
excellent compression set at high temperature, low glass
transition temperature (Tg) and good processability.It is known in the art the use of fluoroelastomers in a
plurality of applications where a high thermal and chemical
resistance is requested. An example of such applications is
the manufacture of sealing elements, in particular O-rings,
for plants intended to the production of methylterbutylether
(MTBE), for which a low compression set value is required,
especially at high temperatures, and a swelling rate in MTBE
at 55°C for 70 hours (expressed as percent of volume
variation) lower than 20%.For such purposes thoroughly fluorinated polymers are
usually employed, consisting of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE)
and of a perfluoroalkylvinylether (PAVE), such as, for
instance, those described in US Patent 4,948,853. Such
products, though having good resistance to solvents, show
poor properties of thermal resistance. Moreover, they are
characterized by high Tg values and therefore are processable 
with difficulty.The same inconveniences are present also in the fluoroelastomers
described in patent application EP-131,308. They
are terpolymers constituted by TFE, a perfluoroalkyl-vinylether
and vinylidene fluoride (VDF), the last one in amounts
not higher than 2% by mole. The VDF units act as site for
ionic vulcanization, which is carried out by curing systems
comprising a polyhydroxyl compound (for instance Bisphenol
AF) as cross-linking agent and a cyclic polyether as
accelerator. According to such patent application, the VDF
amount must not exceed 2% by mole for not impairing
oxidation and solvent resistance.Finally, in patent application EP-219,065, perfluoro-elastomers
are described, based on TFE copolymerized with
0.1-5% by mole of HFP and 12-50% by mole of a long chain
perfluorovinylether having the formula:
CF2=CFO-(CF2CFXO)m-Rf
where: Rf = perfluoroalkyl C1-C6; X = -F, -CF3; m = 1-5. The
presence of a small amount of HFP permits to improve
compression set and mechanical properties. However, they are
very expensive products, because an industrial scale
synthesis of long chain perfluorovinylethers is particularly
complex. JP-A-3066714 and Chem. Abs. 115:73436z disclose fluoropolymers
comprising by mole 45-55% TFE, 20-35% PVE and
15-35% VDF and exemplify a fluoropolymer comprising by mole
55% TFE, 24% PVE and 21% VDF. O-rings prepared from said
fluoropolymers show resistance to solvents such as
