<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production of an array of pixels arranged in a geometric pattern, which pixels have desired properties, such as electro-optical, magneto-optical or similar properties. Such pixels are connected by electrically conductive strips which allow one to connect at will one or more of the pixels with exterior recording means. Preferred are arrays of parallel pixels, arranged on parallel conductive stripes, on a transparent substrate which is an electrical insulator, with parallel conductive stripes at a perpendicular arrangement to the first stripes being in contact with the upper surface of the pixels. The pixels are generally in the micron or submicron size range, and a preferred material of these is bacteriorhodopsin (bR).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the
production of any array of pixels of heat-sensitive
material, with one of a wide variety of properties, such
as electro-optical, magneto-optical etc. properties,
defining an orderly geometric pattern, said pixels being
connected by a pattern of electrically conductive
transparent or opaque strips allowing for the connection
of one or more of the pixels with external means of
recording at any desired instant. Furthermore, the invention
relates to such an array.Recently there have been several reports concerning
the use in electrooptics of a unique biological,
polymeric and other materials. One example of such a
material is the membrane called purple membrane which
contains the protein called bacteriorhodopsin (bR). All
of the applications of bR for producing devices demand a
method that will be able to microfabricate this protein
containing membrane without effecting the electooptical
properties of bR. This is generally the case for many
of the newly discovered materials that will be important
in the future in electronic, optical and electrooptical
device fabrication. Many of the most unique
applications of such materials demand the generation of
an array of electrodes sandwiched pixels (Figure 1).
In the case of bR for example, since it is
a protein, it is not possible to use the generally used
techniques of microelectronics that microfabricate
silicon by methodolgies such as reactive ion etching
etc., without destroying the required properties of the
protein. In addition, any methodology designed for micropatterning
bR must be based on low temperature
processes since the protein is sensitive to heat above
60 degrees C. Conventional techniques used with the usual materials
in microelectronics, such as in the production of
printed circuits and semi-conductor chips are not
applicable with heat-sensitive substance which would be
deactivated or even decomposed by the drastic conditions
of conventional techniques, which employ corrosive
substances, high vacuum, etc. The novel process of the
invention overcomes these drawbacks and provides for the
production of mico-arrays of inter-connectable pixels
down to very small dimensions, in the micron size range.US-A-4 943 710 discloses an image sensor and a manufacturing
method for the same wherein a structure of conductive
transparent stripes connecting pixels sandwiched therebetween
in two different directions is disclosed. However, the pixels
in the known structure consist of a semiconductor material
and not of a
