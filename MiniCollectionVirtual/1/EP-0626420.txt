<CLAIMS>
Use of a moulding composition for the insertion into a mould and
the release from a mould of elastomeric conduits, whilst they are

being manufactured by the vulcanisation of a preliminary blank,
said composition comprising at least a first ester of a first fatty

acid, having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and at least a first ester of a first
alcohol comprising 6 to 22 carbon atoms, characterised in that the

first ester of the composition is selected from the group including
sorbitol monolaurate or ethoxylated sorbitol monolaurate.
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that, in addition to a
first ethoxylated ester, the composition contains water, preferably

in a quantity of less than 50 % by weight of the composition.
Use according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the
composition comprises ethoxylated sorbitol monolaurate and

sorbitol monolaurate.
Use according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the
composition comprises ethoxylated sorbitol monolaurate and

glycerol stearate.
