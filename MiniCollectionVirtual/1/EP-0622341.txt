<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the technology of manufacturing inorganic fibres by centrifugation on rolls (3, 4, 5, 6) having horizontal axes, using a jet (1) of molten material. Optical methods are provided for determining the relative position of the jet (1) of molten material with respect to the first roll (3) and for controlling this position. The technique employs CCD cameras (8, 11, 40). In the preferred variant, a camera (11) is focused onto the periphery of a fibre-forming roll (4).

Process for obtaining mineral fibres from 
a thermoplastic material with a high melting 

point, consisting in melting said material and the 
distribution thereof in the molten state in the 

form of a stream (1) on a rotor (3) of a fibre-drawing 
machine which may comprise several 

thereof, characterised in that the position of the 
stream (1) in relation to the rotors is determined 

on the one hand directly in a first horizontal 
direction (9), and on the other hand in a second 

horizontal direction (41, 18), either by 
determining the position of impact of the stream 

(1) on the first rotor (3) from an optical 
measurement performed on the stream (1) itself, 

or, directly, by the measurement of the position 
of the said material in the molten state at the 

periphery of one of the rotors. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the stream (1) is not 

rectilinear, that it is located in a vertical 
plane, in that the first horizontal direction (9) 

is approximately perpendicular to the vertical 
plane and in that the position of the jet (1) in 

said first direction (9) is determined by optical 
sighting of the stream (1) itself.  

 
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the determination of the 

position of the point of impact (42) of the stream 
on the first rotor (3) from an optical measurement 

on the stream (1) itself in a second horizontal 
direction (41) is performed by a calculation of, 

on the one hand, the result of the optical 
measurement, and, on the other hand, the known 

position of the starting point (44) of the stream. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the fibre-drawing 

machine comprises several rotors, and in that the 
measurement of the position of the material in the 

molten state is performed on the first or the 
second fibre-drawing rotor. 
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the measurement of the 

position of the material at the periphery of the 
rotors is performed by optical sighting. 
Process according to one of Claims 2 to 
4, characterised in that the optical sightings 

are performed by CCD cameras. 
Process according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the result  

 
of the determinations of the relative positions of 

the stream is used to control the position of the 
point of impact of the stream on the first rotor. 
Process according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the result of the 

determination of the relative position of the 

stream in one direction is used to control the 
relative displacement of the stream and of the 

fibre-drawing machine, substantially in the same 
direction. 
Process according to any one of Claims 4 
to 8, characterised in that the optical 

sighting on the periphery of the rotor is used to 
determine the width of the molten material there. 
Process according to any one of Claims 7 
to 9, characterised in that, in the course of a 

manufacturing period between two changes of 
rotors, the point of impact of the stream on the 

first rotor is displaced along a generatrix, 
on the active width of the rotor. 
Device for obtaining mineral fibres from 
a molten thermoplastic material and comprising a 

melting furnace, members for the distribution of a 
stream of molten material, and rotors intended to  

 
distribute the molten material and/or to 

centrifuge fibres, characterised in that it 
comprises, in particular, an optical sighting 

member, substantially scanning a generatrix of 
one of the rotors. 
Device according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that it also comprises an optical 

sighting member scanning a portion of a straight line, substantially 
perpendicular, at the same time to 

the stream of molten material and to the generatrix 
of the rotor scanned by the first optical 

sighting member. 
Device according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterised in that the optical observing 

members form part of CCD cameras. 
Device according to Claim 12 or Claim 13, 
characterised in that the members for distributing 

the stream of molten material are provided with 
displacement means in directions that are 

substantially parallel to the scanning directions 
of the optical sighting members. 
Device according to Claim 12 or 13, 
characterised in that the rotors intended to 

distribute the molten material and/or to  
 

centrifuge fibres are part of a fibre-drawing 
machine provided with means for displacement in 

directions that are approximately parallel to the 
scanning directions of the optical sighting 

members. 
Device according to Claim 14 or Claim 15, 
characterised in that an electric and/or 

electronic system controls the displacement means 
as a function of the indications provided by the 

optical sighting members.
