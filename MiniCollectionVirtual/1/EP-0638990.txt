<DESCRIPTION>
The circuit of the present invention refers an 
innovative design of the voltage-doubling driving offset 
method and circuit device for the DC series type excitation 
or compound rectifier motor, the total efficiency of the 
conventional series type or compound armature always tended 
to be low under voltage-doubling operation especially the 
low voltage operation due to the dropping of the excitation 
current in the insufficiency of the magnetic field 
intensity, it is aimed at the above shortcoming that he 
following methods are introduced, the features of which are 
:
 
   To perform sub-exciter control on the magnetic field of 
the DC series type excitation or compound dynamo (including 
generator and motor) especially increase the magnetic field 
intensity on low voltage or under-load operation without 
sufficient excitation and perform normal excitation on full 
load in order to attain saturated excitation or nearly 
saturated excitation under either full load or light load 
voltage to raise the efficiency in low voltage section, the 
main methods of which comprise: 
(1) To perform sub-exciter control against the series 
type excitation winding by means of the auxiliary magnetic 
field power supply for the motor providing series type 
winding; the auxiliary magnetic field power supply would  
 
increase the current of the series type excitation magnetic 
field on the reducing of the excitation current of the 
series type excitation winding, otherwise reduce the current 
of the series type excitation magnetic field; (2) The auxiliary magnetic field power supply would 
increase the excitation current of the series type 
excitation winding on the reducing of the current passing 
the series type excitation winding in compound motor, 
otherwise reduce the current of the series type excitation 
magnetic field;
 
   the above method is to get a constant or approximately 
permanent intensity magnetic field by means of reducing the 
sub-exciter while the excitation current of the series type 
excitation winding increased, otherwise increasing the 
sub-exciter to raise the efficiency of the low voltage 
section of the voltage doubling and light load;
 
   The difference between the present invention and 
conventional separately excited dynamo in normal operation 
district but preserving the features of low starting 
current, big torque and good overloading torsion of the 
series type excitation motor and avoid the shortcoming of 
the insufficiency of the excitation of the magnetic field 
resulting in the

A voltage-doubling driving offset method and circuit 
device of the DC series type excitation or compound 

rectifier motor, the features including such as to apply 
sub-exciter control to DC series type excitation or compound 

wound dynamo(including generator and motor) especially to 
increase the intensity of the magnetic field on low voltage 

or under-load operation without sufficient excitation , and 
maintain normal excitation on full load in order to maintain 

saturated excitation or nearly saturated excitation of the 
full load or light load under various voltages to raise the 

efficiency in low voltage section, comprising: 

(1) To apply sub-exciter control to the series type 
excitation winding of the motor by means of the auxiliary 

magnetic field power supply, to increase the current of the 
series type excitation magnetic field by the auxiliary 

magnetic field power supply on the reducing of the 
excitation current of the series type excitation winding, 

and reduce the current of the series type excitation 
magnetic field on the increasing of the excitation current 

of the series type excitation winding; 
(2) Increasing the excitation current of the series type 
excitation winding by the auxiliary magnetic field power 

supply on the reducing of the current passing the series 
type excitation winding by the auxiliary magnetic field 

power supply on the increasing of the current passing the 
series type excitation winding; 

   In the above method, the current of the sub-exciter 
will be reduced while the current of the series type 

 
excitation winding increased, otherwise it will be increased 

in order to attain a magnetic field with constant or 
approximately permanent intensity to raise the efficiency in 

voltage-doubling low voltage section and under load, 
The voltage-doubling driving offset and circuit 
device of the DC series type excitation or compound 

rectifier motor as stated in claim 1 to be constituted 
chiefly as follows: 

   A series type excitation dynamo to be constituted by a 
series type excitation S101 and the armature A101 to be 

connected in parallel, or the compound DC motor comprising 
further a parallel type excitation magnetic field winding 

F101; 
   The main power supply CPS100 as the DC power supply to 

drive the motor including fixed voltage or adjustable 
voltage DC power supply coming from storage power element, 

generator, solar energy, or the rectification of AC power 
supply; 

   The sub-exciter power supply CPS101 being connected in 
series to the blocking diode CR101 consequently or connected 

in parallel to the two ends of the series type excitation 
winding directly to perform auxiliary excitation against the 

series type excitation magnetic field winding either for 
power generation or the application of motor, to cause the 

direction of the voltage of the sub-exciter to be always 
connected in parallel in same polarity with the voltage drop 

of the series type excitation magnetic field winding, the 
sub-exciter power supply comprising the fixed voltage or 

adjustable voltage DC power supply coming from storage power 
 

element, generator, solar energy or the rectification of AC 
power supply; 

   The voltage drop on the two ends of the series type 
excitation winding S101 would increase when the load current 

IL increased, the voltage drop is reverse to the auxiliary 
exciting power supply; accordingly, the bigger the load 

current, the smaller the current of the sub-exciter; the 
smaller the current of the load, the bigger the current of 

the sub-exciter. 
The circuit of the voltage-doubling driving offset 
method and circuit device of the DC series type excitation 

or compound rectifier motor as stated in claim 1 using 
further an auxiliary storage battery or other storage 

element as auxiliary power supply to be constituted chiefly 
as follows: 

   The series type excitation dynamo to be constituted by 
a series type winding S201 and the armature A201 to be 

connected in parallel, or including further the compound DC 
motor to be constituted by the parallel type magnetic field 

winding F201; 
   The main power supply CPS200 which is the DC power 

supply to drive the motor comprising storage power element, 
generator, solar energy, or the fixed or adjustable voltage 

DC power supply out of the rectification of AC power supply; 
   The sub-exciter storage battery B201 to be connected in 

series with the blocking diode CR201 consequently and 
connected in parallel on the two ends of the series type 

excitation winding S201 as sub-exciter of the series type 
excitation magnetic field winding, the direction of the 

 
voltage of the sub-exciter is often connected in parallel in 

same polarity with the series type excitation magnetic field 
winding; 

   The charging current adjusting element set Z201 to be 
constituted by a dynamo or solid state voltage regulation 

circuit or current limit resistor to charge the storage 
battery whenever the value of the voltage drop of the series 

type excitation magnetic field winding S201 exceeded the 
value of the voltage of the auxiliary storage battery B201; 

   The voltage drop at the two ends of the series type 
excitation winding S201 would become bigger when the load 

current IL increased, and the polarity of voltage drop is in 
reverse direction to that of the sub-exciter power supply, 

so the bigger the current of the load, the smaller the 
current of the sub-exciter; the smaller the current of the 

load, the bigger the current of the sub-exciter. 
   The functions of the circuit above are: 


(1) For the motor providing series type excitation 
winding, sub-exciter control is performed against the series 

type excitation winding with the auxiliary magnetic field 
battery to increase the current of the series type 

excitation winding reduced; otherwise reduce the current of 
the series type magnetic field while the current of the 

excitation current of the series type winding increased. 
(2) While the current passing the series type 
excitation winding in compound motor reduced, it will 

increase the excitation current of the series type winding 
by means of the auxiliary magnetic field battery; 

otherwise reduce the excitation current of the series type 
excitation winding while the current passing the series type 

 
excitation winding in the compound motor. 
 
   In the above method, while the excitation current of 

the series type winding increases, the current in the 
sub-exciter will be reduced; otherwise while the excitation 

current of the series type winding reduces, the current in 
the sub-exciter will increase to obtain a magnetic field 

with constant or approximately permanent intensity in order 
to raise the efficiency in voltage-doubling low voltage 

section and under load.
