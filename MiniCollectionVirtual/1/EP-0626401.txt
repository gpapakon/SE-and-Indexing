<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aqueous binder composition and to aqueous coating compositions obtained therefrom which can be used, in particular, in multilayer coating processes. The aqueous binder composition contains:   A) 70 - 30% by weight of one or more water-thinnable (water-dilutable) oligomeric or polymeric polyol compounds having a hydroxyl number of 30 - 250, an acid number of 0 - 50 mg of KOH/g or an amine number of 0 - 50 mg of KOH/g and a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 500 - 10000, and B) 30 - 70% by weight of one or more polyisocyanates as crosslinking agent, having a mean NCO functionality of from 1.8 to 3.5 and a mean hydrophobic group content of from 0.1 to 1, C) from 0 to 20% by weight of one or more amino resins and/or phenolic resins, and   D) from 0 to 40% by weight of one or more masked polyisocyanates, where the per cent by weight of components A), B), C) and D) totals 100% by weight, and water and, if desired, one or more organic solvents.
