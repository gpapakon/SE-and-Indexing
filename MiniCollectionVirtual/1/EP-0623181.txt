<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS OF REMOVING DYESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a process of removing dye from a dyeing solution comprising a dye and a salt, so that the cleaned salt solution may be reused or dumped; and to an apparatus for carrying out the process.PRIOR ARTAccording to conventional dyeing technology, cloth is treated with a solution of a reactive dye. In order to encourage the dye to leave the solution and enter the cloth fibres, it is normal to include a substantial concentration of a salt (such as sodium sulphate or sodium chloride) in the dyeing solution typically in amounts of 20 to 100 g/L depending on the dye and depth of shade required. The presence of the salt effectively reduces the solubility of the dye in the solution and promotes adsorption of the dye onto the cloth by disturbing the equilibrium between dissolved dye and dye on the cloth. Typically, 80% of the dye in the dyeing solution is transferred onto the cloth. Of this 80%, typically 70% is reacted with the cloth, whilst the remaining 10% of dye is unreacted. Currently, the used dyeing solution comprising residual dye and salt is then dumped. However, the disposal of the used dyeing solution in an environmentally acceptable way poses significant problems. 

 In addition to salt, the dye bath may include conventional additives such as sequesterants, lubricants, and alkalis.Subsequently, the dyed cloth containing reacted and unreacted dye is washed with clean water a number of times. Typically, the first rinse uses cold water, followed by a second rinse at 60°C for 30 to 60 minutes; followed by a third rinse at 95°C; followed by two further rinses at 60°C. The exact sequence of washing steps employed will vary depending on the nature and concentration of the dye used, higher concentrations generally requiring more washing steps.A typical dye bath capable of dyeing 250 kg of cloth will hold about 3,500 litres of liquid. Thus, that same volume of used dye and salt solution requires to be safely disposed of. Whilst in a five stage washing process, five times that volume of dilute dye solution also requires to be safely disposed of. This poses a significant problem.It is an object of the present invention to mitigate these problems, and in particular to provide a process for the removal of dye from dyeing solution containing dye and salt.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides a process of removing dye from a dyeing solution comprising dye and a salt, which comprises: 

 - contacting the dyeing solution with

CLAIMS
1. A process of removing dye from a dyeing solution comprising dye and a salt, which comprises
- contacting the dyeing solution with particles of active carbon such that the dye becomes adsorbed onto the particles; and
- removing the particles having adsorbed dye thereon from the dyeing solution, so as to generate a cleaned salt solution of reduced dye concentration.
2. A process according to claim 1 wherein the concentration of salt in the dyeing solution is at least 1 g/litre.
3. A process according to claim 1 wherein the salt concentration in the dyeing solution is at least 3 g/L.
4. A process according to claim 1 wherein the salt concentration in the dyeing solution is at least 5 g/L.
5. A process according to claim 1 wherein the salt concentration in the dyeing solution is at least 10 g/L.
6. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the dyeing solution has an alkaline pH. 


 7. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the salt is selected from sodium chloride and sodium sulphate.
8. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the weight of active carbon used is from 1 to 20 times the weight of dye in the solution.
9. A process according to claim 8 wherein the weight of active carbon used is from 2 to 10 times the weight of dye.
10. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the particle size of the active carbon is 1 to 40 microns.
11. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the particles are removed from the dyeing solution by filtration.
12. A process according to claim 11 wherein filtration is carried out by cross-flow filtration wherein the dyeing solution and carbon particles are passed through the lumen of a bundle of porous hollow fibres and the cleaned salt solution passes through the fibre walls.
13. A process according to claim 12 wherein the porous hollow fibres are formed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. 


14. A process according to claim 11 wherein filtration is carried out in a back-pulse liquid filtration apparatus comprising a liquid filtration membrane.
15. A process according to claim 14 wherein the liquid filtration membrane comprises a porous polytetrafluoroethylene membrane laminated to a support fabric.
16. The use of active carbon particles for the removal of dye from a salt-containing dyeing solution.
