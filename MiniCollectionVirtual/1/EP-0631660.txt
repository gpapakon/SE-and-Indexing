<ABSTRACT>
A Michealson-type self-aligning interferometer utilizes a laser (1) to produce an output beam (20) of light that is split into a signal beam (40) and a reference beam (30). The signal beam (40) is directed through a Bragg-cell (5), for heterodyne detection, and a beam expander (6), for facilitating target acquisition, toward a retroreflector (7) located on a target body (80). The returning signal beam (54) is thereby reflected back through the beam expander (6) and Bragg-cell (5) to the resonance mirror (2) of the laser (1), and is now shifted in frequency by 2  ZETA . The returning signal beam (54) and reference beam (30) are directed into a detector (4) to produce an electrical signal (60). A frequency divider (8) and a phase demodulator (9) extract the phase information (70) of the electrical signal (60) through heterodyne detection, the phase being proportional to the position of the retroreflector (7) and, hence, the target body (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to self-referencing interferometers. More particularly, this
invention relates to a Michealson-type self-referencing interferometer that
utilizes a laser resonator mirror to achieve self-alignment.Michealson interferometers have been used, in various devices, for the
measurement of displacement, spatial non-uniformity, angle, and polarization
states of various reflecting bodies. Typical Michealson interferometer devices
utilize a gas laser to produce a beam of monochromatic light which is then split
into signal and reference beams. The signal beam is transmitted to and then
reflected from a target body. The signal and reference beams are recombined in
the device into a composite, co-linear beam. The difference in phase between the
two beams creates an interference pattern, or fringe pattern, in the composite
beam which is extremely sensitive to change in the position of the target body.
Hence, information about the dynamics of a target body can be determined by
study of the dynamics of the interference pattern.In such interferometer devices, the signal and reference beams must be precisely
re-aligned into a linear composite beam in order to maximize the signal-to-noise
ratio, or contrast, of the interference pattern. Current interferometer designs
require precision optical components and extremely stable mechanical structures 
to achieve this precise alignment. Moreover, such designs utilize more
components than necessary, thereby increasing the complexity and reducing the
reliability of the devices. As a result, such interferometer devices are relatively
expensive to manufacture, calibrate, and maintain.One difficulty with the Michealson interferometer is the problem of keeping the
reference and the signal light beams in exact parallel and colinear alignment.
This is required in order to obtain the highest contrast or signal-to-noise ratio.
Even with good initial alignment, small vibrations or temperature changes can
result in distortion or beam shifting resulting in beam misalignment. The
present invention uses an adaptive method such that any small shift or
movement of the optical components is of little importance. That is, the
reference beam and signal beam will remain colinear over small movements or
rotations of the optical components.For example, in the original Michealson device, two flat mirrors and a beam
splitter are used. The alignment of these optical components is very critical. Any
small rotation of a flat mirror can cause the two beams to diverge. Improvement

a gas laser (1) having an output mirror (2),
a beam splitting means (3),
a detector means (4),
a frequency and direction shifting means (5),
a retroreflecting means (7) located on a target body (80),
a frequency divider (8) and a phase demodulator (9),

characterized in that the elements are arranged such that an output light beam (20)
from the gas laser is directed to the beam splitting means for producing a first beam

means, the second beam being thence received by the frequency shifting means (5), so as

to be frequency shifted, and thence further directed to the retroreflecting means and
therefrom reversed in direction (54) so as to be received

by the frequency shifting means (5) again, so as to be twice frequency shifted, and
thence directed to the output mirror (2) for direction reversal back to the beam splitting

means (3) for reflection to the detector means (4) along the path of the first beam, the
detector being interconnected for sending an electrical signal corresponding jointly to

the first beam (30) and the twice frequency shifted beam (40) to the frequency divider (8) and
thence to the phase demodulator (9) for phase shift information which is directly

proportional to the position of the reflecting means.
