<ABSTRACT>
Switched power supply in which current mode control is performed 
and which includes an error amplifier (1) and an oscillator (2). 
This power supply also incorporates a differential amplifier (3) 
connected to the oscillator (2) to change the frequency of oscillation 

in the event of a shortcircuit at the output. The differential 
amplifier (3) receives the output signal (Vo) from the error amplifier 

(1). 
This output signal (Vo) from the error amplifier (1) is 
proportional to the output current delivered by the power supply such 

that when it exceeds a determined value, the frequency of the 
oscillator (2) is reduced in order to limit the shortcircuit current to 

a lower value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns switched power supplies in which current 
mode control is performed and which include a current limiting device 
in the event of a shortcircuit occurring, that is based on an 
additional feature whereby the operating frequency of such supplies is 
reduced when a shortcircuit is detected across their output terminals. It is particularly applicable to power supplies which have 
electrical isolation between the output stage and the previous stages. The technique of reducing the working frequency of switched power 
supplies when a shortcircuit occurs at their outputs was known prior to 
the invention described in this document. This can be seen, for 
example, in the Unitrode application notes "Linear integrated circuits 
data and applications handbook", published in April 1990, page 9-302. As is already known, the signal that drives the power stage in 
switched power supplies with current mode control, normally consisting 
of a MOSFET, is a square wave signal whose duty cycle determines the 
output voltage or current of the unit. In the event of a shortcircuit 
at the output, the width of the pulse in the square wave signal is 
reduced to the minimum, whereby the output current is limited to a set 
value. Nevertheless, the value of this limit is usually insufficient 
and, in addition, is difficult to control because it depends on many 
factors such as tolerances of the components used, delays in integrated 
circuit comparators, etc. Various forms exist of limiting the value of this shortcircuit 
current to a greater extent. One of the best known is to reduce the 
working frequency, as already mentioned, while maintaining the square 
wave signal pulse width at the minimum value; in this way the mean 
value of the shortcircuit current is also reduced. In the reference note already mentioned, in the figure on the 
left, it is possible to see part of the integrated circuit UC3842A and 
the associated external components that constitute the oscillator (pins 
4 and 8 of the integrated circuit, resistor RT and capacitor CT). With 
the values indicated of 
RT = 15 kÎ©  
 and 
CT = 1 nF  
, the working  
 
frequency is 105 kHz, as is indicated in the table. There is a further circuit consisting of a diode, the resistor RF, 
the transistor Q1 and the resistive divider connected to the output of 
the power supply, that is used to feed the base of the transistor Q1 
and pin 2 of the integrated circuit UC3842A, and which in turn forms 
the inverting input to the error amplifier used in the control
