<ABSTRACT>
A rotary shaft position sensor includes a 
stator (22) and a rotor (24) and produces a linear 

output signal in accordance with the rotational 
position of a shaft (68) coupled to the rotor. The 

rotor rotates about an axis of rotation. The stator 
includes stationary pole pieces (42, 44) having 

stationary pole faces situated perpendicular to the 
axis of rotation and spaced a predetermined distance 

apart to define an air gap therebetween. A Hall 
effect device (50) is situated in the air gap. The 

Hall device (52) produces an output signal 
corresponding to the level of magnetic flux in the air 

gap. One or more magnets (58) are attached to the 
rotating pole piece (60). The magnetic poles of the 

magnets are situated parallel with and spaced a 
predetermined distance from the stationary pole faces. 

Lines of magnetic flux originating from the magnets 
are situated in a direction perpendicular to the 

stationary pole face (54, 56). The rotating pole 
piece rotates in close proximity to the stationary 

pole piece (42, 44). As the rotor rotates about the 
axis of rotation, a portion of the magnet is aligned 

with the stationary pole faces (54, 56). Magnetic 
flux corresponding to the aligned portion of the 

magnet and the stator pole faces appears in the air 
gap. A temperature compensation circuit for use with 

the rotary shaft position sensor includes first and 
second temperature compensation circuits for 

counteracting sensitivity temperature drift and zero 
gauss offset temperature drift characteristics of the 

Hall effect device (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary shaft position sensors
and more specifically to a sensor that produces a
linear output signal in detecting the rotational position
of a throttle valve of an internal combustion engine.Electronic fuel injected engines used in motor vehicles
typically include a microprocessor based control
system. Fuel is metered, or injector activation time is
varied, in accordance with various engine parameters
detected through sensors. Some of the parameters include
engine temperature, mass air flow rate, present
vehicle speed, engine RPM, oxygen content in the exhaust,
and, most importantly, the position of the butterfly
valve or throttle valve that controls air flow into the engine.Typically the throttle valve rotates from a closed position
to an open position in a span of ninety degrees or
less. Throttle valve position detection is accomplished
by attaching a rotational position sensor to the rotational
axis of the throttle valve. The rotational position sensor
produces an output voltage signal in accordance with
the relative position of the throttle valve. The accuracy
and repeatability of the sensor over an extended period
of time must not vary significantly. Otherwise, the engine
control computer may be required to compensate for
drift or variance of the sensor. Software that must compensate
for sensor output signal drift can be unduly
complex and waste program memory space better used
for engine control algorithms. It is preferred that the sensor
produce a linear output and that over the life expectancy
of the sensor, the output signal versus rotational
position vary only an insignificant amount as temperature
extremes are encountered.Installation of a high accuracy sensor in the engine
compartment of a motor vehicle is a requirement with
regard to the throttle valve sensor. Temperature extremes
in the engine compartment typically result in
temperature drift of electronic circuits installed therein.Linear Hall effect devices are simplistic in operation
and may be used with non-contact type magnetic coupling
rotary sensors to produce a signal corresponding
to angular position. A more reliable throttle position sensor
that includes non-contact type operation and Hall effect
based electronics would satisfy several concerns of
automobile manufacturers good signal to noise ratios
are achieved and if the temperature drift of the Hall device
is compensated through a low component count
temperature compensation circuit. Reducing cost and
improving long term accuracy and reliability are
