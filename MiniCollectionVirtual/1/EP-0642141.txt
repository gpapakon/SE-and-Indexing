<ABSTRACT>
This surge arrester has at least two connecting fittings (terminating fittings) which are held by a frame (1), with at least one block (9) which is clamped in between the connecting fittings and consists of varistor material. In this case, the frame (1), the one or more than one block (9) and, to some extent, the connecting fittings are potted using an insulating plastic material to form a monolithic body. It is intended to create a surge arrester which can be produced from parts which can be manufactured easily and cost-effectively, with a comparatively small number of process steps. This is achieved in that the frame (1) is of integral construction and is manufactured from an insulating material. In addition, means are provided which maintain the contact force between the connecting fittings and the one, or more than one block (9).

<CLAIMS>
Surge arrester having at least two connection 
fittings, held by a frame (1), with at least one block 

(9) of varistor material clamped between the connection 
fittings, having means which maintain the contact force 

between the connection fittings and the at least one 
block of varistor material in which the frame (1), the at 

least one block (9) of varistor material and, in part, 
the connection fittings are cast in an insulating plastic 

material to form a monolithic body, characterized in that 

the frame (1) is designed in one piece and is fabricated 
from an insulating material. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that 


either at least one electrically conducting, resilient 
element or a frame (1) which is resilient in the axial 

direction is provided as the means which maintains the 
contact force between the connection fittings and the at 

least one block (9) of varistor material. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that 


the insulating material of the frame (1) is fibre-reinforced, 
in particular glass fibre-reinforced. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that 


random fibres are used for the fibre reinforcement of 
the frame (1). 
Surge arrester according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that 


the frame (1) is injection-moulded or extruded from 
polymer material, or cast from epoxy resin. 
Surge arrester according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that 


the connection fittings are designed as threaded pins 
(4). 
Surge arrester according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that 


one of the threaded pins (4) is connected rigidly to 
the frame (1). 
Surge arrester according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that 


10 to 80 per cent by weight of fibres are incorporated 
for the fibre reinforcement of the frame (1). 
Surge arrester according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that 


30 to 50 per cent by weight of glass fibres are 
incorporated for the glass fibre reinforcement of the 

frame (1). 
Surge arrester according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that 


the frame (1) is wound from at least one fibre-reinforced, 
in particular glass fibre-reinforced, strand 

impregnated with epoxy resin.
