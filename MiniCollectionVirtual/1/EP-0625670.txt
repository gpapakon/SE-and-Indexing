<ABSTRACT>
The seal fits in a pipe (1), having an inflatable cushion (5) in a holder (2). The cushion is of coated inelastic textile material, and in the uninflated state forms an annular hose with a folded wall (12), its OD matching the ID of the pipe. On inflation, it expands inwards from the pipe wall (8) to the centre. When uninflated, the hose outside wall (11) can bear against the pipe wall, while its inside wall (12) is folded. It can be secured by elastic components (15,16) to the holder, and which pull the inner wall into the folded position when uninflated.

Device for permanent installation in a pipeline (1) 
for at least liquid-tight closing of the pipeline 

(1), with a retention device (2) to which is 
secured an inflatable cushion (5) which, in the 

non-inflated state, is in the form of an annular 
tube with an outer wall (11) for positioning 

against the wall (8) of the pipeline (1) whereby, 
on inflation, the tube extends from the outer wall 

(11) to the centre of the pipeline (1), 
characterised in that the inflatable cushion (5) 

comprises a coated, inelastic fabric and, in the 
non-inflated state, is provided with a folded inner 

wall (12) whereby, on inflation, the tube expands 
until the pipeline (1) is closed by the inner wall 

in contact with itself. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the inflatable cushion (5) is secured to the 

retention device (2) with elastic securing elements 
(15, 16) which, with the cushion in the non-inflated 

state, retain the tube wall (12) in the 
folded state. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the inner wall (12) of the tube is folded in 

several layers in the axial direction. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the elastic securing elements (15, 16) are secured 

in fold lines (13, 14) of the inner wall, and exert 
an upward initial tension. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the inner wall (12) forms several chambers 

with the outer wall (11), and is folded in the 
circumferential direction.  

 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the retention device (2) has 

at least one tension ring (3, 4) which can be 
tensioned, together with a sealing intermediate 

layer (7), against the wall (8) of the pipeline 
(1). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that 
each tension ring (3, 4) is fitted upstream and 

downstream of the inflatable cushion (5). 
Device according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that the inflatable cushion (5) is secured to a 

clamping ring (3, 4) by means of at least one 
rubber elastic component (6). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the outer wall (11), by means 

of a ring-shaped, closed sealing strip, lies 
against the wall (8) of the pipeline (1). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the inner wall (12) is 

provided with a ring-shaped, closed sealing strip. 
Device according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in 
that the sealing strip consists of a soft elastic, 

closed-cell foam material.
