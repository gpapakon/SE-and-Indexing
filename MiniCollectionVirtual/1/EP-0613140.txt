<ABSTRACT>
An information recording and reproducing apparatus is 
disclosed which prevents the bearing surface of an auxiliary 

bearing (23) of a card carriage (6) in sliding contact with 
an auxiliary guide rail (5) from being locally worn. A main 

guide rail (4) and the auxiliary guide rail (5) are spaced 
in the same plan
e. The axis of the auxiliary guide rail (5) 
is oblique at a predetermined very small angle to the axis 

of the main guide rail (4). The auxiliary bearing (23) has 
a bearing bore having a slot-shaped cross section. Portions 

of the bearing surface of the bearing bore which are in 
contact with the auxiliary guide rail (5) are displaced 

transversely to the direction of the stroke of the card 
carriage (6) during the stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information recording
and reproducing apparatus comprising a chassis, a main
guide rail and an auxiliary guide rail spaced on an upper
surface of the chassis, the main guide rail and the auxiliary
guide rail respectively having circular cross sections
and the axis of the auxiliary guide rail being positioned
in the same plane as the axis of the main guide rail, a
card carriage capable of retaining an optical memory card,
the card carriage being slidably mounted by means of main
and auxiliary bearings on the main and auxiliary guide
rails and linearly movable along the main and auxiliary
guide rails, the main guide bearing having a round cylindrical
bearing surface fitting the cylindrical surface
of the main guide rail and the auxiliary plain bearing having
a bearing opening with a slot-shaped cross section,
the opposite upper and lower surfaces of the bearing
opening of the auxiliary bearing being in contact with the
cylindrical surface of the auxiliary guide rail, a head
carriage movable perpendicularly to the direction of movement
of the card carriage, and an optical recording and reproducing
head, fixedly mounted on the head carriage, for
recording and reproducing data into and out of the optical
memory card.Such an apparatus has been known from EP-A-0508111. In this
apparatus the opening of the auxiliary plane bearing has a
U-shaped form, whereas the guide rails are parallel. This prior art information recording and reproducing
apparatus has the following drawback: While the main plain
bearing is sufficiently durable for a longtime service,
since the main plain bearing has a round cylindrical bearing
surface which is in sliding contact with the main guide
rail, the auxiliary plain bearing is in line contact
with a certain portion of the auxiliary guide rail. Therefore,
a wearing due to this line contact tends to proceed
in the operation of the apparatus, so that the auxiliary
plain bearing has a poor durability. The wearing makes it
difficult to maintain the level of the upper surface of the
card carriage at an initial level, so that a predetermined
distance for recording and reproducing data between the optical
recording and reproducing head and the optical memory
card cannot be accurately maintained. Since the card carriage
experiences an oscillation due to the wearing at a
certain position in the bearing surface of the auxiliary
plain bearing, the card carriage does not stably reciprocate.
This adversely affects a recording and a reproduction
of the information

<CLAIMS>
An information recording and reproducing apparatus
comprising a chassis (1), a main guide rail (4) and an auxiliary

guide rail (5) spaced on an upper surface of the
chassis (1), the main guide rail (5) and the auxiliary guide

rail (4) respectively having circular cross sections and
the axis of the auxiliary guide rail (5) being positioned

in the same plane as the axis of the main guide rail (4), a
card carriage (6) capable of retaining an optical memory

card (8), the card carriage (6) being slidably mounted by
means of main and auxiliary bearings (21, 22; 23) on the

main and auxiliary guide rails (4, 5) and linearly movable
along the main and auxiliary guide rails (4, 5), the main

surface fitting the cylindrical surface of the main guide

rail (4) and the auxiliary plain bearing (23) having a bearing
opening with a slot-shaped cross section, the opposite

upper and lower surfaces of the bearing opening of the auxiliary
bearing (23) being in contact with the cylindrical

surface of the auxiliary guide rail (5), a head carriage
movable perpendicularly to the direction of movement of the

card carriage (6), and an optical recording and reproducing
head (18), fixedly mounted on the head carriage, for recording

guide rail (5) is oblique at a predetermined very small

angle (Óúç) to the axis of the
main guide rail (4)

in order that contact portions of the upper and lower surfaces
of the auxiliary bearing opening (23) with the auxiliary guide

rail (5) are displaced transversely from the axis of the main guide
rail (4) during the linear movement of the card carriage (6).
The apparatus as recited in claim 1,
