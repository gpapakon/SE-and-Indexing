<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cellular radio system comprising a plurality of base stations (BTS1-BTS4). Each base station comprises at least one radio transmitter (21, 22) and receiver (33, 34), an antenna means (ANT1) with a predetermined radio coverage area (CS1-CS2), and one or more allocated radio channels for establishing a radio connection with the mobile radio stations (MS) within the predetermined radio coverage area (CS1-CS4). The system comprises at least one base station (BTS5) including an antenna means that can be directed automatically or by remote control, depending on the time of the day or variation in regional traffic load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cellular radio 
system comprising a plurality of mobile radio stations 
roaming in the system, a plurality of base stations, 
each base station comprising at least one radio transmitter 
and radio receiver, an antenna means with a 
predetermined radio coverage area, and one or more allocated 
radio channels for establishing a radio connection 
with the mobile radio stations within the predetermined 
radio coverage area, at least the base stations with 
adjacent radio coverage areas having different allocated 
radio channels. In cellular mcbile radio networks the geographical 
area covered by the network is divided into 
radio cells, each of which has at least one base station. 
A certain number of frequencies (radio channels) 
are allocated to each base station, and said channels 
may in turn be shared by a plurality of TDMA (Time Division 
Multiple Access) traffic channels. The size and 
distribution of cells and the number of radio channels 
available to them are typically determined by the 
traffic capacity demand in said area. However, a 
cellular mobile radio network may include cells or 
larger areas where the traffic capacity demand may rise 
temporarily, e.g. at particular times of the day, to a 
very high level. If the number of radio channels in a 
cell is set on the basis of said instaneous maximum 
capacity demand, the number of radio channels increases, 
and consequently the amount and cost of radio equipment 
in a base station also becomes higher. Further, this 
kind of solution does not result in effective  
 
utilization of radio frequencies in a network. On the 
other hand, if the number of radio channels and the 
equipment of the base station are not set on the basis 
of maximum traffic, the number of failed call attempts 
becomes very high in said area at peak hours. The object of the invention is to overcome this 
problem. This is achieved by a cellular radio system 
according to the invention, the system comprising at 
least one base station including an antenna means 
that can be directed automatically or by remote 
control, depending on the time of the day or variation 
in regional traffic load. The basic idea of the invention is that at 
least one base station may, by mechanically re-directing 
its antenna according to traffic demand, direct part or 
all of its capacity (radio and / or traffic channels) 
to the area of the radio cell where the traffic capacity 
demand has temporarily increased. An advantage of the 
invention is that the number of
