<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly for printed circuit boards 
comprises a first and a second connector part. The first 

connector part has a first housing of insulating material and 
having a bottom and two opposite side walls and with male 

contact elements mounted in the bottom of the housing and 
arranged in rows and columns and having portions projecting 

from the bottom of the housing adapted to be inserted into 
holes of the corresponding printed circuit board. The second 

connector part has a second housing of insulating material 
adapted to be inserted into the first housing with an 

insertion side and with female contact elements mounted in the 
housing and arranged in a corresponding manner in rows and 

columns and having portions projecting from a lower side of 
the housing and adapted to be inserted into openings of the 

corresponding printed circuit board. A third housing is 
provided substantially corresponding with the first housing 

and adapted to be fixed with its bottom on the male contact 
elements of teh first connector part after mounting said first 

connector part on the corresponding printed circuit board. In 
the second housing at least one ground contact plate unit with 

a cross-shaped cross section is provided, dividing said 
housing in quadrants with a mutually equal plurality, 

preferably four, of female contact elements, wherein the 
ground contact plate unit at the insertion side of the second 

housing projects from this housing along a distance 
substantially corresponding with the thickness of the bottom 

of the first and third housings, respectively. A cross-shaped 
slot is provided in the bottom of the first and third housings 

for receiving the ground contact plate unit, said slot 
dividing the bottom of the housing in quadrants with said 

plurality of male contact elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector assembly for 
printed circuit boards, comprising a first connector part with 
a first housing of insulating material and having a bottom and 
two opposite side walls and with male contact elements mounted 
in the bottom of the housing and arranged in rows and columns 
and having portions projecting form the bottom of the housing, 
which projecting portions can be inserted into holes of the 
corresponding printed circuit boards, and a second connector 
part with a second housing of insulating material and adapted 
to be inserted into the first housing with an insertion side 
and with female contact elements mounted in the housing and 
arranged in a corresponding manner in rows and columns and 
having portions projecting from a lower side of the housing, 
which projection portions can be inserted into holes of the 
corresponding printed circuit board. Such a connector assembly is disclosed for example in 
EP-A-0 446 980. In this known connector assembly the second 
connector part comprises a plurality of outer conductors each 
substantially enclosing in circumferential direction at least 
one female contact element operating as signal contact and 
each contacting the adjacent ground contacts of the 
corresponding signal contact of the first connector part. In 
this manner a correct signal transmission can be obtained also 
at high bit rates of the signals to be transmitted. Further, 
outer conductors can also be provided in this known connector 
assembly for the male contact elements operating as signal 
contacts. Although an optimal signal transmission can be 
realized with this known connector assembly also at high bit 
rates, the construction is less suitable for applications, 
wherein the signal contacts must be very closely spaced one 
from the other. The invention aims to provide a connector assembly of 
the abovementioned type, wherein an optimal signal 
transmission at high bit rates is possible, wherein the signal 
contacts can be closely spaced and by means of which the 
printed circuit boards can be connected to a central printed 
circuit board on both sides.  
 To this end a third housing is added to the connector 
assembly according to the invention, which can be fixed with 
its bottom to the male contact elements of the first connector 
part after mounting said first connector part on the 
corresponding printed circuit board, in the second housing at 
least one cross-shaped ground contact plate unit in cross 
section being provided, dividing said housing
