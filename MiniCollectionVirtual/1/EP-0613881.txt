<ABSTRACT>
This invention describes an integrated process for making ethylidene 
bisformamide in high yield wherein water, which is formed as a reaction by-product, is 

readily removed from the reaction product mixture without adversely affecting the 
efficiency of the overall process. The process contemplates isolating the reaction zone 

from the separation zone and comprises circulating a stream of formamide through a 
reaction zone containing a solid acidic catalyst and a separation zone; introducing 

acetaldehyde into the circulating stream of formamide to form a reaction mixture and 
contacting the reaction mixture with the solid acidic catalyst under reaction conditions 

sufficient to form a product mixture comprising ethylidene bisformamide and water; and 
separating water from the product mixture in the separation zone to form a water-depleted 

product mixture containing ethylidene bisformamide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalytic process for preparing ethylidene 
bisformamide from formamide and acetaldehyde. Ethylidene bisformamide is used to prepare various poly(vinylamines) which are 
used to manufacture numerous pharmaceuticals and water treatment chemicals. 
Typically, ethylidene bisformamide is cracked to form N-vinylformamide monomer which 
is polymerized to form poly(N-vinylformamide). The resulting polymer is then 
hydrolyzed to form the desired poly(vinylamine). Several methods are known for 
producing ethylidene bisformamide. US-A-4 490 557 issued December 25, 1984 to Dawson et al. discloses a 
process for preparing ethylidene bisformamide wherein dry acetaldehyde and formamide 
are reacted in the presence of an acidic catalyst and an ammonia scavenger such as 
acetic anhydride. Ethylidene bisformamide is recovered from the reaction mixture via 
wiped film evaporation. Suitable acidic catalysts include formic acid, acetic acid, mineral 
acids or acidic ion exchange resins. The patent teaches the feed stocks and the catalysts 
should be dried prior to use in order to minimize the presence of water in the reaction 
zone. Water generated during the reaction can also be trapped by acetic anhydride. 
Other steps to minimize water include blanketing the reaction zone with a dry gas. US-A-4 906 777 issued March 6, 1990 to Pinschmidt, Jr., et al., discloses 
a process for making ethylidene bisformamide wherein formamide and acetaldehyde, in a 
mole ratio of at least 3:1, and a high concentration of formic acid are reacted under 
conditions sufficient to form ethylidene bisformamide. Water formed in the reaction  
 
zone can be distilled out as a binary or terniary azeotrope with one or more co-solvents 
such as toluene or hexane. Japanese Patent Application No. 2-32245, filed February 13, 1990, and laid open 
October 22, 1991 discloses a process for making ethylidene bisformamide wherein 
N-(α-hydroxyethyl)formamide and formamide are subjected to a dehydrocondensation 
reaction in the presence of an acidic catalyst such as an ion exchange resin. 
N-(α-hydroxyethyl)formamide is stated to be a required starting material The product 
mixture formed in the reaction zone consists of N-(α-hydroxyethyl)formamide, 
formamide, ethylidene bisformamide and water in the presence of the acidic catalyst. 
Water can be stripped from the reaction mixture at elevated temperature. Researchers continue their quest to discover improved processes for preparing 
ethylidene bisformamide wherein water can
