<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveying plant, consisting of a rail-bound transverse-transport car (1) with drivable conveying rollers (8) and a plurality of driveless roller conveyors (2) terminated along the path of the transverse-transport car. So that goods, especially palletised goods stacks, can be transferred from the driveless roller conveyor onto a transverse-transport car, or vice versa, the transverse-transport car is to have a push rod (13) which can be extended in the direction of transport of the roller conveyor and which carries on top, at least in portions, a friction covering which engages on the underside of the rollers (23) of the roller conveyor during the extension of the push rod.

Conveyor installation consisting of a track-bound transverse 
transport carriage (1) with drivable conveyor rollers (8) and of 

several non-driven roller conveyors (2) ending along the path of the 
transverse transport carriage, characterised thereby that the 

transverse transport carriage (1) comprises a pushrod (13), which can 
be driven out in transport direction of the roller conveyor (2) and 

which at the upper side carries at least in sections a friction 
coating (22) which engages at the underside of the rollers (23) of a 

roller conveyor (2) during driving-out of the pushrod (13). 
Conveyor installation according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby that the roller conveyors (2) have a guide rail (24) for the 

pushrod (13) below their rollers (23). 
Conveyor installation according to claim 2, characterised 
thereby that the guide rail (24) is resiliently supported. 
Conveyor installation according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby that the pushrod (13) has at its underside a 

toothing in which a gearwheel of a drive unit engages. 
Conveyor installation according to claim 4, characterised 
thereby that the pushrod (13) has a downwardly open, U-shaped 

profile, that a sprocket chain (19) is retained between the U-limbs 
(17) and that the drive unit (21) comprises a sprocket (20) engaging 

in the sprocket chain (19). 
Conveyor installation according to claim 5, characterised 
thereby that slide rails (16) are fastened at the outer sides of the 

U-limbs (17) and are associated with a guide (14, 15) at the 
transverse transport carriage (1). 
Conveyor installation according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by a control of such a kind that for transfer from a 

roller conveyor (2) to the transverse transport carriage (1)  
 

initially the pushrod (13) is driven out and then the conveyor 
rollers drive (9) of the transverse transport carriage (1) is started 

after a time delay and that for transfer from the transverse 
transport carriage (1) to a roller conveyor (2) initially the pushrod 

(3) is driven out into its end position and subsequently the conveyor 
rollers drive (9) of the transverse transport carriage (11) is 

started and then the pushrod (13) is driven back after a time delay. 
Conveyor installation according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised thereby that a light barrier (27) is arranged at the 

transverse transport carriage (1) at the side of the roller 
conveyors.
