<ABSTRACT>
In a digital audio-signal transmission process, the digitalized audio-signals are coded in subbands; one or more scaling factors are determined for each subband, the thus coded signals are transmitted in data frames, then decoded and reproduced at the reception side. The data frame has several parts, i.e. a header, an error control and/or correcting part, a preferably CRC protection word (cyclic redundancy check), an audio data part having among others a bit allocation table, a scaling factor selecting information, one or several scaling factors per transmitted subband, scanning values, essentially meaningless filling bits and a supplementary information part with audio-signal-dependent supplementary information. The object of the invention is to improve the protection of the above-described subband-coded audio-signals against transmission errors. For that purpose, supplementary error protection information or an error protection bit is introduced in the data frame, instead of meaningless filling bits, in order to protect the scaling factors. Acoustically unconfortable play-back disturbances caused by scaling factor errors are thus eliminated. The invention finds applications in digital audio broadcast (DAB), DAB-receivers, recorders and play-back systems.

A method for transmitting, storing and/or receiving digital, sub-band 
coded audio signals in which one or more scaling factors are associated with 

subbands, and the thus coded signals are transmitted in succeeding data frames 
and decoded and reproduced at the receiving end, in which a data frame 

comprises the following parts; 

a header with digitalized items of check information such as a synchronising 
word, an item of bit rate information, an item of sampling information, items 

of mode information; 
an error checking and/or correcting part with a first error protection code; 
an audio data part, 
characterised by:
the first error protection code is a CRC protection word and relates only to 
the header; 
the audio data part includes inter alia a bit allocation table, an item of 
scaling factor selection information, the scaling factors associated with the 

subbands and sampling values; 
an ancillary information part with items of ancillary information relating to 
the audio signals, in which for the protection of the MSBs of scaling factors a 

further CRC-word or further CRC-words is or are inserted at the end of the 
data frame in the region of the ancillary information relating to the audio 

signals. 
A method for transmitting, storing and/or receiving digital, sub-band 
coded audio signals in which one or more scaling factors are associated with 

subbands, and the thus coded signals are transmitted in succeeding data frames 
and decoded and reproduced at the receiving end, in which a data frame

the audio data part includes inter alia a bit allocation table, an item of 
scaling factor selection information, the scaling factors associated with the 

subbands, and sampling values; 
the first error protection code is a CRC protection word and is provided for 
the detection of transmission errors of the header and the scaling factor 

selection information and the bit allocation table from the audio part; 
an ancillary information part with items of ancillary information relating to 
the audio signals, in which for the protection of the MSBs of scaling factors a 

further CRC word or further CRC words is or are inserted at the end of the 
data frame in the region of the ancillary information relating to the audio 

signals.
