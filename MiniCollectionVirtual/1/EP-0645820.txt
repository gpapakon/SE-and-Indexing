<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device and more specifically to a semiconductor device
having a complementary MOS (CMOS)As a semiconductor integrated circuit device becomes
larger in scale, an LSI in which a high speed logic
circuit and a mass storage unit are mounted on the same
semiconductor chip is in general use. In order to
achieve high speed operation of a large capacity semiconductor
integrated circuit, it is most effective to
miniaturize a MOS transistor so as to improve the performance
thereof and ( metal oxide semiconductor) to increase
an integration degree by miniaturization. Furthermore,
it is effective as a countermeasure for the reduction of
parasitic components to lower the resistance of a gate
electrode of the MOS transistor and to lower the resistance
of a source/drain diffused layer effectively.
Further, it also produces an effect to increase the
integration degree and to shorten a mean interconnection
length by increasing interconnection density.On the other hand, an SRAM cell using six MOS
transistors is used frequently as the memory of a device
of this sort, and it is desired to reduce the cell area
for the purpose of achieving a large capacity in this
device.The improvement of basic performance of a MOS
transistor follows a scaling rule, and has been achieved
by reduction in the measurements of a plane component and
reduction of the thickness of a diffused layer located in 
a depth direction.As to the reduction of the resistance of the gate
electrode of a MOS transistor, a salicide technique in
which refractory metal silicide and polysilicon are
laminated one upon another, and the refractory metal
silicide is formed in a self-align manner on a polycide
gate obtained by applying patterning to the lamination or
polysilicon is known.Further, as to the effective reduction of the
resistance of the source/drain diffused layer, a salicide
technique in which refractory metal silicide is formed in
a self-align manner on a diffused layer or a technique in
which a metal film is formed on the diffused layer
selectively by a chemical vapor deposition method is
known.Furthermore, in order to increase the interconnection
density, a technique for interconnection without an
interlayer insulating film instead of contacting
interconnections through an opening portion of the
interlayer insulating film, i.e., what is called a local
interconnection technique is known. This technique is
also used for the SRAM cell, thereby aiming at reduction
of the cell area.Further, as to a p-channel
