<ABSTRACT>
A preceramic polymetalosilazane substantially free 
of Si-O groups is produced by reacting a polysilazane with a 

metal alkoxide in the presence of an alkylsilazane or 
alkylsilane. The preceramic polymer gives a high strength 

and heat resistant ceramic body which remains amorphous when 
calcined at 1,600째C for 10 hours in the atmosphere of 

nitrogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of producing a low oxygen content
polymetalosilazane, and also to a process of producing
a metal-containing silicon
nitride ceramic from the polymetalosilazane.Ceramic fibers have been attracting much attention
for their favorable properties such as high mechanical
strengths and resistance to heat and chemicals and will find
use for a variety of applications as reinforcing materials
for various composite articles such as engine parts, fan
blades and aircraft structures.US-A-4,886,860 discloses a process of preparing a
polymetalosilazane wherein a polysilazane having a number
molecular weight of 100-50,000 and having a skeleton
consisting essentially of units of the following general
formula:

wherein R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from
hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a cycloalkyl
group, an aryl group, a group other than the above-mentioned
groups in which the atom bonded directly to the silicon atom
is a carbon atom, an alkylsilyl group, an alkylamino group
and an alkoxy group, is reacted with a metal alkoxide of the
formula:
M(OR4)n
wherein M is a metal selected from those of groups IIA and
III through V of the Periodic Table, R4 is hydrogen, an alkyl
having 1-20 carbon atoms or an aryl and n is the valence of
the metal M with the proviso that at least one of the R4
groups is an alkyl group or aryl group. The polymetalosilazane
obtained by the above method unavoidably contains
oxygen derived from the metal alkoxide. The oxygen
introduced into the polymer is converted into SiO gas during
the calcining stage so that small pores or gaps are apt to be
formed in the ceramic product, which adversely affects the
mechanical strengths and heat resistance of the ceramic. US-A-4730026 (equivalent to EP-A-262914)
discloses a polymetalosilazane which is obtained by
reacting a silazane with an oxygen-free metal compound
such as an alkyl metal or a metal halide and in which the
silazane is cross-linked with, for example, -MR- linkages,
and a ceramic body obtained therefrom.
The polymetalosilazane obtained using the oxygen free
metal compound gives a ceramic having a low oxygen.
However, the above method is not practical and requires
much cost because the metal compound is dangerous.EP-A-0404503 discloses a substantially
amorphous, silicon nitride-based ceramic shaped body
containing Si, N and B as essential elements and O, C and
H as optional elements, obtained by forming a
polyborosilazane into a desired shape, followed by
sintering or calcining the shaped
