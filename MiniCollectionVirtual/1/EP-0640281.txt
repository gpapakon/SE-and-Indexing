<ABSTRACT>
An electrically controlled dedicated pulsator suitable for a milking machine 
wherein said pulsator has its pulsation sequence controlled by processing means 

associated with or including timing means, the arrangement being such that, upon 
receiving an external signal (e.g. electrical energisation), the start delay of the 

pulsation sequence as well as the pulsation sequence itself is determined by the 
processing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in and/or relating to the control
of pulsators in a milking machine and related means and methods.Several methods of control of the milking sequence in a milking machine where
sets of cups have, in common, a common vacuum source and common milk lines are
known. Such control systems to provide a ripple in the sequence to avoid overloading
of either the milk line or the vacuum source are known and such control systems range
from multi-phase control boxes to a system which sequences itself on a signal sent from
one pulsator to another. By way of an example of such systems, reference should be
made to New Zealand Patent Specification Nos. 210351 and 220533.US-A-4690099 discloses a pulsator system in which the time delays are passed
on from each pulsator to the next in the circuit. Thus the delays are actually
determined by the CPU of the previous pulsator, and the pulsator timing is dependent
on the action of all other pulsators in the circuit.GB-A-2207568
which shows the preamble of claims 1, 2 and 5
discloses a circuit in which the first pulsator controls the other
pulsator units in turn, and by propagating the original pulse or pulses via  time delays
within each of the units.The present invention, however, provides a departure from such systems.In a first aspect the present invention consists in an electrically controlled
dedicated pulsator suitable for use as one of several pulsators in a milking machine, said
dedicated pulsator comprising a computerised processor and timing means, said
computerised processor and said timing means being arranged so that the computerised
processor determines a pulsation sequence, and also determines a start delay of the
pulsation sequence, said computerised processor being arranged so as to determine a
start time by reference to said timing means, characterized in that
the pulsator has only one electrical connection thereby enabling
said timing means
to be initiated solely by reference to the commencement of electrical energization of the 
computerised processor.In a second aspect the present invention consists in a milking machine having
a plurality of milking claws, each controlled by at least one electrically controlled
dedicated pulsator, said at least one electrically controlled dedicated pulsator comprising
computerised processing means and timing means, said computerised processing means
having a pulsation sequence controlled by said computerised processing means, said
computerised processing means being arranged such

An electrically controlled dedicated pulsator suitable for use as one of
several pulsators in a milking machine, said dedicated pulsator comprising a

computerised processor and timing means, said computerised processor and said timing
means being arranged so that the computerised processor determines a pulsation

sequence, and also determines a start delay of the pulsation sequence, said computerised
processor being arranged so as to determine a start time by reference to said timing

means, characterized in that
the pulsator has only one electrical connection thereby enabling

said timing means to be initiated solely by reference to the
commencement of electrical energization of the computerised processor.
A milking machine having a plurality of milking claws, each controlled
by at least one electrically controlled dedicated pulsator, said at least one electrically

controlled dedicated pulsator comprising computerised processing means and timing

means, said computerised processing means having a pulsation sequence controlled by
said computerised processing means, said computerised processing means being

arranged such that there is a ripple sequencing of pulsation of the milking claws by said
computerised processing means, characterized in that each claw is controlled by

reference to its timing means without signals from or to other claws, and in that said
timing means are synchronised by electrical energization of a common power supply

of the milking machine.
The milking machine of claim 2 wherein said timing means are
each synchronised upon start up of the milking machine by virtue of electrical

energization of the computerised processing means at start up.
The milking machine of any one of claims 2 to 3 wherein said pulsator
is identifiable by a reference number associated with each computerized processor, and

wherein a common program which includes at least most of the reference numbers is
included in each computerised processing means. 
A method of ripple sequencing pulsations of a plurality of pulsators
in a milking machine, said method comprising the steps of:


providing each milking claw of the milking machine with a computerised
processing means capable of determining which of said plurality of pulsators is

controlled by the computerised processing means;
in response to electrical energization of said computerised processing means,
synchronising said plurality of pulsators;

   characterized in that each
pulsator has a respective timing means and only one electrical connection so that each

milking claw is controlled via a respective one of
said computerised processing means to pulsate in a pulsation sequence with reference

only to said respective timing means and without reference to any other processing means
and without reference to the status of any other pulsator or timing means.
A method of claim 5 wherein each timing means is a dedicated timer
in each pulsator and each dedicated timer is synchronised upon electrical start-up of the

milking machine.
