<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the non-linear
compression and expanding of video signals to better
facilitate application of video information to a
medium, which medium may be a storage medium or a
transmission medium. The invention also relates to
compression and expanding of video signals to minimize
distortion effects introduced by bandwidth compression
devices designed to minimize data to be transmitted or
stored in memory.When video signals or other signals are applied to
a transmission or storage system, the transmission or
storage system has the undesirable effect of
introducing noise into the signal. In a transmission
system or medium, the signal which is received is a
combination of the transmitted signal and noise
introduced by the process. In somewhat similar
fashion, the signal which is recovered from a storage
system is a combination of the signal which was applied
to the storage system and noise introduced by the
process. Various techniques for minimizing the effects
of such noise have been used for the storage and/or
transmission of different types of signals. Generally,
such techniques try to maintain the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) at a sufficiently high level that noise
will not be noticeable.One common technique to minimize noise problems
from transmission or storage is frequency domain signal
pre-emphasis applied to a signal prior to its
transmission or storage. This technique, which is
relatively common for audio signals and has also been
used for video signals, takes advantage of the fact
that the troublesome noise is usually at high
frequencies. The pre-emphasis is an entirely linear
method which may be accomplished purely with linear
filter operations. The technique relies on the fact
that the video signal contains lower amplitude high
frequency components than the amplitude of the lower
frequency components. The signal is first passed
through a filter whose transmission generally increases
with an increase in frequency and the output of the
filter is then subjected to the transmission or
storage. Thus, the higher frequencies of the signal
(audio, video, or other) are transmitted or stored at a
higher amplitude than would be without the pre-emphasis.
After recovery of the signal from
transmission or storage, the recovered signal is passed
through a de-emphasis linear filter which has the
opposite amplitude and phase characteristic from the
pre-emphasis linear filter. That is, the result of 
both filters in tandem is an amplitude response uniform
in amplitude and a linear
