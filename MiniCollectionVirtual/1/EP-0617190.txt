Device for fixing glazing on a supporting structure 
characterised in that it comprises for each glazing element 

(1) an assembly of fixing elements, each comprising a rigid 
rod (2) of which one end is connected to non-swivelling 

locking means on the said glazing (1) and the other end is 
connected to a swivel joint system by means of which it is 

attached to the said supporting structure with the 
possibility of angular clearance. 
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
said locking means comprise a facing stud (3) fitted in a 

bore (4) of the glazing element (1) through the outer face 
of the latter, the stud having on one side a threaded body 

(5) projecting over the inner face of the glazing (1) and 
adapted to receive a locking screw (6) on this face, and on 

the other side a tapped housing (7) adapted to receive a 
threaded end of the said rigid rod (2). 
Device according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
threaded end of the said rod (2) supports a counter-screw 

(8) adapted to be locked against the end of the said 
threaded body (5). 
Device according to claim 2 or 3 characterised in that 
the said facing stud (3) comprises towards the outside an 

enlarged head (9) supported on a correspondingly shaped 
bearing face (10) of the said bore (4) of the glazing 

element (1). 
Device according to claim 4 characterised in that a ring 
(11) of synthetic material is interposed between the said 

head (9) of the facing stud (3) and the said bearing (10) of 
the glazing element (1).  

 
Device according to any of claims 2 to 5 characterised 
in that the said locking means comprise furthermore a disc 

(12) of synthetic material interposed between the inner face 
of the glazing element (1) and the said locking screw (6). 
Device according to any of claims 2 to 6 of the type 
where the said glazing element (1) is double glazing 

(1a,1b), namely it comprises an outer panel of glass (1a) 
and an inner panel of glass (1b) characterised in that a 

cross-piece (13) is fitted on the said body (5) of the 
facing stud (3) so as to maintain the desired spacing 

between the two said glazing panels (1a,1b) level with the 
said locking means. 
Device according to claim 7 characterised in that a 
joint (14) enclosing the said cross-piece (13) is locked 

between the two said glazing panels (1a,1b). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said swivel system comprises at 

the said other end of the rigid rod (2), a spherical head 
(15) adapted to be held in swivel manner in a socket of 

complementary shape which is secured in a fixing member 
(16,16') fastened to the said supporting structure. 
Device according to claim 9 characterised in that the 
said fixing member comprises on one hand a tapped hole (17) 

whose base has a spherical bearing face (18) for the said 
head, and in which hole can be screwed a screw (19) having 

a spherical concave dome-shaped end (20) so as to be able to 
brake the rotation of the said spherical head (15) of the 

rod (2) or at least to regulate the play of same, and on the 
other hand a threaded body (21) adapted to traverse the 

opening (24) of a fixing plate (23) and to be locked there 
by means of the braking screw (22) fitted on the said body.  

 
Device according to claim 10 characterised in that a 
brake disc (25) is interposed between the said brake screw 

(22) and the said fixing plate (23). 
Device according to any of claims 9 to 11 characterised 
in that the said rigid rod (2) leaves the said fixing member 

(16,16') through a conical hole (26,26') enlarged towards 
the outside. 
Device according to claim 12 characterised in that the 
opening angle of the said conical hole is in the order of 

30Â°. 
Device according to any of claims 9 to 13 characterised 
in that a dust cover (28) is placed around the said rigid 

rod (2) in such a way as to rest against the said fixing 
member (16,16'). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said swivel systems are linked to 

the supporting structure either four by four by means of the 
fixing plates (23) in the form of cross arms, or two by two 

by means of the fixing plates (23') in the form of claws, 
these fixing plates being connected by the central part to 

the rigid connecting bars (27) attached to the said 
structure, or even individually. 
Device according to claim 15 characterised in that the 
said fixing members (16,16') of the swivel system are 

engaged in the holes (24) provided at the ends of the arms 
of the said cross arms (23) or claws (23') and in that at 

least some of these holes (24',24") have at least in a 
predetermined direction a dimension greater than the 

thickness of the corresponding fixing member (16,16').  
 
Device according to claim 16 characterised in that a 
fixing plate (23) in the form of a cross-arm with four arms 

comprises at the ends of these arms one hole (24) whose 
diameter is slightly larger than the thickness of the 

corresponding fixing member (16,16'), one hole (24') having 
in the horizontal direction a dimension significantly larger 

than the said thickness, one hole (24") whose diameter is 
significantly larger than the thickness of the corresponding 

fixing member (16,16') and finally one hole (24') having in 
the vertical direction a dimension significantly larger than 

the said thickness. 
Device according to claim 16 characterised in that a 
fixing plate (23') in the form of a claw with two arms 

comprises at the ends of these arms one hole (24) whose 
diameter is slightly larger than the thickness of the 

corresponding fixing member (16,16') and one hole (24') 
having in the horizontal or vertical direction a dimension 

significantly larger than the said thickness.
