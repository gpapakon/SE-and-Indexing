<ABSTRACT>
In a movable cleaning device (10) for textile machines, air conduits (16), to which air hoses (28) are connected, are provided. The air hoses are connected to the air conduits (16) via a rotary joint (22) and are movable from a first position into a second position. A rotary-drive device (44) is designed for rotating a rotary joint (20) beyond a pivoting movement.

Displaceable cleaning device for textile machines, in 
particular weaving machines, with a blower with air ducts 

(16, 18) attached thereto, onto which air tubes, in particular 
suction tubes are attached, which can be moved by a drive means 

relative to the air ducts via a joint (22), in such a way that 
the mouth of the air tubes (28) can be moved from a first 

position into a second position, characterised in that the 
drive means is formed such that it acts as a rotary 

drive means (44) for turning the joint beyond a pivot 
movement, whereby the rotary drive means (44) can be rotated 

continuously during the operation of the cleaning device (10) 
and a cleaning circuit each can be crossed by the air tubes 

(28). 
Cleaning device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the air tube (28) ends in a suction nozzle (40) which 

extends traverse to the direction of travel, whereby the 
suction nozzle (40), both in the first position, adjoining the 

row of textile machines, and in the second position, removed 
from the textile machines, extends traverse to the direction 

of travel of the cleaning device (10). 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterised in that the air duct (16, 18) extends traverse 
to the direction of travel of the cleaning device (10). 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the air tubes (28), relative to the row 

of textile machines, run outside of the joint (22) in their 
first position and inside the joint in their second position. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the drive means (44) acts on two air 

tubes which are separated from each other laterally to the 
textile machine, whereby both air tubes (28) can be moved 

synchronously. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that several different textile machines can 

be reached by the same cleaning device (10), whereby for each 
textile machine a control impulse transmitter is positioned 

along the cleaning device rail (10), via which the cleaning 
device (10) can be brought into the first, second or subsequent 

rotary positions of the air tubes (28). 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a transmitter for activating the drive 

means (44) before the displacement of the air tubes (28) from 
the first position into the second position, forms an obstacle 

sensor known per se, with which, by activating the drive means 
(44), any occasional obstacle lying in the vicinity of the 

rail laterally to the textile machine can be by-passed. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the junction between the air duct (16) 

and the air tube (28) is formed by a rotary joint (22), with a 
moving part (26) upon which the rotary drive means (44) acts. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterised in that the axis (34) of the air tube (28) 
opposite that of the end of the air duct (16) facing the air 

tube (28) is offset, in particular due to two bends (30,32) in 
the air tube (28) which are symmetrical to
 each other. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the rotary drive means (44) presents a 

positive locking rotary power transmission device, in 
particular a toothed belt (48), with which at least two air 

tubes (28) can be moved symmetrically and synchronously to one 
another. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a rotary drive means (44) for two air 

tubes (28) is provided such that the air tubes (28) can be 
rotated in the same direction. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a rotary drive means (44) for two air 

tubes (28) is provided such that the air tubes (28) can be 
rotated in opposite directions. 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the toothed belt (48) is positioned 

around a drive wheel (50) and a roller (52) in an S-shape, 
whereby in particular the spring-loaded roller (50) maintains 

constant bias on the toothed belt (58) of the rotary drive 
means (44). 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the rotary drive means (44) comprises a 

rotary joint (22), onto which the air tube is attached to the 
air duct (16), whereby the moving part (26) of the rotary 

joint (22) engages a fixed part of the rotary joint (22) via 
rolling bearings (56) and rests upon it.  

 
Cleaning device according to claim 13, characterised in 
that the rotary joint (22) presents merely a surrounding 

groove (54) for rolling bodies (56) and the bearing play can 
be adjusted in particular via a distance ring (62). 
Cleaning device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the air tubes (28) are rigid, and in 

particular flat nozzles (40), which in the first position 
extend out diagonally to the direction of travel of the 

cleaning device (100, are provided on the end of the air tubes 
(28) nearest to the ground. 
Cleaning device for textile machines, in particular 
spinning machines, with a blower with air ducts (16, 18) 

attached thereto, onto which air tubes (28), in particular 
suction tubes, are attached, which can be moved by a drive 

means with respect to the air ducts (16, 18) extending 
traverse to the direction of travel, such that the mouth of 

the air tubes (28) can be displaced from a first position into 
a second position, characterised in that the the drive means 

(44) is formed by a telescopic device with which the 
telescopical air duct (16), can be shortened or lengthened 

traverse to the direction of travel.
