<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a microswitch having a housing (1) which has a base (2), connecting contacts (10, 11, 12) projecting out of the base, which connecting contacts (10, 11, 12) can be sealed from the housing by means of a potting compound (13) and are provided with receptacles for the connection of electrical cables. Since, in the case of normal microswitches, the dimensions of the switch are enlarged as a result of the necessary seals by additional parts required for sealing, the object of the invention is to make available a microswitch for use in different environmental conditions using as many identical components as possible, without in so doing changing the structural size. This object is achieved in that the base has a trough-shaped depression (4), which is surrounded by walls on at least three sides, for accommodating the potting compound, by the connecting contacts each having a separating line running within the depression and being capable of being cut to length on this separating line, in such a manner that the remaining residue of the connecting contacts also ends within the depression, the remaining residue of the connecting contacts likewise having receptacles for the connection of electrical cables.

Microswitch having a housing (1) which has a 
base, the base (2,102) having projecting from it connection 

contacts (10,11,12), which can be sealed off from 
the housing by means of a potting compound (13) and are 

provided with receptacles for the connection of electrical 
leads, characterized in that the base (2; 102) has a 

trough-shaped depression (4; 104), which is surrounded by 
walls on at least three sides, for the purpose of receiving 

the potting compound (13), in that the connection 
contacts (10, 11 and 12) each have a separating line (4), 

which runs inside the depression (4), and can be cut to 
length at this separating line (34) in such a way that 

the remaining part of the connection contacts (110, 111 
and 112) ends whilst still inside the depression (104), 

the remaining part of the connection contacts (110, 111 
and 112) likewise having receptacles (50) for the connection 

of electrical leads (44, 45 and 46). 
Microswitch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the receptacles (50) in the remaining part of the 

connection contacts (110, 111 and 112) are designed as 
perforations (33), and the separating line (34) of the 

connection contacts (10, 11 and 12) runs through the 
perforations (33) with the result that after the connection 

contacts (10, 11 and 12) have been cut to length, 
upwardly open soldering receptacles (50) are produced 

into which the leads (44, 45 and 46) can be inserted from 
above and soldered. 
Microswitch according to Claim 2, characterized 

in that the perforations (33) have an essentially triangular 
design, with the result that after the connection  

 
contacts (10, 11 and 12) have been cut to length, soldering 

receptacles (50) having an essentially V-shaped 
design are produced. 
Microswitch according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the receptacle (50) for the connection of 

electrical leads (44, 45 and 46) is designed as an 
essentially bell-shaped perforation (33). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the separating line (34) of the 

connection contacts (10, 11 and 12) runs next to the 
perforations (33) offset towards the base (2; 102), with 

the result that a lateral cutout (39) is produced next to 
the perforations (33) and the soldering receptacle (50) 

produced during the cutting-to-length operation protrudes 
from the remaining part of the connection contacts (110, 

111 and 112). 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the receptacles (50) in a part of 

the connection contacts (110, 111) for the connection of 
the electrical leads (44, 45 and 46) are arranged such 

that they are laterally offset with respect to the 
longitudinal centre of the respective connection 

contacts. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the trough-shaped depression (104) 

is enclosed by walls only on three sides. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the housing (1; 101) has a two-part 

design formed from a cover (3) and the base (2; 102), it 
being possible for the cover (3) to be ultrasonically 

welded to the base (2; 102). 
Microswitch according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the cover (3) of the housing (1; 101) has an 

opening (16) and the base (2; 102) has a blind hole (19) 
which is flush with the opening (16), an externally 

operable switching plunger (17) being guided both through 
the blind hole and through the opening. 
Microswitch according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the switching plunger (17) is connected inside  

 
the housing (1; 101) to a forced opening lever (18) which 

presses directly on a movable switching contact (14) 
after a predetermined plunger travel. 
Microswitch according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that an externally operable switching 

plunger (17) projects from an opening (16) in the housing 
(1; 101), the opening (16) being surrounded, on the 

outside of the housing (1; 101), by an annular groove 
(20) into which can be inserted a rubber bellows (22) 

having a lower L-shaped edge (21) which is provided with 
a peripheral lip (23) pointing radially outwards, it also 

being possible for the outer groove edge (24) to be 
radially inwardly embossed by means of ultrasound, and 

the embossed groove edge (24) clamping the peripheral lip 
(23) in the groove (20) in a sealing manner.
