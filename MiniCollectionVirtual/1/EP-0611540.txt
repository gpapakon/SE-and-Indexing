A device for locking and unlocking a lid (2) on a bowl (1) to form a receptacle 
for cooking, preferably under pressure, the device comprising locking jaws (3) 

that are moveably mounted and spaced apart around the circumference of the 
receptacle, said jaws (3) being designed to occupy a position for locking the lid 

(2) relative to the bowl (1), and unlocking means (30) suitable for acting on the 
jaws (3) to make them leave the locking position, the device being 

characterized in that it includes: 

at least two jaws (3) mounted to move resiliently by the intermediary of 
return means (16) in a radial direction relative to the axis of symmetry (x-x') of 

the receptacle between a fixed, unlocking position against the return means 
(16), and a return position corresponding to the locking position, 
stop means (40) for holding the jaws (3) in the fixed position, said stop 
means being retractable to occupy a release position in which the jaws (3) are 

freely subjected to the action of the return means (16), and 
release means (30) suitable for acting on the stop means (40) to cause 
it to occupy its release position. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the jaws (3) extend over 
a fraction of the circumference of the receptacle each presenting, at least on a 

length segment (3'), a face (5) substantially parallel to the walls of the 
receptacle, said face being terminated by a first inwardly-directed rim (6) for 

bearing against the lid (2) or against the bowl (1) to enable locking. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the jaws (3) include 
respective second inwardly-directed rims (7) to define segments (3') of channel-shaped 

cross-section designed to encompass the lid (2) and the bowl (1). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that each jaw (3) is provided 
with two segments (3') of channel-shaped cross-section disposed at opposite 

ends of the jaw (3) and connected together by a link bar (8).  
 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the jaws 
are secured to the bowl (3). 
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the bowl (1) is provided 
with handles (4) with the jaws (3) being integrated therein. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that each 
jaw is mounted to move resiliently by the intermediary of resilient return means 

(16) preferably constituted by at least one compression spring (15) suitable for 
exerting a return force (F) on each jaw (3) tending to urge each jaw (3) towards 

the center of the receptacle. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
unlocking means include at least one control member (30) suitable for bringing 

the jaws (3) away from the locking position to cause them to occupy the fixed, 
unlocking position. 
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the control member (30) 
for each jaw (3) is constituted by a pushbutton (31) mounted to slide in a 

direction that is substantially normal to the displacement direction of the jaws 

(3), and possessing a wedge-shaped active bottom portion (31b) designed 
during sliding to engage a bracket (35) secured to the jaw (3) and push it 

radially outwardly relative to the receptacle. 
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the control member (30) 
is constituted by a lever (60) hinged on each jaw (3) at one end (61) and 

rotatably mounted to be actuated via its other end (64) so as to control radial 
displacement of each jaw (3). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that each  
 

jaw (3) is associated with stop means (40) comprising a retractable stop piece 
(41) mounted to move between a position in which it stops the jaws (3) and a 

release position. 
A device according to claim 11, characterized in that the stop piece (41) is 
mounted in a recess (42) to move in a direction that is substantially normal to 

the displacement direction of the jaws (3), which recess (42) is situated beneath 
the jaws (3) and has its opening lying in the same plane as the bottom of the 

jaws (3) so that when the jaws (3) are in the locking position, they overlie the 
stop piece (41) which is retracted into the recess (42), and when the jaws (3) 

are in the unlocking position they are in abutment against said stop piece (41). 
A device according to claim 12, characterized in that each stop piece (41) is 
resiliently mounted to move in its recess (42) against a spring (43) to take up its 

active position where part of the stop piece is outside the recess (42), in which 
position the stop piece (41) holds the jaw (3) in the unlocking position. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the 
release means is constituted by the lid (2) of the receptacle. 
A device according to claim 14, characterized in that the lid (2) has a curved 
peripheral edge (45) designed to engage the retractable stop (41) while the lid 

(2) is being closed. 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 15, characterized in that the 
first inwardly-directed rim (6) is curved with its concave side facing towards the 

bottom of the receptacle and forms the top rim of the jaw (3), said curvature 
being designed to co-operate in the locking position with a rolled edge (52) of 

complementary profile situated at the periphery of the lid. 
A device according to claim 16, characterized in that the lid of the bowl has  
 

a depression (55) in its central portion with the concave side thereof facing 
towards the outside of the receptacle. 
A device according to claim 17, characterized in that the depression (55) 
occupies 40% to 60% of the area of the lid (2). 
A device according to claim 17 or 18, characterized in that the lid (2) has an 
annular zone (54) connecting the central depression to a peripheral rolled 

portion (53) forming a groove extending from the rolled edge (52) and having its 
concave side facing towards the outside of the lid (2), said annular zone (54) 

having a curved cross-section whose concave side faces in the opposite 
direction of the central depression (55). 
A pressure cooker fitted with a device according to any one of claims 1 to 
19.
