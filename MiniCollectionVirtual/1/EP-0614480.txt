<ABSTRACT>
A latent image ink particularly for use in printing forms such as games or colouring books. An offset lithographic press is used for imprinting a substantially invisible image on a sheet of standard paper. The latent ink used to form the latent image is a mixture of potassium ferrocyanide or other suitable colour forming iron complexing compounds, white ink and varnish. A developing solution such as ferric chloride or ammonium sulfate is subsequently added to the paper to render the image visible.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LATENT IMAGE INKThis invention relates to printing inks, and more particularly to latent image inks used in producing games, colouring books, forms, and the like. Typically, such games and books include both visible and "invisible" images;the "development" of the latent image is at least in part an object of thegame.It is desirable to use conventional lithographic printing methods including oleoresinous inks, "wet" offset presses and standard grade offset paper in order to be able to manufacture games and the like at reasonable cost. Reusable games have been suggested. Manufacture of such games, however, could require more complex printing, developing and erasure techniques. Further, this might not be entirely cost effective, particularly if the game is usually discarded after use, for example during travel. Currently available children's game books (e.g. as disclosed in Lee, U.S. 3,826,449 and Lenkoff, U.S. 3,850,649) utilize a water-based printing ink for the printing of the latent image portions. Printing of each of the latent and visible images requires the use of different print methods. The games are printed in two passes on two different machines. Use of oleoresinous offset inks to print the latent image would be advantageous, in that both the latent and the visible images could be printed in one pass using a conventional two colour (or four colour) "wet" offset press. 

 Problems that may be encountered in the development of printed latent images include premature detection of the latent images ("clueing"), that is, when a distinction between background and latent print areas can be seen with the naked eye because of yellowing or different light reflectance of the ink and paper. Inadvertent development of latent ink images may also be caused by impurities in the ink by substances in the paper, bycontamination during the printing process, or by heating of the printed latent image during print drying.A further potential problem, is that of long development time for converting the colourless image to a coloured reaction product which is clearly visible. Development should preferably be relatively fast.Other problems not encountered in letter press printing must be overcome to provide a latent image ink suitable for high speed "wet" offset printing techniques.Canadian Patent No. 974,004 discusses the problems to be overcome in using offset presses without extensive modification. The ink vehicle and the colour-foi- -ing reactant preferably should be specifically adapted to conventional lithographic

colourless or light-coloured, water soluble, particulate colour forming organic or inorganic compound capable of forming a strongly coloured complex or compound when reacted with an appropriate agent
dispersed throughout the vehicle.
2. The latent image ink of Claim 1 where the colour forming compound is selected from one of the groups of pH indicator compounds, "redox" indicator compounds and metal ion complexing or reactant compounds.
3. The latent image ink of Claim 1 where the colour forming compound is selected from the group of compounds that complex or react with metal
ions.
4. The latent image ink of Claim 1 where the colour forming compound is selected from the group of compounds that complex or react with Fe*** ions.
5. The latent image ink of Claim 4 where the colour forming compound is potassium ferrocyanide. 


 6. The latent image ink of Claim 4 where the colour forming compound is tannic acid.
7. A printed form comprising: a standard grade offset paper carrying at least two images, one of which is a plurality of printed visible entries, printed with a conventional lithographic "wet" offset ink; and the other of which is a plurality of printed "invisible" entries â€¢ comprising latent images printed with a latent image ink comprising an oleoresinous lithographic vehicle, particulate potassium ferrocyanide or tannic acid dispersed in the vehicle, and conventional lithographic ink additives.
8. A kit comprising the printed form of Claim 7 and a means of applying a developing agent comprising an organic or inorganic ferric salt in a aqueous solution and optionally containing an evaporation inhibitor.
9. The developing agent of Claim 8 where the means of applying said
developing agent is a felt tip marking instrument.

 and the others of which comprising a plurality of printed invisible entries comprising latent images, said invisible entries comprising a plurality of individual deposits of at least two different latent image inks in adjacent and/or intermingling relationship, said plurality of individual deposits being optically unresolvable, each of said latent image inks comprising an oleoresinous lithographic vehicle, a particulate, water soluble, colourless or lightly coloured colour forming compound, and conventional lithographic additives, each of the said
latent image inks containing a different colour forming compound.
