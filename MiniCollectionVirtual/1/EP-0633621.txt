<ABSTRACT>
Antenna-filter combiners serve for connecting a multiplicity of frequency channels to a sending antenna. For simple construction with low-loss transmission filters, an arrangement is provided according to the invention having  mu  circulators connected in a waveguide leading to the antenna, and  mu  transmission channels are in each case fed into the respective third gate of the circulators via a frequency-separating filter consisting of  mu  
<
/= m partial filters connected together. In this case, the signal flow direction of the circulators is exploited so that the frequency channels already fed in at circulators 1...( beta -1) lying at positions in front along the course of the waveguide are at least approximately totally reflected at the frequency-separating filter of the  beta th circulator and are fed on towards the antenna via possible further circulators ( beta  + 1)...n connected to frequency-separating filters.
