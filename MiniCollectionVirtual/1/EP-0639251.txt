 DESCRIPTIONTube and Flange Coupling AssemblyFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention is directed generally to a coupling assembly. More specifically, the invention is directed to a coupling assembly having a flange and tubes in which the tubes have the ability to rotate within the flange.10BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coupling assemblies are known in the art. These prior art assemblies usually have tubes that are welded or brazed to a flange. This causes the tubes to be immovable once they are attached to the15 flange. This has resulted in many problems when the prior art coupling assemblies are used in conjunction with, for example, an automotive air conditioning compressor. Some of these problems include complex assembly, expensive and cumbersome packaging and difficulties in adjusting the compressor in an automobile because the2.0 tubes are fixed in place. The present invention solves the above problems by providing a simple and adjustable coupling assembly. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention includes a flange, at least one tube and a tube connection means. The flange has an outer surface and at least one inner surface. The inner surface defines at least one tube receiving opening. The inner surface also defines a flange groove. A tube connection means hole extends through the flange from the outer surface to the inner surface. The hole is in communication with the flange groove. The tube has an exterior surface. A groove is defined by the exterior surface. The tube is inserted in the tube receiving opening of the flange. The tube groove is aligned with the flange groove. A tube connection means, such as wire, is inserted in the tube connection means hole. The tube connection means mates the flange groove and the tube groove. This engagement retains the tube in the flange and also allows it to move within the flange. The primary object of the present invention is to provide a coupling assembly having tubes that can move with respect to a flange.An important object of the present invention is to provide a coupling assembly that is simple to manufacture and easy to package. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the invention is described hereinafter in detail with reference being made to the accompanying drawings.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an automotive air conditioning compressor with a prior art coupling assembly attached thereto;Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the present invention attached to an automotive air

9. The coupling assembly of claim 1 , wherein said exterior surface of said tube defines at least one O-ring receiving channel.
10. The coupling assembly of claim 9, wherein at least one O-ring is positioned in said O-ring receiving channel.
1 1 . The coupling assembly of claim 1 , wherein said tube connection means is wire.
12. The coupling assembly of claim 1 1 , wherein said wire mates said tube by at least partially encircling said flange groove and 



said tube groove whereby said tube is retained in said flange while said tube is free to rotate within said flange.
13. The coupling assembly of claim 11 , wherein said wire partially engages said flange groove and said tube groove whereby said tube is retained in said flange while said tube is free to rotate within said flange.

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
The invention as claimed is directed to a coupling assembly for use in conjunction with the automotive air conditioning compressor. The assembly includes, among other things, a flange, two tubes, and flexible wire tube connection means. The flange has an outer surface and two inner surfaces. The inner surfaces define two tube receiving openings and flange grooves. Each of the flange grooves are in communication with tube connection means holes that extend through the flange from the outer surface to the inner surfaces. The two tubes each have exterior surfaces that define tube grooves. When the tubes are inserted in the tube receiving openings of the flange, the tube grooves are aligned with the flange grooves. A flexible wire tube connection means having a drive portion and legs connects the flanges to the tubes. The legs of the tube connection means are inserted into the tube connection means holes of the flange. The legs encircle the flange grooves and the tube grooves. This allows the tubes to rotate freely within the flange.
The cited references of record fail to disclose the above-described features of the invention as well as a coupling for two tubes inserted into a flange, wherein a single wire member engages grooves on each tube member and the wire is inserted into a groove connection means hole on the flange which intersects grooves on the inner surface of the flange.
It is submitted that the claims of the application, as amended, are indeed novel and involve an inventive step when viewed by a person skilled in the art.
