<ABSTRACT>
A controller of an automatic transmission which allows 
to make a gear change favorably in any traveling condition 

and to always obtain the best gear change characteristics is 
provided. The controller of the automatic transmission of 

the present invention comprises input torque determining 
means 41 for determining an input torque input to the 

transmission, inertia torque estimating means 42 for 
estimating an inertia torque corresponding to a varying 

speed of number of revolutions of a rotary member during 
gear change, input torque correcting means 43 for 

calculating a required operating torque by adding the input 
torque with the inertia torque and operating pressure 

control means 44 for controlling an operating pressure by 
corresponding to the required operating torque. Because the 

operating pressure corresponding to the necessary engagement 
torque is generated in the hydraulic servo 51, the operating 

pressure necessary for gear change can be generated in the 
hydraulic servo 51 no matter how a throttle opening and 

driving speed may be or the gear change is made step by step 
or jumped gear change is made, thus allowing to make a gear 

change favorably in any traveling condition and to always 
obtain the best gear change characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a controller of an 
automatic transmission. Conventionally, an automatic transmission has a gear 
box comprising a gear train and is constructed so as to 
transmit revolutions to a certain gear element in the gear 
train and to take out the revolutions from another gear 
element. To that end, a plurality of frictional engage 
elements such as a clutch and brake are provided to 
selectively transmit the revolutions among each of the gear 
elements by engaging and disengaging the frictional engage 
elements to provide gear change steps corresponding to 
combinations of the gear elements. In a case of a hydraulic control automatic 
transmission, each of the frictional engage elements has a 
corresponding hydraulic servo. For example, the gear change 
can be made to a certain gear change step by newly supplying 
oil to a hydraulic servo to which no oil has been supplied 
to engage its frictional engage element and by discharging 
oil from a hydraulic servo to which oil has been supplied to 
release its frictional engage element.  By the way, if oil is abruptly supplied to the 
hydraulic servo, the frictional engage element is also 
abruptly engaged along that, thereby causing a gear change 
shock. Then the gear change shock is reduced by supplying 
oil to the hydraulic servo by giving an appropriate 
transient characteristic to it. A gear change shock caused by an excessive or deficient 
operating pressure may be also reduced and a life of the 
frictional engage elements be prolonged by governing a line 
pressure corresponding to an input torque input to the 
transmission. Then there has been provided a prior art 
automatic transmission which estimates an input torque 
corresponding to a fuel injection pulse for controlling an 
engine and to an engine speed and governs a line pressure 
corresponding to the input torque to adjust an operating 
pressure of a hydraulic servo to an adequate value 
(hereinafter referred to as "the first prior art automatic 
transmission". See Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 1-116363.)
 
   Also another prior art automatic transmission has been 
provided which governs a line pressure so that a gear change 
time agrees with its targeted value, corresponding to 
frictional engage elements, an elapsed deterioration of oil 
and others and fluctuations in production (hereinafter 
referred to as "the second prior art automatic  
 
transmission". See Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 2-31069.)
 
   Still another prior art automatic transmission has
