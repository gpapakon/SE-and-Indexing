<ABSTRACT>
In a fuel bundle for use in the core of a boiling 
water nuclear reactor, part length rods having a tendency to 

reduce pressure drop are used in combination with spacers and 
spacer attached devices tending to utilize pressure drop to 

improve critical power. The addition of the part length rods 
has the advantage of lowering the pressure drop. Attached 

devices substantially increase the pressure drop. Exemplary 
spacer attached mechanisms for the utilization of pressure drop 

are set forth including vanes - preferably swirl vanes on the 
spacers, decreasing the spacer pitch to increase the total 

number of spacers in the upper two phase region of the fuel 
bundle, increasing the vertical height of the spacers, and 

increasing the thickness of the metal from which the spacers 
are constructed. Two classes of separation devices are 

disclosed for placement in the volume overlying the end of the 
partial length fuel rods. A first type of device fits to the 

end of the part length rods and is primarily intended for 
preventing water passing along the surface of the part length 

rod adjacent the end of the part length rod from entering the 
volume overlying the part length fuel rod. A second type of 

device resides in the volume overlying the part length rod. In 
either case, critical power is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure relates to nuclear fuel bundles 
utilized in boiling water nuclear reactors In U.S. Patent 5,112,570 a fuel bundle having a plurality 
of part length rods was illustrated. A summary of that construction 
and the advantages set forth in this reference can be 
instructive. Construction of the fuel bundle in Dix et al. is 
conventional with the exception of the addition of less than 
full length fuel rods. The conventional portion of the 
disclosed fuel assembly in the Dix et al. Patent is easy to 
understand. This assembly includes a channel having vertically 
extending walls for extending around a fuel bundle assembly 
volume. The channel is open at the bottom for receipt of water 
moderator and open at the top for the discharge of water and 
steam. The fuel bundle includes a matrix of vertically 
upstanding fuel rods -- these rods being sealed tubes 
containing fissionable materials. The fuel rods are supported 
on a lower tie plate which permits the entry of the water 
moderator to the fuel bundle. The fuel rods typically extend  
 
to an upper tie plate which maintains the fuel rods in their 
side by side vertical relation and permits the generated steam 
and remaining water to escape. The Dix et al. disclosure adds to the conventional 
fuel assembly, a plurality of less than full length spaced 
apart so-called "part length (fuel) rods" (PLRs). These fuel 
rods are supported on the lower tie plate, extend upwardly to 
and toward the upper tie plate, but terminate short of the 
upper tie plate. Between the point of part length fuel rod 
termination and the upper tie plate, the part length fuel rod 
defines in the upper two phase region of the fuel bundle a vent 
volume. This vent volume preferentially receives vapor from 
the liquid vapor two phase mixture in the upper two phase 
region of the fuel bundle during power producing operation. Numerous advantages result from the part length rod 
construction. Improved cold shut down margin enables fuel to 
be designed with reduced amounts of burnable absorbers such as 
gadolinium. The tendency of the fuel bundle in the reactor to 
produce plutonium at the top of the bundle from resonance 
neutron capture in uranium 238 is reduced. The void overlying 
the part length rod has an increased vapor fraction with the 
result that the full length rods adjacent the voids have an 
increased liquid fraction. Further, the pressure drop in the 
upper two phase region of the fuel bundle is reduced. This 
being the case, the fuel bundle enjoys increased
