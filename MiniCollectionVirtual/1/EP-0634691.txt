<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for making direct 
positive photographic images by developing light-sensitive materials 

in the presence of development nucleators which do not cause loss of 
sensitivity during exposure or unevenness of development. More 

specifically the invention relates to the formation of direct-positive 
images having a high maximum density and high exposure 

latitude and to photographic materials for use in said formation, 
which is accomplished by a method for making direct-positive images 

comprising: 

image-wise exposing a photographic light-sensitive silver halide 
material comprising a support and a layer of an internal latent 

image-type silver halide emulsion, the pAg of which has been 
adjusted to a pAg-value between 9.0 and 10.5 inclusive before 

coating, and 
developing said exposed photographic silver halide material in a 
surface developer in the presence of a development nucleator with a 

group promoting adsorption to silver halide. 
It has been found that in a particular embodiment of this 
invention a development-nucleating amount of a hydrazine compound 

with a 7-hydroxy-s-triazolo-[1,5-a]-pyrimidine group as group 

promoting adsorption to silver halide is very useful.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making direct
positive photographic images by developing light-sensitive materials
in the presence of development nucleators which do not cause loss of
sensitivity during exposure or unevenness of development. More
specifically the invention relates to the formation of direct-positive
images having a high maximum density and high exposure
latitude and to photographic materials for use in said formation.In silver halide photography a photographic method, according to
which a positive image is made without the use of a negative image
or an intermediary process producing a negative image, is called a
direct-positive method and a photographic light-sensitive element
and a photographic emulsion for use according to such direct-positive
method are called direct-positive element and direct-positive
emulsion respectively.A variety of direct-positive photographic methods are known.
The most useful methods are the method, which comprises exposing
prefogged silver halide grains to light in the presence of a
desensitizing agent and developing them and the method, which
comprises subjecting a silver halide emulsion that has light-sensitive
specks mainly inside the grains to an image-wise exposure
and developing the exposed emulsion in the presence of a development
nucleator. The present invention relates to the latter method.A silver halide emulsion comprising light-sensitive specks
mainly inside the grains and which forms latent images mainly inside
the grains is referred to as internal latent image-type silver
halide emulsion, and thus is distinguished from silver halide grains
that form latent images mainly at the surface of the grains.It is known to develop a latent image that has been formed
mainly inside the grains by means of a so-called internal developer,
but the method, material and emulsions used in accordance with the
present invention are not concerned with that type of development,
but rather with the type of development using a so-called surface
developer. Methods for making a direct-positive image by development of
an exposed internal latent image type-silver halide emulsion in the
presence of a development nucleator by means of a surface developer,
and photographic emulsions and photographic light-sensitive
materials used in such methods have been disclosed in i.a. GB-A
