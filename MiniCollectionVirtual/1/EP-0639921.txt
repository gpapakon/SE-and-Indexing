<ABSTRACT>
Deflection apparatus for a raster scanned cathode ray tube display 
comprises a ramp generator (210) for producing a current ramp signal 

synchronised to a raster synchronisation signal. A ramp regulator (230) 
is connected to the generator (210) for varying the amplitude of the scan 

signal as a function of the difference between a reference input and a 
feedback signal. A feedback circuit (220) connected to the generator 

(210) and to the regulator (230) for generating the feedback signal as a 
function of the amplitude and frequency of the line scan signal. A 

multiplier (250) is connected to the regulator and for varying the 
reference input as a function of an integer multiple of the frequency of 

the raster synchronisation signal. Any scan signal frequency component in 
the feedback signal is cancelled at the input to the regulator by 

introducing, via the multiplier (250), a scan signal frequency component 
to the reference input. Because the displayed picture size is thus made 

independent of scan signal frequency, the deflection apparatus can 
maintain a constant picture size despite variations in scanning signal 

frequency without the bandwidth limitations of the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to deflection apparatus for enabling 
a raster scanned CRT display to maintain a constant picture size despite 
variations in raster line scanning frequency. Many raster scanned CRT displays are now designed to be compatible 
with a wide range of computer systems each capable of generating one or 
more different raster display formats. Each raster display format is 
generally characterised by a different pair of line and frame scanning 
frequencies. A conventional line scan circuit for driving the horizontal 
deflection coils for a CRT display comprises a ramp generator for 
producing a line scan current signal in the deflection coils in 
synchronisation with a raster line synchronisation (sync) signal 
generated by the host computer. The amplitude of the line scan signal is 
inversely proportional to the frequency of the line sync signal. 
Therefore, the width of the picture displayed on the CRT screen is 
inversely proportional to the frequency of the line sync signal. In conventional CRT displays that are capable of displaying 
different raster display formats, a ramp regulator is connected to the 
ramp generator to reduce the effect of changes in line sync signal 
frequency on displayed picture width by varying the amplitude of the line 
scan signal as a function of a reference input and a feedback signal. The 
feedback signal is generated as a function of the line scan signal by a 
feedback circuit connected to the ramp generator and the regulator. The 
feedback circuit conventionally comprises a low pass filter with a time 
constant that is long enough to remove the line scan frequency component 
from the feedback signal. The low pass filter therefore limits the range 
of line scan frequencies within which the display can operate with 
constant picture width. Furthermore, increasing the time constant of the 
filter increases the transient response time of the regulator when 
switching between different display formats. A deflection apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 1 
is known from EP-A-0 398 598. In accordance with the present invention, there is now provided 
deflection apparatus for a raster scanned cathode ray tube display, the 
apparatus comprising: a ramp generator for receiving a raster 
synchronisation signal and for producing a raster scan signal  
 
synchronized to the raster synchronisation signal; a reference source for 
generating a reference input; a ramp regulator connected to the generator 
for varying the amplitude of the scan signal as a
