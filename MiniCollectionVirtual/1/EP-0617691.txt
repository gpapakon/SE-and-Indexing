A process for transporting objects along a circuit, 
wherein each object is placed upon a transport pallet (4) and the 

pallets are moved in steps along the circuit (5, 6, 8, 11, 13) to 
pass in succession through a first work station (1) where the 

objects are separated by a first longitudinal interval (e) and at 
least one second work station (2, 3) where the objects are 

separated by a second longitudinal interval (E), larger than the 
first interval, said method comprising the step of separating the 

objects between the first and the second work stations, 
characterized in that said first spacing is defined by a first 

interval between pallets and said second spacing is defined by a 
second interval (X) between pallets, larger than the first, and 

in that during the separation phase, one group of pallets (29, 
30, 31, 32, 34) separated by the first interval is transversely 

displaced and the pallets in this group are longitudinally 
separated to form the second interval between them, and the 

pallets thus spaced are then introduced into the second work 
station. 
A process according to claim 1 characterized in that 
said first interval is nil and the pallets are adjacent. 
A process according to claim 1 characterized in that 
said transverse displacement consists of horizontal displacement 

between two parallel sections of track (5, 6).  
 
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3 characterized in 
that after the second work station that pallets are moved 

together to reestablish the first spacing interval. 
A method according to claim 1 characterized that in the 
first instance the pallets in said group are transversely 

displaced and in the second instance, these pallets are 
separated, forming the second interval, with these two operations 

occurring simultaneously in two adjacent groups. 
A method according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
pallets in said group are transversely displaced and 

longitudinally separated to form said second interval, with these 
two operations occurring simultaneously. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said objects are thermoplastic preforms (20) for the 

manufacture of blow-molded containers (33), characterized in that 
the second work station (2) is a blow-molding station and the 

first work station (1) is a preheating station to prepare for 
molding. 
A device for moving objects along a circuit using the 
method of claim 1, consisting of transport pallets (4) arranged 

in a line on sections of track (5, 6, 8) forming at least one 
portion of said circuit and successively passing through a 

loading station (9) where each object (20) is placed upon a 
pallet, a first work station (1), at least one second work 

station (2) where the objects are treated in groups, and a 
discharge station (3) where the objects are removed from the  

 
pallets; at the first work station the objects are separated by a 

first longitudinal interval (e) and at the second work station, 
by a second longitudinal interval (E) greater than the first 

interval, said device comprising drive means (12, 14, 25) 
advancing the pallets in steps along the track sections, and 

characterized in that the first space (e) is defined by a first 
interval between pallets and the second space (E) is defined by a 

second interval (X) between pallets, larger than the first, and 
in that the device further comprises a transfer station (7) which 

displaces a group of pallets (29, 30, 31, 32, 34) between a first 
and a second section of track (5, 6) transversely separated from 

each other, and in that said transfer station (7) comprises 
engaging means (21, 22, 23, 50-55) which longitudinally separate 

the pallets in a group to create said second interval between 
them. 
A process according to claim 8 characterized in that 

said first interval is nil, the pallets being adjacent on said 
first section of track (5). 
A device according to claim 8 characterized in that the 
first and the second section of track (5, 6) are parallel and at 

the same level at the transfer station (7), the pallets being 
transferred horizontally between them. 
A device according to claim 10 characterized in that 
the transfer station comprises a transverse ram (17) which is 

applied laterally to a group of pallets aligned with the first  
 

section of track (5) and displaces this group toward the second 
section of track (6). 
A device according to claim 11 characterized in that 
the separation means consist of movable separating elements (22, 

23) which each engage with one pallet in a group aligned with the 
second section of track (6), and a separating mechanism (52-55) 

which displaces the engaging means individually and 
longitudinally toward the second section of track (6), along a 

course which is respectively proportionate to the distance 
between each engaging element (22, 23) and a reference point 

(21). 
A device according to claim 8 characterized in that the 
drive means consists of at least two longitudinal comb mechanisms 

(26, 27) disposed along the second section of track (6), each 
comb mechanism engaging with a group of pallets (29, 30, 31) to 

drive it to the transfer station (7) at the second work station 
(2), and thereafter to the discharge station (3) both comb 

mechanisms being displaced synchronously. 
A device according to claim 10 characterized in that 
the circuit comprises a return track (8) which is parallel to the 

first and second track sections (5, 6), but on a lower level, and 
in that the loading station (9) and a receiving station (15) 

which receives objects removed from the pallets are disposed 
above said return track (8). 
A device according to claim 14 characterized in that 
the first and the second sections of track (5, 6) are connected  

 
to the return track (8) by transfer trolleys (11, 13) which each 

transport a group of pallets comprising the same number of 
pallets as are in the groups treated at the transfer station (7). 
The use of the device according to claim 8 to move 
preforms (20) in a plant manufacturing blow-molded thermoplastic 

containers.
