<ABSTRACT>
To provide a simple immunochemical assay of a 
PIVKA of every kind (PIVKA-VII, -IX, -X, -C, -S or -Z; 

protein induced by vitamin K absence) corresponding to 
a vitamin K-dependent protein. It has been confirmed 

that a PIVKA of every kind can be determined according 
to the double antibody sandwich method wherein use is 

made of a solid-supported anti-PIVKA-II monoclonal 
antibody. There is also disclosed a reagent for 

determination of a PIVKA of every kind according to 
the above-mentioned method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
immunochemical assay for determining the presence of a PIVKA 
in a biological specimen and a reagent therefor, which are utilized 
in the medical field. Vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins present in 
organisms include prothrombin, factor VII, factor IX, 
factor X, protein C, protein S, and protein Z. 
According to the biosynthesis mechanisms of these 
proteins, a precursor protein is carboxylated at the 
γ-positions of about 10 glutamic acid residues thereof 
in the presence of vitamin K and a carboxylase to be 
converted into an active-form normal protein, which 
manifests the physiological action thereof. These 
glutamic acid residues are present in the N-terminal 
region, which is referred to as the "Gla region." In 
a state of physiological or clinical deficiency of 
vitamin K or in a state of suppressed action of 
vitamin K through administration of a vitamin K 
antagonist, proteins with incomplete carboxylation of 
those glutamic acid residues are formed.  
 
"PIVKA" is a generic term for those vitamin 
K-dependent plasma proteins with such incomplete 
carboxylation, and is an abbreviation of "Protein 
Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist." The 
number of noncarboxylated residues among the about 10 
glutamic acid residues present in the amino-terminal 
region is not fixed. Thus, one kind of protein is 
composed of several kinds of PIVKA compounds present 
in mixture. The PIVKA can also be said to be a protein 
wherein some γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues of the 
normal vitamin K-dependent plasma protein are 
descarboxylated. PIVKAs corresponding to the above-enumerated 
vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins are 
referred to as PIVKA-II, PIVKA-VII, PIVKA-IX, PIVKA-X, 
PIVKA-C, PIVKA-S, and PIVKA-Z, respectively. The 
PIVKA-II is a PIVKA of prothrombin. Clinical usefulness of determination of a PIVKA 
of every kind lies in that the PIVKA is produced in 
blood as a result of the above-mentioned incomplete 
γ-carboxylation in a state of vitamin K deficiency or 
suppression. Thus, the determination of the PIVKA as 
a marker of the state of vitamin K deficiency or 
suppression is of clinical importance. It has 
recently been found out that various PIVKAs are  
 
produced in blood as a result of hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Since PIVKA-II is very often produced in 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are 
negative for α-fetoprotein, which has been believed to 
be a good marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, it is 
recognized that clinical usefulness of
