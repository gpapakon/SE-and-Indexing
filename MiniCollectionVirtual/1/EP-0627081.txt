<ABSTRACT>
For the determination of antibodies (Ak), in particular of autoantibodies, such as human autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (hTPO), a procedure is adopted in which the antibodies to be determined are bound to a solid or undissolved phase in a conventional manner using unspecific binders and are then selectively labelled, for a subsequent measurement, by reaction with a crude antigen preparation (Ag) and a further, labelled antibody or antibody fragment (F(AK)*) which are specific for the antigen but are not bound, or not significantly bound, by the binder. The presence of the antibodies (AK) to be determined manifests itself in the form of a label bound to the solid or undissolved phase, the amount of said label being proportional to the amount of the antibodies to be determined in the sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an immunological assay method 
for the determination of autoantibodies, the detection 
of which permits the diagnosis of an autoimmune 
disease. Immunological assay methods in many variants play a 
very important role in medical diagnostics. In 
addition to those assay methods which aim at the 
qualitative and/or quantitative determination of 
antigens or haptens, for example hormones, there are 
also many such assay methods for the determination of 
antibodies in biological fluids, in particular human 
sera.  
 Antibodies are proteins which are referred to as 
immunoglobulins (Ig) and which are formed by the body 
as a reaction to an antigen. Since antigens normally 
have a large number of antigenic determinants, 
antibodies are of a polyclonal nature and thus 
represent a population of proteins having different 
binding properties with respect to the antigen against 
which they are directed. They are normally formed 
against exogenous antigens in order to protect the body 
from substances which have corresponding antigenic 
determinants. However, if the immune system of the 
body incorrectly recognises certain endogenous cells or 
cell structures as exogenous, it is also possible for 
antibodies to be formed against antigen determinants of 
endogenous elements. Such endogenous elements are then 
referred to as autoantigens, and the antibodies formed 
against them are referred to as autoantibodies. Known assay methods for antibodies realise various 
basic principles in one form or another, two of which 
are shown schematically, for example, at the top of 
column 3 in U.S. Patent B1 3 654 090. In a variant 
which corresponds to the classical radioimmunoassay 
(RIA), less than the required amount of an immobilised 
antigen is used, and a labelled form of the antibody to 
be determined is added in a known amount to the sample 
to be investigated. From the degree of binding of the 
labelled antibody to the immobilised antigen, it is 
possible to obtain information about the presence or 
concentration of the relevant antibody. For this test 
operating according to the competition principle, the 
antigen is required in very pure form. In a procedure based on a second principle, a known  
 
amount of the antibody to be determined or of a 
suitable derivative thereof is immobilised on a solid 
substrate, and the antibody present in the sample to be 
investigated and the immobilised antibody are then 
allowed to compete for a labelled antigen added to the 
reaction system. The presence

Immunological assay method for the 
determination of autoantibodies (Ak) in biological fluids, 

in which the biological fluid is reacted with 

a) an unspecific binder for antibodies of the type 
of the antibodies to be determined, said binder 

being insoluble in the reaction mixture or 
bound to a solid phase or microsolid phase, 
b) an antigen (Ag) for the antibodies (Ak) to be 
determined, and 
c) a selective labelling reagent in the form of an 
antibody or a fragment of an antibody (F(Ak)*) 

having a detectable label and binding 
specifically to the antigen (Ag), 
 
and in which the solid or undissolved phase is 

subsequently separated from the liquid phase and the 
presence or amount of the antibody (Ak) to be 

determined in the biological fluid is detected by means 
of the amount of labelled antibody or labelled fragment 

of the antibody (F(Ak)*) indirectly bound to the solid 
or undissolved phase via the unspecific binder, and the 

presence or the amount of the antibodies to be 
determined in the biological sample is then determined 

by qualitative estimation or by computational 
evaluation of the results obtained, using calibration 

curves, characterized in that,
 
in order to determine human autoantibodies

autoimmune disease, the antigen (Ag) is used as a crude 

autoantigen preparation, and wherein, as selective 
labelling reagent, a labelled monoclonal antibody or a 

labelled fragment of a monoclonal antibody (F(Ak)*) are 
used, which are not bound, or not significantly bound, 

by the unspecific binder and which bind to such region  
 

of the antigen (Ag), which is not recognized by the 
autoantibody (Ak) to be determined and which is not
