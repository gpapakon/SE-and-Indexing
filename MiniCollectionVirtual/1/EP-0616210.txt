<ABSTRACT>
A flow cell for calorimetric measurements comprises a body (2) with at least one flow 
channel (3), which extends between an inlet opening (4) and an outlet opening (5), and a 

thermoelectric detector (16) for monitoring temperature changes, which occur during 
chemical or biochemical processes in a measuring volume (17). The measuring volume 

(17) is arranged in close vicinity of the outlet opening (5). The body (2) of the flow cell (1) 
has a good thermal conductivity of a magnitude such, that a fluid flowing through the flow 

channel (3) is thermostatizised prior to entering the measuring volume (17) solely by 
flowing through the flow channel (3) and free of any external thermostatization means. 

Thus, a flow cell is provided, which is capable of self-thermostatizing a fluid flowing 
therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flow cell for calorimetric measurements according to the 
precharacterizing clause of claim 1. In Chemistry the recording of thermal events is a well known and established technique 
and calorimetric measurements for the detection of the heat of chemical or biochemical 
reactions have become a technique of increasing importance. It opens a very broad range 
of applications both for analytical purposes in fields, such as, for example, clinical, 
environmental and bioprocess monitoring, and for the biological study of living cells and 
organisms. Traditional calorimeters, which are used for such calorimetric measurements, 
were developed some 30 years ago. They rely on very well isolated vessels and accurate 
temperature regulation thanks to voluminous thermostatted baths and heat exchanger coils. 
Since that time, there has been a progressive appearance of new, less tedious and time 
consuming calorimetric measuring methods, which are based on smaller, sometimes 
miniaturized devices dedicated for flow-through systems and allowing a continuous and 
automated monitoring of various processes. Regarding the thermal detection of chemical 
and biochemical processes two principal approaches can be distinguished, which strongly 
affect the instrumentation involved. The first approach uses calorimeters, which are based on the quasi-adiabaticity of the 
thermal process. In these calorimeters heat exchanges between the vessel, usually a 
Dewar vessel, where the reaction takes place, and the external environment must be 
minimized. From this demand there results the need for vessels with a large internal 
volume of 10 cm³ and more , for an excellent thermal insulation, for a differential 
arrangement and/or for an accurate compensation of the heat losses with these 
calorimeters. Such, an estimated amount of about 50% to 80% of the heat, which is 
produced in the examined chemical or biochemical process, contributes to the detected 
and recorded temperature change ΔT.  From the prior art there are known so-called "enthalpimetric flow reactors", which work 
according to this first principle approach, and which are based on immobilized enzymes or 
microorganisms. In these devices the reaction vessel is replaced by a reactor column, that 
is packed with with matrix-bound enzyme on a carrier substrate, where the chemical or 
biochemical reaction takes place. Although offering excellent performances, such as, for 
example, a temperature resolution of about 10⁻⁵ K, these devices suffer from
