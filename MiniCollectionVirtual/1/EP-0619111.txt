<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to hair fixative compositions that are prepared from polyurethanes containing pendant free
carboxyl groups that are neutralized with standard cosmetically acceptable bases.Most hair fixative compositions contain a film-forming polymer, which acts as the fixative, and a delivery system,
which is usually an alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and water. In the case of aerosol delivery, the delivery system will
also contain a propellant, which is typically a volatile hydrocarbon. Due to environmental regulations controlling the
emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere, these alcohol and hydrocarbon delivery systems
are becoming less acceptable, and it is foreseen that water will become a greater component in hair fixative compositions.
However, many hair fixative polymers in current use exhibit a loss of performance properties in aqueous based
systems; for example, the solution viscosity increases, and if delivered by aerosol, the composition foams at the valve
actuator and on the hair. These factors have prompted the search for hair fixative polymers that are soluble in aqueous
or in low VOC systems, which are systems that contain 80% or less VOCs, and that perform with all the desired characteristics
of a good hair fixative polymer, namely, good holding power, high humidity curt retention, quick drying time,
nonstickiness, and a clear, transparent, glossy film that is easily removable with water or with water and shampoo.This invention is an aqueous based hair fixative composition that comprises an effective amount of a polyurethane
to perform as a hair fixative in an all water or in an alcohol-water solvent system. Specifically, the hair fixative composition
comprises (A) an effective amount of a fully reacted carboxylated linear polyurethane comprising the reaction product
of (i) one or more 2,2-hydroxymethyl-substituted carboxylic acids present in an amount to give 0.35-2.25
milliequivafents of carboxyl functionality per gram of polyurethane, (ii) 10-90% by weight, based on the weight of the
polyurethane, of one or more organic compounds having no more than two active hydrogen atoms each, and (iii) one
or more organic diisocyanates selected from the group consisting of methylenedi-p-phenyl diisocyanate and methylene-bis-(4 cyclohexylisocyanate) present in a sufficient amount to react with the active hydrogens of the 2,2-hydroxymethyl-substituted
carboxylic acids and the organic compounds, excepting the hydrogen on the carboxylate of the
