<ABSTRACT>
A synchronization adder circuit for digital data communication 
is provided. This circuit includes an A/D converter, a waveform-shaping 

circuit, a square circuit, a low-pass filter, and an adder. 
The A/D converter samples at given sampling points in time per 

sampling cycle a received signal transmitted through a plurality of 
subcarriers to digitize sampled values to provide digital signals. The 

waveform-shaping circuit then waveform-shapes the digital signals 
from said A/D converter without decomposing them with respect to 

each subcarrier. The square circuit squares the output signals from 
the waveform-shaping circuit. The low-pass filter removes a given 

high-frequency component from output signals from the square 
circuit. The adder adds values of output signals from the low-pass 

filter at each sampling point for preselected sampling cycles to 
determine the samples suitable for reproduction of original data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a synchronization
adder circuit which may be employed in a receiver of a digital
communication system to synchronously add the power of sampled
received signals, and more particularly to such a synchronization
adder circuit having an improved compact structure.In a known digital communication system, a receiver samples
signal levels of a received signal at time intervals corresponding to
transmission intervals at which a transmitter transmits symbols (1,
0), and compares them with a threshold value to reproduce original
symbols.For transmission of digital data in a narrow band, the Nyquist
characteristic is generally used. The same filter having the root
Nyquist properties is usually employed both in transmitter and
receiver. In such digital transmission, the sampling timing where a
symbol is sampled from a received signal can be determined based
on a maximum point of the envelope of the received signal unless a
limiter amplifier is used as a receiver amplifier.The receiver digitizes the received signal at a sampling
frequency that is an integral multiple (N) of a symbol-clock
frequency, synchronously adds a square mean of samples at Nth
sample points in time, and then identifies the samples at the Nth 
sample points having a maximum square means as indicating
transmitted symbols.In order to enhancing the communication efficiency, known
digital communication usually uses a plurality of subcarriers whose
carrier frequencies are gradually shifted from the center frequency
for transmitting a great deal of data. It is possible to improve the
detection ability of symbol-timing (i.e., the symbol-clock frequency)
by using the sum of the envelopes of the subcarriers.Fig. 5 shows a conventional synchronization adder circuit
which includes generally A/D converters 21 and 22, frequency
converters 31, 32, 33, and 34, waveform-shaping filters 51, 52, 53,
54, 55, 56, 57, and 58, square circuits 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,
and 78, an adder 81, an adder circuit 82, a memory 83, and a
discrimination point detecting circuit 84.The A/D converter 21 digitizes the same phase component 11
(I signal) of a received signal on each subcarrier at a sampling
frequency of N times a symbol-clock frequency. The A/D converter
22 digitizes at the same sampling frequency an orthogonal
component 12 (Q signal) of the received signal on each subcarrier.
The frequency converters 31 to 34 frequency-convert the digital
signals 23 and 24 on each subcarrier outputted from the A/D
converters 21 and 22
