<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for continuously and rapidly forming trays of 
highly uniform elastomeric soil plugs comprises means for 

continuously mixing a water-containing soil slurry with a 
water-reactive pre-polymer compound, means for supplying 

the soil slurry and the pre-polymer compound to the mixing 
means at respective controlled rates, and means for deliver­

ing the mixed soil slurry and pre-polymer compound to a 
dispensing station for dispensing into mold receptacles; the 

receptacles are disposed in a closed path and carried by 
transport means seriatim past the dispensing station. Releas­

able bias means biases a tray mold member against a base 
mold member within each receptacle so as to extrude 

soil-pre-polymer mixture into plug-molding cavities of the 
tray mold member. The bias means is released after the 

plugs within the tray mold member have cured. The 
operation of the apparatus coordinates the various steps in 

the plug-molding process with stages of the chemical 
reaction between the water and pre-polymer compound to 

form highly uniform plugs at the maximum rate allowable by 
the chemical reaction.
