<ABSTRACT>
Hydrogels of polymerized and crosslinked macromers comprising hydrophilic oligomers having biodegradable monomeric or oligomeric extensions, which biodegradable extensions are terminated on free ends with end cap monomers or oligomers capable of polymerization and cross linking are described. The hydrophilic core itself may be degradable, thus combining the core and extension functions. Macromers are polymerized using free radical initiators under the influence of long wavelength ultraviolet light, visible light excitation or thermal energy. Biodegradation occurs at the linkages within the extension oligomers and results in fragments which are non-toxic and easily removed from the body. Preferred applications for the hydrogels include prevention of adhesion formation after surgical procedures, controlled release of drugs and other bioactive species, temporary protection or separation of tissue surfaces, adhering of sealing tissues together, and preventing the attachment of cells to tissue surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
photopolymerizable biodegradable hydrogels for use as
tissue adhesives and in controlled drug delivery.Biodegradable hydrogels can be carriers for
biologically active materials such as hormones,
enzymes, antibiotics, antineoplastic agents, and cell
suspensions. Temporary preservation of functional
properties of a carried species, as well as controlled
release of the species into local tissues or systemic
circulation, are possible. Proper choice of hydrogel
macromers can produce membranes with a range of
permeability, pore sizes and degradation rates
suitable for a variety of applications in surgery,
medical diagnosis and treatment.Fibrin gels have been used extensively in Europe
as sealants and adhesives in surgery (Thompson et al.,
1988, "Fibrin Glue: A review of its preparation,
efficacy, and adverse effects as a topical hemostat,"
Drug Intell. and Clin. Pharm., 22:946; Gibble et al.,
1990, (1990), "Fibrin glue: the perfect operative
sealant?" Transfusion, 30(8):741). However, they
have not been used extensively in the United States 
due to concerns relating to disease transmission from
blood products. Synthetic polymers have been explored
as adhesives (Lipatova, 1986, "Medical polymer
adhesives, " Advances in Polymer Science 79 : 65-93), but
these materials have been associated with local
inflammation, cytotoxicity, and poor biocompatibility.Formation of post-surgical adhesions involving
organs of the peritoneal cavity and the peritoneal
wall is a frequent and undesirable result of abdominal
surgery. Surgical trauma to the tissue caused by
handling and drying results in release of a
serosanguinous (proteinaceous) exudate which tends to
collect in the pelvic cavity (Holtz, G., 1984). If
the exudate is not absorbed or lysed within this
period it becomes ingrown with fibroblasts, and
subsequent collagen deposition leads to adhesion
formation.Numerous approaches to elimination of adhesion
formation have been attempted, with limited success in
most cases. Approaches have included lavage of the
peritoneal cavity, administration of pharmacological
agents, and the application of barriers to
mechanically separate tissues. For example, Boyers et
al., (1988) "Reduction of postoperative pelvic
adhesions in the rabbit with Gore-Tex surgical
membrane," Fertil. Steril., 49:1066, examined Gore-Tex
surgical membranes in the prevention of adhesions.
For a review of adhesion prevention, see Holtz (1984)
"Prevention and management of peritoneal adhesions,"
Fertil. Steril., 41:497-507.
