<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic films, sheets and 
laminates and coextruded materials formed therefrom, and films 
and sheets formed from blends of an olefin polymer composition 
applied to a base film or sheet of a metallic substrate or of 
different olefin polymer materials. In many film applications, such as packaging of 
foodstuffs, chemical and hazardous materials and in medical 
applications, the industry requires films having certain 
properties. In the packaging of foodstuffs, for example, the 
films must have high puncture resistance, high clarity and 
gloss, and reduced permeability to gases and/or vapors. The 
films used to manufacture containers for chemicals and 
hazardous waste materials must have a high puncture 
resistance, high elongation strength, high tear resistance and 
chemical resistance. Films used in medical applications, such 
as blood bags, must have a high puncture resistance, low 
modulus, high tear resistance and auto-clavability. Thus, there is a need for a polymer material which has a 
lower flexural modulus, good tear strength, higher elastic 
recovery, reduced draw resonance, as well as all of the other 
desirable properties. Films made from ethylene polymers, homopolymers, e.g., 
HDPE and LLDPE, and copolymers, e.g., LLDPE, and propylene 
polymers, such as crystalline homopolymers of propylene and 
random copolymers of propylene and ethylene, do not provide 
such a combination of desirable properties.  
 Attempts have been made to overcome the shortcomings of 
these polymers by preparing heterophasic mixtures of 
crystalline propylene polymers and 8 to 25% of an elastomeric 
propylene-ethylene copolymer by sequential polymerization in 
the presence of a stereospecific Ziegler-Natta type catalyst. 
However, films of such heterophasic compositions are subject 
to the formation of fisheyes, inadequate tear strength or the 
formation of rough surfaces. EP-A 0 490 353 discloses a blend comprising: 
(a) an isotactic polypropylene matrix containing an ethylene/propylene 
copolymer dispersed phase, said combination having dual melting peaks, 
a first peak in the range of 150 °C to 165 °C, attributable 
to the matrix, and a second peak in the range of about 123 °C to 
132 °C having at least 2.2 calories per gram melting endotherm, 
attributable to the copolymer, component (a) being present in the blend 
in an amount of 60 to 90 percent by weight based on the 
weight of the blend; and (b) an ethylene/1-butene copolymer containing 85 to 90 percent by 
weight ethylene;
