<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a protein or protein complex which stimulates activated DNA transcription in eukaryotic cells, genes encoding the protein or proteins, and uses therefor. The protein or protein complex, referred to herein as a transcriptional adaptor, is associated with two other factors, each of which, in turn, binds to a region of a eukaryotic promoter. The first of these factors, referred to herein as an activator, binds to a region of the promoter DNA sequence termed the UAS binding site or enhancer. The second factor or factors, referred to herein as a general transcription factor (GTF), binds to second region of the promoter DNA sequence, termed the TATA box, which is located downstream from the UAS binding site. The transcriptional adaptor specifically binds to an acidic activation domain (i.e., one which is highly enriched in acidic amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid) on the activator protein which, in addition, includes a DNA binding domain.

 TRANSCRIPTION ADAPTORS IN EUKARYOTESDescriptionBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe activation of DNA transcription is of central importance in the regulation of genetic programs that range from control of cell growth to embryonic development in eu aryotes. Transcription begins with the synthesis of an RNA chain encoding one strand of a DNA duplex. The reaction takes place by complementary base pairing and covalent joining of ribonucleotides and is catalyzed by the enzyme RNA polymerase. Activation is not initiated by the chance encounter of the DNA and the polymerase, however, the enzyme is directed to a specific site on the DNA. In eukaryotes, two cis-acting elements on a target DNA, which together make up a promoter, have been implicated as protein binding sites essential for the initiation of transcription. It has been demonstrated that activation requires binding of specific proteins at both of these sites and only when these two sites are bound, does transcription occur. The first binding site is generally located 25-30 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site and is termed the TATA box. The second binding is at a distal location from the TATA box and is termed the upstream activation site (UAS) , or enhancer.It has been demonstrated that activation of transcription is orchestrated by two classes of protein •■factors" that are essential for the initiation of activation and which bind to the promoter at its two 

 binding sites. It is believed that RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) , which is involved in the transcription of messenger RNA, is directed to the TATA box binding site by the first class of factors, referred to as general transcriptional factors (GTF) .Further investigations have found that the second class of factors, termed activators, bind to the UAS binding site. Activators have been found to contain two domains: a DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. It has been suggested that there is a third factor involved in the DNA transcriptional machinery which mediates the interaction between GTFs and activators, termed mediators or adaptors, but the responsible protein has not been identified. There is considerable conservation in eukaryotes of factors involved in transcription, as evidenced by the fact that yeast activators work in mammalian cells and, conversely, mammalian activators function in yeast. However, the central question remains, how activators can transmit their signal to the GTFs that comprise the transcription initiation complex, even when the activator binds to
