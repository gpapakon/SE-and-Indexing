<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a filling machine for pouring a liquid filling material into bottles (2) or similar containers, there is provided on a rotor, which rotates about a vertical machine spindle, a boiler (1) and a ring (4) which surrounds the said boiler (1) and to which there are fastened a plurality of filling elements (6) which each form a filling point. The filling elements (6) are connected via a filling material connection (15) to the interior of the boiler (1). The ring (4) projects partly beyond the underside of the boiler, where through-passages (19, 22) are provided for the filling material connections. Furthermore, lifting elements (10) for container supports (7) are also guided in the ring (4).

into bottles or similar containers, with a vessel 

(1) for receiving the product to be filled and with a 
rotor or machine component rotating around a vertical 

machine axis and featuring on its circumference several 
filling points consisting each of a filling element 

(6) and an appertaining container carrier (7), with a 
ring (4) extending radially outward from the vessel 

(1) and to which the filling elements (6) are secured, 
said filling elements each having a liquid channel 

(14) with a liquid valve (16) and a discharge opening 
(14 ') at the lower portion of the filling element (6) 

through which in a filling phase, with the liquid valve 
opened, the liquid product to be filled flows to 

the respective container (2) provided at the respective 
filling point , with a product connection (15) linking 

the other end of the liquid channel (14) of each 
filling element (6) to an outlet (20) of the vessel 

(1), with at least one flowmeter (21) provided in the 
product connection (15) of at least one filling element 

(6) of a group of said filling elements, as well 
as with at least one lifting element (10) for each 

bottle carrier (7) sliding in at least one guide (12), 
wherein the ring (4) projects at least partially downward 

over a bottom (5) of the vessel (1), wherein the 
filling elements (6) are fastened to the outer surface  

 
of the ring (4) enclosing the machine axis, wherein 

the product connection (15) to the liquid channel (14) 
of each filling element (6) is led through the ring 

(4) which has a a channel or passage (22) for this purpose 
in the part projecting over the bottom (5) of the 

ring vessel (1), wherein the at least one flowmeter 
(21) is displaced radially inward below the vessel 

with respect to the inside of the ring (4) enclosing 
the machine axis in relation to said machine axis. 
Filler, as set forth in claim 1, wherein the ring 
(4) has the at least one guide (12) for the lifting 

element (10) of the respective filling element (6). 
Filler, as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
at least one flowmeter (21) is provided and fastened, 

respectively, to the inside of the ring (4). 
Filler, as set forth in any of claims 1 - 3, wherein 
the passage (22) and the part of the liquid channel 

(14) of each filling element (6) adjoining said 
passage are at a level below the lower part or the bottom 

of the vessel (5) that is spaced from the lower 
part or the bottom. 
Filler, as set forth in any of claims 1-4, wherein 
the product connection (15) in a section between the 

outlet (20) of the vessel (1) and the inside of the 
ring is designed as a pipe connection of at least one 

pipe (19) and the flowmeter (21) arranged between the 
pipe connection and the inside of the ring (4).  

 
Filler, as set forth in any of claims 1-5, wherein, 
for part of the filling elements (6), instead of the 

flowmeter (21), an intermediate piece is provided, 
which corresponds to said flowmeter in its axial dimensions 

and constitutes a passage for the liquid product 
to be filled. 
Filler, as set forth in any of claims 1-6, wherein 
the outlet (20) at the vessel (1) for each filling element 

(6) is provided in the vessel bottom. 
Filler, as set forth in any of claims 1-7, wherein 
the passage (22) for the liquid product in the ring 

(4) as well as the passage for the liquid product in 
the flowmeter or in the intermediate piece replacing 

said flowmeter are arranged on the same axis. 
Filler, as set forth in any of claims 1 - 8, wherein 
the passage (22) for the liquid product to be filled
