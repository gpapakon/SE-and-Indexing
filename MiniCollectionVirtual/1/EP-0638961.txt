<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) comprises an elongate 
insulative housing (30) having a plurality of cavities (40) extending 

in side-by-side relation along the longitudinal housing 
direction. Each of the cavities is nominally spaced for 

fine pitch applications to be on the order of 0.050 inch. 
A wire contact assembly (44) which is snapped into the connector 

housing and resiliently held therein by a releasable latch (42), 
comprises an insulation crimping portion (54) that is formed 

during the crimping process to be of oval configuration. 
The oval configuration allows the use of wires at least as 

large as 28 AWG in such fine pitch spacings and permits 
installation of each wire contact assembly (44) into the 

connector in the same orientation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical
connector and, more particularly, to a fine pitch, discrete
wire cable connector utilizing crimp technology.Packaging for telecommunications, computers and
electronic systems has continued to decrease in overall size
while increasing in functionality. This has resulted in an
increase in the density of input/output (I/O) interconnects,
creating a demand for fine pitch (0.13 cm (0.050 inch) spacings and
less) connectors to meet limited space constraints.A variety of interface standards exist today in an
effort to maintain compatibility and uniformity when
interconnecting computers to printers, drives, and other
peripheral devices. Due to the need for increased signal
speeds, controlled impedance, and electrical shielding, and
while reducing overall size and weight, a new generation of
0.13 cm (0.050 inch) pitch connectors are beginning to replace the RS-232
type D subminiature connectors which have traditionally
been used in these applications. The Small Computer Systems
Interface (SCSI) specification has been developed which
controls the electrical characteristics of the connecting
cable and outlines the mating face of the interconnects.
The contact pin layout is shown in Figure 1, which is
defined by two rows, spaced 0.254 cm (0.100 inch) apart with a contact
pitch of 0.13 cm (0.050 inch). In order to maintain this fine pitch,
certain connector designs have utilized discrete wire
insulation displacement contact (IDC) technology.IDC technology has been an efficient, cost effective
method for mass-termination of cables to connectors for many
years. The advantage stems, in part, from the ribbon cable
design. Orientation of the cable conductors in a uniform
row provides strain relief through support from adjacent
conductors, typically yielding good electrical performance. 
When using IDC technology with discrete wire cable applications, some of these
advantages are lost. Conductors must be individually terminated, thus eliminating the
inherent strain relief. Unless individual contacts have integral strain relief, excessive wire
movement can cause large changes in contact resistance or even result in open circuits
caused by a loss of the gas tight IDC termination. It thus becomes difficult in fine pitch
applications to include an integral strain relief for IDC type contacts.Crimping discrete wire conductors to contact terminals has also been a cost
effective method for high reliable interconnects for years. This technology is advantageous
in providing integral
