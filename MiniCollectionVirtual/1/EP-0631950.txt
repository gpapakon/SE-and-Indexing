<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method associated with conveyors for 
moving items where the conveyor has an endless loop belt (102) , a wear strip (600) for 

supporting the belt and means (103, 105) for moving the belt. The endless loop belt 
comprises a succession of individual components (200, 300, 700, 800), each component 

having a first end (201, 301, 802A), a second end (203, 303, 802B), an inner surface (106, 
304, 204) and an outer surface (104, 302, 202) such that the first end and the second end 

comprise a pivot. The apparatus and method of the present invention provide that the second 
end of each of the components is attached to the first end of at least one of the next 

components of the succession of components, a longitudinal band of components is formed 
having a low surface friction characteristic on the inner surface of the belt, the low 

surface-friction, longitudinal band is engaged with the wear strip for reducing the energy 
consumption and drive friction and increasing the pulling strength associated with the 

conveyor, and an effective arrangement of components is determined for optimizing the 
friction characteristics of the outer surface of the belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a conveyor apparatus having a high friction 
surface. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a high surface-friction conveyor belt having low friction connecting 
members. Conveyor belts generally, and modular conveyor belts specifically, are known. More 
particularly, it is known that an advantage to specific conveyor belts is having a high friction 
conveying surface to prevent products carried thereon from slipping, especially when 
following an inclined path. A modular conveyor belt having a high friction conveying surface 
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,925,013 issued to James M. Lapeyre on May 15, 1990. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,925,013 describes modules which make up the belt with the modules having an 
area on their top portion for attaching a frictional member. The frictional members include an 
exposed surface which exhibits increased friction characteristics and includes an appropriately 
shaped portion which is removably affixed to the module such that the frictional member is 
secured to the top of the module by suitable means such as locking receptacles, adhesives, 
rivets, screws, or the like. Similarly, a conveyor belt with a connecting drive member is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,974,724 issued to James M. Lapeyre on December 4,1990. This patent defines a belt 
made up of modules, each module having a top surface and a bottom surface and a first and 
second plurality of link ends joined by a connecting structure integrally molded with the link  
 
end. Each link end of the first and second plurality of link ends defines a pivot aperture, and 
the pluralities of pivot apertures in turn define first and second pivot axes. In the preferred 
embodiment, the elongated links extend continuously from pivot axis to pivot axis with a 
slightly orthogonal component such that the first plurality of link, or pivot, ends are offset at 
least one link end width with respect tot he second plurality of link ends. Also, the spacing 
between the thickest portions of adjacent pivot ends is somewhat greater than the width of the 
pivot end such that pivot ends of intermeshed modules can be pivotally connected. The 
modules include means for receiving a driving force which at least has a vector applied 
orthogonal to the pivot axis and substantially parallel to the common plane for purposes of 
moving the modules. A belt formed of a plurality of modules will be moved in a direction 
perpendicular to the parallel pivot axis. The means for receiving the
