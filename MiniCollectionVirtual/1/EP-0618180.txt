<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for isomerizing 
dimethylnaphthalene (DMN) in liquid phase under atmospheric 

pressure by using a catalyst comprising hydrogen-form 
mordenite which has a molar ratio of silica to alumina 

(SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio) of at least 100 and is molded by 
incorporating alumina as the molding aid therein. According 

to the above method, the objective 2,6-DMN minimized in the 
contents of impurities can stably be produced in high 

selectivity and high yield under mild reaction conditions for 
a long period of time, while side reaction and deterioration 

of the catalyst are suppressed to minimum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
2,6-dimethylnaphthalene which is useful as a starting raw 
material for 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. 2,6-naphthalene 
dicarboxylic acid is industrially important as a 
starting raw material for polyethylene naphthalate which is 
employed for producing high-performance polyester in the form 
of fiber or film having excellent tensile strength and heat 
resistance. 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene (hereinafter dimethylnaphthalene 
is sometimes abbreviated to "DMN") is employed as a starting 
raw material for 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and is 
called upon to have a high purity. DMN has 10 isomers according to the positions of two 
methyl groups. It is necessary, however, to produce 2,6-DMN 
substantially free from an isomer other than 2,6-DMN on a 
large scale at a low cost. It is well known that in the case 
of isomerizing DMN, isomerization between adjacent β-positions 
and isomerization of methyl-migration from one ring 
to another are unlikely to take place as compared with that 
between α-position and β-position. Specifically, the above-mentioned 
10 DMN isomers are classified into four groups, 
namely A to D groups as undermentioned with regard to 
isomerization, and isomerization among different groups is 
unlikely to take place as compared with that in the same  
 
group. 
Group A --- 1,5-DMN; 1,6-DMN; and 2,6-DMN Group B --- 1,8-DMN; 1,7-DMN; and 2,7-DMN Group C --- 1,4-DMN; 1,3-DMN; and 2,3-DMN Group D --- 1,2-DMN  
   As the process for producing 2,6-DMN, there are 
available a process in which naphthalene or methylnaphthalene 
is methylated, succeedingly isomerized and separated, 
isolation process from tar fraction or petroleum fraction and 
the like. However, the fraction or the reaction product 
according to any of the above-mentioned processes contains 
almost all the isomers in the aforesaid four groups, thereby 
necessitating the isomerization among different groups to 
take place for the purpose of efficiently producing 2,6-DMN 
by the isomerization of such isomers. As the method of 
isomerization among different groups, there is disclosed, for 
example in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 
88433/1984, a method in which is employed a zeolite having 
ten-membered oxygen ring at the inlet of the major cavity. 
However, the above-disclosed method gives rise to a number of 
side reactions such as disproportionation in addition to the 
isomerization because of an elevated temperature required for 
the reaction, thus lowering
