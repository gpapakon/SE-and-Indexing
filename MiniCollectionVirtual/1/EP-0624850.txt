<ABSTRACT>
A substantially universal range of color standards over the 
visible spectrum is displayed for visual observation, comparison 

with extraneous colors and for interactive color processing in a 
color computer processing system. In the comprehensive set, 

standardized colors are defined by hue supplemented by black and 
white content related in a visual format. Thus, a set of discrete 

hue values across the visible spectrum, typically 24, is displayed 
in a circular array for selections of hue. Each operator selected 

hue is displayed together with a range of related color samples 
obtained by combining black and white content to produce a range 

of colors associated with that hue. Thus a very large number of 
colors may be viewed for visual effect and comparison with 

extraneous color patterns to make selections of harmonized color 
combinations. Any of the color samples is available for interactive 

color processing, such as editing, graphical development, and 
identification of colors and particularly in harmonized sets of 

colors for processing color images. Colors in objects such as 
pai
nts, draperies, paintings, dresses, etc. thus may be closely 
identified and standardized for faithful reproduction, editing or 

other interactive color processing procedures including harmonization 
with related color schemes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to interactive color harmonizing and 
more particularly it relates to methods and electronic data 
processing systems for presenting colors systematically for 
interactive viewing and color selection. There is a need by students, artists, decorators and graphic 
designers, for example, to understand, select, match, balance 
colors and to harmonize colors in their work or study products. 
For example, if an artist has a painting that someone wants to 
order with a specific color match preference, the artist would be 
required to redo the whole painting with different colors 
harmonized to replace at least some of the original colors to 
maintain artistic integrity. For the artist to repaint using 
artistic talent alone would require a significant amount of time 
and expense to develop a coordinated painting. Similarly, if a 
decorator has a customer that wants to order a coordinated color 
scheme that coordinates with a given color matching drapery, or 
the like, significant artistic talent, time and effort may be 
required to derive a coordinated color scheme. If a person wants to exactly find, define and reproduce a 
selected color of paint or dye, there is no acceptable  
 
standardization system for selecting, viewing and coordinating 
colors over a substantially universal range of reproducibility. It is therefore an objective of this invention to provide an 
automated system for systematically finding, displaying, comparing 
and coordinating a substantially universal range of colors for 
interactive relationship with a wide range of artists, decorators 
and shoppers. Many systems of color sensing, color comparison and color 
standardization are well known in the art as exemplified by the
