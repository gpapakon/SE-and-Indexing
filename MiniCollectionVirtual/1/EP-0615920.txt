<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cardboard blank (1) or equivalent intended to form a tubular envelope surrounding two containers (pots) (2) or series of containers (2) which are juxtaposed, such as containers (2) for a dairy or sweetened composition and of a type comprising several juxtaposed panels (7, 8, 9) connected to one another by longitudinal, mutually parallel, folding lines (30), namely a central panel (7), two lateral panels (8) joined to the central panel (7) and two end panels (9) joined to the two lateral panels (8) respectively; cutout lines and folding lines being provided on at least one of the panels, said lines delimiting, in the panel, unfoldable wedging means (13) capable of being placed so as to project with respect to the panel for ensuring or contributing to the wedging of the containers (2) in the package comprising the containers (2) surrounded by the envelope. According to the invention, it includes, on the central panel (7), one or a series of wedging means (13) arranged symmetrically with respect to a longitudinal median line of symmetry (6), parallel to the folding lines (30); each wedging means (13) ensuring or contributing to the wedging of two opposite containers (2); each wedging means (13) comprises: a wedging wall (14), the two opposite longitudinal edges (15) of which, extending in a general axial direction, are shaped so as to match, in the deployed position of the wedging wall (14), two containers (2), the lateral faces of which are opposite each other; a support wall (16) joined to the central panel (7) along a first transverse folding line (17) and which has joined to it, opposite, the wedging wall (14) along a second transverse folding line (18); two wedging flaps (19) joining the longitudinal edges (15) of the support wall (16) along the folding line.

A blank (1) of card or similar material 
designed to form a tubular envelope surrounding a 

plurality of pots (2) juxtaposed in two or more rows, 
such as pots (2) for milky or sweetened compositions, the 

blank comprising a plurality of juxtaposed panels (7, 8, 
9) connected to one another along mutually parallel 

longitudinal fold lines (30), a central panel (7), two 
side panels (8) adjacent to the central panel (7), and 

two end panels (9) adjacent to the two side panels (8), 
respectively ; 


cut lines and fold lines being divided on at least 
one of the panels to define fold-out wedging means (13) 

in said panel, the wedging means (13) being suitable for 
projecting from said panel to wedge, totally or 

partially, said pots (2) in the pack comprising the pots 
(2) surrounded by the envelope and including one or a 

series of wedging means (13) on the central panel (7) and 
disposed symmetrically relative to a longitudinal midline 

of symmetry (6) parallel to the fold lines (30), each 
wedging means being completely formed by cutting and 

folding the central panel without any additional 
material, and adapted to wedge two facing pots , and 
 
   characterised in that each wedging means (13) 

comprises : 

a wedging wall (14) having two opposite 
longitudinal edges (15) extending in a generally axial 

direction and shaped so that, in a deployed position of 
the wedging wall (14), said longitudinal edges fit snugly 

against side faces of two facing pots (2) ; 
a support wall (16) joined to the central panel 
(7) along a first transverse fold line (17) and joined at 

its opposite end to the wedging wall (14) along a second 
transverse fold line (18), said support wall (16) being  

 
at an angle lying in the range of 15 to 50 degrees 

relative to said central panel (7) ; 
two wedging flaps (19) joined to the longitudinal 
edges (15) of the support wall (16) along the fold line 

(22). 
A blank (1) according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the shaped longitudinal edges (15) of the wedging 

wall (14) are curved with a convex side of the curve 
facing towards the center of said wedging wall (14). 
A blank (1) according to any of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the support wall (16) is generally 

in the form of an isosceles trapezium whose large base is 
the fold line (17) joining it to the central panel (7), 

and whose small base is the fold line (18) joining it to 
the wedging wall (14). 
A blank (1) according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the fold lines (22) of the wedging 

flaps (19) are rectilinear. 
A blank (1) according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that each wedging flap (19) is 

substantially in the form of a right-angled triangle. 
A blank (1) according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the fold line (17) joining the 

support wall (16) to the central panel (7) is situated 
close to a transverse edge (23) of said central panel 

(7). 
A pack comprising a plurality of pots (2) 
juxtaposed in two or more rows, such as pots (2) for 

milky or sweetened compositions, and a tubular envelope 
which surrounds said pots (2) and holds them together, 

said envelope having a bottom portion (10) on which the 
pots stand, two side portions (11) placed against side 

faces of the pots (2) and a top portion (12) overlying 
top faces (4) of the pots (2), wedging means (13)  

 
adjoining the bottom portion (10) to wedge, totally or 

partially, the pots (2) near bottom portions (3) thereof, 
the pack including on its bottom portion (10) one or a 

series of said wedging means (13) disposed symmetrically 
relative to a longitudinal midline of symmetry (6) 

parallel to fold lines (30) ; characterised in that each 
wedging means (13) comprises a deployed wedging wall (14) 

placed above and substantially parallel to the central 
panel (7), having opposite longitudinal edges (15) that 

extend in a generally axial direction, said longitudinal 
edges (15) being shaped to fit snugly against the side 

faces of two facing pots (2) ; said wedging wall (14) 
being carried at one end by an inclined support wall (16) 

connected to the central panel (7) ; and two wedging 

flaps (19) adjoining the support wall (16) projecting 
therefrom and being directed away from the central panel 

(7) to bear against the side faces of the pots (2). 
A pack according to claim 7, characterised in 
that, relative to the central panel (7), the support wall 

(16) is at an angle lying in the range of 15 to 50 
degrees. 
A pack according to any of claims 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the pots are arranged in a single 

layer. 
A pack according to any of claims 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the pots (2) are arranged in two 

superposed layers (31, 32), with the top pots being 
wedged by top wedging means (33) shaped on said top 

portion (12) of the envelope, the top wedging means (33) 
being identical with the wedging means (33) provided on 

said bottom portion (10) of the envelope formed by a 
flank (34) surrounding said tubular envelope and the 

second layer (31) of pots (2).
