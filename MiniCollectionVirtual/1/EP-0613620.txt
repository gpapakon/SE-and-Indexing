<ABSTRACT>
A dairy spread comprising dairy and edible non-dairy fat is 
prepared by a process including the steps of (a) 

concentrating dairy cream to 55-85% fat, (b) blending the 
concentrated cream with non-dairy fat at 50-70°C, (c) 

cooling the blend to 15-30°C and optionally storing at that 
temperature for 4-48 hours to allow partial crystallisation 

of the dairy and non-dairy fats and (d) inducing phase 
inversion of the resultant mixture. At least some of the 

non-dairy fat is preferably hard or hardened. The 
non-dairy fat may be an animal fat, including fish oil, or 

vegetable oil and is preferably a vegetable oil. The 
product has a smooth, non-grainy texture in which dairy 

flavour is predominant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of a dairy spread and in particular to a process 
for producing a butter-like spread containing a proportion 
of non-dairy fat, especially vegetable fat, and having good 
organoleptic characteristics. A major problem faced by the dairy industry in the 
production of butter and dairy spreads is that a 
significant proportion of the total fat is lost into the 
buttermilk at the churning or phase inversion stage of 
manufacture. In butter making, as much as 0.6% of the 
total fat is lost into the buttermilk and in certain mixed 
products the fat loss can be as high as 1.2%. Such high 
levels of fat loss represent a heavy financial burden to 
the producers of butters and dairy spreads. A process and plant for producing a milk-based fat product 
in which the fat loss is reduced to 0.15% are disclosed in 
WO89/10700. In that process, cream is concentrated to 
between 60% and 85% fat at between 50°C and 70°C. After 
cooling to between 15°C and 30°C, the concentrated cream is 
left to crystallise partially. Unhardened vegetable oil is 
then added and the mixture is gently worked at a 
temperature of between 8°C and 14°C until phase inversion 
is completed. Products made by this process can 
conveniently incorporate up to 40% of the fat as vegetable 
derived oil. These products were designed for the 
Scandinavian market, where predominating lactic flavours in 
products of this type are customary and are achieved by the 
addition of a souring culture distillate, and where the 
vegetable oil component of mixed products is unhardened. It has been found that the process described in WO89/10700  
 
is unsuitable for the manufacture of the sweet cream dairy 
spread products which are popular in markets in other parts 
of Europe and elsewhere. Products made by the process of 
WO 89/10700 and to which no lactic flavours have been added 
have been found to be less organoleptically acceptable 
outside the Scandanavian market, as the taste of the 
vegetable oil component has been found to be dominant in 
some of the products produced. A further difficulty arises 
where at least a portion of the vegetable fat is hardened. 
In that case, the resulting products have been found to 
have a grainy consistency, which is disliked by consumers 
and which is in contrast to the smoothness of similar 
dairy-spreads produced by other known processes. This 
grainy consistency is a consequence of the difficulty of 
obtaining good mixing of the vegetable fat component into 
the

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a dairy spread comprising 
concentrating dairy cream to a fat content of 55-85%, 

blending the concentrated cream with edible non-dairy fat 
at 50-70°C to produce a homogeneous dispersion of oil 

droplets and emulsification of these oil droplets in the 
cream, cooling the blend to between 15-30°C and working the 

blend to obtain phase inversion. 
A process according to Claim 1, including the step of 
partially crystallising the blend at 15-30°C for 4-48 hours 

prior to phase inversion. 
A process according to Claim 2, in which the partial 
crystallisation step is conducted at 18-24°C for 4-18 

hours. 
A process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, in which 
at least a portion of the non-dairy fat has a slip melting 

point above 15-30°C and that portion crystallises 
simultaneously with the cream durin
g the partial 
crystallisation step and/or the phase inversion step. 
A process according to any preceding claim, in which 
the non-dairy fat comprises a blend of liquid and hard or 

hardened fat or fats, including blends of non-dairy fat 
species from different sources. 
A process according to any preceding claim, in which 
the dairy spread comprises 40-80% fat, of which up to 85% 

is non-dairy fat. 
A process according to any preceding claim, in which 
the blending step is conducted at 55-65°C, preferably at 

 
about 60°C. 
A process according to any preceding claim in which the 
non-dairy fat is selected from non-dairy animal, fish or 

vegetable fat or combinations thereof. 
A process according to Claim 8, in which the non-dairy 
fat is a vegetable fat selected from soya bean oil, 

sunflower oil, safflower oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, 
coconut oil, corn oil or combinations thereof.
