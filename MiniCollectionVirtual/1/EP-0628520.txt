<ABSTRACT>
A machine for making glass containers having a 
number of displaceable mechanisms 11N comprising a 

plurality of selectively operable regulators 37N for 
controlling the operation of the displaceable 

mechanisms, a control panel 32 including a 
corresponding plurality of toggle switches 34 

switchable between select and deselect positions, 
each toggle switch being associated with one of the 

regulators. The control panel is enabled when all of 
the toggle switches are in the down position and 

start motion buttons 48, 49 pushed simultaneously 
will implement the machine state defined by the 

operator by locating specific toggle switches in the 
select position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to machines which form
glass containers from gobs of molten glass. One such
machine is an Individual Section (I.S.) machine which has a
number of identical sections, each of which can be viewed as
a discrete machine since each receives gobs of molten glass
and forms them into containers.Each section or machine has a number of mechanisms
which are displaced by non profiled motion actuators such as
pneumatic cylinders. Process air like settle air or cooling
air may also be required. In state of the art machines
these mechanisms, etc. are controlled by regulators such as
solenoid operated valves (single acting, spring return or
double acting).The machine is intended to operated under automatic
control but during set-up and repair, the operator must be
able to operate the machine under manual control.When operating under manual control there is a danger
of injury to an operator resulting from movement of parts
and mechanisms as it is possible in certain circumstances
for an operator's hands to be adjacent such parts and
mechanisms as they move.It is accordingly an object of the present invention to
provide a manually controlled system for operating the I.S.
machine that minimises these risks.The invention generally comprises a machine for making
glass containers comprising
a plurality of mechanisms displaceable between known
positions, means including a corresponding plurality of
selectively operable regulators for displacing said
mechanisms between said known positions, first and second depressible start buttons,
characterised by  a corresponding plurality of toggle switches switchable
between regulator on and regulator off positions, each
toggle switch corresponding to one of said regulators,means for enabling said first and second depressible
start buttons, andmeans for operating each regulator that has its
corresponding toggle switch position on, when said first and
second enabled start buttons are depressed simultaneously.Other objects and advantages of the present invention
will become apparent from the following portion of this
specification and from the accompanying drawings which
illustrate a presently preferred embodiment incorporating
the principles of the invention.Referring to the drawings:
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the valve block
assembly made in accordance with the teachings of the
present invention connected to an individual section of an
I.S. machine;Figure 2 is a view of a portion of the valve block
assembly shown in Figure 1 with the cover
