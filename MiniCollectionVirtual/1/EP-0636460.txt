<ABSTRACT>
The tool for anchoring expansion plugs (straddling dowels) consists of a handle (1) and two receiving devices (2, 10) into each of which can be inserted a setting mandrel (8, 13), the longitudinal axes of the receiving openings of the receiving devices (2, 10) being at an angle of 90 DEG  to one another. With the aid of resilient elements, a prestress is exerted on the clamped-in setting mandrels (8, 13) when the receiving devices (2, 10) are in the relaxed state.

<CLAIMS>
A tool for anchoring expansion anchors by means of a placement drift (8, 13), having 
a handle (1), 
characterised in that
 the handle (1) has two receiver devices (2, 10) 
for the placement drift (8, 13) and the longitudinal axes of the receiver openings of 

the receiver devices (2, 10) are at an angle to each other. 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal axes of the receiver 
openings are at an angle of 90Â° to each other. 
A tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the free cross-section of the 
receiver openings is variable. 
A tool according to claim 3, characterised in that at least one of the receiver devices 
(2, 10) is constructed in the manner of a collet chuck (12). 
A tool according to claim 4, characterised in that the collet chuck (12) comprises 
elements acting towards the centre of the receiver opening under spring pressure.
