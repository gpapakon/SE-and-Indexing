<ABSTRACT>
There is described an electronic interrogation and identification (I/I) system (10) in which an interrogator/reader (I/R) unit (12) operates remotely using a microwave beam (16, 70) in conjunction with one or more coded articles (30). The articles are identified by a unique method and search sequence. As the I/R unit (12) interrogates the articles (30), one or more of them respond to the I/R unit whenever a code word (data value) sent from the I/R unit matches a code word stored in one or more of the memory (54) position within the articles. After searching through all of the possible code words and word positions the I/R unit will have identified at least one code word stored in each of the word positions of at least one article. Then combinations of the just-identified code words are matched with the respective stored words of the various articles (30). After being uniquely identified each article (30) is "powered-down" on command from the I/R unit (12) and remains inactive so that one-by-one all remaining articles (30) are also identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a highly economical and efficient
apparatus and method for remotely interrogating and identifying
simultaneously a number of electronically coded articles with great
rapidity (within a small fraction of a second), and with extreme
accuracy and security (correct identification of any of over 60 billion
coded numbers).Bank credit cards, employee identification (ID) badges, coded tags
and the like frequently have a magnetic strip on a face of thereof. Coded
information such as an account status, employee ID number, entry
authorization, etc., is recorded on the strip for subsequent retrieval and
use. To read the information on the card, it must be physically placed in
a suitable card reader apparatus. Only one card at a time can be read by
a given card reader and it is necessary to bring each card directly to the
card reader. While this way of identification of a card has the advantage
of very low cost coding of the card, it has the important disadvantage of
requiring the physical insertion of the card into a card reader, and the
need for queuing of the cards to be read in turn, one at a time.Various systems for the remote identification of moving objects
such as railroad cars, have been developed in the past. One of the
simplest systems uses an optical bar code applied to the side of each car.
As the car moves past a given location an electronic monitor projects a
laser beam from some distance away and scans the bar code. The
monitor picks up reflected light from the laser beam as the bar code is
scanned and produces electronic signals corresponding to the code for
that particular car. While such a system can read a coded object (via the 
bar code) on-the-fly from some feet away, the system becomes inaccurate
or inoperable when fog, dirt, and the like obscure the reflected laser
light. Even when working as intended, the system relies on the laser
light beam impinging on and being properly reflected back from the
optical bar code within certain narrow angles.Use of radio frequency as the data communication link in remote
interrogation/identification (I/I) systems is also well known. An article
entitled "Microwave Tag Identification Systems" by Daniel D.
Mawhinney, pp. 589 to 610, RCA Review, Vol.44, December 1983,
discusses in detail various kinds of such systems using microwave
frequencies. As this article points out, coded objects (such as badges,
tags, etc.) to be identified can be categorized as "passive", "driven", and
"active". An example of a "passive" tag is one having an
