<ABSTRACT>
Display apparatus comprises a display screen (400) and a drive 
circuit (401) connected to the display screen (400) to generate an image 

on the display screen (400) in response to an input video signal (R,G,B). 
A timer (405) generates a count in response to a clock signal. A detector 

(403,404,402) also receives the input video signal and resets the timer 
(405) on detection of a change in image content between successive frames 

of the input video signal (R,G,B). Control means (402) is connected to 
the timer (405) and to the drive circuit (401) for at least partially 

disabling the drive circuit (401) in response to the count stored in the 
timer (405) exceeding a predetermined threshold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to display apparatus with means for 
detecting quiescence in input video to provide power management. Conventional computer systems generally include a computer system 
unit, a visual display unit for displaying computer data generated in the 
computer system unit, and a keyboard for entering data to the computer 
system unit. In some conventional computer systems, power management in 
the display is provided by detection of keyboard activity in the system 
unit. If the operator leaves such a computer system unattended for a 
period of time, the system unit instructs the display to reduce the 
brightness and/or the size of the image displayed. The system unit 
instructs the display to restore the brightness and/or size of the image 
displayed on detection of the next keyboard entry made by the operator. 
In other conventional computer systems, such power management cannot be 
provided in the display because the system unit has no way of 
communicating instructions to the display. GB 2 007 471 A describes display apparatus including: a display 
screen; a drive circuit for receiving an input video signal, the drive 
circuit being connected to the display screen in response to the input 
video signal; a timer for generating a count in response to a clock 
signal; a detector for receiving the input video signal and for resetting 
the timer on detection of a change in image content between successive 
frames of the input video signal; and control means connected to the 
timer and to the drive circuit for at least partially disabling the drive 
circuit in response to the count stored in the timer exceeding a 
predetermined threshold. In accordance with the present invention, there is now provided 
display apparatus including: a display screen; a drive circuit for 
receiving an input video signal, the drive circuit being connected to the 
display screen in response to the input video signal; a timer for 
generating a count in response to a clock signal; a detector, for 
receiving the input video signal and for resetting the timer on detection 
of a change in image content between successive frames of the input video 
signal and control means connected to the timer and to the drive circuit 
for at least partially disabling the drive circuit in response to the 
count stored in the timer exceeding a predetermined threshold;  
 
charaterised in that the detector includes: thresholding means for 
generating a pulse signal in response to transitions the input video 
signal across a
