<ABSTRACT>
The handle (11) which guides the cleaner is attached to the front end of same and is mounted to swivel about an axis running parallel to the axis of the wheels or rollers. The handle is angled or bent so that when resting on the ground (5) its free end points inclined or perpendicularly upwards. The upwardly directed section (19) of the handle has likewise upwardly directed sockets (21,25) for accessories (23). The sockets can be insert sleeves for spray pipes or slide guides for a washing brush. An insert sleeve can be provided on each side of the handle. The slide guide is then mounted between the two insert sleeves.
