<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for identifying the source of a transported chemical shipment. The method employs either a chemical element or an organic compound with one or more atoms that are non-radioactive isotopes generally not found in nature. A small quantity of the isotopic compound is introduced into the storage vessel containing the chemical to be transported prior to shipment of the chemical. Upon arrival at its destination point, a sample of the chemical shipment is analyzed. Matching the isotopic compound found in the chemical with the isotopic compound introduced into the storage vessel prior to shipment is indicative that the shipped chemical is identical to the chemical received. Non-radioactive materials may further be employed for detecting the source of a newly introduced contaminant in a water supply. The chemical substance may be a non-radioactive isotope of the chemical shipment being transported.

<DESCRIPTION>
Contamination of water with potentially hazardous materials is a common
problem facing industry, the government and the general public. As a result of
spills in waterways, leakage from storage facilities and surface discharges,
contaminants are slowly destroying our water supply. Such contaminants may
further enter our water supplies via subsurface soil and/or rock formations and
eventually percolate into the groundwater. There are over two hundred organic
and inorganic chemicals which have been identified in various groundwater
supplies alone. Such ground water is the principal source of municipal water.
agricultural irrigation. and water used by industry. There is thus a consistent
health threat to our drinking water supplies. In addition, chemical discharging
into intercoastal waters has resulted in damage to marine life as well as to marine
ecosystems.It is a fairly common occurrence to find such contaminants in our
lakes and rivers as well as the surrounding oceans. The amount of unlawful
dumping of such wastes is increasing in the waters of the United States.
Groundwater, drinking water and waste water continues to be jeopardized as such
activities continue. Useful methods of ascertaining the source of such pollutants
into our waterways is essential.Clearly there is a longfelt need by the public for a safe technique for
"serializing" or "fingerprinting" petroleum, petroleum products and bulk chemicals
in storage or transit so that responsibility for dumping, spilling or leakage of such
chemicals can be appropriately determined. There is also a need for serializing
bulk adulterants such as cyanides which are sometimes placed in foods and
medicines by disturbed people to aid in apprehending such people. There is also
a longfelt need by the petroleum and chemical industry for safe techniques to 
serialize oil and other chemical products for internally auditing the transfer of
such products to prevent and/or prove theft.It has been proposed to use radioactive materials as tracers in fluids.
However, the use of radioactive materials for fingerprinting liquids would not be
totally satisfactory. The consumption of petroleum products containing
radioactive tracers, for example, would result in their uncontrolled release into the
environment. It has also been proposed to use certain non-radioactive tracers in
reservoir characterization studies to determine fluid residence times and
conductive fluid flow paths. However, in such applications, the tracer is detected
in salt water. Salt water is a very simple

<CLAIMS>
A method of tagging a fluid
to render it distinguishable

from other fluids, comprising
introducing into said fluid

at least two taggants
each of which will disperse

in said fluid, each taggant
being a different deuterated

version of the same hydrogen-containing
organic chemical compound and wherein, in each

deuterated version, in a significantly
larger proportion of the molecules

thereof than is to be expected
from the natural abundance of

deuterium, at least one hydrogen
site in the moleude is occupied

by deuterium, and wherein, 
in each said taggant, the same hydrogen site or

combination of hydrogen
sites is occupied by deuterium

as in the other molecules of
that taggant and a different

hydrogen site or combination
of hydrogen sites is

occupied by deuterium
than in the other taggants. 
A method according to
claim 1 wherein a said

taggant comprises
deuterated octane, or

deuterated n-octene or
deuterated acetone.
