<ABSTRACT>
A ballast or track formation working machine (1) for a track (8) formed from rails (6) and sleepers (7) has a machine frame (2) capable of travelling continuously on the track by means of rail running mechanisms (5), and a track-lifting device (15) arranged between two rail running mechanisms and connected height-adjustably to the machine frame (2) by means of drives (37) for lifting the track (8). The track-lifting device (15) is equipped with a supporting body (25) which runs perpendicularly to the machine longitudinal direction, is constructed longer than the length of a sleeper, forms, when in use, with the drives (37) a constructional unit (38) embracing the track (8) in the machine transverse direction and supported solely on the machine frame (2), and is connected to a rolling element (26) - rotatable about an axis oriented in the machine transverse direction - for supporting the sleepers (7) of the track (8).

A machine for the treatment of a ballast bed or of 
a formation for a track composed of rails and sleepers, 

comprising a machine frame (2) designed for continuous 
mobility on the track (8) by means of on-track undercarriages 

(5) and a track lifting device (15;46) arranged between two 
on-track undercarriages (5) and connected to the machine 

frame (2) for vertical adjustment by means of drives (37;51) 
for the purpose of lifting the track (8), the track lifting 

device (15;46) having a roller element (26;50;58) - rotatable 
about an axis (40;60) oriented in the transverse direction of 

the machine - for supporting the sleepers (7) of the track 
(8), characterized in that the track lifting device (15;46) 

has a support body (25;47) which extends perpendicularly to 
the longitudinal direction of the machine and is designed 

to be longer than the length of a sleeper, and which in 
operation forms with the drives (37;51) a structural unit 

(38) surrounding the track (8) in the transverse direction 
of the machine and supported solely on the machine frame (2), 

the support body (25) being connected in the region of its 
two mutually opposite ends, with respect to the transverse 

direction of the machine, to struts (42) which are connected 
to the machine frame (2) for pivoting about a universal joint 

(44) in a common articulation point (43) distanced from the 
drives (37) in the longitudinal direction of the machine, and 

that a pivot drive (45) linked to the machine frame (2) is 
associated with the struts (42). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
drives (37;51) and the struts (42) are detachably connected 

to the support body (25;47). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the roller element (26) is designed  

 
as a caterpillar chain (39) designed to roll along in the 

longitudinal direction of the machine. 
A machine according to claim 3, characterized in that 
two caterpillar chains (39) are provided, distanced from one 

another in the transverse direction of the machine and each 
having two deflection rollers (41) which are spaced apart 

from one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine 
at a distance corresponding approximately to twice the 

sleeper spacing. 
A machine according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the diameter of the deflection rollers (41) is designed to 

correspond to about half a sleeper spacing. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the drives (37) and the struts (42) 

are respectively linked to a point on the support body (25) 
situated centrally between the deflection rollers (41) 

which are spaced apart from one another in the longitudinal 
direction of th
e machine. 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
roller element (58) is provided with a number of rollers (59) 

arranged one behind the other in the longitudinal direction 
of the machine and having horizontal axes (60) extending in 

the transverse direction of the machine, the distance apart 
of these rollers being designed to be smaller than the width 

of a sleeper. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the track lifting device (15) with the 

support body (25) is arranged between two other track lifting 
devices (14,16) which are arranged at a distance from one 

another in the longitudinal direction of the machine and 
are respectively provided with roller lifting clamps (17) 

designed to ride on the rail head.  
 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the support body (47;62) is connected 

to guide rollers (55;64) spaced apart in the transverse 
direction of the machine, arranged during operation in the 

immediate end region of the sleepers (7) and rotatable about 
a vertical axis (56).
