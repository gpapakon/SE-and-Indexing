<ABSTRACT>
An application method for luster pigments based on inorganic platelet-like particles with at least one metal oxide surface coating comprises initially applying the pigments to a vitreous surface such as a vitreous enamel on a metal substrate, a vitreous glaze on a ceramic substrate, glass, or an overglaze on a glass, enameled metal or glazed ceramic substrate. The vitreous surface is in a fused or unfused state prior to the luster pigment application. The luster pigment is surface applied to the vitreous surface. Next, the surface is heated to a temperature and for a time sufficient to fix the luster pigments to the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of applying
inorganic based luster pigments to a surface. More
particularly, the invention relates to a method of
applying the luster pigments to a vitreous surface in a
manner wherein the luster pigment is fixed thereto
without causing an adverse appearance effect.US-A-4418099 describes the use of non-metallic luster
pigments in coating compositions for glass and ceramics which
result in a satin precious metal finish.Luster pigments have a unique appearance. They have
a pearlesdent appearance which is pleasing to the eye.
Those luster pigments which have been widely
commercialized are mica flakes coated with a metal
oxide such as titanium dioxide and/or ferric oxide.
They are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,087,828 and
3,087,829. The pigments are recommended for use in
many formulations and have found wide acceptance in
automotive paints, printing inks, plastic bottles,
cosmetics and simulated pearls. Other luster pigments
which are commercially available, though have not been
as widely used, have an inorganic platelet-shaped
particle such as glass with the metal oxide coating.
They are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,331,699.
Organic luster pigments, as described in U.S. Patent 
No. 5,026,429, are also available.Use of the luster pigments in vitreous compositions,
however, has been limited. Vitreous compositions, per
se, are well known. They are based on ground glass,
glass forming materials or a mixture of both. Such
compositions can be coatings which are applied to a
substrate and then heated or fired to a temperature
sufficient to cause the coating components to melt.
When cooled, a thin coating of glass is formed on the
substrate. The coatings are commonly referred to as
vitreous enamels when the substrate is a metal and
vitreous glazes when the substrate is a ceramic. The
coatings are used to decorate the substrate with color
or artistic renditions as well as add to the
substrate's durability in terms of scratch and mar
resistance, moisture barrier, etc.The customary and normal procedure for incorporating
pigments in vitreous compositions is to include them in
the body of the composition's glass component.
Alternatively, the pigments are incorporated in a
vitreous flux which is applied to a vitreous substrate.
In either case, the vitreous composition must be heated
to a high temperature to fuse the glass components. It
follows that any pigment included in the formulation
must be able to withstand the high temperatures. This
has not been a problem with many of the

A method of applying luster pigment to a vitreous surface
of an article in a manner wherein the pigment is fixed thereto,

comprising applying a surface coating of luster pigment
comprising inorganic platelet-shaped particles having a surface

coating of at least one metal oxide layer to a vitreous surface,
and heating the vitreous surface to a sufficient temperature and

for a sufficient time to fix the luster pigment thereto,
characterised in that the luster pigment is fixed directly to the

vitreous surface without the benefit of flux, frit or other
binding material, thereby providing a durable lustrous coating.
A method of claim 1 wherein the vitreous surface is a
vitreous enamel overlying a metal substrate, a vitreous glaze

overlying a ceramic substrate, a glass substrate, or a glass
substrate having a vitreous enamel thereon.
