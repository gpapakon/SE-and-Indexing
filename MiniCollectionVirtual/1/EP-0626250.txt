<ABSTRACT>
- The subject of the invention is a method for manufacturing a connecting rod from monolithic composite material by placing pre-impregnated fibres on an extractable mandrel, characterised in that it comprises the following successive steps: producing a meltable mandrel (7), of shape corresponding to that of the connecting rod, on a central rigid shaft (6); winding and/or laying down in contact with each other the said pre-impregnated fibres, according to a predetermined number of layers and a predetermined inclination of the fibres with respect to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel (7); polymerising, with application of a homogeneous compacting pressure over the entire external surface of the assembly thus obtained; and then the final operations of removing the said mandrel (7) and of machining the connecting rod to the required dimensions. - Application to the manufacture of connecting rods, especially made from monolithic composite material.

Method of manufacturing a single-piece connecting rod made
of composite material, comprising a cylindrical hollow main

part (1) connected at each end to a fork joint (2) by a
connecting part (3) with a changing thickness, consisting of:


producing, on a rigid central shaft (6), an extractable
spindle, notably a fusible spindle (7), having a cylindrical

central part (8) extended at each end by a connecting part (9)
corresponding to said connecting parts (3) of the connecting

rod and itself extended by a piece (10) with a rectangular
cross section corresponding to said fork joints (2) on the

connecting rod;
winding and/or depositing in contact on said spindle (7) and
said pieces (10) with a rectangular cross section, pre-impregnated

fibres, in accordance with a predetermined number
of layers and a predetermined inclination of the fibres with

respect to the axis of the spindle;
polymerising with the application of an even compacting
pressure over the entire external surface of the assembly thus

obtained;
then removing said spindle (7) and pieces (10) and drilling
and machining said fork joints (2) to the required dimensions.
Method of manufacturing a single-piece connecting rod made
of composite material, comprising a cylindrical hollow main

part (1) connected by a connecting part (3) with a changing
thickness, on the one hand to a fork joint (2) and on the other

hand to a flattened head (39), consisting of: 

producing, on a rigid central shaft (29), an extractable
spindle, notably a fusible spindle (28), having a cylindrical

central part (32) extended at each end by a connecting part (9,
31) corresponding to said changing parts (3) of the connecting

rod, one (9) of said connecting parts being extended by a piece
(10) with a rectangular cross section corresponding to the fork

joint (2) on the connecting rod, whilst the other one (31) of
the said connecting parts is extended by a piece (33) with a

rectangular cross section corresponding to said flattened head
(39) on the connecting rod;
winding and/or depositing in contact on said spindle (28) and
said pieces (10, 33) with a rectangular cross section, pre-impregnated

fibres, in accordance with a predetermined number
of layers and a predetermined inclination of the fibres with

respect to the axis of the spindle;
removing said piece (33) corresponding to said flattened head
(39) of the connecting rod and pressing against each other, by

means of shaping means (38) appropriate to the shape of said
flattened head (39), the opposing flanks of the part of the

composite material facing said removed piece (33), in order to
form said flattened head (39);
polymerising with application of an even compacting pressure
over the entire external surface of the assembly thus obtained;
then removing said spindle (28) and piece (10) corresponding
to said fork joint (2) on the connecting rod and drilling and

machining said fork joint (2) and flattened head (39) to the
required dimensions.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that,
after winding/deposition of fibres and before

polymerisation/compacting of the composite material, the or

with shaping means (21a, 21b) appropriate to the shape of said
fork joint (2) on the connecting rod.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the assembly consisting of the rigid central shaft (6),

the spindle provided with the fibres, as well as, where
applicable, shaping means (21a, 21b, 38) according to Claim 3,

is disposed inside a bladder which is then put under vacuum,
and then said assembly with its bladder (27) is placed in an

autoclave under pressure in order to ensure said
