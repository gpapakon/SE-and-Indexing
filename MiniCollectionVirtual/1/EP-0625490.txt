<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
forming a carbonated hydroxyapatite composition and, 
in particular, to a method for forming translucent 
carbonated hydroxyapatite compositions which are 
substantially fully dense. Hydroxyapatite is a member of the apatite group 
of minerals and has the chemical formula 
Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂. It is, essentially, a 
calcium phosphate including hydroxide having a Ca/P 
ratio of 1.67. Synthetic hydroxyapatite Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂ 
has been reported as having been used as a bone 
replacement material in porous, granular, plasma 
sprayed and dense forms. Investigations have shown 
hydroxyapatite to be similar structurally to bone 
material. However hydroxyapatite is one of the range 
of stoichiometric calcium phosphate apatites. Human 
and animal bone mineral have been shown to contain 
significant amounts of carbonate. There is evidence 
that the carbonate group can substitute in two sites, 
the phosphate and hydroxyl sites, termed B and A 
respectively; bone mineral being predominantly a B 
type apatite. Despite being closer to bone mineral 
structurally, there has been no previous major 
application in the biomedical field of carbonated 
apatites. Synthetic B type apatite is produced by a 
precipitation method by the mixing of calcium, 
phosphate and carbonate ions in a highly basic 
environment. This method can result in a range of 
apatite crystal morphologies and sizes, depending 
upon the concentration of the various ions and 
solution temperature.  
 There are two main stages in processing the 
precipitated apatite into a dense ceramic, namely the 
production of a green body and sintering. Green or 
unfired compacts are produced by two main methods, 
slip casting and the pressing of a powder in a mould, 
which normally results in a body with from 40 to 60% 
porosity. Sintering is the densification of the 
green compact on heating, normally at temperatures > 
0.5 Tm, as a result of diffusion processes, with the 
driving force being the reduction in surface area. 
Apatites are thought to densify by bulk and grain 
boundary diffusion mechanisms. Grain growth is a 
process that occurs simultaneously and after 
densification. Usually in order to optimize 
properties, such as hardness and fracture toughness, 
it is desirable to maximise the density and minimize 
the grain size. However, as grain growth often 
occurs during densification, intergranular porosity 
can be formed as the grain boundaries migrate past 
regions of porosity. Grain growth is often more 
energeti
