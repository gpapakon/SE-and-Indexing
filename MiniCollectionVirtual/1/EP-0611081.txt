<ABSTRACT>
Fine particle size cement compositions useful for 
cementing in a subterranean zone penetrated by a well bore, 

comprise a fine particle size hydraulic cement, from 20% to 
90% (by weight of the cement) of a fine particle size 

pozzolanic material, and sufficient water to form a pumpable 
slurry. The particle size of the cement and of the 

pozzolanic material is not more than 30 microns. The Blaine 
Fineness of the cement is no less than 6000 cm²/g and of the 

pozzolanic material is no less than 5000 cm²/g.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cement 
compositions useful for the construction and repair of 
wells, and more particularly to such cement compositions 
which are of fine particle size. In cementing operations such as those carried out 
in constructing and repairing oil, gas and water wells, a 
hydraulic cement composition is prepared by mixing a 
hydraulic cement with water and other additives, the 
composition is placed into a subterranean zone to be 
cemented and allowed to set into a hard substantially 
impermeable mass therein. After a well has been constructed and used in the 
recovery of fluids from or the introduction of fluids into 
subterranean formations, problems relating to the unwanted 
passage of fluids into or from subterranean formations or 
the well bore penetrating such formations sometimes occur. 
This unwanted passage of fluids can severely disrupt or 
terminate the operation of a well. The unwanted passage of fluids referred to above 
ordinarily involves the flow of oil, gas or water through 
small openings such as holes or cracks in well casing; 
holes, cracks, voids or channels in the cement sheath in the 
annular space between the walls of the well bore and the 
well casing; very small spaces between the cement sheath 
and the exterior  
 
surface of the casing or the walls of the well bore; and 
permeable spaces in gravel packs and formations. Heretofore, such openings have been plugged or attempted 
to be plugged using hydraulic cement compositions. However, 
when the openings are very small, it is difficult to cause a 
cement composition of relatively large particle size to enter 
the openings and set therein whereby the openings are plugged. 
If the cement composition utilized can not enter the openings, 
at best a bridge or patch may be formed over the openings to 
produce only a temporary termination of the unwanted fluid 
flow. In primary cementing, i.e., the forming of the above 
mentioned cement sheath in the annular space between pipe 
disposed in a well bore and the walls of the well bore, a 
pumpable hydraulic cement composition is introduced into the 
annular space and the cement composition is permitted to set 
therein. The cement sheath provides physical support and 
positioning to the pipe in the well bore and prevents unwanted 
fluid migration between subterranean zones and formations 
penetrated by the well bore. If the hardened cement sheath 
between the pipe and walls of the well bore contains spaces 
such as voids, cracks or channels, the
