<ABSTRACT>
System in which subscribers (2) are able to transmit, via the 
telephone network (1) and a processing system (7), selection codes to a TV or 

radio station (5) in response to a selection question presented in a TV or radio 
programme using a code transmitter (6). The processing system is connected 

to different TV or radio stations which each transmit programmes in which 
one or more selection questions are presented. Each of said selection questions 

is coded by the processing system to form a selection code which is part of a 
single, simple series of selection codes. Regardless of the TV station or the 

programme, the questions can be answered by means of selection codes taken 
from the same series in all cases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for transmitting and processing 
selection codes activated by TV or radio subscribers to form selection code 
signals as a response to selection questions presented in TV or radio 
programmes, such selection codes being selected by the TV or radio 
subscribers, activated and emitted by means of a code transmitter, provided 
with a selection device, and being transmitted via a transmission network, 
such as a public telephone network, to a processing system connected to said 
transmission network. Such a system is disclosed as a "televoting system" in an earlier 
application by the Applicant which is specified under D. The latter assumes 
the situation in which TV or radio subscribers are always able to make their 
choice (selection) known to only one TV or radio station via their code sender. 
In said known system, the processing device is connected to only one TV or 
radio transmitting system. No solution is provided for the case where there 
may be different stations which emit programmes in which subscribers 
(viewers, listeners) are requested to provide their selection (for example, their 
preference) by means of 'televoting'. The invention provides a system in which subscribers are able to 
make their choice in different programmes with the aid of a simple selection 
system: subscribers who are tuned to a first programme make their choice 
from questions posed in said first programme, subscribers who are tuned to a 
second programme make their choice from questions presented in said second 
programme, etc., this all being done, however, by making use of a simple  
 
system of selection codes no account having to be taken, in selecting the 
desired code, of the programme of which the question presented forms part 
nor of the TV or radio station emitting the programme. The invention is based on the insight that simplicity of operation is 
provided under these circumstances if all the selection questions posed to the 
public in the various programmes are coded by means of a simple coding, 
regardless of programmes or stations. Which code relates to which choice is 
then specified in the programmes themselves when the selection question is 
presented. These features are explained in greater detail below. The invention therefore comprises a system as specified in the first 
paragraph under A. According to the invention, provision is made that the 
processing system is connected, directly or via other means, to a number of 
TV or radio stations which each emit one or

System for transmitting and processing selection codes activated 
by TV or radio subscribers to form selection code signals as a response to 

selection questions presented in TV or radio programmes, such selection codes 
being selected by the TV or radio subscribers, activated and emitted by means 

of a code transmitter, provided with a selection device, and being transmitted 
via a transmission network such as a public telephone network to a processing 

system connected to said transmission network, characterized in that the 
processing system is connected, directly or via other means, to a number of 

TV or radio stations which each emit one or more programmes in which 
selection questions can be presented; in that the selection questions forming 

part of the programmes of the connected TV or radio stations are coded by the 
processing system to form simple selection codes which are part of one series 

of simple selection codes, the selection codes associated with the selection 
questions also being presented in the said programmes during the presentation 

of said selection questions; in that, for each TV or radio subscriber, the code 
transmitter is provided with a selection device which is designed to select 

such selection codes from said simple series of selection codes, such a selected 
selection code being capable of being activated by the subscriber to form a 

selection code signal; in that the processing system comprises a conversion 
device for converting such selection codes, received as selection code signal, 

into response codes to said selection questions, and means for transmitting 
such response codes, or codes which are derived from said response codes, 

such as a plurality of response codes per selection question, in the form of 
signals to each of the connected TV or radio stations.
