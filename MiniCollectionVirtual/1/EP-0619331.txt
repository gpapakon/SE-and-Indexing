<ABSTRACT>
Phenolic resin-modified cyclopentadiene resins which are used as binders for printing inks can advantageously be prepared directly     a) from 20 to 80 % by weight of cyclopentadiene compounds,   b) from 1 to 40 % by weight of rosin acids,   c) from 1 to 60 % by weight of phenols and   d) from 1 to 20 % by weight of aldehydes in the presence of   e) from 0.01 to 1 % by weight of basic alkali metal compounds.   Catalysis by basic alkali metal compounds enables the quantitative reaction of c) and d) in the reaction mixture of a) and b).

claimed in claim 1, which can be prepared in the

presence of from 0.01 to 1 % by weight of basic
lithium compounds.
