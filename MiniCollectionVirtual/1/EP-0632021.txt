<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel antifungal 
compound, and further detailedly relates to a novel azoxy 
compound, a preparation process thereof and a use thereof 
as an antifungal agent. It is already known that Streptomyces sp. 
KC-7367 (FERM BP-1277), a microorganism isolated from 
soil in Maniwa-gun, Okayama-prefecture, Japan produces 
two substances which are represented by the following 
formulae 
and exhibit a strong antifungal activity against fungi 
(US Patent No. 4,981,954 and EP-B-282,001). Further, it is also reported that the 2-imino 
derivative of KA-7367A obtained by imination of the 
carbonyl group at the 2-position of the above antifungal 
substance KA-7367A has a high antifungal activity (US 
Patent No. 5,093,480 and EP-B-396,769). However, although the above compounds KA-7367A 
and B exhibit an excellent antifungal activity, KA-7367A  
 
is unstable, and although the 2-imino derivative of 
KA-7367A is improved in stability as a result of the 
imination, it has a difficulty that its antifungal activity 
is lowered compared with its parent compound 
KA-7367A. As compounds to improve these problems, EP-A-443,513 
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
240766/1991) discloses compounds represented by the 
following formula 
   wherein R₁₁, R₂₁ and R₃₁ are the same or different 
with one another, and each represent a 
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, 
an alkenyl group, a haloalkyl group, an alkoxy 
group, an alkylthio group, an aryl or aralkyl 
group wherein the aromatic ring is optionally 
substituted by 1 to 3 substituents, or a heterocyclic 
group optionally substituted by 1 to 3 
substituents, or R₁₁ and R₂₁ combine to form an 
alkylene group, Y denotes O or NOH provided 
that when R₂₁ (or R₁₁) and R₃₁ denote hydrogen 
atoms simultaneously, R₁₁ (or R₂₁) cannot 
denote an n-butyl group. This invention provides an azoxy compound 
represented by the following general formula     wherein
 
   R₁ denotes a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a 
hydroxyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a lower 
alkoxy-lower alkoxy group or a group of the 
formula X₁-C≡C-CH₂O- wherein X₁ is a hydrogen 
atom or a halogen atom;

group;
 
   R₃ denotes a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl 
group;
 
   R₄ denotes a hydrogen atom or a group of the 
formula X₂-C≡C-CH₂- wherein X₂ is a hydrogen 
atom or a halogen atom;
