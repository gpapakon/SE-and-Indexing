<ABSTRACT>
An integrated accelerometer includes hinges (12, 
14) of silicon composition for securing strut legs of a 

pendulous mass (16) to the accelerometer body (20). 
Both the body of the accelerometer and the pendulous 

mass are of metal-coated compositions. Metallized pads 
(44, 46, 48) are provided on selected surfaces of the 

hinges for forming eutectic bonds with the body and 
struts of the pendulous mass of the accelerometer. A 

heavily-doped continuous region (36) adjacent the 
surface of the hinge connects the eutectic bonds 

through a flexure region of reduced thickness to 
complete necessary device circuitry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated 
accelerometers. Accelerometers of the hinged, pendulous mass, type 
have substantially replaced floated accelerometers in 
modern strapdown inertial navigation systems. Such 
hinged accelerometers offer smaller size, lighter 
weight and simplified construction. Functionally, a 
common type of single axis accelerometer comprises a 
pendulous mass that is suspended within a housing by 
flexure-type hinges. When subjected to acceleration, 
the mass pivots or rotates about the hinge axis thereby 
to shutter the output of a light-emitting diode (LED) 
that is conventionally located adjacent to the non-pivotal 
or "free" end of the mass. This is detected by 
a photodetector circuit. The circuit produces an 
output signal that is proportional to the sensed 
acceleration. Such signal is amplified and the 
resultant current is applied to a torquer coil that is 
mounted to the pendulous mass. The coil reacts with a 
permanent magnet that is affixed to the housing to 
return the mass to a substantially neutral (null) 
position. The torquing current provides a measure of 
the input acceleration. The hinges that suspend the proofmass determine 
two key accelerometer performance factors, shock 
capability and long term bias stability. The cost of 
the accelerometer is, of course, closely related to the 
costs of the various sub-assemblies that comprise the 
accelerometer and to the extent to which assembly labor 
and yield loss can be eliminated through fixturing. Various hinge assemblies and fabrication methods 
have been employed in the past. Hinges formed of 
"ELGILOY" are utilized in the accelerometers disclosed  
 
in United States Patent 4,987,780 of Abbink et al. 
entitled "Integrated Accelerometer Assembly" and in 
pending United States Patent Application 633,260 of 
Abbink et al. entitled "Integrated Accelerometer With 
Durable Sub-Assemblies". The A4 "family" of integrated accelerometers 
manufactured by Litton Systems, Inc., which includes 
the Mod IVD, Mod VIIBR and Mod 7C variations, employs 
many teachings of the above-identified patents. The 
hinges employed in those devices are cut from sheets of 
0.008 to 0.13 cm (0.003 to 0.005 inches) thick ELGILOY. 
A thin flexure portion is first formed by precision 
grinding and the hinge is then tuned. Tuning is an 
electropolishing operation whose end point is reached 
when the appropriate natural frequency of the unmounted 
hinge path is achieved. The hinges are bonded in place 
with EPOXY. In the Mod IVD and
