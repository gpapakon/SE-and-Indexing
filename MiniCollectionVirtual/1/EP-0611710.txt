A device for keeping a conveyor section (90) of an overhead conveyor (1) 
free in an emergency, especially in the region of a fire door (88, 89), with 


a plurality of trolleys (60, 61) held on a roller rail (34) 
a drivable tension strand (19) as the main drive (M) for the trolleys 
(60, 61) 
a plurality of drivers (27, 33; 130) connected to the tension strand 
(19), 
characterised in that
 two detent pawls (43, 44; 131, 132) are 
provided on the drivers and are movable between a working position 

and a free position and in their working position can be alternately 
brought into contact with the trolleys (60, 61), 
at least one rail (38; 137) arranged in a fixed position in the conveyor 
section (90) to be kept clear and acting on each driver (27, 33, 130) 

passing it, for the displacement of that detent pawl (43; 132) not in 
contact with the trolley (60, 61) to its free position, 
an auxiliary drive (109, 141) which can be switched in when the main 
drive (M) is shut down to move a trolley (60, 61), located in the 

conveyor section (90) to be kept free, out of the conveyor section 
(90). 
A device according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the auxiliary drive (109; 141) has a drive module (71, 74, 75) arranged 

below the roller rail (34). 
A device according to claim 2,
characterised in that
 
the drive module (71, 74, 75) is provided with an endless tension member 

(75) with ratchets (79; 142) arranged thereon which can be engaged with 
the trolley (60; 61) to be moved out.  

 
A device according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 
the tension member (75) is arranged in part within a space (35) enclosed by 

the roller rail (34). 
A device according to one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that
 
the auxiliary drive (109; 141) has an electric motor (68) which is connected 

to a circuit (108) which is independent of the main drive (M) in a controllable 
manner. 
A device according to one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that
 
the auxiliary drive (109) is in the form of an energy-storage drive (110). 
A device according to claim 6,
characterised in that
 
the energy-storage drive (110) has an electromagnetic triggering device 

(118) which is connected to the independent circuit (108) (M) in a 
controllable manner. 
A device according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
a carrier (12) holding the rail (38; 137) is provided with attachment points 

(16, 138) arranged differently.
