<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor element module of the invention comprises a 
sleeve (1), a stem (31), a semiconductor light-emitting or 

light-receiving element (41), and a converging lens (20). 
In the sleeve (1), a fitting portion (11) in which a 

ferrule for positioning an optical fiber is to be fitted is 
formed from its one open end toward the interior, an 

element housing portion (13) coaxial with the fitting 
portion (11) is formed from the other open end toward the 

interior, and a lens holding portion (12) is formed to 
connect the fitting portion (11) and the element housing 

portion (13). The stem (31) is fixed to the sleeve (1) at 
the other open end. The semiconductor light-emitting or 

light-receiving element (41) is fixed on a surface of the 
stem (31) on the element housing portion side. The 

converging lens (20) is housed in the lens holding portion 
and fixed to the sleeve (1), and optically couples an end 

face of the optical fiber to the light-emitting end face of 
the semiconductor light-emitting element (41) or the light-receiving 

end face of the semiconductor light-receiving 
element (41). The material constituting the sleeve (1) 

includes a metal having a thermal expansion coefficient 
close to that of a material constituting the converging 

lens (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
element module used in a reception unit and a
transmission unit in an optical communication system.An optical communication system using an optical
fiber technique has been attracting attention in recent
years. Since light-emitting and light-receiving elements
are generally very small and are inconvenient for use as
they are, they are usually provided in a semiconductor
element module. A sleeve is formed in this semiconductor
element module to connect this module to a ferrule having
an optical fiber inserted therein.A light-emitting diode is generally used as a
light-emitting element. Since emitted light diffuses,
the light is generally converged by a lens and guided into
the optical fiber. Since light emitting from the end face
of the optical fiber also diffuses, a lens must be
provided between the optical fiber and the
light-receiving element, thereby improving the ratio of
light guided to the light-receiving element.Hence, a lens must be provided between a
semiconductor element, e.g., a light-emitting or 
light-receiving element, and the optical fiber. An
example of conventional modules has a structure in which
a lens is directly provided to a semiconductor element
(e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-165312 and the
like). And the other example has a structure in which a
lens is provided in a module. When a lens is provided in
a module, a metal holder 101 holding a lens 120 therein,
as shown in Fig. 1, is mounted to a sleeve (not shown)
which is formed separately from the metal holder 101. To
hold a lens in a metal holder, a lens is held on a metal
cylinder or the like.At this time, SUS430 which is a material having a
thermal expansion coefficient close to that of a glass
material constituting the lens is used as the material of
the metal cylinder holding the lens. And an SUS303-based
material having a good machining performance is used as
the material constituting the sleeve.Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 2, a light-emitting
element is hermetically sealed by using a cap 201 that
fixes a lens 220, and the cap 201 is mounted to a sleeve. In DE-A-40 22 076 a semiconductor element having an optical
semiconductor and an optical fiber receptacle into which an
optical fiber ferrule may be inserted is described, but without solving
the problems of adhesion between the optical element
receptacle and the optical fiber ferrule. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
semiconductor element module for optical communication
which has a small number
