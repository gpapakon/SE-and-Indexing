<ABSTRACT>
Signalling light for motor vehicles, of the type comprising a reflector (1), having reliefs, and an incandescent lamp (2), and the front face of which is closed by a translucent diffuser provided with lenses, characterised in that the reflector comprises a series of parallel striae (4) having a width of the order of 0.5 mm to form a diffusing reflector, whereas the diffuser has, on its face turned towards the reflector, a series of parallel contiguous cylindrical lenses (7) having dimensions greater than those of the striae (4), the said lenses extending in a direction which is orthogonal with respect to the striae.

A signalling lamp for motor vehicles of the type 
comprising a reflector (1) with reliefs (4) on its 

surface, an incandescent bulb (2) and a diffuser (5) 
closing the front face of the reflector (1) and in which 

the face turned towards the said reflector (1) is 
provided with parallel cylindrical lenses extending in a 

direction orthogonal in relation to the reliefs, 

characterised in that
 the reliefs of the reflector (1) 
are formed by a series of parallel serrations (4) having 

a width in the order of 0.5 mm, whereas the parallel 
cylindrical lenses of the diffuser (5) are adjacent to 

one another without providing any space between them and 
have dimensions greater than those of the serrations (4). 
A signalling lamp for motor vehicles according to Claim 
1,
characterised in that
 the serrations (4) are formed by 
stepped grooves. 
A signalling lamp for motor vehicles according to Claim 
1,
characterised in that
 the serrations (4) are formed by 
grooves having convex radii. 
A signalling lamp for motor vehicles according to Claim 
1,
characterised in that
 the serrations (4) are formed by 
grooves having concave radii. 
A signalling lamp for motor vehicles according to Claim 
1,
characterised in that
 the serrations (4) have facets 
(4a).  

 
A signalling lamp for motor vehicles according to Claim 
1,
characterised in that
 the cylindrical lenses have a span 
in the order of 6 mm.
