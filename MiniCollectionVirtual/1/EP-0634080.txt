Process for routing telecommunication calls in a 
meshed line switching network, in which the telecommunication 

calls from a transmitting-end telecommunication 
terminal (A) are routed via an originating node 

(ON), via transit nodes (TN1, ... TN7) and a destination 

node (DN) to a receiving-end telecommunication terminal 
(B), and in which it is checked in transit nodes (TN1, 

... TN7) on the basis of first information identifying 
the destination node (DN) whether a telecommunication 

call to the destination node (DN) is permitted, and in 
which second information identifying the originating node 

(ON) is inserted into signalling information assigned to 
the telecommunication call to be established, characterized 

in that the node (TN(n+x), DN) which is immediately 
next on the route is determined in transit nodes (TNn) on 

the basis of the second and first information. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, for the telecommunication call to be established, 

in transit nodes (TNn) to which the telecommunication 
call is routed, in each case third information identifying 

the respective transit node (TNn) is inserted into 
the signalling information assigned to the telecommunication 

call, and in that in transit nodes (TNn) to which 
the telecommunication call is routed, the node (TN(n+x)) 

which is immediately next on the route is determined on 
the basis of the first, second and third information. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that in the case of the telecommunication 

call to be established, in each node to which the  
 

telecommunication call to be established is routed, the 
number of nodes previously passed through is incremented 

by the number "1", in that said number incremented by "1" 
is compared with a predeterminable first threshold value, 

and in that the call to be established is then only 
routed to a further node if the number incremented by "1" 

is less than or equal to the first threshold value. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the telecommunication call to be 

established is routed between in each case two nodes (ON, 
TN1; TN1, TN2; ...) via satellites, in that the number of 

connection path sections routed between two nodes (ON; 
TN1; TN1, TN2; ...) via satellites is counted and compared 

with a second threshold value in the nodes (TN1, 
... TN7, DN), and in that the telecommunication call to 

be established is then only routed to a further node via 
satellites if the number of connection path sections 

routed via satellites is less than or equal to the second 
threshold value. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that any node (ON, TN1, ... TN7, DN) of 

the network can be connected to a network-external 
transmitting-end telecommunication terminal (A'), in that 

said node (ON, TN1, ... TN7, DN) inserts its own second 
information indicating a fictitious originating node for 

this telecommunication terminal (A') into the telecommunication 
call.
