<ABSTRACT>
The outer and inner pipe systems are made up of individual inner and outer pipes. The inner pipe system is supported concentrically in the outer pipe system by support elements (44) which adjoin a surface of the inner and/or outer pipe running inclined or across the axis of the pipe line system. The support elements each support at least one pipe part (16) of the inner pipe system (12) in axial direction. The support elements can be designed as circumferentially distributed webs interconnected and resting on the outside on a shoulder (38) of an outer pipe (32). The support elements can be integral with the pipe part of the inner pipe system and rest outside on a shoulder of the outer pipe.

Double-walled piping system (10) especially for a chimney 
for exhaust air and gas, with an inner piping system (12) 

which is concentrically arranged in an outer piping system 
(14) by means of distance spacers, the inner piping system 

(12) showing longitudinally movable inner pipe parts 
inserted into each other and the outer piping system (14) 

showing separate outer pipes (32) with a shoulder-like 
portion (38) with surfaces extending obliquely or 

transversely to the axis of the piping system (10),
characterized in
 that 

the inner piping system (12) shows separate first inner 
pipes (18) inserted in pipe connectors and second inner 

pipes (20), 
that the distance spacers are shaped as supporting elements 
sustaining the pipe connectors (16) in the axial direction 

on the shoulder-like portions (38), 
that respectively the second inner pipe (20) inserted from 
the top into a pipe connector (16) is supported on this 

pipe connector and that the length of a first inner pipe 
(18) inserted in a pipe connector (16) is respectively 

reduced by the amount of the highest expectable 
longitudinal extension so that each inner pipe is 

respectively separately supported. 
Double-walled piping system according to claim 1,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements (44, 62) are arranged in the area 

of a connection of two outer pipes (32, 34; 52, 34 
respectively 32, 52) of the outer piping system (14). 
Double-walled piping system according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements (44, 62) have the shape of webs 

spread over the circumference. 
Double-walled piping system according to one of the claims 
1 to 3,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements (44, 62) are connected with each 

other and rest outside on the shoulder-like portion (38) of 
an outer pipe (32) and that surfaces extending obliquely or 

transversely to the axis are arranged on an inner pipe, on 
which the inner pipe rests on the supporting elements (44, 

62). 
Double-walled piping system according to one of claims 1 to 
3,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements (44) are carried out in one piece 

with a pipe connector (16). 
Double-walled piping system according to claim 5,
characterized in
 that
 
the pipe connector (16) is muff-like shaped in the area of 

both end portions and shows a jut (22) on its inner wall. 
Double-walled piping system according to one of claims 1 to 
3,
characterized in
 that
 
the suporting elements (44, 62) are arranged at an end 

portion of a pipe connector (16) i.e. of an inner pipe bend 
(50) into which another inner pipe (18, 20) can be 

inserted. 
Double-walled piping system according to claim 6 or 7,
characterized in
 that
 
near the free end of the end portion of a pipe connector 

(16) i.e. of an inner pipe bend (50) a rotating bead (24, 
26, 60) is fixed in which a sealing ring (28, 30) is laid 

in. 
Double-walled piping system according to claim 8,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements (44, 62) are arranged in the area  

 
of the bead (24, 26, 60). 
Double-walled piping system according to one of the claim 
1 to 9,
characterized in
 that
 
the outer piping system (14) consists of outer pipes (32, 

34, 52) which are muff-like widened at one end connecting 
with a shoulder-like portion (38) to which the supporting 

elements (44, 62) are adjacent. 
Double-walled piping system according to claim 10,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements are connected with a ring adjacent 

to a shoulder-like portion (38). 
Double-walled piping system according to one of claims 1 to 
3,
characterized in
 that
 
the supporting elements are turned to the inside and 

carried out in one piece with an outer pipe and that, on an 
inner pipe part resting on the supporting elements, 

surfaces are arranged which extend obliquely or 
transversely to the axis.
