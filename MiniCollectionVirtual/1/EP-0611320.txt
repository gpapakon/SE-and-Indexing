<ABSTRACT>
A wheel for use in a toy building set comprises a tire for mounting on a rim with a substantially cylindrical mounting face. The tire is formed as a ring with a substantially cylindrical engagement face directed toward the rim. The outer surface of the tire is asymmetric about its central plane perpendicular to the wheel axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a wheel for use in a toy building 
set and comprising a tire for mounting on a rim with a 
substantially cylindrical mounting face. Various vehicles have always been among the basic structures 
which it should desirably be possible to build with 
the interconnectible elements of a toy building set. As 
more and more elements for the toy building sets are developed, 
it is possible to build models which resemble real 
vehicles to an ever greater degree. Thus, greater requirements 
are now also made by the consumer since it is now no 
longer satisfactory to use the same wheel for a model of 
e.g. a loader tractor and another model of e.g. a passenger 
car. US-A-3 642 048 describes an 
example of the structure of a wheel of the above-mentioned 
type. The object of the invention is to provide a wheel structure 
for use in a toy building set which can be used in 
connection with various models of vehicles in a manner 
such that the wheels contribute to a realistic overall 
appearance of the vehicle. This object is achieved as stated in the characterizing 
portion of claim 1 because the tire is asymmetric. When 
the tire is seen in its radial direction, the actual 
"tread" will be approximately symmetric, while the asymmetry 
of the tire entails that one side approximately exposes 
the rim and the hub, while the rim and part of the 
hub toward the other side are covered. As the tire is 
turnable, the wheel will seem to have a thin tire from one 
side, while, when the tire is turned, the corresponding 
wheel will pretend to have a very thick tire. Thus, with  
 
simple means it is possible for the user to use the same 
components in two widely different models where the wheels 
still support the intended general impression. In the preferred embodiment the tire is made of an elastic 
material, e.g. rubber, and can be received slidably in the 
axial direction on the rim. Usually, it is not necessary, 
but may be expedient in some cases to provide the contact 
faces between the tire and the rim with an annular bead 
and a groove to receive the bead. The wheel part on which the tire is mounted, preferably 
comprises a cylindrical rim which is integral with a hub 
via a disc-shaped wheel part. The hub usually also has a 
cylindrical part for rotatable reception of a shaft part, 
e.g. shaped as a screw whereby the wheel can be attached 
to other elements incorporated in the toy building set. In the preferred embodiment the tire is cylindrical and 
open at one end, so that the rest of the wheel

<CLAIMS>
A wheel for use in a toy building set and comprising a 
rim (12) having a substantially cylindrical mounting face 

and two rim sides as well as a tire (10) having a substantially 
cylindrical engagement face facing toward the rim 

(12), said tire having an annular bead (11; 21), 
characterized
 
in that the tire (10) has an outer 

surface which is asymmetric about its central plane perpendicular 
to the wheel axis, that the annular bead (11; 

21), when the tire (10) is mounted on the rim (12), extends 
inwardly across said rim (12) in radial direction of 

the wheel, and that the rim sides in the area around the 
bead (11; 21) of the tire (10) are positioned within the 

cylindrical body formed by the mounting face, whereby the 
tire (10) is turnable. 
A wheel according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the central plane of the tire (10) corresponds 

to the central plane of the rim (12). 
A wheel according to claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the tire (10) is made of an elastic material, 

and that the rim (12) and the tire (10) are formed 
with an annular groove (22) and a bead (24), respectively, 

in the engagement faces at respective central planes. 
A wheel according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the rim (12) is connected with a hub (14) 

through a disc-shaped wheel (13) part perpendicular to the 
wheel axis. 
A wheel according to claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that a shaft part (16) shaped as a screw is 

rotatably received in the hub (14) by means of which the  
 

wheel can be secured to other elements incorporated in the 
toy building set. 
A wheel according to claims 1-5, 
characterized
 
in that the tire (10) is shaped as a cylinder 

which is open at one end and partly closed at the other 
end, the bead (11; 21) of the tire (10) forms an inwardly 

facing flange that forms an engagement face for the edges 
of the rim (12). 
A wheel according to claim 6, 
characterized
 
in that the flange is formed with an internal 

bead to provide an annular channel in which one of the 
edges of the rim (12) can be received. 
A wheel according to claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that the distance from the outer edge of the 

flange to the disc-shaped wheel part (13) corresponds to 
the depth of the annular channel. 
A wheel according to claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that the hub (14) and the rim (12) are additionally 

connected with stiffening elements (23) in the 
radial direction of the wheel, and that the distance from 

the inner edge of the rim (12) to the stiffening elements 
(23) corresponds to the depth of the annular channel. 
A wheel according to claim 5, wherein the screw has a 
threaded end, 
characterized
 in that the screw 
end facing away from the threaded end has a stop (18) preventing 

axial movement of the hub, and that an annular 
bead (17; 26) is provided between the stop (18) and the 

threads so that the hub, when displaced in the axial 
direction, can be moved over the bead and be retained in 

snap manner between the stop (18) and the bead (17; 26).
