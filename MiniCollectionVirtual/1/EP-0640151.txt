<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to forming a solder bump on an 
integrated circuit die. More particularly, this invention relates 
to such method that includes reflowing the solder alloy onto a 
terminal formed of an electrically conductive, solder-wettable 
composite material composed of copper particles and a 
polymeric binder. In the manufacture of a microelectronic device, it is 
known to mount an integrated circuit die to a printed circuit 
board or the like by a plurality of solder bump 
interconnections that not only physically attach the die, but 
also electrically connect a circuit on the die to a circuit on the 
board for conducting electrical signals to and from the die for 
processing. For this purpose, a metal pad is formed on the die. 
A body of solder alloy, such as a preformed microball, is placed 
onto the pad, heated and cooled to reflow the solder to form a 
bump that is attached to the die. The area about the pad is 
covered by a material that is not wet by the solder to prevent 
the solder from spreading across the surface. The die is then 
assembled with the board such that the bump rests upon a 
terminal on the board, whereafter the assembly is heated to 
reflow the solder, thereby bonding the bump to the board to 
complete the interconnection. The design of an integrated circuit die is relatively costly 
and includes the expense of designing and fabricate numerous 
masks to arrange and build up the many electrical features. In 
the past, terminals have been placed adjacent to the perimeter 
to facilitate wire bonding. Frequently, it is desired to utilize a  
 
conventional die, which features perimeter terminals for wire 
bonding, in a package that includes solder bump 
interconnections. However, the crowding of the terminals 
about the perimeter restricts the size of each bump, thereby 
making it more difficult to handle and accurately position the 
solder on the terminals and interfering with the formation of 
discrete bumps. Thus, it is desired to redistribute the terminal 
pads across the die surface to permit larger bumps to be 
employed. Common processes for applying and patterning 
additional metallic layers significantly contribute to the cost of 
the die. Accordingly, it is desired to provide a relatively simple 
and inexpensive method for redistributing terminal pads on an 
integrated circuit die to facilitate solder bump interconnections, 
while avoiding the expense of redesigning the die. This invention contemplates an improved method for 
forming a solder bump on a terminal
