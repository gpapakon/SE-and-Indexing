<ABSTRACT>
In the process described, a secondary N-monoalkylpolyhydroxyamine is reacted with an aldehyde in a molar ratio of 1 to 0.9-1.5 in water as a solvent and in the presence of a metallic hydrogenation catalyst at a hydrogen pressure of 10 to 150 bar and a temperature of 70 to 150@C, preferably in two reaction steps, to give the tertiary dialkylpolyhydroxyamine. Using the process according to the invention, tertiary polyhydroxyamines, preferably in the form of di-C1 to C6-alkylglycamines, are obtained in high yield and purity.

A process for the preparation of tertiary dialkylpolyhydroxy-amines, 
comprising 


a) reacting a secondary N-monoalkylpolyhydroxy-amine 
in the first step with an aldehyde in a molar 

ratio of 1 : from 0.9 to 1.5 in water as solvent 
at a temperature of from 15 to 60째C and at 

atmospheric pressure to give the N-monoalkylpolyhydroxy-amine/aldehyde 
adduct, and 
b) hydrogenating the reaction product obtained in 
step a) in the presence of Raney nickel as 

hydrogenation catalyst with hydrogen at a 
pressure of from 10 to 150 bar and at a 

temperature of from 70 to 150째C to give the 
tertiary dialkylpolyhydroxy-amine. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein in 
step a) the secondary N-monoalkylpolyhydroxy-amine 

and the aldehyde are employed in a molar ratio of 
1 : from 1.03 to 1.1 and are reacted at a 

temperature of from 20 to 40째C to give the adduct, 
and in step b) the adduct is hydrogenated at a 

hydrogen pressure of from 30 to 100 bar and at a 
temperature of from 80 to 130째C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
a secondary N-mono-C
1
 to C
6
-alkylglycamine and 
formaldehyde or acetaldehyde are employed.
