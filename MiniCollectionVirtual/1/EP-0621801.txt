<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aminoalkylphosphonic acid 
containing ligands covalently bonded to inorganic solid 
supports and to processes for removing, separating and 
concentrating certain desired ions from solutions 
wherein such ions may be admixed with other ions which 
may be present in much higher concentrations by the use 
of such aminoalkylphosphonic acid containing ligands as 
supported materials. More particularly, this invention 
relates to a process for removing such ions from an 
admixture with others in solution by forming a complex 
of the desired ions with compounds composed of 
aminoalkylphosphonic acid containing ligands bonded to 
an inorganic matrix by flowing such solutions through a 
column packed with such aminoalkylphosphonic acid 
containing solid ligand supported materials and then 
selectively breaking the complex of the desired ion from 
the compounds to which such ion has become attached by 
flowing a receiving liquid in much smaller volume than 
the volume of solution passed through the column to 
remove and concentrate the desired ions in solution in 
the receiving liquid. The concentrated ions thus 
removed may then be recovered by known methods. Effective methods for the recovery and/or 
separation of particular transition and post transition 
metal cations from each other and from other cations 
from solutions thereof, admixed with chelating agents  
 
and/or other ions which may be present, represent a real 
need in modern technology. As specific examples, efficient 
and economical separaton of (1) ppm levels of Sb from 
concentrated Cu, Ni, Zn, Ag, or other metal cations under 
acidic conditions; (2) separation of Zr(IV), Pu(IV), and 
Hf(IV) from HN03 solutions containing large amounts of 
other metal cations; and (3) separation of Cu, Ni, Fe, Zn, 
Cd, Ag, Pb and Hg as toxic wastes from potable water or 
industrial effluents, all represent real separation needs 
with presently either unsatisfactory technologies for their 
accomplishment, or for which more economical technologies 
are desired. These ions are often present at low 
concentrations in solutions containing other ions at much 
greater concentrations. Hence, there is a real need for a 
process to selectively concentrate and recover these ions. EP-A 121 337 describes ligand - solid resin support materials 
carrying covalently bonded aminoalkylphosphonic acid groups 
and the use of such supports for removing metal ions from 
solutions. U.S. Patent No. 3,696,012 describes a method of adsorptive 
removal of Sb and
