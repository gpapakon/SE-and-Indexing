<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metallo-organic
cobalt compounds and their use in the treatment of subjects
for conditions and diseases caused by viruses and viral
infections. It has been discovered that certain conditions
and diseases, e.g., inflammation, burns, wounds, and diseases
caused by bacteria and fungi in mammalian species can be
treated with certain complexes of cobalt having the
structure: 
wherein each A may be the same or different and is an alkyl
group, a phenyl group or a substituted derivative of a phenyl
group;wherein each Y may be the same or different and is hydrogen,
an unbranched alkyl group, a halide or a group having the
structure

wherein R is hydrogen, an alkoxide group, an
alkyl group, or OH;wherein each B may be the same or different and each is hydrogen
or an alkyl group;wherein each X may be the same or different and each is a
water soluble group having weak to intermediate ligand field
strength; andZ- is a soluble, pharmaceutically acceptable negative ion.Today, virus infections are known to be significant
causes of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary 
medicine. Many of these diseases are untreatable or the
available therapies are not entirely satisfactory and only
provide minimal clinical response. For the most part, it is
known that viral diseases do not respond to therapy with
conventional antibiotics. Despite some recent successes in
the development of antiviral chemical therapeutic agents, new
treatments for these diseases are needed to improve the
management of viral infections in clinical medicine.Parent application Serial No. 502,294, referred to
hereinabove, discloses the use of the foregoing described
compounds as antiviral agents.US-A-5 049 557 discloses mixed Shiff base complexes of cobalt, wherein the neutral
ligands X and X' are the same or different and each is a water soluble group having
weak to intermediate ligand field strength. In Polish J. Chem. 1990, 305-316 there are
monodentate heterocyclic ligands in cobalt complexes described.I have now discovered a series of new compounds
having the structure:
  
wherein
each Amay be the same or different and is an alkyl group,
a phenyl group or a substituted derivative of a
phenyl group;each Ymay be the same or different and is hydrogen, an
unbranched alkyl group, a halide or a group having
the structure

wherein R is hydrogen, an
alkoxide group, an alkyl group, or OH;each Bmay be the same or different and each is hydrogen
or an alkyl group;Z-is a soluble, pharmaceutically acceptable negative ion,
