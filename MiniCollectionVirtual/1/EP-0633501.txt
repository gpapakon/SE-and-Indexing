In an image forming method, a photosensitive 
material comprises a photosensitive layer and a 

polymerisable layer which are laminated. An area of the 
polymerisable layer, corresponding to an unexposed area 

of the photosensitive layer, is polymerised when the 
photosensitive material is exposed to light, preferably 

with a wavelength of 400 to 900 nm, and heated to 60 to 
80°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive 
material and to an image forming method. More 
particularly it is concerned with a photosensitive 
material having a photosensitive and heat-developable 
layer and a polymerizable layer, so that the material is 
capable of forming a polymer image having superior 
contrast, value and chroma. Energies used to form or record an image include 
light, sound, electricity, magnetism, heat, radiations 
such as electron rays and X-rays, and chemical energy. 
Among these, in particular, widely used are light, 
electricity, heat energy, or a combination of any of 
these. For example, a image forming method that employs the 
combination of light energy with chemical energy includes 
a silver salt photographic process and a method in which 
a diazo copying paper is used. The  
 
method that employs the combination of light energy 
with electric energy includes an electrophotographic 
system. The method that utilizes heat energy includes 
a method in which a thermo-sensitive recording paper 
or transfer recording paper is used. On the other 
hand, known as the method that utilizes electric 
energy is a method in which an electrostatic recording 
paper, electrothermal recording paper, or 
electrosensitive recording paper is used. Of the above image forming methods, a silver 
salt photographic process can obtain an image having a 
high resolution. The silver salt photographic 
process, however, requires developing and fixing 
treatments that use complicated liquid compositions, 
or a drying treatment of an image (or a print). Now, development is energetically made on 
image forming methods that can form an image through a 
simple processing. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,629,676 teaches 
a method in which a polymerization reaction under dry 
(thermal) conditions is caused by a photosensitive 
reaction of silver halide that acts as a trigger, to 
form an image comprising a polymer. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 62-70836 
also discloses a method which comprises forming 
a latent image comprising silver metal produced from  
 
silver halide by imagewise exposure, and converting, 
under heating, a reducing agent into an oxidized 
product having a polymerization inhibitory power 
different from that of said reducing agent by 
utilizing a catalytic action of the above silver 
metal, thereby producing a difference in the 
polymerization inhibitory power between the reducing 
agent and the resulting oxidized product and also 
causing a thermal polymerization
