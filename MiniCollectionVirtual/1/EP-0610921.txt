<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
color photographic material, and more particularly to a 
silver halide color photographic material with an excellent 
tone reproducibility suitable for the duplication of a 
positive original. Color photographic light-sensitive materials which are 
now widespread fall into two main groups, i.e., color 
photographic light-sensitive materials for picture taking such 
as color negative film, color reversal film and color instant 
film and color photographic light-sensitive materials for 
printing the recorded image for observation such as color 
paper, reversal paper and display film. Among these color 
photographic light-sensitive materials for picture taking, 
positive type photographic light-sensitive martials such as 
color reversal film and instant film are double-purpose 
photographic light-sensitive materials which can be put into 
use for picture taking as well as observation. Photographic 
light-sensitive materials only for picture taking cannot make 
the picture taken observable without any corresponding printing 
materials. Thus, these photographic light-sensitive materials 
for picture taking essentially need the subsequent use of such 
printing materials. For the foregoing double-purpose  
 
photographic light-sensitive materials as well, printing 
materials (duplicating materials) are required in the case 
where it is desired to prevent the original from being damaged, 
e.g., in the case where it is stored as a valuable original or 
processed as a printing original, or in the case where an 
enlarged duplicate or a plurality of duplicates are needed. These printing materials can be roughly divided into 
two groups. Typical examples of these printing materials 
include color reversal paper or color auto positive paper which 
makes the printed image observable on reflected light from a 
reflective support and color duplicating film or display film 
which makes the printed image observable by means of 
transmitted light or projected image through a transparent or 
translucent support. Among these printing materials, the color 
duplicating film can make the printed image observable by means 
of transmitted light simultaneously with its original 
positioned side by side and thus requires quite the same image 
quality as the original. The color duplicating film is further 
practically required to provide an image faithfully duplicating 
the original. That is, the color duplicating film is required 
to serve as a printing original or a stock
