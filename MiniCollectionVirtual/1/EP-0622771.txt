<ABSTRACT>
A relatively large amount of information can be scanned piecewise by means of a movable display device whose display area offers tactile information to one or more fingers. The subject-matter of the invention is a display device whose scanning elements (tactile elements), which are not laterally moveable, are shaped and arranged in such a manner and controlled so that during lateral displacement of the information presented a similar scanning impression is produced as when the fingers slide over the stationary tactile information. In the display area (1) movable scanning pins (6) are arranged in such a manner that in at least one dimension the distance between neighbouring scanning pins amounts to not more than 1.6 mm. Piezoelectric bending strips (7) are controlled in such a manner by the phase-related connection of an alternating voltage that they can exert a number of different forces on the supported fingers by means of the scanning pins (6). The bending strips (7) and the electronic switches (10) are mounted on printed circuit boards (8). Driving the scanning pins can optionally be carried out in such a manner that the virtual total information seems either to be stationary or to be moving in the direction opposite to the movement of the display area.
