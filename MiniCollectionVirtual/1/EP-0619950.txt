<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for fractionating oats to 
obtain a stable, soluble oat protein containing aqueous solution, the process 

comprising: preparing an aqueous slurry comprising water and an oat 
substrate; fractionating the oat substrate by maintaining the slurry at a 

sufficient temperature and treating the slurry with sufficient agitation, 
suffici
ent base or acid to adjust the pH of the aqueous slurry to outside the 
isoelectric range, and sufficient protease to hydrolyze sufficient oat protein, 

thereby obtaining a translucent slurry which comprises an insoluble solid 
fraction, an insoluble liquid fraction, a stable, soluble oat protein fraction, a 

soluble oat fat fraction, and a soluble oat carbohydrate fraction; and removing 
the insoluble liquid fraction and the insoluble solid fraction from the slurry, 

thereby recovering a final transparent, low fat, stable aqueous solution 
comprising water and a stable, soluble oat protein fraction, a soluble oat fat 

fraction, and a soluble oat carbohydrate fraction. The present invention 
further relates to the aqueous solution of the above process and a stable, 

soluble oat protein fraction in purified form.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a low fat,
transparent, stable oat protein containing aqueous solution. The present
invention also relates to the aqueous solution product of this process and a
solid, purified oat protein containing mixture which when placed in solution
provides for a transparent, stable oat protein containing aqueous solution.The oat seed from which the oat grain is taken comprises an oat hull
and an oat groat. The oat hull serves as an outer covering of the groat. The
oat groat is comprised of oat bran, including the pericarp and the aleurone
layers, germ and endosperm. It is desirable to fractionate the oat groat into
its soluble and insoluble fractions because each fraction of the groat has value
in and of itself. Specifically of interest in the present invention is the water
soluble fraction of the groat, including its water soluble oat protein fraction.
The soluble oat protein fraction has many beneficial uses, including use in
cosmetics; hair care and skin care formulations such as lotions, shampoos,
creams and gels; ready-to-eat cereal products to enhance their flavor and
texture; and in preparing meals for controlled diets such as restricted hospital
meals, infant formula, and special nutritional formulations such as high protein
beverages.Furthermore, oat protein has a higher nutritional value than other cereal
proteins because of its larger and more balanced concentration of essential
amino acids. Amino acids are essential to human life because they are the
basic materials for forming the required protein. If the oat protein is isolatable,
one has a suitable material for adding protein content to a variety of foods or
forming a desirable protein component.Also of interest are low fat, oat protein containing aqueous solutions
and solid mixtures used to prepare aqueous solutions. These are useful as
additives and protein supplements in low fat food items. Additionally, it is 
believed that such low fat oat protein containing compositions and mixtures
will be more stable since they are likely less susceptible to rancidity. This is
because they contain less fat for oxidation, which is the cause of rancidity.
Unfortunately, such low fat oat protein containing compositions are also
translucent, and therefore are not aesthetically pleasing when added to clear
formulations such as beverages.Furthermore, low fat, oat protein containing solutions have a greater
concentration of protein as compared to full fat formulations. This translates
into a greater protein
