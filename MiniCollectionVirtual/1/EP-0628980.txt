<ABSTRACT>
A device for interrupting the current supplied by a motor vehicle 
battery (B), comprising an inertia switch (5) controlling a relay 

(3) associated with a normally closed mechanical power switch (2) 
connected into the feed line to the vehicle electrical 

installation (6). The operation of said inertia switch 
determines the energization of said relay, causing the opening of 

said mechanical power switch and the operation of a further relay 
(13) arranged to ensure that auxiliary warning and safety services 

(20,21,22) are set to or maintained in a state favourable to the 
safety or protection of the occupants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for interrupting the current supplied by a motor 
vehicle battery, according to the preamble of claim 1. An object of the invention is to provide a device of the aforesaid type which not 
only allows immediate disconnection of the battery from the general services panel 
and in particular the interruption of the hot lines so as to avoid the danger of fire by 
short-circuiting in the case of accidents, but also acts on certain auxiliary services 
such as the hazard and courtesy lights, rear safety lights, motorized window 
operators, door releasers etc., to set them to a position of safety for the occupants. Document CH 499412 describes a battery cut off device comprising an inertia 
switch connected to a single rel√© which, in the case of a vehicle's accident, 
operates both a first switch, for automatically switching off of the power line 
connected to the vehicle electrical installation, and a second switch for 
automatically switch on the blinkers of the vehicle. A further object of the invention is to provide a device which prevents the gasoline 
pump remaining in operation after an accident involving a collision. These and further objects of the invention will be apparent to an expert of the art 
on reading the following description and attached claims, the latters defining the 
scope of protection of the invention. The device is illustrated in schematic form in the single accompanying figure.  
 With reference to said schematic diagram, the device is contained within a box 
casing, shown by dashed lines and indicated by 1, and consists of a power switch 2 
maintained closed by a mechanical anchorage so as to provide electrical power to 
the general services panel 6' and hence to the vehicle electrical installation. The switch 2 is controlled by a relay 3 connected via a static switch 4 to a normally 
open inertia switch 5, for example of the type manufactured by First Inertia Switch 
Ltd. (UK). The device connects the auxiliary services 6 to the positive of the battery B via 
contactors 11 which are shown here as switches for reasons of simplicity. In normal operation the auxiliary services 6 are operated by the user depending on 
his requirements, for example these auxiliary services can be hazard lights 20, door 
releasers 21, window operators 22 etc., these services being independent of the 
power switch 2. Following a vehicle collision, for example due to an accident, the inertia switch 5 
closes and via a resistor 7 operates the control electrode of the

<CLAIMS>
A device for interrupting the current supplied by a motor vehicle battery, 
comprising an inertia switch (5) controlling a first relay (3) associated with a 

normally closed mechanical power switch (2) connected into the feed line to the 
vehicle electrical installation (6'), and controlling first contacts (14) connected to 

auxiliary warning and safety services (20, 21, 22), the operation of said inertia 
switch determining the energization of said first relay, causing the opening of said 

mechanical power switch, and the setting or maintaining in a state favourable to the 
safety or protection of the occupants of the warning and safety services (20, 21, 

22) connected to said first contacts (14); characterised in that it comprises a 
second relay (13) connected to said inertia switch (5) and said first contacts (14), 

the operation of said inertia switch determining the energization of said second 
relay (13) causing the setting or maintaining of said services (20, 21, 22) in a state 

favourable to the safety of the occupants.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the auxiliary services (20, 
21, 22) are connected between said power switch (2) and a pole of a battery (B), 

and are conventionally controlled by contactor means (11) short-circuited by the 
second relay (13) on operation of the inertia switch (5). 
A device as claimed in the preceding claims, characterised in that said 
mechanical power switch (2) can be closed by a manual push-button (9). 
A device as claimed in the preceding claims, characterised by comprising a 
manual mechanical switch (10) for excluding said first relay (3). 
A device as claimed in the preceding claims, characterised by comprising a 
manual electrical switch (8) for energizing said first relay (3). 
A device as claimed in one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the closure of the inertia switch (5) causes operation of switching means (25) 

positioned between the conventional alternator (23) and the electrical gasoline feed 
pump.
