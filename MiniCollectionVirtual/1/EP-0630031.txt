<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to improved thick film
paste compositions and particularly to such compositions which
are water cleanable and have good rheological characteristics for
thick film printing.Using thick film technology to add one or more thin
layers of inorganic film onto a substrate is important in a variety
of commercial applications including the manufacture of
microelectronic circuits and automotive window defoggers. The
layers are made by printing a thick film paste onto a substrate
using a screen printer, drying the layer at low temperature
(<200°C) to remove volatile solvents and then firing the layer at
high temperature (>600°C) to remove all other noninorganic
components and densify the inorganic components. Thick film
microelectronic circuits are prepared by applying layers of
conductor and dielectric to a substrate which is usually alumina.
The layers of conductor are connected to each other through
small holes (vias) in the dielectric layer which are filled with
conductor. An alternative to separately firing each printed and
dried layer is to print and dry several layers which are then fired
together. This process is called cofiring. An example of
separately firing each layer can be found in automotive window
defogger technology. Typically the screenprinted conductor
traces on the glass substrate are fired then decorative enamels
are printed and fired. Thick film pastes are dispersions of inorganic
particles in a liquid vehicle phase. This vehicle phase contains
predominantly polymers, solvents and other miscellaneous
additives. The inorganic particles can be conductive (e.g., gold,
silver, copper), dielectric (e.g., glass, refractory oxides) or
resistive (e.g., RuO2 pyrochlore). The polymer in a thick film
paste serves at least the following functions: imparts proper
printing rheology; provides good adhesion of the dried print to
the substrate before firing and gives enough strength to the
unfired composite so it will not crack or chip during handling
prior to firing.Today's thick film industry needs to conform to
government regulations and develop systems eliminating the use
of chlorinated organic solvents. Circuit makers have also
required faster printing speeds to produce circuits at lower cost
and in higher volumes. New electronic circuits are being
designed with finer features so more functionality can be placed
in smaller spaces and/or higher circuit transmission speeds can
be attained. To manufacture these new circuits using thick film
technology, dielectric pastes have to
