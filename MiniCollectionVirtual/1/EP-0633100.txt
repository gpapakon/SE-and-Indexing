<ABSTRACT>
This torque wrench (6) includes a head (2) for tightening a member to be screwed-in, an operating grip (3), a handle (7) which is deformable and sensitive to bending connecting the grip to the tightening head, and electronic means (M) for measuring the deformation of the handle and displaying the tightening torque which is calculated from the said deformation measurement; the handle includes a region whose main cross-section is different from that of the rest of the handle by virtue of a cutout (9) and such that it can locallly convert shear stresses, generated by the operating force (F), into extension/compression stresses parallel to the surface of the handle. This arrangement makes it possible to compensate for the error introduced by only taking account of bending when calculating the torque transmitted by the tightening head and therefore makes it possible to avoid exceeding the maximum tightening torque beyond which the profile of the tightening head or the screw thread of the member being screwed-in might be damaged, and all this is achieved by means of a relatively inexpensive system.

Tool for measuring torque, for example tightening torque, 
such as an electronic torque wrench (6), comprising a head (2) 

for tightening a member to be screwed, a manual control hand-grip 
(3), a handle (7; 11) which is deformable and sensitive to 

bending, connecting the hand-grip to the head, as well as 
electronic means (M) for measuring the deformation of the handle 

and displaying the torque determined from said deformation 
measurement, characterised in that said means (M) are adapted to 

measure, independently or otherwise, the stresses due 
respectively to shearing and to bending, and these means are 

produced in order that these stresses are in proportions such 
that the influence of the shearing stresses compensates for an 

error caused by taking the bending alone into consideration for 
the determination of the torque transmitted by the head. 
Tool according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
handle comprises an area whereof the main section is different 

from that of the remainder of the handle and such that it is able 
to transform locally shearing stresses, generated by the control 

force (F), into elongation/compression stresses parallel to the 
surface of the handle. 
Tool according to Claim 2, characterised in that the area 
of main section different from that of the remainder of the 

handle (7) comprises at least one transverse recess (8; 9), of 
preferably regular section whereof the axis (XX) is perpendicular 

to the axis of the handle (4) and to the control force (F) or 
reaction force. 
Tool according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
section of the recess is uniform, for example square (8), 

circular (9) or rectangular. 
Tool according to Claim 4, in which the recess (9) is 
cylindrical, characterised in that the axis of this recess is  

 
situated in the main p
lane of the deformable handle, defined by 
the longitudinal axis of the wrench and by the axis of the part 

to be screwed, in order to produce two identical deformation 
areas on either side of the recess. 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the handle (7; 11; 15) and the recess (8, 9...) have a shape 

such that the proportion between the stresses due to bending and 
those due to shearing is constant or approximately constant over 

a predetermined length of the part receiving the measuring member 
(M), and in that this measuring member comprises a sensitive part 

which preferably has constant sensitivity over the measuring 
length. 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that at least one of the members (M) sensitive to stresses of the 

measuring means is constituted by at least two parts, certain of 
which are placed in areas where the proportion of stresses is 

slightly higher than the theoretical value, whereas the other 
parts are placed in areas where the proportion of stresses is 

slightly lower than the theoretical value. 
Tool according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
different parts of the aforesaid sensitive member or members 

comprise due to construction, or are associated with means making 
it possible to adjust their reciprocal influence discretely or 

continuously in order to obtain overall a proportion 
corresponding exactly to the desired value. 
Tool according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
different parts of the sensitive members in question comprise by 

construction or are associated with means making it possible to 
adjust their overall influence discretely or continuously in 

order to obtain an overall sensitivity corresponding exactly to 
the desired value, said means being able to be combined with or 

separate from the aforesaid means intended for adjusting the 
proportion.  

 
Tool according to one of Claims 2 to 8, characterised in 
that the recess has a geometry such that it may be adjusted 

mechanically after fixing the sensitive members of the measuring 
means (M) in order to obtain the adequate value of the proportion 

of sensitivity to stresses, and the mechanical adjusting means 
provided are arranged in order to be able to be used without risk 

of damaging said sensitive members. 
Tool according to one of Claims 6 to 8, characterised in 
that said adjustment means comprise or are associated with 

specific auxiliary means for adjusting the proportion of 
sensitivity to stresses as a function of a change in geometry of 

the member for controlling the part to be screwed, if the latter 
is removable, and/or changing an adaptor between this control 

member and the part to be screwed. 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised 
in that it comprises means making it possible to modify the 

functional geometry of the recess in the control member, directly 
or indirectly causing a modification of its influence, in order 

to adjust the proportion of sensitivity to stresses, as a 
function of a change of geometry of the member for controlling 

the part to be screwed, if the latter is removable, and/or as a 
function of a change of the adaptor between this control member 

and the part to be screwed. 
Tool according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
area of different section is constituted by at least two parallel 

small bars (12) whereof the opposite ends (14) have a section 
greater than that of the intermediate part (12) of constant 

section of the small bar and supports the means (M) for measuring 
the tightening torque. 
Tool according to Claim 12, characterised in that said 
ends (14) of the small bars (12) have a conical profile. 
Tool according to Claim 1, characterised in that said  
 

area (16) of different section is constituted by a central part 
(17) of section greater than that of the remainder of the handle, 

and by two opposed terminal parts (18), whereof the section 
decreases as far as the connection to the contiguous parts (15a) 

of the handle (15), one of these terminal parts being provided 
with means (M) for measuring the tightening torque. 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 15, characterised 
in that the means (M) for measuring the tightening torque

Tool according to Claim 1, characterised in that the

member (20) for measuring the bending forces due to the control 
force (Figure 8). 
Tool according to Claim 1, characterised in that said
