<ABSTRACT>
Threshold optimization for SOI transistors is achieved 
through the formation of a layer of charge (21) within the 

gate oxide (14), which layer has a polarity corresponding to 
that of the ion implantation (22) for threshold voltage 

control. A negative charge layer (21) is formed by 
furnishing trace amounts of aluminum on the substrate 

before growth of an oxide to form a portion of the gate 
oxide. The aluminum will form a charge layer (21) on the 

surface of the oxide (19) and an additional oxide (18) is then 
deposited on the same to form the gate oxide as a 

sandwich with the charge layer in the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuitry
and, more particularly, to arrangements for threshold
voltage control in integrated circuit devices.Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology has been
developed for forming transistors and other electrical
devices in integrated circuitry. An SOI differs from
more common bulk semiconductors in that the active
region (the region in which the semiconductor electrical
devices are formed) is a semiconductor layer separated
from a semiconductor base by a dielectric region. If
the semiconductor is silicon as is common, the
dielectric typically is silicon dioxide. The active
region of the SOI then becomes the layer of silicon
which exists between the dielectric (or, in other words,
the insulator) and the surface.Use of SOI technology has the advantage of simplifying
isolation of various electrical devices. Moreover, SOI
transistors have low parasitic capacitance, low leakage
currents, soft error immunity, etc. However, to obtain
the full advantage of SOI, it is desirable that if the 
device is a transistor, it be fully depleting, i.e.,
that surface depletion extend through the active region
to the dielectric region. Full depletion has many
advantages, including providing higher mobility for the
passage of charge, and it provides integrated circuitry
having continuous current/voltage characteristics.One problem with reducing the thickness of the active
region in line with integrating semiconductor devices,
is that the doping concentration necessary for threshold
control of transistors formed on the active region may
prevent full depletion. In this connection, the factor
that governs the extent to which the surface depletion
level extends into the active region is the
concentration of dopants in such region. The high
concentration which has been believed to be necessary to
provide a desired threshold voltage prevents full
depletion when the transistor gate oxide is thin. For
example, if the oxide has a thickness of 50 Å units (10Å = 1nm) and
it is desired that the threshold voltage be maintained
at .5 V, the doping concentration for such threshold
voltage is about 3 x 1017/cm3. With this thickness, a
fully depleted device requires for the transistor to be
fully depleting an active region thickness of the order
of 500 Å. Such a thickness might not be compatible with
the optimization of devices as the function of the 
devices would have a thickness of 500 Å and their
resistance will be high. If thick active regions are
used, many of the advantages of
