<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous dispersed resin 
composition ready to undergo crosslinking at room temperature 
to provide a film excellent in water resistance, resistance to 
whitening on contact with water, antiblocking properties, heat 
resistance, solvent resistance, adhesion, and hardness. The 
composition of the present invention has satisfactory 
workability because the drying properties are controllable and 
is easy to handle because it does not undergo gelation. It is 
useful as clear varnish for external application, a binder for 
stone finishing compounds, a top coat for such a stone finish, 
coating compounds such as OP varnish, printing inks, and 
textile assistants. Having excellent water-resistant adhesion, 
a moderate open time, and a long pot life, the composition is 
most suitable as an adhesive. An aqueous dispersed resin composition comprising a 
carbonyl-containing copolymer resin aqueous dispersion and a 
hydrazine derivative containing at least two hydrazino groups 
in the molecule thereof is known (see, e.g., JP-A-57-3850, JP-A-64-48801 
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application"), U.S. Patents 
4,267,091, 4,210,565, 5,208,282 and 4,959,428 and JP-B-1-13501 
(the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined published  
 
Japanese patent application"). This composition easily 
undergoes crosslinking at room temperature to provide a film 
having various excellent physical properties. However, it 
rapidly dries after application, tending to suffer from 
unevenness of coating or cracks due to shrinkage stress. In order to overcome these disadvantages, use of a 
large quantity of an emulsifying agent or addition of a wetting 
agent or a water-soluble resin has been attempted, but either 
attempt results in reduction in water resistance of a film to 
an impractical level. In order to improve water resistance, external addition 
of an epoxy-containing compound or use of an epoxy-containing 
monomer as one of monomers constituting an aqueous resin 
dispersion has been proposed. The aqueous resin dispersions of 
this type exhibit improved water resistance but are apt to 
undergo gelation on account of the epoxy group. Therefore, the 
composition must be supplied as a two-pack type of formulation, 
which is troublesome to handle. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
aqueous dispersed resin composition which easily undergoes 
crosslinking at room temperature to provide a film excellent in 
water resistance, resistance
