Auxiliary power steering mechanism, particularly for motor 
vehicles, with a control valve (1) in the form of a rotary 

slide valve for the control of a pressure medium supplied by a 
servo-pump (3) from a container (4) to and from the working 

chambers of a servo-motor (2), 

wherein the control valve has two reaction chambers (10, 
11) which are connected to a pressure line (15) of the 

servo-pump (3) by means of a fixed throttle point (12, 
13) in each case and by means of a common throttle point 

(14; 30; 31) and 
wherein the reaction pressure acting in the reaction 
chambers (10, 11) can be limited to a maximum value by 

means of at least one cut-off valve (18), 
 
characterized 


in that the cut-off valve (18) is in the form of a 
pressure balance, the response pressure of which can be 

adjusted from outside without dismantling and 
that the cut-off valve (18) is placed in the pressure 
line (15) of the servo-pump (3) between the servo-pump 

(3) and the reaction chambers (10, 11). 
Auxiliary power steering mechanism according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that in a valve bore (21) the cut-off valve 

(18) has a two-part valve body (20), the internal part (20A) 
of which is guided in the valve bore (21) so that it cannot 

rotate and can be displaced axially and the external part 
(20B) so that it can rotate and cannot be displaced axially, 


that the internal part (20A) is connected to the external 
part (20B) of the valve body (20) by means of a thread 

(24), 
that the external part (20B) can be rotated by means of 
an adjustment device (28) accessible from the outside, 
that a control piston (26) acted upon by a compression 
spring (25) is arranged in the inside of the valve body 

(20) and  
 
that the force of the compression spring (25) can be 
adjusted by means of the rotating of the external 

part (20B). 
Auxiliary power steering mechanism according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the common throttle point (14) has a 

throughflow cross-section that can be changed as a function of 
the vehicle's speed. 
Auxiliary power steering mechanism according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the common throttle point (30; 31) has 

a constant throughflow cross-section. 
Auxiliary power steering mechanism according to Claims 2 
and 4, characterized in that the common throttle point (30) is 

arranged in the valve body (20). 
Auxiliary power steering mechanism according to Claims 2 
and 4, characterized in that the common throttle point (31) is 

arranged in the control piston (26).
