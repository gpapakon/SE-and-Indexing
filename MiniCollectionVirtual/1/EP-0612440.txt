Insulation piercing connecting device (18) made 
of flat material, having at least two clamping legs 

(2, 11, 12) between which a clamping slot (3) which 
extends essentially in the longitudinal direction of the 

insulation piercing connecting device is formed by a 
shearing cut, into which slot an insulated connecting 

wire (6) can be pushed so as to produce a contact, the 
clamping slot having in the region of its free end a 

constriction, characterized in that the clamping slot (3) 
has in the vicinity of its free end an obliquely extending 

section which at one clamping leg (2, 11, 12) 
produces a shoulder which points towards the free end and 

which at the other clamping leg produces a shoulder which 
points in the opposite direction and is displaced longitudinally 

in relation to the other shoulder towards the 
free end, and in that the connecting wire (6) can be 

pushed into the obliquely extending section. 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that the clamping slot (3) 

has in the vicinity of its free end an obtusely angled 
jagged shape which produces on one of the clamping legs 

(2, 12) a jagged projection (4) and on the other clamping 
leg (2, 11) a corresponding jagged depression (5), in 

that the projection (4) and the depression (5) are offset 
with respect to one another in the longitudinal direction, 

and in that the connecting wire (6) can be pushed 
into the clamping slot (3) as far as under the tip of the 

projection (4). 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 2, characterized in that the height of the  

 
projection (4) is less than the thickness of the insulation 

piercing connecting device (1). 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the depression (5) 

is at a greater distance from the free slot end than the 
projection (4). 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

two ends of the legs are offset from one another by 
shortening and/or plugging [sic]
. 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 5, characterized in that the shorter clamping 

leg (2) has a bead-like bent-out portion (7). 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 5, characterized in that the longer clamping leg 

(2) has an impression (6) which reduces its thickness. 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 5, characterized in that the shorter leg has at 

the end (13) of its foot a short double bend in the 
manner of a right-angled bend and is bent out of the 

plane of the material by approximately the thickness of 
the material. 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to one of the preceding claims, which is inserted and 

guided in a receptacle chamber (9) of an insulating 
element (10) in such a way that when the connecting wire 

(6) is pressed in, the clamping legs (12) can only be 
deflected in the plane of the material. 
Insulation piercing connecting device according 
to Claim 9, characterized in that the insulation piercing 

connecting device (8) has three clamping legs (11, 12) 
and two clamping slots (3) for one connecting wire (6) 

each, in that a central clamping leg (11) has the double 
be
nd or bead-like bent-out portion at the end (13) of its 
foot and that the outer clamping legs (12) remain in the 

main plane of the material of the insulation piercing 
connecting device.
