<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to neutral and low overbased
alkylphenoxy sulfonate additive compositions which, at equivalent
amounts of diluent oil, have lower viscosities as compared to
comparable products known in the art.During operation, the lubricating oil employed in automobile
engines accumulates sludge and other harmful deposit forming
materials which, if left untreated, would greatly reduce the
operating life of the engine. Typically, however, dispersant and
detergent additives are added to the lubricating oil to disperse the
deposit forming material so as to retard or remove deposit
formations. Such additives include, by way of example, alkenyl
succinimides, overbased phenates, including overbased sulfurized
phenates, neutral and overbased sulfonates, including neutral and
low overbased alkylphenoxy sulfonates, and the like. These
additives are typically employed in a variety of combinations so
that the lubricating oil formulation contains more than one
dispersant or detergent to control and/or remove deposit
formation. Of particular interest are neutral and low overbased
alkylphenoxy sulfonate additive compositions which are useful in
providing detergency and dispersancy properties to lubricating oil
compositions. Specifically, it is known that neutral and low
overbased alkylphenoxy sulfonates provide for improved control
of piston deposits during diesel engine operation as compared to
highly overbased alkylphenoxy sulfonates. In addition, low
overbased alkylphenoxy sulfonates provide a measure of alkalinity
reserve, albeit small, which is useful in neutralizing acids
generated during engine operation especially when engines are
operating on sulfur containing fuels.The formation of neutral and low overbased alkylphenoxy
sulfonate additive compositions by alkylation of phenol,
sulfonation of the alkylated phenolic compounds and subsequent
neutralization of the alkylphenol sulfonic acid by at least a
stoichiometric equivalent of an alkaline earth metal base are, in a
very general sense, known in the art.For example, British Patent Specification No. 1 332 473
discloses the preparation of neutral alkylphenoxy sulfonate
additive compositions and further discloses conversion of these
materials to overbased alkylphenoxy sulfonate additive
compositions (i.e., having a TBN of about 200 or more).Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,751,010 discloses the
preparation of neutral and overbased alkylphenoxy sulfonate
additive compositions useful as detergent-dispersant additives in
lubricating oils. The disclosed
