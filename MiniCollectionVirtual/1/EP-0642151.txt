<ABSTRACT>
A night vision scope (10) incorporates an infrared 
light source (16) having a control circuit (S2, R1-R4) 

coupled between a voltage supply circuit and an infrared 
source, the control circuit comprising a resistive 

voltage divider arrangement (R2-R4) with a multi-position 
switch to give alternative illuminations of the infrared 

source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to night vision scopes. Night vision scopes are used generally by military 
and law enforcement personnel for operations in low 
light conditions. This enables military and law 
enforcement personnel to use the night vision scopes to 
observe conditions at night and in dark buildings. A 
night vision scope allows the user to continue to make 
tactical advances and observe hostile tactical 
advances. New night vision scopes are also designed to 
assist pilots of helicopters and planes to more easily 
fly at night. Early night vision scopes allowed the user to 
observe light in the infrared spectrum. To do so, 
sufficient infrared light, invisible to the human eye, 
had to be supplied by beacons to illuminate an area. 
These scopes were used for only a limited period of 
time because of the concern that hostile forces could 
use similar night vision scopes to locate the infrared 
beacon and its user. Currently, night vision scopes utilize image 
intensification technologies. That is, the night 
vision scope receives ambient light from the 
environment and intensifies the image to produce an 
output image which is visible to the human eye. The 
present generation of night vision scopes operate to 
intensify low levels of visible light and make visible 
the light from the infrared spectrum. The image intensification process involves 
conversion of the received ambient light into electron 
patterns, intensification and energization of the 
electron patterns, and conversion of the electron 
patterns into light visible to the observer. Use by law enforcement officials and army 
personnel during active engagement with hostile forces 
requires that the night vision scopes be rugged and  
 
light weight. Further, it is important that the 
voltage supply for the night vision scope be 
dependable, light weight, and easily renewed. In 
constructing a rugged night vision scope it is 
important for the scope to be impervious to shocks and 
environmental conditions, such as moisture. 
Accordingly, the voltage supply must also be impervious 
to environmental conditions. Night vision scopes require batteries to supply 
the power. Either a single specialized battery or two 
conventional batteries can be used. Typical night 
vision scopes use two batteries. Since night vision scopes are designed to be light 
weight, using one battery is preferable to using two 
batteries. Any battery used in a night vision scope should be 
easily replaceable but sealed against water leakage 
into the battery area.
