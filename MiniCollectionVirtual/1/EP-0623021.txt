<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 4"-deoxyerythromycin derivatives of
erythromycins A and B and pharmaceutical compositions containing these
compounds, as well as the use thereof in treating gastrointestinal disorders and in
facilitating the placement of diagnostic and therapeutic instrumentation into the
proximal small intestine. The invention also relates to synthetic intermediates
employed therein.The primary function of the alimentary or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is to provide
the body with a balanced supply of water, electrolytes and nutrients. In order for
this to be achieved, food must be moved along the GI tract at an appropriate rate for
digestion, absorption and secretion to take place. Food is normally transported
through the GI tract in a well-coordinated manner by propulsive movements which
are mediated by clusters of smooth muscle contractions known as migrating
myoelectric complexes, in a process commonly referred to as peristalsis.Defects in the normal motility pattem can lead to the development of chronic,
painful and debilitating disorders. For example, an incompetent or weak lower
esophageal sphincter may result in frequent reflux of ingested food from the
stomach into the esophagus which may lead to esophagitis. Prokinetic agents
(also called motility-enhancing agents) are useful in treating reflux esophagitis
because they (a) increase the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter, thereby
inhibiting reflux; (b) increase the force of esophageal peristalsis to facilitate
clearance of food from the esophagus into the stomach; and (c) increase gastric
emptying, thereby further decreasing the mass available for reflux.There is a need, however, for improved prokinetic agents in the treatment of
this disorder. Presently used cholinergic drugs such as bethanechol and
dopamine receptor blocking agents such as metoclopramide may exhibit serious
disadvantages. Bethanechol, for example, should be avoided by elderly patients
while metoclopramide has a narrow therapeutic index, pronounced central nervous
system (CNS) side effects and is known to stimulate prolactin release.Patients suffering from other GI motility-related disorders such as delayed
gastric emptying, diabetic gastroparesis, anorexia, gall bladder stasis, surgically 
induced adynamic ileus and chronic constipation (colonic inertia) may also benefit
from treatment with prokinetic agents. In addition, prokinetic agents can aid in the
placement of diagnostic and therapeutic instrumentation, such as during the
insertion of enteral
