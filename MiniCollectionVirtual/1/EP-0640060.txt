<ABSTRACT>
An induction-heated furnace, suitable for heat treatment of synthetic silica bodies, under conditions of high purity, includes a tubular susceptor (1) disposed with its axis vertical and an induction coil (3) for raising the temperature of the susceptor. The susceptor is made from graphite and/or silicon carbide, and is enclosed within a vacuum envelope (2) made from vitreous silica or fused quartz, the envelope being surrounded by the induction coil which is liquid-cooled. The design is such that the vacuum envelope (2) operates at temperatures below those at which either devitrification or sagging of the envelope might occur even when the tubular susceptor (1) is heated to a temperature of 1700  DEG C. Thus sintering of a porous synthetic silica body (9) can be carried out under atmospheric or reduced pressure, the furnace including a shaft (7) adapted to support the body to be heated and capable of rotation about and movement along said vertical axis of the tubular susceptor (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved heat treatment 
furnace and facility for the manufacture of large synthetic 
vitreous silica bodies. The manufacture of high purity vitreous silica bodies 
is of growing commercial importance due, in particular, to 
the needs of the optical fibre and semiconductor 
industries. Initially the requirements of these industries 
could be met with fused quartz glasses, made by melting 
highly refined quartz crystal powders by using electrical 
or flame fusion techniques. As purity requirements have 
advanced, however, it has been increasingly difficult, 
using naturally occurring crystal feedstocks, to achieve the 
purities sought and attention has turned to alternative 
synthetic sources of vitreous silica. Much work has been 
published concerning such alternative routes, the most 
important of which have been vapour deposition and sol-gel 
or related techniques. For example, large bodies of porous synthetic vitreous 
silica can now be made by deposition of silica soot from a 
flame, in which silicon tetrachloride or an alternative 
volatile silicon-containing compound is hydrolysed or 
oxidised in a hydrogen-oxygen, or methane-oxygen flame. 
The flux of silica micro-particles is typically directed at 
a rotating cylindrical substrate, where it deposits as a 
porous body of pure vitreous silica, frequently known as a 
silica soot body. This soot body is subsequently converted 
to glass by a process of sintering, (also referred to as 
consolidation or vitrification). By adding appropriate 
dopant reagents to the flame, the soot body may be doped 
with either metallic or non-metallic species. Thus  
 
germanium, phosphorus etc., may be added as dopants to 
raise the refractive index of the product glass, and 
fluorine or boron may be added to reduce refractive index. Such porous vitreous silica bodies may be alternatively 
made by casting shapes made using slurries of ultra-fine 
synthetic vitreous silica powders (e.g. P. K. Bachmann et 
al, Shape Forming of Synthetic Silica Tubes by Layerwise 
Centrifugal Particle Deposition, Ceramic Bulletin, 68(10), 
1989), or by dry-pressing such powders (e.g. US Patent 
4,620,862), or even by casting, from precipitated silica 
sols, though this last method presents problems for making 
large bodies. In this specification it should be understood that 
where reference is made to a soot body, should the context 
allow, a body of porous synthetic silica derived from any 
alternative process is alternatively possible. The above methods

An induction-heated furnace, suitable for heat 
treatment and/or sintering of synthetic silica bodies, under 

conditions of high purity, comprising a tubular susceptor 
disposed with its axis vertical and a liquid-cooled 

induction coil for raising the temperature of the susceptor, 
the susceptor being made from graphite and/or silicon 

carbide, and being enclosed within a vacuum envelope made 
from vitreous silica or fused quartz, and the envelope being 

surrounded by the liquid-cooled induction coil, wherein the 
design is such that the vacuum envelope operates at 

temperatures below those at which either devitrification or 
sagging of the envelope might occur even when the tubular 

susceptor is heated to a temperature of 1700Â°C, whereby heat 
treatment and/or sintering of a porous synthetic silica body

a shaft capable of rotation about and movement along said 

vertical axis of the tubular susceptor, said shaft being 
adapted to support the body to be heated. 
A furnace according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the induction coil is substantially shorter than the tubular 

susceptor, and in which the induction coil is mounted to be 
moved over the envelope to provide a hot zone movable

body contained therein. 
A furnace according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the vacuum envelope is terminated below by a closure 

means and is supported from above by a carriage or the like

furnace chamber in which zone sintering may be undertaken 
again under a controlled gas environment and under 

controlled conditions of temperature and pressure.
