<ABSTRACT>
Using this device, the sensitivity in receivers, the gain control criterion of which is a constant noise signal, can be controlled independently of received information signals so that the reception of information flows lasting a long time is possible. For this purpose, a diode (D1) is provided which is connected with its anode to a voltage source and is connected with its cathode, on the one hand, to a current source (Q4) and, on the other hand, to the cathode of another diode (D2), the anode of which is connected to the capacitor (C12). A first voltage which is lower in the no-signal state than a second voltage supplied via the one diode (D1) is present across the capacitor (C12) so that the further diode (D2) is blocked. After an information signal has been received, a discharge pulse (EP), by means of which the second voltage is lowered to a value which is lower than the first voltage, is generated in dependence on an output signal of a signal detector. In this process, the capacitor (C12) is discharged to such an extent that the amount of charge lost corresponds to the charge applied to the capacitor (C12) when an information signal is received.
