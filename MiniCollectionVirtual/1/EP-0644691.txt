<ABSTRACT>
The video signal input is converted to high-speed 
reproduction data by a high-speed reproduction data encoder 

1. The video signal input is converted to high-speed 
reproduction data by a formatter 2, which formats the high-speed 

reproduction data so that the same data is recorded 
to n tracks; this becomes the recorded data. After the 

recorded data is input to an error correction encoder 3, it 
is decoded by a decoder 4 and recorded by a recording head 

5 to the magnetic tape 6. During reproduction, the 
recorded data is reproduced by reproduction head 7 from the 

magnetic tape 6, and decoded by decoder 8. The decoded 
data is then error corrected by an error correction decoder 

9, and then input to a deformatter 10. The deformatter 10 
separates the normal reproduction data from the high-speed 

reproduction data, and separately outputs both data types. 
During normal reproduction, the normal reproduction data is 

output by a switch 13; the high-speed reproduction data is 
decoded to video data by a high-speed reproduction data 

decoder during high speed reproduction, and output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and
reproducing apparatus, and particularly to a digital video
cassette recorder (VCR).Most VCRs available today use analog recording,
but the image deterioration resulting during recording,
reproducing, and particularly dubbing with analog VCRs has
heightened interest in digital recording VCRs.An example of a common consumer digital VCR is
described in the ICCE Digest of Technical Papers, June
1989, 6 - 9.VCRs today use helical recording, a
recording/reproducing method whereby heads are mounted on a
cylinder positioned at an angle to the perpendicular and
rotating at high speed, and the magnetic tape is
transported while wrapped by a loading post to the
cylinder.Tracks are recorded in this helical recording
method by the movement of the magnetic tape and the
rotation of the heads. The recorded television signal is often
compressed to reduce the amount of data recorded. Intra-frame
compression is generally used for the video signal
due in order to enable image editing, but inter-frame
compression methods, which obtain the difference between
the current intra-frame compressed image and the images
before and after, have been recently established (e.g.,
MPEG compression).The conventional recording method described
above, however, cannot be easily applied to recording and
reproducing inter-frame compressed video signals. For
example, significant image degradation occurs when errors
occur during reproduction. More specifically, in coding
methods using inter-frame compression, if the current image
(frame) (the image referenced to obtain the difference from
the before and after images) is disrupted, the
deterioration in image quality will extend across several
following frames; if the intra-frame compressed area is
disrupted due to a signal error, the frames interpolated
based on that image area will be severely disrupted.Gaps may also appear in the data when an error
occurs during reproduction and during high-speed
reproduction, and data duplication may occur during slow
reproduction modes and when reproducing tapes to which the
data is recorded plural times. The data compression decoder is able to decode
and reproduce the signal during normal reproduction modes,
but is unable to function normally during high-speed
reproduction and when data is lost or duplicated due to an
error, and in the worst case scenario may not be able to
decode the video signal.EP 0 553 949 A2 discloses an apparatus for decoding digital data representative of a
compressed digital image
