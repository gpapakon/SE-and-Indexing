<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods
wherein, by recording the intensity of one or more
magnetic resonance signals obtained in vivo and
comparison with the signal intensity of a standard,
the concentration of an NMR-detectable xenobiotic
compound may be determined in a living subject. In
preferred embodiments, the present invention
provides a method for evaluating, in vivo, the
clearance rate of a xenobiotic compound from a
living subject, thereby providing a noninvasive
method for determining the status of the excretory
organs of the subject, and a method for determining
the proper dosing regimen of a pharmacologically
active compound to be administered to the subject.The spinning of the nuclei of certain atoms
such as 1H, 13C, 15N, 19F, 23Na, and 31P generates
a magnetic moment along the axis of spin. When
placed in an external magnetic field, alignment
with, or against, the magnetic field may result.
Since alignment with the magnetic field is more
stable, energy must be absorbed to excite the 
nucleus to the less stable alignment against the
field. The frequency of the radiation energy
required to excite a given nucleus is proportional
to the strength of the external magnetic field; the
stronger the magnetic field, the higher the
frequency of the radiation required. When such
nuclei return to their lower energy state, absorbed
radiation is emitted, and a signal may be detected.
Various analytical techniques utilize these
magnetic resonance principles.For example, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy has been employed to analyze the
structure of chemical compounds. Generally, in
this technique, the radiation frequency is kept
constant, and the magnetic field strength varied.
At some value of applied magnetic field strength,
which value is characterstic of the type of nucleus
and the environment in which it is found, the
energy required to excite the nucleus matches the
energy of the radiation, absorption occurs, and a
signal may be observed. The number, positions and
intensities of the signals obtained while varying
the magnetic field strength are recorded as a
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum which provides
detailed information on molecular structure. It
has been reported by Shulman et al. that NMR
spectroscopy has been employed in certain cases
both in vitro and in vivo. (Shulman et al.,
"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in
Diagnostic and Investigative Medicine", J. Clin.
Invest., Vol. 74, 1127-1131 (1984)). NMR
spectroscopy, however, while capable of providing
