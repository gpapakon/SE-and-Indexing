<ABSTRACT>
A water treatment apparatus has a tank that contains a resin bed through which water flows. The apparatus has a controller that occasionally measures the conductivity of the resin bed at two spaced apart locations to produce first and second conductivity measurements. The ratio of the two conductivity measurements then is calculated. The present ratio value, along with the minimum and maximum ratio values that occurred since a previous regeneration of the resin bed, are used to determine the movement of an exhaustion front through the resin bed. A probability of exhaustion also is determined and when that probability exceeds a given value, regeneration of the resin bed is initiated. The conductivity measurements are used to determine if the resin bed has lost efficiency and in which event a warning signal is sent to the user. During regeneration, the conductivity at one of the locations in the resin bed is monitored to detect whether a regenerant has entered the tank; if not another warning signal is sent to the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for softening water; and
particularly to systems for controlling the regeneration of the resin of the water
softener.It is not uncommon for water that is drawn from a well to be considered
"hard" in that it contains di-positive and sometimes tri-positive ions which
have leached from mineral deposits in the earth. Such ions form insoluble
salts with common detergents and soaps producing precipitates that require an
increased quantity of detergent or soap for cleaning purposes. When hard water
is used in boilers evaporation results in the precipitation of the insoluble
residues which tend to accumulate as scale.It is common practice to install a water softener in the plumbing system
of a building that a supplied with hard water. The most common type of water
softener is an ion exchange resin-type softener having a tank which holds a bed
of resin through which the hard water is passed to remove undesirable
minerals and other impurities. Initially binding sites in the resin bed contain
positive ions, commonly unipositive sodium or potassium ions. As hard water
enters the resin, competition for the binding sites occurs. The di-positive and
tri-positive ions in the hard water are favored due to their higher charge
densities and displace the unipositive ions. Two or three unipositive ions are
displaced for each di-positive or tri-positive ion, respectively.The capacity of the resin bed to absorb minerals and impurities is finite
and eventually ceases to soften the water when a large percentage of the sites
are occupied by the di-positive and tri-positive ions. When this occurs, it
becomes necessary to recharge or regenerate the resin bed by flushing it with a
regenerant, typically a solution of sodium chloride or potassium chloride. The 
concentration of unipositive ions in the regenerant is sufficiently high to offset
the unfavorable electrostatic competition and the binding sites are recovered by
unipositive ions. The interval of time between regeneration periods during
which water softening takes place is referred to as a "service cycle."Regeneration of early types of water softeners was affected manually
only after it was discovered that the treatment capacity of the resin bed has
been exceeded and the water flowing therethrough is no longer soft. In an
effort to eliminate the need for manual regeneration, water softener control
systems were developed utilizing a mechanical clock which initiated water
softener regeneration on a periodic basis. The frequency of
