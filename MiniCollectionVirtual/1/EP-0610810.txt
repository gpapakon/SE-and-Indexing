<ABSTRACT>
A laser mirror device (10) is described having a deformable mirror element (14) and a pot-like housing (12), which is provided for holding the mirror element (14). The housing (12) has an ante-chamber (22) with a heat-transferring fluid for the dissipated heat in the mirror element (14). For this purpose, a cooling chamber (24) is provided in the housing (12), which cooling chamber is spatially separated from the ante-chamber (22) by a partition (separating element) (18) of heat-conducting material and through which a cooling medium flows. The pressure in the cooling chamber (24) has thus no effect on the instantaneously set doming of the mirror surface (38) which is caused by the current fluid pressure in the ante-chamber (22) or by a linear actuator (52) which projects through the two chambers (24, 22) and the partition (18).

Reflecting device (10) having a reflecting element (14) 
and a cooling device provided for carrying off surplus 

thermal energy from the reflecting device (10), the 
cooling device having a cooling chamber (24) through 

which a cooling medium flows and which is spatially 
separated by means of a dimensionally stable separating 

element (18) made of a good heat-conducting material from 
an antechamber (22) directly behind a reflecting base 

plate (34),
 
characterized in that
 
it is a matter of the reflecting base plate (34) of a 

deformable reflecting element (14), which is fixed in a 
housing (12), which has the cooling chamber (24), the 

antechamber (22) also being filled with a good heat-conducting 
fluid. 
Reflecting device according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the separating element (18) in the housing (12) has a 

section, roughly parallel to the reflecting element (14) 
and located close behind the reflecting element (14), 

which divides the housing (12) into the small-volume 
antechamber (22) and the cooling chamber (24). 
Reflecting device according to Claim 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the separating element (18) has a dimensionally stable and 

large-surface heat-transferring cross-sectional geometry. 
Reflecting device according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the housing (12) is designed as a type of pot having a 

base (26) and a side-wall (28) standing away from the base 
(26), the reflecting element (14) closing off the pot-like 

housing (12) on the side away from the base (26) and the 
separating element (18) being fixed to the side wall (28).  

 
Reflecting device according to Claim 4,
 
characterized in that
 
the side wall (28) is formed with a shoulder (30) running 

round it for fixing the separating element (18). 
Reflecting device according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the housing (12) has at least one connection (50) opening 

into the antechamber (22) for a pressure fluid as heat-conducting 
fluid and at least two connections (32) opening 

into the cooling chamber (24) for the cooling medium. 
Reflecting device according to Claim 6,
 
characterized in that
 
at least one connection (50) for the pressure fluid is 

provided in the housing (12). 
Reflecting device according to Claim 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the connections (32) for the cooling medium are provided 

in the base (26) of the housing (12). 
Reflecting device according to one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the reflecting element (14) is designed in the shape of a 

pot having a deformable reflecting base plate (34) and a 
collar (36) standing away from the rear side of the 

circumferential rim of the reflecting base plate (34) and 
is fixed to the housing (12) by means of a fixing 

component (16).

claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the housing (12) is crossed parallel to its axis by at 

least one linear actuator (52), which passes through the 
separating element (18) and is supported behind the 

reflecting base plate (34).
