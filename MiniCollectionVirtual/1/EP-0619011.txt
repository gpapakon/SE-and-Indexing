<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sensor for determining 
speed/torque of a rotatable member, comprising a 
magneto-optic material, a magnetic field source, and optic 
fiber means connectable to a source of light for providing 
an optical path for input light between said light source 
and said magneto-optic material and for output light 
exiting said magneto-optic material, said material being 
positionable within said magnetic field and said magnetic 
positionable within said magnetic field and said magnetic 
field being modulated by rotation of the member so that 
said magnetic field modulation corresponds to speed/torque 
of the rotatable member. The invention also relates to a method for determining the 
speed/torque of a rotatable member, comprising the steps 
of providing a magnetic field, positioning a magneto-optic 
material within a portion of the magnetic field so that 
the material responds to changes in the magnetic field, 
and modulating said magnetic field portion in relation to 
speed/torque of the rotatable member. One such sensor and method are known from Patent Abstracts 
of Japan, vol, 1, No. 102 (P-448), 18th April 1986, and 
from JP-A-6 0 235 065. In this known sensor and method, 
however, the operation is dependent on the use of  
 
polarisers. Accordingly, the magneto-optic material is positioned in 
the light path between input and output polarisers (or 
between an input polariser and an output analyser which is 
effectively a polariser). The need for polarisers 
introduces complication and expense - in particular, 
because polarisers use expensive material and may be 
adversely affected by harsh environments such as high 
temperatures within a turbine engine for example. The 
invention aims to overcome these problems. According to one aspect of the invention, therefore, the 
known sensor is characterised in that said magneto-optic 
material has domains responsive to said modulated magnetic 
field and diffracting said light, said output light having 
a diffraction pattern with an energy distribution that 
changes in response to said modulated magnetic field, said 
optic fiber means receiving a predetermined portion of 
said output light without a polarizer. According to another aspect of the invention, the known 
method is characterized by the steps of directing light 
into the material and using the modulated magnetic field 
to change domains of the material resulting in a 
diffraction pattern for the light that has an energy 
distribution that changes in correspondence with the 
modul
