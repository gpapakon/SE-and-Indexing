<CLAIMS>
A plastic molding composition for production of
moldings having a decorative effect, comprising


a) 100 to 50% by weight of isotactic polypropylene
or a copolymer of propylene with up to 17% by

weight of ethylene,
b) 0 to 50% by weight of a rubber-like copolymer
compatible with polypropylene,
c) 0 to 50% by weight of reinforcing substance
and/or filler and
d) 0.5 to 15% by weight, based on a) + b) + c), of
dark olive-colored or dark gray to black

basalt fibers having a fiber length of 0.2 to
6 mm and a thickness of 10 to 20 Âµm and

wherein the basalt fibers are provided with a
coating agent.
A molding composition as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the reinforcing substances and/or fillers

are talc, barium sulfate, chalk, wollastonite,
glass fibers or glass beads.
