<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic 
light-sensitive material and particularly to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material high in 
photosensitivity, low in fog, without producing any residual 
color-contamination and excellent in aging stability. In recent years, a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material has been required to have a rapid 
processability as well as a high photosensitivity and a high 
image-quality. Particularly, with a photographic light-sensitive 
material for medically diagnostic use, an image 
information has been required to be high in photosensitivity 
and an image sharpness within a short period of time when 
diagnosing the illness of a patient. Heretofore, many proposals for increasing the 
photosensitivity of a silver halide emulsion have been made so 
far. For example, Japanese Patent Open to Public Inspection 
(hereinafter referred to as JP OPI Publication) No. 63-305343/1988  
 
discloses that a spectral sensitivity is increased 
by adding a sensitizing dye before carrying out a chemical 
ripening treatment and a development speed is accelerated at 
the same time. However, in a rapid processing treatment, each of the 
time for fixing and washing treatments is shortened. 
Therefore, there raises such a problem that an sensitizing dye 
contained in a light-sensitive material is not dissolved out, 
so that it remains as a residual color-contamination. When 
reducing an amount of such a dye as mentioned above, a 
residual color-contamination may be avoided. However, it is 
not preferable because the photosensitivity of the subject 
light-sensitive material is lowered. On the other hand, well-known processes for chemically 
sensitizing silver halide grains include, for example, a 
selenium sensitization in which a selenium compound is used, 
as well as a sulfur sensitization, a noble-metal sensitization 
and a reduction sensitization. In the above-mentioned selenium sensitization process, 
however, on the other hand of the fact that a high 
photosensitivity can be obtained as compared to the other 
sensitization processes, there is such a defect that the raw 
stock preservability of a light-sensitive material cannot be 
excellent, so that a fog may be increasingly produced. 
Therefore, a further improvement thereof has been requested so 
far.  It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material high in 
photosensitivity, low in fog without producing any residual 
color-contamina
