<ABSTRACT>
Drive apparatus (2) for a cycle (4), which drive 
apparatus (2) comprises a frame (6), a motor (8), a 

first pulley (10) which is driven by the motor (8), a 
second pulley (12), and an endless belt (14) which 

passes around the two pulleys (10, 12) and which is 
driven by the first pulley (10), the drive apparatus (2) 

being such that during use the belt (14) is in driving 
engagement with a tyre (16) of a wheel (18) of the cycle 

(4), and the drive apparatus (2) being such that during 
use the first pulley (10) does not engage the tyre (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drive apparatus for 
a cycle. This invention also relates to a cycle when 
provided with the drive apparatus. It is known to provide drive apparatus for a 
cycle in which the drive apparatus comprises a motor 
which is an electric motor or an internal combustion 
engine motor. The motor is arranged to drive a roller 
which engages a tyre of a wheel of the cycle and which 
thus drives the wheel of the cycle. This type of drive 
suffers from low efficiency. The pressure of the roller 
on the tyre causes premature wear of the tyre. Still 
further, due to the relatively small diameter of the 
roller in relation to the wheel, a substantial amount of 
slippage occurs between the roller and the tyre. It is an aim of the present invention to 
provide drive apparatus which obviates or reduces the 
above mentioned problems. Accordingly, the present invention provides 
drive apparatus for a cycle, which drive apparatus 
comprises a frame, a motor, a first pulley which is 
driven by the motor, a second pulley, and an endless 
belt which passes around the two pullies and which is 
driven by the first pulley, the drive apparatus being 
such that during use the belt is in driving engagement  
 
with a tyre of a wheel of the cycle, and the drive 
apparatus also being such that during use the first 
pulley does not engage the tyre. The belt enables a large drive area to be 
present between the belt and the tyre. This avoids the 
premature tyre wear and the excess wear which occurs 
when a drive roller directly engages the tyre. For 
example, the drive area using the belt in the drive 
apparatus of the present invention may be twenty times 
as much as may be obtainable from the same motor if the 
drive is via a roller directly engaging the tyre. Still 
further, the use of the belt enables the drive apparatus 
to be used equally satisfactorily with a wide range of 
tyres. The cycle may be a bicycle, a tricycle or any 
other suitable and appropriate velociped. The drive apparatus may be one in which the 
first and the second pullies are the only pullies 
employed in the drive apparatus. Alternatively, if 
desired, other pullies may be employed in the drive 
apparatus. Preferably, the first pulley is attached to 
the motor. Other arrangements for driving the first 
pulley via the motor may however be employed. The size of the first pulley is a substantial 
factor in dictating the speed of the cycle. In the  
 
drive apparatus of the present invention, the size of 
the first pulley is advantageously

Drive apparatus for a cycle, which drive 
apparatus comprises a frame, a motor, a first pulley 

which is driven by the motor, a second pulley, and an 
endless belt which passes around the two pulleys and 

which is driven by the first pulley, the drive apparatus 
being such that during use the belt is in driving 

engagement with a tyre of a wheel of the cycle, and the 
drive apparatus also being such that during use the 

first pulley does not engage the tyre. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 1 in which 
the frame comprises a first frame part for supporting 

the motor, the first and second pulleys, and a second 
frame part for attaching to the cycle. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 2 in which 
the first and the second frame parts are hinged together 

with the first frame part being moveable under gravity 
relative to the second part, whereby the belt engages 

the tyre with a force which is at least partially 
determined by the weight of components on the first 

frame part. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 3 and 
including a flexible load-giving member for increasing 

the force with which the belt engages the tyre. 
Drive apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims in which the motor is an electric 

motor. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 5 in which 
the electric motor is provided with an electric current 

limiting device. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 6 in which 
the electric current limiting device comprises a length 

of wire which is such that its electrical resistance 
increases as its temperature increases, the electrical 

current limiting device being so connected to the 
electric motor that an overload condition causing the 

generation of heat in the electric motor also causes the 
generation of heat in the
 length of wire thereby to 
increase the temperature and the electrical resistance 

in the length of wire and to decrease the electric 
current allowed to pass to the electric motor. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 7 in which 
the length of wire is made of nickel. 
Drive apparatus according to claim 7 or claim 
8 in which the length of wire is in the form of a coil. 
Drive apparatus according to any one of claims 
7 to 9 in which the length of wire is provided in a 

sleeve device for preventing persons touching the length 
of wire and burning themselves when the length of wire 

is hot, and also for insulating the length of wire from 
adjacent metallic parts.
