<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for automatically carrying out temperature cycling in a multiplicity of sample tubes, each sample tube being closed by a closure and containing a predetermined volume of a liquid reaction mixture, which apparatus contains the following components:   a) a carrier which has an arrangement of chambers for receiving the sample tubes, each chamber being suitable for receiving one sample tube, and the carrier (33) comprising a material which has a high thermal conductivity and having an upper surface, a lower surface and a cylindrical outer wall, each of the chambers (27) of the carrier (33) having an opening which lies in the upper surface of the carrier,   b) a computer-operated control device, and c) means controlled by the control device for cyclic change of the temperature of the carrier. To reduce the dimensions of the apparatus and the necessary power supply for its operation, the apparatus is characterised in that the arrangement of the chambers (27) in the carrier (33) is annular and in that the closure (87) of each sample tube (21) can be pierced by a pipetting needle (32).

A device for automatic performance of polymerase
chain reactions in a number of test tubes, each test

tube being closed by a lid and containing a
predetermined volume of a liquid reaction mixture,

the device containing the following components:

(a) a holder (33) having an annular arrangement
of chambers (27) for holding the test tubes, each

chamber being adapted to receive the lower part of a
test tube (21), said holder (33) consisting of a

material which has a high thermal conductivity and
having an upper surface, a bottom surface, and a

cylindrical outer wall, each of the chambers (27) of
the holder (33) having an opening located in the

upper surface of the holder,
(b) test tubes (21) disposed in the chambers
(27) of the holder (33) and each closed by a lid

(87),
(c) a computer-controlled automatic control
system, and
(d) means controlled by the automatic control
system for cyclic alteration of the temperature of

the holder, the temperature cycles being adapted to
the performance of polymerase chain reactions in the

test tubes,
 
   which device is characterised in that


(i) the lids (87) of the test tubes (21) are
adapted to be pierced by the pipetting needle (32)

of an automatic pipetting device (14) for the
removal of a volume of the reaction mixture

contained in the test tube, and
(ii) it comprises a hinged lid (28) for
securing the closed test tubes (21) disposed in the

holder (33), which lid (28) has per chamber (27) an
opening (29) through which the lid (87) of the test

tube (21) contained in the chamber (27) can be
pierced with the pipetting needle (32) of an

automatic pipetting device (14).
A process for the amplification of nucleic
acids, in which process


(a) a sample suspected of containing a nucleic
acid sequence for detection and suitable reagents

for the amplification of such a nucleic acid
sequence are introduced into a test tube to form a

reaction mixture,
(b) the reaction mixture is sealed in the test
tube, the latter being closed by a hermetically

sealing closure,
(c) the nucleic acid sequence for detection is
amplified in the test tube by a process which 

comprises temperature cycling of the reaction
mixture contained in the test tube,

   characterised in that

(i) a device according to claim 1 is used for
performing the process,
(ii) after the amplification step a portion of
the reaction mixture is removed from the test tube

without opening the test tube (21), the closure (87)
of the test tube (21) being pierced by a pipetting

needle for the removal and the said portion of the
reaction mixture is sucked into the pipetting needle

and
(iii) the removed portion of the reaction
mixture is introduced into a test tube (8).
A process according to claim 2, characterised in
that the test tube (21) is disposed in an automatic

device containing an automatic pipetting device for
performing the removal and dispensing of the portion

of the reaction mixture.
