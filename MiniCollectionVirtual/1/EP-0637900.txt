<ABSTRACT>
To avoid the accumulation of negative charges on 
a satellite (S), it is proposed to use a photocathode (1) 

possibly associated with accelerating electrodes (21, 
23) - which emits electrons when it is struck by light 

radiation from a suitable source (3). The photocathode is 
connected to the satellite and can expel electrons from 

the satellite, thus controlling its potential with 
respect to the surrounding environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and to a device 
for controlling the electrical potential of a space 
vehicle or of its parts with respect to the electrical 
potential of the environment in which the satellite 
moves. It is well known that in an ionospheric environment 
the presence of charged particles produced by the 
ionization of the atmospheric gases, generated by cosmic 
rays and by solar radiation, frequently causes the 
electrostatic charging of the satellite. Charged 
particles present in the environment in which the satellite 
moves are deposited on the metal and dielectric 
parts of the satellite, causing an electrical charging of 
the satellite with the consequent formation of a potential 
difference (and therefore an electrical field) 
between the space vehicle and its environment and/or 
between certain parts of the space vehicle and other 
parts thereof and/or between certain parts of the satellite 
and the environment. The presence of a potential difference between 
the satellite and the environment (known as the "space 
vehicle charging phenomenon") may reach high values, up 
to tens of kV. The electrical fields formed in the vicinity of 
the vehicle may give rise to surface and body electrical 
discharges with consequent phenomena of generation of 
electromagnetic waves. The presence of such phenomena may 
cause effects varying from the incorrect operation of the 
analog and digital on-board electrical instrumentation to 
the actual damage of said instrumentation. This phenomenon 
is also dangerous for any personnel on board the 
satellite in the case of possible extra-vehicular 
missions and any docking maneuvers between different 
vehicles (for example, a space shuttle and an orbiting  
 
station). The methods currently used to limit or prevent 
the space vehicle electrical charging phenomena are of 
two types: passive and active. The former use "grounding techniques" (electrical 
connection between the various parts of the satellite) 
combined with the use of special conductive coatings on 
the surfaces of the satellite to limit the deposition of 
the charges originating from the environment; the latter 
use active means which cause the expulsion from the 
satellite of the charges accumulated there. The passive methods do not yield completely 
satisfactory results, since it has not yet been possible 
to cover the surfaces of the satellites completely with 
the coating. Furthermore, this technology is expensive 
and subject to easy deterioration. The active methods are generally
