<ABSTRACT>
In a portable telephone set, an earphone cord (14) is a flat 
cord. Therefore, it is difficult for the flat cord to be 

twisted, so that the tangling of the flat cord is avoided. 
The motion of the flat cord in which the flat cord is pulled out 

of a main body (12) in operation and contained therein in non-operation 
is conveyed to an antenna (18), so that the antenna is 

extended out of the main body in operation, and the antenna is 
contained in the main body in non-operation. In the same 

manner, the motion of the antenna is conveyed to the flat cord.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radio telephone set, and
more particularly, to a portable telephone set for carrying out
the radio communication by use of an earphone cord connected to
a main body.A first conventional portable telephone set comprises
a main body and a cover body, wherein the cover body is hinged
to the main body, so that the main and cover bodies take the
position of "close" in a non-use state and "open" in a used
state. The main body is provided with a speaker, a display,
and an antenna and the cover body is provided with operation keys
(buttons) and a microphone.In the used state, the cover body is opened from the
main body, and the antenna is pulled out of the main body.
Thus, the speaker of the main body is placed on an ear of a user,
and the microphone of the cover body is positioned in the
vicinity of a mouth of the user.In the first conventional portable telephone set,
however, there is a disadvantage in that the size is large. In
other words, the thickness is large, when the main and cover
bodies are closed in the non-used state, and the length is large,
when the main body is opened by hinging the cover body in the
used state. A second conventional portable telephone set comprises
a main body which is provided with a display, operation keys, an
antenna, a microphone, and an earphone.In the second conventional portable telephone set, the
earphone is connected to the main body by an earphone cord, so
that a speaker is not necessary to be provided. Consequently,
the cover body as explained in the first conventional portable
telephone set can be eliminated to make the size of the portable
telephone set small.In the second conventional portable telephone set,
however, there is a disadvantage in that the earphone cord is
tangled to lower the manipulation thereof by a user, because the
earphone cord is thin and flexible. Further, there is a
disadvantage in that the earphone cord is difficult to be pulled
into a cord container, if the earphone cord is tangled.Patent Abstracts of Japan, volume 16, no. 64 (E-1167),
February 18, 1992 discloses a portable telephone set having
a main body and an earphone connected to the main body via a
connection cord. The connecting cord of the earphone is
wound on a winding reel accommodated in a case. By the means
of a lock mechanism the winding reel may be locked or
released.Patent Abstracts of Japan, volume 13, no. 378 (E-809),
August 22, 1989 discloses an automatic cable winding type
earphone device. In the event of using the earphone, the
flat cable is

A portable telephone set with an earphone (39),
comprising:


a main body (31) containing telephone communication circuits
including a sound generating circuit therein and having operation 

keys (33) and a microphone (34) thereon;
an antenna (35) vertically moving to be extended out of said
main body (31) in operation state and to be contained in said main

body (31) in non-operation state;
an earphone cord (40) for connecting said earphone (39) to said
sound generating circuit, said earphone cord (40) being pulled out of

said main body (31) in said operation state and contained in said main
body (31) in said non-operation state; and characterized by
means (40-45) for correlating movements between said antenna (35)
and said earphone cord (40);
wherein when one of said antenna (35) and said earphone cord (40)
is extended out of said main body (31), a remaining one of said

antenna (35) and said earphone cord (40) is extended out of said main body (31)
by said correlating means (40-45), and when said one is contained in said

main body (31), said remaining one is contained in said main body (31) by
said correlating means (40-45).

according to claim 2, wherein:


said correlating means (40-45) comprises a movable pulley (44)
vertically moving responsive to moving of said antenna (35); and
a pulley (41-43) fixed to said main body (31);
a first end (45) of said flat cord (40) being fixed to said main 
body (31), a second end of said flat cord (40) being connected to said

earphone (39), and said flat cord (40) being suspended by said movable
pulley (44) and said fixed pulley (41-43).
A portable telephone set with an earphone (39),
according to claim 2 or 3, wherein:


said correlating means comprises a reel (48) rotating
responsive to moving of said antenna (35); and
a pulley (49) fixed to said main body (31);
a first end of said flat cord (40) being wound on said reel (48),
a second end of said flat cord (40) being connected to said earphone (39),

and said flat cord (40) being suspended between said first and second
ends by said fixed pulley (49).
A portable telephone set with an earphone (39),
according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein:
