<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning system for increasing the packing density of a cleaner sump (30) that uses 
magnetic toner (70), by filling unused sump space. A cleaning blade (20) cleans magnetic toner 

from a surface (11) and the cleaned off toner is stored in the sump. The cleaning system uses a 
magnetic force to attract the magnetic waste toner to the sump area not filled by gravity 

assistance alone. The magnetic force is created by a magnet (40). The magnet can be either 
internal to the sump or external thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus for cleaning magnetic material, and more
particularly, concerns increasing the capacity of the cleaner sump.One of the constraints on the life of a Customer Replaceable Unit (CRU) is the
capacity of the cleaner sump. This constraint is especially true for small copiers or printers
which must avoid toner transportation devices that limit the sump capacity to that of the
volume that can be reached by gravity assisted flow alone. Once all the gravity assisted flow
assessable volume is filled, the pressure on the cleaning blade and on the sealing Mylar trade mark of E.I. DuPont flap (i.e.
the flap prevents waste toner from leaking from the sump) starts building up resulting in a
cleaner failure. The cleaner failure is either a toner spill through a lower seal or failure to clean
adequately. The CRU life can be extended by utilizing more of the available sump capacity that
is not filled by gravity assisted flow alone, to prolong the cleaner failures occurring due to
pressure on the cleaning blade and flap.The following disclosures may be relevant to various aspects of the present invention
and may be briefly summarized as follows:US-A-4,547,063 to Stange discloses a moving magnet cleaner for scraping excess
toner off of a photoreceptor surface. The moving magnet cleaner provides carrier bristles for
brushing the photoreceptor surface. The sweeping of the moving magnet cleaner past the
photoreceptor provides a self-leveling of the carrier bristles to the size of the distance between
the cleaner roll and the photoreceptor surface. A toner roll rotates in proximity to the cleaner
roll to transfer toner from the carrier particles to the toner roll and also provides self-leveling of
the carrier bristles. The carrier for the magnet cleaner is continually replaced with carrier from
a sump and the moving magnet cleaner exhibits a large cleaning zone allowing for gentle
removal of the toner from the photoreceptor.US-A-4,671,207 to Hilbert discloses a magnetic brush development apparatus for
applying developer material to a latent image on a photoconductor which includes a housing
having a sump which receives a supply of developer material. A magnetic brush spaced from
the sump applies the material to the latent image of a photoconductor as a photoconductor is
moved past a magnetic brush. A feed mechanism delivers developer material from the sump
through a slot to the magnetic brush. The feed mechanism includes a rotatable shell and a
plurality of magnets that are

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning magnetic material from a surface (11) comprising:

a housing defining a chamber (80) for storing magnetic material (70) removed from the surface;
a cleaning member (20) disposed at least partially in the chamber (80) of said housing for
removing the magnetic material from the surface, said cleaning member (20) comprising a blade in

contact with the surface; and
magnet means (60) located remotely from said cleaning member (20) and positioned to
attract and move the magnetic material for packing the magnetic material into portions of the

chamber additional to those portions of the chamber filled by gravity assisted filling;

   characterised in that the magnet means (60) comprises a rotatable magnet (60) located
outside said chamber (20) adjacent thereto.
An apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the chamber (80) of said housing
includes an indentation adapted to accommodate at least part of said magnet (60) during rotation

thereof.
An apparatus as recited in claim 1 or 2, further including a fixed magnet (40) which
is mounted in an upper position of the chamber (80) of said housing.
