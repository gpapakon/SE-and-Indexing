<ABSTRACT>
An adhesiveless optical fiber connector utilizes a mechanical gripping element (22) to hold the fiber in place. The gripping element will receive an optical fiber when it is disengaged and hold the fiber when engaged. It is engageable by moving a plug (20) in a direction transverse to the fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
Optical fiber connectors commonly use ferrules to insure alignment
of the fibers. Typically two fibers that are to be connected are inserted into
housings having matching ferrules attached thereto. The ends of the fibers are
then polished to produce a smooth optical finish and the ferrules are inserted into
a central housing that holds them close together and in precise alignment.The term "connector" is often used in a variety of ways in the field
of fiber optics. Sometimes it is used to refer to two of the housings with ferrules
as described above along with the central housing. At other times it is used to
refer to a single housing with a ferrule. This later definition will be adopted
herein. Thus, in order to connect two optical fibers, two connectors and a central
housing are required.The ferrules used in fiber optic connectors come in many shapes and
can be of many of different materials. Typically the ferrules are of a ceramic
material, although metallic or plastic materials can also be used. The ferrule may
be cylindrical, as in the widely used ST connector defined by proposed EIA
Specification 475E000 or in an SC connector, or it may be a truncated cone as in
the case of a biconic connector.In order to insure a good optical connection, as well as the structural
integrity of the connector, the fiber must be tightly bound in the connector.
Typically this is done by use of an adhesive. Most commonly an epoxy is used
to hold a fiber in a connector housing and ferrule. Once an epoxy has hardened,
it cannot be loosened. Thus, if a fiber is incorrectly installed in a connector
housing and ferrule, or is damaged subsequent to such installation, the housing and
ferrule cannot be reused. US-A-4,984,865 describes the
use of a hot melt adhesive to hold a fiber in a fiber optic connector. While this 
has the advantage of being reusable, it requires that the assembly be heated above
the softening temperature of the adhesive upon either insertion or removal of a
fiber.A disadvantage of both epoxies and hot melt adhesives is that both
require a delay from the time the fiber is installed in order to harden the adhesive.
In addition a hot melt adhesive always requires the use of a heating fixture. The
heating future, in turn, must be powered, sometimes causing inconvenience. An
epoxy does not necessarily require the use of a heating fixture, but, for the epoxies
typically used in fiber optic connectors, the cure period will be several hours if no
heat is applied. Thus epoxies offer a tradeoff between the
