<ABSTRACT>
The continuous casting machine includes two contra-rotating rolls (1, 2) with parallel axes arranged opposite each other, with a certain spacing, and on the axial ends of which two side walls (5a) bear so as to define a casting space (3) between the rolls. The device for rapidly changing the side wall (5a) includes a small barrel (14) comprising fastening means (16) for at least two side walls (5) in positions resulting from one another by means of a rotation through a specific angle about the axis of the small barrel. Means for rotationally displacing the small barrel in steps having an amplitude corresponding to the specific angle of rotation make it possible to displace a replacement side wall (5b) from a standby position to a position occupied by the active side wall (5a) to be replaced.

<CLAIMS>
Device for rapidly changing and holding in place 
a side wall of a machine for continuously casting a metal 

product, including two counterrotating rolls (1, 2) 
having parallel axes and arranged facing each other with 

a certain spacing, against the ends of which two side 
walls (5) bear so as to demarcate a casting space (3) 

between the rolls and including a carriage (8) for moving 
the side wall (5), this carriage being mounted so as to 

move on a support (6) in the axial direction of the rolls 
between a forward position and a set-back position with 

respect to the rolls, characterized in that it furthermore 
includes: 


a barrel (14), mounted so as to rotate on the 
carriage (8) about an axis perpendicular to the axis of 

the rolls (1, 2) and provided with means (16) for fixing 
at least two side walls (5) in positions which can be 

derived from each other by a rotation through a defined 
angle about the axis of the barrel (14), and 
means (18, 19, 20, 21, 22) for rotationally 
moving the barrel (14) in steps of amplitude corresponding 

to the said defined angle of rotation so as to 
move a replacement side wall (5b) from a stand-by 

position to a position occupied by an in-service side 
wall (5a) to be replaced. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the barrel (14) is mounted so as to rotate about a 

vertical axis. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the barrel (44) is mounted so as to rotate about a  

 
horizontal axis. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the means (16) for fixing the side 

walls (5) include, for each of the side walls, a support 
(30a) to which the side wall is fixed and means (31, 32, 

34, 35) of linkage between the support of the side wall 
(5) and a plane wall (47) of the corresponding barrel. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the barrel includes two plane walls (47'a, 47'b) 

parallel to each other, the positions of which are 
derived from each other by a rotation of one half-turn of 

the barrel about its axis. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the barrel (14; 44) includes plane walls (16; 47) 

which are perpendicular in pairs and arranged as the 
faces of a parallelepiped, and the positions of which are 

derived from each other by a rotation of the barrel 
through a quarter of a turn. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the barrel (14) includes three walls (16a, 16b, 16c) 

which are perpendicular in pairs. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the barrel includes four walls which are perpendicular 

in pairs. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the means for rotationally moving 

the barrel (14) are associated with limit stops (24, 26) 
fixed to the carriage (8) and the barrel (14), so as to 

limit the rotational movement of the barrel to a step of 
amplitude corresponding to the defined angle of rotation. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it includes heating means for preheating a replacement 

side wall (5b) in the stand-by position.
