<DESCRIPTION>
 IGNITION CIRCUIT HAVING DEVICE TO SHORTEN INDUCTIVE DISCHARGE PHASE OFA SPARK EVENTThe present invention relates to electrical circuits for use with spark ignition internal combustion engines.In co-pending PCT/GB91/01928 of common ownership herewith, we describe the use of capacitors in combination with other electrical devices in the spark ignition circuits of internal combustion engines. A conventional spark broadly comprises two constituent parts; a first part consisting of a relatively high currenÏ„, short duration "bright-line" spark discharge, often referred to as the capacitive discharge phase; and a second part consisting of a lower current, longer duration glow discharge or "flaring" discharge, often referred to as the inductive discharge phase. The bright-line discharge is a high temperature spark, and lasts for a relatively small proportion of the total spark time and which although it constitutes the means by which the combustion event is initiated, produces only a relatively small quantity of hear. The flaring discharge phase, is on the other hand, a relatively lower temperature discharge, but lasts for the greatest portion of the total spark duration time, and produces a relatively high quantity of heat compared to the bright-line discharge. 

 We have found that the flaring discharge is associated with harmful effects, both on engine components and on the combustion quality per se. The relatively high heating effect of this part of the spark causes premature erosion of the spark plug electrodes, thus unnecessarily shortening the life of the spark plugs, and contributes to unnecessarily high exhaust gas emissions. We believe that the spark plug electrode erosion is attributable to the flaring discharge heating the electrodes to a temperature substantially above that consequent on the effects of the combustion event per se. Furthermore, we believe that the long duration, lower temperature flaring discharge part of the spark promotes undesirable chemical reactions in the fuel charge during the combustion event, resulting in unnecessarily high exhaust emission levels.However, we have now found that the beneficial effects of the invention as described in our co-pending PCT/GB91/01928 may be substantially further improved by removing only a controlled portion of the flaring discharge part of the spark. We have now found that if too much of the flaring discharge is removed from the spark event, then a proportion of the available improvement in engine performance is sacrificed, whilst if too
