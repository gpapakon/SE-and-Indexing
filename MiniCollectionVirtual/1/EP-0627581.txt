<ABSTRACT>
In a metallic gasket in which a plate member (1) 
having at least one flexible metal plate (1-1,1-2) has a 

hole (5), a flat portion (14) formed at the periphery of 
the hole and a bead (2-1,2-2) disposed concentrically 

with the hole to the outside of the flat portion and a 
plate member (12) is sandwiched between joining faces, 

an annular stopper (6) is secured to the plate member at 
a position corresponding to the flat portion (14) on the 

side of the hole (5), and the stopper is made of a metal 
material different from the plate member and formed to 

an increased thickness at a portion for a larger gap, 
and formed to a decreased thickness at a portion for a 

smaller gap depending on the difference for the size of 
the gap between the joining faces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a metallic gasket
disposed between joining faces of a cylinder head and
a cylinder block that constitute an internal combustion
engine, to prevent combustion gas blow through, and
cooling water and lubricant or the like from leaking.In an internal combustion engine, a gasket is interposed
between a cylinder block and a cylinder head to
provide a seal between them. In particular, a seal at the
periphery of a combustion chamber, that is, a cylinder
bore is important and, if the seal is defective at that portion,
the combustion gas in the bore blows out to decrease
the gas pressure efficiency and the expected
power output can not be obtained.The gasket materials for a gasoline engine use a
mixture of asbestos and rubber, having a spiked steel
plate embedded therein. A bore side peripheral edge
covered with a stainless steel plate and the peripheral
edge of bolt holes covered with a copper plate respectively,
are used countermeasure for a gap between the
edge seal and the joining faces.Further, for a diesel engine, a material comprising
a mixture of asbestos and rubber and a wire gauze embedded
therein is used as a countermeasure for a gap
at the edge seal and the joining faces as described
above and a fire ring is further engaged along the edge
of the bore.Such gaskets are referred to as soft gaskets. However,
since asbestos is used in this gaskets, the use has
become restricted, particularly, in view of environmental
problems.As far as the inventor knows, synthetic fibers are
used instead of asbestos in gasoline engines. Further,
for diesel engines, a structure comprising a steel laminate
including a steel plate formed with a minute bead,
a stainless steel subplate stacked thereon and a steel
wire core is disposed to the bore peripheral edge. The
subplate is folded back to cover the wire on the inside
and extends along the upper surface of the edge of the
bore hole. A baked rubber seal is disposed at the bolt
holes.Further, there are also gasket as shown in Fig. 8 in
which a stopper 4 comprising a shim is formed at a flat
portion adjacent a bead 2 of an elastic steel iron base
plate 1 on the side of a bore hole, a gasket as shown in
Fig. 7 in which a stopper 3 formed by arc plasma spray
at a flat portion adjacent a bead 2 of an elastic base
plate 1 on the side of a bore hole, and a gasket with two
intermediate plates bent outside with each other to open
at a bore edge to which a stopper is formed also by arc
plasma spray although not illustrated.The soft gaskets are not

a plate member (1) comprises a laminate structure (Fig. 2) of two elastic metal
base plates (1-1, 1-2) and an intermediate plate (12) therebetween;
each base plate (1-1, 1-2) has a flat portion (14) at the periphery of a hole (5) in
the plate member (1), and a bead (2-1, 2-2) disposed to the outside of the flat portion

(14) concentrically with the hole (5);
the crests of the beads (2-1, 2-2) are opposed to each other;
compensation means of variable thickness is provided between the flat portions
(14) of the base plates (1-1, 1-2);
the compensation means comprises an annular stopper (6) radially inside the
beads (2-1, 2-2), the annular stopper being adjacent the hole (5) in the plate member

(1);
the thickness of the annular stopper (6) varies circumferentially; and
the annular stopper (6) is a separate metal plate different from the intermediate
plate (12);

   
characterised in that
:

the annular stopper (6) is press formed and is thicker than the intermediate plate
(12); and
an outer peripheral face of the annular stopper (6) is welded to an inner
peripheral face of the intermediate plate (12) so that an inner peripheral face of the

annular stopper is aligned with inner peripheral faces of the two base plates (1-1,1-2).

periphery is larger, and after forming, the annular stopper (6) has horizontally extending

upper and lower surfaces from a lateral mid portion to the inner periphery, the
maximum thickness (l
