<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simplified 
adaptive braking system that does not require wheel speed 
sensors. Conventional antilock braking systems for road 
vehicles generally control braking action in response to a 
signal proportional to wheel speed. This signal is indicative 
of wheel slip, wheel acceleration and/or deceleration. Wheel 
speed is often generated by using wheel speed sensors and 
associated tone wheels for each controlled wheel or wheels of 
the vehicle. These wheel speed sensors are compared to 
control signals, the combination of which are utilized to 
sense wheel skid or impending skid and to appropriately 
control brake pressure so as to maintain the skidding wheel in 
a rotating condition. Ultimately one desires to control the 
skid and braking characteristic of each front and rear wheels 
of a vehicle such that each of the tires generate stopping 
forces which are as near the maximum attainable forces. These 
systems are characterized by the aforementioned wheel speed 
sensors and tone wheels, a plurality of isolation valves (in 
multi-channel systems), pressure decay valves and pressure 
release valves, which are each sequenced by a control unit. 
These all-wheel adaptive braking systems work adequately but 
present a relatively large cost to the vehicle owner. US-A-3664713 discloses an antilock braking system in 
which brake pressure is relieved when the sign of the rate of 
change of vehicle deceleration and the sign of the rate of 
change of the like brake pressure are not the same.  
 Accordingly the invention comprises: A method and 
system for of controlling the operation of vehicle 
brakes and associated wheels. The brake system 
includes a master cylinder controlled by the operator 
of the vehicle to vary applied brake pressure to 
various brake mechanisms during normal service brake 
operation and an antiskid brake subsystem, activated 
when one or more vehicle wheels are skidding, for 
controlling brake pressure in the various brake 
mechanisms to permit various wheels to operate in a 
nonskidding manner. The method comprises the steps of: 
1.1) determining a control relationship k 
between vehicle deceleration and applied brake 
pressure, with none of the wheels of the vehicle 
skidding; 1.2) measuring at least two values (P₁P₂) of 
applied brake pressure to determine a change in 
applied brake pressure Δ P during a measurement 
interval; 1.3) calculating the change in control 
deceleration Δ Dci corresponding to the change Δ P 
in applied brake pressure
