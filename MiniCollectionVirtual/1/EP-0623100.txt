<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for extracting
oil from oil-bearing material, for example carbonaceous
material, comprising the steps of (i) introducing an oil-bearing
material into an extraction zone, (ii) introducing a
normally gaseous solvent into said extraction zone, under
conditions of pressure and temperature that are effective for
liquefying the normally gaseous solvent, thereby resulting in
extraction of at least a portion of said oil, (iii) passing
the resulting mixture of extracted oil and solvent to a
separation zone wherein the solvent is separated from the
extracted oil, (iv) collecting the extracted oil, and (v)
collecting the normally gaseous solvent in the gaseous state
for recycle to said extraction zone. Such an oil extraction
process is disclosed in US-A-4 898 673.In many instances the characteristics of a particular
carbonaceous material can be altered by the removal of certain
compounds from the material. Examples of some compounds which it
may be desirable to remove would include: phospholipids, fats,
fatty acids, alcohols, waxes, gums, stearols, oil soluble proteins,
flavonol, mineral oils, essential oils, and PCB's. More particularly, oils derived from plant materials, such as
oil-seeds, cereal brans, fruits, beans, and nuts, are the source of
raw material for many important commercial products. For example,
such oils from such plant materials are extensively used in
cooking, low fat and fat free cooked food, in cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals as carriers for insecticides and fungicides, in
lubricants, and in myriad other useful products. Consequently,
much work has been done over the years in developing improved
processes for extracting oil from such materials.One of the most widely used processes for removing oil from
oil-bearing materials is solvent extraction. In solvent
extraction, the oil-bearing material is treated with a suitable
solvent, usually the lower carbon alkanes such as hexane, at 
elevated temperatures and low pressures, to extract the oil from
the oil-bearing material. The resulting solvent/oil mixture is
then fractionated to separate the valuable oil from the solvent,
which is recycled. Most solvent extraction processes in commercial
use today employ hexane as the solvent. While hexane extraction is
the most widely used today, there are also teachings in the art in
which normally gaseous solvents are used at both supercritical and
subcritical conditions.One such teaching is found in U.S. Patent No. 1,802,533
to Reid, wherein a normally gaseous solvent,

A process for extracting oil from an oil-bearing
material, comprising the steps of (i) introducing an oil-bearing

material into an extraction zone, (ii) introducing a
normally gaseous solvent into said extraction zone, under

conditions of pressure and temperature that are effective for
liquefying the normally gaseous solvent, thereby resulting in

extraction of at least a portion of said oil, (iii) passing
the resulting mixture of extracted oil and solvent to a

separation zone wherein the solvent is separated from the
extracted oil, (iv) collecting the extracted oil, and (v)

collecting the normally gaseous solvent in the gaseous state
for recycle to said extraction zone;

   characterised in that (a) said oil extraction process is
one in which steps (i) to (iii) are performed in succession,

(b) the introduced oil-bearing material forms a bed of such
material in said extraction zone, (c) air is evacuated from

said extraction zone prior to step (ii) and (d) said mixture
of extracted oil and solvent is passed to the separation zone

in step (iii) under conditions that will maintain the solvent

in the liquid state by introducing into said extraction zone a
gas which at a given temperature liquefies at a higher

pressure than the solvent.
A process according to claim 1, wherein said oil-bearing
material is a cooked food product. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the normally
gaseous solvent is selected from propane, butane, and mixtures

thereof.
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
evacuation of air from said extraction zone prior to step (ii)

is performed by introducing a gas, having dissimilar
vaporisation condition characteristics from the solvent, into

said extraction zone to displace said solvent in the liquid
state and extracted oil from said extraction zone while

maintaining said temperature and pressure conditions in said
extraction zone.
A process according to claim 4, wherein the gas having
dissimilar vaporisation characteristics from the solvent is an

inert gas.
A process according to claim 5, wherein the normally
gaseous solvent is propane and the inert gas is nitrogen or

carbon dioxide.
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the
oil-bearing material is selected from soybeans, cottonseed,

linseed, rice bran, wheat bran, corn meal and cocoa.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein the
normally gaseous solvent is periodically stressed by

fluctuating the pressure in the extraction zone by at least
0.25 psig (103 KPa). 
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein a co-solvent
is used, which co-solvent is selected from the C

6

alcohol.
A process according to claim 2 or any one of claims 3 to
9 as appended to claim 2, wherein the cooked food product is a

fried food product.
A process according to claim 9, wherein the fried food
product is potato chips or french fried potatoes.
A process according to claim 2, wherein the cooked food
product is a meat food product.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the evacuation of
air from the extraction zone is effected by applying a vacuum.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein
vacuum is applied to the separation zone after the solvent has

been separated from the extracted oil.
