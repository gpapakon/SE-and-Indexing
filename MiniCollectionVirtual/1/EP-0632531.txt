<ABSTRACT>
A battery terminal that can be firmly clamped to the 
battery post by tightening a bolt from the horizontal 

direction to improve the productivity of the bolt tightening 
operation is provided. The battery terminal has on the 

terminal main body a ring-shaped post fitting member (20) 
continuous to the cable fitting member, and a pair of right 

and left tightening members (21A, 21B, 21A', 21B') continuous 
to the respective free ends of the post fitting member and 

having a gap therebetween. The tightening members are brought 
together by a nut and bolt (12, 13) to close the free ends of 

the post fitting member continuous thereto, thus clamping the 
battery terminal to the outside circumference of the battery 

post. The pair of right and left tightening members projecting 
from the post fitting member are provided at a rising 

slope of a predetermined angle to the post fitting member. 
A vertical bearing plate (22) is provided on the outside 

surface of the upward-projecting part of each of the right and 
left tightening members, and a bolt is passed through the bolt 

hole of the bearing plate at a position above the terminal 
main body for tightening in the horizontal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a battery terminal 
for mounting to the post of a battery mounted in a motor vehicle, 
and relates particularly to a battery terminal wherein the 
tightening position of the bolt is placed above the terminal 
main body, and the battery terminal is firmly clamped to the 
battery post by tightening said bolt from the horizontal 
direction. A conventional battery terminal of this type (see US-A-4 747 793) is 
shown in Fig. 4. A ring-shaped post fitting member 3a is fit 
over the battery post projecting from the battery, and right 
and left tightening members 3c are provided continuous to the 
free ends of the post fitting member 3a and projecting 
horizontally therefrom. A bolt 4 is passed horizontally 
through the right and left tightening members 3c, and is 
tightened using an impact wrench or similar tool from the side 
(horizontal direction) to close the tightening members 3c and 
thus clamp the post fitting member 3a to the battery post. A modified battery terminal of this type has been 
proposed (Japanese utility patent laid-open number 1992-7567) 
and is shown in Fig. 5. With this battery terminal, a base  
 
member 3b and tightening member 3c are provided in mutual 
opposition and at an angle to the axis of the post fitting 
member 3a of the terminal 3. A bolt 4 is placed in the bolt 
holes provided in the base member 3b and tightening member 3c, 
and thus at an angle to the axis of the post fitting member 
3a, and a nut 6 is tightened onto the bolt 4 by means of an 
impact wrench 5 held at an angle above the terminal 3 assembly 
to clamp the post fitting member 3a to the battery post. Space inside the engine room of most recent 
vehicles, however, is limited due to the large number of 
engine room components. This makes it difficult to adequately 
tighten the terminal fitting by applying a horizontal force 
from a point near the battery top with a battery terminal as 
shown in Fig. 4 because of interference between other engine 
room components and the impact wrench. It is even possible 
for the impact wrench to contact the negative terminal while 
tightening the positive terminal fitting, causing an electrical 
short. With a conventional battery terminal as shown in 
Fig. 5, the base member 3b and tightening member 3c are formed 
by twisting them to an angle relative to the axial direction 
of the post fitting member 3a so that the nut 6 can be 
tightened from a position above and at an angle to the 
terminal 3. However, because the tightening direction of the 
bas

<CLAIMS>
A battery terminal for clamping a battery post, 
comprising: 


a cable fitting member (16) for connecting a cable; 
a ring-shaped post fitting member (20) integral with 
said cable fitting member (16) and being opened to define 

free ends having a predetermined gap (S) therebetween; 
first and second tightening members (21A, 21B; 21A', 
21B') integral with said free ends, respectively, said first 

and second tightening members being bent upwardly at a 
predetermined angle from said free ends; 
first and second vertical bearing plates (22, 22) 
on the outside surface of said first and second tightening 

members (21A, 21B), each of said first and second vertical 
bearing plates having a bolt hole; and 
a nut and bolt (12, 13) extended through said bolt 
holes, whereby the tightening members are brought together to 

close the free ends, thus clamping the battery terminal to the 
outside circumference of the battery post. 
A battery terminal as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 
each of said first and second tightening members (21A, 21B, 

21A', 21B') is formed by a U-shaped member having two beams 
(21A, 21B, 21A', 21B').  

 
A battery terminal as claimed in Claim 2, wherein 
each of said first and second bearing plates (22, 22) is 

connected between said two beams.
