<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of Pasteurella haemolytica
vaccines. More particularly, the invention relates to a bacterin-toxoid
vaccine capable of inducing immunity in bovine species in one dose against
Pasteurella haemolytica Type A-1 infections comprising Pasteurella
haemolytica derived leukotoxoid, capsular antigen, soluble antigens and
inactivated cells, methods to make the vaccine and methods of vaccinating
bovine animals.Approximately 40% to 80% of all diseases of cattle involve the
respiratory system (Lillie LE: "The bovine respiratory disease complex."
Can Vet J 15:233-242, 1974). Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is
a major problem in the U.S. cattle industry. BRDC consists of several 
clinical syndromes, the two most common being shipping fever of feedlot
cattle and enzootic calf pneumonia usually seen in dairy calves. While it is
now recognized that numerous viruses, stressful management practices,
and environmental factors are important in the genesis of shipping fever, P.
haemolytica biotype A, serotype 1 (Type A-1) is the main bacterial agent
responsible for the clinical disease and pathophysiologic events leading to
acute fibrinous lobar pleuropneumonia and subsequent death (Yates WDG:
"A review of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, shipping fever pneumonia
and viral-bacterial synergism in respiratory disease of cattle." Can J Comp
Med 46:225-263, 1982).In a two year study conducted in Saskatchewan, Canada, P.
haemolytica Type A-1 was isolated from the lungs of 74% of cattle that died
of shipping fever pneumonia (Schiefer B, Ward GE, Moffatt RE:
"Correlation of microbiological and histological findings in bovine fibrinous
pneumonia." Vet Pathol 15:313-321, 1978). Annual progress reports during
the five year period 1987 to 1991 from the Department of Veterinary
Science at South Dakota State University (South Dakota State University,
Department of Veterinary Science, Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic
Laboratory: Annual Progress Reports 1987-1991. Submitted to the NC107
Technical Committee on Bovine Respiratory Disease.) revealed that P.
haemolytica Type A-1 was isolated from 48.7% of bovine pneumonic lungs.
Thus, it appears to be the major bacterial agent causing pneumonia in
cattle.P. haemolytica serotype Type A-1 is the pathogen responsible for the
fibrinous necrotizing lobar pleuropneumonia seen in shipping fever and
purulent bronchopneumonia associated with enzootic calf pneumonia.
Interestingly, other P. haemolytica serotypes (frequently ST2 and ST4 and
occasionally
