<ABSTRACT>
A transporting and locating device (1) for bar-shaped workpieces (4) which can be fed to a machining centre (2) and are to be machined in the latter consists of a slide (11) traversable on a fixed rail (10), and a multiplicity of vices (21) which can be coupled to the slide (11) and in which the workpiece (4) is held by means of adjustable gripping jaws (22, 23), and actuating members (servo means 31, 41, 51) for opening the gripping jaws (22, 23) and for releasing the connection between the slide (11) and the vices (21). This configuration, by joint opening of all requisite vices (21), enables the workpiece (4) to be inserted into the vices (21) and fed to the machining centre (2) by means of the slide (11). Furthermore, the vices (21) can be uncoupled from the slide (11) and can also be opened individually, so that cut-off profile segments can be individually separated and the workpiece (4) can be machined at intended locations.

A transport and holding device (1) for bar-shaped workpieces (4), in particular 
for tubular sections, which can be fed into a machining centre (2) and are to 

be machined therein, having a movable slide (11) on a fixed carrier rail (10) 
and a plurality of vices (21) arranged movably on the carrier rail that hold the 

workpiece (4) by means of chuck jaws (22, 23) which can be moved towards 
the workpiece, and having actuating devices (31, 41, 51) for opening the 

chuck jaws (22, 23) as well as for releasing the connection between the slide 
(11) and the vices (21),
characterised in that,
 
the actuating devices (31, 41, 51) are arranged on the side adjacent to the 

carrier rail (10).  
 
The transport and holding device in accordance with claim 1,
characterised in that,
 
the slide (11) is equipped with a guide rail (12) which has wedge-shaped 

surfaces (13) and the vices (21) can be locked against the guide rail (12) by 
means of clamping pieces (26, 27). 
The transport and holding device in accordance with claim 2,
characterised in that,
 
a collet (52) is provided in order to release the clamped connection, the collet 

(52) being actuated by means of a hydraulic fluid, acting on the chuck jaws 
(27) in the form of a servo device (51) and being arranged at the side of the 

carrier rail (11) with its axis perpendicular thereto. 
The transport and holding device in accordance with one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,
 
each of the vices (21) consists of a fixed chuck jaw (22) and an adjustable 

chuck jaw (23) which can be moved along an axis perpendicular to the slide 
by means of the force of a spring (29). 
The transport and holding device in accordance with claim 4,
characterised in that,
  
 

the adjustable chuck jaws (23) of the vices (21) can be actuated individually 
and/or jointly against the force of the spring (29) by servo devices (31, 41) 

which can be pressurised by a hydraulic fluid. 
The transport and holding device in accordance with one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that,
 
one collet (52) and one servo device (41) for actuating the adjustable chuck 

jaws of the vices (21) are arranged, in a preferred embodiment, opposite one 

another within the machining centre (2). 
The transport and holding device in accordance with one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that,
 
two or more collets (52) are arranged laterally at intervals and, in a preferred 

embodiment, in an adjustable manner on the side next to the carrier rail (10). 
The transport and holding device in accordance with one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that,
  
 

a servo device (31) is provided outside the machining centre (2) and arranged 
adjacent to the carrier rail (10) in order to insert a workpiece (4) into the vices 

(21) arranged on the slide (11), with the servo device (31) enabling the vices 
(21) to be actuated jointly.
