<DESCRIPTION>
 4-Am1no-3-acyl quinol lne derivatives and thei r use as I nhibitors of gastr add secretion .Field of use of the invention5 - The invention relates to new quinoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, their use and medicaments containing them. The compounds according to the invention are used in the pharmaceutical industry for the preparation of medicaments.Known technical background104-Amino-3-acyl-quinoline derivatives and their use as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion are described in European Patent Application EP-A-330 485.Description of the invention15It has now been found that the compounds which are described below in more detail and which differ from the compounds of the prior art in particular by the substituent in the 8-position of the quinoline ring have surprising and particularly advantageous properties.20The invention thus relates in a first aspect to compounds of the formula I:25 (I)A whereinR! denotes hydrogen, hydroxyl (OH), halogen or C^alkyl, R.2 denotes hydrogen or Cj^alkyl, 30 R3 denotes Cι_4alkyl, 

 A denotes methylene (-CH2-), ethylene (-CH2CH2-), ethylidene [-CH(CH3)-], trimethylene (-CH2CH2CH2-), oxyethylene (-O-CH2CH2-) or oxytrimethylene (-O-CH2CH2CH2-),X denotes Cj_6alkylene or C2-4alkenylene and ■ Y denotes hydroxyl (OH) or amino (NH2), and their salts.Halogen in the sense of the present invention is bromine, chlorine and in particular fluorine.Cι_4alkyl represents straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples which may be mentioned are the butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert- butyl, propyl, isopropyl, ethyl and the methyl radical. The C^alkyl radicals R* and/or R^ are preferably methyl radicals. Preferred C^alkyl radicals R3 are the ethyl, the isopropyl and in particular the propyl radical.Ci.galkylene represents straight-chain or branched alkylene radicals having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples which may be mentioned are the methylene (-CH2-), ethylene (-CH2CH2-), ethylidene [-CH(CH3)-J, isopropylidene [-CH(CH3)2-], propylidene [-CH(C2H5)-], trimethylene (-CH2CH2CH2-), propylene [-CH(CH3)-CH2-], tetramethylene (-CH2CH2CH2CH2-), 1,1-dimethylethylene [-C(CH3)2-CH2-], 1,2- dimethylethylene [-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-], 1-methyltrimethylene [-CH(CH3)-CH2CH2-], 2-methyItrimethylene [-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-], pentylidene [-CH(C4H9)-], pentan-3- ylidene [-CH C2H5)2-], pentamethylene (-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-), and the hexamethylene radical (-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-), of which the ethylene radical is preferred.C2-4alkenylene represents straight-chain or branched,
