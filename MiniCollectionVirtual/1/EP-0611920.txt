<ABSTRACT>
The gas-fired furnace is formed from three separable parts comprising a base (5), a burner head (7) and a removable support grate (16) fixed onto a base (5) which is immobilised on the cooking surface forming, with the head (7), the body of the burner. In this three-part gas-fired furnace, there is a gap (15) between the underside of the head (7) of the burner and a lower peripheral facing rim situated on the base (5) or on the removable support grate (16) for the passage of the combustible gaseous mixture with a view to producing and maintaining the pilot flame. This invention is of interest to designers of gas cooking tops or cookers.

<CLAIMS>
Gas burner for a gas hob or cooker mounted on a 
hob (1) with a bent pipe (3) supplying the gas burner at 

its centre and conveying the burnable gas mixture to the 
burner, comprising three detachable mechanical parts 

assembled coaxially resting freely on or fitting in one 
another, these mechanical parts consisting of a ring-shaped 

base (5), a burner head (7) with a cap (6) and a 
support grid (16) with a ring-shaped central part (18) 

comprising an upper edge delimiting the opening in the 
central part (18) which is circular and from which there 

extend branches (17), the ends of which constitute the 
supports on which the cooking vessels rest, the bent 

supply pipe (3) emerging inside the base (5), characterized 
in that the bent pipe (3) has a collar (34) situated 

underneath the hob (1), in that the gas burner further 
comprises a quick-fit connection piece (33) situated 

above the base (5) and interacting with the bent pipe (3) 
and in that the quick-fit connection piece (33) connects 

the bent pipe (3), the hob (1) and the base (5) together. 
Burner according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the head (7) and the support grid (16) can move and 

be detached from one another and from the base (5). 
Burner according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the central part (18) of the support grid (16) is 

mounted on and surrounds the foot of the base (5). 
Burner according to Claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the base (5) has a coaxial hollow cylindrical 

portion (9) ending in a planar annular front face 
(10) and an outer peripheral shoulder. 
Burner according to Claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized  
 

in that the base (5) has the overall shape of a flat 
circle with a tapering shoulder (26) on its outer periphery, 

against which the central part (18) of the support 
grid (16) rests. 
Burner according to Claims 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the outer peripheral shoulder of the base (5) is 

a double peripheral shoulder. 
Burner according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the central part (18) of 

the grid has an internal profile (19) that complements 
that of the outer peripheral shoulder of the base (5). 
Burner according to Claims 1, 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the upper edge of the central part (18) of 

the grid has at its upper edge an upper peripheral rim 
(29) with a planar front upper surface (30) lying facing 

the peripheral shoulder (13) on the underside (14) of the 
burner head. 
Burner according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the outer lateral surface of the support grid (16) 

has the overall shape of a tapering ramp (32) with a 
steep slope ending in the upper rim (29) with a step (31) 

set back towards the inside. 
Burner according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the head (7) is extended 

downwards in the form of a lower cylindrical projection 
(12) that has a smaller diameter than the cap (6), and 

the start of which delimits the shoulder (13) surrounded 
by a planar border (14) from which there emerge thickened 

portions which act as spacers making it possible to form 
a gap (15) between it and a peripheral rim opposite 

beneath the ring of slots in the burner head, the gap 
being designed for creating the pilot flame(s) or 

catching the main flame. 
Burner according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the peripheral rim opposite is the planar annular 

front face (10) of the portion (9) of the base (5). 
Burner according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the peripheral rim opposite is the upper peripheral 

rim (29) of the central part (18) of the support grid  
 

(16). 
Burner according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each of the branches (17) is formed of an upper part 

(21) and of a horizontal leg (20) connecting it tangentially 
to the central part (18). 
Burner according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the horizontal legs (20) of the branches (17) are 

curved and start off at a tangent to the ring-shaped 
central part (18). 
Burner according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the quick-fit connection piece (33) is of the 

bayonet type.
