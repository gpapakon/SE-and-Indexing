<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of outputting
results of facsimile communication in a facsimile
apparatus capable of outputting a communication report,
as well as to the facsimile apparatus.A facsimile apparatus is available in which a
communication-error report or a report of communication
results is outputted as a report accompanied by an
image, namely a report in which a communication image is
added to the part of a report that indicates the
communication date and the communicating party. The
reason for such an arrangement is that such an apparatus
has the following advantages:
(a) When a plurality of transmissions are made to
the same party in the memory transmission mode and the
results of communication in a certain transmission among
these transmissions indicate an error, it is easy to
determine which transmission of a document gave the
error results.(b) By outputting a report irrespective of the
communication results in the memory transmission mode,
the report serves as proof indicating whether or not the 
transmission of a required document was made with
certainty.In a case where the report is accompanied by an
image, only image data in an amount capable of following
the report text is outputted in a form appended to the
report. Consequently, if the report text is added to an
A4 image, for example, and the result is printed out on
A4 paper, a portion of the image equivalent to the size
of the report will be left out. An example in which
part of the communication data has thus been lost is
illustrated in Fig. 9(A). In Fig. 9, the image that
results owing to omission of the lower one-third of the
image illustrated in Fig. 9(B) is added to the report.The omission of the image portion not only results
in an unattractive appearance but also detracts greatly
from the merits of a report accompanied by an image. If
a distinctive portion of the image happens to be
omitted, there is the possibility that even the report
accompanied by the image will be rendered meaningless.In order to avoid this problem, it has been
contemplated to output the report by dividing it into
two or more pages. However, this is impractical since
it is wasteful of recording paper and results in the
report being scattered over several pages.Further, an arrangement is conceivable in which a
report accompanied by an image is printed out on 
recording paper having a size greater than that of the
image size. However, this also is wasteful of recording
paper. In addition, if the report is larger than the
maximum size of the recording
