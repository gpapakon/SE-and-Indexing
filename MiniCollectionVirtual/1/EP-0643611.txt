<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the biofiltration of gases, specifically, to a packing material comprising a calcareous material of aquatic origin and to a biofilter bed (10) containing a calcareous material of aquatic origin as the packing material (20). The calcareous material may be derived from a marine alga or a marine calcareous sand and, preferably, the calcareous material is derived from Lithothamnium calcareum. The packing material (20) may consist essentially of calcareous material derived from Lithothamnium calcareum (20a) or, alternatively, the packing material may comprise calcareous material derived from Lithothamnium calcareum in admixture with a known packing material selected from peat, compost, wood chips, heather or coir (20b). The packing material (20) and biofilter bed (10) according to the invention may be used for cleaning gaseous effluents from industrial, municipal and agricultural plants.

 BIOFILTRATION OF GASES
 The present invention relates to the biofiltration of gases, specifically, to a packing material for biofiltration of a gas and to a biofilter bed. The assembly of a packing material and one or more strains of micro-organism(s), if present, when located in a housing, is termed a biofilter bed.


 Biofiltration involves the removal of components from the gas being treated by the dual action of filtration/adsorption onto the packing material and decomposition by the micro-organisms, primarily bacteria and fungi, which are present in or on the packing material. The components to be removed from the gas are usually adsorbed onto or into the packing material and are then decomposed by the micro-organisms present in a bio-layer in or on the packing material. Thorough contact of the gas and its components with the bio-layer is necessary.


 In recent years biofiltration has been increasingly used for cleaning gases such as effluents from industrial and agricultural plants e.g. furnaces, abattoirs and rendering, food processing, pharmaceutical and chemical plants, and sewage works. Known packing materials in such biofilter beds are compost, fibrous peat (Eriophorum or peat fibre), nodular peat, wood chips, heather and coir (coconut fibre).


 Suitable packing materials should act as a carrier for the micro-organisms(s), if present, and as a humidity reservoir and should also provide adsorption surfaces for the gas to be filtered. Factors which influence the biofilter bed's efficiency include  contaminant solubility; bed pH; bed humidity; efficiency of contact between the gas and the micro-organism(s); rate of reaction between the contaminants in the gas and the micro-organism(s); flow rate of the gas through the biofilter bed; back pressure (flow resistance); and the porosity and height of the biofilter bed.


 Problems are often encountered with known packing materials, due partly to their relative lack of homogeneity. The natural structure of known packing materials, which typically consist of loose, low density materials, often prevents a uniform distribution of gas flow, as a result of which the biofilter bed cracks and short-circuiting channels develop in the packing material. This causes a considerable drop in the biofilter bed's effectiveness. Reducing irregularities in the packing material by the inclusion of light uniform non-degradable materials such as polystyrene reduces the risk of bed cracking. However, the inclusion of non-natural materials such as polystyrene in the
