<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transparent imaging sheet for 
use in electrostatic imaging machines. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to an imaging manifold comprising a 
transparent sheet and an opaque member adhered thereto by means of 
a removable pressure sensitive adhesive. Transparencies for the projection of light images are well 
known and can be formed from a transparent film base and an image 
or print applied thereto by an electrostatic copying process. 
Electrostatic copying machines are well known and generally employ 
sophisticated mechanisms allowing them to select imaging sheets 
from a stack of sheets and by the use of rollers, wheels, belts, 
and the like, to cause such sheets to rapidly and precisely be 
moved past various points in the machine during the imaging 
process, producing a great number of copies in a relatively short 
time span. Such sophisticated mechanisms include sensing devices 
to prevent damage to the machine if wrinkling, tearing or other 
deformation of the sheets occurs. For example, these sensing 
devices will halt operation of the machine if jamming occurs so as 
to avoid damage. Many of these sensing mechanisms employ 
photosensors which monitor the passage of the sheet through the 
machine. In order for such sensing mechanisms to function, the 
sheets need to be opaque in certain areas so as to interrupt the 
light beams employed in the photosensing mechanisms. Accordingly, 
when transparent sheet materials are used in these copying 
machines, they need to be rendered opaque in selected areas to 
operate properly in the copier. Some copying machines require that only a small portion of 
the transparent sheet be rendered opaque and therefore the 
printing of a dark line along the top or side of such sheets is 
sufficient. Other machines require that a greater area of the 
sheet be rendered opaque or that prime image areas of the sheet be 
opaque. Obviously, this situation precludes the use of a 
transparent sheet with an unobtrusive opaque line printed along 
one edge. One method of rendering a sheet opaque is by making imaging 
manifolds which comprise a transparent sheet and an opaque backing 
member generally adhered thereto by means of an adhesive. U.S. 
3,618,752 discloses a stack of image receiving members, each being 
in contact with adjacent members. Each image members includes a  
 
generally rectangular, transparent, non-fibrous, flexible sheet, 
and a sheet of paper backing, substantially coextensive and in 
register with the
