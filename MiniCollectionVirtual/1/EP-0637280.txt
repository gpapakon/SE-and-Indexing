<ABSTRACT>
Methods for bonding metallic structures to thermoplastic and thermoset composite structures are described. The methods include steps for preparing the metallic structure (14) for bonding by knurling a mating surface of the metallic structure and molding a layer of thermoplastic material (50) over the knurled mating surface to produce a bonding surface. To bond a metallic structure (14) to a thermoplastic composite structures (16), the bonding surface of the metallic fitting is consolidated with the thermoplastic composite structure (50). To bond a metallic structure to a thermoset composite structure, a bonding surface is formed on the thermoset composite structure by partially embedding a layer of dry fibre reinforcement in a thermoplastic material layer, coating the exposed dry fiber reinforcement with thermoset resin, and curing the coating dry fiber reinforcement into the thermoset composite structure. The bonding surfaces of the thermoset composite structure and the metallic structure are then fused together by applying heat sufficient to melt the thermoplastic material layers of the bonding surfaces. A resistance heating element (54) is disposed between the bonding surfaces of the thermoset composite structure (16) and the metallic structure to provide the heat required to melt the thermoplastic material layers of the bonding surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of bonding thermoplastic and 
thermoset composite structures to metallic structures, and more particularly to 
a composite to metal bond that will transmit axial and torsional loads between 
the metallic structure and the composite structure. Thermoplastic and thermoset composite materials have received 
widespread use as structural elements. Such composite materials produce 
lightweight structures having relatively high strength characteristics. In 
addition, thermoplastic composite materials have the characteristic of being 
reshapeable because they can be repeatedly heated to the melting temperature 
of the material. In the aircraft industry, the use of thermoplastic and 
thermoset composite materials can produce significant weight savings and 
provide ease of replacement and repair. While the uses for structural elements made from thermoplastic and 
thermoset composite materials are expanding, some applications still require 
metallic structural members. One such application is the splined connection 
of a rotor shaft to a gas turbine engine of a helicopter. The splined 
connection fits within a complementary shaped recess and transfers rotational 
forces from the gas turbine engine to the shaft. Metallic splined connectors 
are preferred due  
 
to the difficulties in forming a composite splined 
shaft connector having sufficient strength to withstand 
the engine loads. In such applications, however, the 
shaft itself could be made from a thermoplastic or 
thermoset composite material which has a metallic 
fitting affixed thereto. The metallic fitting would 
connect the shaft to the engine. A problem in mating thermoplastic or thermoset 
composite shafts with metallic fittings is the 
attachment between the fitting and the shaft. This 
attachment is required to transfer operational loads, 
both torsional and axial, between the two elements. 
Thermoplastic and thermoset composite materials do not 
fuse with metallic materials with sufficient strength 
to withstand operational loads. In addition, cured 
thermoset composite materials cannot be reheated to 
reverse the bond between the fitting and the shaft. 
Standard adhesives do not provide a bond of sufficient 
strength to withstand the torsional and axial loads 
that are transmitted from the fitting to the shaft. One solution in the prior art is to mechanically 
connect the metallic fitting to the composite shaft. 
A connection of this type may use pins and/or flanges 
adapted to be bolted together. The pinned
