<ABSTRACT>
Chrome-plating of calcium carbonate-filled polypropylene proceeds at a higher

segmented copolymer of polypropylene// poly (methyl methacrylate).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with plating CaCO₃-filled polypropylene and to 
plated articles so produced. Polypropylene is a low-cost, easily-moldable thermoplastic which would be a 
useful substrate for chrome-plating for decorative objects such as automobile parts, like 
knob handles, dashboard accessories and fascia, sanitary ware, appliances, household 
objects, such as decorative perfume bottle caps, knob handles and drape-pull handles. 
The current market is served by the more expensive matrix ABS (acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene). ABS is plated by a complicated process which varies somewhat from producer to 
producer, but essentially involves an oxidative chemical reaction, such as with chromic 
acid, which probably occurs at the double bonds of the polybutadiene portion of the 
ABS. This first step is commonly known as "etching" and is the most critical portion of 
the process for assurance of a non-peeling coating. The etched sites created there can then be electroplated with a thin layer of a 
metal like palladium, and then chromium-plating applied by a non-electrolytic process. 
(In other variants, the intermediate and final metallic layers may also be added by an 
electrolytic process; the improvement in plating of the present invention is independent 
of the actual plating process.) The process is well described in Encyclopaedia of 
Polymer Engineering and Science, 2nd edition, Vol. 9, pp. 580-9, in J.M. Margolis, 
"Decorating Plastics, Chapter 2, ed. Margolis, Hanser Publishers, 1986, and (for earlier 
patent art), J. McDermott, ed. "Plating of Plastics with Metals", Noyes Data, 1974. The above process is not used with conventional polypropylene molded articles 
because the initial step of surface treatment occurs at so slow a rate as to be impractical, 
and the adhesion of the metallic layers is poor. Blends of finely dispersed CaCO₃ have 
been employed to improve adhesion to the polypropylene, but the rate of achieving 
acceptable bonding is so slow that the CaCO₃- modified polypropylene cannot replace 
ABS on the commercial high-speed production lines. Carbon-black filled 
polypropylene has also been employed. Kolarik et al, Polymer, 33,4961 (1992) discusses the effect of ethylene-propylene 
rubber functionalized with a small percentage of grafted maleic anhydride or acrylic 
acid in obtaining improved matrix-filler interaction between CaCO₃ filler and 
polypropylene, but no mention is made of chrome-plating of such composites. In the study of blends of polyolefins with graft copolymers

<CLAIMS>
A process for metal-plating a blend of polypropylene with from 10 to 35 
weight %, based on the total blend, of finely-divided CaCO₃ which comprises 


(a) molding the polypropylene/ CaCO₃ blend into an object to be metal-plated; 
(b) contacting the molded object with an oxidizing bath; 
(c) further contacting the molded object with a metal deposition bath, to form 
a metal film on the molded object, 
 
characterised in that there is added to the blend, prior to molding, from 20 to 35 

weight % of segmented copolymer comprising polypropylene trunk of weight average 
molecular weight between 50,000 and 1,000,000 bearing at least one methacrylate chain 

grafted with a covalent bond to said trunk, the weight ratio of grafted chain to trunk 
between from 1:9 to 4:1, said chain being polymer derived from at least about 80% of 

methyl methacrylate. 
A process of Claim 1 wherein the metal is chromium, nickel, or copper. 
A process of Claim 1 / 2 wherein the grafted chain or chains has a weight 
average molecular weight of from 20,000 to 200,000. 
A process of Claim 1, 2, or 3 wherein the weight ratio of grafted chain to grafted 
trunk is between 1:9 to 1:1. 
A process of any preceding Claim wherein the segmented copolymer contains 
about 63% polypropylene having a weight-average molecular weight of about 305,000 

and about 37 % of chains of methyl methacrylate/ butyl acrylate 95:5 (by weight) 
copolymer. 
A process of any preceding claim, wherein the blend further contains from 15 to 
25 weight percent of barium sulfate. 
Metal-plated articles prepared by a process of any preceding Claim. 
Chromium-plated articles prepared by a process of any of Claims 1 to 6. 
Chromium-plated articles as claimed in Claim 8 in the form of a cap or closure 
for a container.
