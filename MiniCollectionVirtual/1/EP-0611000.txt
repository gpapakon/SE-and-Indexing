<ABSTRACT>
A tooth wheel (33) intended to co-act with a transmission 
member with transmission elements (19,20), which tooth wheel (33) 

bears a 
number of protrusions (34) arranged on the periphery which are 

each provided with at least one contact surface (26,27) for co-action 
with the transmission elements (19,20), comprising self-adjusting 

adjusting means for adjusting the pitch of the contact 
surfaces (26,27), wherein each protrusion (34) can swivel substantially 

in 
the main plane of the tooth wheel (33) round at least one centre (36,37) 

outside the connecting line between the centre line of the 
tooth wheel (33) and the zone of engagement between the contact 

surface (26,27) and a transmission element (19,20). 
It is an object of the invention to embody a tooth 
wheel (33) such that the distribution of the forces over the 

protrusions (34) is better in the case of individual variations of 
the relevant pitch distances. 
With a view to this object the tooth wheel (33) according to 
the invention has the feature that during a swivelling of the 

relevant protrusion (34) the contact surface (26,27) of the transmission 
element (19,20) co-acting therewith undergoes a substantial radial 

displacement in relation to the tooth wheel (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device having a toothed wheel 
to co-act with a transmission member with transmission 
elements, for instance a chain with links or a toothed 
belt as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and 2 respectively 
which is known from US-A 1 633 746. A similar device is known from DE-C 165 920 in which the 
toothed wheel comprises a separate carrier which bears 
a number of protrusions arranged on the periphery, which 
protrusions are each provided with one contact surface 
for co-action with the transmission elements, comprising 
self-adjusting adjusting means for adjusting the pitch 
of the contact surfaces, wherein each protrusion can 
swivel substantially in the main plane of the tooth 
wheel round at least one centre outside the connecting 
line between the centre line of the tooth wheel and the 
zone of engagement between the contact surface and a 
transmission element. In relation to this prior art it is an object of the invention 
to embody a self-adjusting tooth wheel such that 
the distribution of the forces over the protrusions is 
better in the case of individual variations of the relevant 
pitch distances. With a view to this object the device according to the 
invention has the features as defined in claim 1 and 2 
respectively. Preferred embodiments including also toothed wheels and 
protrusions forming part of the toothed wheels are defined 
in the appended claims.  
 In order to be certain that the protrusions are situated 
in the suitable position prior to engagement with the 
transmission elements, use can advantageously be made of 
resetting spring means which urge the contact surfaces to an 
extreme rest position. It is noted that the dimensioning of 
the device must be such that at the beginning of the 
engagement with the transmission elements the contact 
surfaces can indeed come into contact with these elements. The use of resetting spring means can be dispensed with 
under particular conditions, for instance in the case where, 
in the free, i.e. non-loaded situation of the protrusions, 
the latter are situated on the underside of a vertically 
disposed tooth wheel. It must then be ensured however that 
the force of gravity is sufficient to tilt the protrusions to 
the desired position while overcoming the associated friction 
forces. The invention also relates to a toothed wheel and a protrusion intended to 
serve as component of a device as specified above. This 
protrusion and toothed wheel is characterized by the features of claims 6 to 9. The invention
