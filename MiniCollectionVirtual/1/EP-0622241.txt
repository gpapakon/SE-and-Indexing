<ABSTRACT>
A carriage support system for a computer driven 
printer/plotter employs a slider rod (6) and a slider bar (8) mounted 

parallel to each other on a printer chassis (4) wherein the bar 
supports the front side of a printer carriage (10) and the rod 

supports the rear side of the carriage thus eliminating expensive 
centerless ground carriage support rods. The slider bar also has 

a plurality of dual edge paper pinch wheels (100) supported thereon 
which are biased into engagement with the paper or other medium 

on which printing takes place by a plurality of springs (112) 
integrally formed from a single member affixed to the slider bar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carriage support 
system for a computer driven printer/plotter carriage which 
slides back and forth transversely of the path of paper travel 
through the printer/plotter on at least one smooth support rod 
which is ordinarily cylindrical. Printer/plotter carriages are typically supported on 
two sliding tracks such as two smooth centerless ground steel 
rods which are expensive to manufacture to the close tolerances 
required for high resolution high speed printing. A carriage 
support system which can be manufactured to and retain close 
tolerances without the attendant expense of a plurality of 
centerless ground steel support rods is therefore required for 
printer/plotter carriages which must move without impediment at 
a high rate of speed with frequent reversals in the direction of 
movement along the slider rods. In U.S. Patent No. 4,755,836 
issued to Taj, et al on July 5, 1988 and assigned to the assignee 
of the present invention, a single slider rod relatively closely 
positioned on one side of the printer carriage is used in 
combination with a guide track positioned relatively far from the 
printer carriage on the other side thereof. U.S. Patent No.  
 
4,872,026 issued on October 3, 1989 and 4,843,338 issued June 27, 
1989, to Rassmussen, et al and assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention each use a slider rod and guide track 
positioned on the same side of the carriage. Carriage support systems have ordinarily been 
manufactured separate and apart from the paper or other print 
media feed system which uses a plurality of separate paper pinch 
wheels such as star wheels or grit wheels which are individually 
biased toward a paper feed roller or belt. A carriage support 
system which also supports the pinch wheels enables the 
elimination of excessive parts subject to malfunction or 
breakage. The EP-A-0 430 565 discloses a print head mounting 
arrangement for a wire dot printer, having a movable print 
head carriage including: a mounting plate; a horizontally 
extending slider rod; and a horizontally extending slider bar 
parallel to and spaced from the slider rod; the slider rod and 
the slider bar each being fixed to a chassis, the slider bar 
having a carriage support surface, the slider rod being 
engageable with one side of the carriage and the slider bar 
being engageable with an opposite side of the carriage. Also 
in the printhead mounting arrangement of this document the 
carriage support system is manufactured separate and apart 
from
