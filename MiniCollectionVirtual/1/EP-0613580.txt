<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a method and an arrangement relating to visual display units, preferably a picture tube (1), for reducing to a minimum the electrical alternating fields generated by the display unit in the unit surroundings. The visual display unit is provided with a voltage connected part (5) on which undesirable voltage variations occur. These voltage variations are indicated. A signal which is phase inverted in relation to the indicated voltage variations is generated. The generated phase-inverted signal is fed back to the voltage connected part (5), to compensate for the voltage variations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement of the 
kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1. The hazards of working in front of video display units 
have been discussed in the 1980s. As a result of these 
discussions, it is now a standard requirement that 
emissions of various kinds, such as magnetic fields, 
electrical fields, etc., shall be held at the lowest 
possible level. The discussions have resulted in methods for voluntarily 
testing video screens. As from 1987, there has 
been a strong commercial demand to fulfil certain 
recommended measurement values in conjunction with the 
recommended measuring method. In certain instances, it 
is necessary to fulfil still more stringent, customer-specific 
requirements. The ability to show comparatively 
low measurement values in these voluntary tests 
has given a competitive edge to retailers. The revised 
methods for voluntarily testing video display units 
have included testing for electrical alternating 
fields. These fields are often measured in two frequency 
bands, band I (5Hz-2kHz) and band II (2kHz-400kHz). The electrical alternating fields deriving from a 
video display unit, primarily a CRT-type unit (cathode 
ray tube-unit) are generated by a number of different 
electrical components included in the unit. It is a 
relatively easy matter to screen the electrical alternating 
fields in all directions with the exception of  
 
the forward direction immediately in front of the 
screen, for instance with the aid of screening plates, 
electrically conductive outer casings or housings, or 
with the aid of electrically conductive layers or 
coatings on a plastic outer casing. The electrical 
alternating field extending forwardly from the screen 
surface of a CRT-type video display unit is caused by 
variations in the acceleration voltage applied inwardly 
of the front glass of the video display unit. One method of dealing with the effect of, among other 
things, the electrical alternating fields that are 
generated in front of a display screen involves the 
use of a transformer in the high voltage part with low 
internal impedance, although this solution is expensive 
if the result is to be effective. Another method 
involves coupling an external capacitor across the 
acceleration voltage. Although this solution will 
smooth the acceleration voltage, particularly at the 
low frequencies that fall within band I, it has been 
found that the solution is not effective enough to 
provide satisfactory equalization of the more high-frequency 
voltage
