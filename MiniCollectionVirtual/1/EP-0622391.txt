<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to resins to be employed
as coating, in particular to polyesters (PE).More particularly, the polyesters of the invention contain
fluorinated blocks.The fluorinated polymers are known for their good mechanical
properties and their chemical resistance, water repellency
and resistance to UV radiations. However, their insolubility
in the solvents normally used in varnishes makes
them unusable for certain applications, for instance in the
preparation of paints and varnishes.It is known, from the other hand, that the use of
hydrogenated polyester resins allows to obtain coatings
showwing very good mechanical properties; however, they show
a poor chemical resistance, resistance to solvents and to UV
radiations.Elastomeric wholly fluorinated PE, as for instance the
ones of US Patent 3810874, are known. These polymers, however,
cannot be utilized as coatings as they are insoluble
in the usual solvents utilized for coatings in the case of
the corresponding hydrogenated polyesters. Even if one concedes 
to find out a solvent, these polyesters are not utilizable
as coating, as they have poor adhesion to the
support and moreover poor mechanical properties, for instance
poor hardness.Even conceding to crosslink these polyesters, they show
a very low crosslinking density, therefore it is not possible
to considerably increase their mechanical properties by
crosslinking.Polyesters from PFPE with hydrogenated blocks are also
known, they however show all the drawbacks indicated for
polyesters from perfluoropolyether of the above indicated US
Patent.Moreover the Applicant has experimentally found that
the fluorinated part in these polyesters is confined in particular
fields, so modifying the material from the optical
point of view. Non trasparent polymers are in fact obtained.
If the PFPE content is high with respect to the hydrogenated
content, the hydrogenated part is confined. Therefore
the transparence disappears, so that these polyesters are
not suitable in the varnishes field also when it is desired
to pigment them.
Furthermore, as said above, they show solubility problems
due to the different nature of the components. They are not
soluble in the usual solvents, for instance in xylene commonly 
utilized in varnishes.It is known to utilize also other types of fluorinated
polymers as coating, for instance the polymer from vinylydenefluoride
(VDF) with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and/or
perfluoropropene (HFP); however the mechanical properties of
these polymers are poor and they can be
