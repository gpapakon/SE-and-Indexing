of the present invention is suitable for producing a member,
for example a vane wheel or a diffuser of a fluidal machine,
for example a pump, a compressor, a blowing machine or the
like. DE 28 08 106 A1 discloses a method for producing a joint
between a first member and a second member, comprising the
steps of making a first member and a second member contact
an insert member whose melting temperature is lower than
melting temperatures of the first and second members, heating
the insert member to a welding temperature which is

of the insert member and at least an original base
component of the second member different from the original
base component of the insert member are caused by the heating,

least until the original base component of the insert member
is replaced by at least one of the original base components
of the first member and the second member and at least one
of the original base components of the first member and the
second member becomes a substitute base component of the
insert member.FR-A-1 195 124 discloses a vane member comprising a first
member and a second member which are joint together in a
similar way as described in DE 28 08 106 A1, using an interlayer
comprising Ni.US 3 678 570 discloses a diffusion bonding effected utilizing
a thin alloy interlayer which melts at the desired
diffusion bonding temperature forming a transient liquid
phase and which subsequently resolidifies at temperature as
result of constituent interdiffusion, continued heat treatment
providing a homogeneous solid-state diffusion bond. DE 33 39 751 A1
which is considered as closest prior art
discloses a joining method for producing one
single part by joining two or more members, said members
being produced from a highly form resistant metallic material,
specifically on the basis of Ni or iron. The members and
