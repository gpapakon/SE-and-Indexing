<ABSTRACT>
In a process of producing urea in which ammonia and 
carbon dioxide are reacted in a first reaction space (E-1, 

R-1) the unreacted carbamate present in the reaction 
mixture is subjected to a thermal decomposition 

treatment, so as to obtain ammonia and carbon dioxide 
which are sent to a second reaction space (R-2) in which 

they react with a solution of recycled carbamate coming 
from an urea recovery section (3). Advantageously, the 

regulation of the temperature and of the ammonia/carbon 
dioxide molar ratio in the second reaction space (R-2) is 

carried out by respectively regulating the temperature of 
the recycled carbamate solution and the temperature of 

the thermal decomposition treatment of the residual 
carbamate leaving the first reaction space (E-1, R-1).

<DESCRIPTION>
From a general point of view, the present invention 
refers to a process of producing urea. More particularly, the invention refers to a process of 
producing urea of the type comprising the steps of: 
reacting substantially pure ammonia and carbon dioxide 
in a first reaction space, so as to obtain a first 
reaction mixture including urea and carbamate; subjecting the first reaction mixture to a thermal 
decomposition treatment of the carbamate so as to obtain 
a flow of ammonia and carbon dioxide and an independent 
flow of urea, undecomposed carbamate and free ammonia in 
aqueous solution; feeding the ammonia and carbon dioxide flow to a second 
reaction space; feeding the flow of urea and undecomposed carbamate in 
a urea recovery section so as to obtain independent flows 
of urea, ammonia and carbamate; recycling the flow of carbamate so obtained to the 
second reaction space; reacting ammonia and carbon dioxide obtained from the 
thermal decomposition treatment and the recycled 
carbamate in the second reaction space, so as to obtain a 
second reaction mixture. The invention also refers to a plant for carrying out the 
above mentioned process. As is known, in urea production, the need is more and 
more felt of having on the one hand plants with higher 
capacity and operational flexibility and, on the other 
hand, lower investment and operating costs, especially in 
energetic terms. To this aim, various urea production processes have been 
proposed and reduced to practice in the art which are 
substantially based on conversion reactions carried out 
with different yields in reactors disposed in parallel 
one to the other, as described, for example, in European 
Patent Application EP-A-0 479 103. More particularly, such processes propose to carry out a 
first reaction in a primary high-yield reactor fed by 
substantially pure carbon dioxide and ammonia and 
optionally by highly pure recovered ammonia, as well as a 
second reaction in an auxiliary lower yield reactor, in 
parallel to the preceding one, fed by a solution 
(substantially comprising unreacted carbamate) coming 
from a urea recovery section. In a second known process, described for example in 
European Patent Application EP-A-0 544 056 by the same 
Applicant, the auxiliary lower yield reactor is fed not 
only by the solution coming from a urea recovery section, 
but also by ammonia and carbon dioxide obtained from a 
thermal decomposition treatment of the reaction mixture 
leaving the high-yield reactor. Even if these processes and in
