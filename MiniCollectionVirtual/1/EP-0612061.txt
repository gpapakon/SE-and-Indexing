<ABSTRACT>
A transducer assembly (10) has passive end 
regions (26) separated by a central active region (20). Layers of a first 

biasing material (14) and a nonmagnetic decoupling spacer material 
(16) are 

deposited on a substrate (12), then covered by a mask (18) only in the 
central region. By etching or ion milling, those parts of the layers not 

covered by the mask are removed to define a transverse biasing means in 
the central region and define the passive end regions. With the same 

mask remaining in place, a conductive material (22) and exchange layer 
(24) 

comprising a second biasing material are deposited over all regions. The 
mask is removed to define and provide conductor leads and longitudinal 

biasing means only in the end regions. MR material is thereafter 
deposited as a continuous thin film 

(28) in direct contact with the central 
region containing the transverse biasing means and in direct contact with 

the end regions containing the longitudinal biasing means. This 
fabrication technique has no critical etching steps requiring stopping at 

or near a particular interface and the MR film provides a continuous 
platform for carrying current without butted junctions in the current 

path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetoresistive (MR) read transducers
suitable for use in thin film magnetic heads for reading data from
magnetic storage devices, and the fabrication thereof.An MR read transducer requires an active region and passive
regions. The active region comprises suitable means for transversely
biasing the transducer, and each passive region comprises one of a pair
of conductor leads and generally suitable means for longitudinally
biasing the transducer.The most pertinent prior art known to applicants is
US Patent 4,771,349. This patent discloses (in Fig. 2) an MR read
transducer having passive end regions separated by a central active
region. A continuous thin film of MR material is first deposited over
both the central region and end regions. A nonmagnetic spacer layer and
a soft magnetic bias layer are deposited and are then patterned to cover
only the central active region for imparting a transverse bias to the
transducer. A longitudinal magnetic bias layer and conductive leads
extend over only the end regions of the transducer. This bias layer
creates an interfacial exchange interaction with the MR film that results
in an effective bias field that is oriented longitudinally for domain
suppression.While this transducer operates satisfactorily, it is relatively
difficult to fabricate for the following reason. It is made by applying
a mask or "stencil" over the soft magnetic layer and nonmagnetic spacer
layer and etching or ion milling to remove these layers outside the mask
to define the central region. The problem is that the MR film is
generally very thin (e.g., less than 200 Angstroms [20nm]) and it is
difficult to stop the etching or milling with a precision that is high
with respect to the thickness of the thin MR film. Failure to completely
remove the spacer layer in the end regions can render the transducer
inoperative; whereas if part of the thin MR film is inadvertently
removed, the consequent reduction in its thickness can undesirably impact
the sensing characteristics of the transducer. If an attempt is made to
restore the MR film to proper thickness by redeposition of MR material, 
it is difficult to determine how much to deposit because it is difficult
to determine in situ how much material was removed. This difficulty in
fabrication is also due in part to the fact that the film of MR material
is deposited on the substrate as the first step in the fabrication
process.US Patent 5,014,147 (in Fig. 4) discloses an MR transducer in which
a soft magnetic bias layer is
