<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a swing phase control device for an artificial knee joint prosthesis facilitating a natural sequence of movements and capable of reacting to abrupt movements. The swing phase control device consists of a piston and cylinder arrangement (2). There is a first chamber (8) on one side of the piston (12) and a second chamber (17) on the other. Both chambers can be interconnected via a first choke (38, 43). There is a second choke on the outlet side of the second chamber (17) which connects the latter to a fluid tank. The pressure in the second chamber (17) is applied to a control piston. It is designed in such a way that the second choke (32) closes when the pressure in the second chamber (17) reaches a predetermined level. Once the second choke (32) has closed, the elastic pressure in the second chamber (17) reinforces the return movement of the piston (12) in the cylinder, facilitating an abrupt stretching of the leg.

Swing phase control device (1) for an artificial knee joint
having a piston and cylinder arrangement (2) with a first chamber

(8) on one side of the piston (12) and a second chamber (17) on
the opposite side of the piston (12), which chambers are

interconnectable via an adjustable first throttle (38, 43)
arranged in the piston (12), the first chamber (8) being

connectable to a fluid reservoir, and there being provided a
second throttle (32), arranged on the outlet side of the second

chamber (17) facing away from the piston (12), for connecting the
second chamber (17) to the fluid reservoir, and a means which is

designed so that it closes the second throttle (32) if a
predetermined pressure is reached or exceeded in the second

chamber (17).
