<ABSTRACT>
A display apparatus comprises a display panel having a 
display picture area formed by scanning electrodes and data 

electrodes arranged in a matrix and drive means including 
first means for driving the scanning electrodes and second 

means for driving the data electrodes. When display data is 
non-changing image display data, control means controls the 

drive means so as to repeatedly scan for refreshing the 
non-changing image in an interlaced scanning mode wherein 

the scanning electrodes are scan-selected with shipping of 
one or more scanning lines apart in one vertical scanning 

and the picture area for displaying the non-changing image 
is rewritten in a plurality of the vertical scannings. When 

display data is changing image display data, the control 
means controls the drive means so as to selectively scan-select 

only a prescribed part of the changing image for 
rewriting in a non-interlaced scanning mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display
apparatus, particularly a ferroelectric liquid crystal
display apparatus suitable for moving display using a
cursor, mouse, etc.For a CRT (cathode ray tube) wherein an image
is formed by utilizing persistence on a fluorescent
screen and a TN-type LCD (twisted nematic-type liquid
crystal device) wherein an image is formed by utilizing
a transmittance change depending on an effective value
of driving voltage, it is necessary to use a
sufficiently high frame frequency which is a frequency
required for forming one picture based on their display
principle. The required frame frequency is generally
considered to be 30 Hz or higher. The frame frequency
is expressed as the reciprocal of the product of a
number of scanning lines and a horizontal scanning time
for scanning each scanning line. The scanning
processes or modes known at present include the
interlaced scanning process (with jumping of one or
more lines apart) and the non-interlaced scanning
process. Other practical scanning processes may
include the pairing process and a process comprising
simultaneous and parallel scanning of divided portions
of a picture screen, while the latter process is 
restricted to LCD. The NTSC standard system has
adopted an interlaced scanning process comprising a 2
fields/frame and a frame frequency of 30 Hz, wherein
the horizontal scanning time is about 63.5 µsec and
the number of scanning lines is about 480 (for
constituting effective display area). The TN-type LCD
has generally adopted a non-interlaced system including
200 - 400 scanning lines and a frame frequency of 30 Hz
or higher. Further, for CRT, there has been also
adapted a non-interlaced scanning system using a frame
frequency of 40 - 60 Hz and 200 - 1000 scanning lines.Now, it is assumed to drive a CRT or TN-type
LCD comprising 1920 (number of scanning lines) x 2560
pixels. In the case of an interlaced system using a
frame frequency of 30 Hz, the horizontal scanning time
is about 17.5 µsec and the horizontal dot clock
frequency is about 147 MHz (without consideration of
horizontal flyback for CRT). In the case of CRT, the
horizontal dot clock frequency of 147 MHz leads to a
very high beam scanning speed which exceeds by far
the maximum electron beam modulation frequency of a
beam gun used in picture tubes available at present, so
that accurate image formation cannot be effected even
by scanning at 17.5 µsec. In the case of TN-type LCD,
driving of 1920 scanning lines corresponds to a duty
factor of 1/1920 which is much

A display apparatus, comprising:

a) a memory-type display panel (11) having a picture area
formed by scanning electrodes (12C) and data electrodes

(13D) arranged in a matrix;
b) drive means (12, 13) including first means (12) for
driving the scanning electrodes and second means (13) for

driving the data electrodes;
c) control means (15) for:

in a period of non-rewriting a display picture on the
display panel when a demand of rewriting the display

picture does not occur,

controlling the first means to repeat an interlaced
scanning mode wherein a scanning selection signal is

sequentially applied to the scanning electrodes with
skipping of at least one scanning electrode apart in one

vertical scanning, and
controlling the second means to apply data signals not
changing the display picture, to refresh the display

picture, and

occurs during the non-rewriting period,
controlling the first means to intermit the interlaced
scanning mode and initiate a partial non-interlaced

scanning mode wherein a scanning selection signal is
applied to only a part of the scanning electrodes

corresponding to the part of the display picture without
skipping, and 
controlling the second means to apply data signals for
rewriting the part of the picture area to the data

electrodes, to effect a partial rewriting operation.

A display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein in
said interlaced scanning mode the scanning lines are scan-selected

vertical scanning so that mutually non-adjacent scanning 

electrodes are selected in at least two consecutive
vertical scannings.
