<ABSTRACT>
Partially formed products (2) are placed in molds (8) and a fluid such as air or an edible filler is injected into the partially formed products (2), e.g. by needles 17 [Fig. 6], so as to cause expansion and thereby produce final products (2) having the shape of the molds (8). Each mold (8) may comprise an upper mold part (14) and a lower mold part (11). The lower mold parts (11) may be mounted on a chain conveyor (9, 9b, 9c) [Fig. 1]
 or a rotating cylinder (28) [Fig. 12] so that the partially formed products (2) are moved towards and the final products (2) are moved away from a reciprocating assembly (12, 13) which carries the upper mold parts (14). Preferably, the final products (2) are retained in the upper mold parts (14) and then ejected by a blast of air. The invention enables complicated shapes to be formed at high production rates whilst using an economical amount of chocolate or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
manufacturing confectionery and similar products shaped,
at least on the external surface, according to a
preselected design. The invention also relates to a
machine for carrying out said process and to the shaped
final products.Confectionery products such as chewing gum and bubble gum
products, soft candies, toffees etcetera, are mass-produced
with very high outputs per hour. Methods to
produce them in symmetrical shapes, such
as spherical, cylindrical or ellipsoidal shapes, are known
in the art. On the contrary it is not possible to obtain
them with shapes reproducing fancy objects, nor is it
possible to obtain such products with their surface shaped
according to a selected design, i.e. with a plurality of
shaped lines and areas formed in high- or bas-relief. FR-A-2328407 discloses a process and an apparatus for
manufacturing candy products, in particular truffles
formed by a baked outer shell made of spongy food pastry
filled with an edible liquid filler. According to the
process disclosed in this French Patent Application, the
filling substance is injected into the outer shell and
then a partial vacuum is created inside the shell for
removing a portion of the previously injected filling
substance. For this purpose, it is also disclosed an
injection apparatus having a tank for the filling
substance, as well as syringe means connected to the tank
for pressurizing the filling substance and creating
subsequently a partial vacuum to remove at least part of
the substance. The resulting product holds however the
original shape of the outer shell.
Also shaped products, such as bubble gums according to the
preamble of claim 14, are generally known in the prior
art. The aim of the present invention is to solve the above
mentioned problem by providing a way of industrially
producing shaped confectionery products with a high output
per hour in a simple and economical way.Another aim of the present invention is to provide an
apparatus for carrying out the above referred to
industrial process. According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a process for
manufacturing confectionery products, comprising the
steps of: producing an intermediate product which is
plastically deformable and has a smaller size than a
desired final product; positioning said intermediate
product in a mold having a preselected shape;
connecting an interior portion of said intermediate
product to a source of pressurized fluid; feeding said
pressurized fluid into said

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing confectionery products,
comprising the steps of:


producing an intermediate product (2) which is
plastically deformable and has a smaller size than a

desired final product;
positioning said intermediate product (2) in a mold
(11, 14) having a preselected shape;
connecting an interior portion of said intermediate
product (2) to a source of a pressurized fluid;
feeding said pressurized fluid into said intermediate
product interior portion to conform said intermediate

product (2) to said preselected shape of said mold (11,
14) to produce said final product;
disconnecting said final product from said fluid
source; and
extracting said final product from said mold (11,
14).
A process according to claim 1, further comprising the
steps of:


positioning said intermediate product (2) in a lower
mold part (11) at a first position;
moving said intermediate product (2) and said lower
mold part (11) to a second position at which an upper mold

part (14) is located; 
closing together said upper and lower mold parts and
producing said final product; and
returning said lower mold part (11) to said first
position.
A process according to claim 2, wherein said final
product is temporarily secured to said upper mold part

(14) after being produced.
A process according to claim 2, wherein said lower mold
part (11) is moved between said first and second positions

by a chain conveyor (9, 9b, 9c).
A process according to claim 2, wherein said lower mold
part (11) is moved between said first position and second

position by a rotating cylinder (28).
A process according to any previous claim, wherein said
intermediate product (2) has a hollow interior, and said

pressurized fluid is air and/or a viscous edible fillers.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein said final product is a bubble gum, and said

process further comprises the step of sugar coating said
final product.
Apparatus for producing shaped confectionery products,
comprising:


a plurality of upper and lower mold parts (11, 14);

products (2) in said mold parts (11, 14); 
fluid feeding means (16-18, 21) for feeding
pressurized fluid into an inner portion of each

intermediate product (2) to produce said shaped products;
and
extractor means (23, 31, 32) for removing said shaped
products from said mold parts.
Apparatus according to claim 8, wherein said lower mold
parts (11) are movable between a first position where said

positioning means (5) are located and a second position
where said upper mold parts (14) are located, said upper

mold parts being reciprocatable between open mold
positions and closed mold positions in contact with said

lower mold parts (11).
Apparatus according to claim 8 or 9, further
comprising holding means (24, 25, 27) for temporarily

retaining said shaped products (2) in said upper or lower
