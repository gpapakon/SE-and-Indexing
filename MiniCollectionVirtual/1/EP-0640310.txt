<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steam convection oven (10) for food preparation, having an oven chamber (12) and an adjoining space (20) which is separated off from the latter and in which are arranged a motor-driven, radially acting fan (26) and a plurality of heating elements (38) surrounding the latter, a pre-atomizing element (34) for water guided, as desired, onto the latter from a conduit (36) being arranged on the hub (30) of the fan and rotating with the latter. To enable as good a pre-atomization as possible, the pre-atomizing element is arranged on the hub of the fan as a separate body having a convex surface.

Convection and steam oven (10) for foodstuffs,
with an oven space (12) and a secondary space (20)

which is divided off from the latter and in which are
arranged a motor-operated radially acting fan (26) and

a plurality of heating elements (38) surrounding the
latter, there being arranged on the hub (30) of the fan

(26) a pre-atomizing element (34), rotating with the
latter, for water which is selectively guided out of a

pipeline (36) onto the said pre-atomizing element, the
latter (34) being arranged as a separate body on the

hub (30) of the fan (26), characterized in that the
pre-atomizing element (34) has a convex surface, onto

which the water is guided.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the convex body is a sphere.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 2,
characterized in that a web enveloping the sphere is

arranged on the surface of the latter, the said web
intersecting the axis of rotation of the sphere at an

angle (α) which is larger than 0° and smaller than 90°.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 2
or 3, characterized in that the outlet orifice of the

pipeline is arranged next to the sphere in the
direction of rotation and is directed axially onto the

sphere.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the sphere is

composed of two hemispherical dishes, the two 
hemispherical dishes being delimited by a peripheral

rim, and in that the two hemispherical dishes are
integrally and/or positively connected to one another

along the rims resting on one another.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the hemispherical dishes have two

perforations, one perforation being adapted to a shaft
extension of the fan hub, and a mounting screw for

mounting the sphere being led through the other
perforation.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
Claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the surface of the

sphere is partially flattened.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the pre-atomizing element

consists of a hemisphere.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the bisecting line of the

hemisphere coincides with the axis of rotation.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the bisecting line of the

hemisphere is set at an angle (β) to the axis of
rotation.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
Claims 8 to 10, characterized in that the hemisphere

consists of a hemispherical dish with a peripheral rim
and of a circular plate terminating flush with this

peripheral rim and integrally connected to the latter.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that a bar, a

tongue or a further pipe is attached to that side of
the outlet orifice of the pipeline which is directed

towards the axis of rotation of the fan.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim
12, characterized in that the bar, the tongue or the

further pipe is elastic and, if appropriate, consists
of rubber. 
Convection and steam oven according to Claim
12, characterized in that the bar, the tongue or the

further pipe consists of metal.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
Claims 12 to 14, characterized in that the free end of

the bar reaches approximately as far as the axis of
rotation of the fan.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the sphere

is flattened on one side, the flattening being located
opposite the outlet orifice of the pipeline.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
Claims 12 to 16, characterized in that the sphere has a

recess directed into the sphere interior in the
direction of the axis of rotation, and in that the bar

reaches into this recess.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that a bowl open

to the pre-atomizing element is attached to the end of
the pipeline which terminates approximately level with

the axis of rotation of the fan.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim
18, characterized in that the bowl consists of rubber

or plastic.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 18
or Claim 19, characterized in that the open rim of the

bowl is bevelled, and in that part of the rim is
arranged directly next to the pre-atomizing element.
Convection and steam oven according to one of
Claims 18 to 20, characterized in that a pipe open at

both ends, instead of the bowl, is attached to the
pipeline.
Convection and steam oven according to Claim 4
and, where appropriate, according to one of Claims 5 to

18, characterized in that the outlet orifice of the
pipeline is located above the sphere, and in that there

is arranged below the outlet orifice, in the region of
the axis of symmetry of the pre-atomizing element, a 

collecting trough, the lower rim of which terminates
next to the pre-atomizing element.
