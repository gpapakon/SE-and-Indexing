<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (10) for working, for example cutting or pressing, in particular for deformable sleeves, preferably of line junctions or connections, in particular to pressing pliers (10), which have at least two working members, or cutting or pressing jaws (12), and are equipped with a power-transmitting device to provide a driving force for the working members which is transmitted via at least one actuating device (32, 18) for the working members (12) to the latter, the power-transmitting device, according to the invention, generating a tensile force which can be used to close the working members (12), at least one of the actuating devices (32, 18) transmitting a tensile force in progressive fashion to at least one of the working members (12), and the power arm of the actuating device (32, 18) increasing with respect to the work arm of the working members (12).

Compression pliers for deformable sleeves of conduit
connections for sanitary and water pipes, preferably

composite pipes or conduits, having the following features:

two compression jaws (12),
two actuating means (32), which each comprise a control
cam or rocker arm (22), which each actuate one of the

compression jaws,
each of the compression jaws is mounted swivellably
together with the respectively associated actuating

means,
an electric motor, which provides driving power,
a power transmission means, for transmitting the driving
power for the compression jaws from the electric motor

via a spreader means, which comprises two rollers or
spreader rollers, to the actuating means,
the rollers or spreader rollers are so associated with
the control rocker arms that, when the spreader means

moves, the respective actuating means are actuated in
such a way as to close the compression jaws, a

transmission member (30), in particular a pull rod or
shaft (30), transmitting the driving power from the

electric motor to the power transmission means,
characterised by
 the following features:

a) the power transmission means converts the driving power
into a tensile force (Z), in order to move the rollers

or spreader rollers (18) of the spreader means (22, 32)
by way of the transmission member (30), which is

constructed so as to transmit a tensile force, the power
arm of the actuating means (32) increasing relative to

the work arm of the compression jaws (12), 
b) the control cams or rocker arms (22) comprise an area
(24), which, when the compression jaws (12) are in the

closed state, allows the rollers or spreader rollers
(18) to effect movement which is substantially free of

compressive action, in particular free-running, which
discernibly permits completion of the compression

process,
c) when the compression jaws (12) are in the closed state,
the areas (24) of the control cams or rocker arms (22)

extend substantially parallel to one another.
Compression pliers according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 a sensor means is provided, which senses the
substantially action-less movement or free-running and which

may perform an end indicator or shut-off function.
Compression pliers according to one of claims 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the actuating means may be swivelled
about a common pivot point (16) or each may be swivelled

about its own pivot point.
Compression pliers according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 an overload coupling is arranged
between the power transmission means and the electric motor.
Compression pliers according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the actuating means (32) or actuating
arms (32) comprise or each comprise a recess on the opposite

side from the compression jaws (12), to accommodate the pull
rod or shaft (30).
Compression pliers according to one of claims 1 to 5,


characterised in that
 the compression jaws (12) are provided
at compression areas (52) with portions (54, 56) which 

exhibit different dimensions or lengths with respect to the
centre or mid point of the closed compressed areas (52),

which dimensions or lengths, when added together, correspond
substantially to the circumference or outer circumference of

a pressure sleeve (50) to be compressed.
Compression pliers according to claim 6, 
characterised
in that
 the portions at least substantially comprise mutually
adjacent sub-portions (54, 56) with at least two different

radii, which, when added together, preferably substantially
correspond to the circumference or outer circumference of a

pressure sleeve (50) to be compressed.
Compression pliers according to one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the compression jaws (12) comprise a
deflection area (58) at at least one point and preferably at

at least two, in order to absorb any mass movement which may
occur in the material of a pressure sleeve (50), in

particular in the case of dimensional tolerances.
Compression pliers according to claim 8, 
characterised
in that
 the deflection areas (58) are preferably provided at
the end areas of the respective compression jaws (12).
Compression pliers according to one of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the compression jaws (12) are provided
for pushing a sleeve, for example a sliding or pressure

sleeve, axially onto an arrangement consisting of a pipe, in
particular a composite pipe, and a supporting sleeve located

therein, which is inserted into the pipe as far as a flange
on the supporting sleeve.
