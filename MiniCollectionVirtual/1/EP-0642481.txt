<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a humus maker, particularly to apparatus (200) which turns household waste such as kitchen waste into mature humus, the apparatus (200) having a lid (205) and base (203) with an internal windrow device (206) which is operative to be turned manually to keep air holes in the base free for entry of air to promote aerobic decomposition, the air holes being in communication with channels through which water produced by the decomposition process escapes from the apparatus. The lid (205) has hinged parts (217a, 217b) which are raisable for access to the interior, being held down by a handle (231) of the windrow device (203) in one operative position and freed for raising in a second operative position of the handle (231).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HUMUS MAKERThe invention relates to apparatus for making humus.Humus is generally formed by the aerobic degradation of vegetable matter which is suitably moist, e.g. up to 40% water. To produce a suitable, fully matured, sweet smelling humus, degradation under strictly controlled conditions is preferred, whereby oxygen generates heat during the degradation and above a certain temperature no methane or other noxious effluvia are produced. This produces biologically degraded humus of the desired quality and which has a desired moisture content. Such a fully matured humus is nutrient rich, and free from pathogens and toxic elements. It is also a fact that kitchen household refuse is often left to local Authorities to take away and dispose of, usually as landfill. In the United Kingdom for example, humus is produced only on a small scale, most of the U.K.'s domestic waste going to landfill. This refuse amounts to about 90% of the total volume of refuse handled by local Authorities and is moreover environmentally unfriendly as it encourages vermin, can spontaneously combust, is unsightly, and gives off noxious effluvia. There is a need therefore for inexpensive apparatus in which a householder can produce humus, thereby taking compostable refuse out of the waste stream to landfill.Composting may generally be defined as the aerobic production of humus from the aerobic decomposition of organic wastes by microorganisms in a warm, moist atmosphere. Interaction between the organic wastes, microorganisms and aeration produces temperature, carbon dioxide gas, water, and humus. In order to provide suitable conditions particularly for household waste such as kitchen waste, a suitable apparatus is required. Prior apparatus has not been able to produce a suitable product. 

It is accordingly an object of the invention therefore to seek to provide a suitable apparatus.According to the invention there is provided apparatus for making humus, comprising a body for containing material to be composted to humus, characterised by the body having a base, by the base having means for promoting air flow therethrough and through the body, and by a lid, whereby the base and lid promote aerobic decomposition of material to be composted.Using the invention, it is possible to provide a readily erectable apparatus which can be distributed by local Authorities to householders.There may be a plurality of holes through the base. This provides for efficient composting.The base may comprise a plurality of superposed parts. This provides

 CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for making humus, comprising a body for containing material to be composted to htimus, characterised by the body having a base, by the base having means for promoting air flow therethrough and through the body, and by a lid, whereby the base and lid promote aerobic decomposition of material to be composted.
2. Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised by a plurality of holes through the base.
3. Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised by the base comprising a plurality of superposed parts.
4. Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised by the base comprising a perforated planar member on which the material to be composted is received, by a support means for receiving the perforated planar member, and by the support means having fluid passage means for fluid communication with the perforations in the planar member.
5. Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised by the support means comprising two parts which together have a configuration substantially complementary to the planar member, and by a surface of the parts having radially arranged grooves alignable with radially arranged rows of perforations through the planar member.
6. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterised by a windrow device for windrowing material to be composted. 


7. Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised by the windrow device comprising a blade mounted on a rotatable shaft and by a handle of the rotatable shaft mounted exteriorly of the apparatus.
8. Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterised by the handle being mounted exteriorly of the lid and adapted to be turned in a plane substantially parallel to the plane of the lid.
9. Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised by the lid having at least one flap part which is raisable whereby to provide access to the interior of the body.
10. Apparatus according to Claim 8 or Claim 9, characterised by the lid having two raisable flap parts and by the handle being adapted in one operative position to maintain the or each flap part closed and in another operative position permitting the or each flap part to be raised.
11. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterised by a door to permit removal of humus material.
12. Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised by two doors mounted adjacent the base.
13. Apparatus according to any of Claims 7 to 12, characterised by the blade having sharpened edges.
14. Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterised by the blade being substantially centrally mounted on the shaft and by the ends of the blade being profiled to provide a surface adapted for turning the material to be composted. 


15. Apparatus according to any of Claims 10 to 14
f
characterised by strut means of the lid adapted to maintain a flap in the open position.
16. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterised by the lid and base being reversible.
17. Apparatus according to Claim 16, characterised by the lid and base each comprising a member of identical configuration and by the member being reversible.
18. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterised by a plurality of holes through a wall of the body at or adjacent opposite ends thereof.
19. Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterised by being erected from a set of parts comprising a collapsible tube for forming the body and a base insertable in the tube for maintaining same in the erected condition.
20. Apparatus according to Claim 19, characterised by the collapsible tube comprising a plurality of blanks secured edge-to-edge.
21. Apparatus according to Claim 20, characterised by two blanks.
22. Apparatus according to any of Claims 18 to 21 , characterised by the body comprising a double walled sheet material, and by the holes at the upper end (in use) being through an external wall of the sheet and by the holes at the lower end (in use) being through the inner wall of the sheet.
