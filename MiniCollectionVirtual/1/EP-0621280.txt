<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing silanes or organosilicon
hydrides by reduction of the corresponding silicon

halides or organosilicon halides using a magnesium
hydride in a liquid reaction medium, characterized by the

combination of the following features:

a) use of autocatalytically prepared magnesium hydride,
b) use of ethers as reaction medium,
c) continuous removal of the magnesium halide which
deposits on the surface of the magnesium hydride

particles during the reaction so as to form fresh
surface by the action of mechanical energy or ultrasound.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that silicon halides or organosilicon halides used are

compounds of the general formula

R

each a halogenated or unhalogenated hydrocarbon radical

having up to 24 carbon atoms,
X is a halogen radical and
p is from 0 to 3.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that organosilicon halides used are compounds of the

general formula

 and X are as defined above,
R
2
 is a divalent hydrocarbon group having from 2 to 24
carbon atoms and
q is from 0 to 2.
Process according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the radical R
1
 is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl,
aralkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical.
Process according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the radical R
2
 is a divalent alkyl, cycloalkyl,
aryl or aralkyl radical.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the reaction medium used is

tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane.
Process according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a ball mill is used for

feature c).
