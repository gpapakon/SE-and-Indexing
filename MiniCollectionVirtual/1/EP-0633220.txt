<ABSTRACT>
A gas combuster/reactor (50) suitable for use in a Claus 
sulphur plant (10) is 

arranged to direct oxygen axially along the reactor and gas substantially 
across the combuster such that the gas is entrained by the oxygen and 

swirled around the longitudinal axis of the reactor. This arrangement 
increases gas/oxygen mixing and keeps the very hot zones created around the 

oxygen inlet well away from any refractory material (64) used to line the 
reactor (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of operating a gas 
combuster/reactor. The Claus process is commonly used for recovering sulphur from a feed gas 
stream rich in hydrogen sulphide. A typical Claus sulphur plant comprises 
a reaction furnace for partially combusting the feed gas stream with an 
oxygen containing or oxygen enriched gas, a first means of cooling and 
condensing sulphur from the combustion effluent, at least one train 
comprising a reheat means, a catalytic Claus reactor and an additional 
condensing means for further recovering sulphur from said effluent. Presently known reactors comprise a cylindrical casing into which gas is 
introduced either axially or tangentially. Air, oxygen enriched air, or 
oxygen (hereinafter referred to as just oxygen) is introduced into the 
cylinder generally in the same direction as the gas flow in such a way as 
to cause mixing of said gas with the air etc prior to combustion thereof. 
When air and gas are introduced along the axis of the reactor inefficient 
mixing can result, which causes elements such as ammonia which may be 
present in the feed gas to be passed therethrough in an unreacted state. 
If unreacted ammonia is passed to the downstream catalytic stages it can 
very rapidly form into ammonia salts such as ammonium sulphide, for 
example, which tends to block and hence reduce the efficiency of the 
catalytic stage. In order to prevent the pass on of unreacted ammonia from the reactor to 
the catalytic stages it is necessary to ensure that the temperature of the 
combustion chamber is sufficiently great as to ensure the ammonia is fully 
destroyed. In order to ensure complete destruction it is necessary to 
operate with sufficient residence time and with the reactor temperature at 
at least 1,200°C and preferably between 1,500°C and 1,650°C. This can be 
achieved by running the reactor on pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air for 
example or by splitting the gas flow into two portions and burning the 
first portion with all of the air required for the Claus reactor and then 
by introducing the second gas portion of the feed gas into the reactor at a 
position downstream of this initial combustion zone. This latter method is  
 
widely used when more than one feed gas stream is available and where at least 
one major feed stream contains no ammonia since the second portion of the gas 
stream must not contain ammonia. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of operating a reactor 
suitable for use in the Claus process
