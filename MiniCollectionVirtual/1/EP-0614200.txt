<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the overvoltage at the secondary of a transformer, a tertiary winding (N3) is added to it, having the same number of turns as the primary. The voltage of the tertiary is rectified (13) and sent to the source (VO).

<CLAIMS>
Device for limiting the voltage across the
terminals of a secondary winding of a transformer which

includes at least one primary winding, at least one
secondary winding, and at least one tertiary winding N3

(21) which is connected by at least one diode (13, 29) to
the voltage source VO supplying the primary winding N1

(19) of the transformer, characterized in that each
tertiary winding is connected in opposition to the

primary winding.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the terti
ary winding is strongly coupled to the
corresponding secondary winding.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that each tertiary winding includes substantially the

same number of turns as the primary winding.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that at least one inductor (22, 23)

artificially increasing the value of the secondary/
primary leakage inductions of the transformer is arranged

in series with the primary winding.
