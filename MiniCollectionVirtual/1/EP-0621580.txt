<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal device of the type comprising 
a pair of oppositely disposed electrode plates having 

thereon a group of scanning lines and a group of data 
lines, respectively, and a liquid crystal disposed 

between the pair of electrode plates so as to form a 
pixel at each intersection of the scanning lines and 

data lines, is driven by a driving method including the 
steps of applying a scanning selection voltage waveform 

including a scanning selection signal to a scanning 
line within one scanning period, and applying a data 

signal waveform to data lines within the one scanning 
period. The data signal waveform is composed to 

include (i) a data signal period for a data signal 
synchronized with the scanning selection signal and 

providing a time-integrated voltage of zero applied to 
an associate pixel within the period and (ii) an AC 

signal period for an AC signal providing a time-integrated 
voltage of zero applied to the associated 

pixel within the AC signal period. As a result, a 
pixel on a selected scanning line written in an 

optical state, particularly a halftone state, is not 
affected by data signals applied for writing in pixels 

on a subsequently selected scanning line regardless of 
a relaxation time exhibited by the liquid crystal at 

the time of switching thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
driving a liquid crystal device, particularly such a device usable in
television receivers, image projectors, electronic view finders
for cameras, liquid crystal light valves, or a planar
display apparatus . It also relates to a drive circuit for such a
device.A liquid crystal display device of a passive
matrix drive scheme using a TN-liquid crystal has been
known as one which can be produced at a relatively low
cost. However, this type of liquid crystal display
device has a limitation in respect of crosstalk or
contrast and cannot be considered as being suitable
for a display device having high-density display
lines, e.g., a liquid crystal television panel.Clark and Lagerwall have disclosed a bistable
ferroelectric liquid crystal device using a surface-stabilized
ferroelectric liquid crystal in, e.g.,
Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 36, No. 11 (June 1,
1980), p.p. 899 - 901; Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application (JP-A) 56-107216, U.S. Patent Nos.
4,367,924 and 4,563,059. Such a bistable
ferroelectric liquid crystal device has been realized
by disposing a liquid crystal between a pair of
substrates disposed with a spacing small enough to
suppress the formation of a helical structure inherent 
to liquid crystal molecules in chiral smectic C phase
(SmC*) or H phase (SmH*) of bulk state and align
vertical (smectic) molecular layers each comprising a
plurality of liquid crystal molecules in one
direction.Further, as a display device using such a
ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC), there is known one
wherein a pair of transparent substrates respectively
having thereon a transparent electrode and subjected
to an aligning treatment are disposed to be opposite
to each other with a cell gap of about 1 - 3 µm
therebetween so that their transparent electrodes are
disposed on the inner sides to form a blank cell,
which is then filled with a ferroelectric liquid
crystal, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,639,089;
4,655,561; and 4,681,404.The above-type of liquid crystal display
device using a ferroelectric liquid crystal has two
advantages. One is that a ferroelectric liquid
crystal has a spontaneous polarization so that a
coupling force between the spontaneous polarization
and an external electric field can be utilized for
switching. Another is that the long axis direction of
a ferroelectric liquid crystal molecule corresponds to
the direction of the spontaneous polarization in a
one-to-one relationship so that the switching is
effected by the polarity of the external
