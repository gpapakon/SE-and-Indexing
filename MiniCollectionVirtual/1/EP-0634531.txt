<ABSTRACT>
The anchor exhibits an anchor rod (20) as first anchorage member and an anchor plate (14) as second anchorage member. The two anchorage members (20,14) are connected to one another by a connecting means (10). At least the anchor rod (20) can be released from the connecting means (10) in order to permit precisely right-angled installation.

Anchor for joining two building elements, in
particular masonry parts in cavity masonry work, which

are parallel to one another and are separated from one
another by a thermally insulating gap, having two

anchoring members (14, 20) which are connected to one
another at the mutually facing ends by connecting means

(10) which permit parallel displacements (16A, 16B)
transversely to their longitudinal axes, and each of

which has fastening means (24, 36) for fastening in one
of the building elements, at least the first one (20) of

the anchoring members (14, 20) being releasably fastened
to the connecting means (10) and having a rod-shaped

straight anchor end, characterized in that an anchor
plate (14) is inserted as a second anchoring member, so

that it can be centred relative to the first anchoring
member (20), into the connecting means, configured as a

profile body (10) with a guide slot (12), the said anchor
plate being displaceably guided in the longitudinal and

transverse direction relative to the guide slot (12).
Anchor according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first anchoring member (20) is configured as a

straight anchor rod and is screwed into the connecting
means (10).
Anchor according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the anchor plate (14) is guided in the guide slot

(12) by means of notches (30) on both sides so as to be
essentially non-displaceable in its axial direction.
Anchor according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the notches (30) are dimensioned in such a way that

a web (31) formed between the notches (30) is guided with 
lateral play in the guide slot (12) to achieve the

freedom of movement in the transverse direction (16B)
relative to the guide slot (12).
Anchor according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the first anchoring member (20) is

connected to the connecting element (10) by means of
threaded elements (18, 22) which are loosely screwed

together.
Anchor according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a clamping body (32) is arranged

between the two anchoring members (14, 20).
Anchor according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the clamping body (32) which preferably consists of

a foamed plastic material is arranged in the profile body
(10), and in that the anchor plate (14) engages with an

engagement element (28) in the clamping body (32).
Anchor according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the engagement element (28) on the anchor plate (14)

has a shorter width than the length of the guide slot
(12) and can be inserted into the profile body (10) in

the manner of a key by introducing it and turning it
through 90Â° for preassembly.
Anchor according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the fastening means on at least the

first anchoring member (20) configured as an anchor rod
is formed by a screw thread (24) which can be bricked in

or screwed into a plug.
Anchor according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the screw thread (24) is a wood-screw thread.
Anchor according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the anchor plate (14) has holes

(36) as fastening means in its section which can be
bricked in.
