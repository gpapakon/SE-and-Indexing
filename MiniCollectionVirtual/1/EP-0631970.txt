<ABSTRACT>
The elevator machinery (26) comprises a 
motor (6) and its traction sheave (18). 

The rotor (17) is disc-shaped and air gap 
(ir) between it and the stator (14) forms 

a plane which is substantially perpendicular 
to the shaft (13). The stator (14) 

forms a ringlike sector (28) and is 
placed in an outer part and the traction 

sheave (18) is fixed to the rotor, between 
the stator (14) and the shaft (13). 

The diameter of the traction sheave is 
smaller than that of the rotor. The 

structure of the motor allows the use of 
traction sheaves (18) of different diameters 

(2*Rv) with rotors (17) of the 
same diameter. The motor is very flat, 

i.e. its length in the axial direction is 
small.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elevator machinery comprising
a motor, a traction sheave designed to move the elevator
ropes, a bearing, a shaft, a stator provided with a winding,
and a rotating disc-shaped rotor.Traditionally, an elevator machinery consists of a hoisting motor
which, via a gear, drives the traction sheaves around which
the hoisting ropes of the elevator are passed. The hoisting motor,
elevator gear and the traction sheaves are generally
placed in a machine room above the elevator shaft. They can
also be placed beside or under the elevator shaft.Another known solution is to place the elevator machinery in
the counterweight of the elevator. A system with a traditional
elevator machinery placed in the counterweight is presented
e.g. in publication US 3,101,130. A drawback with the placement
of the elevator motor in this solution is that it requires a
large cross-sectional area of the elevator shaft.A third previously known technique is to use a linear motor as
the hoisting motor of the elevator and to place it in the counterweight.Using a linear motor as the hoisting motor of an elevator involves
problems because either the primary part or the so secondary
part of the motor has to be as long as the shaft. Therefore,
linear motors are expensive to use as elevator motors. A
linear motor for an elevator, placed in the counterweight, is
presented e.g. in publication US 5,062,501. However, a linear
motor placed in the counterweight has as certain advantages,
such as the fact that no machine room is needed and that the
motor requires but a relatively small cross-sectional area of
the counterweight.The motor of an elevator may also be of the external-rotor
type, with the traction sheave connected directly to the rotor.
Such a structure is presented e.g. in publication US 4,771,197.
The motor is gearless. The problem with this structure is that, The motor of an elevator may also be of the external-rotor
type, with the traction sheave connected directly to the
rotor. Such a structure is presented e.g. in publication US
4771197. The motor is gearless. The problem with this structure
is that, to achieve a sufficient torque, the length and
diameter of the motor have to be increased. In the structure
presented in US 4771197, the length of the motor is further
increased by the brake, which is placed alongside of the
rope grooves. Moreover, the blocks supporting the motor
shaft increase the motor length still further.In publication US 5018603, figure 8 presents an elevator
motor in which the air gap
