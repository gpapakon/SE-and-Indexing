<ABSTRACT>
A strain washer (1) rigidly secures bone screws (15) in a bone plate (20) having several bores (21). The cylindrical strain washer (1) has a central axis (2), a central bore (3) with an inner thread (4) for receiving the bone screw (15), a lower section (5) with a surface (9) resting on the bone and an upper section (6). The upper section (6) is shaped in such a way that it may be introduced from below into the bore (21) of the bone plate (20). The mean circumference of the lower section (5) is smaller than the mean circumference of the upper section (6). This design allows this strain washer to be used with any type of bone plates (20) and bone screws (15). The strain washer (1) may be selectively set at any desired position of the bone plate (20) and acts at the same time as a spacer for reducing the contact surface between the bone plate (20) and the bone.

Lock washer (1) for rigid fixation of bone screws (15) to a
bone plate (20) which exhibits multiple bore holes (21), whereby

the cylindrical lock washer (1) provides a central axis (2), a
central bore hole (3) with an internal threading (4) that

integrates with a bone screw (15), a lower section (5) with a
bone adjoining surface (9) and an upper section (6), whereby in

case of use of the lock washer (1) the upper section (6) is
locked in the bore hole (21) of the bone plate (20),

characterized in that the middle circumference of the lower
section (5) is smaller than the middle circumference of the

upper section (6).
Lock washer (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that
the interior threading (4) is fully accommodated in the lower

section (5). 
Lock washer (1) according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that it tapers continuously or not continuously

from the upper section (6) towards the lower section (5).
Lock washer (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the upper section (6) provides at least at

the surface (7) which is adjacent to the bone plate (20) a
roughness of structure to improve the torsional strength.
Lock washer (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it is shaped symmetrically.
Lock washer (1) according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it is shaped asymmetrically.
Lock washer (1) according to one of the claims 1 the 6,
characterized in that the surface (9) adjoining the bone is

smaller than the average cross section being perpendicular to
the axis (2) of the upper section (6).
Lock washer (1) according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that it is shaped ellipsoidally.
A fixation device with at least one lock washer (1) according
to one of the claims 1 to 8, a bone plate (20) with an underside

(23) and an upper side (24), which are penetrated by bore holes 
(21), as well as at least one bone screw (15) with a head (16),

a shaft (17) and an exterior threading (18), whereby in case of
fixing the fixation device the upper section (6) of lock washer

(1) can be brought to a stopped position in bore hole (21).
Fixation device according to claim 9, characterized in that
at least one of the bore holes (21) provides a conical section

(26) that widens toward the underside (23) which is shaped in
form-locking fashion with the geometry of the upper section (6)

of lock washer (1) and in case of fixing the fixation device the
upper section (6) of the lock washer (1) is brought to a stopped

position.
Fixation device according to claims 9 or 10, characterized
in that at least one of the bore holes (21) of bone plate (20)

provides at least at the surface that is adjacent to lock
washer (1) a roughening or texturing to increase the torsional

stability.
Fixation device according to claim 11, characterized in that
the roughening or texturing is shaped in form of a tapering

conical section (26) of the bore hole (21). 
Fixation device according to one of the claims 9 to 12,
characterized in that at least one of the bore holes (21) of

bone plate (20) is at its narrowest width (29) equipped with
securing pieces for lock washer (1) that are configured as

elastic nipples (25).
Fixation device according to one of the claims 9 to 13,
characterized in that the upper section (6) of the lock washer

(1) is form-lockingly insertable from below into the bore hole
(21) of the bone plate (20).
Fixation device according to one of the claims 9 to 14,
characterized in that the upper section (6) of the lock washer

(1) is shaped such that it is torsional securedly insertable
into the bore hole (21) of the bone plate (20).
