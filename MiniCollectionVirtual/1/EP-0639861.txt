<ABSTRACT>
A container for the explosion-proof holding of, in particular, drive batteries has, on account of a sealing strip (2), which circumscribes the edge of the container box (1) and is included in the container lining (3), a widened support (5) for the container lid, which comprises a lid sheet (9) and a frame (10) attached to the underside of the latter, the frame being formed by angle-members (12,13), the upright limbs of which are set back and have cutouts (14) pointing upwards. This container structure prevents the production of an oxyhydrogen gas (detonating gas) bell under the lid, protects against the ingress of spray water and excludes the risk of live parts being touched when the container is handled.
