<ABSTRACT>
A non-sterile ultrasonic Doppler apparatus (400/500/600) for locating and puncturing blood vessels is at least partially enveloped in a sterile manner before being used with the sterile device (100/200/300), so that it may be used in a sterile environment. The probe (600) of the ultrasonic Doppler apparatus, which has a groove (610) oriented along the axis of the emitting ultrasonic field, is inserted in a sterile cap (300) in such a way that a guiding tube (340) for the puncturing needle which extends through said cap comes to lie in the groove of the probe. This device completely envelopes the probe, preventing contamination of the sterile puncturing needle, of the skin of the patient and of the doctor by the non-sterile ultrasonic probe (600). In addition, the cap (300) may have a foresection which ensures ultrasonic coupling between the probe (600) and the skin of the patient, so that the doctor need not add any gel. All parts of the disclosed device are designed as disposable articles.

Combination of a non-sterile ultrasonic Doppler
apparatus (400a) for locating and puncturing blood

vessels, which ultrasonic Doppler apparatus (400a) has
a non-sterile probe (600) with a groove (610) running

in the direction of the emitted ultrasonic field, a
non-sterile electronic unit (400) and a non-sterile

cable (500) connecting the probe (600) to the
electronic unit (400), and of a sterile package (100a)

for the ultrasonic Doppler apparatus (400a), the

sterile package (100a) having a tubular and flexible
package element (100) with a closable opening (128) at

its proximal end and a rigid cap (300), the sterile
package (100a) having a guiding tube (340) for a

puncturing needle (380), which guiding tube (340) can
be positioned in the groove (610) of the probe (600),

the cap (300) having the guiding tube (340) passing
through it and being secured at or connectable to the

distal end of the package element (100) in such a way
that at least the probe (600) and a probe-side part of

the cable (500) of the non-sterile ultrasonic Doppler
apparatus (400a) can be introduced through the closable

opening (128) of the package element (100) and into
said element, and that the probe (600) can be guided

into the cap (300) in such a way that the guiding tube
(340) can be positioned at the base of the groove

(610).
Combination according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the guiding tube (340) is longer than the 

groove (610) of the probe (600), in that the cap (300)
is designed in such a way that a part of the guiding

tube (340) protrudes beyond the groove (610) of the
probe (600), guided into the cap, in the direction of

an ultrasonic field emitted by the probe, and in that
this part of the guiding tube protruding beyond the

groove (610) is surrounded by a foresection (700).
Combination according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the foresection (700) is accommodated in a

foresection part (320) of the cap (300).
Combination according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the foresection (700) consists of

a shape-stable aqueous gel whose probe-side surface
(710) is slightly convex and is arranged in the cap

(300) in such a way that it is displaced slightly by
the skin-side surface (630) of the probe when the probe

(600) is inserted into the cap (300).
Combination according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that arranged between the probe (600),

inserted into the cap (300), and the foresection (700)
there is a plate (331) through which the guiding tube

(340) passes and which has a concave or convex surface
(331b) on the skin side for the purpose of forming a

focusing lens.
Combination according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the guiding tube (340) is

additionally secured on the cap (300) with a bridge
(335).
Combination according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the package element (100) has, at

its other end, a further opening, around which a frame
(200) is secured, onto which frame (200) the cap (300)

can be attached.
