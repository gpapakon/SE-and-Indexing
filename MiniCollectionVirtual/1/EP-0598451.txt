<ABSTRACT>
In a multiple access network a main station is to be capable of 
distinguishing signals transmitted by sub-stations (2 ... 11) to the main station (1). A 

method of realising this is the use of SCMA (SubCarrier Multiple Access). According 
to this method the signal to be transmitted is modulated on a subcarrier having its own 

frequency and then modulated on a main carrier in each sub-station. 
In prior-art multiple access network the distribution signals which are to 
be transmitted to the sub-stations by the main station are modulated each on its own 

distribution subcarrier and then applied to a shared distribution modulator. 
 
For diminishing the requirements posed on the high-frequency properties 
of the electronic components necessary for the network, the subcarriers for distribution 

signals and return signals are selected to lie in the same frequency band.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a telecommunication network comprising a main 
station coupled to a plurality of sub-stations over a channel, the main station comprising 
a distribution modulator for modulating on a distribution carrier a combination of a 
plurality of distribution signals modulated on distribution subcarriers, each sub-station 
comprising a return modulator for modulating on a return carrier a return signal 
modulated on its own return subcarrier. The invention likewise relates to a main station and a sub-station to be 
used in a telecommunication network defined above. A telecommunication network according to the opening paragraph is 
known from the journal article "Wide-Band Lightwave Distribution System Using 
Subcarrier Multiplexing" by T.E. Darcy et. al. in IEEE Journal of Lightwave 
Technology, Vol. 7, No. 6, June 1989, pp. 997-1005. Such transmission systems are used for communication between a main 
station and a plurality of sub-stations over a channel used in common by the sub-stations. 
This channel may be formed, for example, by a glass fibre, a coaxial cable or 
a radio link. Applications of such transmission systems are, for example, passive optical 
networks, local area networks, satellite communication systems and mobile telephone 
systems. In telecommunication networks utilizing a common channel for all the 
sub-stations it is to be ensured that no or only little mutual interference is caused by 
sub-stations simultaneously transmitting information to the main station. Generally, this may be achieved by giving the signals to be transmitted by 
the sub-stations their own frequencies, so that at the main station, for example, by 
means of frequency selective filters, the signals coming from different sub-stations may 
be separated. Another option is making a different time slot in a frame available to each 
sub-station, so that only a single sub-station at a time transmits a signal to the main 
station. A simple alternative to said methods is the telecommunication network 
known from said journal article in which sub-stations are used which generate a return  
 
carrier with a carrier frequency that may be about the same or different for the various 
sub-stations. This return carrier is modulated by a return signal modulated on a return 
subcarrier. The return carrier may, for example, be amplitude modulated (intensity) or 
frequency modulated. The main station receives a combination of all the return carriers 
transmitted by the various sub-stations. After this combination of
