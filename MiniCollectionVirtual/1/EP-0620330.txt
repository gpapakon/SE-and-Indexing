<ABSTRACT>
A web element for a covering grating on which it is possible to walk, in particular for covering overflow channels running in the border region of swimming pools, is provided in the form of a bar which exhibits a tread surface (14). The tread surface exhibits a non-slip profiling. The profiling comprises ribs (30) which project in an elevated manner from the tread surface (14), are rectilinear and are combined in groups (32). The tread surface (14) is rectangular. One group (32) of ribs (30) respectively covers a square area of the tread surface, the edge length of said area corresponding to the width of the tread surface. The longitudinal axes (34) of the ribs (30) run at an acute angle ( alpha ) with respect to the longitudinal side (36) of the tread surface (14). The web element reduces the risk of slipping for a person who is walking on the covering grating.

Web elements for a cover grille, which may be walked 
on and which is composed of web elements, in the 

form of a bar having a surface (14) which may be 
walked on which has an anti-slip rip-shaped profiling, 

characterised in that the walking surface (14) is 
rectangular, the ribs (30) are concentrated in 

groups and each group (32) of ribs (30) covers a 
square region of the walking surface (14) the length 

of the edges of which corresponds to the breadth of 
the walking surface. 
Web element as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the profiling is constituted by raised ribs 

(30) projecting out of the walking surface (14). 
Web element as claimed in one of the preceding 

claims, characterised in that the longitudinal axes 
(34) of the ribs (30) extend at an acute angle (α) 

to the longitudinal side (36) of the walking surface 
(14). 
Web element as claimed in Claims 1 and 3, 
characterised in that the longitudinal axes (34) of 

the ribs (30) extend at an angle (α) of 45° and in 
each case one rib is arranged as a diagonal in the 

square region. 
Web element as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in 
that the square rib groups (32) are separated from 

one another by rib-free regions (38). 
Web element as claimed in one of Claims 4 or 5,  
 

characterised in that the longitudinal axes (34) of 
the ribs (30) of adjacent square groups (32) 

intersect one another at an angle (β) of 90°. 
Web element as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in 
that each group (32) has five ribs (30). 
Web element as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cross-sectional 

shape of the ribs (30) is substantially semicircular. 
Web element as claimed in one or more of Claims 2 to 
8 wherein the ribs constitute a macroprofiling, 

characterised in that a microprofiling is 
superimposed on the macroprofiling. 
Web element as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in 
that the microprofiling is a plurality of small 

projections (40). 
Web element as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it may be assembled 

with other web elements (10) of the same type by 
means of tie bars into a cover grille. 
Web element as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that it is constructed integrally 

with other web elements (110) of the same type and 
constitutes a portion of a cover grille unit (108). 
Web element as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises plastics 

material.
