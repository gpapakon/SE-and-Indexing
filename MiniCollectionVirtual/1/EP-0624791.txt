<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an exhaust oxygen sensor 
including a component (138) requiring electricity to 

operate such as a heater or oxygen electrode. A first 
electrical terminal (146) is provided which is in 

electrical contact with the component (138) and has at 
least one male prong (150). A second electrical 

terminal (152) in electrical contact with a wire (158) 
for delivering electrical power from an external 

source is also provided. The second electrical 
terminal has at least one female receptacle (152). 

The male prong (150) and the female receptacle (152) 
are constructed and arranged so at least one of the 

first and second electrical terminals is removable 
with respect to the other terminal. The sensor 

includes a threaded nut (120) slidably received over a 
tubular housing (116) having a crimped lip (118) 

formed thereon near a lower portion of the shell, and 
said nut (120) is constructed and arranged to engage 

said crimped lip (118) and to be threaded onto a 
threaded exhaust manifold boss (124) without rotating 

the housing (116).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas sensors, and
more particularly to automotive exhaust oxygen
sensors, as specified in the preamble of claim 1 and as disclosed for example in EP-A- 398 625.Automotive exhaust oxygen sensors have
elements such as electrodes or heaters, which require
a supply of electricity for the operation thereof.
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates a
prior oxygen sensor 10 in which electrical power is
provided to a sensing element or a heater 12 through
permanent crimped contacts. The contacts have a
terminal pad 14 permanently connected, e.g., soldered,
to the body of the sensor or to an associated terminal
pad on the heater. The contact at the other end
includes a crimped portion 16 which surrounds and
contacts a wire 18 supplying electrical power to the
component. The wire 18 then extends through a housing
body 20 and is connected to an external power source.
Assembling such a sensor requires the sensor body to
be permanently attached to a link of cable with an
interface connector. That assembly process is
extremely difficult to accomplish and this is
undesirable. Many added steps and special tools are
required to connect a sensor with an attached harness
to a manifold boss. The attached harness assemblies
can tangle and nest together making it difficult to
pull out one sensor from a bulk load. Two hands are
required to screw the sensor into a manifold to
prevent the wires from tangling. A special tool
designed to fit around the harness assembly and wires
is required to tighten the sensor into a boss on the
manifold. Furthermore, the wires must be secured to
the engine prior to installation of the sensor into
the vehicle so that damage to the wires and the
vehicle interface connector is prevented. The present invention seeks to overcome the
deficiencies of these prior oxygen sensors.A gas sensor according to the present
invention is characterised by the features specified
in the characterising portion of claim 1.The invention includes an automobile exhaust
oxygen sensor and a method of assembling the same,
said sensor including a single piece tubular shell
having a crimped lip near a lower portion thereof. A
nut is slipped over the tubular shell for engagement
with the crimped lip. The nut includes a threaded
portion corresponding to a threaded boss in an exhaust
system. The crimped lip on the shell prevents the
oxygen sensor shell from being pushed in or out of the
boss. The nut co-operates with a seat formed in the
boss to prevent the oxygen sensor shell from being
pushed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A gas sensor comprising: a
tubular-shaped shell (116) and a gas-sensing element

(138) carried in the shell(116); characterised in that
the tubular-shaped shell (116) has a crimped lip (118)

formed near a lower portion of the shell; and the
sensor includes a nut (120) slidably received over the

tubular-shaped shell (116) for engagement with the
crimped lip (118); said nut (120) having a threaded

portion for engagement with a threaded boss (124).
An exhaust gas sensor according to claim
1, in which said gas-sensing element (138) comprises a

flat plate gas sensor which includes a heating element
and which is held in position by a first cement

composition (140) comprising calcium aluminate
surrounding an upper portion of the flat plate sensor

and extending to the shell (116), a glass seal (142)
surrounding a middle portion of the flat plate sensor,

and a second cement composition (144) comprising
calcium aluminate surrounding a lower portion of the

flat plate sensor; so that the first and second cement
compositions (140,144) firmly hold the flat plate

sensor in position in the shell and the glass seal
(142) allows for thermal expansion of the flat plate

sensor.
A gas sensor according to claim 1 or 2,
comprising an automotive exhaust oxygen sensor in

which there is a barbed ring (130) slipped over the
upper portion of the tubular-shaped shell (116) which

includes a barb (132) for engagement with the shell
(116); and a retaining cap (134) is slipped over the

upper portion of the shell (116) and the barbed ring
(130), and includes at least one inwardly-biased leg

(136) engaging the barbed ring (130) so that the upper
portion of the oxygen sensor is sealed. 
A gas sensor according to any one of the
preceding claims, in which the sensor includes first

and second electrical terminals (146,148,152) carried
in said shell (116), said first electrical terminals

(146,148) being secured to said gas-sensing element
(138), and said second electrical terminals (152)

being connected to an external power source, one of
said electrical terminals having at least one male

prong (150) and the other electrical terminal having a
corresponding female receptacle (152), and said first

and second electrical terminals (146,148,152) being
constructed and arranged to be selectively removable

with respect to each other.
