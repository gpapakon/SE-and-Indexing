<ABSTRACT>
A synchronous electric motor particularly for small users 
includes a rotor (7) arranged in a stator unit that has a 

mainly axial extension. The stator unit includes two polar 
bodies (3, 4) which are substantially laminar and are fixed 

to an intermediate body (5) that supports an electric coil 
(6) with circular turns (17). The motor can be used to drive 

centrifugal micro-pumps that have a predominantly axial 
extension, minimizing their bulk and weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synchronous electric 
motor for small tools and devices such as for example micro-pumps 
for aquariums, which includes a central supporting 
body for an electric coil and two substantially laminar 
stator poles between which a rotor with high magnetic 
retentivity is rotatably inserted. The invention equally 
relates to a series of submersible centrifugal micro-pumps 
driven by these motors. The basic components of conventional synchronous motors are 
a stator, or fixed part, which supports two coils, or 
electric windings, for generating the magnetic flux, and a 
rotor, generally of the permanent-magnet type. The stator is generally formed by a pack of ferromagnetic 
laminations which are substantially U-shaped, from a top 
plan view. The coils are respectively constituted by turns 
of electric wire, wound on each one of the two parallel 
portions of the pack of laminations. The free ends of the 
portions form stator poles between which the rotor is 
rotatably inserted so that its rotation axis is 
substantially at right angles to the axis of the turns of 
the coils. When the conventional synchronous motors are associated with 
some user devices, the size of these devices is considerably 
increased, especially along two mutually perpendicular 
directions: one corresponds to the axis of the rotor and the 
other is substantially parallel to the axes of the stator 
coils.  Furthermore, due to the shape of the pack of laminations, 
the turns of the coils are approximately square and the mean 
turn length is greater than the circumference inscribed in 
the mean turn, thereby increasing the mean diameter of the 
stator. Accordingly, a drawback of conventional synchronous electric 
motors is their relatively large bulk which prevents their 
use in devices which, due to functional or aesthetic 
reasons, must have small dimensions and/or slender shapes, 
such as for example submersible micro-pumps which are 
suitable for insertion in small openings of jerry-cans and 
the like. In order to obviate this drawback, a synchronous electric 
motor has been devised and described in the European Patent 
application No. 93118888.2 dated November 24, 1993, in the 
name of this same Applicant. This motor is schematically 
shown in Figure 1, of the present application wherein the 
rotor R has a rotation axis that is substantially parallel 
to the longitudinal axis of the coils B. With this configuration there is a considerable reduction in 
dimensions along at least one of the three
