<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a nozzle cap (1) 
for a 

composite container (10) containing a low-viscosity liquid such 

as humidity-curing 
type adhesive of α-cyanoacrylate-based adhesive, solvent-volatile type 

adhesive, various chemicals, food, and ink. 
The present invention is a container with a nozzle cap which includes a 
nozzle (5) connecting to a container body containing contents and 

a cap mounted 
threadly to said nozzle for closing a discharge port of said nozzle, 

characterized in that a head of said cap is provided with a column element 
projecting inwardly for closing said nozzle and that a 

head of said column 
element is provided with a concave hole (3) into which the 

tip of said nozzle is 
removably inserted or fitted. 
According to the present invention, a superior, unique effect is exhibited 
such that the closure of the nozzle is easily and completely performed, and that 

adhesive or the like adhering to the tip of the nozzle does not spread around 
and cure, thereby not forming the so-called umbrella- or mushroom-shaped solid 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a nozzle cap for a 
composite container containing a low-viscosity liquid such as humidity-curing 
type adhesive, for example, α-cyanoacrylate-based adhesive, solvent-volatile 
type adhesive, various chemicals, food, and ink. Liquid adhesive as a representative of low-viscosity liquid includes 
different types such as solvent-volatile type and humidity-curing type, wherein 
the solvent-volatile type cannot employ a plastic tube, and the humidity-curing 
type also cannot employ a humidity-permeative plastic tube. Therefore, the 
adhesives of these types have employed a metallic tube such as an aluminium tube 
and a lead tube. However, a metallic tube which has no restoring force, after discharging 
adhesive of contents, causes the so-called liquid trickle. For example, where 
the contents such as those of instant adhesive are low viscosity, such 
phenomenon becomes more apparent. Also a metallic tube which has no restoring 
force leaves concavities as it is used, thereby causing its use to become 
difficult and its appearance to be deformed and become bad. Further, a 
metallic tube cannot be allowed to stand, so that in order to prevent the 
contents from flowing out when the tube is allowed to be laid in the course of 
use, a cap must be applied to the tube each time the tube is laid, thereby 
giving a troublesome feeling. In addition, where the contents are a little in 
quantity, a problem exists in that a metallic tube is small in size and thus 
difficult to handle. In order to solve these problems, as disclosed, for exmaple, in Japanese 
Examined Utility Model SHO 58-8682 and Japanese Examined Utility Model SHO 62-44914, 
fittingly mounting of a cylindrical elastic tube or a pipe-shaped plastic 
on the outer periphery of a metallic tube is proposed. However, the method is such that the elastic restoring force of the elastic 
tube or the pipe-shaped plastic allows the metallic tube to be restored and  
 
thus a discharged liquid accumulated in its outlet to be sucked, so that the 
restoring properties is not sufficient and thus the sucking force of sucking the 
discharged liquid is weak. Particularly, a problem exists in that the 
restoring properties become weak as the tube is used, thereby causing the 
application purpose to be not sufficiently achieved. As a result of concentrated research, the present inventor and others have 
previously invented, as a composite container for a low-viscosity liquid to 
solve these problems, a composite container
