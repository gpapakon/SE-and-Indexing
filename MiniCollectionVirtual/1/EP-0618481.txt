<ABSTRACT>
A machine capable of producing photographic colour 
prints, both from images captured on film and from 

digitally encoded images, consists essentially in a 
conventional machine as used to make colour prints from 

images on film, also comprising a one-line cathode ray 
tube (7 or 7a or 7b) positioned along the path followed 

by a strip of light-sensitive paper (31) from a supply 
roll (3) to a set of chemical treatment baths (60), 

preceding or following the printing surface (29), of 
which the projecting head (71) generates a pencil-thin 

line comprising a high number of pixels in a notably 
broad range of colours. The single lines are emitted 

gradually and in ordered succession by the projecting 
head (71), impacting on a corresponding length of the 

light-sensitive paper (31) as it advances across the 
head and thus generating an image of high definition 

and chromatic fidelity directly on the light-sensitive 
surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic
printing machine, and more exactly an apparatus by
means of which both photographic images and digitally
encoded images can be printed on light-sensitive paper.The art field of photography embraces printing machines
by which images are projected from film onto discrete
strips of light-sensitive paper; the exposed paper then
passes through a succession of chemical treatment baths
to be developed, and thereafter into a drying chamber,
whereupon the finished photographs are ejected from the
machine automatically.Devices have also been developed for the printing of
digitally encoded images obtained with video cameras or
generated using computer graphics or other conventional
systems and recorded on convenient storage media such
as magnetic tape or magnetic or optical disk, typically
the familiar CD; the digital information is relayed by
a suitable electronic processor to a cathode ray tube,
and the entire image reproduced and projected by means
of appropriate optical devices onto the light-sensitive 
paper, which is then processed in the traditional way.Conventional systems for reproducing digitally encoded
images normally make use of black-and-white cathode ray
tubes which in order to generate the full image must
project a succession of three primary black and white
images; these monochrome images are the product of a
previous filtering operation executed optically or
electronically in the three primary colours, and must
be reconverted when projected onto the light-sensitive
paper with the corresponding coloured filters, suitably
piloted and controlled in conjunction with the relative
exposure times by an electronic processor.US 4 742 375 discloses a solution in which the optical
and electronic printing units in question can be either
embodied separately and applied individually thus to a
basic unit for developing the light-sensitive paper, or
incorporated together with the developing unit into one
assembly to create a single combination machine. In this
solution the CRT image projection system must be always
positioned facing to the optical path of the photographic
image system.A former Japanese Patent Application 820079629 published as JP58-196792A
discloses a special one-line cathode ray tube which, instead of
generating a full raster image comprising a plurality
of transverse lines in the manner of a flared cathode 
ray tube, emits a single transverse line of the image
ensuring exact reproduction of the relative colours and
impacting directly on the

A photographic printing machine (1) arranged to produce both colour photographs
generated from images captured on film and colour photographs generated from

digitally encoded images, said photographic printing machine comprising a
conventional machine, housed within a casing (11, 12, 13), for producing developed

colour photographs from images on film,

wherein said conventional machine comprises means arranged to uncoil
light-sensitive paper (31) from a supply roll (3), a guillotine device (8) arranged to cut

said light-sensitive paper (31) into discrete strips, pairs of pinch rollers (41, 42, 43,
44, 45) and guides (51, 52, 53) arranged to position said light-sensitive paper (31)

appropriately on a printing surface (29), an image analyzer (26), an optical projector
(2, 27, 28) arranged to project images from a film (25) onto said light-sensitive paper

(31), a group of chemical treatment baths (60), a drying chamber (61), and further
pairs of pinch rollers (46, 47, 48, 49) arranged to direct said light-sensitive paper (31)

forward after printing to said group of chemical treatment baths (60);

characterized in that said guillotine device (8) is arranged to cut said light-sensitive
paper (31) into said discrete strips upstream of said printing surface (29);

and that said photographic printing machine (1) also comprises:

a one-line cathode ray tube (7 or 7a or 7b) positioned along the path followed by
said discrete strips of the light-sensitive paper (31), between the supply roll (3) and

the entry point to the chemical treatment baths (60), preceding or following the
printing surface (29) and internally or externally of the structure afforded by the 

casing (11, 12, 13), of which the projecting head (71) is arranged to generate a
single pencil-thin line of light formed by the progressively ordered emission from end

to end of a large number of pixels in a large range of colours, and is disposed in
close proximity to the exposure surface of the light-sensitive paper (31);
a suitable guide (51, 53, 54) or other equivalent means arranged to maintain said
discrete strips of light-sensitive paper (31) in position against the projecting head

(71);
drive means (41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47) with precision movement arranged to
advance said discrete strips of light-sensitive paper progressively, continuously or by

minimal uniform increments, in the plane of the light-sensitive paper (31); and
a suitable processor arranged to pilot the analysis of images captured on film for
normal photographic reproduction, as well as to control and coordinate the operation

of the various devices employed both for photographic reproduction and for
electronic reproduction;

wherein said projecting head (71) and said drive means (41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47)
are arranged to operate such that the emission of a plurality of single lines of light

progressively and in ordered succession by said projecting head (71) combines with
the precision movement generated by the drive means (41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47) to

produce a corresponding plurality of accurately equispaced lines on the exposure
surface of said discrete strips of light-sensitive paper (31), so as to collectively and

directly form an image of high definition and chromatic fidelity.
