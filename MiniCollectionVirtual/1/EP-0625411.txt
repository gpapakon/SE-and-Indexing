Apparatus (4) for cutting semi-rigid sheets (21) one by one, in 
particular sheets of corrugated cardboard, the apparatus including a backing 

cylinder (9) and a cutting tool (16) fixed to a tool-carrier plate (10), the tool-carrier 
plate (10) being driven with reciprocating forward-and-return motion 

between a first position in which the cutting tool (16) is situated behind the 
backing cylinder (9) and a second position in which it is situated behind the 

backing cylinder (9), the sheet (21) being inserted over the cutting (16) when the 
tool-carrier plate has left its first position, being cut as it passes beneath the 

backing cylinder (9), and then being removed from the cutting tool (16) when the 
tool-carrier plate (10) is in its second position, characterized in that, the sheet (21) 

being fed from the preceding station (3) by transfer means (7) and then positioned 
on the tool-carrier plate (10) and inserted beneath the backing cylinder (9) by 

launching means (8), it comprises, connected to a controlling electronic circuit (24) 
provided with input means (25) for receiving operating parameters including at 

least the length 
l
 of the cutting tool: 

a) at least one independent motor (11) capable of rotating in either 
direction and having electronic servo-control, the motor driving the tool-carrier 

plate (10) in its reciprocating motion, 
b) an independent motor (28) having electronic servo-control and 
driving the launching means (8), 
c) monitoring means (23) for monitoring the rotation of the backing 
cylinder (9), 
d) a position-identifying system (26) for identifying the position of a 
predetermined element of the sheet (21), said system being situated upstream from 

the backing cylinder (9), 
 
   and in that the controlling electronic circuit (24) is programmed so that 

firstly the amplitude of the reciprocating motion is a function of the parameter 
l
, 
secondly the linear speed of the tool-carrier plate (10) is constantly equal to the 

peripheral linear speed of the backing cylinder (9) so long as the cutting tool (16) is 
in contact with said backing cylinder (9), and thirdly the offset observed the ideal 

position and the real position of the predetermined element of the sheet (21), 
detected by the position-identifying system (26) is corrected by corresponding 

variation in the drive of the motor (28) fitted to the launching means (8).  
 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
predetermined element being the leading edge (21
a
) or the trailing edge of the 
sheet, the position-identifying system consists in a position sensor (26). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that, the 
predetermined element being a predetermined printed zone of the sheet, the 

position-identifying system consists in a camera. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
controlling electronic circuit (24) is programmed to keep the tool-carrier plate (10) 

in it first position whenever the position-identifying system does not detect any 
sheet. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
controlling electronic circuit (24) is programmed so that the tool-carrier plate (10) 

is stopped in its second position for a determined length of time 
t
 which is input as 
an operating parameter via the input means. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
transfer means (7) are fitted with an independent motor (27) that is electronically 

servo-controlled and that is connected to the electronic circuit (24), and in that 
monitoring means (31) are mounted on the member (32) for displacing the sheet 

(21) to the preceding station (3), said monitoring means (31) being connected to 
said electronic circuit (24), and in that the latter is programmed so that firstly the 

speed of the transfer means (7) is constantly equal to the speed of the sheet leaving 
the members (32) for displacing it from the preceding station (3), and secondly the 

launching means (8) are controlled as a function of said speed so that the sheet (21) 
has the same speed as the peripheral linear speed of the backing cylinder on 

reaching the tool-carrier plate (10).
