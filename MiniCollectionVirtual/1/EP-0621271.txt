which has an alicyclic diamine group at the 2-position: 


wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ may be the same or different and 
each represents hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted lower 

alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl, halogen, 
hydroxyl, amino, lower alkoxy, carboxyl, carbamoyl and nitro, 

or any two of R¹ to R⁴ may be linked together to form a three 
to seven-membered ring structure comprising carbon atoms 

alone or carbon atoms and 1 to 2 hetero atoms, which may be 
substituted; R⁵ and R⁶ may be the same or different and each 

represents substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl, 
substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl, substituted or 

unsubstituted aralkyl group or an alkoxycarbonyl group, or R⁵  
and R⁶ may be linked together to form a three to seven-membered 

ring structure comprising carbon atoms and 1 to 2 
nitrogen atoms, which may be substituted; X⁻ is a 

pharmaceutically acceptable anion; and m and n may be the 
same or different and each is an integer of 1 to 3. The 

compound shows excellent 5-HT₃ receptor antagonism and is 
useful as an antiemetic agent and also as a peristalsis 

controlling agent, an analgesic agent, an antianxiety agent 
and a schizophrenia treating agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to benzoxazole derivatives
which show serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonism.In recent years, compounds having serotonin 5-HT3
receptor antagonism have been studied extensively and some of
them are now used in the clinical field, because of their
function to repress nausea and emesis as side effects caused
by the use of carcinostatic agents such as cisplatin and the
like or by radiotherapy. However, as is evident in benzamide
base drugs, these prior art compounds are not always
satisfactory in view of their drug effects free from side
effects.An object of the invention is to provide a compound
having an excellent serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonism.The inventors of the present invention have reported
recently that a benzothiazole derivative has an excellent
cardiotonic effect (JP-A-4-316565) (The term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application").
Also, EP-A-0398425 discloses benzoxazol derivatives having
a N-(phenoxyalkyl)piperazin moiety at the 2-position and an
addition salt therof; US-A-3331843 discloses benzoxazole derivatives
having a N-(aminoalkyl)piperazin moiety at the 2-position;
and J. Med. Chem., 11(5), 1090-1092 (1968) discloses benzoxazole
compounds having a N-(methyl)piperazin moiety at the
2-position without disclosing or referring to serotonin 5-HT3
receptor antagonism of those compounds. EP-A-0512939 discloses
benzimidazole derivatives having a N-(hydroxyalkyl)piperazin
moiety at the 2-position and having a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor
antagonism; however, there is no disclosure of benzoxazole derivatives.
Thereafter, the present inventors have
continued studies on the synthesis of new derivatives and
found that a benzoxazole derivative has a strong and
selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonism.  Since the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is possessed of
not only antiemetic effect but also peristalsis
enhancing effect, analgesic effect, antianxiety effect and
the like, it is also useful as a peristalsis controlling
agent, an analgesic, an antianxiety agent and an agent for
the treatment of schizophrenia.The present invention provides a compound represented
by the formula (1)

according to claim 1 
and a compound represented by the formula (2)

according to claim 2.Further, the present invention provides a 5-HT3 
receptor antagonist which comprises the compound represented
by the above formula (1) or (2) as an active ingredient and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.According to the present invention, the alkyl moiety
