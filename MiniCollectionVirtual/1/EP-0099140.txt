<ABSTRACT>
Toner powder comprising thermoplastic polymer, col­
ouring material and possibly other additives, such as 

magnetically attractable material, the thermoplastic poymer 
bearing in its molecule one or more immiscible crystalline 

and amorphous blocks, the crystalline blocks forming the 
continuous phase in the polymer and having a melting point 

between 45 and 90°C, and the amorphous blocks having a Tg 
which is at least 10°C above the melting point of the 

crystalline blocks. 
A method of forming fixed images on an image-­
receiving material, in which, using such a toner powder, a 

powder image is formed on a medium the surface of which 
consists of a material having less adhesion for the softened 

powder than has the image-receiving material, the powder 
on this medium is softened by heating and the softened 

powder is brought into pressure-contact with the image-­
receiving material.
