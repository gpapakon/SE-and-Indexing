<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing certain catalytically active metal 
complexes. More particularly, this invention relates to such a process involving oxidation of the 
metal center of a complex to form active catalyst compositions useful for polymerizing olefins, 
diolefins and/or acetylenically unsaturated monomers. The use of homogeneous Ziegler-Natta type catalysts in the polymerization of 
addition polymerizable monomers is, of course, well known in the prior art. In general, these 
soluble systems comprise a Group 4 or Lanthanide metal compound and a metal alkyl 
cocatalyst, particularly an aluminum alkyl cocatalyst. Several preparations for homogeneous 
olefin polymerization catalysts are known. These involve reacting a transition metal chloride 
with an aluminum alkyl, reacting a transition metal alkyl and a aluminum alkyl, reacting a 
transition metal alkyl with a proton source, or reacting a transition metal alkyl with a cationic 
oxidant. In these examples the oxidation state of the transition metal remains unchanged or 
may actually be reduced. In Polyhedron, 8(13-14), 1838-1843 (1989), M. Bochmann et al., disclosed an 
oxidative process for preparing bispentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium methyl 
tetraphenylborate using silver tetraphenylborate oxidant in tetrahydrofuran solvent. The 
complex was inactive in the polymerization of ethylene. In J. Am. Ch. Soc. 109, 4111-4113 (1987) there is disclosed a process for 
preparation of cationic zirconium (IV) benzyl complexes by one electron molecular oxidation of 
d0 organometallic compounds in tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride solvent. In US-A-5,189,192 a metal center oxidation and cation forming process employing 
a cationic oxidizer is disclosed. In EP-A-416,815 there are disclosed certain novel constrained 
geometry complexes possessing unique catalytic properties. In EP-A-468,651 there is disclosed a 
unique molecular oxidative activation procedure for preparing complexes useful as addition 
polymerization catalysts. The present invention lies in the discovery of a novel technique for preparing 
certain metal complexes involving both metal center oxidation and cation complex formation 
via electron transfer in a single step by use of a neutral organic oxidant. Beneficially, the use of 
neutral reactants permits the synthesis to be performed in hydrocarbon solvents normally 
employed for olefin polymerizations instead of polar or oxygenated solvents. Consequently, in 
the present invention contamination with deactivating
