<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10) for feeding sheets seriatim from a sheet 
supply stack (S). The apparatus comprises a sheet feed head 

assembly (30) including a plenum (32), a vacuum source (V) in 
flow communication with the plenum, and a mechanism, such 

as a feed belt (36), for example, associated with the plenum 
for urging a sheet acquired by vacuum in a sheet feeding 

direction away from the sheet supply stack. The sheet supply 
stack is supported, for example in a hopper on a support 

platform (14), so as to maintain the topmost sheet in such 
stack at a predetermined level in spaced relation with respect 

to the urging mechanism of the sheet feed head assembly. A 
first positive air supply (42) directs a flow of air at the sheet 

supply stack to levitate the top several sheets in the supply 
stack to an elevation enabling the topmost sheet to be 

acquired by vacuum from the sheet feed head assembly 
plenum; and a second positive air supply (44) directs a flow of 

air at an acquired sheet to assure separation of any additional 
sheets adhering to such topmost sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to sheet 
handling apparatus for reproduction apparatus for example, 
and more particularly to a receiver sheet supply and feed 
apparatus, including a vacuum corrugation belt feeder and a 
positive air pressure separator. In typical reproduction apparatus such as copiers or 
printers, for example, information is reproduced on individual 
cut sheets of receiver material such as plain bond paper or 
transparencies. Such receiver sheets are stored in a stack and 
fed seriatim when copies are to be reproduced. The sheet 
feeder for the reproduction apparatus must be able to handle a 
wide range of sheet types and sizes reliably and without 
damage. Sheets must be fed individually; that is, without 
misfeeds or multi-feeds. US-A-5,150,892 discloses a sheet feeding apparatus 
according to the preamble of Claim 1 
comprising a vaccum transporting device adapted to suck a 
top sheet of the stack and transport it, and a device 
adapted to locate forcibly at least two portions of the top 
sheet away from the vacuum transporting device so as to 
corrugate the top sheet. A pair of floating nozzles and a 
pair of separating nozzles project an air flow against the 
stack in order to separate the top sheets of the stack. The document EP-A-0 251 616 comprises an air knife to feed 
sheets from the top of a stack. The air knife includes a 
pair of tapering fluffer jet nozzles, an additional pair of 
auxiliary fluffer jets and a converging slot jet with an 
array of several nozzles. The Patent GB-A-1,101,309 shows a feeder device for fragile 
laminar articles. More than one air jet nozzle is used to 
direct onto the uppermost article. The fragile articles are 
wafers which need to be separated in order to transfer them 
to the next processing station.  
 Reproduction apparatus sheet feeders are typically of 
two types, vacuum feeders or friction feeders. One type of 
vacuum feeder is shown in US -A-4,169,674. This vacuum 
feeder, commonly referred to as an oscillating vacuum feeder, 
includes an oscillating tube through which vacuum is applied 
to tack a sheet to the surface of the tube (sheet acquisition) 
for withdrawal from the sheet supply stack. Nip rollers, in 
cooperative relation with bearings on the tube downstream of 
sheet acquisition zone in a sheet feeding direction, urge a 
separated sheet from the sheet supply stack along a feed path 
away from the supply stack. While such feeder is considered 
to be highly effective, it does have some limitations in feeding 
extreme
