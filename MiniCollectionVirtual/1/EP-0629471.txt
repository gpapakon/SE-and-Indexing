<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for irrigating perforations in the surface of 
a perforated material (M) during surface treatment operations. The 

apparatus includes a three-layer substrate (100) of predetermined length 
including a first fluid-interactive layer (102), a second resilient 

layer (104), and a third rigidifying layer (103). In the method, the 
substrate (100) is placed beneath the perforated surface (M) to be 

treated with the perforated material (M) overlying the first layer 
(102). Thereafter, the surface treatment tool (T) is used to apply and 

remove pressure to and from the surface during performance of the 
surface treatment opertion. In this way, as the surface is treated, 

fluid applied to the surface during the operation is caused to pass back 
and forth to and from the first layer (102) and through the perforations 

to irrigate the perforations and thereby keep them from becoming 
clogged. In addition, the pressure applied to the surface by the tool 

(T) causes fluid held by the first layer (102) beneath the perforated 
surface to be expelled through the perforations in a region about the 

tool-surface interface, thereby flushing those perforations peripheral 
to the tool-surface interface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes of abrading, 
cleaning or polishing perforated materials, and more particularly 
to a method for irrigating perforations in surfaces 
of such materials during such treatments thereby preventing 
clogging of the perforations during the surface treatment 
operations.  
 Perforated materials, and especially micro-perforated 
materials, have recently gained much notoriety in the aerospace 
technology for their ability to ensure conformance of the flow of 
air or other fluid to or over a surface. In particular, these 
materials have proven very useful in providing laminar flow 
control of fluids over aerodynamic surfaces. Often, during manufacture of perforated materials, the 
major surfaces of the materials need to be treated to obtain a 
polished, blemish-free finish. And following extended use, the 
surfaces need to be re-finished to remove deposits or various 
imperfections that could affect the laminar flow characteristics 
of the perforated surface which has been immersed in the fluid. At present, all known methods of abrading, polishing or 
cleaning perforated surfaces are inadequate insofar as remnants 
of abrading, polishing or cleaning compounds remain within the 
perforations following surface treatment. These surfaces must 
thereafter be further treated, as for example by blowing 
pressurized air through the perforations to expel the remnants 
trapped in the holes. As a result of such added steps, these 
known methods not only prolong the time before the surfaces are 
useful, but also require the use of unnecessary equipment, thus 
increasing the cost of performing the entire abrading, polishing 
or cleaning operation.  
 Attention is drawn to GB-A-2,257,382 which relates to a 
composite polishing pad for semiconductor processing. The 
invention provides an improved composite polishing pad which 
includes a first layer of elastic material, a second, stiff 
layer and a third layer optimized for slurry transport. The 
third layer is the layer against which the water makes contact 
during the polishing process. The second layer is segmented 
into individual sections physically isolated from one another 
in the lateral dimension. Each segmented section is resilient 
across its width yet cushioned by the first layer in the 
vertical direction. In accordance with the present invention a method for 
irrigating a perforated panel as set forth in independent 
claim 1 is provided. Preferred embodiments of the present 
invention are disclosed in the dependent

surfaces and a plurality of openings extending between the first and second surfaces, 

comprising:
