<ABSTRACT>
An electric machine, in particular a three-phase alternator for internal combustion engines, is proposed which serves to supply an electrical system of a motor vehicle and is to be mounted on the drive assembly by means of a pivot arm attachment. In order to permit the pivot arm holes (24, 25) in the two halves (15, 16) of the housing of the machine to be flush, the rotational play of the housing halves with respect to one another is strictly limited in that at least one of the platforms (20) on the circumference of one of the halves (16) of the housing dips as a centring platform (20a) in a positively engaging fashion in the circumferential direction into a recess (19) assigned to it, in the other half (15) of the housing.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical machine, in particular a three-phase 
alternator for internal combustion engines, having a two-component 

housing, which is screwed together, for clamping 
in a stator, at the external circumference of whose 

laminated core (12) at least one central laminate has a 
plurality of radially outwardly protruding projections 

(14) which are provided with attachment holes, on the one 
hand rest in axial depressions (19) on the floor of one 

half of the housing in the circumferential area of the 
said half of the housing and on the other hand are 

clamped in, using attachment screws, between the two 
halves of the housing in the area of the other half of 

the housing by in each case one relatively small platform 
which dips into the depressions, the two halves of the 

housing having at least one swivel arm hole, characterized 
in that, in order to align the swivel arm holes (24, 

25) which are assigned to one another, a rotational play 
of the two halves (15, 16) of the housing with respect to 

one another is tightly limited in that at least one of 
the platforms (20) of the one half (16) of the housing 

dips, as a centring platform (20a), in the circumferential 
direction into the assigned depression (19) of the 

other half (15) of the housing in a positively engaging 
fashion. 
Electrical machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the depressions (19) and platforms (20, 

20a) of the two halves (15, 16) of the housing have a 
semicircular cross-section, the centring platform (28) 

dipping into the depression (19) at least in a circumferential 
area, with a push fit (D, d).  

 
Electrical machine according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the diameter (d') of the other platforms 

(20) is at least 10% smaller than the diameter (D) of the 
depression (19), the centring platform (28) being widened 

on both sides in the circumferential direction of the 
half (16) of the housing in a knob shape as far as the 

diameter (D) of the depression (19) which is assigned to 
it. 
Electrical machine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the centring platform (20 a) is turned at 

its knob widened portion (39) at least as far as the 
diameter (D) of the depression (19). 
Electrical machine according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the depression 

(19) which receives the centring platform (20a) has a 
collar (41) which extends further forwards than the other 

depressions (19) and the edge (42) lying opposite it on 
the centring platform (20 a) is correspondingly further 

set back. 
Electrical machine according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the centring platform (20a) and/or the 

collar (41) of the depression (19) is provided at the 
front with a chamfer (43).
