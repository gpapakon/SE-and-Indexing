<ABSTRACT>
A multi-functional gasoline detergent composition is disclosed providing a good balance of properties leading to reduced engine deposits, little or no valve stick, and without effect on Octane Requirement Increase (ORI). The compositions comprise the combination of an isobutenylsuccinimide detergent, a mono-end capped polypropylene glycol as the carrier oil, e.g. a polypropyleneglycol monoether, and a hydrocarbon solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-functional detergent-containing 
additive compositions for hydrocarbon fuels, more especially gasoline. 
More especially, the invention relates to alkenylsuccinimide-based 
detergent compositions for hydrocarbon fuels and especially gasoline. Multi-functional detergent-containing additive compositions for 
gasoline have to satisfy a large number of criteria, amongst the most 
important of which are: 
i) elimination of carburettor and injector fouling; ii) good detergency in the intake port and intake valve regions 
of the engine; iii) elimination of valve stick, a problem often associated with 
the use of high molecular weight detergents; iv) corrosion protection; v) good demulsifying characteristics; and vi) little or no effect on the Octane Requirement Increase 
(ORI) of modern engines. Amongst the most effective ashless detergents for lubricating 
oils and fuel compositions for internal combustion engines, both spark 
ignition and compression ignition, are alkyl or alkenyl substituted 
succinimides of the formula I: 
 
where R1 is an alkyl or alkenyl group, especially a long chain 
polyalkenyl group, e.g. polyisobutenyl, and D is the residue of a 
polyalkylenepolyamine, and an immense amount of prior art is available 
describing the manufacture and use of these compounds as detergents for 
fuels and lubricating oils. The following prior art is merely a  
 
representative selection of the total prior art available in this field 
and covers what the present applicant believes to be the art closest to 
the present invention. First of all, brief reference is made to the following patent 
specifications, which illustrate various routes available for the 
preparation of the alkenyl substituted succinimides used in the present 
invention, and which serve to illustrate various principles involved 
and which need to be taken into account when considering what is meant 
by an "alkyl or alkenyl-substituted succinimide detergent". The first 
and foremost of these is that by the very nature of the methods used in 
the preparation of these compounds, i.e. the initial alkylation step 
involving (in most cases, but not all) the reaction of a polyolefin 
with maleic anhydride, or the subsequent condensation reaction between 
the resulting alkyl or alkenyl substituted succinic anhydride and a 
polyamine to produce the succinimide, the products produced in each 
step will usually be a mixture of compounds, and will usually be used 
as such, either in the subsequent reaction with the
