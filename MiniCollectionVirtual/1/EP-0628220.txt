<ABSTRACT>
A grounding spring is provided for discharging static electricity on a card as the card is inserted into an electronic device and for therafter grounding the card, which minimizes electromagnetic radiation during electrostatic discharge in a simple and easily mounted construction. The grounding spring (60, Fig. 3) is formed of sheet metal and has a card-engaging part (64) lying within a recess of a card-guiding track (72). The grounding spring has a downwardly extending leg (90) that extends down into a hole (92) of a circuit board lying under the card-receiving mechanism, and has a substantially 180 DEG  loop (112) connecting the card-engaging part to the downward leg.

<DESCRIPTION>
Memory cards commonly include a circuit board 
that holds integrated circuits, and a connector at the 
front of the card for connecting to a corresponding 
connector in an electronic device that receives the card. 
Standard JEIDA cards have a thickness of five 
millimeters, which enables them to be inserted into thin 
electronic devices. The cards can hold a considerable static charge 
having a potential of ten thousand volts or more, which 
should be dissipated prior to mating of signal contacts 
of the card and device. Memory cards are currently 
provided with grounding contacts as well as signal 
contacts at the front of the card, but there is danger 
that a static discharge can occur between signal contacts 
prior to mating of the grounding contacts. A static 
discharge system which provides early discharge of static 
electricity from a memory card, in a construction that 
minimizes the effects of an electromagnetic pulse created 
during sudden discharge, is known from EP-A- 328 077. In accordance with one embodiment of the 
present invention, a combination card and card-receiving 
electronic device is provided, which assures early 
discharge of static electricity on the card and 
thereafter keeps the rear portion of the card grounded, 
in a design that minimizes adverse effects of the rapid 
static electricity discharge, in a low cost and reliable 
construction. The electronic device includes a card-receiving 
mechanism having a pair of horizontally-extending 
tracks for guiding the card into the device. 
A grounding spring is provided which includes a card-contacting 
part positioned along one of the guide track,  
 
and a downwardly-extending leg whose lower part is 
connected to a ground plane of a circuit board lying 
directly under the card-receiving mechanism. The first 
track has a track hole, and the grounding spring has a 
substantially 180° loop extending around one edge of the 
track hole, with one side of the loop connected to the 
card-engaging part and the other side of the loop 
connected to the top of the leg. The novel features of the invention are set 
forth with particularity in the characterising portions of the appended claims. The 
invention will be best understood from the following 
description when read in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is an isometric view of a memory card 
and an electronic device in the form of a lap top 
computer, constructed in accordance with the present 
invention. Fig. 2 is a sectional top view of the memory 
card and a portion
