<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
laser, and more particularly to a semiconductor laser having 
an excellent conversion efficiency. Optical fiber communications have spread from large 
capacity trunk systems to subscriber systems. Low cost 
systems are essential for subscriber optical fiber 
communications. As a light source, a Peltier-free system 
which requires no cooler is desired. From this viewpoint, a semiconductor laser has long 
been desired which can emit a sufficiently large light output 
at a low drive current even at a high temperature of near 85 
°C. It is therefore necessary to raise a characteristic 
temperature of a semiconductor laser sufficiently high because 
the characteristic temperature governs the temperature 
characteristics of the semiconductor laser. Semiconductor lasers have been fabricated heretofore 
on a GaAs substrate or an InP substrate. Semiconductor lasers 
for optical fiber communications are required to have an 
emitted light wavelength of a 1.3 µm band or 1.55 µm band 
(collectively called 1 µm band) at which an optical fiber has  
 
less loss. Light emission of the 1 µm band cannot be obtained 
by a semiconductor laser which uses an epitaxial layer 
lattice-matching and formed on a GaAs substrate. InP 
substrates have been used therefore for semiconductor lasers 
of the 1 µm band. A typical semiconductor laser of the 1 µm band uses 
InGaAsP/InP based materials utilizing an InP substrate and 
InGaAsP active layer. It is desired to form a clad layer 
having a wide band gap in order to confine carriers in and 
near an active layer. InP has been used because this material 
has the widest band gap among group III-V compound 
semiconductors which lattice-match an InP substrate. A guide layer (light waveguide layer, barrier layer) 
for confining light in and near the active layer is interposed 
between the clad layer and active layer. As the guide layer, 
InGaAsP having a wider band gap than the active layer has been 
used. However, a characteristic temperature of such an 
InGaAsP/InP semiconductor laser is about 60 K and steeply 
lowers its light output at a high temperature. Depending on materials having relatively narrow and 
wide band gaps used to form a potential barrier between the 
active layer and barrier layer, a ratio (ΔEc/ΔEv) of a band 
discontinuity (ΔEc) between conduction bands to a band 
discontinuity (ΔEv) between valence bands changes.  
 The effective mass of an electron is lighter than a 
hole. It is therefore desired that ΔEc is larger
