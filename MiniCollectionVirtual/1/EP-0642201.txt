<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-voltage, direct-current transmission system (2) for coupling two networks (4, 6) which are at very different frequencies (f2 and f1) and have a number of phases. According to the invention, a rejection circuit (26) for characteristic harmonic currents of relatively low order is arranged in the DC intermediate circuit (12). The interaction between the two networks (4, 6) can thus be considerably reduced.
