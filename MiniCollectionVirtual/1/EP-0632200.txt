<ABSTRACT>
In this drive mechanism, a swash plate 13 is in sectional contact with the side walls 8, 9 of a delivery cavity 12 and adjoins the latter in a sealing manner. By virtue of this arrangement, delivery chambers are formed which are independent of one another. The swash plate 13 is moved about a wobble point by a swash plate shaft 1 which is arranged obliquely with respect to a drive shaft 2. In order to achieve even contact of the swash plate 13 with the side walls 8, 9, and to avoid stresses as a result of geometric inaccuracy or rolling over foreign bodies, the swash plate shaft 1 is linked movably to the drive shaft 2, so that the tilted position of the swash plate can be varied, and is displaced, into the most extreme oblique position possible, by one or more spring elements 18 which on the one hand bear on the swash plate shaft 1 and on the other hand on the drive shaft 2.

Drive device for a swash plate machine, in which 
a swash plate (13) is brought partially into contact with 

the side walls (8, 9) of a delivery chamber (12) and 
bears sealingly against the latter, with the result that 

mutually independent delivery chambers are produced, and 
in which the swash plate (13) is moved about a wobble 

point (3) by a swash plate shaft (1) positioned obliquely 
relative to a drive shaft (2), the swash plate shaft (1) 

being deflected, by one or more spring elements (18) 
which are supported on the swash plate shaft (1), on the 

one hand, and on the drive shaft (2), on the other hand, 
into an extreme oblique position in which one end of the 

swash plate shaft is supported in a bearing part (16) at 
the end of the drive shaft (2), the bearing part (16) 

being guided, in a fashion capable of movement in the 
radial direction of the drive shaft (2), by a positive 

connection between side walls (2a, 2b) at the end of the 
drive shaft (2) and opposite faces of the bearing part 

(16) on the drive shaft (2), and being connected to the 
drive shaft (2) in a fashion secure against rotation in 

the direction of the rotary movement of said drive shaft, 
and the spring element (18) being arranged between the 

bearing part (16) and drive shaft (2), characterized in 
that on its sides opposite the side walls (2a, 2b) at the 

end of the drive shaft (2) the bearing part (16), and one 
or both side walls (2a, 2b) cooperate via a connection 

with a groove (31), extending essentially in a direction 
perpendicular to the central axis of the swash plate 

shaft (1), and a bolt (32). 
Drive device according to Claim 1, characterized  
 

in that at its sides opposite the side walls (2a, 2b) at 
the end of the drive shaft the bearing part (16) is 

provided in each case with a groove (31) which extends 
essentially in the direction perpendicular to the central 

axis of the swash plate shaft (1), and in that one or 
both of the side walls (2a, 2b) respectively has/have a 

bolt (32) which engages in the groove (31). 
Drive device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that one or both side walls (2a, 2b) is/are provided 

with a groove (31) each, which extends essentially in a 
direction perpendicular to the central axis of the swash 

plate shaft (1), and in that on its sides opposite the 
side walls (2a, 2b) at the end of the drive shaft the 

bearing part (16) has a bolt (32) in each case which 
engages in the groove (31). 
Drive device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the groove (31) is constructed in 

the shape of an L and is arranged on the sides in such a 
way that there is a spacing from the upper edge and from 

the lower edge, the L being open in a direction opposite 
to the end face (33) 
of the bearing part.
