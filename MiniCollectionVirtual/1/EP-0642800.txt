<ABSTRACT>
An irrigation probe assembly is provided which can be 
used during-surgery. This instrument includes a hollow 

handle (12) connected to a hollow probe tip (26). The probe tip 
includes at or near its distal end one or more openings (36) 

through which the irrigating fluid is drained from or 
released into the subject. The distal end of the probe tip 

may be bent to improve the instrument's ability to be 
manipulated after insertion into the surgical site. The 

proximal end (14) of the probe tip is inserted into the handle 
and is connected to a fluid line (18). A flow regulator (40) is 

included in the handle portion which, when operated, 
selectively restricts the flow of irrigating fluid through 

the instrument and out of or into the surgical site.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to probes used 
during surgery. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to surgical probes used during operations requiring 
concurrent probing and irrigating. The present invention 
is particularly, although not exclusively, useful for 
probing and irrigating the surgical site of a patient 
during endoscopic surgery. Modern surgical procedures attempt to minimize the 
invasive aspects of surgery. This is the result of the 
widely accepted belief that patient discomfort, overall 
recovery time, as well as the likelihood of post-surgical 
complications are generally proportional to the 
invasiveness of the particular procedure. One way to reduce the invasiveness of relatively 
simple surgical procedures such as exploratory surgery is 
through the use of endoscopes. Endoscopy is a surgical 
procedure where a thin scope is placed into the person 
being examined. Some specific examples include 
laparoscopy, where a scope is placed into the abdominal 
cavity, esophascopy, where the scope is placed into the 
esophagus, and arthroscopy, where the scope is placed into 
a joint. Using endoscopes, the surgeon is able to view the 
interior of the person's body without the necessity of 
making a large incision. Instead, the endoscope, which 
includes a thin, insertable probe, requires only a small 
incision or hole into which the probe is inserted. It is 
the reduced trauma at the entry point which results in the 
reduced recovery time and reduced post-surgical 
complications such as infections or ruptured suture lines. 
Reduced trauma results because both the skin and the 
musculature are only minimally disturbed.  The rapidly expanding uses for endoscopy require new 
types of support instruments which, like the endoscope, are 
minimally invasive. For example, in an arthroscopy 
procedure which seeks to allow a surgeon to inspect a 
joint, the tip of the arthroscope is placed into the joint. 
The tip includes an optical viewing system such as a small 
remote camera lens. Often, the joint to be inspected is 
damaged and cartilage or tissue is displaced. Further, the 
injury and the entry of the scope itself can cause a 
modicum of bleeding within the joint or the tissue 
surrounding the joint. This displaced cartilage and 
localized bleeding can obscure the lens in the arthroscope, 
or otherwise conceal the areas to be examined, and prevent 
the surgeon from viewing the joint. Therefore, localized 
removal of blood or tissue fragments is desirable.

A device for probing and irrigating the interior of a being, said 
device comprising: 

   a handle having a fluid passageway; 
   a hollow irrigation probe tip formed with a lumen and having a 

proximal and a distal end, said proximal end of said irrigation probe tip 
being connectable to said fluid passageway, and said distal end of said 

probe tip being shaped to enter and probe the interior of the being; 
   at least one opening in said irrigation probe tip for allowing flow 

of the fluid through said probe tip; and 
   flow regulation means attached to said handle for regulating flow 

of the fluid through said fluid passageway. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein said handle is formed with 
a longitudinal bore therethrough and said fluid passageway is at least 

partially located in said longitudinal bore of said handle. 
The device according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said distal end of said 
irrigation probe tip is bent to facilitate probing. 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein said 
opening in said probe tip is an
 opening at an extremity of said tip, with 
said opening allowing the fluid in said lumen to flow through said probe 

tip at said extremity. 
The device according to claim 1 wherein said distal end of said 
probe tip forms a solid extremity and said opening in said probe tip is a 

lateral opening through a portion of said probe tip other than said 
extremity, said lateral opening allowing the fluid in said lumen to flow 

 
through said probe tip. 
The device according to any one the preceding claims wherein said 
flow regulating means comprises a valve. 
The device according to any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising a flow tube through said fluid passageway wherein said flow 

regulating means selectively collapses said flow tube to restrict flow of the 
fluid through said flow tube. 
The device according to claim 7 wherein said flow regulating means 
comprises a flow restrictor slidably retained in a recess in said handle. 
The device according to claim 8 wherein said flow restrictor is 
attached to a button allowing an operator of said device to collapse said 

flow tube and restrict fluid flow through said fluid passageway. 
The device according to claim 9 wherein said flow restrictor is 
formed with an annular ridge, said annular ridge cooperatively engaging 

an annular retainer in said recess to retain said flow restrictor in said 
recess. 
The device according to claim 9 wherein said flow restrictor 
includes a threaded portion and said recess is formed with a threaded 

flange through which said threaded portion of said flow restrictor is 
threaded, said flow restrictor being slidably retained in said recess by 

cooperative engagement between said threaded portion and said flange. 
The device according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
said probe tip is attachable to a probe connector at least partially inserted 

 
into said handle. 
The device according to claim 12 wherein said proximal end of said 
probe tip is threaded into a collar rotatably attached to said probe 

connector, said collar cooperatively maintaining said probe tip in contact 
with said probe connector to establish a seal between said probe tip and 

said probe connector. 
The device according to claim 13 further comprising at least one 
o-ring between said handle and said probe connector to establish a seal 

therebetween.
