<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to electronic keys of the "chip" type and to connectors intended for functioning with these keys. It involves providing a locking groove (402) located on the face of the key opposite that supporting the chip, in an intermediate position between this chip and the front end of the key. The locking means (402) of the lock therefore press the key towards the connection means (201) which are located above the key. In this way, play is eliminated and the soiling of the contacts is avoided. It makes it possible to use the known standard chip cards for the chip and its connection means.
