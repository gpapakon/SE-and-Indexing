<ABSTRACT>
Construction assembly for construction of three-dimensional structures with three basic elements which are in each case present in numbers, namely     - bodies (1) with at least one bore (1a) - connecting bars (2) which fit into the bores (1a) of the bodies (1) and - distance sleeves (3) which can be pushed onto the connecting bars (2) for fixing the mutual distance of the bodies (1) along the connecting bars (2).

A building set for the erection of three-dimensional structures 
comprising basic elements of which there are provided respective 

pluralities, namely first basic elements comprising bodies (1) with at 
least one bore (1a), and second basic elements comprising connecting 

bars (2) which fit into the bores (1a) in the bodies (1), characterised 
in that there are provided third basic elements comprising spacer 

sleeves (3) which can be pushed onto the connecting bars (2) for fixing 
the mutual spacing of the bodies (1) along the connecting bars (2). 
A building set according to claim 1 characterised in that at 
least some of the bodies (1) have passing therethrough at least one 

respective continuous bore (1a) and preferably a respective plurality 
thereof. 
A building set according to claim 2 characterised in that bores 
(1a) in a body (1) include an angle, preferably 90Â°, relative to each 

other, and extend past each other in the body (1). 
A building set according to one of claim 1 to 3 characterised 
in that the bores (1a) in the bodies (1) have at least at one end of the 

bores (1a) a region (1b) which is of enlarged diameter and into which 
the connecting bars (2) can be preferably clampingly inserted. 
A building set according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
enlarged region (1a) has an outwardly conically enlarged portion (1c). 
A building set according to claim 4 or claim 5 characterised in 
that the bores (1a) in the interior of the body (1) have a region which 

is enlarged relative to the bore diameter at the surface of the body, 
preferably in the form of a peripheral groove (7).  

 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised 
in that at least some of the bodies (1) are substantially convex and are 

preferably parallelepipeds or balls. 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that the connecting bars (2) fit accurately with a small clearance 

into the bores (1a) in the bodies (1) and are displaceable and rotatable 
loosely therein. 
A building set according to claim 8 characterised by means for 
restraining or preventing displacement and/or rotation of a connecting 

bar in the body. 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised 

in that at least some of the connecting bars (2) have a peripheral 
groove (5) at the end region. 
A building set according to claim 6, claim 9 and claim 10 
characterised in that there are provided preferably annular holding 

elements (6) which by simultaneous engagement into the peripheral groove 
(5) of a connecting bar (2) on the one hand and an enlarged region (7) 

in the bore (1a) in a body (1) on the other hand restrain axial 
displacement of the connecting bar (2) in the body (1). 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised 
in that at least some of the connecting bars (2) have a slot-shaped 

opening (4) at the end region. 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised 
in that there are provided means for connecting two connecting bars. 
A building set according to claim 13 characterised in that said  
 

means include a connecting body which can be fitted into bores, which 
extend from the ends of the connecting bars, of two connecting bars to 

be connected together. 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised 
in that the preferably hollow-cylindrical spacer sleeves (3) surround 

the preferably also cylindrical connecting bars (2), bearing snugly 
thereagainst but loosely displaceably relative to each other. 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised 
in that at least some of the spacer sleeves (3) are conically 

convergent at the end (3a). 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 16 characterised 
in that at least some of the spacer sleeves (3) have at the end at least 

one longitudinal slot (3b). 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 17 characterised 
in that at least some of the spacer sleeves (3) have one or more grooves 

(3c) in the outside surfaces. 
A building set according to claim 18 characterised in that the 
grooves (3c) extend axially and there are provided plates (11) which can 

be axially inserted into the grooves (3c). 
A building set according to one of claims 1 to 19 characterised 
in that there are provided connecting bars (2) and/or spacer sleeves (3) 

of different lengths. 
Use of the building set according to one of claims 1 to 20 as a 
toy and/or for the erection of shelf assemblies, stands, scaffolding 

frameworks or the like.  
 
Body, connecting bar or spacer sleeve of a building set 
according to one of claims 1 to 20. 
Three-dimensional structure erected with a building set 
according to one of claims 1 to 20.
