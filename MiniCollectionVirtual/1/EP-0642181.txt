<ABSTRACT>
The magnetoresistive component includes a magnetoresistive strip of multi-layer type folded into a repeated geometric pattern (7a, 7b), in such a way as to exhibit at least one series of substantially parallel segments (7a, 7b), making it possible to reduce the demagnetising fields, the magneto-resistive strip (2) being formed by a stack (13) of layers (14) of a magnetic metallic material, separated by layers (15) of a non-magnetic metallic material. The component according to the invention applies to a sensor intended to read information recorded in magnetic form, or for detecting weak magnetic fields.
