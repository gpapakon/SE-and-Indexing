<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a stereoscopic image 
apparatus for calculating the position and the height of the 

stereoscopic model taken on a stereoscopic pair by viewing the 
stereoscopic pair three-dimensionally, and more particularly to a 

stereoscopic image apparatus wherein even when stereoscopic pairs 
different in size are used, the imaging distance can be kept 

constant, and the operability of the adjustment of the interval 
between a pair of marker sections is improved. 
In the present invention, the lines of observation sights 
from stereoscopic photos are reflected by first mirrors, and the 

lines of observation sights reflected by the first mirrors are 
led by second mirrors into imaging lens sections where a 

stereoscopic image is formed. The first mirrors can be moved 
generally along parabolas whose focuses are located in the 

positions where the second mirrors are placed, so that the 
imaging distance can be kept constant at all times. 
In the present invention, marker sections are arranged in 
the direction in which a pair of imaging lens sections are 

arranged, and since, along with the rotation of a handle that is 
rotated about an axis parallel with the optical axis of the 

imaging optical system, the marker sections can be moved away 

from each other or closer together by the same distance, the 
moving operation of said markers can be effected by the handle 

orthogonal to the direction of the movement of the markers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stereoscopic image 
apparatus for calculating the position and the height of the 
stereoscopic model taken on a stereoscopic pair by viewing the 
stereoscopic pair three-dimensionally, and more particularly to a 
stereoscopic image apparatus wherein even when stereoscopic pairs 
different in size are used, the imaging distance is kept 
constant. Further, the present invention relates to a stereoscopic 
image apparatus improved in operability of the adjustment of the 
interval between a pair of marker sections. As prior stereoscopic image apparatus, for example, a 
reflective type stereoscope 1000 shown in Fig. 7 or the like is 
used. The reflective type stereoscope 1000 is constituted such 
that each of the lines of observation sights is bent at a right 
angle by a pair of a reflector and a prism, and a stereoscopic 
image is formed by eyepiece lenses. After a stereoscopic pair 
is fixed, the stereoscope is moved to carry out the intended 
stereoscopy. Then, parallax differences are measured by using a 
parallax measuring lever equipped with a pair of cursors to 
measure specific heights and the like. The adjustment of the 
interval between the pair of cursors is carried out in such a way 
that rotating shafts which are threaded reversely to each other  
 
are extended through two cursor sections, and the rotating shafts 
are rotated about their axes thereby adjusting the interval 
between the right and left cursors. However, in the above prior reflective type stereoscope, 
renewal setting is required when photographs different in size 
are viewed three-dimensionally. The reflective type stereoscope 
is accompanied by a problem that since the focus adjustment must 
be repeated to correspond to the sizes of photographs, and the 
state of the observation changes inevitably, it is quite 
difficult to handle. Particularly, since the stereoscopy of 
stereoscopic pairs requires skill, the repeated readjustment 
imposes a needless burden on the user, and increases a sense of 
fatigue of the user, thereby causing a problem, that is, a 
measurement error. Further, in the above prior stereoscopic image apparatus, 
since the adjustment of the interval between the pair of right 
and left cursors is carried out by rotating the rotating shafts 
about their axes, there is a problem that the operability is 
quite poor. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
stereoscopic image apparatus that is easy to handle and wherein 
when the size of photographs is changed, the
