<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a unit dose medication container (10) comprising a plurality of separate and individual pod members (11) in which unit doses of medication (14) can be placed. The pod members (11) are interconnected by a breakable bridge (12) to form an integral medication container unit (10). One or more pod members can be removed from the container unit (10) by manually rotating one pod member (11) with respect to an adjacent pod member (11) until the bridge (12) connecting them is broken.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSEPARABLE UNIT DOSE MEDICATION CONTAINERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In many hospitals and health care facilities, it is common practice to prepare medications for subsequent administration to patients by manually removing unit doses of prescribed medication for a patient from a bottle, vial or other container and placing these doses in separate containers; e.g., a paper cup, pre-designated for a patient. When a pre-designated container carrying a patient's unit doses of medication are delivered to that patient, the patient, or an attendant, must then manually remove the unit doses and either the patient self-administers the medication doses or the attendant assists in the administration of the 

medication. In many instances, a plurality of containers carrying unit doses of different medication for several patients are placed on a tray or other- conveyance for delivery to the patients. Although each patient's doses of medication are placed in separate containers each designated for a particular patient, mix-ups do occur. Sometimes one patient receives medication prescribed and intended for another or one patient will receive too much medication while another does not receive enough. In addition, manual handling of the unit doses of medication by the attendant and/or the patient can subject the medication to contamination that may be harmful to the patient.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt has now been found that by using the separable unit dose medication container of the invention that unit doses of medication prescribed and intended for a particular patient can be delivered to that patient without the need for either an attendant or the patient to manually handle the medication itself thereby preserving the integrity of the medication. It has also been found that use of the separable unit dose medication container of the invention minimizes the accidental administration of too much or too little medication to a patient and also minimizes the accidental administration of the wrong medication to a patient. - In general, the separable unit dose medication container of the invention comprises a plurality of separate and individual unit dose medication pods which are horizontally aligned adjacent to each other, each of said adjacent pods 

being joined together by a breakable bridge to form an elongated, integral container unit. Each of the pods carries a unit dose of medication and is provided with means such as a peelably removable tab to access the medication.The geometric form of the

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A separable unit dose medication container comprising; (a) a plurality of individual and separate medication pods, each of said pods
'
 having a cavity formed therein adapted to receive a unit dose of medication;
(b) peelably removable tab means overlying each of said cavities; and,
(c) a manually breakable bridge member interconnecting and joining said pods together to form an elongated, integral medication container.
2. The medication container of Claim 1 wherein the geometric form of said pbds is rectangular.
3. The medication container of Claim 1 wherein the geometric shape of said breakable bridge member is in the form of a. cross.
. 4. The medication container of Claim 1 wherein said plurality of pods collectively contain an amount of medication sufficient to supply said medication to a patient over a pre-determined period of time.
