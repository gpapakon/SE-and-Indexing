<ABSTRACT>
The ultrasonic sensor 10 comprises an ultrasonic transmitter 11 for 
generating ultrasonic wave, a drive circuit 12 for providing said transmitter 

with drive signals, an ultrasonic receiver 13 for receiving ultrasonic wave 
which is generated from the transmitter and then reflected on a surface of an 

object and for converting the received ultrasonic wave into electric signals, 
and a judgment circuit 14 for comparing output from the receiver. The level 

setting means provided in the judgment circuit 14 determines a initial reference 
level in response to the output of the ultrasonic receiver and provides a 

further reference level when the output of the ultrasonic receiver does not 
conform to the initial reference level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to unauthorized intrusion detection, in particular
an ultrasonic sensor capable of varying a reference level used to produce
required information from sensed ultrasonic signals.For example, Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 3-61149 discloses an anti-theft
device for driving an alarm device upon unauthorized opening of a lid in
its closed condition. The anti-theft device of this type comprises a detection
switch for detecting operation of a door, an alarm device, an alarm
control circuit to operate the alarm device upon receiving a sensing signal
from the detection switch. Preferably, the alarm device includes horn or
headlights in a vehicle. Usually, the alarm control circuit is operable to
change its mode to any of three armed, disarmed and alarming conditions. In
the armed condition, the alarm control circuit may receive the sensing signal
from the detection switch and thereby forward a drive signal to the alarm
device. In the disarmed condition, the alarm control circuit can produce no
drive signal for the alarm device. In the alarm condition, the control
circuit continues to generate the drive signal so that the alarm device is
successively operated for a certain period of time, for example three minutes.
In some cases, an indicator for representing the armed condition is provided
to produce blinking light by output of the alarm control circuit.U.S. Patent No. 3,781,854 discloses a warning control circuit for automobiles
wherein it is switched from disarmed to armed condition when all doors
and lids are closed and locked by operation of cylinder lock devices. If
there is a case of unauthorized opening of one of the doors, trunk rid or hood 
of the automobile in the armed condition, the control circuit automatically
drives the warning device which therefore produces warning sound and light for
anti-theft.Also, known for example as shown by Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 62-98280
is ultrasonic detection means for detecting movement of an object utilizing
ultrasonic wave which comprises an ultrasonic transmitter for generating
ultrasonic wave; an ultrasonic receiver for receiving ultrasonic wave
which is reflected on a surface of the object after emission from the transmitter;
and a detecting circuit for extracting change in output signals of the
receiver.Now, there has been proposed an anti-theft device provided with an
ultrasonic detecting sensor to detect unauthorized intrusion into interior of
the automobile after break of window glass. The anti-theft device of this
type

<CLAIMS>
An ultrasonic sensor comprising an ultrasonic transmitter (11) for generating
ultrasonic wave; a drive circuit (12) for providing said transmitter (11) with drive

signals; an ultrasonic receiver (13) for receiving ultrasonic wave which is generated
from the transmitter (11) and then reflected on a surface of an object and for

converting the received ultrasonic wave into electric signals; a judgment circuit (14)
for comparing output from the receiver (13) with a reference level to generate an

output when the output from the receiver (13) is higher than the reference level; and a
control circuit (15) for forwarding drive signals to the transmitter (11) and for

receiving output from said judgment circuit (14), said control circuit (15) comprising
level setting means for determining a first reference level in response to the output of

the ultrasonic receiver (13) and for varying the reference level to a second reference
level when the output of the ultrasonic receiver (13) does not conform to the first

reference level; and characterised in that

said control circuit (15) comprises a first timer for generating a first pulse of
long pulse width to activate said drive circuit (12), a second timer for generating a

second pulse to activate said drive circuit (12), said second pulse having a shorter
pulse width than that of the first pulse generated by said first timer,
said ultrasonic transmitter (11) being activated through said drive circuit (12)
by the second pulse generated when said second timer is intermittently activated

several times after said first timer is activated,
and wherein when said ultrasonic receiver (13) receives said first pulse from 
said first timer, said control circuit (15) shifts said first reference level to said second

reference level (step 49),
and when said control circuit (15) receives an output from said judgment
circuit (14), said control circuit (15) shifts said second timer to said first timer for

ultrasonic transmission and reception (step 60),
and when said ultrasonic receiver (13) receives said first pulse and the
frequency of the received ultrasonic wave is out of the predetermined range, said

control circuit (15) is changed from armed condition to warning condition (step 44).
An ultrasonic sensor of claim 1, wherein the pulse width of the firs pulse
generated by said first timer is 800 msec, and the pulse width of the second pulse

generated by said second timer is 200 msec.
An ultrasonic sensor of claim 1 or 2, wherein said control circuit (15) has a
third timer for generating a third pulse having a pulse width shorter than that of the

second pulse generated by said second timer,

said third timer generating said third pulse when said first or second timer
generates said first or second pulse so that said control circuit (15) cancels signals

received by said ultrasonic receiver during occurrence of said third pulse.
An ultrasonic sensor as claimed in claim 3, wherein the pulse width of said
third pulse generated by said third timer is 100 msec.
