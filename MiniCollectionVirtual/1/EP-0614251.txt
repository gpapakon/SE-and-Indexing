<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a brush assembly structure for a 
motor arranged as described below. A brush holder 23 

is integrally formed to substantially a C-shape so 
that the extreme ends of the opposite leg portions 

23b, 23c of the brush holder 23 confront the opposite 
side positions of a commutator 10 in the diametrical 

direction thereof, and brush accommodation units 24, 
25 are formed at the extreme ends of the opposite leg 

portions. Further, brush springs 13, 14 are attached 
to the cylindrical bottom portion 9b of a holder stay 

unit and the brush springs elastically depress brushes 
26, 27 accommodated in the brush accommodation units 

at the moment when the brushes 26, 27 reach the 
positions of the commutator which correspond to the 

brush accommodation units. 
With this arrangement, when the brush holder 
having the brushes assembled thereto is assembled to 

the holder stay unit, the brushes can be protected and 
an assembly job can be simplified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brush assembly 
structure for a motor used to operate, for example, 
electric parts of an automobile. In general, this kind of brush assembly is 
mounted so that it can come into elastically sliding 
contact with the commutator formed on an armature 
shaft. As a result, when no commutator is present, 
the brushes project towards the center of the shaft 
beyond the position of the sliding surface of the 
commutator. Therefore, if an attempt is made to 
assemble the armature when the brushes project towards 
the assembly of the motor, the armature cannot be 
substantially assembled because it is blocked by the 
brushes. To cope with this problem, there is a known 
method in which each brush is tentatively held against 
a spring at a position spaced apart from a commutator. 
The armature is assembled in this state and then the 
tentatively held brush is released. In this case, an 
operation for tentatively holding each brush and an 
operation for releasing the tentatively held brush are 
needed. These operations are time-consuming and 
troublesome and there is a possibility that the 
releasing operation may be forgotten sometimes. Consequently, as disclosed in Japanese Utility 
Model Unexamined Publication No. Sho 58-115862 and 
Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. Sho 
58-166262, there is proposed a method by which a brush 
unit having brushes preset in a brush holder is 
prepared, an opening is formed to a holder stay unit 
to which the brush holder is to be mounted and then  
 
the brush unit is assembled through the opening after 
an armature has been preassembled. In the former 
Publication, however, since brush units must be formed 
for respective brushes and engaged and assembled, 
respectively, as many brush units as many as brushes 
are necessary and thus the number of parts is 
increased and workability is lowered. Further, since 
the brush is urged to the state that it projects 
significantly from the brush unit by a spring 
assembled in the brush unit, a problem arises in that 
the brush can strike other parts and is liable to be 
damaged by them before the brush unit is assembled to 
the holder stay unit, and the like. On the other hand, in the latter Publication, 
since a pair of brushes are assembled in a brush unit, 
there is an advantage that the number of brush units 
can be reduced to half those of the former 
Publication. In this case, however, since a brush 
accommodation unit is not used, each brush is urged 
and held in the state that
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A motor having a pair of brushes (26, 27) 
which are accommodated in a pair of brush 

accommodation units (24, 25) formed to a brush holder 
(23) so that they can emerge from and retract into the 

brush accommodation units, respectively, and come into 
elastic sliding contact with the opposite side 

positions of a commutator (10) supported by a casing 
(2) in the diametrical direction thereof, said brush 

holder (23) being formed to substantially a C-shape in 
such that the extreme ends of the opposite leg 

portions (23b, 23c) of said brush holder confront the 
opposite side positions of said commutator, said brush 

accommodation units (24, 25) being formed at each end 
of said opposite leg portions, said brush 

accommodation units having opposing open ends for 
allowing the brushes (26, 27) to emerge from a retract 

into the brush accommodation unit, a holder stay unit 
(9) being provided on the casing (2) so that the brush 

holder can be attached to the holder stay unit in the 
diemetrical direction,
 
   characterised in that supporting springs (13, 14) 

for elastically depressing said brushes (26, 27) are 
provided on said holder stay unit, said springs being 

arranged so that they become elastically deformed in 
accordance with the movements of said brush 

accommodation unit when it is inserted into the 
mounting position and elastically depressing said 

brushes (26, 27) accommodated in said brush 
accommodation unit at the moment when said brush 

accommodation unit reaches the mounting position and 
at the same time said springs reach the outer open 

ends of said brush accommodation unit.
