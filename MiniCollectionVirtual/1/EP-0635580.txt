<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nitrogen-containing 
sintered hard alloy which possesses excellent thermal shock 
resistance, wear resistance and toughness and which shows 
exceptionally favorable properties when used as a material 
for cutting tools. There are already known cutting tools that are formed 
of a nitrogen-containing sintered hard alloy having hard 
phases of carbonitrides or the like composed mainly of Ti 
and bonded together through a metal phase made up of Ni and 
Co. Such a nitrogen-containing sintered hard alloy is 
extremely small in particle size of the hard phases 
compared to a conventional sintered hard alloy that 
contains no nitrogen, so that it shows much improved high-temperature 
creep resistance. Because of this favorable 
property, this material has been used for cutting tools as 
widely as what is known as cemented carbides, which are 
composed mainly of WC. But nitrogen-containing sintered hard alloys are low  
 
in thermal shock resistance. This is because (1) its main 
component, Ti carbonitride, is extremely low in thermal 
conductivity compared to WC, the main component of a 
cemented carbide, so that the thermal conductivity as the 
entire alloy is about half that of a cemented carbide, and 
(2) its thermal expansion coefficient, which also largely 
depends upon that of main component, is 1.3 times that of a 
cemented carbide. Therefore, cutting tools made of such an 
alloy have not been used with reliability under conditions 
where the tools are subjected to severe thermal shocks such 
as for milling, lathing of square materials or for wet copy 
cutting where the depth of cut changes widely. The present inventors have analyzed various phenomena 
associated with cutting operations such as the temperature 
and stress distributions in cutting tools in different 
cutting types and studied the relation between such 
phenomena and the arrangement of components in the tool. 
As a result, they achieved the following findings. A 
cemented carbide, which has a high thermal conductivity, is 
less likely to heat up because the heat produced at the 
tool surface during cutting diffuses quickly through the 
tool body. Also, due to its low thermal expansion 
coefficient, tensile stresses are less likely to be 
produced and remain at the surface area even if the tool 
begins idling abruptly or the high-temperature portion is  
 
brought into contact with a water-soluble cutting oil and 
thus is cooled sharply. In contrast, nitrogen-containing sintered hard alloys 
composed mainly of Ti
