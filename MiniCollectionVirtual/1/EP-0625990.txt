<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the area of molecular biology/biochemistry and presents a
purified glycoprotein that binds to the human lectin Mac-2, and would play an
important role in interaction events at cell surfaces, DNA sequences that encode the
protein, and expression systems for expressing it. The protein has a variety of medical
applications involving the regulation of cell surface interactions relating to immune
responses, pathogen/host cell interactions, metastasis, and cell adhesion and migration,
and developmental functions such as pre-antibody immunity.Cell surface molecules play a key role in the infectivity of viruses and other
pathogens with their target cells. For example, ICAM-1, the endothelial cell receptor
for integrin binding, is also the receptor for rhinovirus binding. Rhinoviruses are
members of the picornavirus family and are responsible for about 50% of common
colds in humans. Another classic example of such interactions is influenza
hemagglutinin, a lectin that binds to sialic acid on its host cell as the first step in
infection. Thus, a prophylactic approach to preventing the common cold is to interfere
with the binding of rhinovirus to cell-bound ICAM-1 by administration of soluble
binding competitors to the host receptor.Lectins are a class of proteins that bind carbohydrates specifically and
noncovalently. Lis, H. and Sharon, N., 1986, Annual Review of Biochemistry,
55:35. Numerous lectins have been identified in higher animals, both membrane-bound
and soluble, and have been implicated in a variety of cell-recognition
phenomena, in addition to roles that they play in metastasis.Lectins may generally be classified as either of the C-type, whose binding
properties are calcium-dependent and which are structurally related to the
asialoglycoprotein receptor, or the S-type, or thiol-dependent lectin. It should be
noted, however, that there are other proteins with lectin properties that apparently do
not fall into either of these classes, such as for example, fibronectin and laminin.
Drickamar, K., 1988, J.Biol.Chem., 263:9557.Lectins are thought to play a role in regulating cellular events that are initiated at
the level of the plasma membrane. For instance, plasma membrane associated
molecules are involved in the activation of various subsets of lymphoid cells,
particularly T-lymphocytes, and it is known that cell-surface molecules are responsible
for activation of these cells and consequently their response during an immune reaction.
This phenomenon has been studied using various
