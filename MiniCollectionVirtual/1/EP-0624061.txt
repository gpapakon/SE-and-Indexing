<DESCRIPTION>
 Composite frozen confectionsThe present invention relates to a composite frozen confection, shaped as a bar and comprising materials of different texture and taste.Frozen confections comprising ice cream, couverture and a chewy confection material like fudge and toffee in a bar shape are well known in the art and have been on sale for many years.In the present specification, the term "ice cream" not only comprises ice confection material made with cream, milk fat or any other animal or vegetable fat, for example ice milks, frozen yoghurts and frozen custards, but also any other aerated frozen confection material such as mollorine, milk ice and such like products comprising sugar substitute and/or fat substitutes.The term "couverture" comprises chocolate, milk chocolate, mock chocolate, white chocolate, fat coatings and similar confectionery products comprising fat substitutes."Bar products" and "bar shape" in this specification and claims are well-known terms in the frozen confection industry and refer to any oblong product for one person having about a rectangular base while the cross section may be rectangular, square, trapezoid, domes or roundish.
 An aim of the invention is to provide a bar-shaped, frozen confection having a high textural contrast and, as a result thereof, a different eating experience from the existing ones. The invention also seeks to provide products having a good keepability and being capable of an economic industrial production.The invention provides thereto a couverture-coated, bar-shaped, frozen confection comprising at least one layer of ice cream, at least one layer of chewy confection material and at least one continuous layer of a crisp confection material enrobed with a moisture barrier material.A particular feature of the invention is the positioning of the chewy layer on one surface of the ice cream component and the crisp layer on the opposite surface. This arrangement gives a particularly pleasant and enjoyable eating sensation as the bite passes through the chewy, ice cream and crisp layers in turn.For an increased crispness experience, preferably the layer of crisp confection material is composed of a plurality of crisp layers laminated with an adhesive confection material of low water activity, i.e. sufficiently low to prevent moisture from migrating from said adhesive confection material to the crisp layers, such as toffee, fudge, caramel and sugar paste.In a convenient embodiment as regards manufacture thereof, the moisture barrier coating is a couverture

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. Couverture-coated, barâ€”shaped, frozen confection comprising at least one layer of ice cream (4; 13) , at least one layer of chewy confection material (6; 15) and at least one continuous layer of a crisp confection material (1; 11) enrobed with a moisture barrier material (3; 12, 16) .
2. Confection according to Claim 1, wherein the layer of crisp confection material is composed of a plurality of crisp layers (1) laminated with an adhesive confection material (2) of low water activity.
3. Confection according to Claim 1, wherein the moisture barrier is a couverture.
4. A method of manufacturing a couverture-coated, bar-shaped, frozen confection product comprising coating at least one side of an oblong slab of crisp confection material (1) with a moisture barrier material (3) , putting this coated slab in contact with a piece (4) of ice cream of about the same length and width as the slab while arranging an adhesive material in between, applying at least one layer of chewy confection material (6) , either before or after combining the ice cream and the crisp slab, and finally enrobing the composite so obtained with couverture (7) .
5. The method of Claim 4, wherein the moisture barrier material (3) is a couverture.
6. The method of Claim 4 or 5, wherein the adhesive material is couverture while in a molten state.
7. The method of any Claims 4 to 6, wherein the ice cream (4) is coated with couverture (5) at least at the
SUBSTITUTESHEET

8. The method of manufacturing a couverture-coated, bar-shaped, frozen confection product, wherein a mould (17) is internally coated with couverture (16) , thereafter partly filled with a layer of ice cream (13) and at least one layer of chewy confection material (15) , a slab of crisp confection material (11) having a moisture barrier coaating (12) on at least the side to contact the ice cream is put in contact with the ice cream (13) and the open side of the mould is closed with couverture.
9. The method of any Claims 4 to 8, wherein the slab of crisp material is enrobed with couverture before contacting it with the ice cream.
10. The method of Claim 4 or 8, wherein the slab of crisp confection material is composed of a plurality of crisp layers (1) laminated with an adhesive confection material (2) of low water activity.
