<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of polyisobutylsuccinic anhydrides having a mean molar ratio between succinic anhydride groups and polyisobutyl groups of 1.05 : 1 to 1.3 : 1, which comprises reacting polyisobutene having a mean molecular weight Mw of 600 - 5000 and a content of terminal double bonds of at least 70 % with maleic anhydride in a maleic anhydride:polyisobutene molar ratio of from 1.05 : 1 to 3 : 1, at 160 - 210 DEG C in the presence of catalytic amounts of a dicarboxylic acid having 2 to 6 carbon atoms.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of polyisobutylsuccinic anhydrides
having an average molar ratio of succinic anhydride

groups to polyisobutyl groups of from 1.05 : 1 to 1.3 : 1,
wherein polyisobutene having an average molecular weight M
w

of 600 - 5000 and containing at least 70% of terminal double
bonds is reacted with maleic anhydride in a molar ratio of

maleic anhydride to polyisobutene of from 1.05 : 1 to 3 : 1
at 160 - 210Â°C in the presence of from 1 to 10 mol%, based on

polyisobutene, of a dicarboxylic acid of 2 to 6 carbon atoms.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the average molecular
weight M
w
 of the polyisobutene is from 800 to 1200.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the content of
terminal double bonds in the polyisobutene is 80 - 90%.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the dicarboxylic
acid used is oxalic acid.
