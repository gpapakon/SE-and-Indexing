<ABSTRACT>
The process of producing activated carbon includes 
steps of: combusting scrap tires containing metal wire 

at 400°C to 900°C under the presence of oxygen, carbon 
dioxide and water vapor;

 
reheating the generated combustible gases up to 800°C to 

900°C by adding a further fuel; causing the exhaust gas 
to heat-exchange with a water pipe boiler so that the 

temperature of the exhaust gas decreases to between 180°C and 250°C;
 

and introducing the exhaust having a temperature of 
180°C to 250°C into an electric dust collector so as to 

collect activated carbon. The particle size of the thus 
obtained motivated carbon is distributed substantially in a range 

of 90 to 
110 mesh and the CEC (cation exchange capacity) of the 

activated carbon falls within 30 to 40. 
The apparatus for producing it comprises an ash collecting room, the 
walls of which are constructed of a castable structure, a dry type dust 

collector of the inertial separation type (19) connected to an exhaust 
gas tube disposed in the rear portion of the furnace tubes inside the 

upper water chamber, an air blower connected to the lower combustion 
chamber and through a valve means with a tubular body for supplying 

water spray, and an electric dust collector between the exhaust gas tube 
and a chimney.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an activated 
carbon and a production process thereof, and more 
particularly, to an activated carbon, having a large 
cation exchange capacity (i.e., capacity of substituting 
bases, and to be referred to as CEC, hereinafter) and 
excellent in fertilizer retention and a production 
process thereof. Activated carbon is a porous carbonaceous substance 
having a large surface area and large adsorption ability 
and has a wide range of uses as an adsorbent for various 
purposes. Specifically, activated carbon can be used for 
adsorbing gases and vapors, recovering solvents, 
purifying and deodorizing gases, disposal of waste 
water, and decolorizing and purifying solutions. 
Further, activated carbon can be used as supports for 
catalysts. Activated carbons have been manufactured by  
 
treating wood or brown coal with an activating agent, 
e.g., zinc chloride, phosphoric acid and the like 
followed by dry distillation, alternatively, by 
activating charcoal with steam. For example, charcoal, 
coconut husk, and the like are sufficiently carbonized 
followed by a high temperature treatment by means of 
steam. Or the activated carbon is activated by soaking 
in zinc chloride and calcinated at a high temperature. The thus produced activated carbon typically has 
specific surface area of 800 to 1200 m2/g, pore volume of 
0.2 to 2 cm3/g and pore size of 1 to 4 nm. Activated carbon is mainly composed of carbon and 
includes small amounts of hydrogen, oxygen and inorganic 
components. With regard to the chemical structure, 
activated carbon is mainly composed of amorphous 
graphite and has functional groups such as hydroxy 
group, quinone group and the like on the surface. Meanwhile, a typical activated carbon has a CEC or 
a capacity of substituting bases of about 1 to 7. CEC 
is represented by milligram equivalent (ME), which is a 
figure of expressing what milligram equivalent of bases 
a 100g soil can retain, and CEC is used in the 
agriculture to indicate fertilizer retention ability in 
soil. That is, since, fertilizer components are 
generally composed of bases, the larger the CEC of soil,  
 
the more the soil can adsorb and retain fertilizer 
components. Therefore, the soil having a large CEC is 
capable of supplying fertilizers to crops continuously. Accordingly, by utilizing the adsorbability of 
activated carbons, some activated carbons have been 
tried to be used as a fertilizer retaining agent to be 
compounded in a soil together with fertilizers. 
Nevertheless, the
