<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for 
generating a continuous frequency sweep. The arrangement 

uses a number of interconnected oscillators VCO 1-4, each 
with its own frequency interval, which, together, can 

form a coherent interval. A frequency detector Φ is 
connected to each neighbouring pair of oscillators VCO 

1-4 in order to detect when the first oscillator in the 
pair has reached the same frequency as the second oscillator 

in the pair. The frequency detector Φ then generates 
a switch-over signal to respective sawtooth generators 

G and control units so that the next oscillator is 
connected to the output. The invention thus provides a 

continuous frequency sweep without any frequency notch on 
switch-over between the oscillators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement 
for generating a continuous frequency sweep. To be able 
to perform a continuous frequency sweep over a number of 
octaves, an oscillator is needed which can sweep a large 
range without interruption. This technique is needed 
inter alia for being able to measure transmission parameters 
in a microwave band. The present invention specifies 
an arrangement which uses oscillators which are 
coupled together and which, together, form a continuous 
frequency sweep. It has previously been known to couple together 
voltage-controlled oscillators in order to produce in 
this manner a wide sweep. Each oscillator has its frequency 
interval and the oscillators are coupled one after 
the other in turn. The oscillators are controlled at 
voltage intervals which are generated by sawtooth generators. 
Switching from one oscillator to the next has 
previously been carried out by using the end of the sweep 
voltage interval as criterion for shifting to the next 
oscillator. Due to the fact that the oscillators partially 
overlap one another's range, a notch occurs in the 
frequency sweep. The oscillators are also temperature-dependent, 
as a result of which control over the frequency 
at switch-over is even worse. Naturally, it is 
desirable to have as even a frequency curve as possible. Arrangements in which switching-over from one oscillator to 
the next is carried out, whereby control is performed in dependence 
upon the phase difference between adjacent oscillators 
are known from JP-A-56-84002 and JP-A-1-215124. According to the present invention as defined in the appended claims, the end of 
the frequency of each oscillator is used instead as 
switch-over criterion, which provides a continuous sweep 
without interruption. The arrangement according to the invention thus 
comprises a frequency detector coupled to each  
 
neighbouring pair of oscillators for detecting when the 
first oscillator in the pair has reached the same frequency 
as the second oscillator in the pair. The 
frequency detector then generates a switch-over signal for 
the respective sawtooth generators and control units so 
that the first oscillator is disconnected from the output 
and the second oscillator is connected to the output at 
the same time as the second oscillator frequency begins 
to be swept. The invention will now be described in detail 
with reference to the following drawing, in which the 
single figure is a block diagram of an embodiment of the 
invention. In the figure, an

Arrangement for generating a continuous frequency 
sweep comprising a number of voltage-controlled oscillators 

(VCO 1-4), each having its own frequency interval, 
which, together, can form a contiguous frequency interval, switches 

(S1-S4) for connecting a respective oscillator (VCO 1-4) 
to a common output (U), a respective sawtooth generator (G) linked 

to each oscillator (VCO 1-4) and a respective control unit linked to 
each switch (S1-S4), characterized in that a frequency 

detector (Φ) is connected to each pair of 
oscillators (VCO 1-4) having a neighbouring frequency intervall, for detecting when the first 

oscillator in the pair has reached the same frequency as 
the second oscillator in the pair and then generating 

a switch-over signal to respective sawtooth generators 
(G) and control units so that the first oscillator is 

disconnected from the output (U) and the second oscillator 
is connected to the output (U) at the same time as 

the frequency of the second oscillator begins to be 
swept. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that each frequency detector is also phase-sensitive, 

the switch-over signal being generated when the output 
signals from the first and second oscillator have the 

same frequency and phase.
