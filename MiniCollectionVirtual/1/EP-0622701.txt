<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus for forming an image on a recording
material, to which a process cartridge is detachably
mountable.The image forming apparatus includes a laser
beam printer, an LED printer, an electrophotographic
copying machine, a facsimile machine and a word
processor or the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a
printer, a uniformly charged image bearing member is
selectively exposed to light to form a latent image,
and the latent image is visualized with toner, and
thereafter, the toner image is transferred onto a
recording material.In such an apparatus, a toner has to be
supplied upon shortage thereof by an operator, which
is cumbersome and which may result in contamination.
Maintenance operations for various parts have to be
carried out by an expert service man with the result
of inconveniences imposed to the user.In view of this, the image bearing member,
the charger, the developing device and the cleaning
device or the like is unified into a cartridge. In
this case, by the user mounting the cartridge into the 
main assembly of the apparatus, the toner is supplied,
and the parts having reached the ends of the service
lives of various parts such as image bearing member,
are automatically exchanged, thus facilitating the
maintenance operation.GB-A-2 197 258 discloses an electrophotographic image forming apparatus as in the preamble of claim 1.Recently, a higher quality image is desired.
In an apparatus using such a process cartridge, the
positioning of an electrophotographic photosensitive
member relative to the main assembly or a correct
positioning of a feeding reference for a recording
material, are to be accurate to provide the high
quality images.Accordingly, it is a principal concern of the
present invention to provide an image forming
apparatus in which an image quality is improved.It is another concern of the present invention
to provide an image forming apparatus in which toner
image formation and toner image transfer can be
carried out with high positional accuracy.An image forming apparatus as defined in claim 1 solves these problems.These and other concerns, features and
advantages of the present invention will become more
apparent upon a consideration of the following
description of the preferred embodiments of the
present invention taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings.  Figure 1 is a sectional view of an embodiment
of the image forming apparatus according to the
present invention, depicting the general structure.Figure 2
