<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein A is C1 to C3 alkylene, Ar is phenyl or styryl, R is halosubstituted C1 to C3 alkyl, NHR' or (II), R' is hydrogen or C2 to C8 alkylthioalkyl, n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and p is an integer of from 2 to 5, with the proviso that when R' is hydrogen then Ar is styryl, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, inhibit the enzyme lipoxygenase and are useful in treating allergy and inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions for which the action of lipoxygenase has been implicated. These compounds form the active ingredient in pharmaceutical compositions for treating such conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel cyclopropyl N-hydroxyurea and N-hydroxyacetamide 
derivatives. The compounds of the present invention inhibit the action of 
the enzyme lipoxygenase and are useful in the treatment or alleviation of 
inflammatory diseases, allergy and cardiovascular diseases in mammals. This 
invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds 
and to the use of such compounds in treating inflammatory diseases, allergy and 
cardiovascular diseases in mammals. This invention further relates to methods of 
making such compounds. Arachidonic acid is known to be the biological precursor of several groups of 
endogenous metabolites, prostaglandins including prostacyclins, thromboxanes and 
leukotrienes. The first step of arachidonic acid metabolism is the release of 
arachidonic acid and related unsaturated fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, 
via the action of phospholipase. Free fatty acids are then metabolized either by 
cyclooxygenase to produce the prostaglandins and thromboxanes or by 
lipoxygenase to generate hydroperoxy fatty acids which may be further converted to 
the leukotrienes. Leukotrienes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, asthma, ischemia 
reperfusion injury, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Any drug that inhibits 
lipoxygenase is expected to provide significant new therapy for both acute and 
chronic inflammatory conditions. Several review articles on lipoxygenase inhibitors have been reported (See H. 
Masamune et al., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., 24, 71-80 (1989) and B.J. Fitzsimmons et 
al., Leukotrienes and Lipoxygenases, 427-502 (1989).  
 Compounds of the same general class as the compounds of the present 
invention are disclosed in EP 279263 A2, EP 196184 A2, EP 436199 A, JP (Kohyo) 
502179/88, JP (Appln.) 105048/90 and U.S. patent No. 4,822,809. The present invention provides novel cyclopropyl N-hydroxyurea and N-hydroxyacetamide 
derivatives of the following formula and their pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts.
