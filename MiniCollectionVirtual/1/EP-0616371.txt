<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor
devices and fabrication methods thereof. In particular,
the invention relates to semiconductor devices formed
on an SOI (Silicon on Insulator) substrate and
fabrication methods thereof. Also, the invention
relates to bipolar transistors having a control electrode
formed via an insulating film on a base region.In the development of advanced information
society nowadays, there has been a great contribution
of improved technology for semiconductor devices such
as transistors. Among such devices is included a
vertical bipolar transistor such as a planar bipolar
transistor. The vertical bipolar transistor operates
at high speed as a single element, and can act effectively
for the current amplification and switching.
However, when incorporated as an element into an
integrated circuit, the vertical bipolar transistor
is difficult to combine with condenser or other
transistor from the problem of the process times. One
method of constituting an integrated circuit by the
combination of a bipolar transistor with other element
is to arrange laterally the bipolar transistor to 
enhance coordination with the process times. There
is a Bi-CMOS structure in which a MOS transistor is
chosen as other element to combine with the bipolar
transistor. Bi-CMOS allows for the design of logics
with high speed and low consumption power, because
the bipolar transistor operating at high speed and
the MOS transistor operating at low consumption power
can be incorporated into one IC.The process of incorporating the bipolar
transistor as one element in IC of Bi-CMOS fabricated
on silicon wafer is referred to as a silicon wafer
bulk process. Conventionally, the vertical bipolar
transistor and the lateral bipolar transistor has been
formed through the silicon wafer bulk process, as shown
in Figs. 67 and 68.In Fig. 67, an NPN-type vertical bipolar
transistor 301 is electrically separated from other
elements by an element separation region 302. Herein,
303 is a P-type silicon substrate, 304 is an N+-type
region which is a collector region for the vertical
bipolar transistor 301, 305 is an N--type epitaxial
region, 306 is a collector lead-out layer, 307 is a
P-type region for element separation, 308 is a selective
oxidation region, 309 is a P-type base region,
310 is an N+-type emitter region, 311 is an interlayer
insulating layer, 312, 313, and 314 are Al electrodes,
and 315 is a passivation insulating layer. In Fig. 68, a PNP-type lateral bipolar
transistor is shown. The PNP-type lateral
