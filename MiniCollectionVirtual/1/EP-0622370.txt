<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel chemical compounds 
having pesticidal activity, to methods for their 
preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use 
in the control of pests. More particularly the invention 
relates to a class of heterobicycloalkanes. The use of certain pesticidally active 2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes 
is disclosed in European Patent Applications 
Nos. 152229, 211598, 216625, 216624, US Patent 3686224 
and J.Agric.Food Chem. 33, 976 (1985). It has now been discovered 
that derivatives of these compounds have interesting 
pesticidal activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound 
of the formula (I): 
   wherein R is a C₂₋₁₀ non-aromatic hydrocarbyl group 
optionally substituted by, or methyl substituted by cyano, 
halo, C₁₋₄ alkoxy optionally substituted by halo, or a group 
S(O)mR³ where R³ is C₁₋₄ alkyl optionally substituted by halo 
and m is 0, 1 or 2, or R is phenyl optionally substituted by 
C₁₋₄ alkoxy, C₁₋₃ alkyl, C₂₋₄ alkynyl, halo, C₁₋₄ haloalkyl, 
cyano or a group S(O)mR³ as defined hereinbefore;
 
   R¹ and R² may be the same or different, and each is 
hydrogen, halo, or a C₁₋₃ aliphatic group optionally substituted 
by halo, cyano, C₁₋₅ carbalkoxy, C₁₋₄ alkoxy, or a 
group S(O)m' R⁴ wherein m' is O, 1 or 2 and R⁴ is C₁₋₄ alkyl; 
cyano, gem- dimethyl, or C₁₋₅ carbalkoxy, or R¹ and R and the 
carbon atoms to which they are attached form a C₅₋₇ carbocyclic 
ring optionally substituted by halo, or a C₁₋₃ aliphatic  
 
or alkoxy group;
 
   A is a C₅₋₈ non-aromatic hydrocarbyl group which contains 
one hetero atom selected from oxygen or sulphur and 
terminates in a C≡C fragment adjacent to X.
 
   X is hydrogen. Y and Y¹ are the same or different and are each selected 
from oxygen and S(O)n' where n'is 0, 1 or 2; and Z is CH₂O or 
CH₂S(O)n'', wherein n''is 0, 1 or 2; In the definition of Z, 
the first mentioned atom is adjacent to the 4-position of the 
bicyclic ring system. When R is an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, cycloalkyl or 
cycloalkenyl group this preferably contains up to 6 carbon 
atoms. Conveniently, when R is substituted there are up to 7 
substituents when the substituent is fluoro, 3 substituents 
when the substituents are chloro or bromo or 1 substituent 
when this is other than halo. Suitably, R is an aliphatic or alicyclic group containing 
between 2 and 8 carbon atoms or phenyl each optionally 
substituted by cyano, 1 to 7 halo atoms, C₁₋₄ alkoxy or a 
group S(O)mR⁴ as hereinbefore defined. Most suitably R is 
propyl,
