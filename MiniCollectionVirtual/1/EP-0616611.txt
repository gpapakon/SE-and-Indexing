A process for the production of lower alkyl oligoglucosides, 
characterized in that 


a) aqueous glucose sirup is added to a mixture of a lower 
alcohol and an acidic catalyst at elevated temperatures 


via
 an inline mixer, 
b) the water present in the reaction mixture and the 
water released are azeotropically distilled off 

continuously and 
c) after the addition of glucose sirup, the reaction 
mixture is subjected to an after-reaction. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
glucose sirup having a solids content of 50 to 85% by 

weight, based on the sirup is used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 glucose sirup having a DP 1 content of 90 to 100% 
by weight, based on the solids content, is used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 inline mixers having a shear rate of 
10
4
 to 10
6
 s
-1
 are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 inline mixers having an average shear 
pulse count per unit volume of 10
5
 to 10
8
 l
-1
 are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 lower alcohols corresponding to 
formula (I) 


R
1
-OH
   
(I)
 
in which R
1
 is a linear or branched alkyl radical containing 
3 to 8 carbon atoms are used.  

 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterized in that
 acidic catalysts selected from the 
group consisting of p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic 

acid, butanesulfonic acid and sulfosuccinic acid are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized in that
 glucose and lower alcohol are used in 
a molar ratio of 1:3 to 1:10. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 8, 

characterized in that
 the acidic catalyst is used in 
quantities of 3 · 10
-3
 to 2 · 10
-2
 mol per mol glucose. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 9, 

characterized in that
 the glucose sirup is added over a 
period of 0.1 to 3 h at such a rate that a fine-particle 

dispersion is formed. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
10, 
characterized in that
 the after-reaction is carried out 
over a period of 0.1 to 2 h. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
11, 
characterized in that
 the acetalization and the after-reaction 
are carried out at temperatures of 100 to 115°C.
