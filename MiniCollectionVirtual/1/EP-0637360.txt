A honeycomb body (10; 20) of electrically conductive material 
which is so electrically subdivided by slots (13, 14; 23, 24) and/or 

electrically insulating layers that an electrical current can flow 
through the body (10; 20) on a tortuous path (17; 27) characterised in 

that the honeycomb body (10; 20) comprises regions (18, 48; 28, 58) of 
different materials (M1, M2) of different resistivities. 
A honeycomb body according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
honeycomb body (10; 20) is an extruded body of metal powder or a 

mixture of metal and ceramic powder. 
A honeycomb body according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that the honeycomb body (10; 20) is a carrier body for catalytically 

active material, in particular for an electrically heatable catalytic 
converter of a motor vehicle. 
A honeycomb body according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3 
characterised in that the honeycomb body (10; 20) is so subdivided by a 

plurality of approximately parallel but mutually displaced slots (13, 
14; 23, 24) that an electrical current (17; 27) can flow approximately 

in a meander configuration through the body. 
A honeycomb body according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
slots (13, 14; 23, 24) have ends (19; 29) in the interior of the 

honeycomb body (10; 20) and the honeycomb body (10; 20), at least in 
the region (18; 28) of the ends (19; 29) of the slots (13, 14; 23, 24), 

comprises a material (M1) with a higher resistivity than in the other 
regions (48; 58).  

 
A honeycomb body according to claim 4 or claim 5 characterised 
in that the honeycomb body is a cylindrical (20) or oval-cylindrical 

(10) body with approximately axially extending slots (13, 14; 23, 24) 
which are respectively disposed in displaced relationship approximately 

parallel to a radius and extend from the outside to an end (19; 29) in 
the interior of the honeycomb body (10; 20) and that in its inner 

cross-sectional region (18; 28) which embraces at least all ends (19; 
29) of the slots (13, 14; 23, 24), the honeycomb body (10; 20) 

comprises a material (M2) of higher resistivity than in its outer cross-sectional 
region (48; 58). 
A honeycomb body according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the honeycomb body (10; 20) has an overall 

electrical resistance of 0.01 to 1 ohm. 
A honeycomb body according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the region (18; 28) with the higher resistivity 

has a resistivity which is at least about double the region (48; 58) 
with the lower resistivity. 
A process for the production of a honeycomb body with regions 
(18; 48; 28, 58) of different resistivities, according to one of the 

preceding claims, characterised by the following steps: 

a) an extruder (30) is fed with two different masses (M1, M2) of 
metal powder or metal-ceramic powder mixture, are specifically one in 

the inner region (32) and one in an outer region (31) surrounding the 
inner region (32); 
b) the different masses (M1, M2) are jointly extruded to give a 
monolithic honeycomb-body (10; 20); 
c) the extruded honeycomb body (10; 20) is calcined or sintered or 
possibly differently according to the regions involved, subjected to 

physical-chemical treatment; and 
d) the extruded honeycomb body (10; 20) is provided with displaced 
slots (13, 14; 23, 24).
