<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the removal of metals from starting materials comprising proteinaceous substances by labilizing and solubilizing the metal with a treatment with chemical agent which includes leaching out, extraction, removal by means of redox and/or acid-base reactions, wherein this chemical treatment is combined with a treatment causing cross-linking of the proteins in the proteinaceous material. The invention allows for the treatment of e.g. leather wastes for the removal of chromium therein. After the appropriate treatment collagen is obtained. This collagen is structurally undamaged, free of chromium and suitable for uses in cosmetics, drugs, high quality gelatin, food, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for the removal of metals from starting materials comprising proteinaceous substances as well as material obtainable according to such a method.The invention relates to a method for the removal of metals from starting materials comprising proteinaceous substances by treatment with chemical agents including leaching out, extraction, removal by means of redox and/or acid-base reactions.Methods of this type are generally known. In particular these methods are used for the removal of chromium from leather, e.g. leather wastes in the wet-blue stage, which have undergone tanning with chromium salts only or with chromium salts in combination with other substances such as aluminum salts and complexing agents.One of the known methods involves the use of enzymes to remove chromium from leather. This method yields hydrolyzed collagen.Known methods involve the use of specific chemical substances such as sodium glycolate, or the use of acid and/or base. However, these methods require a treatment during a long period and/or yield a hydrolyzed collagen product, e.g. gelatin.Chem. Abstr. Vol. 102, No. 104, January 1985, page 126, abstract No. 26833y (JP-A-59179600) mentions the removal of chromium from chrome containing leather shavings by emersing succesively in milk of lyme sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and sulfuric acid. Although this method provides a complete removal of chromium, the proteinaceous material (leather shavings) is destroyed in the sense that it is highly hydrolyzed.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the removal of metals from starting materials comprising proteinaceous substances by treatment with chemical agents including leaching out, extraction, removal by means of redox and/or acid-base reactions, which method yields a proteinaceous material such as collagen which is not hydrolyzed, not denaturated, in general un¬ damaged. Another object is to obtain a product containing as less metal - such as chromium - as possible. 

 These objects are achieved by the present invention, which provides a method of the type as mentioned in the preamble, wherein the treatment is a combination of processes causing cross-linking of the proteins in the proteinaceous material, and labilization-solubi- lization of the metal.Consequently, the present invention relates to a method for the removal of metals from starting materials comprising proteinaceous substances by labilizing and solubilizing the metal with a treatment with chemical agent which includes

1. A method for the removal of metals from starting materials comprising proteinaceous substances by labilizing and solubilizing the metal with a treatment with chemical agent which includes leaching out, extraction, removal by means of redox and/or acid-base reactions, wherein this chemical treatment is combined with a treat¬ ment causing cross-linking of the proteins in the proteinaceous material.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the treatment having 
"
 the combined effect of cross-linking, labilization, and solubili¬ zation comprises a treatment with free radical producing means including ionizing radiation, UV, ultrasonic treatment, heat treatment, and/or treatment with chemical cross-linkers.
3- The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the treatment causing cross-linking starts with soaking in acid.
4. The method according to any of claims 1-3 for the removal of chromium from a starting material such as leather comprising the steps of a) subjecting the starting material to the treatment causing cross-linking and partial labilization and solubilization in an acid medium, b) separating off the acid medium from the material produced at step a) , c) subjecting the material produced at step b) to a treatment with a strong base in order to labilize and solubilize Cr

 leaving the cross-linked protein undamaged, d) separating off the basic medium from the material produced at step c) , and optionally, e) subjecting the material produced at step d) to a treatment with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a
— reducing agent to obtain collageneous material. . 


5. The method according to claim 4, wherein in step e) the oxi¬ dizing agent is used at a pH-value between 6 and 8.
6. The method according to claim 4, complemented by treating the collageneous material obtained with water at a temperature of
50-80°C to obtain sterilized and, high Bloom number gelatin or at higher temperature up to 100°C to obtain sterilized, lower Bloom number and technical gelatin.
7- Material obtainable according to any of the preceding claims.
