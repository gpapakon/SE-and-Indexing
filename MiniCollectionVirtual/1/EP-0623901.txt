<CLAIMS>
A device for securing sensor elements in the housing of 
an electronic or an accepting apparatus, wherein on the 

outer side of a plate (12, 14) constraining the coin 
track a retainer (46) of plastic material is provided, 

characterized in that at least one spring arm (42, 44; 
58 to 64) is formed at the retainer which presses a 

sensor element (26, 26a; 54, 56) against plate (12, 
14), and means are provided at the plate which constrain 

the sensor element laterally. 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the spring 
arm (58 to 64) has a radial enlargement (66), and the 

enlargement (66) is provided with a hole (68) for the 
through-passage of connecting wires. 
The device of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that at 
the side of the plate (12, 14) of plastic material 

opposite to the coin track (16) an axially slotted stud 
(32) is formed for the accommodation of an annular 

shell-type ferrite core (28) for an inductive sensor 
element (24, 26), the coil (30) of the core being inserted 

into a recess (20, 22) of plate (12, 14). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the cross-slotted 
stud (32) is circular in cross section and has 

a radial projection (34) at the outer circumference. 
The device of one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the retainer (46) is shaped like a frame, and 

one or a plurality of spring arms (42, 44; 58 to 64) 
are located on the inner side of frame (48).  

 
The device of claim 5, characterized in that extensions 
(50) are formed at the outer side of frame (48) for the 

attachment of the corresponding plate (12, 14). 
The device of claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the 
frame (48) defines a trough or the like for the accommodation 

of a casting mass.
