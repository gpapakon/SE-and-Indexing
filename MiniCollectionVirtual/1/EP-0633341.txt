<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus and 
process for precisely measuring the position of a deflector 

blade. When patterned dyeing a moving textile web wherein 
continuously flowing streams of liquid normally directed in paths 

to impinge upon the web are selectively deflected from contact 
with the web in accordance with pattern information then each 

continuously flowing liquid stream is selectively deflected by a 
stream of air which is discharged, in accordance with pattern 

information, from an air outlet located adjacent each liquid 
discharge outlet. The air outlet is positioned to direct the air 

stream into intersecting relation with the liquid stream and to 
deflect the liquid into a collection chamber or trough for 

recirculation. To accurately control the amount of dye applied 
to a given location on the material during the dyeing operation, 

and to insure that the dye strikes the material in a very small, 
precise spot, the lower portion of the collection chamber 

contains a deflector blade (84) supportably positioned in spaced 
relation above the lower wall of the collection chamber and 

wherein means (301) are provided for accurately measuring the position 
of the deflector blade to facilitate accurate placement of the 

dye streams on the moving material during the printing process 
and precise interception of the streams when deflected.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is known to apply liquids such as dyes to moving textile 
materials from plural streams which are directed onto the 
materials and selectively controlled to produce a desired pattern 
thereon. McElveen U.S. Patent No. 3,393,411 describes apparatus 
and process wherein plural streams of liquid are selectively 
controlled in their flow to provide a distinct pattern on pile 
carpet. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,443,878 and 3,570,275 describe apparatus 
and process for the patterned dyeing of a moving textile web 
wherein continuously flowing streams of liquid normally directed 
in paths to impinge upon the web are selectively deflected from 
contact with the web in accordance with pattern information. The 
webs are thus dyed in a desired pattern and the deflected dye is 
collected and recirculated for use. Each continuously flowing 
liquid stream is selectively deflected by a stream of air which 
is discharged, in accordance with pattern information, from an 
air outlet located adjacent each liquid discharge outlet. The 
air outlet is positioned to direct the air stream into 
intersecting relation with the liquid stream and to deflect the 
liquid into a collection chamber or trough for recirculation. To 
control accurately the amount of dye applied to a given location  
 
on the material during the dyeing operation, and to insure that 
the dye strikes the material in a very small, precise spot, the 
lower portion of the collection chamber contains a deflector 
blade supportably positioned in spaced relation above the lower 
wall of the collection chamber. This deflector blade is 
adjustably attached to the lower wall so that its edge can be 
accurately positioned relative the dye discharge axes of a gun 
bar to insure prompt and precise interception of the streams when 
deflected. A gunbar is defined as a plurality of dye jets, 
arranged in spaced alignment, which extend generally above and 
across the width of a substrate to be treated. Details of such a 
dyeing apparatus and collection chamber are described and claimed 
in commonly assigned Mccollough, Jr. et al., U.S. Patent No. 
4,019,352 issued April 26, 1977 and hereby incorporated by 
reference. It can be appreciated that in the application of different 
colored dyes to the surface of textile fabrics, it is extremely 
important to place each dyestuff on the fabric accurately, 
particularly when intricate patterns are being printed and when 
in situ blending is employed. Precise measurement of the 
position of the deflector blade with respect to the dye
