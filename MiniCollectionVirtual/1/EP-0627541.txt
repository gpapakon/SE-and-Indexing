<ABSTRACT>
Connecting element for connecting parallel section members which retain parts of a door-panelling arrangement which are located in one plane, the door-panelling arrangement being constructed in the manner of a sandwich-time structural element, with two panels which are connected by a soft insulating layer. The connecting element (7) has a fixing member (10) which can be introduced into the insulating layer (4) of the panelling arrangement constructed in the manner of a sandwich-type structural element (3).

Connecting element for parallel section members (5, 11), holding the elements of a 
door-panel being located on one level, whereas the door-panel is made sandwich-like 

of two plates (3), connected with a soft insulating layer (4),
characterized in that
 
the connecting element (7) has a fixing member (10), which can be inserted into the 

insulating layer (4) of the sandwich-like built door-panel. 
Connecting element according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the fixing member is designed like a tongue (10). 
Connecting element according to claim 2,
characterized in that
 
the connecting element (7) consists of two connecting parts (8, 9), whereas one of 

the connecting parts (9) has a housing (12) for receiving the other connecting part 
(8), whereas the tongue (10) is arranged onto the housing (12). 
Connecting element according to claim 2,
characterized in that
 
the tongue (10) has its side designed as an edge. 
Connecting element according to claim 2,
characterized in that
 
the tongue (10) is adjacent on one side to the inner side of one of the outer plates (3) 

and that thus the section member (5, 11) is clamped onto the 
outer plate (3). 
Connecting element according to claim 3,
characterized in that
 
the section members (5, 11) have a T-shaped groove (5a, 11a). 
Connecting element according to claim 6,
characterized in that
 
the connecting part (8, 9) has a T-head locking element (14, 23) for the T-shaped 

groove (5, 11a) of the section members (5, 11). 
Connecting element according to claim 2,
characterized in that
 
a polygonal bipartite box (15, 16) is inserted in the housing (12) 

of the connecting part (9), whose inner shape is cylindrical, whereas the other 
connecting part (8) has a plug (19) that fits closely into the inner part. 
Connecting element according to claim 8,
characterized in that
 
the inner form has inner snap grooves (18) and the plug (19) outer snap grooves (20) 

constituting thus a longitudinally adjustable locking frame.  
 
Connecting element according to claim 8,
characterized in that
 
the close-fitting connection between plug (19) and inner shape of the housing (12) is 

achieved by means of a thread-connection. 
Connecting element according to claim 8
characterized in that
 
the other connecting part (8) has a polygonal plate (21), which enables the torsion of 

this connecting part (8).
