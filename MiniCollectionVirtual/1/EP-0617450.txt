<ABSTRACT>
A streak tube the total length of which is short. An 
optical image of an object is converted into a plurality 

of divided micro incident electronic images by converting 
means (110) and photoelectrons from these divided micro 

incident electronic images are focused by a focusing 
electron lens (111). Further, the photoelectrons are swept by 

a deflecting means (112) and imaged on an output plane. Thus, 
the optical image of the object is converted into the 

divided micro incident electronic images, so that 
focusing and sweeping can be performed in short distance. 

Accordingly, the total length of the tube can be short.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a streak tube.
More specifically the invention relates to a streak tube
which can measure time-variation of an object or an
image of which the shape or the lightness is varied at
high speed.A conventional streak tube which can obtain
information of the time concerning the two-dimensional
image is disclosed in the reference "Rev. Sci Instrum 52
(8).Aug. 1981 p.1190-1192". Referring to Fig. 24, a
configuration of the conventional streak tube will be
explained. As shown in Fig. 24, the conventional streak
tube comprises an optical mask 102 and an optical lens
103 in front of a photocathode 101, and a mesh
accelerating electrode 104, a focusing lens 105,
deflecting electrodes 106 and 107, and an output
phosphorous screen 108 in the rear of the photocathode
101. A two-dimensional optical image of an object to be
measured which has entered the streak tube is divided
into micro-images through the optical mask 102, and the
divided micro-images are formed on the photocathode 101.
Then, photoelectron beams emitted from the photocathode
101 are swept by the deflecting electrodes 106 and 107,
and a streaking image of each divided micro-image
(pixel) is formed on the 
output phosphor screen 108.In this case, since the entered optical image of the
object is 5-10 mm in size, in order to form the streaking
image corresponding to the optical image of the object on
the output phosphorous screen, regarding a spherical
aberration and so forth, a focusing electron lens having
a diameter a few times larger than the size of the optical
image of the object is needed. And the length of the
focusing electrode system in a direction of the tube-axis
corresponding to the focusing electron lens is five to
six times larger than a diameter of the focusing electron
lens. Therefore, the total length of the streak tube
becomes long to 200 mm-300 mm. Further, because the total
length of the streak tube is long, running time of the
photoelectron therethrough is large, and the blur of the
optical image of the object having the high lightness
becomes large due to a space-charge effect. Further,
photoelectric currents emitted in accordance with the
total optical image are crossed in the vicinity of an
anode aperture 109, and the photoelectric current density
becomes large, so that the blur of the image becomes large
also due to the space-charge effect.Further, the photoelectrons emitted from the
different positions on the photocathode 101 pass through
the different positions on the focusing lens 105, so that
