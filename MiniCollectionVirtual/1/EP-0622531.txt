<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust pipe assembly (10) is provided for 
achieving a quick light-off of a catalytic 

converter (20). Exhaust pipe assembly (10) comprises 
circuitously bent inner (30) and outer pipes (32) disposed in 

generally concentric relationship to one another. 
The inner pipe (30) is formed from a very thin metal to 

provide a low thermal mass and a correspondingly low 
heat dissipation therefrom. The outer pipe (32) is 

thicker to provide structural support, and defines 
an air insulation barrier around the inner pipe (30) to 

further reduce heat dissipation. The inner pipe (30) is 
corrugated at selected locations (34,36) that will 

correspond to bends (23,24) in the circuitous exhaust pipe 
assembly (10). The thin-walled locally corrugated inner 

pipe (30) is then inserted into the outer pipe (32), and the 
assembly (10) is bent into the required configuration. 

The corrugations (34,36) support the inner (30) and outer (32) pipe 
relative to one another during the bending process 

and during use. The bent pipe assembly (10) then is 
connected to the catalytic converter (20) for subsequent 

mounting to vehicle engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
Catalytic converters are used in vehicular 
exhaust systems to convert certain objectionable 
gases into environmentally more acceptable forms. 
The catalyst in the converter becomes operative or 
"lights-off" after it is heated to a specified 
temperature by the exhaust gases. Prior to 
lighting-off, the catalytic converter falls 
considerably short of complying with the air quality 
standards in most jurisdictions. The walls of the exhaust pipe leading from 
the engine to the catalytic converter are cold when 
the vehicle is first started. These cold pipes 
function as heat sinks which effectively draw heat 
from the exhaust gases traveling therethrough, and 
hence retard the lighting-off of the catalytic 
converter. The amount of heat dissipated in the 
walls of the pipe between the engine and the 
catalytic converter is a function of the thermal 
mass of the pipe, which in turn is a function of the 
pipe length, pipe diameter, surface area and pipe 
thickness. Catalytic converters typically are 
disposed as close as possible to the upstream end of 
an exhaust system where the exhaust gas is hottest. 
The upstream location is intended to accelerate the 
heating of the catalyst, and thereby achieves a 
quicker light-off. However, the engine compartment 
of a vehicle generally is too crowded to accommodate  
 
a catalytic converter and the required heat shields. 
Hence, the converter normally is disposed downstream 
of the engine compartment. Crowding in the engine 
compartment also requires a circuitous routing of 
the exhaust pipe extending from the engine manifold, 
through the engine compartment and to the catalytic 
converter. The circuitous routing of the exhaust 
pipe leading to the catalytic converter adds to the 
total length of the exhaust pipe. Thus, there is 
often a relatively long run of exhaust pipe between 
the manifold and the catalytic converter, even in 
instances where the catalytic converter can be 
placed fairly close to the engine compartment. Thin pipes draw less heat from exhaust gas 
than thicker pipes in view of the lower thermal mass 
of the thinner pipes. However, pipes in the engine 
compartment are subject to almost continuous 
vibration and frequent shock. Thin pipes are likely 
to behave poorly in response to vibration and shock. 
Additionally, normal engine maintenance requires 
workers to periodically access the engine 
compartment with tools. Forcible contact with a 
large tool can deform or otherwise damage a thin-walled 
pipe in the engine compartment. A
