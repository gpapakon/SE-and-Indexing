<ABSTRACT>
Thermal regulation process and apparatus for heater means for positive temperature coefficient resistors. The invention relates to a thermal regulation process for a heating apparatus including heater means, a temperature probe, an electric motor driving a fan, in which the ambient temperature is continuously measured, the signal obtained is transformed into an electrical voltage, the ambient temperature is continuously compared with a set temperature, the temperature difference is transformed into an electrial voltage, the speed of rotation of the fan is controlled through a supply voltage (U) to the electric motor, characterised in that it consists in chopping the supply voltage (U) to the electric motor. Application to heating appliances.
