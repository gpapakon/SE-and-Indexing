The thrombosis filter (I, II) of this invention includes a first and a second filtering and holding unit, each unit including a coupling mechanism (41, 42) at its outer extremity in the form of a hook, and a plurality of resilient struts (31, 32) which radiate from a central hub (51, 52) and lie on the surfaces of cones. The units are interconnected by a core shaft (1) which consists of a compression spring and a pair of core wires.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thrombosis filters.
To be more specific, it is about removable thrombosis filters
which can be securely fixed at a selected location in the
vascular system for trapping blood clots, and removed when
desired such as when no longer required.In recent years, pulmonary embolism has become an
increasingly common medical emergency. Pulmonary embolisms
may be caused by venous thrombosis that in turn may be caused
by blood flow retention, venous intimal damage or coagulation
abnormalities. Emergency or prophylactic treatments for these
conditions include anticoagulant therapy, thrombolytic
therapy, thrombectomy and inferior vena cava blocking
procedures.Among these therapeutic options, when an inferior
vena cava blocking procedure is selected, one option is to
perform a laparotomy under general anesthesia during which the
inferior vena cava is ligated, sutured and shortened, or
clipped. Another option is to intravenously insert a
thrombosis filter into the inferior vena cava under local
anesthesia. A laparotomy however, retires general anesthesia
and is susceptible to thrombosis formation due to the
discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy prior to surgery.
For these reasons, percutaneous filter insertion is now more
widely employed since it retires only local anesthesia.Blood is returned to the heart from the lower part
of the human body through the inferior vena cava and from the
upper part of the body through the superior vena cava. The
neck vein, known as the jugular vein, leads to the superior
vena cava which is a vein that enters the upper part of the
heart. A percutaneously inserted catheter that extends
through the jugular vein and the superior vena cava and then
into the heart can be manipulated to exit the heart through
the mouth of the inferior vena cava into the heart. The
inferior vena cava, a vein that enters the lower part of the 
heart, can also be accessed through the patients femoral vein.
Thus, the inferior vena cava can be reached through two
endovenous routes, both of which are available percutaneously.A currently used percutaneous filter is shown in
Figure 9. The filter has anchors, 43, at the end of six
struts, (31), with a head or central hub or fixation part, 5.
One example of how this filter is used is to lead the filter
within a capsule with the head of the filter introduced first
if using the transfemoral vein approach or with the tail of
it introduced first if using the transjugular vein approach.
This type of filter possesses hooks at the end of the

A thrombosis filter adapted to be percutaneously

implanted, in and removed from a blood vessel having
an inner wall, through an endovenous route via a tube,

said thrombosis filter comprising:

a filtering and holding device that extends along
a longitudinal axis and is flexible in its radial

dimension,
said filtering and holding device being
dimensioned such that it can be compressed radially

into a collapsed condition in which it can be received
in said tube and will open out and expand into biased

engagement with the inner wall of said blood vessel
when it emerges from the tube,

characterised in that said filtering and holding
device includes coupling mechanisms (41, 42) at both

ends, said coupling mechanisms accessible through
endovenous routes to enable the filtering and holding

device to be seized at both ends of the device,
released from the inner wall of said blood vessel and

withdrawn percutaneously from the blood vessel.
A thrombosis filter as claimed in claim 1 further
characterised in that said thrombosis filter includes

first and second portions (I, II) displaced
longitudinally and joined by a resilient member (1)

that enables said first and second portions to move
longitudinally relative to each other to facilitate

releasing the first and second portions from the inner
wall during removal.
A thrombosis filter as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2 further characterised in that said thrombosis

filter includes a recovery device (63, 64) that can be 
inserted percutaneously and threaded through an

endovenous route such that its distal end is located
at said filtering and holding device, and


coupling mechanism (71, 72) carried by said
recovery device at its distal end, said coupling

mechanism carried by said recovery device being
complementary to said coupling mechanism (41, 42) of

said filtering and holding device such that said
filtering and holding device can be seized by said

recovery device.
A thrombosis filter as claimed in claims 1 or 2
further characterised in that said coupling mechanisms

(41, 42, 71, 72) on the filtering and holding device are
made of radiopaque material to assist in the process

of snaring the filtering and holding device.
A thrombosis filter as claimed in claim 3 further
characterised in that said thrombosis filter includes

a recovery tube (61, 62) having an open distal end
dimensioned to receive the collapsed filtering and

holding device,

said recovery tube adapted to be inserted
percutaneously into the patient and threaded over an

endovenous route such that its open distal end is
adjacent the filtering and holding device, said

recovery device functioning to move the filtering and
holding device from its location within the blood

vessel to a location within the distal end of said
recovery tube.
A thrombosis filter as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims to be placed in the blood vessel of a

patient for trapping clots, the filter being adapted
to be inserted percutaneously through an insertion 

tube or tubes and expelled from the insertion tube or
tubes at a selected location in the blood stream,

where it implants itself in the inner wall of the
blood vessel so as to prevent migration of the filter

within the blood vessel,

said filter includes a first and second unit (I,
II) that are spaced from each other along the filter's

longitudinal axis,

characterised in that each of said units includes
a plurality of spurs (31, 32) anchored such that their

free ends radiate outwardly at an acute angle to said
longitudinal axis in the direction toward the other of

said units, said plurality of spurs open out from a
collapsed condition when the filter is released from

the insertion tube or tubes into the blood vessel at
the desired position causing the free ends to engage

the inner wall of said blood vessel,
one or more of said spurs functioning to filter
out clots that are flowing through the blood vessel,
one or more of said spurs having free ends that
are forced into the side wall of the blood vessel as a

result of a force attempting to move the filter
axially of the blood vessel, one or more of said free

ends functions as a holding device to anchor the
filter at the desired position within the blood

vessel,
said insertion tube or tubes including a pusher
that is maneuverable from the proximal end of the

insertion tube or tubes for expelling the filter out
the distal end of the insertion tube or tubes.
A thrombosis filter as claimed in claim 6 wherein

said first and second units (I, II) are
interconnected by a resilient member (1) extending

along said longitudinal axis characterised in that 
said resilient member exerts a force on said units

causing the free ends of the spurs 31, 32 to grip the
inner wall of the blood vessel and hold the filter in

its desired position.
A thrombosis filter as described in claim 7
further characterised in that each unit I, II of said

filter includes a core wire (21, 22), one end of each
core wire is anchored to one of said units and extends

from its anchor along said resilient member toward the
other unit, said core wires terminating in free ends

short of said other unit.

(a) providing a tube having open ends;
(b) inserting an end of a coupling mechanism into one
of the open ends of said tube;
(c) inserting the ends of a plurality of outwardly
diverging spurs into the other open end of said tube;

open end of said tube;
(e) filling all remaining space in the tube between
its open ends with a bonding material that will harden

to secure the coupling mechanism, plurality of spurs
and core wire in the tube.

additional steps of:


(f) providing a second tube having open ends;
(g) inserting an end of a coupling mechanism in one
