<ABSTRACT>
A removable core (1) for a pre-streched elastomeric tube includes a serpentine rather than helical arrangement for break lines (22) around the core (1) which permits the core (1) to be withdrawn in one continuous pulling operation rather than the intermittent,rotating operation required in the past.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pre-stretched 
elastomeric tubing (hereinafter PST) mounted on 
a plastic core which can be removed to allow the PST to 
contract into contact with an object to be covered by the 
tube. One method of insulating and environmentally 
protecting a connector for a power cable or other cable 
is by use of a contractible insulating tube expanded to 
fit over the outer surface of a hollow cylindrical core. 
The tube and core are slid over one cable end and the 
cables connected by means of the connector. The tube and 
core are then repositioned over the connector area and 
the hollow cylindrical core is pulled out so that the 
expanded insulating tube may contract into contact with 
the connector and cables. US-A-3,515,798 
describes a one-piece, rigid, plastic 
core having interconnected adjacent coils in a closed 
helix configuration. One end of the core is partially 
unwound and led back through the core so that pulling on 
this end will cause the core to unwind and allow the tube 
to contract. Because the core is helically wound, the 
core length as it is extracted through the space between 
the core and the object over which the core has been 
positioned must be rotated around the object as the core 
end is pulled. This is cumbersome and does not permit 
the use of automation to remove the core as the machine 
cannot release the core on one side of the object and 
regrasp it on the other side of the object.  
 Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 3-28387 
describes a straight pull-out core which overcomes the 
aforesaid drawback. This core comprises a cylinder having 
a series of substantially parallel lines of localized 
weakening. Successive lines define a strip beginning at 
a free end and continuing in a serpentine length between 
and around consecutive lines so that pulling said free 
end will cause said strip to separate along said lines 
and permit said core to be removed from said tube without 
coiling of said strip. The core 
ribbon to be broken when pulled out 
straight is secured with multiple thin ribs. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
removable core for supporting a pre-stretched elastomeric 
tube in a radially-expanded condition that is difficult 
to crush and which may be removed without the necessity 
of rotating the core end around the object over which the 
core and the tube were positioned. In an effort to achieve the above object, the present 
invention provides a removable core for supporting a pre-stretched 
elastomer

<CLAIMS>
Removable core for supporting a pre-stretched 
elastomeric tube in a radially-expanded condition 

comprising: 

a flexible sheet (11) having opposite edges 
(13,14) which include means for interlocking 

said opposite edges (13,14) to maintain said 
sheet (11) in a cylinder, 
said sheet having a series of substantially 
parallel lines (22) of localized weakening 

extending from one of said opposite edges (13; 
14) to a point near but short of the other of 

said opposite edges (14;13), with successive 
lines (22) extending from alternate edges (13, 

14) of said sheet (11) to define a strip beginning 
at a free end (23) and continuing in a serpentine 

length between and around consecutive 
lines (22), 
so that pulling said free end (23) will cause 
said strip to separate along said lines and permit 

said core to be removed from said tube without 
coiling of said strip. 
Removable core according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said means for interlocking said opposite 

edges (13,14) comprises a plurality of projections 
(15,16) extending from said edges (13,14) of said 

sheet (11) at substantially equal intervals and 
said projections (15;16) of one of said edges (13; 

14) fit between said projections (16;15) of the 
other of said edges (14;13) to interlock said edges 

(13,14) and said cylinder and said lines (22) 
extend from a point in said projection (15;16) of 

one of said edges (13;14) to a point between two of  
 

said projections (16;15) on the other of said edges 
(14;13). 
Removable core according to claim 2 characterized 
in that each of the projections (15,16) has a 

generally circular shape. 
Removable core according to claim 2 or 3 characterized 
in that each of said projections (15,16) 

has a root (17) and a bulbous portion (18) positioned 
distal from said root (17) of the projection 

(15,16), said bulbous portion (18) having a width 
wider than the distance (19) between said bulbous 

portion (18) of one of said projections (15,16) and 
said bulbous portion (18) of an adjacent projection 

(15,16), with the width of said root (17) of said 
projection (15,16) being the same as, or narrower 

than, the distance (19) between the root (17) of 
one of said projections (15,16) and said root (17) 

of an adjacent projection (15,16). 
Removable core according to any one of claims 2 to 
4 characterized in that each of said projections 

(15,16) has an opening (24) positioned generally 
centrally of the projection (15,16) with said 

opening (24) contacting said line (22) of 
weakening. 
Removable core according to any one of claims 2 to 
5 characterized in that each of the projections 

(15,16) has at its tip portion a thickened portion 
(25) for reinforcement. 
Removable core according to claim 1 characterized 
in that said means for interlocking said opposite  

 
edges (13,14) comprises complimentarily engaging 

fittings. 
Removable core according to claim 7 characterized 
in that said fittings comprise a projection (35) 

extending from one of said opposite edges (13;14) 
and a socket (34) disposed in the other of said 

opposite edges (14;13) and adapted to accept said 
projection (35).
