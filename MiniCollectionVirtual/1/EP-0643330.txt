<ABSTRACT>
The platemaking system is a system that produces a printing 
plate by using an exposure device 8 to print on original film that has 

imposition data consisting of multiple page data imposed on 
photosensitive film. The system is equipped with page data layout 

device 2 and exposure device 8. Page data layout device 2 indicates 
page layout data that contains positioning information and size 

information of each page data for the purpose of impositioning 
multiple page data on photosensitive film. Based on that page layout 

data, each page data is laid out at the imposition position of the 
photosensitive film, imposition data is created and the indicated page 

layout data is output to exposure device 8. Exposure device 8 receives 
the page layout data via network line NL and moves the original film to 

the corresponding position in accordance with the received page 
layout data after which the exposure process is carried out. The 

device is equipped with keyboard 14 to indicate page layout data for 
the purpose of impositioning multiple page data on original film. 

Page data layout device 2 lays out corresponding page data in response 
to page layout data when the page data corresponding to the page 

number specified by page layout data is prepared and then creates 
imposition data. Further, when the page data is not prepared, page 

data layout device 2 lays out dummy page data in response to page 
layout data in place of page data and then creates imposition data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention as claimed relates to method and apparatus for creation of
imposition data, original film creation, and platemaking, where
printing plates produced are to be used in a printing process. In
particular the system and method relate to an imposition data
creation device that creates imposition data of multiple pages of data
where one or more of the pages of subsequently printed matter may
not be available yet. The system lays out dummy page data for the
missing page or pages. Further, the device uses the method for laying
out each page of page data onto an original film and transfers the
images on each original film to determined positions on a printing
plate.When creating printed matter such as, for instance, a book, a
pamphlet or a magazine, multiple pages of data such as text, patterns,
designs and characters are each recorded at prescribed positions on
an original film. Subsequently, a printing plate is created from the
original film. The plate is used to print multiple pages of printed
matter on a single piece of paper, the piece of paper may then be 
folded and some or all of its folded edges cut, to form a plurality of
sequential printed pages. For example, to create a bound book, 16
page units are printed, each 16 page unit being formed from a single
sheet of paper having 8 sections of printed matter on each side, with
two columns of four page portions. The piece of paper is folded eight
times and then cut to provide sixteen sequential pages of the book. A
plurality of these sequential sixteen page segments may be bound
together to form the book.To properly produce a single side of a sheet of paper having
eight pages printed on each side, each of page must be properly
oriented with each of the pages printed on both the front side and the
back side of the paper, so that with proper folding of the paper, the
pages wind up in sequential order after folding and cutting. Thus, for
each uncut sheet of paper, it is necessary to properly impose eight
pages or page images onto a single original film in order to produce a
printing plate which is used to print on one side of one sheet of
paper.The process of creating an original film has typically been
performed by a film stripper. A film stripper manually takes each
page, one by one and organizes the pages to produce an original film.
Thus, In order to perform the imposing process, the operator puts
each of the eight pages of data onto one original film.In contrast to this, in recent years it has become possible to use
a computer to
