<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drawbars for cycle 
trailers and is particularly applicable to cycle trailers 
although it is also suitable for trailers to be drawn by 
motorised cycles, mopeds, scooters and the like. The 
trailer may be of any form suitable to be drawn by a 
cycle and having a drawbar which is attached to and, in 
normal use, will apply some downward loading on the 
cycle. Typically the trailer will be a two-wheeled 
trailer although single wheeled trailers are contemplated. Cycles are conventionally used for personal 
transport but they may also be used for carrying or 
moving loads and a variety of cycle trailers have been 
developed for this purpose. Such trailers have usually 
attached to the cycle frame immediately below the saddle 
or to one or other of the rear forks of the frame at the 
location where the rear wheel spindle is secured in the 
forks. Because of the way in which these arrangements 
impose the load of the trailer on the cycle, they can 
make the cycle difficult to handle and manoeuvre and may 
also restrict the turning circle of the cycle/trailer 
combination. FR-A-834947 discloses a drawbar for a cycle trailer 
providing three independent axes of articulation by means 
of a first pivotal joint about a horizontal axis attached 
partway up the seat stays the cycle frame, a second 
pivotal joint about a vertical axis behind the rear wheel 
of the cycle and a third pivotal joint extending 
generally lengthwise of the drawbar. The attachment of 
the first pivotal joint to the cycle frame above the rear 
wheel axis results in a relationship which is dynamically  
 
unstable in that the drag force imposed by the trailer 
drawbar on the cycle when the cycle trailer combination 
is in forward motion tends to tip the front of the cycle 
upwards. This invention provides a draw bar for a cycle 
trailer comprising an elongate member for extending 
between a cycle and cycle trailer, an attachment device 
at one end of the member for securing the member to the 
cycle frame adjacent the rear wheel axis with a first 
pivotal joint between the attachment device and said one 
end of the member for relative rotation between the 
member and attachment device about a horizontal axis 
extending transversely of the member, a second 
attachment device at the other end of the member for 
securing the member to the cycle trailer, a second 
pivotal joint at or adjacent the other end of the member 
for articulation about a vertical axis to lie to the rear 
of the cycle in use and a third pivotal

<CLAIMS>
A draw bar (20) for a cycle trailer comprising an 
elongate member (21) for extending between a cycle and cycle 

trailer, an attachment device (23) at one end of the member 
for securing the member to the cycle frame adjacent the 

rear wheel axis with a first pivotal joint (22, 27, 28; 82-85) 
between the attachment device and said one end of the member for 

relative rotation between the member and attachment 
device about a horizontal axis extending transversely 

of the member, a second attachment device (35) at the other 
end of the member for securing the member to the cycle 

trailer, a second pivotal joint (36, 37, 38) at or adjacent the other 
end of the member for articulation about a vertical axis 

to lie to the rear of the cycle in use and a third 
pivotal joint (41, 42) having a horizontal axis to extend 

lengthwise of the member, whereby the cycle can turn with 
respect to the trailer about the second pivotal joint, heel 

with respect to the trailer about the third pivotal joint 
and can tip in a vertical plane about the first pivotal 

joint; characterised in that the attachment device for 
securing said one end of the member to the cycle frame 

has a first portion (24, 64; 86) for attachment along a length of the 
chain stay of the cycle frame and a second portion (53; 92) for 

attachment to the seat stay of the cycle frame to support 
said pivotal joint (22, 27, 28; 82-85) 

for the forward end of the elongate 
member below the chain stay so that, in use, its axis 

lies forward and below the rear wheel axis of the cycle 
to avoid the trailer imposing a moment on the cycle which 

tends to lift the front of the cycle in the static 
condition and minimising any tipping moment tending to 

lift the front of the cycle arising from the rolling 
resistance of the trailer in the dynamic condition. 
A drawbar as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the attachment device for 

connecting said one end of the elongate member to the 
chain and seat stays comprises a bracket (23), means (25, 50, 86) for  

 
securing the bracket to the chain stay and means (54, 20, 92) for 

securing the bracket to the seat stay and in that said 
first pivot connection is provided between said one end 

of the elongate member and the bracket. 
A drawbar as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the first pivotal connection 

comprises a pair of horizontal spaced lugs (26, 67) on the 
bracket, a hub (22) at said one end of the elongate member 

having a bore extending transversely to the member and a 
pivot pin (28) securing the hub between the lugs of the 

bracket. 
A drawbar as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterised in that the means for securing the bracket 

to the seat and chain stays of the cycle frame comprise 
a pair of spaced clamping members (25) secured to the bracket. 
A drawbar as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the attachment device (35) 

securing the other end of the elongate member to the 
trailer comprises a hub (36) having means (42) for securing the 

hub to a trailer in which an end part of the elongate 
member is received and secured for rotation about the 

lengthwise axis of the member to provide said third 
pivotal connection. 
A drawbar as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the second pivotal 

connection comprises a clevis and pin connection (37, 38) 
adjacent said other end of the elongate member. 
A drawbar as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in that the clevis/pin connection 

comprises a clevis formed on one part of the elongate 
member and a hub formed on another part of the member  

 
having an axis extending transversely to the member to 

locate between the arms of the clevis and a pivot pin to 
secure the hub between the arms of the clevis and to 

provide articulation about said vertical axis.
