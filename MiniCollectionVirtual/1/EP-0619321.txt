<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing preselected chemical sequences at 
known locations on a single substrate surface, comprising 


(a) exposing a selected and reactive region of the 
substrate surface, which region may or may not carry 

a monomer or monomer sequence, to an activator to 
enable the region to react with a monomer; 
(b) reacting the resulting activated substrate region 
and said monomer; 
(c) repeating steps (a) and (b) as often as 
necessary, wherein at least a portion of a said region 

is subjected to steps (a) and (b) at least twice.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for investigating polynucleotide or amino acid
sequences. The apparatus comprises diverse chemical
sequences at known locations on a single substrate
surface.The relationship between structure and activity
of molecules is a fundamental issue in the study of biological
systems. Structure-activity relationships are
important in understanding, for example, the function of
enzymes, the ways in which cells communicate with each
other, as well as cellular control and feedback systems.Certain macromolecules are known to interact
and bind to other molecules having a very specific three-dimensional
spatial and electronic distribution. Any
large molecule having such specificity can be considered
a receptor, whether it is an enzyme catalyzing hydrolysis
of a metabolic intermediate, a cell-surface protein
mediating membrane transport of ions, a glycoprotein
serving to identify a particular cell to its neighbors, 
an IgG-class antibody circulating in the plasma, an
oligonucleotide sequence of DNA in the nucleus, or the
like. The various molecules which receptors selectively
bind are known as ligands.Many assays are available for measuring the
binding affinity of known receptors and ligands, but the
information which can be gained from such experiments is
often limited by the number and type of ligands which are
available. Novel ligands are sometimes discovered by
chance or by application of new techniques for the
elucidation of molecular structure, including x-ray
crystallographic analysis and recombinant genetic
techniques for proteins.Small peptides are an exemplary system for
exploring the relationship between structure and function
in biology. A peptide is a sequence of amino acids.
When the twenty naturally occurring amino acids are
condensed into polymeric molecules they form a wide
variety of three-dimensional configurations, each
resulting from a particular amino acid sequence and
solvent condition. The number of possible pentapeptides
of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, for example,
is 205 or 3.2 million different peptides. The likelihood
that molecules of this size might be useful in receptor-binding
studies is supported by epitope analysis studies
showing that some antibodies recognize sequences as short
as a few amino acids with high specificity. Furthermore,
the average molecular weight of amino acids puts small
peptides in the size range of many currently useful
pharmaceutical products.Pharmaceutical drug discovery is one type of
research
