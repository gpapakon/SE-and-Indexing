<ABSTRACT>
In order to fasten a belt (10) to a shaft (12) of a seat belt retractor, an end region of the belt is passed through a radial slot (18) in the shaft. A rod (14, 16) which is arranged transversely to the longitudinal direction (F) of the belt is surrounded by a belt section (102). The rod (14, 16) is arranged in an extended first part (181) of the slot (18) which opens out into a narrower second part (182) of the slot (18). At least two layers of belts are held in the narrower part (182) of the slot (18) by pressure exerted in the direction of the belt thickness.

<CLAIMS>
An assembly for fastening a belt webbing (10) to a shaft 
(12) of a seat belt retractor, said shaft having a radial 

slot (18) through which one end of said belt webbing (10) 
is inserted, the belt webbing having a first section (101) 

for insertion in said slot (18), and a second section (102) 
for wrapping around a member (14, 16) oriented transversely 

to the longitudinal direction of the belt webbing (F) and 
followed by an end section (103) extending parallel to said 

first section (101), said transverse member (14, 16) is 
arranged in an expanded first part (181) of said slot (18) 

merging in a narrower second part (182) of said slot (18), 
characterized in that said first section (101) and said end 

section (103) of said belt webbing (10) are held in said 
second part (182) of said slot (18) by surface pressure 

excerted in the direction of the belt webbing thickness. 
An assembly as set forth in claim 1 wherein at least one 
spreader member (16) is intruded into said second part (182) 

and squeezes said belt webbing (10) by interacting with the 
wall defining said slot (18) in said second part (182). 
An assembly as set forth in claim 2 wherein said spreader 
member (16) is configured so that a first region of said 

spreader memeber (16) forms the transverse member and a 
second region extends into said second part (182) of said 

slot (18).  
 
An assembly as set forth in claim 3 wherein said belt 
webbing (10) directly contacts said spreader member (16) by 

its inner wrap surface. 
An assembly as set forth in claim 4 wherein said end 
section (103) of said belt webbing (10) is wrapped around 

the free end of said spreader member (16) arranged in said 
slot (18). 
An assembly as set forth in claims 4 and 5 wherein 
projections (24) are provided at the free end of said spreader 

member (16), which extend in the longitudinal direction 
(F) of said belt webbing. 
An assembly as set forth in claim 6 wherein said 
projections (24) are formed by pointed teeth. 
An assembly as set forth in claim 2 wherein a bar (14) 
forms the transverse member and said spreader member (16) is 

configured so that a first region of said spreader member 
surrounds said bar (14) and a second region extends into 

said second part (182) of said slot (18). 
An assembly as set forth in claim 8 wherein said belt 
webbing (10) is in direct contact with said bar (14) by its 

wrapping inner surface, said spreader member (16) is 
configured U-shaped and both arms (161, 162) of said 

spreader member (16) clasp said sections (101, 102, 103) of 
said belt webbing (10). 
An assembly as set forth in claim 9 wherein said 
spreader member (16) has wedge-shaped projections oriented 

in the direction of the wall defining said slot (18).  
 
An assembly as set forth in claims 2 to 10 wherein the 
surface of said spreader member (16) in contact with said 

belt webbing (10) features holding means (22, 26, 28, 30) to 
counteract movement of said belt webbing (10) relative to 

said spreader member (16). 
An assembly as set forth in claim 11 wherein said 
holding means (22, 26, 28, 30) have a sawtooth cross-section. 
An assembly as set forth in claims 11 or 12 wherein the 
surface of said spreader member (16) in contact with said 

belt webbing (10) is provided projections (28). 
An assembly as set forth in claims 11 to 13 wherein said 
holding means are formed by ribs (28) oriented transversely 

to the longitudinal direction (F) of said belt webbing. 
An assembly as set forth in any of the above claims 
wherein the surface of said spreader member (16) is provided 

roughened, particularly knurled. 
An assembly as set forth in any of the above claims 
wherein said transverse member (14) is formed wedge-shaped. 
An assembly as set forth in any of the above claims 
wherein said slot (18) is shaped to match at least in part 

the outer contour of the unit comprising said spreader 
member (16), transverse member (14) and belt webbing (10) 

and engaging said slot (18). 
An assembly as set forth in claims 16 to 17 wherein 
between said first part (181) of said slot (18) and the 

second part (182) of said slot (18) an intermediate part 
(183) tapered from said first part (181) in the direction of 

said second part (182) is provided.
