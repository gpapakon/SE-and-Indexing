<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly 10 is provided which includes a gimbal-like 
structure permitting rotation of a mounting member 25 

relative to the housing 20. The rotation of the mounting 
member allows the seal member 28 to align with an 

instrument being inserted therethrough. The seal assembly 
is adapted to be detachably mounted to a cannula assembly 

for use in endoscopic surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seal systems which are adapted to allow the
introduction of surgical instrumentation into a patient's body. In particular, the invention
is applicable to a cannula assembly wherein a cannula housing includes or is adapted to
receive a seal assembly to sealingly accommodate instruments of different diameters
inserted through the seal assembly and cannula. A seal assembly which has the technical features of the
pre-characterising parts
of claims 1, 9 and 11 below is disclosed in WO93/01850.In laparoscopic procedures surgery is performed in the interior of the
abdomen through a small incision; in endoscopic procedures surgery is performed in any
hollow viscus of the body through narrow tubes or cannula inserted through a small
entrance incision in the skin. Laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures generally require
that any instrumentation inserted into the body be sealed, i.e. provisions must be made to
ensure that gases do not enter or exit the body through the incision as, for example, in
surgical procedures in which the surgical region is insufflated. Moreover, laparoscopic
and endoscopic procedures often require the surgeon to act on organs, tissues, and vessels
far removed from the incision, thereby requiring that any instruments used in such
procedures be relatively long and narrow.For such procedures, the introduction of a tube into certain anatomical
cavities such as the abdominal cavity is usually accomplished by use of a trocar assembly
comprised of a cannula assembly and an obturator assembly. Since the cannula assembly
provides a direct passage for surgical instrumentation from outside the patient's body to
access internal organs and tissue, it is important that the cannula assembly maintain a
relatively gas-tight interface between the abdominal cavity and the outside atmosphere.
The cannula assembly thus generally includes a cannula attached to a cannula housing 
containing a seal assembly adapted to maintain a seal across the opening of the cannula
housing.Since surgical procedures in the abdominal cavity of the body require
insufflating gases to raise the cavity wall away from vital organs, the procedure is usually
initiated by use of a Verres needle through which a gas such as CO2 is introduced into the
body cavity, thereby creating a pneumoperitoneum. Thereafter, the pointed obturator of
the obturator assembly is inserted into the cannula assembly and used to puncture the
abdominal wall. The gas provides a positive pressure which raises the inner body wall
away

<CLAIMS>
A seal assembly (10) adapted to allow passage of an elongate
surgical instrument along an axis of the assembly, which

comprises:

a mounting member (25);
an apertured resilient seal member (28) mounted to said
mounting member; and
a housing (20), said mounting member being rotatably
mounted within said housing;

the seal assembly being characterised in that:

said mounting member (25) includes a convex, arcuate outer
face (30) which extends around an axis of the mounting member (25),

and said housing (20) includes a concave ring-like track (32), and
said arcuate outer face (30) of said mounting member (25) is adapted to

cooperate with and rotate on said concave ring-like track (32) of
said housing (20) for changing an angle of the mounting member axis

relative to the longitudinal axis of the housing (20).
The seal assembly of claim 1, further comprising at least one
guide wall (24) to guide a surgical instrument through said

seal member (28).
The seal assembly of claim 1 or 2, further comprising a
limiting ring (34) which limits the rotation of said mounting

member (25) to up to about 25 degrees with respect to the
longitudinal axis defined by said housing (20).
The seal assembly of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the seal member
(28) is conical with its aperture (26) at the apex of the cone.
The seal assembly of any one of the preceding claims, further
comprising at least one seal protector (40) positioned

adjacent said seal member (28). 
The seal assembly of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said housing (20) further includes a bellows structure (36)

therewith, said bellows structure being associated with said
mounting member (25).
The seal assembly of claim 6, as dependent on claim 4, wherein
the bellows structure (36) surrounds the conical seal member

(28).
The seal assembly of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said seal member (28) is fabricated from a resilient material

and is adapted to accommodate instruments ranging in diameter

from 4 to 15mm.
In combination:

(a) a cannula assembly (12) which includes a cannula housing
(16) and a cannula (14), said cannula housing (16) including a

valve assembly (18) which is adapted to provide a fluid-tight
seal; and
(b) a seal assembly (10) associated with said cannula housing (16)
characterised by said seal assembly having a structure

as claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
The combination of claim 9, wherein said seal assembly (10) is
detachably mounted to said cannula housing (16).
A cannula assembly comprising a cannula (14) and a housing (16) therefor,
said cannula housing (16)

being associated with a seal assembly (10) having in a housing
(20) thereof

an apertured resilent seal member (28)
adapted to allow passage of an elongated surgical instrument

into and out of the cannula (14) while sealing around the
instrument, and
characterised in that

the seal member (28) is gimbal-mounted within the housing (20) of the
seal assembly (10).
