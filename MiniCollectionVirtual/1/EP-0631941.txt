<ABSTRACT>
Plastic container (packaging box), formed by a rigid receptacle (2) and a lid (3), both having a peripheral rim in the shape of an inverted U, formed by two, respectively inner and outer, branches, the two outer branches being surrounded by a welded annular strip on the periphery and including rupture notches, characterised in that, on one side of the receptacle (2) and of the lid (3), the notches are discontinuous in order thereby to define, in the stacking arrangement, a non-detachable region (45) intended, after tearing off the detachable strip, to form a hinge for the lid (3) to pivot on the receptacle (2).

A plastic packaging box (1) which comprises a rigid 
tub (2) and a cover (3) wherein : 


the tub (2) comprises an aperture (5) bounded by a 
peripheral rim (6) assuming the shape of an upended U and 

consists of two arms respectively an inner arm (7) linked 
to the body of the tub proper, and an external arm (8), 

the external arm (8) being extended by a first injection-molded 
lateral, annular strip (9), of which the junction 

zone (10) to the external arm (8) comprises a rupture-initiating 
notch (11) ; 
the cover (3) comprises a peripheral rim (20) also 
assuming the shape of an upended U complementary with the 

U of the tub, and designed to nest with this tub (2) 
peripheral rim (6), of which the outer arm (23) also is 

extended by a second injection-molded annular strip (25), 
of which the junction zone (26) to the outer arm (23) 

comprises a second rupture-initiating notch (27); 
 
and wherein : 


the two annular strips (8, 25) are superposed in such 
manner that the notches (8, 27) of each annular strip (9, 

25) will de superposed and then the strips are welded 
together along their entire outer peripheral rim defining 

a stacked structure (30) to ensure the box is sealed ; 
the staked structure (30) of the two welded (31, 32), 
annular strips (9, 25) comprises a first rupture line 

(40) running transversaly from the outer stacking rim 
(32) to the vicinity of the zone (10, 26) comprising the 

rupture-initiating notches (11, 27) to make it possible 
to tear (50, 51) and separate this staked structure (30); 
 
is 
characterized
 in that on one side of the tub and cover, 
the rupture-initiating notches (11, 27) are separated by a 

segment having an absence of notches to define thereby a 
permanently attached zone (45) within the stacked structure 

(30) so that, following tearing the detachable strip (40), a 
hinge shall be formed for the cover (3) to pivot about the 

tub (2).  
 
Packaging box of claim 1 
characterized
 in that the 
zone (40) forming a hinge extends along a large side of the 

cover (3) and the tub (2), and in the fact that the side 
opposite the cover comprises a gripping tab (55) which allows 

the cover (3) may be gripped to lift. 
Packaging box of claims 1 and 2 
characterized
 in that 
the cover (3) and the tub (2) are made in the same plastic. 
Packaging box of claim 3 
characterized
 in that the 
rupture-initiating notches (11, 27) are formed by injection-molded. 
Packaging box of claims 1 to 4 
characterized
 in that 
the permanently attached zone (45) acting as a hinge is 

present over a large part of the cover and tub and is bounded 
on each side by a transverse rupture-initiating line (46, 47) 

for the purpose of separating the mutually welded lateral, 
peripheral strips (50, 51). 
Packaging box of claims 1 to 5 
characterized
 in that 
the lateral strip (25) of the cover comprises in the vicinity 

of the inner end (29) of the welded zone (31) thinner and 
spaced segments (59) which will act as the hinges proper. 
Packaging box of claims 1 to 6 
characterized
 in that 
the cover and tub side opposite the side of the permanently 

attached zone (45) respectively comprise : 

on the tub rim (6), a housing (56) 
on the cover (3), a gripper tab (55) housed in a 
housing (56).
