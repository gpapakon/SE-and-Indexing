<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display comprises a nematic liquid crystal layer (12) 
disposed between alignment layers (10,11). The alignment layers (10,11) 

are formed on substrates (6,7) which also carry display control 
electrodes (8,9) connected to a drive circuit (3). Polarisers (1,4) are 

provided on opposite sides of the substrates (6,7). The alignment layers 
(10,11) are arranged such that the liquid crystal molecule pretilt 

direction is the same (parallel) on both surfaces of the alignment 
layers (10,11). The liquid 

crystal layer (12) has a retardance equal to (M+1)λ/2 at a first 
operating 

voltage and Mλ/2 at a second operating voltage, where M is an 
integer 

greater than zero or less than minus one and λ is a wavelength 
of visible light. In another embodiment, the display includes a phase 

plate (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a liquid crystal display, for instance of the active
matrix drive type. The invention also relates to a liquid crystal device
which may be used in displays or in other applications with visible light
or other optical radiation.Twisted nematic liquid crystal displays are widely used as numeral
segment type displays for watches and pocket calculators. For high
information content displays active elements, such as thin film transistors,
are formed on the transmitting substrate of the liquid crystal display
element and function as switching elements for selectively driving the
picture element electrodes which apply voltages to the liquid crystal.
Red, green and blue colour filter layers are used to provide a colour
display.The well known high information content liquid crystal display systems
are:
(a) the active drive twisted nematic (hereinafter referred to as TN)
liquid crystal display system, characterised by the 90° twisted orientation
of the nematic liquid crystal molecules; and(b) the multiplex driven super-twisted nematic (hereinafter referred
to as STN) liquid crystal display system, which uses the sharpness of
transmittance vs. voltage applied to the liquid crystal characteristics
found by setting the nematic liquid crystal molecule twist angle to 180°
or more.Since the multiplex drive STN liquid crystal display system causes
specific colouring, an optical compensator is provided for black-and-white
displays. Liquid crystal displays of this type are classified into two
subgroups by the type of applied optical compensator, namely: (b-1) the
double-super-twisted nematic liquid crystal display system, which uses a
display liquid crystal cell and a liquid crystal cell inversely twisted; and
(b-2) the film compensated liquid crystal display system, which utilises an
optically anisotropic film. Owing to smaller weight and lower cost, the
(b-2) film compensated liquid crystal display system is preferred.Active drive TN liquid crystal display systems as described at (a) above
are divided into two groups, namely: (a-1) the normally black system
characterised by parallel arrangement of the polarisation directions of
paired polarising plates to provide black indication while no voltage is
applied to the liquid crystal layer (OFF state); and (a-2) the normally
white system characterised by mutual orthogonal arrangement of the
polarisation directions to provide white indication in the OFF state. It is
considered that the normally white display system is superior in display
contrast,
