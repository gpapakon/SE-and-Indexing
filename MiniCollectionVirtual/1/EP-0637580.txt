<ABSTRACT>
A 1-bromoalkylbenzene derivative is prepared by reacting a 
phenylalkene derivative with hydrogen bromide in the presence of a 

non-polar solvent. The phenylalkene derivative is prepared by reacting 
an alkenyl halide with metal magnesium to form a Grignard reagent, 

and then reacting the Grignard reagent with a benzyl halide derivative. 
An allyl Grignard reagent is prepared by reacting continuously an allyl 

halide derivative with metal magnesium in an organic solvent, in 
which the allyl halide derivative and metal magnesium are 

continuously added to the reaction system and the allyl Grignard 
reagent formed is continuously removed from the reaction system. 

The processes provide the intended compounds in high yields, high 
selectivities and high purities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a 1 -
bromoalkylbenzene derivative. The invention also relates to a process
for preparing a phenylalkene derivative on which the process for
preparing the 1-bromoalkylbenzene derivative is based.1-Bromoalkylbenzene derivatives are useful substances as
intermediates for medicines, agrochemicals, etc. For example, they
can be important intermediates of the compound of the formula:

which is useful as a medicine.A 1-bromoalkylbenzene derivative of the general formula:

wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a lower
alkoxy group, and n is an integer of 1 to 8, 
may be prepared by reacting a phenylalkene derivative of the general
formula:

wherein R and n are the same as defined above,
with hydrogen bromide. However, when the reaction of the
phenylalkene derivatives of the general formula (X) with hydrogen
bromide is carried out by conventional methods, for examples, using
(1) an aqueous hydrobromic acid solution, or (2) a hydrobromic acid
solution in acetic acid or propionic acid, there are problems that the
reaction does not proceeds, or the selectivity of the 1 -
bromoalkylbenzene of the general formula (IX) is low and the isomer of
the general formula:

wherein R and n are the same as defined above,
is by-produced.On the other hand, it is known to prepare the phenylalkene of
the general formula (X) in which R is H and n is 2 in the following two
ways: One process comprise the step of reacting phenethyl magnesium
bromide with vinyl chloride in the presence of nickel acetylacetonate
to obtain 4-phenyl-1-butene. The other process comprises the steps
of reacting toluene with 1,3-butadiene in the presence of sodium to
form 5-phenyl-2-pentene and then reacting it with ethylene in the 
presence of tetrabutyl tin and rhenium oxide to obtain 4-phenyl-1 -
butene.However, both of the above processes are not satisfactory
since they use sodium which is difficult to handle industrially, or use
expensive catalysts.It is known to prepare an allyl Grignard reagent in the
following two ways: One process comprises the step of adding one
mole of allyl chloride to 2.4 moles of magnesium in tetrahydrofuran
which is cooled to -15°C over a period of 12 hours to obtain allyl
magnesium chloride. The other process comprises the step of adding
dropwise one mole of allyl bromide to 2.4 mole of magnesium in
tetrahydrofuran which is cooled to 0°C over a period of 17 hours to
obtain allyl magnesium bromide.However, the processes use a large amount of
