<ABSTRACT>
A method and means to establish and maintain a micro-biologically clean environment in rooms, at which ceilings, wall surfaces and eventually other surfaces in a room, preferably after a preceding sanitation, are coated with a layer of a composition of materials which is porous, open for diffusion and preventing condensation, including granules of organic or expanded inorganic materials and binders, and at which a water soluble sanitation liquid is spread on the porous composition of materials at repeated intervals of time, at which the composition of materials remains a sanitizer in the pore system of the composition of materials as its water is evaporated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND MEANS TO BRING ABOUT AND MAINTAIN A MICRO-BIOLOGICALLY CLEAN ENVIRONMENT IN ROOMSTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention concerns a method and a means to bring about and maintain a micro-biologically clean environment in rooms by coating of the wall surfa¬ ces and any other surfaces in a room with a, in this con¬ nection, new composition of materials and a treatment of the same.BACKGROUND TECHNICSActivities with high demands on hygiene e.g. food industries, hospitals, laboratories etc. are regu¬ larly cleaned by different types of sanitizers. The de- mands on hygiene also lead to that a stress is laid on the materials which are used as lining in ceilings, walls and floors. The predominant conception is that only hard, smooth and non-porous materials -should be used on surfa¬ ces in this type of rooms. If possible tiles, stainless plate, epoxy paints should be used, but by reason of costs also simplier in-door paints such as bright latex paints, oil and alkyd paints etc. These materials are simple to wash from visible contaminants but has conside¬ rable drawbacks from the point of sanitation. It is a known but disregarded fact that painted surfaces in a room never can be completely diffusion tight. Also at the application of the paint layer craters and pores arise and when the paint is aged cracks arise. Additionally the equipment of the room demands that screws, nails, pipes, cables, ventilation ducts etc. are attached to and brought through the painted surfaces.Food industries as a rule has a high air humi¬ dity. The vapour pressure in the room by that as a rule is higher than in the surrounding ceilings, walls and floors. Consequently a diffusion of vapour occurs in all openings in the painted coating of the surface, (also microscopical), at which the vapour condensates in the 

 wall behind the coating of the surface. The condensated moist which is transferred into a liquid state cannot in the same easy way move back through the tight coating of the surface as the vapour pressure in the room drops. The walls in rooms with a high air humidity as a rule contain an excess of humidity. This humidity makes a good condi¬ tion for the growth of micro-organisms and in humid loca¬ tions this growth behind the paint layers is a problem. The rooms are daily cleaned in that floors, walls and equipment are washed with a high pressure washer, after which the surfaces, which are to be kept free from micro-organisms, are treated with a sanitizer. At this sanitation the major part of the sanitizers which

CLAIMS
1. A method to establish and maintain a micro- biologically clean environment in rooms, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that ceilings, wall surfaces and even- tually other surfaces in a room, preferably after a pre¬ ceding sanitation, are coated with a layer of a composi¬ tion of materials which is porous, open for diffusion and preventing condensation, including granules of organic or expanded inorganic materials and binders, and that a wa- ter soluble sanitation liquid is spread upon the layer of the porous composition of materials at repeated intervals of time, which as the water in the sanitation liquid has evaporated remains a sanitizer in the pore system of the composition of materials. 2. A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the sanitation is carried out by means of at least two types of sanitizers which are used alternatively at intervals of 1 - 12 months.
3. Means for carrying out the method according to claim 1 or 2 to bring about a micro-biologically clean environment in rooms, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that it comprises a porous, moist-adsorbing composition of ma¬ terials including granules of organic or expanded inorga¬ nic materials, which is brought in a layer on ceilings, wall surfaces and eventually other surfaces in a room, and a water soluble sanitation liquid, which is spread on the composition of materials and which, as its water is evaporated, remains a sanitizer in the pore system of the composition of materials. 4. Means according to claim 3, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the composition of materials com¬ prises one or more porous materials such as perlite, zeo¬ lite, bentonite, micronized silicon dioxide or christo- balite. 5. Means according to claim 3 or 4, c h a ¬ r a c t e r i z e d in that the composition of materials comprises one or more materials with a capability to take 


up water molecules directly from the surrounding air, such as salts, silicon dioxide gel, starch or derivates of cellulose, gypsom, alkali silicate, aluminium silicate or fullers earth. 6. Means according to any of the claims 3-5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the composition of materials comprises one or more water insoluble fungici¬ des and bactericides such as N-aryl-amide, alkylarylsul- phone acid, chloromethylisothiazolinone, methylisothia- zolinone, iodinated alkyn-alkyl-karbamate, 1.2-benziso- thiazol-3(2H)-one separately or in different combina¬ tions.
7. Means according to any of the claims 3-6, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the sanitizer mainly is active in water and inactive in a dry condition such as diecyl dimetyl ammoniumchloride, sodium orto fenyl- fenate tetrahydrate, glutaraldehyde, chloromethyliso- thiasolinone separately or in different combinations.
8. Means according to any of the claims 3-7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the composition of materials has a capability to quickly adsorbe and desorb liquids.
9. Means according to any of the claims 3-8, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the concentration in water of the sanitizers are preferably 150 - 500 ppm and are gradually increased in this interval at the sanita¬ tion work going on.
