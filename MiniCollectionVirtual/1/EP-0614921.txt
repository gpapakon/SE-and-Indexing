<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crosslinked polymers derived from 
the polymerization of unsaturated polyoxyethylene monomers and to 
soft contact lenses prepared from said polymers. Soft hydrogel contact lenses are currently the lens design of 
choice for extended wear applications. These lenses are derived 
from the polymerization of a hydrophilic monomer such as 
hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). A contact lens composed of the polymerization reaction product 
of HEMA (polyHEMA) is swollen in water to prepare a hydrogel. For 
conventional higher water-containing hydrogels the water content 
of the hydrogel lens is an important factor in patient comfort 
because the permeability of oxygen through the lens is proportional 
to its water content. Since the cornea of a contact lens wearer 
needs oxygen for metabolism, the water content of the lens, and 
hence its oxygen permeability, are important factors in achieving 
an acceptable degree of wearer comfort and corneal health. Although polyHEMA lenses can be swollen with water to prepare 
hydrogels with minimally acceptable water contents and oxygen 
permeability, lenses composed of polyHEMA alone do not have 
adequate mechanical properties for routine handling and care. 
Therefore, commercially available contact lenses contain not only 
HEMA, but also a crosslinking monomer to enhance the mechanical 
properties of the finished lens. The crosslinking monomer usually 
used is ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). While the  
 
crosslinking monomer improves the mechanical properties of the 
finished lens, and therefore enhances the handleability of the 
lens, it also has adverse consequences. Conventional crosslinking 
agents reduce the water content of the finished lens and increase 
its brittleness. The reduced water content lowers the permeability 
of oxygen through the lens, which in turn decreases patient comfort 
over an extended period of wear. The increase in brittleness of 
the lens makes the lens more fragile, and therefore more susceptible 
to tearing. Since neither polyHEMA alone nor the reaction product of HEMA 
with a crosslinking agent has produced optimum properties for a 
soft contact lens, commercially available lenses typically 
incorporate additional monomeric components from which the lens is 
derived. For example, anionic monomers such as methacrylic acid 
(MAA) are added to increase the water content of the lens, and 
hydrophobic monomers such as alkyl (meth)acrylates, are added to 
enhance mechanical properties of the lens. However, there
