<ABSTRACT>
An improved color picture tube (8) 
includes an evacuated glass envelope (10) having a 

faceplate panel (12) with a cathodoluminescent 
screen (22) comprising different color-emitting 

phosphor elements disposed thereon. The panel 
includes a shadow mask-frame assembly (30) mounted 

therein by support means (34) located at 
peripherally spaced positions within the panel. 

The shadow mask (24) includes an apertured portion 
(25), the apertures of which are in register with 

the phosphor elements of the screen. The support 
means at each spaced position includes a stud (44) 

attached to the glass envelope, a spring (46) 
having an aperture (60) therein for engaging the 

stud, and a plate (48) welded between the spring 
and the mask-frame assembly. The improvement 

comprises mechanically joining the spring and the 
plate by extrusions interlocking the parts together 

at two-spaced apart locations (50, 51) along one 
edge (52) of the parts, whereby the spring and the 

plate are in contact along at least a portion of 
the facing surfaces thereof. The interlocking 

extrusions render the spring and plate resistant to 
shock induced movement, thereby minimizing 

misregister between apertures in the mask and the 
phosphor elements of the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color picture 
tubes of the type having a shadow mask attached to 
a peripheral frame which is suspended in relation 
to a cathodoluminescent screen comprising blue-emitting, 
green-emitting and red-emitting phosphor 
elements and, more particularly, to improved means 
for supporting a mask-frame assembly in such a tube 
so that electron beams, generated by an electron 
gun, impinge upon the proper phosphor elements. In most current color picture tube types, 
a peripheral frame, supporting a shadow mask, is 
suspended in a faceplate panel by means of springs 
that are welded either directly to the frame or to 
plates which in turn are welded to the frame. In 
the directly welded version, the springs are 
usually made of bimetallic materials; and in the 
plate version, the plates are bimetallic. As the 
springs or plates become heated by transfer of heat 
from the mask through the frame, the bimetallic 
materials expand differently, thereby bending the 
springs or plates to cause movement of the mask-frame 
assembly toward a screen disposed on the 
panel. It is also known to use the geometric 
structure of the springs to cause this same motion 
towards the screen by action of the force of the 
expanding mask-frame assembly against the springs. It is common to use either three or four 
springs to support a mask-frame assembly within a 
rectangular faceplate panel of a tube. In a three-spring 
support system, one spring is usually 
located at the upper center of the mask, and the 
other two springs are located along the sides of 
the tube between the centers of the sides of the 
mask and the lower two corners of the mask. In a 
four-spring support system, springs are usually  
 
located at the top and bottom centers of the mask 
and at the left and right centers of the mask. In 
both the three- and four-spring support systems, as 
described above, it is possible for the mask-frame 
assembly to twist slightly and shift relative to 
the faceplate, during tube manufacture and/or 
operation. A known means for minimizing twisting 
and shifting of a mask-frame assembly uses spring 
supports at the four corners of the frame. A problem with the above-described 
structures for the plate version is that it is 
difficult to nondestructively evaluate the quality 
of the welds used to attach the springs to the 
plates, and the plates to the frame. Defective 
welds may fail due to thermal or mechanical shock, 
and the welding operation may generate weld splash, 
i.e., metal particles expelled
