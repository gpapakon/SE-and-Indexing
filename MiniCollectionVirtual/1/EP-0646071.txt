<ABSTRACT>
Blind with a powered rolling mechanism comprising a bracket (1 and 2) for a rolling member (3), blind fabric (4) secured at one end to the rolling member and at the other end to a drawing rod (5), means for deploying and returning the fabric (4) comprising two links (12, 13) between the drawing rod (5) and the runners (7, 8) sliding along a rail (6), a device (9) for driving each runner simultaneously and in the opposite direction along the rail (6), in which each link (12, 13) comprises at least one leg element (14, 15) articulated to said corresponding runner (7, 8) and a head element (16, 17) sliding in the element and capable of passing from a retracted position to an extended position. A resilient return member (18) attached between the two elements (14, 16, 15, 17) of each link tends to place the latter in its extended position. The head element (16, 17) is attached to a member (22, 23) for controlling its retraction against the effect of the return member (18) actuated by shifting of the corresponding runner during the last part of the return travel of the blind fabric (4).
