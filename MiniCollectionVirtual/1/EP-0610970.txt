<ABSTRACT>
A camera (52) comprises detection means (21) for 
detecting a signal representative of set information 

from an information supplying apparatus (51), first 
control means for performing a particular camera 

operation on the basis of the result of the detection 
by the detection means (21), and second control means for 

performing a preset initial camera operation when the 
detection by the detection means (21) has never been 

effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a camera capable of 
giving and receiving signals between it and an 
information supply apparatus. Heretofore, in program AE, the shutter speed 
and the aperture value have corresponded at one to 
one to an EV value. However, depending on the 
purpose of photographing or the object to be 
photographed, it is sometimes desirable to choose a 
particular shutter speed (or aperture value). 
Therefore, there has been proposed a camera having a 
plurality of program lines and used with the program 
lines changed over. However, depending on the purpose of 
photographing, it has sometimes been difficult to 
judge which of the program lines should be chosen. 
For example, when a close-up photograph of flowers is 
to be taken, if the photograph is directed to the use 
as a record, it is desirable to stop down the lens as 
much as possible and make the depth of field deep, 
and if the photograph is directed to the expression 
of the beauty of the flowers, it is often desirable 
to make the depth of field shallow. To judge this,  
 
it is necessary to know what effect the aperture 
gives the photograph. Also, the depth of field 
varies greatly from lens to lens and therefore, it is 
necessary to know the effect thereof. Also, the prior-art camera has a wide variety 
of program lines and therefore need have indicating 
means and input means for the change-over of the 
program lines, and this has led to the problem that 
the indication and operation become more complicated 
than in the case of a single program. One aspect of this invention is to provide a 
camera which is designed to perform a preset initial 
operation when a signal from an information supply 
apparatus is never detected and which can therefore 
always perform the photographing operation. Figures 1A and 1B are pictorial views of a 
camera body and a code reading apparatus according to 
an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 2 is an illustration showing a state 
in which a bar code list used is being read by a code 
reading apparatus. Figure 3 is a diagram showing the circuit 
construction of the embodiment.  Figures 4A and 4B are enlarged views of the 
bar code list. Figure 5, consisting of Figs. 5A, 5B and 5C, is a 
flow chart. Figure 6 is a flow chart. Figure 7 is a flow chart. Figures 1A and 1B are pictorial views of a 
camera body 52 and a code reading and supplying 
apparatus 51 according to an embodiment of the 
present invention. Figure 1A shows a state in which
