<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control 
system for the alarms of a patient 

monitoring apparatus, comprising a 
user interface (2, 7) for feeding the 

proceedings of an operation and 
physiological data of a patient into 

the electronic memory of a monitoring 
apparatus (1). The patient monitoring 

apparatus (1) is fitted with a 
surgical report interface which 

provides information about the 
varying stages of an operation, such 

information being used for 
controlling the alarm functions of 

the monitoring apparatus (1) itself. 
The surgical report software can be 

built in integral linkage with the 
patient monitoring apparatus (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system for the 
alarms of a patient monitoring apparatus, comprising a 
user interface for feeding the proceedings of an operation 
and physiological data of a patient into the electronic 
memory of a monitoring apparatus. An object of the invention is to further develop such a 
system in a manner that the control for the alarms of a 
patient monitoring system can be performed on the basis of 
data included in a patient information system. In the operating theatre and intensive care environment, 
one of the major limitations in the reliability and 
accuracy of alarms issued by a patient monitoring system 
is the fact that the monitoring device must base an alarm 
decision on electronic signals containing just limited 
information. Neither is it often possible to make sure 
that the connection to a patient is in order; for example, 
the sampling tube for respiratory gases may sag on the 
floor and, thus, no gas content information will be 
obtained. Both the parameters to be monitored and the importance 
thereof as alarm sources vary widely according to which 
stage of an operation is in progress. At the initial 
stage, for example, the gas monitoring is difficult and 
often unnecessary as the patient has not been intubated. 
Immediately after the intubation, however, the gas 
monitoring is of extreme importance. Likewise, when the 
circulation of a patient is supported by a cardiac 
respiratory machine, the alarm criteria are essentially 
different; after all, at that time the heart is  
 
deliberately stopped, a situation that would otherwise 
lead to a top priority alarm. It is known as such that a patient monitoring device can 
be informed by the user as to which stage of an operation 
is in progress or which type of alarm logic would be 
desirable. However, this type of system is inconvenient as 
it means extra work for the user and is easily overlooked. The automatic identification of an operative stage is not 
generally successful, either. The events of operative proceedings are routinely 
documented in a surgical report. The above-described 
problem is overcome by the invention in such a manner that 
a patient monitoring device is fitted with a surgical 
report interface which provides information about the 
varying stages of an operation, such information being 
used for controlling the alarm functions of the monitoring 
device itself. In other words, the automatically or 
routinely performed preparation of a surgical report is 
linked with a patient
