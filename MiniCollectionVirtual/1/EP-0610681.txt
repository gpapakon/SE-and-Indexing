<ABSTRACT>
The contact holder comprises a cylindrical body 
(2) of electrically insulating material formed 

with a plurality of seats (4, 6, 8) which can 
receive respective contacts (10). The body (2) has 

a first group of seats (4) located in a radial 
outer position and a second group of seats (6) 

located in a radially inner position. The body has 
an aperture (18) disposed in a radially inner 

position relative to the seats (4) of the first 
group. Each seat (6) of the second group 

communicates with the aperture (18) via a 
respective radial slot (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
contact holder for a socket or for a plug of a
connector for electrically connecting a towing
vehicle and a towed vehicle.More precisely, the invention relates to
a contact holder of the type defined in the
preamble of Claim 1, which is known from the
document EP-A-0 444 478.The document EP-A-0 444 478 illustrates a
contact holder comprising a cylindrical body of
electrically insulating material formed with a
plurality of seats (in this particular case
thirteen) which can receive respective contacts. A
first group of seats (in this particular case nine
seats) is located in a radially outer position,
the seats communicating with the circumferentially
outer side of the body via respective radial
slots. The contact holder body also has a group of
seats disposed in a radially inner position. Each
seat belonging to the radially inner group
communicates with a respective seat of the outer
group via a radial slot. In this way, each contact
can be placed in the respective seat, whether it
belongs to the inner group or to the outer group,
by means of a radial movement relative to the body
from the outer circumferential side. The correct arrangement of each contact
must be checked when the contact holder has been
provided with the contacts and with the
corresponding conductors. If, when this is
checked, it is noted that a contact is connected
to the wrong conductor, it is necessary to
disconnect the conductor and the contact but, in
general, this is impossible if the contact in
question is not removed.The principal disadvantage of the
solution described in the above-mentioned document
EP-A-0 444 478 consists in that, in order to
remove any of the contacts located in the radially inner
position, it is also necessary to remove the
contact accommodated in the seat of the radially
outer group communicating with the seat of the
contact to be removed.The present invention has the object of
providing a contact holder of the type defined
initially which, in addition to enabling the
contacts to be assembled rapidly in the respective
seats, allows each contact to be removed
independently of the others.In accordance with the present invention,
this object is achieved by a contact holder having 
the characteristics forming the subject of the
main claim.Further characteristics and advantages of
the invention will become clear from the following
detailed description, given purely by way of non-limiting
example, with reference to the appended
drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A contact holder for a socket or for a
plug of a connector for electrically connecting a

towing vehicle and a towed vehicle, comprising a
cylindrical body (2) of electrically insulating

material formed with a plurality of seats (4, 6,
8) which can receive respective contacts (10), the

body (2) having a first group of seats (4) located
in a radially outer position and a second group of

seats (6) located in a radially inner position, in
which the seats (4) of the first group communicate

with the outer circumferential side (12) of the
body (2) via respective radial slots (14), such

that the respective contacts (10) can be mounted
from the outer circumferential side (12) by means

of a radial movement relative to the body (2),
characterized in that the cylindrical body comprises an aperture

(18) disposed in a radially inner position
relative to the seats (6) of the second group; and

in that the seats (6) of the second group
communicate with said aperture (18) via respective

radial slots (20).
A contact holder according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said aperture (18) is closed

around its entire periphery. 
A contact holder according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said aperture (18)

communicates with the outer circumferential side
(12) of the body (2) via a radial slot (22, 24)

which allows the passage of the contacts (10) by
means of a radial movement relative to the body

(2).
A contact holder according to Claim 3,
characterized in that it comprises a further seat

(8) disposed in an intermediate position between
the seats (6) of the inner group and those of the

outer group and communicating via said respective radial
slots (24, 22) with the aperture (18) of the body

(2) and with the outer circumferential side (12)
of the body (2).
A contact holder according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the aperture (18) defines a

useful manoeuvring space of dimensions which are
greater than the maximum diameter (d
1
) of each
contact (10).
A contact holder according to Claim 1,
characterized in that each seat (4,6) of the first and second group has an arcuate profile of an extent greater than 180Â° and has a diameter (d
2
) such that it can receive an anchorage portion (26) of a respective contact,
said anchorage portion (26) will engage a respective

seat (4, 6) by snap engagement, and said anchorage portion is located between a pair of
annular collars (28, 30) which will secure the contact 

(10) axially relative to the body (2) by frontal
engagement with respective edges of the seat (4,

6).
A contact holder according to Claim 1,
characterized in that it comprises a part (32) for

the lateral retaining of the contacts (10), which
part is provided with a plurality of tubular

passages (34) which can receive respective
contacts (10) and with means (36) for snap

engagement with said cylindrical body (2).
