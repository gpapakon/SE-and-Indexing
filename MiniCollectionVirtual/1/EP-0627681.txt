<ABSTRACT>
In a data processing apparatus, a decoding unit decodes 
instructions. A calculator operates N-bit data in accordance 

with the decoded results. A flag storage unit stores a 
plurality of flag groups which are changed in correspondence 

to data having different widths, based on the operated results. 
Selectors select a predetermined flag group in accordance with 

the direction of a conditional branch instruction. A branch 
judging unit judges whether a branch is taken or not by 

referring to the selected flag group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for processing data in 
accordance with programs, and particularly to such an apparatus and method provided with a 
plurality of flag groups to be changed in accordance with calculation results of a plurality of 
data having different widths. Recently, data processing apparatus such as micro computers with 16-bit or 32-bit 
MPUs (Micro Processing Units) have been realized along with the improvement of data 
processing performance and demand for higher functions. These data processing apparatus 
can calculate data having a plurality of different widths, such as 16 bits and 32 bits, and some 
of the apparatus are provided with two or more flag groups depending on the purpose of 
calculations. FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the construction of a first conventional data 
processing apparatus with two flag groups, which is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Application No. 54-117646. The apparatus is provided with an instruction decoding unit 41 
for decoding instructions, a calculator 42 for calculating 16-bit data, a first flag group  
 
43 for conditional branch judgement, a second flag group 44 for 
arithmetic operations, and a branch judging unit 45 for judging 
whether a branch is taken or not. When an instruction decoded by the instruction decoding 
unit 41 is an arithmetic operation instruction, the calculator 
42 performs an arithmetic operation. The flags in the first 
flag group and the second flag group are changed in accordance 
with the results of the operation. If the next instruction decoded by the instruction decoder 
unit 41 is an arithmetic operation instruction again, the 
calculator 42 performs another arithmetic operation by 
referring to the second flag group 44. The first and second 
flag groups 43 and 44 are changed in accordance with the 
results of the arithmetic operation. On the other hand, if the next instruction is a 
conditional branch instruction, the branch judging unit 45 
judges whether a branch is taken or not from the first flag 
group 43 for conditional branch. However, according to the first conventional data 
processing apparatus, these flag groups 43 and 44 are both 
designed for 16-bit data. Therefore, data with fewer bits must 
be extended so as to fit the data width of the calculator 42. FIGS. 2A and 2B show how 8-bit data is processed in the 
16-bit calculator 42, as an example of data extension. When two 8-bit data 88H and F8H are added (H represents 
hexadecimal), they are made into 16-bit data by
