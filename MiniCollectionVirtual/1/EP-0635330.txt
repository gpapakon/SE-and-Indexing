<ABSTRACT>
Miniaturised TIG welding torch, with enhanced efficiency, comprising a body (10) carrying:   - a cylindrical electrode (24) made of refractory material, defining one axis for the torch; - a first sleeve (42) surrounding the electrode towards the end where the arc is to be developed, delimiting a channel (44) between an inner wall (62) and the electrode (24) for the passage of a first flow of shielding gas and constituting a nozzle (converging element) for this first flow; - a second sleeve (40) surrounding the first sleeve (42), delimiting a channel between its inner wall and the outer wall of the first sleeve for the passage of a second flow of shielding gas, constituting, in association with the first sleeve, a nozzle for the second gas flow; - first means (26, 16, 28, 48) for supplying the first sleeve (42) with shielding gas; - second means (14, 30) for supplying the second sleeve (40) with shielding gas;   - means (8) for supplying electric power to the electrode; - means for centring the said electrode (24), these means being located towards the end of the electrode where the arc is to be developed.

Miniaturized torch for gas-shielded refractory-electrode 
arc welding, comprising a body (10) which 

supports: 

a cylindrical electrode (24) made of refractory 
material defining an axis for the torch and consisting of 

a cylindrical body (100) whose end where the arc is to 
develop terminates in a tip (102); 
a first sleeve (42) surrounding the electrode 
near the end of the electrode where the arc is to develop, 

delimiting a channel (44) for a first flow of shielding 
gas to pass between an inner wall (62) and the 

electrode (24); 
a second sleeve (40) surrounding the first 
sleeve (42) and delimiting, between its inner wall and 

the outer wall of the first sleeve, a channel for a 
second flow of shielding gas to pass, forming together 

with the first sleeve a combining cone for the second 
flow of gas; 
first means (26, 16, 28, 48) for supplying the 
first sleeve (42) with shielding gas; 
second means (14, 30) for supplying the second 
sleeve (40) with shielding gas; 
means (8) for supplying electric power to the 
electrode; 
means for centring the said electrode (24); 
 
characterized in that: 


the first sleeve (42) constitutes a combining 
cone for the first flow of gas; 
the centring means are located towards the end  
 

of the electrode where the arc is to develop and comprise 
a centring piece (50) which is a piece fastened to the 

body (10) of the torch and which is centred on the axis 
of the torch, the centring piece having an axial bore 

(54) for the passage and positioning of the electrode 
(24); 
the electrode (24) is held in place in the body 
(10) of the torch by pressure means; 
the end of the electrode (24) where the arc is 
to develop is covered with a layer of material (104) 

which is non-emissive at high temperature, the end of the 
tip (102) being devoid of this layer of non-emissive 

material. 
Torch according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the body (10) has an axial skirt (18), drilled with an 

axial hole (22) for the passage of the electrode (24), 
and a peripheral skirt (20) centred on the axis of the 

torch, the first sleeve (42) being fixed to the axial 
skirt (18) and the second sleeve (40) being fixed to the 

peripheral skirt (20). 
Torch according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the centring piece (50) is housed 

in the first sleeve (42). 
Torch according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the centring piece (50) is provided 

with passages for the first flow of shielding gas. 
Torch according to any one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the first flow of shielding gas is 

conveyed in the body (10) of the torch via holes (28) 
provided in the axial skirt (18). 
Torch according to any one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the second flow of shielding gas is 

conveyed via holes (30) made in the body (10) in order to 
be forwarded into a region lying between the axial skirt 

(18) and the peripheral skirt (20). 
Torch according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the combining cone of the first 

sleeve (42) makes a vertex angle of between 7° and 9°. 
Torch according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,  
 

characterized in that the second sleeve (40) includes, 
towards the end of the electrode where the arc is to 

develop, a frustoconical portion (40b) terminating in a 
cylindrical portion (40c). 
Torch according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the electrode (24) is held in place 

in the body (10) by the pressure of a spring (38), the 
electrode being supplied with electric power via a 

mechanical contact. 
Torch according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the non-emissive material is 

molybdenum. 
Torch according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the layer of molybdenum is between 5 µm and 20 µm.
