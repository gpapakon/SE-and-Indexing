<ABSTRACT>
Injector in which an obturator element (11) controlled 
by an electromagnetic actuator (7) controls the formation of 

at least one jet of fuel (15) through an atomization hole (14), 
characterized in that it is provided with auxiliary 

atomization means including at least one surface (21) arranged 
so as to be transversely oblique with respect to the said 

jet of fuel (15), at a predetermined and relatively large 
distance from the atomization hole (14) with respect to the 

jet diameter, such that the surface (21) is struck by the jet 
at a predetermined point (22) with an angle of impact other 

than 0째 and 90째, and including moreover a duct (25) for a jet 
of auxiliary air (23) oriented so as to direct the jet of air (23) 

against the said oblique surface (21), substantially at the 
point of impact (22) thereon of the said jet of fuel (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electromagnetically controlled fuel injector, in particular 
for supplying fuel to motor vehicle engines, of the 
type in which atomization of the injected fuel is 
obtained partly by effecting injection through one or 
more atomizer holes formed through a delivery element 
designed to provide a so-called "thin wall outflow" and 
partly by the delivery, through the injector, of an 
auxiliary air flow in addition to the fuel. Electromagnetic injectors for vehicle engines of 
the so-called "Pico" type are known, in which the 
obturator operated by an electromagnetic actuator 
regulates the outflow of the fuel through holes formed in 
a portion of a delivery plate or disc defined by a wall 
of very small thickness, of the order of only a few 
tenths of a millimetre or less; in this type of 
injector, atomization of the injected fuel (usually 
petrol) is achieved by means of the aero- and hydro-dynamic 
effects which occur, as is well known in 
rheology, when the outflow of a liquid (the fuel) occurs 
through a hole formed in a thin wall or through a hole 
whose length is very small compared to its diameter. In 
this way, the formation of fuel jets consisting of 
particles with a diameter of 180 to 200 microns is 
obtained; in many cases it would preferable, however, to 
obtain a greater degree of atomization, with the formation 
of particles of fuel of smaller dimensions, 
something which is not possible without being obliged to 
reduce the dimensions of the delivery holes such that 
there is the risk of blockage of the said holes, not to 
mention the associated problems relating to both the 
constructional design and premature wear of the holes 
themselves. In order to improve atomization of the jets of 
fuel produced by means of injectors it is also known, for 
example from German Patent No. 4103918, to obtain mixing 
of the jet of fuel with a jet of auxiliary air prior to 
actual injection of the fuel into the combustion chamber 
(or induction manifold) of the engine.  The results obtained hitherto, however, have not 
been entirely satisfactory; furthermore, in the case of 
the aforementioned German patent, atomization of the jet 
is obtained also by dividing up the said jet into two 
separate jets by means of impact against an edge, something 
which causes rapid wear of the atomizer device and, 
therefore, reduces the life of the injector. The aim of the invention is to provide a fuel 
injector capable of achieving a high degree of 
atomization of the injected fuel

<CLAIMS>
Injector with high atomization capacity, in 
particular for supplying fuel to motor vehicle engines, 

of the type comprising an electromagnetic actuator, a 
delivery element provided with at least one atomization 

hole, and an obturator element operated by the said 
electromagnetic actuator so as to control the formation 

of at least one jet of fuel through the said atomization 
hole, characterized in that it is provided with auxiliary 

atomization means comprising: at least one surface 
arranged so as to be transversely oblique with respect to 

the said jet of fuel, at a predetermined and relatively 
large distance from the atomization hole with respect to 

the jet diameter, such that the surface is struck by the 
jet at a predetermined point; and means for delivering a 

jet of auxiliary air oriented so as to direct the jet of 
air against the said oblique surface, substantially at 

the point of impact thereon of the said jet of fuel. 
Injector according to Claim 1, comprising a 
casing inside which the said electromagnetic actuator and 

the said obturator element are accommodated, the latter 
being mounted so as to slide parallel to an axis of 

symmetry of the casing and the casing housing moreover, 
on its end and in a position facing the obturator 

element, the said delivery element, characterized in that 
the said auxiliary atomization means are all contained in 

a cap removably mounted on the outside of the casing, in 
the region of and axially projecting from said end of the 

latter. 
Injector according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the said means for delivering the said jet of 

auxiliary air consist of at least one hole formed so as 
to pass through the said cap in the radial direction, at 

a predetermined distance in the axial direction from the 
said end of the casing. 
Injector according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the said surface arranged so as to be transversely 

oblique with respect to the jet of fuel is formed 
 

internally in the said cap, inside a delivery duct in 
which there emerges laterally the said radial hole for 

the jet of auxiliary air; the latter being oriented 
obliquely with respect to the axis of symmetry of the 

casing and the said surface being arranged so as to be 
struck by the jet of fuel with an angle of impact other 

than 0째 and 90째. 
Injector according to one of the preceding 

claims, characterized in that the said delivery element 
comprises at least one pair of atomization holes, opening 

of which for a predetermined duration is controlled by an 
axial sliding movement of the said obturator so as to 

form at least one pair of fuel jets which are not parallel 
with one another, said jets being nevertheless 

oriented in a mainly axial direction with respect to 
sliding of the obturator; and in that the auxiliary 

atomization means are formed in an atomizer element 
arranged immediately downstream of the delivery element, 

in axial abutment against the latter, and comprise: a 
chamber of predetermined dimensions which is formed 

inside the atomizer element immediately downstream of the 
delivery element and in which the said atomization holes 

emerge; a pair of ducts formed so as to pass through the 
atomizer element and arranged so as to diverge from one 

another in the direction of delivery of the fuel jets, 
from said chamber and on the opposite side to the delivery 

element, said ducts being delimited with respect to 
each other by respective lateral intrados surfaces 

arranged obliquely with respect to the jets of fuel 
supplied from the atomizer holes of the delivery element 

and the said surfaces being formed in a position such 
they are able to intercept the jets of fuel; and at least 

one pair of opposite radial holes formed so as to pass 
through the atomizer element, each of them emerging 

laterally inside a said duct, opposite the respective 
said lateral intrados surface of the latter, the said 

radial holes being connected on the outside of the 
atomizer element to a manifold receiving a flow of 

auxiliary air.
