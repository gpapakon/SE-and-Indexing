<ABSTRACT>
A paper web comprises separable edge feed portions surrounding a continuous form. The continuous form has regularly longitudinal spaced opposed paires of transvers cut lines (26, 28) extending from each web edge portion (20, 22). The pairs of transverse lines leave an uncut middle portion (30) of the web (10) and furthermore the lines extending from each marginal web portion (38, 40) are of uniform length. A perforation or score line (32, 34) runs longitudinally along the inner end of the transverse lines extending from each marginal portion (38, 40). This web construction permits the continuous form portion (24) of the web (10) to be folded in the direction of motion of the web (10) over the shortest known distance prior to cutting or separating the web (10) at the opposed pairs of lines to form folded sheets. In another embodiment, the transverse cut lines (26, 28) may be replaced by transverse perforation lines (226, 228) in which case the web is burst at these lines prior to folding. A machine (50) for forming letter shets from the paper web has a tractor feed (52), a slitter (54) for removing the pin hole (25) edges of the web (10), an in-line Z-folder (56), pinch rollers and a burster. The Z-folder (56) has a length which is one and half to two times the spacing between transverse perforation lines. The speed of the tractor feed drive (52) and pinch roller drive (58) are monitored and a sensor (76) senses each transverse cut (26, 28) so that the speed of the pinch rollers (58) may be synchronised with the tractor feed (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paper web providing a 
continuous form and to a method and an apparatus for forming 
letter sheets. Mass mailings generally rely upon apparatus to feed, 
cut and fold a continuous form into folded letter sheets for 
stuffing in an envelope. The continuous form is typically 
provided in a paper web having pin hole edges for tractor feeding 
of the web. Furthermore, the web may be perforated across its 
width at uniform intervals; in such case, the paper web is often 
referred to as "computer paper". One method of handling a paper 
web (with or without the noted transverse perforations) is as 
follows. The paper web is tractor fed to a separating station 
(if the web is transversely perforated) or a cutting station (if 
the web is not transversely perforated) and the separate sheets 
are then conveyed to a folding station whereat automatic arms 
first fold one marginal portion of the sheet over a medial 
portion of the sheet and then fold the remaining marginal portion 
of the sheet over the first mentioned marginal portion and the 
medial portion of the sheet. This results in a folded letter 
which has a standard letter fold. One drawback with this method 
is that once the individual sheets have been cut or separated 
from the continuous form it is difficult to keep them in 
registration in order to make the letter folds properly. 
Furthermore, once cut or separated, the sheets are generally 
supported underneath which makes a Z-fold for the sheets 
impossible. By way of explanation, a Z-fold results when one 
marginal portion of the sheet is folded over the medial portion 
of the sheet and the other marginal portion of the sheet is 
folded under the medial portion of the sheet. A Z-fold has an 
advantage in mass produced letters in that the address at the  
 
head of the letter may be on the marginal of the letter so that 
it may appear under a window in an envelope into which the 
letter is stuffed. A second method of forming folded letters from the 
aforenoted paper web involves tractor feeding the web and then 
buckle folding the leading portion of the web subsequent to 
which the leading portion is severed from the web resulting in 
a folded letter sheet. One drawback with this approach is that 
it cannot be used where inserts have been adhered to the web 
ahead of the buckle folding station if such inserts are of 
significant thickness. Thus, for example, this method cannot be 
used where standard thickness credit cards (which are about 0.85 
microns --30,000 of an
