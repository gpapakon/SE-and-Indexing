<ABSTRACT>
A spark plug printing machine has two silk screens 22 and 23 with different colour inks 
mounted side-by-side and facing down. Spark plug insulators 3 are rotatably mounted in a 

vertical orientation on a turntable 11. A print transfer pad 43 located beneath the screens is 
rotatable from a first position H where it is horizontal and contacts the screens to a second 

vertical position V. In the second position the pad 43 contacts one of the insulators 3 and is 
displaced along its length to roll the insulator along the pad through more than 360° so that ink 

from both screens 22 and 23 is transferred to the insulator one after the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spark plug printing machines Spark plugs are usually marked to indicate the manufacturer, type and so on by printing 
on the insulator body between the two electrodes. One example of a machine by which this 
printing can be carried out is described in US 4640188. The machine described in this patent 
specification can be used only for printing in a single colour. There are several problems in 
printing in more than one colour, such as, for example, ensuring accurate registration of the 
colours on a curved surface and of being able to carry out the printing at sufficiently high 
speeds to be economical. To date, no one has been able to provide a satisfactory machine 
capable of printing spark plug insulators reliably in more than one colour. It is an object of the present invention to provide a machine capable of printing spark 
plug insulators in more than one colour. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a spark plug printing 
machine, comprising first and second printing screens arranged 
side-by-side and each having a different colour ink, a print transfer pad that is displaceable 
from a first position in which it extends parallel to the two screens so that ink from both 
screens is transferred to the pad, to a second position, and a support member rotatably 
supporting the spark plug insulator with its longitudinal central axis parallel 
to the pad when it is in its second position so 
that the insulator can be rolled along the length of the pad and ink from both screens can be transferred 
to the insulator one after the other during rotation of the insulator through more than 360°. The printing screens are preferably mounted horizontally and facing downwardly. The 
insulator may be mounted vertically on a turntable adapted to support several insulators. The  
 
pad is preferably displaceable along its length in the second position so that the insulator is 
rolled along the pad by displacing the pad along its length. The ink may be a heat-flowable 
ink, 
the machine including heaters that heat the screens to maintain the ink flowable. The print 
transfer pad may be rotatably mounted about the axis, the pad being displaceable from the first 
position to the second position by rotating the pad about the axis. A spark plug printing machine in accordance with the present invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
