<ABSTRACT>
A moisture curable polyurethane adhesive 
composition comprises an aromatic polyisocyanate, a 

polyester polyol, a functionally effective amount of a 
plasticiser, and an optional polyether polyol. The 

aromatic polyisocyanate has an isocyanate functionality 
that does not exceed about 2.3. The polyester polyol 

may be derived from the reaction of adipic acid and a 
diol (e.g., neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, 2-methyl-1,3-propane 

diol, 2,3-methylbutane diol, or 1,2-propylene 
diol) or it may be provided by a 

polycaprolactone diol. The adhesive compositions are 
particularly useful in bonding vinyl to wood.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
polyurethane adhesives and, more particularly, to 
moisture curable, plasticized polyurethane adhesives 
that demonstrate excellent adhesion to wood and vinyl. Plastic clad wood laminates comprising a wood 
core with an outer plastic (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) 
sheath or surface are commonly used when concerns of 
durability, abrasion resistance, weatherability, 
aesthetics, cost and the like make the use of bare wood 
inappropriate or undesirable. Conventional articles 
utilizing a plastic clad wood core laminate include 
architectural members (for example, door frames, window 
frames and window sills), built-in furniture (for 
example, kitchen and bathroom cabinets and 
countertops), and free-standing articles of furniture 
(for example, desks, bookcases, tables, cabinets, 
etc.). Typically, the plastic cladding is adhesively 
bonded to the wood core. Depending on the shape of the 
finished article, its intended use, and the 
environmental conditions to which the finished article 
will be exposed, exacting demands may be placed on the 
adhesive. Compound shapes and acute angles may place 
considerable stress on both the wood core and the 
plastic cladding as well as the adhesive that bonds  
 
them together. In addition, extruded plastics may 
retain residual stresses that, upon subsequent heating, 
are permitted to relax. The relaxation can be 
manifested in shrinkage of the plastic cladding. A 
useful adhesive should enable the extruded plastic to 
resist shrinkage. The core and the plastic cladding may expand 
and contract at different rates in response to 
fluctuating temperatures. A useful adhesive should 
readily adapt to such temperature variations while 
maintaining adhesion between the core and the cladding. U.S. Patent No. 5,057,568 "Polyurethane 
Adhesives," issued October 15, 1991 to J. Nowicki et 
al., proposes an adhesive which is reportedly useful in 
such constructions. The disclosed adhesive is a 
solvented composition comprising 20 to 40% by weight of 
a diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 0.5 to 4.0% by weight 
of a caprolactone triol, 40 to 75% by weight of a 
neopentyl adipate ester diol, 0 to 10% by weight of at 
least one polypropylene oxide diol, and a functionally 
effective amount of a catalyst. Canadian Patent Application No. 2,039,305, 
published October 18, 1991 and entitled "Polyurethane 
Adhesive for PVC/Wood Laminating," discloses a heat 
resistant laminate material consisting essentially of a 
wood-containing substrate base member that is
