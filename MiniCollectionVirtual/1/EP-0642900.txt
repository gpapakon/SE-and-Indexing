<ABSTRACT>
The mixing drum 10 of a vehicle-mounted mixer is closed off at the rear by a rear flap 20 which has a feeding hopper 26. The rear flap 20 is pivotably mounted on a supporting frame 30 and can be pivoted by means of an adjustment device 54. The supporting frame 30 is supported by the mixing drum 10 via a bearing yoke 32 which is supported on a running ring 28 in a relatively rotatable manner. Deformation of the vehicle frame therefore no longer affects changes in the position of the rear flap 20 with respect to the mouth 18 of the drum.

Vehicle-mounted mixer for flowable media such as concrete 
having a mixing drum (10) which has on its outer periphery a 

running ring (14) which is rotatably supported by rollers 
(16) of a structure (12) of the vehicle frame and to which is 

allocated a rear flap (20) with a charging hopper (26) fixed 
thereto, wherein the rear flap (20) is mounted pivotably 

about a stationary pivoting bearing (46) above the drum (10) 
and is pivotable, by means of a setting device (54), between 

a closed position sealing the drum mouth (18) by means of a 
rind seal (22) and an open position and wherein the pivoting 

bearing (46) and the setting device (54) are arranged on a 
supporting mount (30), characterised in that the supporting 

mount (30) is mounted on the drum (10) rotatably relative to 
the axis of the drum (10) and has a protective device to 

prevent simultaneous rotation, that a bearing yoke (32) is 
provided which is mounted, extending axially and radially, 

by means of at least two peripherally spaced bearings (34, 
36) having rollers (58-62), on the running ring (14) of the 

drum (10) or an auxiliary running ring (28) arranged between 
the running ring (14) and the drum mouth (18), and engages 

around the running ring (14) or auxiliary running ring (28) 
along at least half of its circumference and that, in its 

topmost region, the bearing yoke (32) supports the pivoting 
bearing (46) of the rear flap (20) and that two arms (40) 

which are connected to one another by means of a cross-head 
(42) are fixed to the bearing yoke (32), the setting device 

(54) for pivoting the rear flap (20) being supported on the 
two arms (40). 
Vehicle-mounted mixer according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the bearing yoke (32) is designed as an annular ring  

 
open at the bottom, the two ends of which are arranged at 

least approximately at the same level in the lower half of 
the drum and that the bearing yoke (32) has, at or near each 

end, a lower bearing (34) on the running ring (14) or 
auxiliary running ring (28) and at least one further upper 

bearing (36) in the topmost region of the running or 
auxiliary running ring (14; 28). 
Vehicle-mounted mixer according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that compensating weights are attached to 

the bearing yoke (32) facing towards the closed side. 
Vehicle-mounted mixer according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the protective device to prevent 

simultaneous rotation (38) has a steering arrangement which 
connects the bearing yoke (32) to the structure (12) of the 

vehicle frame in an articulated manner. 
Vehicle-mounted mixer according to one of claims 1 - 4, 
characterised in that the pivoting bearing (46) of the rear 

flap (20) has an adjusting device (52) on the mouth of the 
drum (18) for adjusting the rear flap (20).
