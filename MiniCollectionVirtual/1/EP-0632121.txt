<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel antifoulant for
petrochemical processes. More particularly, it relates to an antifoulant
for petrochemical processes which can effectively prevent formation of
fouling in processes in a petrochemical plant, such as the rectification
process in an ethylene plant.In a petrochemical plant, such as an ethylene plant, distillation of
a fluid containing olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, and diolefins,
such as butadiene, has been conducted. In a process of distillation of
such a fluid, it is inevitable that the fluid is modified with heat to form
sludge by heating, for example, in a preliminary heat exchanger or a
reboiler and the sludge thus formed is adhered to the surface of heat
transfer in the preliminary heat exchanger or the reboiler or to the
surface of pipings to form fouling.As the mechanism of the formation of fouling, the following
phenomena are known. In petrochemical processes, organic
compounds which are easily oxidized, such as unsaturated
hydrocarbons like olefins and diolefins, in process fluids are led to
hydroperoxides by the dissolved oxygen. The hydroperoxides are then
decomposed with heat, particularly in the presence of a substance
having a catalytic activity, such as a metal, to form ketones, aldehydes, 
carboxylic acids and the like. These compounds are polymerized to form
sludge of oligomers and polymers.Therefore, antioxidants, such as phenolic antioxidants and amine
antioxidants, polymerization inhibitors, such as oxime inhibitors and
nitroso inhibitors, dispersants to prevent formation of sludge and
adherence of deposit, and agents in combinations of these agents, have
heretofore been used in petrochemical processes as antifoulants for the
purpose of preventing fouling described above. For examples, (1) an
antifoulant comprising a combination of aniline and t-butylcatechol
(Japanese Patent Publication Showa 59(1984)-24138, (2) an antifoulant
comprising nitrosophenol (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
Heisei 3(1991)-350147, (3) an antifoulant comprising a nitroso compound
(Japanese Patent Publication Heisei 4(1992)-26639, and (4) an antifoulant
comprising an amine compound (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No. Showa 64(1989)-13041, have been disclosed.However, because these antifoulants are added directly to a
process, they have drawbacks that coloring of the product is caused, that
unfavorable by-products are formed, and, moreover, that they are not
easy to handle, are expensive and have insufficient effect of
