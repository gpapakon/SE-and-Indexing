<ABSTRACT>
A file comprising a rectangular cover having a front 
wing (28), a rear wing (26) and a spine (24) between the wings. The file 

further has a lever arch mechanism (12) secured to the rear wing 
close to the spine to receive and retain thereon punched 

paper sheets. The side edges of the spine are inclined at 
a small angle to the lower edge of the cover. The file is 

extremely stable when standing on its lower edges. 
There are also described other files. In one the cover 
is a parallelogram with the edges of the spine and wings 

parallel and inclined to the parallel upper and lower edges 
of the cover. In another described file, the wings are in 

the shape of rectangles with the lower edge of the spine 
inclined to the side edges thereof. In a further described 

file, the edges of the spine and wings are parallel and at 
right angles to the top edge with the lower edge of the 

cover being inclined relative to the side edges of the spine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stationery. The invention is concerned with an article of stationery 
known as a "letter file", that is a file comprising a cover 
having a front wing, a rear wing and a spine between the 
wings, all having side edges and upper and lower edges with 
the side edges of the spine being connected to, or forming 
part of, the inner side edges of the wings; the file further 
comprising a mechanism mounted on a base plate which is 
attached to the rear wing close to the spine and being 
arranged to receive and retain thereon punched paper sheets. The term "mechanism" as used herein is intended to mean 
a device which comprises (i) two part members each in the 
form of an arch and optionally, a lever for moving the parts 
apart, to enable the paper sheets to be placed thereon, (a 
file with such a mechanism is normally called a "lever arch 
file") or (ii) one or more ring members having two parts 
sprung towards each other which are movable relatively by 
hand or spring operated opening device, or triggers, to 
permit the paper sheets to be threaded thereon (for convenience 
herein the term "arch" will be used for both the 
arches and the ring members - except where otherwise clear 
from the context), (a file with such a mechanism is normally 
called a "ring file") or (iii) posts on to which the paper 
sheets may be carried. The term "inclined" as used herein 
is intended to mean at an angle other than 180° or 90°.  The spine and the wings are often formed from a single 
sheet of cardboard, having score lines provided, about which 
the cardboard can fold, to separate the spine from the wings. Lever arch files and ring files with mechanisms mounted 
on the rear wing are, and have for many years been, extensively 
used in commerce for filing and storage of documentation. 
They are stored vertically, resting on the lower 
edges of the wings and spine. Such lever arch files and ring 
files suffer from an important disadvantage, viz when a lever 
arch file or ring file carries a significant amount of paper, 
it tends to collapse towards the front wing. This means that 
the lever arch files are not free standing but have to be 
supported. The support can be provided by stacking the lever 
arch files to fill shelves having end walls or by providing 
rigid, normally cardboard, box-like dust covers into which 
the files are individually received. In addition an attempt 
has been made to render the lever arch files rigid by 
providing slots in the front wing through which the arches 
can pass to

<CLAIMS>
A file comprising a cover (10) having a spine (24) with 
on either side thereof, a front wing (28) and a rear wing 

(26), all having side edges (18, 20, 22) and upper and lower 
edges (14, 16) with the side edges (22) of the spine (24) 

being connected to or forming part of the inner side edges 
of the wings; the file further comprising a mechanism (12) 

secured to the rear wing (26) close to the spine (24) and 
being arranged to receive and retain thereon punched paper 

sheets (30) characterised in that the lower edge (16a) of the 
spine (24) is inclined relative to the side edges of the 

spine so that the angle between the lower edge (16a) of the 
spine and side edge (22b) between the spine and the front 

wing is an acute angle β. 
A file as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the 
aforesaid acute angle β is between 85° and 89°. 
A file as claimed in claim 2 characterised in that the 
aforesaid acute angle β is about 88½°. 
A file as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 3 in 
which the top and bottom edges (14, 16) of the cover (10) lie 

on parallel straight lines and the side edges (18, 20) of the 
wings (26, 28) are at right angles thereto characterised in 

that the side edges (22a, 22b) of the spine (24) are inclined 
relative to the side edges of the wings (18, 20) (see Fig 1). 
A file as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 3 in 
which the top and bottom edges (14, 16) of the cover (10) lie 

on parallel straight lines and characterised in that the side 
edges (342, 344) of the wings (322, 324) are parallel to the 

side edges (316, 318) of the spine (320) and inclined to the 
top and bottom edges of the cover (see Fig 6). 
A file as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 3 in 
which all the side edges (116, 118, 142 and 144) are parallel 

and at right angles to the top edge (132) and bottom 
edges (122a, 124a) of the wings (122, 124) characterised in 

that the bottom edge of the spine (120) is inclined to the 
said side edges so that the lower edge (124a) of the rear 

wing (124) is located higher than the lower edge (122a) of 
the front wing (122)(see Fig 4). 
A file as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 3 in 
which all the side edges (242, 216, 218, 244) are parallel 

and at right angles to the top edge (232) of the cover (212)

which the wings and the spine are formed from a single sheet 

of cardboard being separated one from the another by score 
lines along the spine edges, characterised in that the cover

edges (14, 16) of the cover. 
A file as claimed in any one of the preceding claims
