<ABSTRACT>
Wiring made from a stacked film made of a stacked 
construction with bottom film (CVD-W film) 33 and top film 

(Al alloy film) 12, where surface roughness (Ra) of the 
aforementioned bottom film will be less than 100 Å and the 

crystal orientation of the aforementioned top film formed on 
this surface is controlled, CVD method therefore, and 

semiconductor device. 
Even when there is no lattice matching of the bottom 
film and top film, crystal orientation of the top film can 

be sufficiently controlled to give that targeted ((111) face 
with aluminum film), and in particular it will be possible 

to easily form stacked films with satisfactory barrier 
function as well as sufficient EM resistance and with good 

film formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a stacked film assembly
(particularly aluminum wiring that has a barrier metal layer as
the underlying film), its method of formation and a semiconductor
device (for example, dynamic random access memory: DRAM)
employing same.It is already known that when aluminum thin film is used as
wiring material, the direction of the crystal particles and
crystal particle diameter affect deterioration, e.g., wire
breakage due to electromigration (abbreviated EM hereafter).In short, the life of aluminum wiring until it disconnects
because of EM (EM resistance): MTF is expressed by the following
formula, based on experience, of S. Vaidya.
MTFα(S/σ2) log (I111/I200)3Where,
S:aluminum polycrystal grain diameterσ:variation in this crystal grain diameterI111:(111) face X-ray diffraction intensityI200:(200) face X-ray diffraction intensityAccording to the formula (1), as the crystal grain diameter
increases, variation becomes smaller, and the fact that crystal
grain orientation (phenomenon where crystal direction follows a
specific direction) is controlled by the (111) face crystal
direction is important for improving EM resistance.Prior to this, aluminum wiring has used a construction, as
shown in Figure 30, where it is applied to contact hole 4 of
insulation layer 3 on semiconductor substrate 1 as a single layer
film 12 and conducts on insulation layer 3 by connection to a
specific semiconductor region 22. With this type of single layer
aluminum wiring 12, however, aluminum atoms diffuse toward the
semiconductor substrate during annealing or heating, forming an
Al-Si alloy. Spike alloy 10 shown in Figure 30 is readily
produced, and if this reaches pn junction 11, there will be a 
problem with shorting between wiring 12 and substrate 1. Because
of this, even if the aluminum crystal diameter is controlled as
described above, EM resistance will be insufficient.So, as shown in Figure 31, barrier metal film 13, to prevent
aluminum atom diffusion, is provided beneath aluminum film 12,
and the formation of wiring with this stacked structure having
aluminum film 12 and barrier metal film 13 is widely used.The use of titanium nitride (TiN), for example, as the
barrier metal film 13 is already known. Along with the barrier
function of TiN, Al crystal orientation is controlled by
controlling the TiN crystal orientation. In other words, this
takes advantage of certain characteristics. By controlling TiN
crystal orientation to (111), Al crystal orientation will follow
the (111) face orientation. With TiN
