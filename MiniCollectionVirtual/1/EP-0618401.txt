<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire has a housing (1) in which unround openings (10, 11) are 
present through which arc-shaped support arms (20) of unround cross-section project. 

The support arms (20) have teeth (21) which cooperate with boundaries of the openings 
(10, 11). When a luminaire has been built in, the support arms (20) rest on the ceiling. 

Their teeth (21) and the boundaries of the openings (10, 11) fix these arms in their 
support positions. The luminaire may be of modular construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a luminaire for recessed mounting in a false 
ceiling, comprising:
 
   a housing with a base wall and opposite thereto a window for the emission 
of light;
 
   mutually interconnected side walls joined to the base wall;
 
   support arms movably connected to the housing and suitable for 
supporting the luminaire on a false ceiling in a support position of these arms;
 
   which luminaire is provided with means for fixing the support arms in 
their support positions. Such a luminaire is known from EP 0 140 058 B1. The support arms in the known luminaire are fastened to the outside of 
the housing with hinging possibility. They are profiled or bent so that they have a 
support surface of complicated shape at a side thereof. The object of this is to reduce 
horizontal forces on the false ceiling in all those cases in which the hinging points of the 
support arms are at a lower level than their support points on the ceiling. The fastening 
spot of the support arm which is in a comparatively low position relative to the ceiling 
is necessary because of the nature and construction of the fixation means. The fixation means of the known luminaire comprise for each support arm 
an arc-shaped fixation arm which projects through a opening in the housing to the 
exterior and which is hinged to the relevant support arm. The arc-shaped fixation arm 
has a sawtooth profile at its exterior, which profile cooperates with the boundary of the 
opening in the housing. The hinging connection between the support arm and the 
fixation arm accommodates a spring element which strives to increase the angle 
enclosed by the support arm and the fixation arm, and thus to keep the sawtooth profile 
in engagement with the boundary of the opening. The support arms are of a complicated shape. False ceiling constructions  
 
must be known in order to give the arms the correct profiles in the correct locations. 
The support arms and their fixation means always require the manufacture and assembly 
of at least three components, the provision of openings in the housing, and a 
complicated mounting operation in and at the housing. Another luminaire for recessed mounting in a false ceiling is known from 
EP 0 268 283 A2. Here, again, support arms are hinged to the housing. They can be 
pressed towards the ceiling in downward direction by means of a screw which is 
tightened. Disadvantages of this luminaire are inter alia the complicated suspension 
means for the support arms, the necessity of using tools for

<CLAIMS>
A luminaire for recessed mounting in a false ceiling, comprising: 
   a housing (1) with a base wall (2) and opposite thereto a window (3) for 

the emission of light; 
   mutually interconnected side walls (4, 5) joined to the base wall; 

   support arms (20) movably connected to the housing and suitable for 
supporting the luminaire on a false ceiling in a support position of these arms; 

   which luminaire is provided with means for fixing the support arms in 
their support positions, 

   characterized in that the support arms (20) are each arc-shaped, concave 
as seen from the window (3), and have a unround cross-section, and in that the means 

for fixing the support arms (20) in their support positions comprise unround openings 
(10, 11) in the housing through which respective support arms (20) project to the 

exterior and teeth (21) at the support arms which can cooperate with a boundary (10', 
11') of the relevant unround opening (10, 11), which boundary extends along the 

window (3). 
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the housing is 
double-walled (50, 51) at least at the areas of the openings. 
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the openings (10, 
11) are dimensioned with clearance in a direction transverse to the window (3). 
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the teeth 
(21) are present at the concave side of the support arms. 
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that support arms 
have a wider clearance in the opening (10) in the outer wall (50) than in the opening 

(11) in the inner wall (51). 
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the support 
arms (20) have ridges (22) extending substantially parallel to the window (3) at an end 

face outside the housing (1). 
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 6, characterized in that the 
 

support arms (20) each have a widened portion (23) at a end face situated inside the 
housing (1). 
A luminaire as claimed in ay one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the housing (1) is built up from modules (2, 4, 5).
