Process for the production of a two-coat finish 
on a substrate surface, in which 


(1) a pigmented aqueous basecoat containing a water-dilutable 
emulsion polymer as binder is applied to 

the substrate surface, 
(2) a polymer film is formed from the basecoat applied 
in stage (1), 
(3) a transparent topcoat is applied to the basecoat 
thus obtained, and then 
(4) basecoat and topcoat are baked together, 
 
characterized in that the emulsion polymer contained in 

the basecoat can be obtained by subjecting a mixture of 

(a) 45 to 99% by weight of a cycloaliphatic or 
aliphatic ester of methacrylic acid or acrylic 

acid which is free from hydroxyl, carboxyl and 
sulphonic acid groups, or of a mixture of such 

esters, 
(b) 1 to 20% by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated 
monomer which carries at least one hydroxyl group 

per molecule, or of a mixture of such monomers, 
(c) 0 to 10% by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated 
monomer which carries at least one carboxyl or at 

least one sulphonic acid group per molecule, or of 
a mixture of such monomers, and 
(d) 0 to 25% by weight of a further ethylenically 
unsaturated monomer which is different from (a), 

(b) and (c), or of a mixture of such monomers, 
 
the sum of the proportions by weight of (a), (b), (c) 

and (d) always being 100% by weight, to free-radical 
polymerization in the aqueous phase in the presence of 

a reaction product (A) and of one or more emulsifiers, 
the reaction product (A) being obtainable by reacting 


(i) a butadiene homo- or copolymer, 
(ii) at least one fatty acid of a drying oil and/or 
at least one drying oil, and 
(iii) maleic anhydride 
  
 

in a mass ratio of (i):(ii):(iii) = 1.0:0.1 to 0.6:0.1 
to 0.6 and, after adding a basic aqueous solution, 

converting the reaction product to an aqueous 
dispersion. 
Aqueous paints containing an emulsion polymer 
as binder, characterized in that the emulsion polymer 

is obtainable by subjecting a mixture of 

(a) 45 to 99% by weight of a cycloaliphatic or 
aliphatic ester of methacrylic acid or acrylic 

acid which is free from hydroxyl, carboxyl and 
sulphonic acid groups, or of a mixture of such 

esters, 
(b) 1 to 20% by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated 
monomer which carries at least one hydroxyl group 

per molecule, or of a mixture of such monomers, 
(c) 0 to 10% by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated 
monomer which carries at least one carboxyl or at 

least one sulphonic acid group per molecule, or of 
a mixture of such monomers, and 
(d) 0 to 25% by weight of a further ethylenically 
unsaturated monomer which is different from (a), 

(b) and (c), or of a mixture of such monomers, 
 
the sum of the proportions by weight of (a), (b), (c) 

and (d) always being 100% by weight, to free-radical 
polymerization in the aqueous phase in the presence of 

a reaction product (A) and of one or more emulsifiers, 
the reaction product (A) being obtainable by reacting 


(i) a butadiene homo- or copolymer, 
(ii) at least one fatty acid of a drying oil and/or 
at least one drying oil, and 
(iii) maleic anhydride 
 
in a mass ratio of (i):(ii):(iii) = 1.0:0.1 to 0.6:0.1 

to 0.6 and, after adding a basic aqueous solution,
