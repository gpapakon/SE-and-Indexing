<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump which sucks 
and discharges fluid, and is preferably applied particularly 
to a pump for handling fluid with high kinematic viscosity, 
for example various types of pumps which are mounted on 
vehicles, particularly a pump used for a hydraulic pump in an 
anti-lock brake device or traction control device. As shown in FIG. 20, a piston pump 1405 having a 
structure provided with an intake check valve in which a ball 
needle 1401 is applied pressure with a spring 1403 is known as 
a conventional hydraulic pump in an anti-lock brake device for 
a vehicle. In this piston pump 1405, because the spring force 
of the spring 1403 acts upon the ball needle 1401, the intake 
resistance of the intake check valve is high, and the intake 
was difficult when the kinematic viscosity of the brake oil 
increased, for example when at low temperature. In this manner, the conventional piston pump 1405 
have the problem with a deterioration of volumetric efficiency 
in case that the kinematic viscosity of the fluid is high. That is to say, as shown in FIG. 21, the possible  
 
intake volume QA of the conventional piston pump 1405 
increases in the suction stroke from top dead center to bottom 
dead center of the piston, and decreases and discharge stroke 
from bottom dead center to top dead center. In case that the kinematic viscosity of the brake 
oil is low, because the fluid flows into the pump chamber 1409 
while substantially following the increase in the possible 
intake volume QA in the above suction stroke, the intake 
quantity of the piston pump 1405 becomes sufficient and no 
discharge insufficiency occurs. However, if the kinematic 
viscosity of the brake oil becomes high, for example, low 
temperature or the like, the inflow speed of the brake oil 
(fluid) to the pump chamber 1409 declines, and so the inflow 
quantity QB does not follow the increase in the possible 
intake volume QA and an inflow delay occurs. Because the 
possible intake volume QA declines when the piston passes 
bottom dead center, as described the above, the final inflow 
quantity QC of fluid per cycle of the piston to the pump 
chamber may fall greatly below the maximum value Q0 
(corresponding to bottom dead center) of the possible intake 
volume QA. FIG. 21 shows the inflow quantity QB of the fluid in 
case that the inflow speed is Q0 / (t4 - t0) [cm3/sec.], and 
the final inflow quantity QC [cm3] is only approximately 69% 
of the maximum value Q0 [cm3]. In other words, the volumetric 
efficiency of
