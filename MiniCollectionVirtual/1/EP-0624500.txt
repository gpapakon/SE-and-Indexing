<ABSTRACT>
An inspection and/or repair vehicle with enclosed cabs (V, H) which are arranged at the front and at the rear on a driveable chassis (G) and each have an operator stand (S, B) and a lockable third cab (M) which is located between the two cabs (V, H) is proposed, the bodywork (K) of which cabs can be opened laterally and upwardly completely and contains at least one extendable working platform (A) from which the vehicle can also be controlled, the front and/or rear cab (V, H) being constructed as a workshop space with at least one testing device for running gear devices. The bodywork (k) of the central cab (M) can consist optionally of fold-out and/or pivot-out elements and roller-like or segmental door-like sub-elements. These elements can be inserted or stowed away into intermediate spaces of the vehicle provided for this purpose while the working platform (A) is in use. The vehicle can be controlled absolutely from the working platform (A), i.e. both the drive of the vehicle and the drive of the working platforms (A) can be controlled.

<CLAIMS>
Vehicle for inspection and repair with two enclosed cabins (V, H) located at the front 
and rear of a chassis (G) able to be power driven, each with a control stand (S, B) and, 

located between the other two cabins, a third cabin (M) able to be closed off and the 
encasing housing (U) of which can be opened completely to the side and the top, and 

comprising at least one extendable working platform (A) from which the vehicle can 
also be controlled, and on which the front and/or rear cabin (V, H) is designed as a 

workshop with at least one testing facility for track installations. 
Vehicle according to Claim 1 characterized by the fact that the third cabin (M) has a 
divisible encasing housing (U) of which at least some sub-elements (T, D, R 1, R 2) are 

coupled with other parts of the vehicle. 
Vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2 characterized by the fact that the encasing housing 
(U) of the third cabin (M) consists essentially of hinged and/or swivelling elements (T, 

D) which are connected at least in part to the working platform (A) and/or the adjacent 
cabins (V, H). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 or 2 characterized by the fact that the 
encasing housing of the third cabin (M) consists essentially of two roller shutters (R 1, R 

2) which can be closed from the chassis (G) towards the centre (18) of the roof of the 
cabin (M). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 4 characterized by the fact that the sub-elements 
(R 1, R 2, T, D) of the encasing housing of the opened third cabin (M) can be 

inserted into a space beside or below the working platform (A).  
 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 5 characterized by the fact that at least 
parts (D 1, D 4) of the roof of the third cabin (M) can be tilted onto the adjacent roof of 

the other cabins (V, H) and a lamp (L) and/or a camera (K) is mounted on the underside 
of these parts. 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 6 characterized by the fact that the working 
platform (A) is designed as a scissors-type lifting platform where the scissors arrangement 

is composed of individual lever arms (E) coupled in pivots (I, J) and two lever 
arms each can be spread eccentrically by a fluid cylinder (Z). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 7 characterized by the fact that the working 
platform (A) has a platform (X) able to be swivelled by +/- 180Â° and supported on 

bearings eccentrically on a frame (R) of the scissors and which can also be extended to 
the side of the frame (R). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 8 characterized by the fact that the working 
platform (A) is designed to be able to be moved transversely to the longitudinal axis of 

the vehicle on a telescopic element (Q). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 9 characterized by the fact that the working 
platform (A) has power connections for tools (4). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 10 characterized by the fact that the front 
and rear cabin (V, H) are identical in dimension and formation to the encasing housing 

(U) and each have windows (F) at the back.  
 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 11 characterized by the fact that it is 
designed as an inspection vehicle for overhead lines (O) and the testing facility has at 

least one testing workstation (5 to 8) in one cabin (V, H) and a measuring pantograph 
(N) on one cabin. 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 12 characterized by the fact that sealing 
sections are located between the cabins (V, M, H). 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 13 characterized by the fact that at least 
parts of the cabins (V, H, M) have a recess (11) in the longitudinal direction of the 

vehicle to the chassis (G) for stowing poles and similar long objects. 
Vehicle according to one of the Claims 1 to 14 characterized by the fact that at least 
one cabin is designed as an installation able to be closed off with movable roller-shutter-type 

wall elements (R 1, R 2) which run in guide-rails constituting frames for the 
adjacent sidewalls and which can be closed upwards by means of a winding device 

(21) located at the bottom of the installation. 
Vehicle according to Claim 15 characterized by the fact that the roller-shutter-type wall 
elements (R 1, R 2) can be closed in opposite directions with two wall elements of a 

width corresponding to the width of the cabin designed at the same time as a roller 
shutter closing off a third side of the cabin where the guide-rail of at least one wall element 

extends to the third side.
