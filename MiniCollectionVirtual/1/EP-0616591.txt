<ABSTRACT>
An inner receptacle (20) having a single integral piece flexible bag (22) including a thin walled portion (24) and a rigid fitment portion (26). The fitment portion (26) includes a flange (42) which is larger in diameter than the flexible bag (22) to provide a mechanism to attach the inner receptacle (20) to a bottle. The fitment portion (26) also provides a finger grasping portion. The inner receptacle (20) may be utilized in, for example, a squeeze pump package, a trigger or finger pump package, or a mechanical pump package. The inner receptacle (20) also includes a mechanism (36) for enabling substantially all of the product therein to be dispensed. One such mechanism is provided by a perforated diptube (36). Another such mechanism is provided by the combination of a resiliently deformable upper half and a collapsible lower half to cause the flexible bag to invert upon itself. These single integral piece flexible bags are preferably made by a modified press-blowing process wherein an increased range of motion is provided by a rack and pinion mechanism to enable formation of the large flange.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PACKAGE WITH REPLACEABLE INNER RECEPTACLE HAVING LARGE INTEGRALLY MOLDED FITMENTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe resent invention relates to dispensing packages which incorporate an inner receptacle including a flexible fluid product-containing bag; and more particularly, to such packages wherein the inner receptacles are replaceable.2. Description of the Prior ArtSeveral types of dispensing packages are known which include an inner receptacle. Such packages are commonly referred to as bag-in-bottle packages. Bag-in-bottle packages have incorporated various dispensing mechanisms, including squeeze-pump packages such as disclosed in United States Patent 4,842,165 issued to Van Coney on June 27, 1989; and trigger sprayer packages such as disclosed in United States Patent 5,004,123 issued to Stoody on April 2, 1991.In addition, some prior bag-in-bottle packages have acknowledged the benefits of enabling reuse of the outer package by enabling replacement, of an empty inner receptacle with a new, full inner receptacle. Thus, the bulk of the package becomes reusable which reduces packaging costs to the manufacturer and to the environment. For example, United States Patent. 5,004,123 issued to Stoody on April 2, 1991 discloses such a replaceable inner receptacle for use with a trigger sprayer or finger pump bag-in-bottle package. The disclosed inner receptacle, however, is made of multiple separate and distinct components which must be attached together in a sealed manner. In particular, the body of the flexible bag (which is made of a tubular flexible material) must be sealed to a rigid fitment in an air tight 

 manner around the entire curved circumferential surface of the fitment.United States Patent 2,608,320, issued to Harrison on August 26, 1952, discloses another bag-in-bottle package which has a replaceable inner receptacle. This package operates as a squeeze pump. Like Stoody, the inner receptacle of Harrison is made of" multiple separate and distinGt components. In particular, a thinner, flexible, lower bag portion is' sealed in an air tight manner to an upper, thicker, rigid, bag portion around the entire curved circumferential surface of the bag.- One disadvantage with these and similar inner receptacles is the requirement of sealing at the connection of . the individual parts; particularly between curved surfaces. Such connections, whether welded, clamped, glued, etc., will generally lack the strength and/or air-tight integrity of a similar receptacle having a one-piece

<CLAIMS>
 WHAT WE CLAIM IS :
1. A replaceable inner receptacle for use in an outer bottle having a large finish comprising:
(a) a single integral piece flexible bag adapted to contain a fluid product and including:
I. a thin walled portion having a thickness small enough that the walled portion readily collapses; and
II. a relatively thick fitment portion, having a fluid passage therethrough providing fluid communication with the interior of the flexible bag, and including a flange having an overall dimension greater than the dimension of the thin walled portion of the flexible bag, and the periphery of the flange being adapted to attach to the large finish of the outer bottle; and
(b) means for enabling substantially all of the fluid product within the flexible bag to be dispensed.
2. A replaceable inner receptacle for use in an outer bottle comprising;
(a) a single integral
"
 piece flexible bag adapted to contain a fluid product and including:
I. a thin walled portion having a thickness small enough that the thin walled portion readily collapses; and
II. a relatively thick fitment portion having a fluid passage therethrough providing fluid communication with the interior of the flexible bag, and including a flange and a grasping portion which extends above the flange to provide means for grasping and removing the inner receptacle from the bottle; and
(b) means for enabling substantially all of the fluid product within the flexible bag to be dispensed. 


 3. A replaceable inner receptacle according to Claim 1, wherein the fitment portion includes a grasping portion which extends above the flange.
4. A replaceable inner receptacle according to Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein the grasping portion is a cyclindrical neck portion which surrounds the fluid passage.
5. A replaceable inner receptacle according to any one of the above Claims, wherein the means for enabling substantially all of the product within the flexible bag to be dispensed is a perforated diptube substantially preventing said bag choking off fluid flow from said bottom of said bag when said bag is exposed to external pressure.
6. A replaceable inner receptacle according to any one of the above Claims, wherein the means for enabling substantially all of the product to be dispensed is the combination of the thin walled portion corresponding to the lower half of the inner receptacle and a relatively thick upper half of the flexible bag which maintains the upper half in its substantially original shape, such that the lower half inverts inside the upper half of the flexible bag.
7. A replaceable inner receptacle according to Claim 6, wherein the upper half of the flexible bag includes corrugations.
8. A replaceable inner receptacle according to any one of the above Claims, wherein the means for enabling substantially all of the product to be dispensed is the combination of the thin walled portion corresponding to the lower half of the inner receptacle and the upper half of the flexible bag being resiliently deformable such that after being radially deflected under an externally supplied squeeze force the upper half of the flexible bag returns to its substantially original shape. 


 9. A replaceable inner receptacle according to any one of the above Claims, wherein the bottle includes a closure having a dispensing orifice, and wherein the flange is adapted to act as a spring when placed in the bottle and the closure is tightened, such that a compression seal is provided to provide substantially fluid tight communication between the fluid passage and the dispensing orifice.
10. A replaceable inner receptacle according to any one of the above Claims, further comprising a peelable tear tab applied to said hollow rigid fitment portion for sealing the fluid passage of the fitment portion, the peelable tear tab being manually removable from said fitment portion.
