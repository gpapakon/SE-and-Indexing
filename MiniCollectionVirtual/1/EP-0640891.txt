<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed generally to hologram 
structures, and more particularly to an encoded 
hologram for laminated identification cards and the like 
which contains human viewable information as well as 
machine readable indicia that is substantially incapable of 
being resolved by human vision. Laminated identification cards such as those containing 
a photograph of the authorized card holder are widely 
used for security purposes. Laminated identification cards 
commonly include other human readable information as well 
as machine readable information contained on a magnetic 
strip for example. An important consideration with laminated identification 
cards is counterfeiting and/or tampering. One approach 
to preventing counterfeiting and/or tampering is to 
incorporate human or machine readable holograms that are 
difficult to remove into laminated identification cards so 
that tampering would result in damage to the hologram which 
would be rendered unreadable. Counterfeiting is prevented 
by utilizing a hologram whose construction is difficult to 
ascertain, whose presence is difficult to ascertain, or 
which is difficult to copy. However, the provision of both 
human readable and machine readable holograms in accordance 
with known techniques requires two or more holograms.  It would therefore be an advantage to provide a 
hologram structure that contains in a single hologram both 
human readable information and machine readable information. Another advantage would be to provide a hologram 
structure that contains in a single hologram both human 
readable information and machine readable information that 
is substantially incapable of being resolved by human 
vision. A further advantage would be to provide a hologram 
structure that contains in a single hologram human readable 
information and machine readable information which is 
masked by the presence of the human readable information. The foregoing and other advantages are provided by the 
invention in an encoded hologram that produces a first 
image and a second image pursuant to playback illumination, 
wherein the first image is resolvable by human vision while 
the second image is not resolvable by human vision when the 
playback illumination does not emulate the original reference 
beam utilized for construction as defined by the well-known 
grating equation, and wherein the second image is 
machine readable when the hologram is illuminated with 
playback illumination that emulates the original reference 
beam as defined by
