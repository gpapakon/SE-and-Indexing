<ABSTRACT>
The annual calendar mechanism includes a calendar-entraining wheel (18) fitted with a finger (17) capable of entraining a calendar wheel (19) one notch at the end of each month. An annual wheel (25), entrained two notches once a month by a long tooth (23) carried by an intermediate wheel (21) itself enmeshing with the calendar wheel (19), includes a plate (27) carrying five teeth (28). If one of these five teeth, corresponding to one of the months with fewer than thirty-one days, shows up in the path of the finger (17), the annual wheel (25), from being driven becomes driving and entrains, via the intermediate wheel, the calendar wheel an extra notch.

Annual calendar mechanism for a timepiece, such 
calendar displaying through a window (60) pierced in a dial 

(15) or by division marks (63, 64) applied to the dial to 
which a hand (16, 62) points, such mechanism including a date 

driver wheel set (18) making one revolution in twenty-four 
hours, said wheel set being fitted with at least one first 

finger (17) adapted to drive a date wheel (19) including 
thirty-one teeth (20) through one step once each day, said 

wheel operating the calendar display, characterized by the 
fact that the date wheel (19) drives an intermediate wheel 

(21) including thirty-one teeth, thirty (22) of which are 
truncated, the non-truncated tooth (23) driving a first plate 

(24) of an annual wheel (25) bearing twenty-four teeth (26) 
once per month through two steps, such annual wheel comprising 

a second plate (27) fixed thereto and superposed thereon 
bearing five teeth (28), each corresponding to months of less 

than thirty-one days, each of such teeth being arranged so as 
to come into the path of the first finger (17) or of a second 

finger (41) of the date driver wheel set (18) at the end of 
the cited months so as to drive the annual wheel (25) through 

one step, which has as consequence the driving of the date 
wheel (19) through an additional step via said intermediate 

wheel (21) at the end of said months. 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that a jumper spring (30) is arranged over the teeth (26) 

of the first plate (24) of the annual wheel (25) so as to 
position it angularly when it is not actuated. 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that a jumper spring (31) is arranged over the teeth (20) 

of the date wheel (19) so as to position it angularly when it 
is not actuated.  

 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the five teeth (28) of the second plate (27) of the 

annual wheel (25) are arranged around said second plate 
successively at 60°, 60°, 90°, 60° and 90°. 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that it includes a months display (32) comprising a star 

(33) with twelve teeth indexed by a jumper spring (35), the 
star being actuated once per month by a finger (36) fixed to 

the intermediate wheel (21). 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that it includes a day display (37) comprising a star 

(38) with seven teeth (39) indexed by a jumper spring (40), 
the star being actuated once per day by the finger (17) borne 

by the date driver wheel set (18). 
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that it includes a rapid corrector (42) in engagement 

with the date wheel (19), said corrector being actuated by the 
crown (61) exhibited by the timepiece.
