<DESCRIPTION>
INHIBITORS OF TΕSTOSTERONE 5α-REDUCTASE ACπVITYField of the InventionThis invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and methods for the treatment of androgen-related diseases, said compositions having novel inhibitors of testosterone 5α-reductase activity. The inhibitors have a good combination of inhibitory effect on 5α-reductase activity, low or no androgenic activity and, in some embodiments, antiandrogenic activity. More particularly, certain embodiments of the invention relate to derivatives of 4-aza-androstanone or 4-aza-androstenone.Background of the InventionPrior art inhibitors of 5α-reductase fail to provide an optimal combination of (1) lack of inherent androgenic activity and (2) ability to inhibit both of two different forms of testosterone 5α-reductase ("5α-reductase"). 5α-reductase is an enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of the androgen, testosterone, to the much more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone ("DHT'). DHT is the more active androgen in many target organs (Anderson and Liao. Nature 219:277-279, 1968). The same enzyme catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione into androstanedione. Inhibitors of 5α-reductύse inhibit biosynthesis of the products whose formation is catalyzed by 5α-reductase.5α-reductase has been studied in different species (Liang et al. Endocrinology 117: 571-579, 1985). Its isolation and structure, and theSUBSTJTUTE SHEET 

expression of cDNA encoding it have been described (Andersson and Russell. Proc Natl. Acad. Sri. 87:3640-3644, 1990).Recent data have demonstrated the presence of at least two different genes expressing 5α-reductase in humans. Type 15α-reductase (Andersson and Russell, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sά. 87, 3640-3644, 1990) is expressed at a low level in the human prostate while type II 5α-reductase is the predominant enzyme isoform expressed in this tissue (Andersson et al., Nature 354, 159-161, 1991).The blockade of 5α-reductase has been intensively studied in view o developing pharmaceutical drugs for the therapy of dise ses, such as prostate cancer. In European Patent Appln. No. EP 285383 Ramusson et al. disclose the treatment of prostatic carcinoma with 17β-N-monosubstituted-carbamoyl- 4-aza-5cx-androst-l-en-3-ones). Diseases for which 5α-reductase inhibitors are also being studied include acne, baldness (Rittmaster et al. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.65: 188-193, 1987) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (Metcalf et l., TiPS10: 91-495, 1989).The 4-aza-steroid N,N-diethyl-4-methyl-3-oxo-4-aza-5α androstane-17β-carboxamide, 4-MA has proven
