<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an electrically heated plug (10) for igniting fuel-air mixtures. This plug (10) surrounds a tubular electric insulator (12) sealed in the through drilling (11/3) of its tubular metal casing (11) in the longitudinal drilling (12/6) of which is secured a central electrode (16) which is electrically connected to a connector (19); the electric insulator (12) is fitted with a collar (12/2) to provide a gastight seal in the metal casing (11). The heating element (21) is fitted on a cylindrical longitudinal section (12/3) of the insulator (12) on the combustion chamber side as a thick film of predetermined configuration, in which the conductors (22) to the heating element (21) are also taken. In the preferred embodiment, the insulator (12) consists of two components, the first containing the longitudinal drilling (12/6) and having over its entire length the same diameter as the longitudinal section (12/3) bearing the heating element (21) and the second having a sleeve shape forming the collar (12/2) and being pushed over and secured to the first.
