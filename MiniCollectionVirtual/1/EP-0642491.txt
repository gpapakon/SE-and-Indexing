<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) from crude terephthalic acid (CTA) comprising mixing the CTA with an aqueous medium to form an aqueous CTA mixture, heating the mixture to dissolve substantially all of the CTA in the aqueous medium by introducing into the aqueous mixture vapour having a temperature greater than that of said mixture and then chemically reducing impurities in the aqueous solution of CTA followed by recovery of PTA by a crystallisation process. The vapour is typically steam derived from the crystallisation process and may be introduced into the aqueous CTA mixture by means of an injection device (30) (Figures 2 and 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of purified
terephthalic acid.Purified terephthalic acid (PTA) may be obtained by purification
of crude terephthalic acid (CTA) which is conventionally produced by
the oxidation of p-xylene in the presence of oxygen and a catalyst in a
liquid phase comprising for example acetic acid. CTA typically contains
impurities for example catalyst residues and by-products of the
oxidation of p-xylene such as benzoic acid, p-toluic acid, trimellitic
acid and especially 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA). CTA may also be
produced by the hydrolysis of polyalkylene terephthalate for example,
polyethylene terephthalate.The purification process conventionally involves mixing the CTA
with an aqueous medium which, at low temperatures, provides a slurry of
CTA. The slurry of CTA is heated to dissolve the terephthalic acid in
the aqueous medium to provide an aqueous terephthalic acid solution
which may contain organic impurities for example 4-CBA. This aqueous
solution is then contacted at elevated pressure and temperature with
hydrogen, preferably in the presence of a catalyst, under reducing
conditions to reduce chemically at least a proportion of the
impurities. Following hydrogen treatment, the terephthalic solution is
subjected to a crystallisation process in which the pressure and
temperature of the solution is decreased, resulting in the formation of
PTA crystals which are then recovered. As disclosed in for example US
Patents Nos. 4500732 and 4405809, conventional practice is to pass water evaporated
in the crystallisation process to a recycle solvent drum. It is also
known from US Patent No. 3584039 to condense evaporated water produced
in the crystallisation process and recycle the condensate for
dissolution of CTA.Energy is required in order to heat the slurry of CTA in aqueous
medium to at least a temperature at which the terephthalic acid
dissolves in the said medium. Hitherto this energy has been derived at
least in part by indirect heat transfer from a material such as steam
or water derived from another stage of the terephthalic acid production
process by using a series of conventional shell and tube heat
exchangers. Provision of such heat exchangers in a terephthalic acid
production process incurs significant capital expense. Furthermore, 
heat is transferred across a surface and inevitably heat loss is
encountered in such heat exchangers.There are further problems associated with using such heat
exchangers in a terephthalic acid production process. They

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) from crude
terephthalic acid (CTA) which contains at least one organic impurity comprising

mixing the CTA with an aqueous medium to form an aqueous CTA mixture, heating
the mixture to dissolve substantially all of the CTA in the aqueous medium and

thereby produce a solution of CTA, hydrogenating the aqueous CTA solution to
reduce chemically at least some of the said organic impurity and to form an aqueous

stream of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), and decreasing the pressure and
temperature of the aqueous PTA stream to effect crystallisation of PTA, said heating

of the mixture of CTA with aqueous medium being effected at least in part by
introducing into the mixture steam having a temperature greater than that of said

aqueous mixture, the steam being derived
from the crystallisation section,

characterised in that the steam so derived contains paratoluic acid and is introduced into said mixture via at least
two steam injection stages each supplied with steam from respective stages of the

crystallisation section in such a way that steam from a higher temperature and
pressure crystallisation stage is supplied to an injection device downstream of an

injection device supplied with steam from a lower temperature and pressure
crystallisation stage, the pressure of the CTA mixture being increased as it passes

from one steam injection stage to the next.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 in which heating of the CTA mixture is
effected by introducing said steam into the mixture and additionally by heat transfer

between the mixture and a heating fluid within a heat exchanger.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 in which the steam is injected into the
aqueous mixture as it flows through a conduit.
A process as claimed in Claim 1 in which the pressure of the flowing stream of
aqueous mixture is locally reduced in each steam injection stage by passage through

the throat of a Venturi section and steam is injected into the aqueous mixture while
the latter is under reduced pressure conditions.
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 in which:

(a) the CTA contains, inter alia, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde and p-toluic acid,
(b) in the production of the aqueous mixture, the CTA is mixed with water of which
at least part is recycled and contains p-toluic acid additional to that present in the

CTA to produce a slurry which is heated to produce an aqueous CTA solution having
an equivalent total p-toluic acid content of at least 3000 ppmw relative to the CTA

content of the solution,
(c) subjecting the aqueous CTA solution to hydrogenation, 
(d) crystallising the hydrogenated solution and terminating the crystallisation
process at an elevated temperature and pressure such that the purified and

crystallised (PTA) contains no more than about 150 ppmw p-toluic acid,
(e) the PTA crystals are subjected to separation and washing processes in which the
PTA crystals are separated from the mother liquor, washed and separated from the

wash liquor to derive a mass of PTA crystals, such separation and washing being
carried out in a zone at elevated temperature and pressure such that the p-toluic

acid content of the separated and washed PTA is maintained at a level no greater
than 150 ppmw relative to the PTA,
(f) at least part of the mother liquor separated from the PTA crystals, together with
at least part of its p-toluic acid content, is recycled to step (b) whereby the recycled

mother liquor constitutes said recycled water used in step (b); and
(g) combining p-toluic acid-containing steam derived from step (d) with said slurry of
step (b) to effect heating thereof in accordance with Claim 1.
