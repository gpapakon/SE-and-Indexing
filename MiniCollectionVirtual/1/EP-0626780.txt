<ABSTRACT>
An image processing apparatus prevents an increase 
in random noise and the like produced by distributing a 

transformation error, which is produced at the time of a 
level-number transformation, to unprocessed pixel data. 

Error data X
n
 is added to pixel data, which has entered 
via an input unit, by means of an adder. Thereafter, 

the resulting data is subjected to a level-number 
transformation by a binarizing circuit. Transformation 

error produced at the time of the level-number 
transformation is calculated by an error arithmetic 

unit. The transformation error thus calculated is 
distributed to unprocessed pixel data by an error-diffusion 

unit, and the error is accumulated in a line 
buffer memory as error data. When processing of a 

prescribed number of lines has ended, a line-number 
discriminating circuit clears the error data that has 

been accumulated in the line buffer memory. As a 
result, an increase in random noise is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processing
method and apparatus for processing image data.In an image processing method known in the art, the
number of gray levels of each color in a color image is
transformed (by a level-number transformation) to two or
a prescribed number while half tones are maintained in a
half-tone image output of an image recording apparatus
or the like. Generally, the error-diffusion method or a
mean-error minimization method, which is substantially
the same as the error-diffusion method, is employed as
the method of transforming the number of gray levels of
image data. These methods, which are applied to various
image processing apparatus as binarizing methods for
preserving half-tone density, execute the level-number
transformation while a difference in density (a
transformation error), with respect to the original
pixel data, that occurs when each pixel is subjected to
the level-number transformation is distributed to as yet
unprocessed pixel data and accumulated.Such an error-diffusion method and apparatus for carrying
the method out are disclosed in European Patent Specification
EP-A-0 333 520 and US Patent Specification US-A-4 680 645.However, in a case where the number of levels of original
image data containing random noise is transformed by the
above-mentioned level-number 
transformation method, the random noise becomes mixed
with the transformation error and is thus distributed to
the still unprocessed pixels, where the noise is
accumulated as a result. Consequently, random noise
increases and invites an marked decline in picture
quality.Accordingly, a concern of the present invention is
to provide an image processing method and apparatus in
which it is possible to prevent an increase in random
noise and the like produced by distributing an error,
which is produced at the time of a gray-level
transformation, to unprocessed pixel data.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided an image processing apparatus as set out
in claim 1. According to a second aspect of the present invention there
is provided an image processing method as set out in claim 7.In the arrangement described above, the
accumulating means (step) accumulates an error, which is
produced at the level-number transformation of pixel
data, as error data for distributing the error to pixel
data not yet processed. The transforming means (step)
executes the level-number transformation based upon the
entered pixel data and the distributed error data. The
error data is updated to a
