<ABSTRACT>
The compression apparatus is intended for creating a bloodless condition in the extremities during surgical interventions or for intravenous local anaesthesia with the aid of a compression cuff that can be applied to the extremities and can be exposed to a pressure medium. A controllable pressure control valve (4) for the pressure medium is used to adjust the compression pressure in the compression cuff. The blood pressure value measured continuously by an automatic blood pressure instrument (12) causes a blood pressure-dependent control signal for the pressure control valve (4) in a control unit (14), so that the compression pressure in the compression cuff changes correspondingly when the blood pressure value changes.

A compression apparatus for producing artificial bloodlessness 
at extremities in surgical operations or for intravenous local 

anaesthesia, comprising a compression cuff which can be applied to the 
extremities and which can be acted upon by a pressure medium, a 

controllable pressure regulating valve (4) for the pressure medium for 
setting the compression pressure in the compression cuff, and an 

automatic blood pressure measuring device (12) and a control signal 
generator which produces a control signal for control of the pressure 

regulating valve (4), which control signal is dependent on the blood 

pressure measurement value which is ascertained continuously or at 
regular time intervals, so that the compression pressure in the 

compression cuff is correspondingly altered upon an alteration in the 
blood pressure measurement value, characterised in that in parallel 

with the pressure regulating valve (4) which is automatically 
controlled by the control signal generator, there is additionally a 

manually settable pressure regulating valve (3) and the compression 
cuff can be switched over between the two pressure regulating valves 

(3, 4) by a two-way valve (16). 
A compression apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in 
that there is provided a pressure sensor (18) for detecting the 

compression pressure, which causes the compression cuff to be switched 
over to the manually controlled pressure regulating valve (3) as soon 

as or as long as the compression pressure measured by the pressure 
sensor (18) (the actual value) differs from the compression pressure 

ascertained from the blood pressure measurement values (the reference 
value), and/or actuates an alarm device. 
A compression apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in  
 

that the comparison of actual value and reference value is effected in 
a computer-aided control device (14) which has a computing means for 

determining the control signal magnitude from the magnitude of the 
blood pressure measurement value, increased by a predeterminable 

additional pressure, and that the control device (14) switches over 
the two-way valve (14) by way of a switching line (20). 
A compression apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in 
that the control device (14) has display devices (21, 30 to 34) for 

the blood pressure measurement value, additional pressure and/or the 
reference value in respect of the compression pressure and data input 

devices (22, 35) for the magnitude of the additional pressure. 
A compression apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that there is provided a manometer (23) for 

displaying the compression pressure (actual value) at the compression 
cuff.
