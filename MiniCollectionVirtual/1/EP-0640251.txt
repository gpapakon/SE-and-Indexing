<ABSTRACT>
A snap-lock battery terminal connector (10) is disclosed. The connector (10) comprises a substantially annular ring (11) which has a lug (22) to which an electrical cable (23) is clamped. The connector (10) further comprises a pivotal member (13) which is manually graspable and which is used to move a clamping member (17) into engagement with one of a plurality of sockets (19) positioned on the exterior surface of the ring (11). The pivotal member (13) when pivoted towards the annular ring (11) with the clamping member engaged in one of the sockets (19) draws the two ends (12 and 20) together for the connector (10) to clamp onto a battery terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A BATTERY TERMINAL CONNECTORThe present invention relates to battery terminals and, in particular, to a snap-lock battery terminal which is easy to remove and install . Battery terminals for motor vehicle batteries and the like usually consist of a pair of half rings which are loose prior to installation. After the half rings have been fitted over the positive or negative terminal of the battery, a screw device is tightened for the terminal clamp to have a tight fit. This tight fit ensures that good electrical contact is made.One disadvantage of this type of terminal clamp arrangement is that the removal and installation of the battery terminal usually requires a screw driver or a spanner. The use of such tools can be time consuming in the case of an electric vehicle such as a fork lift, where a bank of batteries are used to power the vehicle. It is also the case that it is often a requirement to disconnect or remove the battery terminal from the battery when the motor vehicles are being transported, such as by ship. The battery terminal should be disconnected or removed from the battery during such transportation to prevent any possibility that the battery will be dead once the motor vehicle is ready to be driven off the ship at its destination.It is known to provide battery terminal clamps and French Patent No. 78 305 95 (Published under No. 2,440,093); US Patent No. 1,30,772; and US Patent No. 1,943,190 exemplify the prior art. However,- in order to achieve a good clamping action it is necessary for the clamping ring to be relatively flexible and thus reasonably thin so that thick metal sections are not attempted to be deformed. Furthermore, in order to cater for different sizes of terminal posts, an adjustable clamping arrangement is required. Finally, in order to ensure a good electrical connection, the clamping action should surround the substantially cylindrical side wall of the terminal post.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a snap-lock battery terminal which substantially overcomes or ameliorates the above mentioned disadvantages. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a snap-lock battery terminal comprising an annular ring of substantial longitudinal extent and minimal radial thickness which is longitudinally slit to form two ends, a lug protruding outwardly from the ring, said lug being used to attach an electric cable thereto, said annular ring having at one said end a manually graspable

CLAIMS
1. A snap-lock battery terminal comprising an annular ring of substantial longitudinal extent and minimal radial thickness which is longitudinally slit to form two ends, a lug protruding outwardly from the ring, said lug being used to attach an electric cable thereto, said annular ring having at one said end a manually graspable pivotal member pivotaly connected thereto at a first location, said pivotal member having a clamping member pi otally connected thereto at a second location spaced from said first location, said annular ring further having at its other end at least two circu ferentially spaced socket means with either of which said clamping member is able to engage, wherein said pivotal member when pivoted towards said annular ring with said clamping member engaged in one of said socket means simultaneously draws together the two ends of said annular ring and firstly increases, and then slightly decreases, the distance between said first and second locations.
2. A battery terminal according to claim 1, wherein said clamping member is substantially U-shaped having arms extending from opposite sides of said pivotal member, and said socket means engages with the portion of said U-shaped member located between said arms.
3. A battery terminal according to claim 2, wherein said socket means comprises a pair of slots positioned adjacent longitudinally opposite edges of said ring at said other end.
4. A battery terminal according to claim 3, wherein said slots are formed between a pair of lugs which extend outwardly from said ring.
5. A battery terminal accordi g to claim 3, wherein said slots are formed in a radially outwardly bent lug at the other end of said ring.
6. A battery terminal according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said lug which attaches said electrical cable is located at an end of said ring.
7. A battery terminal according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said lug which attaches said electrical cable is located intermediate said ends.
8. A battery terminal according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said ring has at least one tang on its interior surface. 


 _
9. A battery terminal according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said pivotal member is made from plastics.
10. A battery terminal according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said lug which attaches said electrical cable includes two separate pieces which clamp said electrical cable therebetween, and at least one barbed pin is used to secure said two pieces together.
