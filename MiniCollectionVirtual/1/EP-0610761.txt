a magazine hub (1) and includes a plurality of radially extending 

compartment walls (15) to form slide compartments (17), the compartment 
body (11) is designed as a body separate from the hub (1) which is fixedly

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drum-type slide magazine with a compartment 
body which surrounds a hub at least substantially concentrical with the 
axis of rotation of the magazine and has a plurality of compartment walls 
for forming slide compartments and at least one zero compartment, said 
walls extending in radial planes including the axis of rotation and being 
open at their two axial compartment ends to allow passage of the slides 
through the magazine in the axial direction, relative to the axis of rotation, 
the compartment ends being selectively closable and clearable at 
their lower side adapted for engagement with an associated projector by a 
bottom plate which is rotatable relative to said hub and has a cut-out 
slide passage opening. In the case of both such drum-type magazines of the type known from 
DE-PS 1 263 342 and of rectangular slide magazines an important aspect is 
of how the magazine can be adapted to the different types of mounts of 
the slides which are to be accommodated in them. If a magazine is intended 
for slides mounted between glass the compartment body has slide compartments 
with a correspondingly adapted inner compartment width. Such 
a magazine would not be suitable for accommodating unglazed slides mounted 
in thin cardboard frames because a magazine with an inner compartment 
width adapted to thin narrow mounts and the same outer dimensions 
can accommodate a far greater number of slides. Accordingly it has been 
found that a number of different magazines adapted to the different types 
of slides have to be available if slides with different mounts are to be projected. 
While this requirement can be met at relatively low cost when rectangular 
magazines are used considerable costs are caused when drum-type 
magazines are used because they are much more complex and relatively 
expensive to manufacture. It is the object of the invention to provide a drum-type magazine of the 
generic type which is particularly inexpensive to manufacture.  In the case of a drum-type slide magazine of the above-mentioned type 
this object is attained in accordance with the invention in that the compartment 
body is designed as a body which is separate from the hub and 
connected to said hub. The advantage is that if magazines according to the invention having differently 
designed slide compartments are to be manufactured, i.e. drum-type 
magazines with a small number of relative broad compartments for 
glass-mounted slides or with a substantially greater number of narrower 
slide
