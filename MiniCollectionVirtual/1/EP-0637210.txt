<ABSTRACT>
In the method for treatment of potato fruit water the potato fruit water is subjected to a heat treatment to at least 125  DEG C for at least 3 minutes, whereafter the heat treated potato fruit water is cooled to a temperature, at which enzymes are relatively stable, then enzymatically treated with a proteinase, and finally concentrated to microbial stability. Hereby a method for treatment of potato fruit water, which will enable a commercially sound utilization of potato fruit water, is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises a method for treatment of potato fruit water (potato 
waste water). Potato fruit water is a certain fraction which appears during the potato 
starch production. The disintegrated, clean potato chips are first introduced into a 
decanter, the supernatant therefrom being the potato fruit water; the residue is 
introduced into a centrifugal sieve, from which two fractions are taken out, i.e. the 
potato starch fraction and the potato pulp fraction. The annual production of potato 
starch on a global basis is at least around 106 tons, and the corresponding volume 
of potato fruit water is at least around 4 x 106 tons, with a dry matter content of at 
least 105 tons. Before the strict environmental regulations enforced today were passed, 
potato fruit water was simply fed into the sewer system or sprayed onto the fields. 
Another prior art attempt to solve the problem comprising the utilization of potato 
fruit water in an environmentally acceptable and economically sound manner has 
been established by utilization of heat coagulators with subsequent recovery of the 
insoluble part of the protein fraction by centrifugation as a concentrated protein 
precipitate. Also attempts have been made to use ultrafiltration of the potato fruit 
water in some potato processing plants. As around 50% of the total amount of the 
potato protein is low molecular and non-coagulable, the mentioned methods leave 
the non precipitable protein and the low molecular protein components in solution. 
Thus these unwanted products will be present in the waste water which has to be 
treated in waste water treatment plants or utilized by other means. After introduction 
of the enviromental regulations in many countries it became necessary to purify the 
potato fruit water as efficient as possible before it was introduced into the sewer 
system. This was a costly procedure, and the potato starch manufacturer could 
derive no benefit from this expense unless valuable products could be generated. 
It was suggested to concentrate the potato fruit water in order to use it as an animal 
fodder; however, as the potato fruit water without protein separation could not be 
concentrated more than corresponding to about 25% dry matter, due to a sharp 
viscosity rise, and as this percentage was considered too low for practical utilization  
 
of the concentrated potato fruit water as an animal fodder, this suggestion did never 
lead to a commercially sound utilization of potato fruit water. Thus the purpose of the invention
