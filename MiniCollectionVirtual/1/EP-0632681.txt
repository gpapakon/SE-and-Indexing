<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new type of substrate, consisting of at least one insulating coating and of at least one metal coating which is applied flat on at least one surface of the insulating coating and whose thickness is at least 0.2 mm, and which metal coating is weakened in places on at least one edge region by openings which are introduced into the metal coating.

<CLAIMS>
Metal-coated substrate with improved resistance to 
thermal cycling, consisting of at least one insulating 

layer (1, 1') and of at least one metal layer (2,3) 
fixed flat to at least one surface side of the 

insulating layer (1, 1'), whose thickness is at least 
0.2 mm and which displays a weakening in parts in at 

least one edge area (4) through openings (6, 7) made 
in the metal layer, characterised in that the openings 

(6, 7) form two rows along and close to the edge area, 
that the openings (6) of a first row lying closer to 

the edge (4) display a greater depth than the openings 
(7) of a second row lying further from the edge (4), 

that the base of the first openings (6) displays a 
distance from the insulating layer which is less than 

one third of the thickness of the metal layer (2), and 
that the base of the openings (7) of the second row 

display a distance from the surface side of the 
insulating layer (1, 1') which is between one third 

and half of the thickness of the metal layer (2). 
Substrate according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the rows are at a distance from the edge (4) of 10 to 

30 times the thickness of the metal layer (2, 3), 
preferably a maximum of 2 mm. 
Metal-coated substrate with improved resistance to 
thermal cycling, consisting of at least one insulating 

layer (1, 1') and of at least one metal layer (2,3) 
fixed flat to at least one surface side of the 

insulating layer (1, 1'), whose thickness is at least 
0.2 mm and which displays a weakening in parts in at 

least one edge area (4) through openings (6, 7) made 
in the metal layer, characterised in that the openings 

(6, 7) form two rows along the edge area, which are at 
a maximum distance of 2 mm from the edge (4), that the 

openings (6) of a first row lying closer to the edge 
(4) display a greater depth than the openings (7) of  

 
a second row lying further from the edge (4), that the 

base of the first openings (6) displays a distance 
from the insulating layer which is less than one third 

of the thickness of the metal layer (2), and that the 
base of the openings (7) of the second row display a 

distance from the surface side of the insulating layer 
(1,1') which is between one third and half of the 

thickness of the metal layer (2). 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 3, 
characterised in that the openings (6, 7) of both rows 

display the same profile. 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 4, 
characterised in that the openings (6, 7) of both rows 

display different profiles. 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 5, 
characterised in that the openings (6, 7) of both rows 

are staggered. 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 6, 
characterised in that the insulating layer is a 

ceramic layer (1). 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 7, 
characterised in that the insulating layer (1') 

consists of a plastic material, for example of a 
plastic material customarily used for printed circuit 

boards (glass-fibre reinforced printed circuit board 
material). 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 8, 
characterised in that the insulating layer (1') 

consists of a plastic material and is connected flat 
with a further metal backplate (3'). 
Substrate according to one of claims 1 - 9, 
cha
racterised in that the profile of the openings (6,  
 

7) corresponds to approximately 0.5 - 3 times the 
thickness of the at least one metal layer (2).
