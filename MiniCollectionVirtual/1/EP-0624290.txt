The invention relates to a method for cascading two or more feedforward-type sigma-delta modulators, and a modulator system comprising at least two cascaded modulators (1, 2). According to the invention, each subsequent modulator (2) in the cascade quantizes the integrated signal estimate error (e) of the preceding modulator (1), the quantized error (e') is differentiated (3) and subtracted (6) from the quantized output signal (D") of the preceding modulator (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for cascading 
at least two sigma-delta modulators, wherein an error 
of one modulator in the cascade is quantized by the 
next modulator in the cascade; the quantized error is 
differentiated; and the differentiated error is subtracted 
from the quantized output signal of said one 
modulator. In sigma-delta modulators (also known as delta-sigma 
modulators), the signal is quantized by using 
only a small number of quantization levels (2 - 256, 
which corresponds to an A/D converter with a 
resolution of 1 to 8 bits) at a high rate, usually 32 
- 512 times the signal frequency. The ratio between 
the Nyquist sampling frequency (two times the useful 
signal band) and the used high sampling frequency is 
also called oversampling ratio (M). A quantizer is a 
combination of an A/D and a D/A converter, in which 
an analog signal is converted by the A/D converter to 
a discrete digital value which is then immediately 
converted back to an analog voltage (value) by the 
D/A converter. A quantizing error (ek) is the difference 
voltage (value) between the analog input 
voltage and the analog output voltage, and the 
quantizing noise is the spectrum (Qe) of the 
quantizing error; in the case of the sigma-delta 
modulator, the quantizing noise can be regarded as 
white noise. The effective value (E) of the white 
noise in a one-bit quantizer is (q/2)2 with a one-bit, 
where q is the spacing between the quantization  
 
levels. A sigma-delta modulator configuration is such 
that the quantizer error transfer function (NTF) to 
the output of the modulator is different from the 
signal transfer function (STF) from the input to the 
output of the modulator. The object is to provide a 
quantizing error transfer function NTF with the 
highest possible attenuation within a desired passband 
while the signal transfer function STF is as 
uniform as possible over the whole passband. The STF 
and NTF are interdependent in a manner determined by 
the used modulator structure. The order of the modulator 
is the order of the NTF function, or the 
number of integrators in the modulator. By increasing 
the order of the modulator the amount of quantizing 
noise in the passband can be decreased. Another way 
of decreasing the amount of quantizing noise in the 
passband is to increase the oversampling ratio; however, 
an increase in the oversampling ratio increases 
the sampling frequency which in turn is limited by 
the components used in the implementation. Therefore 
the only way to improve the
