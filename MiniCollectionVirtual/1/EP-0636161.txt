<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic polymeric compositions which feature good physical properties which are relatively insensitive to humidity and further exhibit good barrier properties of the compositions comprise: (A) a first conventional polyamide, and (B) an amorphous copolyamide which is polymerized from (B1) a polyamide forming monomer selected from the group consisting of lactams, aminoalkanoic acids and mixture thereof wherein the monomer is present in a molar proportion of between about 0 and 50 %, (B2) a diamine selected from the group consisting of aralkylene diamines, cycloalkylene diamines and mixtures thereof, the diamine being present in a molar proportion of between about 25 and 60 %, (B3) a dicarboxylic acid selected from the group of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, aralkylene dicarboxylic acids, and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids; preferably the use of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid in conjunction with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid is preferred, at least one aromatic diacid, the dicarboxylic acid being present in a molar proportion of between about 25 and 60 %, wherein the (A) and (B) are substantially miscible when formed into a blend composition. The blend composition finds use as a molding composition, as well as a film forming composition, alternatively, may be formed into a variety of articles which exhibit improved physical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic 
polymeric molding compositions; more particularly the 
present invention is related to miscible thermoplastic 
polymeric blend compositions comprising at least one 
polyamide, and at least one amorphous polyamide 
composition wherein the molding composition may be 
characterized as having good gas barrier properties, 
and/or good physical strength characteristics, even 
under conditions of high humidity. As is known, there are exant a multitude of 
moldable thermoplastic compositions which comprise a 
polyamide. Polyamides are desirable engineering 
materials due to their excellent strength 
characteristics including impact strength and wear 
resistance which results from high crystallinity of 
such materials. They are readily processable and 
formable into a variety of articles and shapes, and 
which are readily available. However, polyamides are 
also known to the art to be particularly sensitive to 
moisture absorption, such as might be occasioned during 
use in humid conditions or wherein an article is 
contacted with water, as a consequence of which 
appreciable degradation of many desirable physical 
properties of the polyamide are known to result. 
Further, polyamides are known to exhibit poor vapor  
 
barrier properties to such gases as oxygen, and of 
course, water vapor. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the prior 
art is replete with improved moldable thermoplastic 
compositons which suggest a broad range of additional 
constituents which may be used in conjunction with a 
polyamide in order to achieve selected improvements in 
such compositions. U.S. Patent 4,952,628 to Blatz describes 
thermoplastic blend materials comprising an essentially 
of about 50 - 95 weight percent of an amorphous 
polyamide with about 5 - 50 weight percent of a 
copolymerized ethylene/vinyl alcohol polymer having an 
ethylene content of between 0 - 60%. The blend 
materials taught by Blatz feature physical properties 
which have a reduced sensitivity to humidity, and 
improved barrier properties. The blends taught therein 
provide films and film layers within rigid packaging 
structures which feature good vapor barrier 
characteristics. U.S. Patent 4,983,719 to Fox et al. provides an 
amorphous polyamide composition which is a reaction 
product of a paraxylylene diamine, adipic acid and 
isophthalic acid; the polyamide composition features 
excellent oxygen barrier characteristics and finds 
particular use as a container layer in rigid food 
packaging
