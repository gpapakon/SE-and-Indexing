<ABSTRACT>
A gas producing apparatus is described for producing a 
glass-formating gas required in a flame hydrolysis deposition 

(FHD) method, a VAD method 
or an OVD method. A glass-formating material is supplied 

intact in the form of a liquid to a vaporizer (28), and the 
supply quantity of this liquid material is controlled 

directly by a liquid flow rate control means (26) while the 
material is kept in the form of a liquid. In addition, at 

the same time as the liquid material is vaporized by the 
vaporizer (28), a fixed amount supply means (29) supplies 

an inert gas or a combustion gas at a fixed flow rate to 
the vaporizer (28). Since this prevents a pressure rise in 

the vaporizer (28), the liquid material is stably supplied 
to the vaporizer (28). Therefore, a fixed amount of 

vaporization of the liquid material is constantly performed 
in the vaporizer (28) without being influenced by 

variations in the atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, since 
the vaporized material is supplied to a deposition burner (31) 

together with the inert gas or the combustion gas supplied 
at a fixed flow rate from the fixed amount supply means 

(29), the burner (31) injects a fixed amount of the 
material gas at any instant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas producing
apparatus for producing a glass formation gas required in
a flame hydrolysis deposition (FHD) method, a vapor axial
deposition (VAD) method or an outside vapor deposition
(OVD) method, and a method and an apparatus for
manufacturing an optical waveguide and an optical fiber
preform by using the glass formation gas produced by the
gas producing apparatus.Conventionally, a glass formation gas required in
the manufacture of silica-based optical waveguides is
produced by, e.g., a gas producing apparatus illustrated
in Fig. 1.This gas producing apparatus produces a gas by using
a carrier gas flow rate control method. Referring to Fig.
1, a liquid glass formation material is contained in a
material tank 1 which is heated by a heater 2 surrounding
the material tank 1. A carrier gas 5 controlled at a
predetermined flow rate by a flow rate control unit 4 is
supplied to the material tank 1. A material gas heated at
the temperature of the heater 2 is supplied, together 
with the carrier gas 5, to a condenser 8 through an upper
space 7 of the tank 1 and a pipe 9a. The material gas
supplied to the condenser 8 is cooled to a predetermined
temperature and sent as a saturated vapor gas to a burner
11 through a pipe 9b. The end of the burner 11 extends
through the wall of a reactor vessel 15. The burner 11
injects the material gas supplied through the pipe 9b and
a gas mixture of O2 and H2 supplied as a combustion gas.
The material gas injected from the burner 11 is
hydrolyzed by the flame of the combustion gas to yield
fine glass oxide particles.In the manufacture of optical waveguides, the fine
glass oxide particles injected from the burner 11 are
deposited on the surfaces of substrates 10 placed on a
turntable 12 to oppose the burner 11. These substrates 10
are uniformly heated by lower heaters 14 provided below
the turntable 12. Excess fine glass particles not
deposited on the substrates 10 are exhausted by an
exhaust pipe 13 and treated by an exhaust treatment unit
provided outside the reactor vessel 15 to evacuate the
reactor vessel 15 to the atmospheric pressure or lower.A glass formation gas required in the manufacture of
optical fiber preforms is conventionally produced by,
e.g., a gas producing apparatus shown in Fig. 2.A gas production section of this gas producing
apparatus has an arrangement similar to that shown in 
Fig. 1, so the same reference numerals as in Fig. 1 denote
the same or corresponding parts in Fig. 2, and a detailed
description thereof will be
