<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the production
of hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide rich gases by steam reforming
of hydrocarbons. In particular, the present invention
involves the use of a copper containing nickel reforming catalyst
in the steam reforming of a hydrocarbon feedstock.In the known processes for the production of hydrogen
and/or carbon monoxide rich gases, a mixture of hydrocarbons
and steam and/or carbon dioxide is passed at elevated
temperature and pressure through a reactor packed
with a catalyst, mainly consisting of nickel as the active
catalytic component.Steamreforming catalysts based on nickel and
including copper for improved steam reforming activity are
further known from BE-A-676590 and GB-A-1032754.Hydrocarbon feedstocks suitable for steam reforming
are for instance natural gas, refinery off-gases, propane,
naphtha and liquified petroleum gases. Taking methane as an
example, the reactions, which take place, can be represented
by the following equations:
CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2CO + H2O → CO2 + H2Raw product gas leaving the steam reforming reactor
is conventionally processed by condensation and liquid-gas
phase separation treatment subsequent to the steam reforming.
The liquid process condensate, mainly consisting of
water, is then recycled back to the steam reforming section
via a boiler for steam generation.Prior to introduction into the boiler, the condensate
has in many plants to be subjected removal of water
soluble compounds and salts. For that purpose, the condensate
is passed through a demineralization unit operating
typically on ion-exchange resins. A major problem in the conventional steam reforming
process arises during purification of the process condensate,
especially condensate from steam reforming of a
feedstock with a high content of nitrogen, like natural gas
from certain fields.Nitrogen contained in the feedstock reacts with
hydrogen to ammonia by the reaction:
N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3
   when passing through a bed of nickel steam reforming
catalyst. Ammonia in the raw product gas is almost
quantitatively removed into the process condensate during
processing of the gas. Amounts of ammonia of up to 300
parts per million in the process condensate are not
unusual, when processing raw product gas from the steam
reforming of natural gas.Such high concentrations of ammonia demand frequent
regeneration or renewal of expensive ion-exchange materials
used for demineralisation of the process condensate, which
is inconvenient to the operation of the steam
