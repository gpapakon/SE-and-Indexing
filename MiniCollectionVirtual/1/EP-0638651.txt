<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods and means for the enzymatic determination of aspartame in aqueous solutions. The method is carried out by incubating the sample solution in the presence of, in essence, oxoglutarate, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (GOT), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), NADH and a protease, and measuring the decrease in the NADH extinction by photometry.
