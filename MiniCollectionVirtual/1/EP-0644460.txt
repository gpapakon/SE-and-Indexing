radiation, having high resolving power, high sensitivity, and 

excellent storage stability, and further forming a pattern 
capable of accurately reproducing a mask size in a wide range 

of photomask line width. The present invention has been

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positive working
photoresist composition sensitive to radiation, and more
particularly to a photoresist composition having high resolving
power and high sensitivity, and further forming a fine work
having a good pattern in cross section.The positive working photoresist of the present
invention is coated on a substrate, such as a semiconductor
wafer, a glass plate, a seramic sheet, a metal plate, etc., at
a thickness of from 0.5 to 3 µm by a spin coating method or a
roller coating method. After drying the coated layer by
heating, a circuit pattern, etc., is printed on the layer by
irradiation with ultraviolet rays, etc., through a light
exposure mask, followed by developing to form a positive image.Furthermore, by etching the photoresist layer using the
positive image as a mask, a pattern can be applied onto the
substrate. In the typical application of the positive working
photoresist, there is a semiconductor production step, such as
IC; a production step for circuit substrate of a liquid crystal
and a thermal head; and a photofabrication step.In a positive working photoresist composition, a
composition containing an alkali-soluble resin and a
naphthoquinonediazide compound, as a photosensitive material, 
are generally used. For example, "novolac type phenol
resin/naphthoquinonediazido-substututed compound" is described
in U.S. Patents 3,666,473, 4,115,128 and 4,173,370 as the most
typical composition. Examples of "a novolac resin composed of
cresol-formaldehyde/a trihydroxybenzophenone-1,2-naphthoquinonediazidosulfonic
acid ester" are described in L.F.
Thompson, Introduction to Microlithography, No. 219. pages 112-121,
published by ACS.A novolac resin used as a binder is soluble in an
alkaline aqueous solution without being swollen with solution,
and is particularly useful in the present invention since the
novolac resin gives in particular, highly durable plasma
etching, in the case where the images formed are used as a mask
for etching. Also, when a naphthoquinonediazide compound is
used as a photosensitive material, it functions as a
dissolution inhibitor by lowering the alkali solubility of the
novolac resin by itself. However, it is unique in that when
the naphthoquinonediazide compound is decomposed by irradiation
of light, an alkali soluble material is formed which acts to
increase the alkali solubility of the novolac resin. Owing to
the the large property change due to light, the
naphthoquinonediazide compound is particularly useful as a
photosensitive
