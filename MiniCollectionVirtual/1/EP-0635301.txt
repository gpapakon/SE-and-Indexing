<ABSTRACT>
A carbon-clad inorganic 
oxide particle having an outermost cross
-linked polymer 
coating. Carbon-clad inorganic oxide particles may be 

formed by placing a plurality of the particles in a 
reaction chamber, elevating the temperature within the 

chamber, reducing the pressure within the chamber, and 
introducing into the chamber a vapor comprising carbon and 

thermally decomposing the vapor so as to deposit a 
cladding of carbon onto the particles. The carbon-clad 

particles may be coated with a monomer or an oligomer 
followed by cross-linking the monomer or oligomer to 

provide polymer-coated carbon-clad inorganic oxide 
particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides carbon-clad inorganic oxide 
particles having a polymer coating thereon. The particles 
are useful as a chromatographic support material. The 
invention also provides a method for forming a 
chromatographic support material, by providing carbon-clad 
inorganic particles and then coating the same with a 
monomer or oligomer, and cross-linking the monomer or 
oligomer to form polymer-coated carbon-clad particles. The present invention provides a composite 
support material which is useful as a stationary phase in 
liquid chromatography, particularly in high-performance 
liquid chromatography. The composite support material 
comprises 
carbon-clad inorganic oxide particles which are coated 
with an outermost layer of an organic polymer. The 
particles can be coated by adsorbing a polymerizable 
monomer or oligomer onto the surface of the carbon-clad 
particles, and subsequently cross-linking the monomer or 
oligomer, e.g., by reaction with a free radical initiator 
or by irradiation. Useful inorganic oxides include, but 
are not limited to, the Group II, III and IV metals, i.e., 
HfO₂, ZrO₂, SiO₂, Al₂O₃, TiO₂ and MgO.  
 
solute retention during exposure to increasing amounts of 
alkaline mobile phase. Preferred carbon-clad ZrO₂ spherules useful for 
liquid chromatography applications will comprise a porous 
core ZrO₂ spherule. The core spherules will preferably 
have a diameter of about 1-500 µ, more preferably about 2-50 
µ; a surface area of about 5-300 m²/g, more preferably 
about 15-100 m²/g; and a pore diameter of about 20-5000 Å, 
more preferably about 60-1000 Å. In addition to the core ZrO₂ spherule, the 
support material of the present invention further 
comprises a cladding of carbon. As used herein, the 
phrase "carbon-clad" means that an outer layer, sheath, 
coating, or cladding of pyrolytic carbon is bonded or 
otherwise integrally attached to the underlying ZrO₂ 
matrix. As used herein, "pyrolytic carbon" is intended to 
refer to carbon formed by the carbonization of a suitable 
carbon source, e.g., a hydrocarbon. "Carbonization" means 
that the hydrocarbon or other carbon source is subjected 
to conditions causing it to decompose into atomic carbon 
and other substances. As mentioned above, the ZrO₂ cores of the 
carbon-clad particles are porous. When discussing 
porosity, the term "open pores" refers to interior 
channels in the particles which exit at the surface of the 
particle. The term "closed pores" refers to pores which 
have no exit at the outside
