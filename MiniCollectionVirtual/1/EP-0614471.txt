<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymer blends comprising vinyl 
chloride polymer and heterocyclic thione functional polyurethane polymer. The 
invention also relates to the use of such polymer blends in magnetic recording 
media. Magnetic recording media generally include a binder dispersion 
layer comprising a binder and a pigment overlying a substrate, wherein the 
pigment is dispersed within the binder. Typically, the pigment is a 
magnetizable pigment comprising small, magnetizable particles. In some 
instances, the medium may be in the form of a composite having both back-coat 
and front-coat binder dispersion layers, although the pigment in the back-coat 
may or may not be a magnetizable pigment. It has become desirable to have as high a loading of magnetizable 
pigment in the magnetic recording media as is reasonably possible. It is often 
preferred to have a binder dispersion comprising from 70% to 85% by 
weight magnetizable pigment relative to the binder with as many magnetizable 
particles per unit area or unit volume as possible. It is also preferred to have a 
binder dispersion in which the magnetizable pigment comprises a plurality of 
small particles having a relatively high specific surface area. Higher pigment 
loading has the potential to provide high density magnetic recording media 
capable of storing more information. Problems, however, remain in the art concerning magnetic 
recording media having a relatively high loading of magnetizable pigment. To 
begin with, magnetizable pigments tend to agglomerate, and they are difficult to 
properly and fully disperse within the binder. Wetting agents, or dispersants, 
are often employed to facilitate such dispersion. For higher pigment loading, 
i.e., the use of greater amounts by weight and number of magnetizable 
particles, greater amounts of such dispersants are required, which is not always 
desirable. There are a number of reasons for using as little dispersant as 
possible. Dispersants tend to soften binder systems and decrease their  
 
toughness. They may cure poorly. In addition, dispersants are hydrophilic and 
tend to increase binder water absorbance. Additionally, binder dispersions can 
be more readily and reproducibly prepared when no dispersant is used. 
Further, excess dispersant may have a tendency to bloom from a cured binder 
dispersion over time, leading to contamination of a recording head or the like, 
or causing a change in the physical or chemical characteristics of the media. To help alleviate these problems with high
