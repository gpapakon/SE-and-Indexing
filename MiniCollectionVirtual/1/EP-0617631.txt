<ABSTRACT>
A sustained-released bactericidal cannula (4) or catheter for residence within a portion of a human body through which aqueous biological fluids can pass. The tube has polymeric matrix and antibacterial agent residing within at least a portion of the polymeric matrix. The polymeric matrix includes cured silicon rubber and the antibacterial agent is a finely divided nitrofuran compound. The preferred nitrofuran compound is soluble in water and effective to prevent proliferation of certain bacteria immediately adjacent to the catheter in an otherwise growth supporting aqueous environment when dissolved in the aqueous environment to the limit of its solubility therein at 37  DEG C. The solubility of the nitrofuran compound is preferably about 0.2 % by weight or less at a pH of about 6 and a temperature of about 25  DEG C. At least a finite portion of the polymeric matrix proximate the outer surface includes an amount of from about 10 to about 60 % by weight of the nitrofuran compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sustained
release bactericidal cannulas or catheters which are
either implantable or insertable into a human body.
These devices have an antibacterial agent incorporated
within the device which diffuse out in situ to prevent
the proliferation or colonization of bacteria in regions
adjacent to the exterior of the cannula or catheter.
The present invention also relates to methods for making
the same, products made by these methods, and methods of
using the sustained release bactericidal cannulas or
catheters, to prevent proliferation, colonization or
continued viability of a bacterial population in regions
adjacent to the exterior of the respective cannula or
catheter.Most catheters are a cannula or tube like
device which is inserted into a portion of a person's
body in order to transport fluids or gases in or out of
that particular portion of the body. In passing
through any particular portion of the body in order to
reach its destination, the catheter will come into
contact with various tissues in the body. For example,
a catheter used to drain one's bladder (such as a
"Foley" catheter) must pass through the urethral tract
in order to reach the bladder. A nasogastric catheter
must pass through the nasal passageway and the esophagus
in order to reach the stomach. Some catheters, such as
these, are inserted through existing passageways in
order to reach their destinations, while others are
inserted through surgically created passageways.In virtually every catheterization, there is a
significant potential for microbial growth along the
exterior surface of the catheter which can lead to
serious infections such as urinary tract infections,
bladder infections and the like. Such an infection can 
be encouraged when adjacent tissues are inflamed due to
irritation from rubbing a chafing against this catheter.
This is because inflamed or irritated tissues may be
less apt to respond effectively to suppress local
bacterial infection. In such a situation the infection
can spread and intensify, placing the patient at further
risk. Such infections can lead to sepsis of the bladder
particularly in elderly patients who are incontinent and
have a chronic need for catheterization with an
indwelling self-retaining catheter such as a "Foley"
catheter. Long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters
in nursing home patients is well known as a potential
cause of significant morbidity due to such infections.This problem is widely recognized and many
solutions for this problem have been suggested

A sustained release bactericidal cannula through which aqueous biological
fluids can pass, comprising:


a tube having a surface,

aqueous biological environment,

the polymeric material providing a polymeric matrix,
said matrix containing silicone rubber and said antibacterial agent,
said antibacterial agent can diffuse out of the polymeric matrix and into an aqueous
biological environment when the polymeric matrix comes into contact with such an

aqueous biological environment,
said antibacterial agent is a finely divided nitrofuran compound which is at least
partially soluble in water and effective to prevent proliferation of certain bacteria in

an otherwise, growth supporting, aqueous environment when dissolved in the
aqueous environment to the limit of its solubility therein at 37°C,

at a pH of about 6 and a temperature of about 25°C; and
at least a finite portion of the polymeric matrix includes an amount of from about
10 to about 60% by weight of the nitrofuran compound, and the amount of the

nitrofuran compound in the finite portion of the polymeric matrix and the solubility

diffusion of the anti bacterial agent into the aqueous biological fluids within the 
human body during normal therapeutic use of the cannula within the human body

so long as the aqueous biological fluids are not saturated with the antibacterial
agent, such that the antibacterial agent within the finite portion of the polymeric

matrix can continue to diffuse into the aqueous biological fluids within the human
body in an amount effective to prevent proliferation of certain bacteria immediately

adjacent to the cannula in aqueous biological environments for a period of not less
then about three weeks.
