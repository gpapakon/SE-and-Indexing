<ABSTRACT>
A protection circuit (10) for protecting internal circuitry of 
an integrated circuit (26) from a reverse battery connection has 

been provided. The protection circuit includes a pass transistor 
(14) which is rendered operative when the supply voltage is 

properly connected to the integrated circuit. However, when the 
power supply is improperly connected, a second transistor (32) 

becomes active thereby rendering the pass transistor inactive and 
not allowing the reverse supply voltage to be applied to the 

internal circuitry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to protection circuits and, in
particular but not limited to, a reverse battery protection circuit
for use in automotive applications.There currently exists numerous types of electronic
integrated circuits (IC's) for use in the automotive industry.
Generally, the power supply for these circuits is generated from a
12-volt battery in an automobile. However, automotive IC's tied to
the battery must survive the battery being hooked up backwards,
for example, to avoid forward biasing epitaxial layers of the IC
that are tied to the battery which thereby could result in
destruction of the IC.One attempt that prior art has made for providing reverse
battery protection for IC's is to include a series diode between the
battery and the integrated circuit wherein if the integrated circuit
is connected to the battery backwards, the series diode is reversed
biased and prevents supply voltage from being applied to the
integrated circuit. However, the series diode solution
compromises low voltage performance and the geometry of the
diode becomes larger as supply current requirements increase.Another attempt that prior art has made in providing reverse
battery protection for an integrated circuit is to provide a
saturated lateral PNP transistor in series between the battery and
the integrated circuit. Although low voltage performance is not
compromised in this solution, base current requirements for the
lateral PNP increase power dissipation and the geometry of the PNP
transistor becomes large as supply current requirements increase.Another attempt that prior art has made in providing reverse
battery protection for an integrated circuit is to provide a charged
pumped reverse TMOS transistor as a pass device between the 
battery and the integrated circuit wherein the TMOS transistor has passive
(resistive) gate to source termination. However, this solution requires DC
current from the charge pump to enhance the TMOS transistor, and the turn
off time of the TMOS transistor is limited by the size of the passive gate
termination. Moreover, the charge pump must be high impedance when the
supply voltage is reversed. European patent applications nos. EP-A-0349836
and EP-A-0626745 and German patent application no. DE-A-3930091 give
examples of reverse battery protection circuits. European patent application
no. EP-A-0626745 is however only prior art for this application under Article
54(3) EPC as regards the set of claims for Germany and does
not disclose biasing an epitaxial region containing elements
