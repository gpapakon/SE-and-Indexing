<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel solution phenolics and 
the process for preparing them. In particular, the invention 
relates to viscosity-stable high solids solutions of esters of 
rosin-phenol condensates having properties which make them useful 
in formulating vehicles for gravure printing inks. Hydrocarbon solutions of resin esters of rosin-phenol 
condensates are known in the ink industry as solution phenolics. 
Solution phenolics are commonly employed by ink manufacturers in 
formulating vehicles for gravure printing inks. However, a major 
problem exists with the use of solution phenolics in that they 
tend to increase in viscosity over time. The rate of this 
viscosity growth is concentration-dependent, thereby worsening as 
the level of resin solids contained in a solution increases (see 
Table I below). Compounding this problem is the fact that 
viscosity growth in solution phenolics is also accompanied by 
undesirable variations in dilution values. As these time-dependent 
differences in the physical properties of solution 
phenolics cannot be predicted easily, the resulting variabilities 
create major problems for ink manufacturers. These twin problems of viscosity growth and dilution 
value variation are graphically shown by the data listed in Table 
I below. Here, varying amounts of JONREZ® RP-346 (a rosin-phenolic 
resin manufactured by Westvaco, Inc.) were dissolved in 
toluene to produce solutions having differing resin solid levels.  
 
These solution phenolics were sealed in jars to prevent toluene 
evaporation and held at ambient temperatures (about 25°C) for 2 
weeks. 
Viscosity Growth as a Function of Time and Solids For Untreated Solution Phenolics Percent SolidsPhysical Property Day 1 Day 7 Day 14 Percent Change 45Brookfield Viscosity (mPas)16,80041,00088,530427 Dilution (mL)2972973146 37Brookfield Viscosity (mPas)110019503050177 Dilution1982131980 30Brookfield Viscosity (mPas)19020533677 Dilution1301441408 Table I shows that the rate of viscosity growth was 
proportional to the percent solids of the aged solution: the 
higher the solids level, the greater the increase in viscosity 
over time. For example, at 45% nominal solids a toluene solution 
of JONREZ RP-346 increased 427% (from 16,800 mPas to 88,530 mPas) in 
14 days. At 37.5% nominal solids, a toluene solution of JONREZ 
RP-346 increased 177% in viscosity (from 1100 mPas to 3050 mPas) in 
14 days. At 30% solids, a toluene solution of JONREZ RP-346 only 
increased 77% in viscosity in 14 days.
