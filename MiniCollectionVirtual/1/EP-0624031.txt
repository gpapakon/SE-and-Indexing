<ABSTRACT>
A video display control system, comprising a video display having 
a wide format display ratio and a letterbox processor (100) for 

determining when a picture represented by an input video signal (Y_IN) 
has a letterbox format, the letterbox format picture sometimes having 

auxiliary information disposed in a border area, characterized by a pixel 
counter (108) for generating a running pixel count (H_COUNT); first 

(102) and second (104) comparators, responsive to first and second 
predetermined pixel counts ("68", "218") respectively, and both 

responsive to the running pixel count (H_COUNT); and, a flip/flop (106) 
responsive to each of the comparators (102, 104), for initiating a 

letterbox detection enable signal (LTRBX_EN) when the running pixel 
count (H_COUNT) reaches the first predetermined pixel count ("68") and 

terminating the enable signal when the running pixel count (H_COUNT) 
reaches the second predetermined pixel count ("218'"), the letterbox 

detection enable signal controlling operation of the letterbox processor 
(100) to ignore a certain type of the auxiliary information when present.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of automatic detectors for
letterbox video sources, for example as would be useful in wide
screen televisions.In "letterbox" format, an image in wide format display ratio,
for example 16 X 9 (also designated 16:9), is displayed across the
full width of a narrower format display ratio medium, for example
4 X 3 (also designated 4:3). Movies in a wide format to be
broadcast commercially without distortion or cropping are
converted by the broadcaster to letterbox format, to enable display
on a conventional receiver screen, for example 4 X 3. The
broadcaster effectively adds blank or matte top and bottom borders,
and broadcasts the combined picture and borders in a 4 X 3
composite image signal. Assuming standard 16 X 9 and 4 X 3
ratios, and standard NTSC signals, only 181 horizontal lines in each
field are devoted to the main video, the remaining lines being the
matte, gray or black borders. The useful picture information, or
main video, is generally referred to as active video, whereas the
borders are generally referred to as inactive video, even if the
borders are flat fields having some luminance value and/or
chrominance component. This distinction and designation is
followed herein. The borders may be used, if at all, to display
different types of auxiliary information. A first type is generally
text, such as storm warnings, news alerts and subtitles. A second
type includes station and network logos, which are often graphic or
a combination of text and graphics. Both types of auxiliary
information might be present together, or separately. Both types of
auxiliary information are also generally referred to as active video.When such letterbox displays (in 4 X 3 format) are shown on a
wide screen television, for example 16 X 9 format, the video signal
can be vertically zoomed, that is enlarged, by a factor which both
increases the portion of active video to substantially fill the wide
screen display, and at the same time, substantially eliminates the
upper and lower borders. This can be accomplished without
incurring image aspect ratio distortion. It is a useful feature to
automatically detect letterbox sources and vertically enlarge the 
active portion of the video source signal so as to substantially fill
the display screen.An automatic letterbox detector in a wide screen television is
disclosed in PCT/US91/03739 (WO-A-91/19390). As described
therein, the uppermost and lowermost active video areas are
detected by calculating two gradients for each line in the video
field.

<CLAIMS>
A video display control system, comprising:

a video display means (10) having a wide format display
ratio;
a letterbox detector (100) for determining when a
picture represented by an input video signal (Y_IN)

has a letterbox format in
which an active video portion (14) of said picture is

positioned between upper (16) and lower border areas (18),
said border areas sometimes containing auxiliary information

(24, 52) positioned in different areas of said border areas;
means (LTRBX_BEG, LTRBX_END) responsive to said
letterbox detector for controlling enlargement of said

picture in size to substantially fill said video display
means (10, 30, 60) with said active video portion when said

input video signal is determined to have said letterbox
format;
characterized by
pixel counting means (102, 104, 108) for inhibiting
said letterbox detector (100) from responding to one type of

said auxiliary information (24) by initiating a letterbox
detection enable signal (LTRBX_EN) at a first pixel count

and terminating said letterbox enable signal (LTRBX_EN) at a
second pixel count to restrict operation of said letterbox

detector (100) to a predetermined portion of said border
areas, said predetermined portion being a horizontal range

of each horizontal line of said input video signal wherein
said horizontal range is substantially centered on said line ignoring

horizontal blanking, said predetermined portion being likely
to exclude said one type of auxiliary information.
