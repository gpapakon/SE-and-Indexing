<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor body (2) has first and second major surfaces (2c and 2d) 
with a first region (2b) of one conductivity type adjacent the first major surface (2c). 

An insulated gate field effect transistor (6) is formed within the first region (2c) and 
has source and drain electrodes (S and D) and an insulated gate electrode (G). At 

least one further component (R4) is coupled between the insulated gate electrode 
(G) of the insulated gate field effect transistor (6) and a gate input terminal (GT). 

The further region requires a second region (21) of the opposite conductivity type 
provided within the first region (2b) so that a region (26) of the further component 

(R4), the second region (21) and the first region (2b) form a parasitic bipolar 
transistor (B). An insulating layer (30) on the first major surface (2c) carries a first 

rectifying element (D1) coupled between the base region (8) of the parasitic bipolar 
transistor (B) and the gate input terminal (GT) and a second rectifying element (D2) 

coupled between the emitter region (26) of the parasitic bipolar transistor (B) and 
the gate input terminal (GT) for causing, when the voltage difference between the 

source and insulated gate electrodes (S and G) reverses sign, the first and second 
rectifying elements (D1 and D2) in series with the base and emitter regions of the 

parasitic bipolar transistor (B) to become forward-biassed to reduce the voltage 
between the base and emitter regions of the parasitic bipolar transistor (B) to inhibit 

turn on of the parasitic bipolar transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device, in particular a
semiconductor device comprising an insulated gate field effect transistor integrated
within the same semiconductor body as one or more further components for
controlling or protecting the insulated gate field effect transistor. The insulated gate
field effect transistor may be a vertical power MOSFET of the so-called DMOS type
where the term "vertical" means that the main current in normal operation of the
MOSFET is between opposed first and second major surfacesVarious examples of so-called protected switches or smart power devices
have been proposed in which one or more additional components for controlling or
protecting the insulated gate field effect transistor are integrated within the same
semiconductor body as the insulated gate field effect transistor. For example, US-A-4760434
describes a vertical type MOSFET with on chip thermal and other
protection in which some of the additional components are formed as thin film
devices provided on top of and isolated from insulated gate field effect transistor or
MOSFET and some integrated within an opposite conductivity type isolation well
region provided within a first region which generally is an epitaxial layer and forms
at least a drain drift region of the semiconductor body. Where such integrated
components are provided the possibility for parasitic bipolar transistor action
between the components, the isolation well region and the first region arises
especially when the voltage at the insulated gate of the insulated gate transistor
goes, in the case of an n-channel device, negative with respect to the source
voltage. Generally it is not possible to reduce the possibility of such parasitic bipolar
problems without altering the thickness and/or doping concentration of the first
region in a manner which is detrimental to the characteristics of the MOSFET.
Accordingly in such circumstances, a compromise has to be reached between a
structure suitable for inhibiting parasitic bipolar action and an optimum structure for
the MOSFET. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device
in which the above mentioned problems are reduced or at least mitigated.According to the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor
device as defined in claim 1. Thus in a semiconductor device in accordance with the invention, the first
and second rectifying elements act to reduce the base-emitter voltage of the
parasitic bipolar transistor and so reduce the possibility of unwanted
