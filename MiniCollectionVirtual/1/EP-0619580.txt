<ABSTRACT>
A method which manages with as few measuring points as possible to monitor the contents of a data memory consists in that the memory is divided into memory segments, each of which comprises a plurality of memory cells, that for each memory segment an access probability is determined from the frequency of accesses to the memory segment and the number of memory cells of the latter and that the number of memory cells in the individual memory segments serving as monitoring measuring points is chosen to be proportional to the access probability determined for each memory segment.
