<ABSTRACT>
A bulk material container, in particular a flexible bulk container (FIBC) essentially consists of a fabric made of high-resistance plastic threads or strips. In order to determine the stress due to solar radiation, the bulk material container bears at least one indicator element (4; 4") at a spot (6; 7; 7') exposed to the sun. The indicator element senses reproducibly visible or measurable property changes depending on the solar radiation acting on the fabric. In particular, the indicator elements (4") consist of plastic foil strips which may be cut off for testing transport containers.

<CLAIMS>
Bulk container, in particular a flexible bulk 
container (FIBC), which is made essentially of a woven 

fabric of high-strength plastics filaments or tapes, 
characterised in that the bulk container bears at least 

one indicator element (4; 4'; 4"; 40) at a point (6; 7; 
7'; 10; 12; 12') which is exposed to the sun, and that 

the indicator element undergoes reproducible, visible 
or measurable changes of property according to the 

solar radiation acting on the woven fabric. 
Bulk container according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the indicator element (4; 4'; 4") consists of a 

woven fabric, a film, a nonwoven fabric or a layer 
which changes at least one of its physical properties, 

e.g. its strength or colour, in a measurable or 

reproducible manner under a defined insolation. 
Bulk container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the indicator element(s) (40; 4', 

4") is/are worked into the woven fabric (2) and/or 
attached to the woven fabric (2). 
Bulk container according to at least one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the indicator element(s) 

(4") consist(s) of plastics film strips which can be 
cut off the transport containers for examination. 
Bulk container according to at least one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that indicator elements are 

located  
 


in the neck region (6) of the container, 
in the top region (10), 
at the side faces (12, 12') and/or 
at the transport loops (7, 7'). 
Bulk container according to at least one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the woven fabric (2) is 

made of olefin filaments (3) or tapes with which 
filaments (3') or tapes which may be electrically 

conductive and also consist essentially of an olefin 
are interwoven.
