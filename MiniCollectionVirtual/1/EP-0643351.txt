<ABSTRACT>
It is possible to reload the instructions for the microprogram memory (control memory) (CM). Based on this, protection is carried out merely by means of parity bits coupled with sequentially cyclic testing of the stored instructions in the idle state (IDLE-CTL) of the processor unit (PROC) by means of a test routine (CM-test). The actual reading/testing mechanism for an addressed instruction is triggered by a subfunction (CM-LD) and is carried out under the control of hardware in the same way as a subroutine jump. In the case of reloading a faulty instruction or loading the entire microprogram memory again after operatively connecting replacement chips, the hardware control is likewise activated by the subfunction (CM-LD) and another writing operation for the instruction provided is connected upstream of the reading operation. In this way, more rarely used program sections, in particular for the treatment of errors, can also be kept largely free from errors, with the result that they do not lead to a machine state which blocks the existing debugging (error correction) capability.
