<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for loading bars in an automatic lathe 
comprises a pusher (13) with handling means (15, 18) to 

push axially the leading end of a bar (12) into a lathe 
chuck (11) to be grasped by lathe means (21) moving 

parallel to the bar axis to feed the bar under machining 
tools (31). The pusher (13) with its own handling means 

(15, 18) is supported on a truck (24) moving along guides 
parallel to the direction of movement of the bar (12). The 

truck (24) comprises connection means (30) to be 
constrained to the lathe bar-feed means for moving 

synchronously therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for sequentially
loading bars into an automatic lathe.The document FR-A-2 190 558 describes a device having the features
of the preamble of claim 1.In the known art there are automatic lathes which receive
sequentially by means of special loaders bars from which
to make pieces or machined sections. The loader inserts
axially the end of a bar behind the lathe chuck. The chuck
comprises a clamp which grasps the bar and moves it
axially beneath the machining tools for a length
predetermined to be the actual length of the work to be
machined. After completion of machining of the workpiece
it is cut off and the clamp withdraws by running along the
bar to return to the starting position, grasp the bar
again and again advance to feed beneath the tools the
section to be machined. The sequence of operations is
repeated until the bar is exhausted. At this point the
loader withdraws the remaining bar stub, discards it and
inserts a new bar in the lathe so that the machining cycle
can resume automatically.There being inserted in the lathe only a short section of
bar at a time, for the entire cycle of machining the bar
is supported at the rear by the loader in such a manner
that the bar can rotate in the chuck without bending or
vibration. In addition, the rear end of the bar must
remain constrained to the loader so that the final stub to
be discarded can be withdrawn.For the productivity of the machining station consisting 
of the combination of loader and lathe, it is essential
that all the operations follow at high speed. In the
embodiments of the known art a problem is synchronised
operation of the loader and lathes especially during
feeding of the sections to be machined and return of the
clamp to the starting position.Indeed, the bar must remain constrained at the rear to a
loader clamp which is moved by a kinematic device, usually
a chain, so as to push the bar into the lathe and
subsequently withdraw the stub to be discarded. But during
machining the bar must be moved with precision by the
lathe clamp which thus moves not only the bar but must
overcome the friction of the mechanism (in the meantime
placed in idle) for movement of the loader clamp.In addition to being difficult due to the effort required
and for possible positioning errors it is also dangerous
due to the possibility that the bar tail could slide out
of the loader clamp, where it is usually held merely by
elastic grip, during forward acceleration of the lathe
clamp. Furthermore, during rearward travel
