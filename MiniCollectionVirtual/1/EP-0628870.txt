<ABSTRACT>
A device designed to compensate the level of chemical 
treatment baths automatically, applicable in particular 

to film developing machines, comprises a vessel (90) 
containing a supply of water which is directed by means 

of a pump (50) and a relative pipeline (51) through a 
manifold (7) and toward the baths (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) 

by way of relative feed pipelines (71, 72, 73, 74, 75), 
each controlled by a relative solenoid valve (61, 62, 

63, 64, 65) piloted to operate simultaneously with the 
pump (50) by way of an electronic control unit (41) in 

receipt of signals relayed from sensors (21, 22, 23, 
24, 25) designed to detect a drop in the level of the 

solutions in the relative baths (11, 12, 13, 14, 15). 
The feed outlets of the pipelines (71, 72, 73, 74, 75) 

discharge above the level of the relative bath (11, 12, 
13, 14, 15) so as to prevent any possibility of reflux, 

whilst in the case of the pipeline (75) serving the 
final bath (15), water is supplied by way of a tubular 

element (81) with holes (85) strategically placed to 
generating jets directed onto at least one roller (321) 

of a set of paired squeeze rollers (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device such as will 
allow of controlling and compensating the level of 
chemical treatment baths automatically, in particular 
for application to automatic machines for developing 
photographic film and/or exposed light-sensitive paper, 
and more precisely, allowing automatic compensation of 
the loss of water from such baths through evaporation. 
Conventionally, in automatic machines for developing 
exposed photographic film or printed light-sensitive 
paper, known as film developers and print developers, 
one has sets of baths containing aqueous solutions of 
suitable chemical products required for the progressive 
implementation of various processing stages through 
which the film or paper to be treated will be directed 
gradually. Likewise conventionally, the entire operation will be 
carried out at a temperature of 40 C approx, and the 
interior of the relative enclosure is continuously 
ventilated to the end of expelling such vapours as may 
be given off.  During such operation, the passage of the film or paper 
through the treatment baths will occasion a gradual 
depletion of the solutions: this is compensated by the 
addition of corresponding fresh chemical solutions, a 
step piloted automatically on the basis of the surface 
treated. Besides depletion by consumption, with liquid being 
removed gradually as the treated film or paper is fed 
through, there is at the same time a certain loss due 
to evaporation of the water in the different solutions, 
occasioning a drop in level of the various baths which 
hitherto has been compensated by adding an appropriate 
quantity of water manually. Whether processing is interrupted temporarily, with 
breaks occurring normally once per day and lasting for 
the full shutdown period, typically from the evening 
when operation is suspended through to the following 
morning, or more especially where breaks are of longer 
duration such as at weekends or over holiday periods 
when stoppages may run even into a number of days, the 
evaporation of water occasions a corresponding drop in 
the level of the baths which is pronounced to a greater 
or lesser degree and cannot be compensated simply by 
the addition of new solution, as this would result in a 
progressively higher concentration tending to change  
 
the characteristics of the treatment, besides bringing 
further drawbacks, namely, the formation of deposits 
due to crystallization on the components by which the 
film or paper is conveyed through the various treatment 
bath
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for automatic compensation of the level of 
chemical treatment baths, applicable in particular to 

developing machines, whether film developing machines 
or print developing machines, substantially comprising 

a vessel (90) containing a supply of water, connected 
by way of a pipeline (51) to a manifold (7) from which 

further pipelines (71, 72, 73, 74, 75) are taken off, 
each disposed in such a manner as to feed water from 

the vessel to a respective bath (11, 12, 13, 14, 15), 
each bath (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) fitted with a relative 

sensor (21, 22, 23, 24, 25) designed to detect a drop 
in the level of a corresponding solution contained in 

each of the baths and relay a respective signal to an 
electronic monitoring and control unit (41) connected 

to and controlled in its turn by the main processing 
unit (42) governing the operation of the machine, all 

of which conventional, 
characterized 

in that the pipeline (51) from the vessel (90) connects 
with a single pump (50) by which the water is directed 

through the manifold (7) to feed pipelines (71, 72, 73, 
74, 75) controlled by relative solenoid valves (61, 62, 

63, 64, 65), each piloted to operate by the electronic 
monitoring and control unit (41) in response to the 

 
signal relayed by the respective sensor (21, 22, 23, 

24, 25) which simultaneously activates the pump (50); 
in that the outlets of the feed pipelines (71, 72, 73, 

74, 75) are positioned to discharge above the level of 
the relative baths (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) and disposed 

each at a distance above the corresponding level such 
as will create a clear separation in flow sufficient to 

prevent any reflux and consequently the risk of mutual 
contamination between the baths (11, 12, 13, 14, 15); 

and in that the feed pipeline (75) supplying water to 
the final bath (15), particularly in the application of 

the device to film developing machines, is connected to 
at least one tubular element (81) affording suitable 

holes (85) and positioned longitudinally, parallel with 
and above one relative roller (321) of an assembly of 

paired squeeze rollers (31, 32) conventionally forming 
part of such machines, and in such a manner that water 

jetted from the holes and directed strategically toward 
the roller (321) will serve to moisten this same roller 

and other squeeze rollers (322, 311, 312) of the pairs 
simultaneously and thus bring about a de-encrustation 

of deposits liable to form particularly over periods of 
prolonged duration when the operation of the developing 

machine is suspended, the water directed at the squeeze 
rollers (321, 322, 311, 312) flowing thereafter into 

 
the bath (15) beneath and serving thus to compensate 

the relative level also. 
A device as in claim 1, comprising further tubular 
elements (82, 83, 84), identical in every respect to 

the at least one tubular element (81) and associated 
respectively with the remaining squeeze rollers (322, 

311, 312), wherein such further tubular elements (82, 
83, 84) are connected in the manner of the first (81) 

to the same feed pipeline (75) in such a manner as to 
perform the selfsame function to better effect. 
A device as in claims 1 and 2, wherein the hole or 
holes of the tubular element (81) or elements (82, 83, 

84) may consist in circular apertures or in one or more 
longitudinal slots.
