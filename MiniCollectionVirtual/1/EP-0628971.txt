<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a conductive resin 
composition. The method comprises kneading carbonaceous 

conductive material, together with a solvent, in a 
medium stirring mill, and mixing the resultant slurry-form 

kneaded mixture which contains the carbonaceous 
conductive material pulverized to an average particle 

size of up to 20 µm into a resin matrix. 
The invention achieves a highly uniform dispersion 
of the carbonaceous conductive material in resins. 

Furthermore, the conductive material is easily mixed 
into the resin matrix, and the final resin has an 

excellent conductivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a conductive resin composition. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a novel conductive resin composition
which is useful in a wide range of areas including paint,
ink, rubber, and plastics, has a uniform dispersion of
carbonaceous conductive material, permits the achievement of a
high conductivity, and is easy to handle.Resin compositions having imparted conductivity have
conventionally been used for applications such as paint,
ink, rubber and various plastics. As such conductive
resin compositions there are known materials prepared by
blending a conductive filler such as metal powder or fibre,
carbon black or carbon fibre with a resin.Among others, carbonaceous conductive materials such
as carbon black and carbon fibre are most commonly utilized
as components of conductive resin compositions.However, such a carbonaceous conductive material which is
added to impart conductivity is difficult to disperse
into a resin as compared with ordinary carbon black. It has
therefore been impossible to inhibit agglomeration by
secondary agglutination of such conductive materials and
it has been difficult to meet the requirements for uniform 
dispersion, a high conductivity and a satsifactory
formability.Uniform dispersion into a resin to a high degree is
actually very difficult even with conductive carbons such as
Ketchen black and acetylene black, which are known to provide a high
conductivity in small amounts, and with carbon fibrils
comprising microfibrils which are attracting attention as
new carbonaceous materials (those disclosed, for example, in
U.S. Patent No.4,663,230 and Japanese Patent Provisional
Publication No. 60-500,943).For the purpose of dispersing these carbonaceous
conductive materials, it has been the conventional practice
to impart softness to a resin by, for example, heating and
mixing or by the use of a plasticizer in a large quantity,
and then directly adding a conductive material.These practices have however the drawback of possibly
causing degradation and deterioration of the resin itself
and involve problems in that the properties as a resin
composition and even the areas of application thereof may be
limited.In order to uniformly disperse a conductive material
and obtain a high conductivity with the addition of the conductive material
in a slight amount, it is necessary to achieve a higher contact
probability of particles of the conductive material and a
lower contact resistance between
