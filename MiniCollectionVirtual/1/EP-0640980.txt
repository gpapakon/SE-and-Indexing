<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory has a plurality of banks (40-1, 40-2, ..., 40-2x, 1 
to 4), a first specify unit (41,18), and a second specify unit (42, 48). The 

first specify unit (41, 18) is used to specify one of the banks by decoding 
a bank address signal (BA0, BA1; An+1, An+2) contained in a row address 

signal (A0 to An+2). The second specify unit (42, 48) is used to specify 
one of the banks by decoding the bank address signal (BA0, BA1; An+1, An+2) 

contained in the row address signal (A0 to An+2), according to bank status 
signals (S1 to S4) that indicates whether or not each of the banks (40-1, 

40-2, ..., 40-2x, 1 to 4) is activated. Therefore, the semiconductor memory 
is used for different bank configurations. Namely, with this arrangement, 

the semiconductor memory is capable of serving as a memory having a smaller 
number of banks, to thereby improve convenience.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory, and more particularly, to a semiconductor
memory having a plurality of memory cell areas called
banks.Recently, a synchronous dynamic random access
memory (SDRAM) has been provided and used for a
computer system, and the like. Further, a SDRAM having
a plurality of banks (for example, two banks, four
banks, or eight banks) has been studied and also
provided. Note that the banks maintain an active state
(in which a read/write operation can be carried out)
even under an unselected state. Fig.1 shows such a
prior art memory. The preamble of claim 1 reflects
this prior art.For example, in a SDRAM having two banks, when one
bank carries out an active operation, the other bank
simultaneously carries out a precharge operation, so
that the total operation speed becomes high. Further,
for example, a SDRAM having a plurality of banks is
used for a cache memory of a computer system, so as to
accelerate the cache operation thereof.Note that, among computer systems, some are
designed to use four-bank SDRAMs and some are designed
to use two-bank SDRAMs. In these four-bank and two-bank
SDRAMs used as the cache memory of the computer
system, the configuration of the SDRAM, i.e., the
number of the banks, is determined in accordance with
the requirement of the computer system, or the 
configuration of the computer system using the SDRAM.Nevertheless, in the prior art SDRAM having a
plurality of banks, for example, the four-bank SDRAM of
the prior art is incompatible with the two-bank SDRAM,
so that it is not applicable to the computer systems
that operate with two-bank SDRAMs. This problem of
prior art SDRAMs will be explained in detail with
reference to the accompanying drawing. The present
invention, as defined in claim 1, solves the
aforementioned problem. Particular embodiments are set
out in the present claims.An embodiment of the present invention may provide
a semiconductor memory having a plurality of banks and
able to serve as a memory having a smaller number of
banks.The semiconductor memory may be a dynamic random
access memory, or a synchronous dynamic random access
memory. In this synchronous dynamic random access
memory, a bank activation instruction and a read
instruction may be provided with a clock enable signal,
a chip select signal, a row address strobe signal, a
column address strobe signal, and a write enable
signal.The semiconductor memory may further comprise a
plurality of drivers for driving corresponding word
decoders and sense amplifiers,
