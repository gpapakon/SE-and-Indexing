<ABSTRACT>
A stabilizing and reinforcing device for vehicle-raising 
jacks, which comprise an arm (3) provided with a stirrup (18) for 

supporting the vehicle, adopting the form of a transversal 
channel with a front support portion (20), an arm (1) articulated to 

the foot (2) of the jack and a nut (7) into which the worm (6) of the 
jack is threaded. The stirrup (18) is provided with three 

downwardly directed projections (21,22,23), aligned transversally and 
situated near the channel, which projections rest against a 

transversal rod (17) fixed at the end of the stirrup (18), which has 
attached to it a central plate (24) configured as two parallel 

plates linked by another intermediate one, forming a central 
housing by means of which said stirrup (18) is articulated to the 

rod (17). The stirrup channel has a central flange (25) which projects 
downwards, to which the lower part of the plate (24) is attached, 

said lower part of the plate is attached to the end of a 
central spring (26), also attached to the carrying arm (3) of the 

stirrup. The foot (2) has a depression (27) in which there is housed 
the foot-carrying arm (1), which depression is traversed by a 

rod (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle raising 
jack, such as a "Y"-form jack, a parallelogram jack, a 
parallelogram jack with downwardly extending leg, or 
others. Known in the art are mechanical vehicle-raising 
jacks of various types, the most important being the 
following: 
a) "Y" form jack, which includes a column with a 
support foot to rest on the ground, to which column is 
articulated at an intermediate part a raising arm provided 
with an end stirrup, generally with a channel, for 
support of the corresponding vehicle, which vehicle has 
for the purpose flanges fitted near the edges of the 
lower part of the bodywork. The said column and arms are 
linked by means of a worm which is threaded to a nut 
transversally articulated to the upper part of the column, 
while one end of the worm is attached by articulation 
and rotatably to an intermediate point of the said 
raising arm, while the other end of the worm presents a 
crank or the like which permits the user to operate the 
mechanical arm to raise the vehicle and thus proceed to 
replace the corresponding faulty wheel. A jack of this 
kind is decribed in the patent DE-U-74-14229. b) Parallelogram jack, with four arms articulating 
with each other and having at their horizontal diagonal 
a worm, one of whose ends is threaded into a nut provided 
at one of the vertexes of the parallelogram, while the 
other end is rotatably attached to the opposite vertex; 
a section of the worm projects so that it can be operated 
by a crank as in the type described above. And in this  
 
jack the lower vertex of the parallelogram presents, 
articulated hereto, a plate to rest on the ground functioning 
as a foot, while the upper vertex of said parallelogram 
presents another plate functioning as a stirrup, 
to support the corresponding part of the vehicle. c) Jack which comprises a mechanism based on four 
arms articulated together and arranged in the form of a 
parallelogram, provided with a worm situated on one diagonal 
member, as in type b), which is approximately horizontal 
in the operating position of the jack, which worm 
is operated by a corresponding crank or the like. The 
front end of the worm is threaded into a nut articulated 
on the front vertex of the parallelogram, while the opposite 
end of the worm passes through a cross-member which 
is articulated on the rear opposing vertex of the said 
parallelogram. The rear end of the worm ends in a rear 
expansion section, which rotatably bears against the said 
cross-member, with advantageous

A vehicle raising jack, which comprise an arm 
(3) provided with a stirrup (18) at one end for holding 

and supporting the vehicle, adopting the form of a transversal 
channel with at least a flat front support portion, 

a column (1) to which is articulated the foot (2) 
of the jack and a nut (7) into which the worm (6) of the 

jack is threaded; 
characterized
 in that the stirrup is 
provided, at the front support portion (20) thereof, with 

three downwardly directed projections (21, 22, 23), one 
of them (21) central and the other two equidistant from 

it, aligned transversally and situated near the channel 
and at a distance from the respective side edges of said 

front portion of the stirrup, which projections rest 
against a transversal rod (17) slightly longer than the 

gap between the two equidistant projections (22, 23) and 
fixed at the end of the stirrup carrying arm, the stirrup 

having attached to it a central plate (24) of narrower 
width than the gap between the two vertical wings of the 

end of said carrying arm, said plate comprising two parallel, 
opposing plates linked by another intermediate one, 

forming a lower, central tubular part, situated in front 
of the front wall of the stirrup channel and beneath its 

front support portion (20), forming a central housing by 
means of which said stirrup is articulated freely to the 

rod, with substantial play, wherein the stirrup channel 
has a cut-back front central flange (25) which projects 

downwards, to which the lower part of the plate is attached, 
likewise projecting downwards and set below the 

housing; in that to said lower part of the plate is attached 
the end of a central spring (26), whose opposite end 

is attached to the carrying arm of the stirrup, keeping  
 

the latter centred against the rod and in a predetermined 
position; and in that the foot (2) has a centred depression 

(27) in which there is housed the corresponding 
lower part of the foot-carrying column (1), which depression 

is traversed -just above- by a transversal rod (28) 
fixed to the front part of the foot and with said column 

articulated to it, with a spring (29) being arranged 
between the foot and column.
