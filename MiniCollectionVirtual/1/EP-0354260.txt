<ABSTRACT>
A system for processing coupons, documents, or the like 
including the assembling multiple encoding and decoding of 

coupons, or other documents requiring coding for the purpose of 
making the coupon uniquely identifiable and traceable. A machine 

encodes individual coupons or booklets or other documents with 
a unique code, a subsequent machine reads the encoded coupon 

or booklet of coupons and applies additional information such as 
a person's name and address, and another unique code to the 

coupon, coupon booklet or the like, and records all of this data 
in a computer master data base. The coupons, coupon booklets, 

or the like, are then issued to the person whose name appears 
on the document. After presentation of the coupon it is then 

decoded and compared to the master data base to validate it or 
cancel it, and can be stored for demographic or geographic 

analysis in the master data base. The system may be combined 
with a retail store's automated system which reads the product 

information and calculates price after each coupon has been 
decoded. The computer compares the coupon to all purchases 

being made, and if there is a match of a presented coupon and 
an item purchased, the decoding machine validates the coupon 

and the store system then deducts the coupon credit from the 
presenter's invoice.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coupons, such as are used 
in retail trade for the granting of credits, and to the 
acquisition of information from such coupons. The invention 
may be applied to other types of documents such as the issuance 
of food stamps and other like documents where security 
uniqueness, and traceability of a document are required. In the merchandising arts the importance of demographic 
and geographic information acquired from trade coupons is well 
understood. There is also a problem of security and protection 
against improper use of trade coupons. For example, instances 
are known in which large numbers of coupons are fraudulently 
delivered to the issuer for reimbursement of the face value of 
the coupons without the sale of the corresponding merchandise 
having been made. United States Patent 3,108,824 to Fischer, et al,  
 
October 29, 1963 for Periodical Containing Coupons and Method 
of Processing Thereof describes coupons coded for price and 
for other information. After the coupons have been redeemed 
a code reading machine reads the codes from the redeemed, 
coupons and derives demographic or geographic information, or 
both. United States Patent 4,097,067 to Schechter, June 27, 
1978 for Printed Coupon Folder (a continuation-in-part of 
United States Patent 4,010,964) describes a direct mail 
promotional package of coupons which may be imprinted with 
the universal product code for reading by scanner to assure 
that the purchaser is entitled to the credit provided by the 
coupon, and that the coupon credit is indeed for a product 
purchased. United States Patent 3,211,470 to Wilson, October 12, 1965, 
describes a coded coupon carrying various information about 
the product, expiration date of the coupon, and other informa­
tion. The coupon is coded along two areas and employs a self-­
checking type of coding. The coupon coding provides parity 
checking and regeneration codes, as well as data about 
manufacturer, product, and counterfeit checking code. United States Patent 3,734,534 to Fishkin, et al, May 22, 
1973 for "Dual Document", describes a coupon having a middle 
section and two separable end sections. United States Patent  
 
4, 139,149 to Crepeau, et al, February 13, 1979, for Display 
System describes a code reader for reading product codes, 
a computer for processing the coded data, and display units 
for serially displaying data withdrawn from computer storage. United States Patent 4,365,148 to Whitney, December 21, 
1982, describes a system for attaching a

1. A method for producing trackable documents comprising 
the steps of: 

applying a unique code to each document; 
reading said unique code from each document and recording 

data representative of said code in a data base; 
assembling one or more documents into a package means; 

applying a person code to said package means; and 
recording data representative of said person code in said 

data base in such a manner that it is associated with the data 
representative of said unique codes of the documents assembled 

in said package means, so that the unique code on a document can 
be used to identify uniquely the person code applied to the 

package means in which said document was assembled.-- 
2. A method of claim 11 wherein said documents 
comprise coupons and said unique code comprises a first code 

representative of a first identifying characteristic of said 
coupon and a second code uniquely identifying said coupon.-- 
3. The method of claim 12 wherein said first identifying 
characteristic of said coupon is the manufacturer of the product 

to which the coupon pertains.-- 
4. The method of claim 11 wherein said package means 
comprises a booklet.-- 
5. The method of claim 11 wherein said package means 
comprises a means for mailing.-- 
6. The method of claim 15 wherein said person code 
comprises a mailing address.-- 
7. The method of claim 16 wherein said documents 
comprise coupons and said method further comprises the steps of 

decoding said unique code on a coupon when it is redeemed at a 
location and using said data base to identify the mailing 

address to which said coupon has been mailed.-- 
8. The method of claim 17 further comprising the step of 
storing data in said data base indicating which unique codes 

have been found on redeemed coupons so that said data base may 
be used to identify the amount and type of coupon use associated 

with each person code.-- 
9. A method for producing trackable documents comprising 
the steps of: 

applying a unique code to each document; 
assembling one or more of said documents in a package means; 

applying a contents code to said package means corresponding 
 

to the unique codes on the documents in said package means; 
applying a person code to said package means; 

reading said contents code and said person code on each 
package means; and 

recording data representative of said contents code and its 
associated person code in a data base, so that the unique code 

on a document can be used to uniquely identify the person code 
on the package means into which said document was packaged.-- 
10. The method of claim 19 wherein said documents 
comprise coupons.-- 
11. The method of claim 20 wherein said package means 
comprises a booklet.-- 
12. The method of claim 20 further comprising the steps 
of decoding said unique code on a coupon when it is redeemed at 

a location and using said data base to identify the person code 
for the package means from which said coupon came.-- 
13. The method of claim 22 further comprising the step of 
storing data in said data base indicating which unique codes 

have been found on redeemed coupons so that said data base may 
be used to identify the amount and type of coupon use associated 

with each person code.-- 
14. A method of tracking a plurality of documents 
distributed to a variety of recipients, comprising the step of: 

applying a unique code to each document; 
providing an individual person code for each recipient of at 

least one of the documents; 
recording the unique codes and the individual person codes 

in a data base in such a way that each unique code is associated 
with only one of the person codes; 

scanning the unique codes on the documents when they are 
used and using the data base to identify the individual person 

code associated with the unique code on the used document; and 
using that identification information to create a second 

data base identifying which individual recipients used which 

particular documents.-- 
15. The method of claim 24 wherein said documents are 
merchandise-related coupons which can be used when a recipient 

purchases a product to which the coupon relates.-- 
16. The method of claim 24 wherein the individual person 
codes comprise a name and a mailing address.--
