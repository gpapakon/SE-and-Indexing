<DESCRIPTION>
THIO-SUBSTITUTED NITROGEN-CONTAINING HETEROCYCLIC PHOSPHONATE COMPOUNDS FOR TREATING ABNORMAL CALCIUM AND PHOSPHATE METABOLISM.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel nitrogen-containing, thio- substituted, heterocyclic phosphonate compounds, including bisphosphonates, phosphonoalkylphosphinates, phosphono- carboxylates, and phosphonosulfonates. This invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these novel compounds, as well as to a method of treating or preventing certain metabolic bone disorders characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism, utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.Specifically, this invention relates to a method of treating or preventing osteoporosis and arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, by utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.A number of pathological conditions which can afflict warm¬ blooded animals involves abnormal calcium and phosphate metab¬ olism. Such conditions may be divided into two broad categories. 1. Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobi¬ lization of calcium and phosphate leading to general or specific bone loss, such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease,or excessively high calcium in the fluids of the body; such as hypercalcemia of tumor origin. Such conditions are sometimes referred to herein as pathological hard tissue demineralizations. 2. Conditions which cause or result from deposition ofTITUTE SHEEi 

 calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. These conditions are sometimes referred to herein as pathological calcifications. The first category included the most common metabolic bone disorder, osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be subclassified as menopausal , senile, drug-induced (e.g. adrenocorticoid, as can occur in steroid therapy); disease-induced (arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the manifestations are essentially the same. In general, there are two types of osteoporosis: primary and secondary. "Secondary osteoporosis" is the result of a separate identifiable disease process or agent. However, approximately 90% of
