<ABSTRACT>
Synthetic bristles made of a thermoplastic or thermosetting plastic material are proposed, in which reinforcing fibres are embedded to increase the bending rigidity, resistance to abrasion and resistance to breakage, which reinforcing fibres are preferably formed by glass fibres, aramide fibres, carbon fibres or high-strength polyethylene fibres. The fibres can be introduced as short fibres and/or long fibres or in the form of at least one continuous fibre tuft. The plastic material of the bristle can be extruded together with the reinforcing fibres, but it is also possible to manufacture the plastic bristles in one pultrusion process.
