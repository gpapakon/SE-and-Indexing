<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a throttle valve which has a housing (1) in which there is a throttle passage. Two connection openings (29, 30) of the throttle passage (28) allow the connection of devices supplying or removing pressure medium. Interacting with the throttle passage (28) is a throttle member (17), which is arranged on the housing (1) and can be adjusted so as to regulate the flow rate. One of the connection openings (30) is provided on the throttle member (17), that section (34) of the throttle passage (28) adjoining it passing through the throttle member (17). In this way, one connection end coincides with the adjustment side of the throttle valve, thereby reducing the installation space required.

Restrictor valve with a housing (1) in which runs a 
restrictor passage (28) which communicates with two connection 

openings (29, 30) for the supply and/or removal of fluid pressure 
medium, and with a restrictor element mounted on the housing (1), 

working in conjunction with the restrictor passage (28) and 
adjustable to and fro in a setting direction (23) relative to the 

housing (1) in order to vary the flow cross-section, wherein 
a connection opening (30) aligned in the setting direction (23) 

is provided on the restrictor element (17) and is joined by a 
section (34) of the restrictor passage (28) which passes through 

the restrictor element (17), characterized in that the other 
connection opening (29) is provided on the housing (1) and that 

the restrictor element (17) is fixed, unable to rotate relative 
to the housing (1), with reference to the axis of its adjustment 

movement running in the setting direction (23), and engages via 
a threaded connection (22) with an annular or sleeve-shaped 

actuating element (7) which coaxially encompasses it and is 
mounted rotatably relative to the housing (1) and unadjustable 

in the setting direction (23). 
Restrictor valve according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the two connection openings (29, 30) are aligned coaxially and 

assigned to opposite sides of the housing (1). 
Restrictor valve according to claim 2, characterized in that 
a non-return valve assembly (55) is mounted coaxially in the 

housing (1) between the two connection openings (29, 30). 
Restrictor valve according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one of the two connection openings 

(30) is assigned a plug-in connection device (67) for releasable 
connection of pressure medium lines and/or hoses.  

 
Restrictor valve according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the restrictor element (17) forms the housing of a plug-in 

connection device (67), with a collet (68) - externally actuable 
and with reference to the restrictor element (17) in particular 

freely rotatable - resting in the assigned restrictor passage 
section (34). 
Restrictor valve according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the restrictor element (17) has a sleeve-shaped 

section of length (26) containing the assigned connection 
opening (30) and adjoined coaxially by a restrictor section (37), 

in particular pin- or spigot-shaped, working in conjunction with 
the restrictor passage (28), wherein between the sleeve-shaped 

section of length (26) and the restrictor section (37), one or 
more passages (35) are provided in the circumferential area of 

the restrictor section (37), through which the section (34) of 
the restrictor passage (28) running in the restrictor element 

(17) communicates with the section of the restrictor passage (28) 
running in the housing (1). 
Restrictor valve according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a locking element (72) is provided to fix 

the relative position between the restrictor element (17) and the 
actuating element (7), and is expediently formed by a lock nut 

(74) supported by the restrictor element (74) and capable of 
being tightened by the actuating element (7). 
Restrictor valve according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the actuating element (7) is pivotably 

mounted by a sleeve-shaped guide section (80)in a recess of the 
housing (1), and has an actuating section (13) adjoining the 

guide section (8) and lying outside this recess, and expediently 
extending radially outwards relative to the guide section (8).  

 
Restrictor valve according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the housing (1) has an essentially 

cylindrical external contour, with the two connection openings 
(29, 30) being assigned to the two opposite end faces of the 

housing (1).
