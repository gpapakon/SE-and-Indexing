<ABSTRACT>
The printing machine (press) according to the invention includes, for a given cylinder, first means for displacement from a first position, corresponding to the working position, into a second position, and second means for displacement from the said second position into a third position; the shaft (5) of this cylinder (3) includes an individual drive motor and gearwheels (6) at its two ends; the second displacement means comprise a set of two racks (15) in which the gearwheels (6) can mesh, so that the displacement of the said cylinder (3) from the second to the third position is obtained by virtue of the rotation of the motor for driving the shaft (5) of the said cylinder. This may be a machine with automatic changeover of screen rollers with at least two screen rollers (3, 3') with double displacement. It may be a machine with automatic washing of the plate cylinder with a counterpressure cylinder (2) with double displacement.

Printing machine equipped with a plurality of cylinders, and 
comprising, for a given cylinder (3, 2), first means for displacement from a 

first position corresponding to the work position to a second position and 
second means for displacement from said second position to a third 

position, characterized in that the shaft (5,19) of said double-displacement 
cylinder (3, 2) comprises an individual drive motor and toothed wheels (6, 

25) at its two ends, and in that the second displacement means comprise a 
set of two racks (15, 31) in which the toothed wheels (6, 25) may mesh so 

that the displacement of said cylinder (3, 2) from the second to the third 
position is obtained thanks to the rotation of the drive motor of the shaft (5, 

19) of said cylinder. 
Printing machine according to claim 1, characterized in that each 
end of the shaft of the double-displacement cylinder is fast with a slide 

block (7, 26), in that the first displacement means comprise a first set of two 
slideways (8, 9 and 27, 28) defining the path of said slide blocks between 

the first and the second positions and are adapted simultaneously to 
displace said two slide blocks in said slideways. 
Printing machine according to claim 2, characterized in that each 
slide block (7) comprises a rack (11), and in that the first displacement 

means comprise a motor driving a pinion (16) adapted to mesh on said rack 

(11). 
Printing machine according to claim 2, characterized in that each 
slide block (26) comprises a notch (43), and in that the first displacement 

means comprise a motor driving two vertical ballscrews, each screw having 
a length at least equal to the distance between the first and the second 

position and being adapted to pass in the notch (43), so that the nut of the 
ballscrew (45) supports the slide block between the first and the second 

positions, and in that the nut of the ballscrew (45) may emerge from the 
notch (43) and be disengaged from the slide block between the second and 

the third positions. 
Printing machine according to claim 1 with automatic change of 
screened ink rollers, characterized in that it comprises at least two screened 

ink rollers (3, 3') with double displacement, one being in the fourth, so-called 
storage position, whilst the other is in the first, so-called work  

 
position, and in that it comprises third means for displacement of said 

screened ink rollers (3, 3') from the fourth to a second position, which is in 
the same direction as the displacement from the second position to the third 

position, the change of screened ink rollers (3, 3') being effected by 
actuating the first, second and third displacement means so that the roller 

(3) which is in work position passes to the second then the third position 
and in that the roller (3') which is in the fourth, storage position passes to 

the second then to the first, work position. 
Printing machine according to claims 1, 3 and 5, comprising a 
plate cylinder, characterized in that, as the screened ink roller (3) is placed 

above the plate cylinder (1), the first direction is vertical, in that the third 
displacement means also comprise said set of racks (15) in which the 

toothed wheels (6') of said screened ink roller (3') which is in the fourth 
position may mesh, in that it comprises a second and a third set of 

horizontal sideways (13, 14) extending respectively between the second 
and the fourth and between the second and the third positions, in that it 

comprises two transfer pieces (10), with rack (12), arranged so that the two 
transfer pieces (10) support the slide blocks (7) of the screened ink roller (3) 

in work position and in that the passage of said roller (3) from the first to the 
second position is effected by drive of the pinions (16) meshed on the racks 

(11, 12) of the slide blocks (7) then of the transfer pieces (10), and in that 
the passage of the rollers (3, 3') from the second to the third or from the 

fourth to the second position is effected by drive of the toothed wheels (6, 
6') of the rollers (3, 3') meshed on the set of racks (15) and by slide of the 

slide blocks (7, 7') on the second or the third set of horizontal slideways (13, 
14). 
Printing machine according to claim 6, characterized in that a 
screened ink roller (3) may pass from the third position to the fourth, storage 

position by displacement on the horizontal slideways (13, 14) and on the 
upper face of the slide blocks (7) of another screened ink roller (3') which is 

in standby position, said upper face being in line with the horizontal 
slideways (13, 14). 
Printing machine according to claim 1, characterized in that it

position and an extended position in which the ballscrew (45) penetrates 

between the prongs of the fork above the nut of the ballscrew, the passage 
between the retracted position and the extended position of the fork being

pushes the first shoulder (40) and drives the mobile piece (39) on a second 

position such that the slide block (38) which is housed between the other
