<ABSTRACT>
A device (8) for mounting a burner (6) in a cooling 
panel (4) of an electric arc furnace (2) includes a cast 

copper body containing a burner aperture (12), a cooling 
water manifold (16) and a frusto-conical outer surface (50) 

which is adapted to fit snugly into a complementary 
aperture in the cooling panel (4). A convex upper surface 

(38) of the device acts to shed scrap falling down an inner 
face of the cooling panel (4) both laterally away from the 

device and inwardly towards the furnace interior 10. The 
tapered fit between the device (8) and the cooling panel 

(4) minimizes leakage and facilitates separation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a burner mounting 
device for use in a furnace such as an electric arc furnace 
in which "cold" spots are provided with supplementary 
heating from burners supplied with oxygen and a fossil 
fuel, or oxygen alone. Electric arc furnaces are customarily provided with 
one or more carbon electrodes which are lowerable into the 
furnace to establish electric arcs in order to melt scrap 
metal placed in the furnace. Due to the localised nature 
of the heating effected by the arcs and also due to recent 
developments in electric arc furnace design which have 
resulted in furnaces which have a highly non-circular 
horizontal cross-section in their lower region so called 
cold spots exist when the furnace is being operated. In 
order to heat up these cold spots burners are often 
provided which project through the wall of the furnace. Inner walls of the furnace are lined with panels 
containing passages through which cooling water flows. The 
panels extend down as far as a base made of a refractory 
material. Recent design developments have resulted in 
furnaces with a bottom tap outlet for the molten metal, 
with a consequence that the extent to which the furnace is 
tilted for pouring out the molten metal is significantly 
reduced. This in turn means that the water cooled panels 
may extend to a lower point in the furnace. The 
consequence of this is that burners may be situated at a 
lower point in the furnace. It is particularly 
advantageous to place the burners as low as possible, 
since, if they are placed at a high level the scrap level  
 
falls (due to melting) to a point below the burners at an 
earlier stage in the melting process. The two consequences 
of this are (i) the burner becomes largely ineffective in 
the melting process and (ii) deleterious flame impingement 
on the electrodes occurs. The latter drawback is 
particularly undesirable as the expense involved in 
electrode replacement in such a furnace represents a 
significant portion of the running costs. By positioning 
the burners at a low point in the furnace they are exposed 
to a particularly aggressive environment, for example a 
rapid increase in slag volume may occur when there is an 
abrupt fall of scrap into the slag causing slag boil, or 
when the slag chemistry is not controlled correctly. In prior art furnaces where there is a requirement 
to mount a burner in a cooling panel, a parallel sided 
square section mounting box fabricated from welded steel 
plates has been provided. Such a mounting
