<ABSTRACT>
The oil content of a waxy isomerate is determined by means of 
optical, e.g. NIR, radiation. This information can then be employed 

to control the separation of oil from the waxy isomerate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a method for determining
isomerate oil content of an isomerate oil containing hydrocarbon
feedstream. The result obtained can be employed in the
optimization of an isomerization process.Such processes include the isomerization of a hydrocarbon
feed to create a product (i.e., isomerate) whose economic value
exceeds that of the feed material. Isomerization is generally carried
out with a catalyst and under reaction conditions chosen to maximize
conversion consistent with target product specifications. Plant
operating strategies attempt to maximize the production of isomerate
product within certain constraints such as feed rates, catalyst
lifetimes, process parameters (e.g., temperature and pressure), and
desired product properties which may be dependent upon the degree of
conversion. Process models are sometimes developed and employed which
permit the plant operator to optimize run lengths; thereby achieving
maximum profitability within the practical constraints. Typically,
the process is allowed to run for a predetermined time, either continuous
or batch, established by experience and model calculations. This
predetermined time (i.e., run-length) is not always optimum due to
feed variability, imperfections in the process model and uncertainties
in catalyst activity and actual process conditions. The net result is
that the process may be terminated prematurely, or allowed to proceed
longer than would be optimum. In the first instance, profitability is
diminished since the catalyst and the capital-intensive plant equipment
are not fully utilized. In the second instance, for example, by
allowing the process to run for a time longer than is optimum, feed
material will not be adequately converted into valuable isomerate
product when the catalyst has exceeded its useful lifetime. The net
result is the unwanted production of lesser-valued material which,
when blended with the higher-valued material produced during the early
stages of the run, reduce the quality (i.e., net value) of the final
product. Additionally, storage costs are incurred for products having
off-target specifications. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of
determining isomerate oil content of an isomerate oil containing hydrocarbon feedstream,
comprising the steps of:
(a) irradiating said hydrocarbon feedstream with radiation having wavelength in the
range of 700 nm to 2800 nm; (b) determining the optical absorptivity of said hydrocarbon feedstream for
each of a pair of
