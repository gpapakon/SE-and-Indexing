<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
amphiphilic-solvent based systems and more specifically to
the fragmentation of such systems by means of a novel
method. Thus, by means of said novel method systems, which
are otherwise homogeneous and in equilibrum, can be
fragmented into small particles, especially colloidal
particles. These new particles are extremely well suited
as e.g. drug delivery particles or systems, but are also
useful for several other medical as well as non-medical
applications. Thus, the invention also encompasses said
new particles as well as valuable uses thereof.The use of reversed cubic and liquid crystalline
phases in the field of controlled release devices is
described in EPO 125 751 (Engstr√∂m et al 1983). However,
there are many applications where the use of a homogeneous
phase is not manageable. By the present invention it has
become possible to prepare particles, especially colloidal
particles, of such phases or similar phases, viz by means
of a new fragmentation technique. The importance of said
new technique, and the new particles obtained thereby, can
be better understood from the following brief review of
the prior art concerning other types of particles and
homogeneous phases.Essentially, there have to date been three major particulate
colloidal lipid-water systems which have been
considered as suitable for drug delivery, namely such 
based on the lamellar mesophase as liposomes, micellar-based
phases including micelles, reversed micelles, and
mixed micelles and various kinds of emulsions including
microemulsions, as well as more novel carriers as ISCOM's
(Morein 1988) (a general text concerning these systems is
Pharmaceutical dosage forms, Disperse systems 1988). The
latter system has been utilized for intravenous nutrition
since the beginning of this century and as an adjuvant
system known as the Freunds adjuvant. These are of oil-in-water
(O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) types, respectively.
Liposomes have since their discovery been extensively
investigated as drug delivery systems for various routes
and drugs. The development of new colloidal drug carrier
systems is a research area of intensive activity and it is
likely that new systems, especially new emulsion based
systems, will appear in the near future (cf. Weiner 1990a,
1990b). Lipid-based vehicles can take several different
morphological forms such as normal and reversed micelles,
microemulsions, liposomes including variants as unilamellar,
multilamellar, etc., emulsions including various types
as
