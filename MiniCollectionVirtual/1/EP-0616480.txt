<ABSTRACT>
A communication system for transmission of data from an 
ATM network to a mobile radio system comprising interface 

apparatus coupled therebetween which is operative to remove 
from the header of each ATM cell entering the said system from 

the said network, VPI and VCI data, translator means responsive 
to the VPI and VCI data for appropriately coding data comprising 

the remainder of each cell from which the said VPI and VCI data 
has been removed so that it will be received by a mobile user 

having an address as indicated by the VPI and CPI data, and 
further comprising second translator means responsive to codes 

appertaining to user addresses for producing corresponding VPI 
and VCI data, and means for recombining this VPI and VCI data 

with data comprising the remainder of the cell from which it was 
removed, thereby to produce whole cells suitable for transmission 

from the said system to a mobile terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems and more especially it
relates to mobile radio communication systems of the kind wherein an
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network is used to support a mobile radio
communication system.The principles of ATM operation are well known to those skilled in the
art and are described in patent application GB-A-2268359, published 05.01.94,
to which attention is hereby directed.In European patent application 0426269 A1, published 08.05.91, there is
disclosed a system for mobile communication having a plurality of base stations
and users. Each base station has an associated interface unit which packetises
voice information and includes header information concerning user and
destination addresses. Movement of the various users is tracked by the interface
units by passing control blocks between interface units. The stored information
within the base station interfaces allows user movement between base stations
without call loss.In ATM systems, data is transmitted over a network in small packets or
cells, which each consist of 48 octets of user significant data (known as the
information field) and 5 octets of network significant data (known as the header).
Ther term user significant data, when used herein, is intended to include any type
of information passing over the network and includes speech and/or signalling.
The header of an ATM cell contains a number of fields as follows. Two fields
comprise the Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI)
which are used to route cells across the ATM network. Thus, the combination of 
the VPI and the VCI fields define at each interface connection identity. Another
field comprises Header Error Control data (HEC) which is used to detect and
correct errors in the header. A further field contains Generic Flow Control data
(GFC) which is used to control user access and is not used within the network.
Further fields comprise the Payload Type Indicator data (PTI) and Cell Loss
Priority data (CLP) which have significance for transmission of data across an
ATM network.It will be appreciated that in order to pass ATM cells from an ATM fixed
network to a mobile terminal over a radio network, provision must be made for
transmission of at least some of the header data as well as the information field.
One method of transporting ATM cells across a radio interface between an ATM
fixed network and a mobile cellular radio terminal is to transport the full 53 octet
cell. However, as will be appreciated, this imposes a

<CLAIMS>
A communication system for transmission of data from an ATM network
to a mobile radio system (1) comprising interface apparatus (5) coupled

therebetween which is operative to remove from the header of each ATM cell
entering the said system from the said network, VPI and VCI data, translator

means (8) responsive to the VPI and VCI data for appropriately coding data such
that the code corresponds to a CDMA code, or alternatively, the code

corresponds to a TDMA timing system, said code comprising the remainder of
each cell from which the said VPI and VCI data has been removed, whereby the

translator means (8) is arranged to map the VPI and VCI data either to the
appropriate CDMA code or alternatively, to an appropriate time slot or slots of a

TDMA system, and further comprising second translator means (10) responsive
to codes appertaining to user addresses and arranged to map the CDMA code, or

alternatively the time slot or time slots of the TDMA system to produce the
corresponding VPI and VCI data, and means (11) for recombining this VPI and

VCI data with data comprising the remainder of the cell from which it was
removed, thereby to produce whole cells suitable for transmission from the said

system to a mobile terminal.
A system as claimed in Claim 1, comprising means (13) for removing
other header fields from the header and used to provide a basis for adaptation of

the remainder of the cell before it is transmitted into the mobile radio system (1),
and reconstitution means being effected to re-introduce the fields, so that the

ATM cells are sufficiently reconstituted before being re-introduced into the
ATM system. 
A system as claimed in Claim 2, comprising means (13) for removing
HEC and GFC header fields from each cell together with the VPI and VCI fields

thereby to produce an information field and truncated header which is
transmitted across the mobile radio system (1) using a code as indicated by the

VPI/VCI data, and reconstruction means for reconstructing the fields to produce
a complete cell with the appropriate header information before being re-transmitted

through the ATM system.
