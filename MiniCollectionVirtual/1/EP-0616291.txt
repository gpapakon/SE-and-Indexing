<ABSTRACT>
In a recognition/diagnosis method, a relation 
between total sums of inputs of respective cases and 

teacher data is listed in the order of magnitude of the 
total sums of inputs. Based on the value of the teacher 

data for the input having the maximum total sum and the 
number of times of change of teacher data in the table 

are considered, a configuration of a neural network (the 
number of hidden layers and the number of neurons 

thereof) is determined. Coupling weights are analytically 
calculated based on the table.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to relates to a 
recognition or diagnosis method primarily using a neural 
network for diagnosing the presence or absence of a fault 
in a current operation status by utilizing past operation 
information of various components of a power supply 
circuit such as a gas insulated switchgear (GIS) or a 
transformer. It is applicable to not only various 
engineering fields but also a medical field, and more 
generally to the recognition and diagnosis of physical, 
chemical and biological phenomena. In JP-A-2-297074, a diagnosis method by using a 
neural network is proposed. In the method, past status 
of various types of equipments are previously learnt by a 
neural network having a multi-layer structure. When new 
status of the equipments is inputted, whether the equipments 
are normal or not is determined based on the learn 
result. If they are determined to be abnormal, a cause 
therefor is inferred. In JP-A-2-272326, detailed description is made 
on mechanical vibration, acoustic vibration and electric 
oscillation of a rotary machine. In JP-A-2-100757, a learning method of a  
 
parallel neural network is proposed. It is stated 
therein that a back propagation method is becoming effective 
as a learning method. A conventional learning 
method has disadvantages in that the learning does not 
proceed once it falls in a local minimum and a precision 
of learning sharply decreases when the number of data to 
be learnt is large. In the proposed method, more than 
one neural networks are connected in parallel to serially 
learn in order to improve an efficiency and the precision 
of the learning. Other arts related to the present 
invention are disclosed in USP 5,023,045, JP-A-2-206721, 
JP-A-4-120479, JP-A-3-201079 and JP-A-3-092975. Fig. 1 shows a conventional neural network. 
Any number (one in the illustrated example) of hidden 
layers are provided between an input layer and an output 
layer. A set of input data X₁, X₂, X₃, . . . . ., Xn are 
inputted to the input layer. In Fig. 1, "1" is also 
always supplied for adjusting outputs from neurons. 
Products of those inputs and coupling weights W₁, W₂, W₃, 
. . ., Wn, Wn+1 are inputs U₁ to a neuron Ne. An output 
from the neuron is V₁. U₁ and V₁ are calculated by 
equations (1) and (2). 
   Similar equations are applied to the inputs and 
the outputs of other neurons of the hidden layers and the 
output layers. Only one Na of the neurons of each hidden 
layer is coupled with "1" for adjusting the output of a 
neuron connected
