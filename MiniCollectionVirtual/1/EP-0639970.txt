<ABSTRACT>
Competitive progesterone antagonists, including two novel steroids, viz., 11 beta ,19-[4-(cyanophenyl)-o-phenylene]-17 beta -hydroxy-17 alpha -(3-hydroxyprop-1(Z)-enyl)-4-androsten-3-one and 11 beta ,19-[4-(3-pyridinyl)-o-phenylene]
-17 beta -hydroxy-17 alpha -(3-hydroxyprop-1(Z)-enyl)-4-androsten-3-one, inhibit formation of endometrial glands at below their ovulation inhibiting dose and the abortive dose, and thus achieve oral contraception in females without adversely affecting the menstrual cycle and without risk of aborting a previous implanted fertilized egg or a fetus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the
use of a dissociated competitive progesterone antagonist
having a dissociation factor of at least 30 or higher for the
production of a pharmaceutical agent for contraception in a
female in a dosage amount which is less than an ovulation-inhibiting
dose and less than an abortion-inductive dose and
which is effective to inhibit the formation of endometrial
glands and ephitelium growth and/or to inhibit the function of
the glands which is necessary for successful implantation, for
administration during the follicular phase of the female's
menstrual cycle and optionally also in the luteal phase.By inhibiting the formation of endometrial glands and epithelium growth, the implantation of a fertilized egg in the
uterus is rendered impossible (inhibition of the uterine receptivity). The employment of competitive progesterone antagonists
according to the invention can thus be used for contraception in the female.RU 486 (11β-[4-N,N-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-17β-hydroxy-17α-propinyl-estra-4,9(10)-dien-3-one; EP-A-0057115) not within the scope of the present invention
and other 11β-aryl or 11β,19-arylene-substituted steroids are compounds which can displace progesterone and the
glucocorticoids from their respective receptors. These substances are pharmacologically distinguished by strong progesterone-
and glucocorticoid-antagonistic effects. These properties determine their previously practiced therapeutic
uses. RU 486 is useful, e.g., as a progesterone antagonist for therapeutic termination of pregnancy and also as a glucocorticoid
antagonist for treatment of Cushing's syndrome in the wake of a pathologically increased secretory activity
of the suprarenal cortex. The abortive dose of RU 486 is 200-600 mg in the female.It has also long been known that competitive progesterone antagonists are able to inhibit ovulation in various animal
species and in the human female. (Collins et al., "Blockade of the spontaneous mid-cycle gonadotropin surge in
