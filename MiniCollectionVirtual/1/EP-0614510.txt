A geared machine having at least two meshing gearwheels, 
the tooth profile thereof comprising different profile forms, 

characterised in that the tooth flanks (21) of the individual 
teeth (3; 5; 40, 50) have an involute (25) in the central region 

and an adjacent curved region (27) merging tangentially 
into a straight portion (29) directly intersecting the end 

surface (11) of the tooth, thus producing a straight line of 
action at the pitch point in the region of the involute. 
A geared machine according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the curved region (27) is preferably formed as a circular 

arc. 
A geared machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that a smooth transition is produced between the involute 

(25) of the central region and the curved region (27) by the 
radius of curvature of the curved region being substantially 

as great as the radius of curvature of the involute before it 
merges into the curved region, and in that the involute and 

the curved region preferably merge tangentially. 
A geared machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the involute (25) merges tangentially 

into the curved region (27), and in that the radius of 
curvature of the curved region is identical to that of the 

region of the directly adjacent involute of the central region. 
A geared machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the distance (L
y
) of a first imaginary 
straight line (G1), extending parallel to the end surface (11) 

of a tooth (3, 5) and intersecting the transition point between  
 

the involute (25) and the curved region (27), from the end 
surface is substantially twice as great as that of a second 

imaginary straight line (G2) extending parallel to the crest 
surface and intersecting the transition point between the 

circular arc (27) and the straight portion (29). 
A geared machine according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the ratio of the distances of the imaginary straight lines 

from the crest surface lies within the range 40:60 to 60:40, 
preferably 55:45 to 45:55, and in particular is 50:50. 
A geared machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the tooth flanks (21) of the individual 

teeth (3, 5) have a cycloid-type curve, preferably a cycloid 
(33), in the tooth base region (15). 
A geared machine according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the radius of curvature of the cycloid 

(33) substantially corresponds to the radius of curvature of 
the adjacent region of the involute (25). 
A geared machine according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the radius of curvature of the cycloid (33) and of the 

directly adjacent region of the involute (25) are identical. 
A geared machine according to claim 8 or 9, characterised 
in that the cycloid (33) merges tangentially into the curve 

leading to the tooth base region of the adjacent tooth. 
A geared machine according to claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the tooth form in the upper tooth crest 

region (25, 27, 29) is dependent upon the lower tooth form 
(25, 33, 23). 
A geared machine according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the gearwheels can be used for 

internal or external toothing.
