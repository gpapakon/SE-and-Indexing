<ABSTRACT>
A sealing top for bottles and the like, comprising a 
cap (1) which is applied to the seal (7) of a bottle (9) 

and tear lines (3a,3b,3c). It is characterized in that 
the upper end of said cap is open or free, and in that 

the tear lines (3a,3b) define tabs (4) which can be torn 
from said open or free end. 
It further comprises a skirt (2) and means (6) of 
fixing it to bottles (9) or the like, characterized in 

that the tabs (4) are arranged axially and at least one 
of the said tear lines (3b) meets a peripheral line (3c) 

arranged between the cap (1) and the skirt (2). Said tabs 
(4) form an integral part of the cap (1) of the top. 
The top is fixed to the stopper (7) of a bottle (9) 
by the fixing means (6) of the skirt (2), in such a way 

that once the top is torn (1), the skirt (2) remains 
joined to the skirt (8) of the stopper (7). 
It enables bottles to be sealed and unsealed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealing top for 
bottles and the like. The use of said tops makes it possible to determine 
by means of a simple visual observation whether or not 
bottles or the like are sealed. The use of initial seals to determine the initial 
inviolability of the contents of bottles or the like is a 
common practice. It is well known that with bottled and 
packed drinks there is a risk of fraudulent and improper 
tampering by third parties before the product reaches the 
consumer. It is for this reason that the systems which 
ensure and guarantee inviolability against such tampering 
form a known and important aspect of the field of supplying 
bottled/packed drinks. Among said systems it is worth mentioning those 
which make it possible to determine, in a simple and 
direct way, whether or not the interior of the bottle or 
container has been tampered with during the transport and 
distribution of the product. One of said known systems comprises sealable bottle 
tops which make it possible to determine, by means of 
direct visual information, whether or not the bottle or 
container has been opened since it left the factory. Various types of bottle sealing tops are currently 
known, most of them of the type which comprise an opening 
tab. Said tabs are normally defined by perforated lines 
which make it easier to tear and separate the disposable 
cap, defining the top, from the skirt thereof which may 
or may not remain fixed to the neck of the bottle once 
the top has been unsealed.  These types of tops suffer from known drawbacks, 
among which it is worth mentioning the following: 
The perforated lines are peripheral, which means 
opening the top is normally an awkward task. It is also usual for these tops to be provided 
with a single tab, with the drawback that since it is a 
possible for said tab to break, due mainly to the weakness 
of the material of which they are normally made, it 
can become even more difficult to open the top. Embodiments of sealable tops with tearable tabs 
that are separate from the tops may suffer the accidental 
tearing of said tabs during the normal handling of the 
bottles and/or containers, giving rise to losses in the 
sales of the bottled or packed product. The environmental problem regarding the pollution 
created by discarding products is also a factor which 
must be considered, since said product comprises at least 
two disposable parts, the cap and the tab. Finally, it is worth mentioning that tops currently 
come in various sizes as a

<CLAIMS>
A sealing top for bottles (9) and the like, 
comprising a body which defines a cap (1) that is applied 

to the corresponding seal (7) of the bottle (9), said 
body comprising tear lines (3a,3b,3c), characterized in 

that the upper end of said cap is open or free, and in 
that the tear lines (3a,3b) define one or more tabs (4) 

which can be torn from the open or free end of the cap 
(1). 
A top according to claim 1, comprising an upper 
part or cap (1) which is free or open at its upper end, a 

lower part or skirt (2) and means (6) of fixing said 
skirt (2) to bottles (9) or the like, characterized in 

that the tabs (4) are arranged axially or inclined relative 
to the axis of symmetry of the open cap (1) and at 

least one of said tear lines (3b) meets a peripheral tear 
line (3c) arranged between the open cap (1) and the skirt 

(2) of the top. 
A top according to the previous claims, characterized 
in that the tabs (4) form an integral part of the 

cap (1) of the top and do not protrude from the body 
thereof. 
A top according to the previous claims, characterized 
in that the tear lines (3a,3b,3c) are perforated 

lines. 
A top according to the previous claims, characterized 
in that it is fixed to the stopper (7) of a 

bottle (9) or the like by the fixing means (6) of the 
skirt (2), in such a way that once the top is torn (1), 

the skirt (2) remains joined to the skirt (8) of the 

stopper (7).
