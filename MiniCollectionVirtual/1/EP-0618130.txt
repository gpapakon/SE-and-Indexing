<ABSTRACT>
A cargo support deck (7) for a vehicle body (1) has individual 
deck segments (8) each of which are vertically moveable along a guide 

track (6). Each deck segment comprises a telescopic beam (9) with 
end fittings (10) captively connected to the guide track, and a deck 

panel 
covered with appropriate flooring material. The beam may be 

disposed centrally relative to the deck to prevent any significant 
torsional forces 

being fed to the telescoping mechanism or end fittings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cargo support decks intended for use in the 
transportation of cargo in rigid box-vans, trucks or other vehicles or containers 
(for convenience hereinafter referred to as "vehicles"). In known cargo support arrangements a plurality of elongate beams span 
the width of a vehicle and are releasably fixed in place by means of a suitable 
fitment at each end of the beam which fitment engages with a supporting structure 
on a vehicle wall. The beams can be used as a "second deck" system whereby a 
temporary platform is positioned on the beams to provide for a second deck 
carrying capacity in addition to that at floor level. Alternatively cargo in suitable 
form (e.g. large boxes) may be supported directly by the beams without the need 
for a temporary platform. It is advantageous if the second deck can be raised or lowered vertically 
according to the user's requirements and an example of a such a second deck 
arrangement is described in our pending European Patent Application No. 
91308616.1. The arrangement described comprises a plurality of cargo support 
beams each having end fitments with sliding shoes. Each end of a beam is 
captively mountable by means of a sliding shoe to a vertical track attached to the 
vehicle wall. The beam can thus be vertically displaced by means of the shoe 
sliding relative to the track. A pawl mounted in the shoe is designed to engage in 
any one of a plurality of apertures along the length of the track to allow the beam 
to be locked at a predetermined position. The end fitments or shoes are often 
mounted pivotally to the beam end and each beam has a telescopic arrangement to 
enable its effective length to be increased. This arrangement reduces the 
possibility of accidental jamming during vertical movement of the beam and 
enables one end of the beam to be raised or lowered at a time so that the beam is 
in a temporary position diagonal to the vertical track with both ends of the beam 
remaining captive to the track. A plurality of said beams are connected between 
opposite tracks along the length of the vehicle. The above described cargo support decks have two main disadvantages. First, the deck formed comprises a plurality of horizontally spaced beams. 
The presence of a wide space between adjacent beams requires the cargo to be 
self supporting whereby the distance between two adjacent beams is spanned by 
the load or to be pre-packaged into a load which likewise spans adjacent beams 
e.g. the cargo may be loaded on to a pallet of the

A cargo support deck (7:207) moveable relative to a supporting structure 
(1;201) in a substantially vertical direction characterised in that the deck 

(7;207) comprises a plurality of deck segments (8;108;208) each 
comprising a support (9;109;209) connected to a deck panel (8a;108a)and 

each being individually moveable along a guide track (6;206). 
A cargo support deck according to claim 1, characterised in that each deck 
segment (8;108;208) has a sliding shoe connector (10;120) designed to 

engage captively said guide track (6;206). 
A cargo support beam according to claim 2, characterised in that each 
sliding shoe connector (10:120) is moveable telescopically with respect to 

the deck segment (8;108:208). 
A cargo support deck according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that the support is a beam (9:109;209) mounted centrally with respect to 

the deck panel (8a;108a) along a longitiidinal axis thereof. 
A cargo support deck according to claim 4, characterised in that there is 
provided a supplementary beam (10a;210a) designed to support said deck 

segment (8;108;208) at an edge (8b; 108b) thereof remote from the 
longitudinal axis, the supplementary beam (10a;210a) being vertically 

moveable along a guide track (6:206). 
A cargo support deck according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the support is a beam (109) formed at a first edge of the deck panel 

(108a). 
A cargo support deck according to claim 6, characterised in that when 
adjacent first and second deck segments (108) are vertically aligned a 

second edge (108b) of the first deck segment (108) opposite said first edge 
is supported by part said second adjacent deck segment (108). 
A cargo support deck according to any one of claims 4 to 7, characterised 
in that the beam (9;109;209) is separable from the deck panel 

 
(8a;108a;208a). 
A cargo support deck according to any one of claims 4 to 8, wherein the 
beam is housed in an aperture (12;112) through the length of the deck 

segment (8;108). 
A cargo support deck according to any one of claims 4 to 9, characterised 
in that the beam is telescopic and the sliding shoe connector is fixed 

thereto. 
A cargo support deck according to any one of claims 2 to 10, characterised 
in that the sliding shoe has torsional reaction bearings. 
A cargo support deck according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that means (230,231) are provided to interlock adjacent deck segments 

(208) when they are in vertical alignment. 
A cargo support deck according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that the deck segments have apertures or recesses which permit circulation 

of air or gas around cargo for cooling purposes. 
A cargo support deck according to any preceding claim, characterised in 
that the deck segments are partly or fully constructed from a thermally 

insulated material.
