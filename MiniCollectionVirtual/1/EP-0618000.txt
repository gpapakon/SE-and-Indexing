<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to water soluble wetting agents for use in 
aqueous systems based upon a mixture of an alkyl sulfosuccinate and an 

alkylene oxide adduct of an acetylenic alcohol. The mixture of 
sulfosuccinate and an alkylene oxide adduct of an acetylenic alcohol 

reduces surface tension and effects solubilization of the sulfur containing 
wetting agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to water soluble, sulfur containing 
surfactant compositions of the sulfosuccinate type. Wetting agents based upon sulfur containing surfactants and 
particularly those sulfur containing surfactants known as sulfosuccinates 
are widely known and described in the literature. These wetting agents are 
used in high speed textile process operations, pressure sensitive 
adhesives, dye systems and other applications requiring surface active or 
emulsifying agents. One of the difficulties associated with sulfosuccinate wetting agents 
is that in concentrated form they are solid and paste-like. These pastes 
are difficult to dissolve in cold water. Concentrated aqueous 
sulfosuccinates may be rendered fluid by incorporating solubilizing 
additives such as water miscible alcohols. However, when solutions of 
these surfactants are dispersed in water in low concentration, the 
solubilizing agents tend to be extracted and surfactant gels form which 
then take time to dissolve. In addition many of these solubilizing agents 
tend to contribute to volatile organic component levels in the final 
product. Representative literature disclosing sulfosuccinates including 
their conversion to water soluble formulations are as follows: U.S. 2,342,150 discloses esters of sulfodicarboxylic acids, e.g., 
sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate and their application in the wetting of coal, 
coke, iron, and other industrial and mining operations. To enhance the 
water solubility of the sulfodicarboxylic acids in cold water, the esters 
of sulfodicarboxylic acids are mixed with urea with the ester to urea ratio 
being from 0.85 lb ester to 1.5-3 lb of urea. Optionally, ethylene glycol 
can be added to the mixture to lower the freezing temperature of the 
aqueous system. U.S. 2,441,341 discloses surface-active dialkyl sulfosuccinates with 
the alkyl groups having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms and their use as wetting  
 
agents. The patentees point out that these systems have been sold 
commercially as solutions in water or aqueous organic solvents or in 
admixture with inert organic or inorganic diluents. In the pure 100% form, 
the dialkyl sulfosuccinates are solid waxes and dissolve very slowly in 
water. To enhance processing of the sulfosuccinates into powders, the 
patentees report the addition of alkali metal salts of benzoic acid 
therein. U.S. 2,562,155 and 2,562,156 disclose various wetting and detergent 
compositions containing monoalkyl sulfosuccinates and solubilizing agents 
therefor. To enhance the
