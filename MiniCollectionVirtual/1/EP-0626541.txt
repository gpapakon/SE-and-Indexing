<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gas/air ratio control apparatus 
for a temperature control loop for household gas appliances, 

in particular for domestic/direct hot water units and 
combined direct hot water/central heating units, for 

temperature control of domestic and/or heating water. The 
invention is particularly suitable for household appliances 

up to 120 KW. The gas/air ratio control apparatus comprises a 
controllable fan (3) for supplying a predetermined air stream 

(2-2) to a burner (4) in dependence on the detected actual 
temperature (T
Actual
) and the desired target temperature 
(T
Target
) of the heating and/or domestic hot water; and a 
pressure-controllable valve (8) for controlling the supply of 

a specified fuel quantity (1) to the burner (4) in dependency 
exclusively on the absolute pressure of the air stream (2-2) 

produced by the controllable fan (3). The inventive 
temperature control apparatus operates in an air/fuel 

regulating range of 20% to 100%, the controllable valve (8) 
supplying a fuel quantity (1) to the burner (4) having a 

pressure at a ratio of 1:1 to the absolute pressure of the 
air stream (2-2) produced by the controllable fan (3). The 

system uses only one pressure sensing line (11) and can 
always be brought into a safe condition when faults appear in 

the burner (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a gas/air ratio control apparatus
for a temperature control loop for gas appliances, in
particular for domestic water appliances and combined
domestic water/central heating systems for the temperature
control of domestic and/or heating water. The invention is
particularly suitable for gas appliances for domestic devices
up to 120 KW.In industrial as well as domestic use, temperature control of
domestic and/or heating water is very important. For example,
a main boiler provided in many households for the central
heating system is heated by a burner. A fuel/air mixture is
fed to the boiler and the heat it generates is transferred to
the main boiler via a heat exchanger. The supplied fuel can
be gas. The firing-on and -off times for the heating boiler
can be manually set with a timer so that heating water with a
specified temperature can be made available for example in
the morning and early evening. The boiler is well insulated,
out as soon as the temperature of the burner boiler drops
below a specified threshold value temperature, the burner is
switched on via a simple on/off switching mechanism in order
to increase the water temperature within the heating boiler.
When the temperature of the boiler water has reached the
predetermined and adjustable threshold temperature, an
automatic switching off of the burner is effected.In this heating system, temperature control takes place by
means of an on/off control of the burner, which means that
either the temperature of the water from the heating boiler 
is monitored and used for control of the on/off times of the
burner, or the control of the on/off times is carried out via
a detector mounted in a room to maintain the room temperature
constant.In such known heating systems, however, it is conceivable
that the air/fuel mixture supply to the burner is controlled
to such an extent that as few harmful substances as possible
result from the combustion.On the other hand, flow heaters are known for domestic water
supply in which the application of a large quantity of energy
to a small through-flow area in a domestic water supply line
results in heating of domestic water when this goes through
the supply line. These often include electrical flow heaters
which use electrical heating coils for heating. In these,
control does not normally ensue by means of the temperature
of the domestic water, rather the predetermination of the
temperature effects the control for the heating spools to
feed a quantity of electrical energy corresponding to the
pre
