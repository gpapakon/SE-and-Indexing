<ABSTRACT>
2.1. When operating a central hot water heating system, a heating control unit prescribes the boiler water temperature, preferably depending on the weather and/or the room temperature, and switches an oil or gas burner of the boiler on and off periodically in accordance therewith. Since each renewed burner start leads to an increased emission of pollutant, it is aimed to prolong the burner running time per switching-on operation. 2.2. In order to achieve a minimization of the burner start without loss of comfort under all load conditions of a heating installation, the heating control unit is given a large switching hysteresis upon switching on the burner, independently of the boiler water temperature. Said hysteresis becomes continuously smaller with increasing running time of the burner within a prescribed period, until a minimum value of the switching hysteresis which is suitable for continuous operation is reached. 2.3. The method is particularly suitable for heating control units with a two-point output, which are used for burner control in the case of smaller central heating systems.

A method for operating a hot-water heating system with a gas or oil-fired 
boiler, whose burner is controlled by a heating-system controller, in particular 

an on-off controller, with variable switching hysteresis, characterised in that, 
when the burner is switched on, the heating-system controller receives a large 

switching hysteresis (Δϑ
K
) regardless of the boiler water temperature, said 
switching hysteresis becoming continuously smaller as the running time (t) of 

the burner increases over a predetermined time duration until a minimum 
value of the switching hysteresis (Δϑ
K
) suitable for continuous operation is 
reached. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the time duration 
between the switching-on of the burner and the reaching of the minimum 

value of the switching hysteresis (Δϑ
K
) can be set between one and ten 
minutes, but is preferably five minutes. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the maximum value 
of the switching hysteresis (Δϑ
K
) is preferably roughly 20 K and the minimum 
value roughly 5 K. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 through 3, characterised in that 
the maximum value of the switching hysteresis (Δϑ
K
) can be set and can be 
continually changed down to the minimum value.
