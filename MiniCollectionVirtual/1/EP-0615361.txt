<ABSTRACT>
A general purpose, high-speed encryption system (50) 
and method, based on a linear feedback shift register 

(LFSR) (70) that provides inputs to one or more mathematically 
independent nonlinear output functions (80A-80N), 

resulting in the generation of multiple keystream outputs 
per clock cycle. Due to the parallel architecture, the 

system need only operate at a rate of 1/N, where N is the 
number of output functions. For example, the system can 

encrypt an 8-bit byte in one-eighth the time required for 
a conventional bit-oriented stream cipher. Alternatively, 

with high-speed serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial 
interface converters, the system can encrypt a serial data 

stream at a rate N times that of the system itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to general purpose, high speed
encryption algorithms.The Government requires data protection to ensure
national security, and industry requires protection of that
information which is vital to its success. Cryptography is
the science of protecting this information from eavesdropping
and interception. The two principal objectives are
secrecy (to prevent unauthorized disclosure) and integrity
(to prevent unauthorized modification). A number of
commercial products are available to provide this protection;
however, they tend to concentrate on low to medium
speed file and data encryption. Products that protect
high-speed data networks tend to be scarce and expensive.
In addition, the mathematics underlying cryptography tends
to be so complex that few individuals are capable of
developing and mathematically proving the strength of new
cryptographic algorithms.This invention overcomes these problems. First, a
system embodying this invention can be implemented in
technologies that are much lower in cost compared to
conventional high-speed technologies (i.e., CMOS vs. GaAs).
Conversely, the current high-speed technologies can be used
to achieve data rates previously unattainable. Second, an encryption algorithm in accordance with
this invention is based on the well understood mathematics
of linear feedback shift registers and de Bruijn functions.
The open literature contains numerous references to both
topics, thus providing convenient access to the technical
details required to fully design, implement, and use the
algorithm. Due to the nonlinear nature of de Bruijn
sequences, the resulting encrypted data is very robust
against cryptanalytic attack.The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and RSA cryptoalgorithms
are the best known and most widely used products
available for comparison. DES and an algorithm in accordance
with this invention perform similar functions and can
generally be used in the same applications. However, DES
is a substitution-permutation cipher, which prevents it
from being used in high-speed applications due to the high
number of iterations that must be performed on each block
of data to be encrypted. The RSA algorithm is based on
complex mathematical functions, and is generally implemented
in a hardware-based arithmetic logic unit. A large
number of clock cycles are still required to compute the
necessary functions, again limiting it to only moderate
data rates.The Chaos-based encryption algorithm described in U.S.
