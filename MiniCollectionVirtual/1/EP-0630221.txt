<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a disposable, absorbent pants-type diaper which includes a front-part (1), a back-part (2), a crotch-part (3) between the front and back parts (1, 2), at least two side-closure parts (12, 13) which mutually join parts of the side-edges (4, 5) of respective front and back parts, so that the pants will present a waist opening (9) and two leg openings (10, 11), wherein the diaper pants further include an elongated absorbent pad (14) having a front and a rear end-part (17, 18) and an intermediate centre-part (19), an inner casing layer (15) placed on that side of the absorbent pad (14) which is intended to face the wearer in use, and an outer casing layer (16) which is placed on the other side of the absorbent pad. The invention is characterized in that at least one of the respective front and back parts (1, 2) has at least one elastically stretchable regions (29, 30); in that the crotch-part (3) is essentially non-stretchable in relation to the stretchable region (29, 30); in that at least one of respective end-parts (17, 18) of the absorbent pad (14) is disposed within one of the elastically stretchable regions (29, 30), while the centre-part (19) of the absorbent pad is disposed within the relatively non-stretchable crotch-part (3) of the pants, whereby those forces that are exerted by the elastically stretchable region (29, 30) on the end-part or end-parts (17, 18) of the absorbent pad will function to hold the absorbent pad (14) in sealing abutment with the wearer when the diaper is worn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent
pants-type diaper of the kind which is intended for one-time
use only and which comprises a front-part, a back-part,
a crotch-part that extends between said front and
back parts, at least two side-closure parts which mutually
join parts of the side-edges of the front and back
parts such that the diaper will include a waist opening
and two leg openings, said diaper further comprising an
elongated absorbent pad having a front and a rear end-part
and a centre-part located therebetween, an inner
casing layer placed on that side of the pad which is
intended to face towards the wearer in use and an outer
casing layer, or backing sheet, placed on the other side
of the absorbent pad.In the case of diaper-wearing children who are in a
transition period in which they learn to control the discharge
of urine and are weaned-off the use of conventional
diapers and trained to perform their bodily
evacuative functions on the toilet, there is a need for an
absorbent article which while absorbing body fluids will,
at the same time, resemble a pair of conventional
underpants. Absorbent pants-type diapers which are
intended to be worn during such weaning or training
periods are often referred to as training pants. One significant
difference between an absorbent pants-type
diaper and a conventional diapers is the manner in
which they are intended to be worn in daily use. Absorbent
pants-type diapers shall be capable of being taken-off
and put-on repeatedly in the same manner as a pair
of conventional underpants, until the wearer urinates in
the pants-type diaper, wherewith the urine is absorbed
by the pants, in precisely the same manner as a diaper,
so that the pants-type diaper will continue to function as
underpants in a user-safe fashion, until there is time and
the opportunity to replace the soiled pants-type diaper
with a fresh diaper. The soiled diaper can then be
thrown away. The pants-type diaper will preferably be
designed to give the wearer a decisive feeling that
he/she is wearing a garment which is different to the
diapers earlier used, and so that the wearer is able to
remove the diaper easily, for instance when going to the
toilet. In this latter respect, it is important, among other
things, to give the pants-type diaper the form of a pair of
pants, i.e. an article which has a waist opening and two
leg openings, and not the form of a diaper that has fastener
tabs or the like for joining the back-part of the diaper
to the front-part thereof when putting-on the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An absorbent pants-type diaper which is
intended for one-time use only and which comprises

front-part (1), a back-part (2), a crotch-part (3)
between the front and back parts (1,2), at least two

side-closure parts (12, 13) which mutually join parts
of the side-edges (4, 5) of respective front and back

parts, so that the pants-type diaper will present a
waist opening (9) and two leg openings (10, 11),

wherein the pants-type diaper further comprises an
elongated absorbent pad comprising at least one

absorbent layer (14) having a front and a rear end-part
(17, 18) and an intermediate centre-part (19), an

inner casing layer (15) placed on that side of the
absorbent layer (14) which is intended to face towards

the wearer, and an outer casing layer (16) which is
placed on the other side of the absorbent layer (14),


characterized
 in that essentially the whole of the
respective front and/or back part (1, 2) is covered by

an elastically stretchable region (29, 30); in that
the crotch-part (3) is essentially non-stretchable in

relation to said stretchable region (29, 30); in that
at least one of respective end-parts (17, 18) of the

absorbent layer (14) is disposed within one of said
elastically stretchable regions (29, 30), while the

centre-part (19) of the absorbent layer is disposed
within the relatively non-stretchable crotch-part (3)

of the diaper, and that at least one of the
stretchable regions (29, 30) is disposed on the side
