 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR INHIBITING BONE LOSS CONTAINING 3 AND 4-SU STITUTED 2(5H)-FURAN0NES$ -f BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION5 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredients one or more 3- and 4-substituted 2(5H)- furanone compounds, and methods for administering such10 compositions to mammals, including humans, for the purpose of inhibiting bone loss. 2. Brief Description of the Prior ArtOsteoporosis is a disease which manifests itself in a decrease of bone density throughout the body. The15 descreased bone density is due to loss of calcium containing bone mineral and also due to loss of bone matrix (collagen) . The disease of osteoporosis usually afflicts elderly patients, more frequently post enopausal women, although beyond the age of 80 the20 frequency of the disease is about the same in men as in women. The cause of osteoporosis is not well understood, nevertheless it is believed that bone is continuously formed and resorbed during the life of a mammal, including human, and that in persons suffering25 from osteoporosis the rate of bone resorption is faster than the rate of bone formation, resulting in a net loss of bone density. Thus, osteoporosis is a disease 4. where the balance between bone production and r resorption, especially the balance of deposit and30 resorption of calcium in the bone, is disturbed.The present methods for treating osteoporosis include physical therapy, administration of anabolic agents, drugs containing phosphorous, vitamin D, 

calcium salts, fluoride salts calcitonin, and of the antibiotic mithramycin. In post-menopausal women < estrogen replacement therapy is also employed to prevent or lessen bone loss. - Among the foregoing, mithramycin is believed to decrease the rate of bone desorption, and thus modify the balance between bone production and resoption. The prior art which is believed to be closest to the present invention is United States Patent No. 4,916,241 describing certain 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone derivatives which are substituted in the 4 position with a substituted phenyl-methyl, substituted phenyl- hydroxymethyl, substituted phenyl alkyl, or with substituted phenyl-hydroxyalkyl groups, and which modify the balance between bone production and bone resorption in a host animal, including man.As further background to the present invention, it is noted that several types of 4-substituted 2(5H)- furanone derivatives, especially 4-substituted 5- hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone derivatives,
