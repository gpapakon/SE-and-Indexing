<ABSTRACT>
Three-way precious metal catalysts used for 
treatment of automobile exhaust gas or gas emissions from 

stationary combustion sources, are enhanced by using an 
oxygen-ion conducting material such as yttria-stabilized-zirconia 

(YSZ) as the support material. Support material 
surface area is 20-300 m²/gm, and useful concentrations of 

yttria on zirconia support are 1.0-50 wt.%. Useful 
concentrations of platinum or palladium on the support 

material is 0.01-2 wt.%, and the weight ratio of 
rhodium/platinum or rhodium/palladium is 0.01;0.1. YSZ-supported 

catalysts can achieve a substantially higher 
level of pollutants (CO, NO
x
, H₂ and hydrocarbons) 
removal, without requiring increased loading of expensive 

precious active metals on the support material. A 
further development enhances chemical activity and 

thermal stability by utilizing a composite oxygen-ion 
conducting support material composed of zirconia 

stabilized by yttria, calcia, magnesia or scandia, and at 
least 40 wt.% inert support material such as alumina or 

titania. The catalysts can be supported by composites of 
yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) and alumina, and contain 

0.01-3.0 wt.% total active metals, which may consist of 
major metals platinum or palladium and minor metals 

rhodium or ruthenium dispersed on the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a three-way supported 
catalyst for the treatment of gas emissions from mobile 
or stationary sources. A particular, though not 
exclusive, application of the invention is to treatment 
of gas emissions from fuel combustion sources. It will 
be shown how the invention may be employed for 
simultaneous oxidation of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and 
hydrocarbon compounds and reduction of nitrogen oxides 
present in gas emissions from mobile or stationary fuel 
combustion sources, such as automotive exhaust gases or 
power plant gas emissions. Supported metal catalysts are widely used for 
oxidation and reduction of pollutants present in gas 
exhausts or emissions from mobile or stationary internal 
combustion power generation sources. One approach to 
solving this gas emission problem by simultaneous 
oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and 
reduction of NOX compounds in exhaust gases is passing 
such gases through a single bed catalytic converter. The 
three-way catalyst used in the converter typically 
consists of platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh) and sometimes 
palladium (Pd) deposited on a conventional γ-alumina 
(Al₂O₃) support material, which may be in either pellet or 
a monolithic form. The existing precious metal catalysts for treatment 
of automotive exhaust gases typically uses alumina and 
sometimes ceria-stabilized γ-alumina or lanthanum oxide-stabilized 
γ-alumina as a support material. It is  
 
believed that the addition of ceria may promote the 
performance of the three-way catalyst by facilitating the 
water-gas shift reaction, by acting as an oxygen storage 
unit, and by stabilizing the gamma-alumina support 
against loss of surface area. But none of the known 
catalyst supports used for automobile exhaust gases 
treatment have provided any oxygen-ion conducting 
property. We have now found that use of an oxygen-ion 
conducting catalyst support material greatly improved the 
pollutant removal capability of previous metal catalysts 
without the need for increase in the catalyst active 
precious metal content, which makes the catalyst too 
costly. This invention enables us to provide a highly active 
three-way precious metal catalyst having an oxygen-ion 
conducting support material and which is useful for 
effective removal of pollutants present in combustion gas 
emissions from mobile and stationary fuel combustion 
sources, such as from automobile engine exhaust gases. 
A three-way catalyst is one that provides three material 
surfaces consisting of two
