<ABSTRACT>
New chemical compounds, derivatives of 9-aminoacridine of general formula (I) where R = H, CH₃; R¹ = H, CH₃, 
Br; R² = H, CH₃; R³ = alkyl-C₁-C₅, arylmethyl, diethylaminoethyl; X = C = O, CHOH; Y = CH₂; X + Y = CH = CH; 

and their salts with organic and non-organic acids. The desired compounds are obtained by interaction of substituted nitriles 
of antranyl acid with dimedone with subsequent cyclization of intermediate enaminonitriles into corresponding ketones of 9-aminoacridine 

after the reduction of which and of their derivatives alkylated or aralkylated on the 9-amino group, the 
corresponding alcohols are obtained, after hydration of which 9-amino-3,4-dihydroacridines are obtained. When 

experimented on animals, the said derivatives of 9-aminoacridine have shown psychotropic, antiamnestic and lipid 
regulating properties, as well as a lower toxicity in comparison with known preparations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The development refers to new chemical compounds, 
particulary to the derivatives of 9-aminoacridine, which 
show psychotropic, antiamnestic and lipid-regulative 
activity and may be used in medical practice to treat 
psychic diseases, in particular senile dementia of 
Alzheimer's type, as well as diseases connected with 
disturbances of lipid metabolism. The drug tacrine (Summers W.K. et all./New Engl. 
J. med. 1986, Vol. 315, No. 20, p. 1241) is widely used 
abroad in Alzheimers's disease clinics; a new original 
drug amiridine has been developed at National Research 
Center for Biologically Active Compounds (USSR Patent 
Application No. 4076765 from 01.07.86, A61K 31/47; USA 
Patent No. 4735953. cl. 514/313. 1988: BRD Patent 
No. 3231571, A61K 31/47, 1988). 
   The drawbacks of the above drugs are their comparatively 
high toxicity, side effects of cholinergic nature 
(tremor, diarrhea, salivation), and toxic effect of 
tacrine on liver. Derivatives of 9-aminoacridines having a general 
formula  with a structure similar to that of claimed compounds 
and possessing psychotropic and memory stimulative activity 
are known (European Patent Application 
No. 0179383 CO7D 219/10, -1985; Shutske g.m. et al.// 
J. Med. Chem. -1989, 32, 1805-1813; Shutske, g.m. et 
al.// J. Med. Chem. -1988, 31, 1279 - 1282). Shortcoming of these compounds is acomparatively 
high toxicity and as a consequence of this - a law 
therapeutic index. Structure analogues of claimed compounds having 
a formula are known (European Patent Application 
No. 0371388, CO7D 219/10, -1990).

which are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase; however, 
there is no information on their antiamnestic and 
lipid-regulative activity.  Derivatives of 9-aminoacridine represented by the 
formula 
where 
R= H, CH₃ R¹= H, CH₃, Br R²= H, CH₃ R³= alkyl-C₁ - C₅, arylmethyl, diethylaminoethyl X= C = O, CHOH, Y = CH₂ X + Y= CH = CH  
and their salts with organic and inorganic acids posessing 
psychotropic, antiamnestic and lipid-regulative 
activity are disclosed. The preparation of the compounds is performed 
following the scheme 
   The compounds having the formula V-VII are prepared 
by interaction of the corresponding substituted nitrile 
of aminoanthranilic acid I with dimedone II and subsequent 
cyclization of the hydrochloride of the substituted 
2- (5,5-dimethyl-3-oxocyclohex-1-enyl)amino benzonitrile 
III thus obtained in to substituted 9-amino-3,3-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroacridine-1(2H)-ones
