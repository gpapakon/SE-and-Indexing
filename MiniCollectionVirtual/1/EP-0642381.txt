<ABSTRACT>
A filter composite is made of a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a fabric. The PTFE and fabric are bonded by an adhesive. The adhesive is prevented from penetrating the fabric by employing a coating of an oil and water-repellent material to the surface of the fabric adjacent the adhesive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to membrane laminates useful as 
filters in filtration of solids from fluid streams as, for 
example, in industrial gas streams. Fabric filters are often used to separate solid particulate 
from an industrial fluid stream. As the textile based filter 
media accumulates particulate, its resistance to the flow of the 
fluid increases. When this resistance becomes significant, the 
filter must be rejuvenated by removing the particulate using one 
of several methods. The most common types of cleaning are pulse 
jet, reverse air, and shaker. The pulse jet technique uses a short duration pulse of 
compressed air. The blast of air is fired into the open top of 
the bag. The high speed air mass violently expands the filter. 
The bag then implodes against its cage and goes back into 
filtering service. During this rapid movement, the accumulated 
dust cake is released from the filter to fall into the hopper for 
removal. The reverse air systems employ a low flow of air from the 
clean side to the dust side. The entire compartment must be 
isolated from forward air flow during the cleaning period. the 
backwash of air collapses the bag. The fractured dust cake is 
flushed through the open bottom to the collection hopper. Shaker cleaning mechanisms are also used with filter bags that 
collect dust on the inside. The closed top of the bag is attached 
to an oscillating arm. The sinusoidal wave induced dislodges the 
dust cake in the bag which then falls through the open bottom to 
the hopper. The compartment of bags is removed from filtering 
service during this cleaning cycle. Shaker bag houses are used throughout the world in all sorts 
of industrial filtration applications. Applications range from 
the collection of powdered milk product, to the emissions control  
 
capture of fine dust from large furnaces in the metal refining 
industry. Most of these collectors use lightweight .13-.33 
Kg/m² (4-10 oz/yd²) woven filter medias. One of the primary modes of failure for these filters, when 
used in metals and minerals applications, is hydrolysis 
degradation from acids and moisture in the gas streams. Thus, 
woven polyacrylonitrile (PAN) materials can be used to improve 
chemical resistance. Conventional woven polyester and acrylic fabrics, are poor 
filter medias by themselves so a primary dust cake must be built 
up on the surface of the filtration media. The cake improves the 
efficiency of the filter as compared to a clean filter, but the 
cake also increases the pressure drop across the
