<ABSTRACT>
The proposed vehicle seat belt retractor is composed of a U-shaped casing having side walls 2, 3, between which there extends a retraction shaft 28 having locking wheels 31, 32 which are arranged on both sides and interact with a locking pawl 4, 6, 7. One end of the said shaft 28 is mounted in a spring drive which has a driving spring 38 and on its other end there is mounted a set of wheels having a control gearwheel 54 and a rotatable flywheel 60. This side of the casing is covered by a sensor cover 68 which encloses in its lower region a sensor system 18 which responds to sudden vehicle decelerations and, above the latter, supports a control collar 71 which is coaxial with the retractor shaft, in a rotatable manner to a limited extent. When the belt is suddenly extended, the flywheel 60, which remains behind the control gearwheel 54, reacts and effects, via a blocking pawl 56, rotation of the control collar 71, which brings the locking pawl 4, 6, 7 into engagement via a cam pocket 73. The sensor system 18 responds to sudden vehicle retardations and causes a control hook to engage in the control gearwheel 54, which causes the locking pawl 4, 6, 7 to be brought into engagement as well. The belt retractor consists of the following assemblies which are premounted separately and can be combined in a simple fashion: housing unit, sensor system, retractor shaft unit, set of wheels and sensor cover.
