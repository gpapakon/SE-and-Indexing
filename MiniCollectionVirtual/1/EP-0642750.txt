<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists in an annular structure which is 
suitable for making pieces of both real and cheap jewelry or 

the like, particularly rings. The annular structure of the 
invention is axially extensible in a telescopic manner. According 

to one preferred embodiment, this annular structure 
consists of a plurality of annular elements (1, 2), particularly 

two annular elements (1, 2) which are coaxially mounted 
the one inside the other, with the diameters of these annular 

elements being suitably reduced gradually with respect 
to each other, and each external annular element (1) being 

connected to the adjacent internal annular element (2) in 
such a manner that the former is shiftable relative to the 

latter, alternatively to a position in which the external 
annular element (1) is entirely or at least partly superposed 

on the internal annular element (2), and to a position in 
which this latter element (2) is entirely or at least partly 

exposed by the external annular element (1) coming to be axially 
set sideways of the internal annular element (2), so 

that the internal annular element is entirely or at least 
partly visible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an annular structure which is 
suitably applicable to various pieces of both real and cheap 
jewelry or the like, and particularly to rings. In the field of jewelry, to seek for novel and attractive 
features of jewels is, as known, an imperative need. 
Additionally, as matters presently stand, two contrary requisites 
are involved, that is, the desire of wearing a high 
value and then expensive jewel, and the need of being surely 
protected against theft or robbery, by avoiding to attract 
too much attention in public places. The object of the invention is to realize a jewel in 
form of an annular structure, particularly a ring, with a 
varying aesthetic appearance depending on a person's requirements, 
whereby it is possible to personalize and adapt a 
jewel to any circumstance in a rather inexpensive manner, so 
as to reconcile the aforementioned contrary requisites. This 
is achieved thanks to the provision of a simple and relatively 
low-cost construction, and without compromising or excessively  
 
limiting the aesthetic configuration of a jewel. These objects are attained with the provision of an annular 
structure, particularly a ring, which is axially extensible 
in a telescopic manner. The ring of the invention consists of a plurality of 
annular elements, particularly of two annular elements, 
which are each coaxially mounted the one inside the other, 
with the diameters thereof being suitably reduced gradually 
with respect to each other, and each external annular element 
being connected to the adjacent internal annular element 
in such a manner that the former is shiftable relative 
to the latter, alternatively to a position in which the external 
annular element is entirely or at least partly superposed 
on the internal annular element, and to a position in 
which this latter element is entirely or at least partly exposed 
by the external annular element coming to be axiallly 
set sideways of the internal annular element, so that the 
internal annular element is entirely or at least partly visible. The diameter of the internal annular element obviously 
corresponds to the diameter allowing the annular structure 
to be threaded on a finger of a person's hand. The means for reciprocally connecting the annular elements 
may be of any suitable type and should be suitable for 
effecting a relative coaxial shiftment to either of the above 
disclosed positions, simply by an axial translation or  
 
by a combined rotary and translatory movement of the external 
annular
