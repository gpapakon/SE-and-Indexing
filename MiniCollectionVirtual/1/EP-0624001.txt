<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver has a radio tuner (11) having a radio 
frequency input and an audio output (12), and an audio 

signal amplifying system having an audio input and an 
electroacoustical transducing output. A volume controller 

(15) is coupled to the radio tuner and the audio amplifying 
system. A microprocessor (32) is coupled to the tuner, 

volume controller (15), a visible display (38) and an array 
of controls (33). The microprocessor (32) is constructed 

and arranged to respond to actuation of the controls (33) 
to cause the tuner (11) to be tuned to a selected radio 

frequency, cause the display (38) to display the frequency 
to which the radio tuner (11) is tuned, cause the volume 

controller (15) to set the sound level from the 
electroacoustical transducing output and cause the display 

(38) to display a quantity representative of the volume to 
which the volume controller (15) is then set and further 

constructed and arranged to respond to actuation of the 

controls (33) to selectively couple the radio tuner audio 
output (12) to the audio input while initially setting the 

sound level to zero when the signal on the audio output 
(12) coupled to the audio input begins and gradually 

increasing the sound level to a predetermined value and 
reducing the sound level to zero when the signal on the 

audio output (12) then coupled to the audio input ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to radio receiving and more particularly concerns a novel alarm clock stereo radio receiver characterized by a number of advantageous features.GB-A-2259204 and US-A-4661994 disclose radio receivers having microprocessor controlled elements.According to the invention there is provided sound reproducing apparatus in accordance with claim 1.The auxiliary input receives sound signals from an external source, typically a CD player. Switching between the tuner (main input) and auxiliary input switches to the last volume level set in each mode, thereby allowing for differences in sensitivity.Another feature of the invention resides in using a combination of controls to preset the dimmed brightness in response to sensing the ambient light level.Another feature of the invention resides in a multifunction snooze and sleep control. If the alarm triggers in the receiver and/or alarm tone mode, tapping this control silences that sound for a predetermined snooze interval, typically 10 minutes. If the alarm triggers both alarm tone and receiver modes, tapping this control once silences the alarm tone for the snooze interval while leaving the receiver playing while tapping this control twice silences both for the snooze interval.The volume of receiver output and/or alarm tone ramps up when the alarm triggers or for normal turn-on. The ramp up is to the previous set level, the instantaneous level value being indicated on the visual display.Other features, objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when read in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the logical arrangement of a system according to the invention;FIG. 2 is a schematic circuit diagram of an exemplary embodiment of controls comprising control switches according to the invention;FIG. 3a-3j is a schematic circuit diagram of the main board in an exemplary embodiment of the invention;FIG. 4a-4d is a schematic circuit diagram of an equalizer board in an exemplary embodiment of the invention;FIG. 5a-5d is a schematic circuit diagram of a display board in an exemplary embodiment of the invention; andFIG. 6 is a perspective view of a clock stereo receiver embodying the invention.With reference now to the drawings and more particularly FIG. 1, there is a shown a diagram illustrating the logical arrangement of an alarm clock stereo receiver according to the invention. The receiver includes an AM/FM tuner 11 that
