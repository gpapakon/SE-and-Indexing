<ABSTRACT>
The liquid cargo transport ship according to the invention 
is complete with a double-hull structure comprising a side 

plating 2 and an internal plating 3 for constituting the 
bottom and side construction respectively surrounding cargo 

tanks 4 available for loading liquid cargo. Space domain 5 

formed between the side plating 2 and the internal plating 3 
is utilized for constituting a plurality of ballast tanks. 
A plurality of tanks 12R and 12L solely being available 
for ballasting purpose are provided in part of the interior of 

cargo tanks 4R and 4L which are disposed in the central domain 
of the ship 1 in the fore-and-aft direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid cargo transport 
ship such as a tanker at least comprising double-hull 
structure all over the bottom and side construction. Conventionally, structure of cargo tanks of any 
conventional liquid cargo tanker having known double-hull 
structure disposes a U-shaped internal hull plating inside of 
a U-shaped external side plating across a predetermined 
distance between them. Internal space generated by provision of the U-shaped 
internal hull plating in a tanker is made available for a 
plurality of cargo tanks for storing liquid cargo, whereas 
another U-shaped space domain between the internal and 
external hull platings is made available for a plurality of 
ballast tanks. Conventional cargo tanks formed inside of the U-shaped 
internal side plating of any conventional tanker are 
respectively sectioned into a center tank and wing tanks by a 
pair of longitudinal bulkheads. In addition, these cargo 
tanks are also sectioned into a plurality of tanks along cargo 
tank length fore and aft by means of a plurality of transverse  
 
bulkheads. In the same way, the above-cited conventional 
ballast tanks are also sectioned into a plurality of tanks 
along cargo tank length fore and aft by means of a plurality 
of transverse bulkheads. However, according to the above-cited conventional hull 
structure, in regard to the U-shaped space domain available 
for making up the above-cited ballast tanks, in order to 
secure absolute volume of ballast and absolute strength of the 
hull structure, normally, depth (width) provided for the 
bottom and side construction of the hull exceeds the actually 
required value. Furthermore, since any conventional tanker utilizes U-shaped 
space domain between the internal and external hull 
platings of the hull for making up ballast tanks, when the 
tanker is fully loaded with cargo, all the cargo tanks are 
filled with liquid cargo, thus causing extraordinary 
longitudinal bending moment to adversely affect the hull 
structure. This in turn necessitates shipbuilders to provide 
the hull structure with large-scale reinforcement. 
Furthermore, even when effectuating reinforcement, if the 
allowance against the reinforced hull strength were too short, 
then, degree of freedom for cargo loading will 
disadvantageously be constrained. Therefore, the object of the invention is to provide a  
 
novel transport ship (tanker) enabling shipbuilders to set 
depth (width) of an internal hull plating and a side plating 
of the hull structure to an
