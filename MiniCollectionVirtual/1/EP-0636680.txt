<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil for two-cycle 
engines. More specifically, it relates to a lubricating 
oil for two-cycle engines, by the use of which an engine can 
remarkably reduce smoke, remarkably improve starting performance, 
be kept clean, even at high or low temperature, enough to prevent 
its exhaust system from clogging with carbon, and have an 
excellent anti-seizure performance. Due to its lubricating mechanism, a two-cycle engine releases 
unburnt lubricating oil together with exhaust gas, which 
causes smoke. From the viewpoint of environmental pollution, it has been 
desired to reduce smoke as much as possible. In Japan, there has 
already been extensively marketed low-smoke types of lubricating 
oil for two-cycle engines whose base oil contains polybutene or 
polyisobutylene as a major component that generates smoke less 
than mineral oils. However, since polybutene accelerates friction between a 
piston and a cylinder due to its viscosity(stickiness), it inevitably 
reduces engine power more than mineral oils. Furthermore,  
 
starting becomes hard or troublesome when such a type of oil is 
applied in motors whose capacity is too small to start with a 
starter motor, or recoil types of engine such as a lawn-mower 
engine started by winding and then pulling a string around a 
crank pulley, a chain saw or a generator. Polybutene has been considered to cause clogging with carbon 
in an exhaust system less frequently than mineral oils. It, 
however, has been reported that polybutene produces more emulsion 
sludge at low temperature than mineral oils when used in 
particular two-cycle engines, for example, an engine of a motorcycle 
used for newspaper delivery which is exposed to frequent 
repetition of start-and-stop. Clogging of an exhaust system with 
carbon or emulsion causes deterioration of combustion performance 
of an engine, which leads to reduction of engine power. Therefore, it has been desired to develop a lubricating oil 
for two-cycle engines which can maintain their cleanliness to 
minimize power reduction, deterioration of starting performance 
and carbon clogging of their exhaust system. As the result of extensive researches to develop a lubricating 
oil suitable for two-cycle engines, the present inventors 
have found that a lubricating oil whose base oil is a polyalkylene 
glycol derivative with a particular structure is much more 
preferable with regard to engine power, starting performance and 
reduction of carbon clogging of an exhaust system than
