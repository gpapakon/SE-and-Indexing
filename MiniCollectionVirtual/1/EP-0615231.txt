<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing magnetic metal particles suitable for magnetic 
recording mediums. In recent years, magnetic recording mediums have 
been more increasingly required to be improved so as to have 
higher recording density and higher performance. As 
associated with such a trend, an increasing interest has 
been directed to iron or iron-based magnetic metal particles 
(referred to as magnetic metal particles hereunder) having 
higher saturation magnetization and higher coercive force 
than those of acicular magnetite and maghemite, even 
compared with those of cobalt modified magnetic iron oxides 
of the magnetite and maghemite, as magnetic particles to be 
used in magnetic recording mediums. The magnetic metal 
particles have greater promise for use in higher performance 
magnetic recording mediums such as high image quality video 
tapes for HDTV in recent years and high recording density 
disks as well as for practical use in digital audio tapes 
and 8 mm video tapes. There has been recently a need for fine magnetic  
 
metal particles useful for high performance magnetic 
recording mediums in the acicular form of uniform size 
normally having a largest dimension of about 0.3 µ m, or 
even no larger than 0.2 µ m which do not contain any 
sintered agglomerates and which are more excellent in 
dispersibility in magnetic paint systems, orientability and 
filling property in magnetic coating films with the paint 
systems, and flatness of the coatings. Above all, for the 
purpose of providing a recording medium having a higher 
output level with a reduction in the noise level 
attributable to particle size, further ultra-fine particles 
have been required so that an increasing attention has been 
directed to acicular magnetic metal particles of smaller 
size having excellent magnetic properties and aging 
stability. Magnetic metal particles have been produced 
generally by a method where hydrated iron oxides of the 
acicular form such as goethite are dehydrated under heat to 
produce iron oxide particles such as hematite which are 
reduced under heat in a reducing gaseous atmosphere such as 
hydrogen to produce magnetic metal particles. However, the 
thermal process, especially the reduction step, tends to 
cause sintering of particles and deformation of particle 
shape. Such deformation of particle shape and the 
coarsening of α -Fe crystalline particles impair 
significantly magnetic characteristics of the end magnetic 
metal particles. This has an influence on the
