 TITLEMULTILAYER LAMINATES FROM BLOW MOLDABLE THERMOPLASTIC POLYAMIDE AND POLYVINYL ALCOHOL RESINS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to laminates formed from at least two layers. The first layer is a flexible blow moldable thermoplastic polyamide composition, and the second layer is a polyvinyl alcohol or copolymer of vinyl alcohol. Also disclosed is a process for making such laminates. In addition, articles made from such laminates, such as fuel tanks for motor vehicles, are disclosed; such laminates exhibit resistance to permeation of fuel compositions and have good high and low temperature mechanical properties.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns novel laminates which can withstand high temperatures for extended periods of time, possess good low temperature impact strength, and have good resistance to permeation of fuel compositions, especially in automotive applications. The laminates disclosed in the present application contain at least two layers. One layer is a blow moldable thermoplastic polyamide composition, and the second layer is a polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) or copolymer of vinyl alcohol.Processes for preparing a blow moldable thermoplastic polyamide composition are known in the art. In addition, multi-layer articles of at least a permeation barrier resin, namely the PVOH or copolymer of vinyl alcohol, hereinafter referred to as vinyl alcohol compositions, and at least a polyolefin are also known. However, no art exists which discloses a multi-layer laminate of a vinyl alcohol composition and a thermoplastic blow moldable polyamide composition.In addition, there is no prior art on laminates comprising at least one layer of a blow moldable thermoplastic polyamide composition which have good high temperature tensile properties, low temperature impact strength and good fuel permeation resistance. However, U.S. Patents 4,243,724 and 4,243,074 disclose laminates made from at least two layers comprising a polyamide compound and a polyamide/polyvinyl 

alcohol. These references do not teach the use of a blow moldable thermoplastic polyamide or the use of at least one layer being a vinyl alcohol or copolymers of vinyl alcohol which are not further melt blended with a second polyamide. Moreover, the present application discloses laminates which can be made into large containers, in particular, fuel tanks. In order to blow mold such large containers, excellent melt strength is required. Thus, the laminates disclosed in the present application incorporate a fibrillatable

8. The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the vinyl alcohol composition is a copolymer of ethylene vinyl alcohol. 


 9. The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the first layer comprises 0.1-0.6 weight percent fibrillatable fluoropolymer.
10. The laminate of Claim 9 wherein the fluoropolymer is fibrillstable polytetrafluoroethylene. 11. The laminate of Claim 1 wherein the polyvinyl alcohol is at least about 95 percent saponified.
12. The laminate of Claim 11 wherein the polyvinyl alcohol is at least about 99 percent saponified.
13. Articles made from the laminate of Claim 1. 14. Articles made from the laminate of Claim 9.
15. The laminar article of Claim 13 in the form of a container.
16. The laminar article of Claim 14 in the form of a fuel tank for motor vehicles.
17. A process for preparing a laminated article comprising the steps of i) melting a flexible thermoplastic blow moldable polyamide composition in a first extruder, and concurrently ii) melting a vinyl alcohol composition in a second extruder iii) transporting the polyamide composition and the vinyl alcohol composition from a feed block into a die; iv) exiting the thermoplastic polyamide composition and the vinyl alcohol composition as coextruded layers from a die slot.
