<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet head (12) includes a substrate on which a 
plurality of energy generating elements (1103) for generating 

energy utilized to discharge ink are provided, and a wall 
member joined to the substrate (103). The wall member has a 

plurality of flow passage walls (1109) which partially define flow 
passages (1108), and the energy generated by the energy generating 

element (1103) acts through the flow passage (1108) so as to act on the 
ink to discharge the ink. The flow passages (1108) are fully 

defined when the substrate (103) is joined to the wall member. A 
recessed portion provided in the substrate of the ink jet 

head (12) is positioned between adjoining energy generating 
elements. The recessed portion has a bottom surface 

located at a position which is lower than a position for a 
heat acting surface of the substrate (103) along which heat is 

transmitted to the ink. The flow passage walls (1109) of the wall 
member abut the substrate at the bottom surface. 

Consequently, any pressure wave generated by the energy 
generating element (1103) is not released to an adjacent flow 

passage, and crosstalk between the adjoining flow passages (1108) 
can be prevented. As a result, an ink jet head exhibiting 

excellent printing quality can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet head and
an ink jet head apparatus having the ink jet head.
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method of
and an apparatus for manufacturing the ink jet head, and
more particularly, to the alignment in manufacture of
energy generating elements employed for discharge in the
head.Figs. 1 and 2 show an example of a conventional ink
jet head. Fig. 1 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view
partially showing a surface of a head which is cut
horizontally along a discharge port row. Fig. 2 is a
cross-section taken along the line 2-2' of Fig. 1.As shown in Fig. 1, a plurality of discharge ports
1101 are provided in a conventional ink jet head. An
electro-thermal transducer 1103 for generating thermal energy
utilized to discharge a liquid (hereinafter referred to as
an ink) from the discharge port 1101 is provided for every
ink flow passage 1108. Each of the electro-thermal 
transducers 1103 is mainly constituted by a heating
resistor 1102 and electrode interconnections 1110 for
supplying power to the heating resistor 1102.More specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, an insulator
film 1111 and an interlayer film 1112 are formed on a
substrate 103 made of, for example, silicon, and a heating
resistor layer 1102 having a pattern such as that shown in
Fig. 1 is formed on these films. Patterned electrode
interconnections 1110 made of, for example, Al are formed
on a portion of the heating resistor layer 1102. The
portion of the heating resistor layer 1102 on which no
electrode interconnections are formed constitutes a heating
portion 1116.Furthermore, a first protective film 1113 and a second
protective film 1114 are coated on the patterned heating
resistor layer 1102 and the electrode interconnection 1110.
A heater board 104 (see Fig. 2) is constituted by the
substrate 103, the electro-thermal transducers formed on
the substrate 103 and so on.Referring to Fig. 1, the ink flow passages 1108 are
partitioned by flow passage walls 1109. The end portions
of the ink flow passages 1108 remote from the discharge
ports 1101 communicate with a common liquid chamber 1106.
The common liquid chamber 1106 stores the ink supplied from
an ink tank (not shown). The ink supplied from the common 
liquid chamber 1106 is introduced to each of the ink flow
passages 1108 where it is retained by virtue of the
meniscus formed near the discharge port 1101. At that
time, if the electro-thermal transducer 1103 is selectively
driven, film boiling occurs in the ink as a result of the
thermal
