<ABSTRACT>
In order that a plate clamping device is suitable for automatic plate exchange and has only one narrow clamping gap, a clamping bar (17) is arranged resiliently in the cylinder groove (18), which clamping bar has resilient clamping bodies (21) in the clamping direction and at whose ends radial forces can be applied by means of actuating devices.

Device for securing a flexible printing plate (22)
on the forme cylinder (16) of a printing machine having

at least one cylinder groove (18), extending in the
axial direction, one edge of which carries the leading

plate arm, this edge being formed with a groove wall
tapering at an acute angle towards the cylinder casing

surface, and with a further groove wall (4) disposed
approximately perpendicularly to the cylinder casing

and a clamping body (21) co-operating with the groove
walls (3, 4) with clamping surfaces (6, 7), this body

being arranged on a clamping bar (17, 37, 49) supported
resiliently in the bottom of the cylinder groove (18),

characterised in that the clamping body (21) is held
movably in the clamping bar (17, 37, 49) in the

clamping direction, is supported resiliently on it, and
can be moved out to a stop, and the clamping bar (17,

37, 49) extends more or less to the ends of the
cylinder casing and can be acted on there by means of

actuation devices (32, 33, 39, 53) with forces directed
radially on to the forme cylinder (16, 36, 50).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the clamping body (21) is held in a groove (24) of the

clamping bar (17) and is resiliently supported in its
base, sleeves (27) are screwed to its lower side with

an intermediate stop washer (29), each sleeve (27)
being pushed through a bore (28) of the clamping bar

(17), the stop washer (29) covering this bore.
Device according to claim 1 or 3, characterised in
that the clamping body is composed of clamping pieces

(21) arranged adjacently to each other.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that in the end region of the clamping

bar (17) on each machine side wall (30, 31) there is
arranged a rod (32, 33) which can be moved in the

radial direction through a bore (34, 35) of the
cylinder casing of the forme cylinder (16) onto the

clamping bar (17).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that in the end region of the clamping

bar (49) on one machine side wall (52) there is
arranged a rod (53) which can be moved out in the axial

direction of the forme cylinder (50) and carries an
inclined plane (54) which co-operates with an inclined

plane (51) of the clamping bar (49).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that in the end region of the clamping

bar (37) there is arranged a pressure chamber (39) with
a diaphragm (40) which can be deflected radially onto

the clamping bar (37), and the pressure chamber (39)
has a connecting bore (41, 45) onto which the

connecting shoe (43, 48) of a compressed air source can
be placed.
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that
the connecting bore (41) opens within the casing of the

forme cylinder (36), and the connecting shoe (43) has a
connecting aperture (44) in the form of a slot which is

enclosed by a sealing surface having the curvature of
the cylinder casing.
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that
the connecting bore (45) opens in the end face of the

forme cylinder (46), and the connecting shoe (48) has a
connecting aperture (47) in the form of a circular

segment which is enclosed by a flat sealing surface.
