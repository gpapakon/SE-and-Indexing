<ABSTRACT>
There is an annular network structure with several rings of distance regions and a sector division, the number of which corresponds to the number of cells located around a ring. In the centre there is a base station with higher aerials (3) to beam towards all the cells or for reception from the individual cells. The aerials take the form of strongly focusing directional aerials supplying at least two cells in the same sector radially from the aerial position with the same frequency.

<CLAIMS>
Mobile radio network having a number of base 
stations in mutual spatial arrangement in the manner of 

a cellular system, in which there is provided a ring-shaped 
structure having cell rings positioned around the 

centre, as well as a central base station in the centre 
with antennae (3) installed at a raised location which 

are designed as strongly focussing directional antennae, 
characterized by a subdivision of the ring-shaped structure 

into sectors in accordance with the number of cells 
within each cell ring, with different frequencies in 

adjacent sectors, and by an illumination of all the 
cells, or the reception from the individual cells, 

respectively, by the central base station with the 
antennae (3) in such a manner that at least two cells 

lying in radial direction from the antenna location 
within the same sector are supplied with the same 

frequency in each case. 
Mobile radio network according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the number of cells within a sector 

lying between cells having the same frequency is variable. 
Mobile radio network according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a flexible cell structure is 

produced by combining adjacent cells of the same or 
adjacent sectors to form a new cell.
