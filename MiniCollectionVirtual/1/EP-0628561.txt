<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 
cephalosporin compounds useful as antibiotics. More specifically, 
the present invention relates to a novel process for 
preparing cephem derivatives represented by the following general 
formula (I) having 2-[aminothia(dia)zolyl]-2-methoxyiminoacetamido 
group on the 7-position of cephem nucleus, characterized in 
that a reactive thiophosphate of thia(dia)zole acetic acid having 
the following general formula (II) (hereinafter referred as to 
"the reactive organic acid derivative") is acylated with an 7-ACA 
(7-aminocephalosporanic acid) derivative : 
 
in which 
R1represents a carboxy group or a protected carboxy group 
which can form the salt of -COO-M+ with an alkali metal ion 
(M+) such as sodium, or may represent -COO- when R2 has a 
substituent having positive electric charge such as pyridinium, 
pyrimidinium or thiazolium, R2represents hydrogen, acyloxymethyl, heterocyclic methyl or 
heterocyclic thiomethyl, each of which can be substituted 
with appropriate substituents, R3represents hydrogen or an amino-protecting group, R4represents C1-C4 alkyl or phenyl, or together with the 
oxygen or phosphorus atom to which it is attached may form a 
5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring, and Qrepresents N or CH. In general, numerous methods for preparing β-lactam antibiotics 
have been disclosed in prior publications and patent specifications. 
Such prior methods prepare the β-lactam antibiotic 
compounds commonly starting from an organic acid represented by  
 
the following general formula (A) which is converted into a 
reactive derivative thereof and then subjected to the acylation 
reaction with an amino group of the β-lactam nucleus : 
 
wherein R3 and Q are defined as previously described. The reactive derivatives which have been known from the 
above prior methods include an acid chloride, a reactive ester, a 
reactive amide, a mixed acid anhydride and the like. However, 
the reactive derivative in the form of an acid chloride or a 
mixed acid anhydride is prepared under a stringent reaction 
condition and further is unstable so that it might be used in 
situ for the acylation reaction without isolation. This may be 
the major reason for the formation of by-products. In adiition, 
the reactive ester and the reactive amide have also disadvantages 
in that they are preared in a low yield, their reactivity is very 
low to require the long reaction time, and further the reaction 
by-products, for example, a hydroxy derivative such as
