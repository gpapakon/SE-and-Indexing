<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for 
detecting irregular portions of an optical fiber 

which arise due to microscopic bubbles, defects, and 
the like during an optical fiber drawing process. 

The present process operates by varying the 
pulling rate of a pulling capstan based on feeding 

back measurements of the external diameter of the 
optical fiber to the pulling capstan. The ratio of 

a given pulling rate variation to a predetermined 
time period is then computed. The computed ratio is 

then compared to a previously specified value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method 
and an apparatus for detecting irregularities in an 
optical fiber, especially during a drawing process 
for forming the optical fiber. It is known to employ a control method in 
which variations in the external diameter of the 
optical fiber are fed back to a pulling capstan. 
Figure 3 (Prior Art) is a schematic diagram of a 
conventional drawing apparatus utilizing such a 
control method. An optical fiber preform 1 is 
melted in a heating furnace 2, pulled by a capstan 
4, and formed into an optical fiber 3. The external 
diameter of the optical fiber 3 is measured by an 
external diameter measuring instrument 5 which is 
located just downstream of the heating furnace 2. 
Thereafter, the optical fiber 3 is coated with a 
resin by a coating unit 6, pulled through a resin 
curing furnace 7, and then wound on a drum 8. The external diameter measurements from the 
external diameter measuring instrument 5 are fed 
back to the control system of the pulling rate of 
the pulling capstan 4 so that the optical fiber has 
a consistent, predetermined external diameter 
(normally 125 Âµm). When the external diameter of the optical 
fiber varies due the presence of contaminants, such 
as microscopic particulate matter, the variation in 
external diameter is detected by the external 
diameter measuring instrument 5. That is because  
 
the feedback system described above cannot 
compensate for such a discrete variation. However, if bubbles or the like remain in 
the optical fiber preform over some length as it is 
drawn, the pulling rate of the pulling capstan 4 is 
suitably altered to maintain a consistent external 
diameter of the optical fiber 3. Accordingly, the 
external diameter measuring instrument 5 cannot 
detect irregular portions of the optical fiber 3. 
However, the bubbles may collapse when the optical 
fiber is drawn, even though the external diameter is 
controlled. Consequently, the core of the optical 
fiber deforms and causes increased transmission 
loss. Therefore, such deformed portions of the 
optical fiber must be detected in order to be 
removed.  
 Document JP-A-52-154 644 discloses an optical fibre 
manufacturing device containing a filament diameter detector 
being operated with scattered light caused by constitutional 
imperfectness of the fibre. The signal of the detector is 
compared with a reference value corresponding to a desired 
filament diameter for controlling the drum speed so that a 
uniform filament diameter may be manufactured.
