<ABSTRACT>
An image output system including an image printer 53 for printing images on 
a lenticular lens sheet 16 and a computer for controlling the image printer 53, 

while a plurality of images are being superimposition printed on the lenticular lens 
sheet 16, by making the size (W) and the feed (S) for each pixel smaller in the first 

direction so as to superimpose pixels when printing, or by narrowing the shape of 
each pixel in this first direction and then reducing the feed for each pixel by the 

portion by which each of the pixels have been narrowed. It is possible to make the 
mumber of pixels per unit length of the first direction large.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image output apparatus, and more 
particularly to an image output apparatus for outputting a three-dimensional 
image. A method known as the multi-view three-dimensional picture display 
method is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3895867 in which pictures are taken with a 
camera using a photographic film which will accept a plurality of images which 
are shifted with respect to each other only by the parallax in perspective between a 
pair of views. The negative imprinted on this film is then used to make a combined 
image by going from a plurality of points via this lenticular lens. This image is 
then printed. If this printed image is then viewed via the same lenticular lens, an 
image which appears to be three-dimensional can then be viewed without the aid 
of glasses. Also, a method for obtaining a three-dimensional image has been proposed in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 2-87792 in which a plurality of 
television images picked up by using a plurality of television cameras are 
synthesized and displayed on a display of the television set and the synthesized 
image is observed through a lenticular lens provided on the display field surface. Furthermore, a method is put forward where an item such as a lenticular lens 
made up from a large number of rows of semi- cylindrical lenses is used. When a 
large number of images arranged along a first direction are then viewed, only one 
of these images is selected to be expanded from its compressed size for viewing so 
that a three-dimensional visual effect results. This kind of display method is put 
forward in, for example, in Television Association Magazine Vol. 45, No. 11, 
pp1472 to 1474 (1991) entitled 50-inch multi-vision three-dimensional television 
without glasses. In the image arrangement for carrying out the aforementioned display method, 
for example, n cameras are used to pick up images of the target (object) from 
different perspectives. When each of the images obtained by these n cameras are 
composed, n pixels will correspond to one pitch p (the width of the lens taken 
along the direction at right angles to the generating line for a single semi-cylindrical 
lens) of the lenticular lens, and just one of these n pixels will  
 
correspond to each of the n cameras. As only one of the n pixels within a single 
pitch p will correspond to one of the n cameras, (n-1) of the frames taken by each 
camera can be discarded, i.e. (n-1) pixels are cancelled out. By arranging the pixels and projecting the
