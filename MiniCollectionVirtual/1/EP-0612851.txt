<ABSTRACT>
In situ
 hybridization methods for assessing, determining or observing the RNA produced 
by transcriptionally active genes. In one embodiment, the methods allow simultaneous 

observation of the gene and its transcripts in a spatially correlated manner. As the 
in situ
 
hybridization methods have established their ability to maintain the targeted mRNA at the site of 

its transcription, it can be determined which genes are being expressed and the level of expression 
can be quantitated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for in situ hybridization and in particular to 
methods of insitu hybridization for evalluating the spatial organization of transcription, the 
transcriptional activity of specific genes and the distribution and processing of specific mRNAs in 
intact cells. The site of RNA processing and the spatial relationship between RNA processing and 
transcription in mammalian nuclei have not previously been established and there has been a long-standing 
interest in determining these parameters within the cell nucleus. There is evidence for 
and against the cotranscriptional splicing of precursor mRNAs. A. L. Beyer and Y. N. Osheim 
(Semm. Cell Biol, 2, 131 (1991)) have shown that nascent transcripts in Drosophila are 
associated with spliceosomes, and in some cases, the spliceosome and nascent transcripts can be 
directly visualized by electron microscopy. In contrast, J. R. Nevins (Annu.Rev. Biochem. 52, 
441 (1983)) and others have shown that the unspliced transcripts in mammalian cells can be 
isolated in the poly(A) fraction, indicating that splicing is posttranscriptional. Previous studies attempting to determine whether or not mRNA transcripts in mammalian 
cells are localized at the site of transcription or are free to diffuse within the nucleus after 
synthesis are contradictory. Those studies which have reported localized foci of RNAs have been 
unable to establish the significance of these localizations. Highly localized nuclear "tracks" of  
 
specific viral mRNAs have been observed by fluorescence microscopy in chromatin-depleted 
nuclear matrix extracts (J. B. Lawrence. R. H. Singer and L. M. Marselle. Cell 57,493 (1989); 
Y. Xing and J. B. Lawrence. J. Cell Biol. 112, 1055 (1991)). Several viral RNAs have been 
observed to localize at only one or two sites within the nucleus (J. B. Lawrence. et al. (1989), 
supra: J. B. Lawrence, L. M. Marselle. K. S. Byron, J. L. Sullivan and R. H. Singer. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 87, 5420 (1990); A. Raap, et al. Exp. Cell Res. 197, 319 (1991)), but this 
observation is in contrast to microinjected globin RNA which appears to diffuse within the 
nucleus. Lawrence, et al, (1990) speculate that these tracks might represent sites of transcription, 
but cannot rule out other functions due to the hybridization protocols used. 
Although these 
studies demonstrated foci of RNA in the cell, their function could not be determined, e.g., 
whether they represented sites of transcription, sites of RNA processing, sites of RNA

An in situ hybridization method for detecting a specific mRNA in spatial correlation with a 
corresponding gene, the method comprising: 


a) hybridizing nuclear RNA to an mRNA-specific nucleotide probe under conditions 
in which DNA is not denatured the probe being tagged with a detectable label; 
b) generating a signal from the detectable label, and; 
c) detecting the signal as a focus or track of fluorescence as an indication of the 
spatial correlation of the mRNA to the gene. 
An in situ hybridization method for detecting a specific mRNA in spatial correlation with a 
corresponding gene, the method comprising: 


a) hybridizing nuclear RNA to an mRNA-specific nucleotide probe tagged with a first 
detectable label under conditions in which the DNA is not denatured; 
b) generating a first signal from the first detectable label; 
c) fixing the cell such that the first signal is maintained at the site of transcription of 
the mRNA in the form of a focus or track of fluorescence; 
d) hybridizing the gene to a DNA-specific nucleotide tagged with a second detectable 
label under DNA-denaturing conditions; 
e) generating a second signal from the second detectable label, and; 
f) detecting the first and second signals as an indication of the spatial correlation of 
the mRNA to the gene.
