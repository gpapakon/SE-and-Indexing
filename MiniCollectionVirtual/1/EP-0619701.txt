<ABSTRACT>
A device for cultivating and harvesting growths (2, 41) is disclosed where the growths (2, 41) are cultivated in sectioned and/or flexible channels (1) which, when harvesting the growths (2, 41) are led, by using a vehicle (4), past working stations (6) associated with the vehicle (4), where the channels (1) are conveyed and elevated from the ground and relowered approximately to their starting position in conveying devices (3) running along the vehicle (4). The system is especially suited for harvesting strawberries.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device and a method for 
cultivating, growing and harvesting vegetables and berries, 
as well as growths growing in a similar fashion as the ones 
mentioned above. Previously, when harvesting vegetables and berries the 
harvester, during the entire time of the picking and 
harvesting has been forced to bend over or kneel to be able 
to perform the picking or harvesting. This has in many cases 
caused exhaustion damages, bad knees, back and neck as well 
as a poor speed during the harvesting because the working 
positions are tiresome in themselves. Additionally, in bad 
weather the harvesting has not been pleasant at all, because 
it is impossible to place entire fields under a roof, and 
it is also necessary for the plants to receive rain and 
precipitation to be able to grow. There has, at least to alleviate the position of the body 
when harvesting, been proposed different kinds of solutions, 
everything from movable devices where the harvester lies on 
a platform mounted on caterpillars and directs the device 
with his legs, to simply bringing along a camping chair into 
the field, but all these solutions suffer from being either 
too impractical or also being equally cumbersome as picking 
berries without any aiding devices at all. Further, from GB-A-1 587 550 it is known to grow plants, 
such as strawberries, in elongated channel-shaped plant 
growth containers. The purpose of the present invention is to avoid all the 
above mentioned disadvantages and at the same time as well 
as additionally, to produce an improved system for cultivation 
of the plants before the harvest. This is achieved by means of a system according to claim 1.  
 The plants which are to be harvested are cultivated in 
channels. In a preferred embodiment, during the harvest 
these channels are placed on 
rails or conveyor belts running on one or both sides of a 
locomotive vehicle, e.g. a tractor. The rails or conveyor  
 
belts lead the channels including the plants rearwards 
towards a platform, e.g. a trailer with a platform, where 
there is a number of people harvesting the vegetables or 
berries. The channels with the plants run preferably over a 
table on the platform of the trailer, and are then again led 
downwards on the backside of the platform, e.g. in the same 
way they were placed before the harvesting started. It is 
preferred that the platform is equipped with a roof and that 
the persons harvesting the vegetables or berries are located 
at both sides of the channels passing

<CLAIMS>
System for industrial harvesting of growths (2,41) 
comprising at least one channel (1) and a vehicle (4,5), the 

channel (1) containing a growth medium (40) for the growths 
(2,41), and the vehicle (4,5) comprising leading devices 

(3,11) and work stations (6,7), the channel (1) being able 
to be moved along leading devices (3,11) on the vehicle 

(4,5) so that it moves past work stations (6,7) for harvesting 
the growths. 
System according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the channels (1) are 
sectioned. 
System according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that the channels (1) comprise 
a soft material, preferably a plastic material. 
System according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that the channels (1) comprise 
a rigid material, preferably a plastic material. 
System according to claim 1,
characterized in
 that the vehicle (4,5) 
comprises a platform (5), e.g. a trailer or a carrier, 

whereupon said working stations (6,7) are located. 
System according to claim 1 or 5,
characterized in
 that the working stations 
(6,7) are located on each side of the leading devices 

(3,11) for the channels (1) on the platform (5). 
System according to any of the claims 1 - 6,
characterized in
 that the channel (1) is 
continuous.  

 
System according to any of the claims 1 - 6,
characterized in
 that the channel (1) is 
segmented. 
System according to any of the claims 1 - 8,
characterized in
 that the channel (1) also 
comprises at least one heating cable (43). 
System according to any of the claims 1 - 9,
characterized in
 that the channel (1) 
additionally comprises at least one cable for supplying 

fluid. 
System according to any of the claims 1 - 10,
characterized in
 that the channel (1) has a 
square cross section with heating cables (43) located by at 

least one edge of the square cross section, and optionally 
additionally is equipped with a hose (42) for supplying a 

fluid, located along the center line of the channel (1). 
System according to claim 11,
characterized in
 that the growth medium (40) 
is polyurethane foam. 
Use of a system according to any of the preceeding 
claims for cultivating and harvesting strawberries comprising 

the steps of: 

cultivating the strawberries in the channel (1); 
placing the channel on the conveyor means on the 
vehicle (4,5); 
leading the channel (1) rearwards to the work stations 
(6,7), and 
harvesting the strawberries at the work stations 
(6,7).
