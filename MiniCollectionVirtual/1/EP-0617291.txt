<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for accurately detecting a frequency of an
AC electric parameter of an electric power system.In an electric power system including electric
power plants for generating power, transfer plants, such
as transmission lines and substations, for transferring
the power generated by the electric power plants, and
demand plants which consume the power transferred and
distributed by the transfer plants, when a generator of
an electric power plants is stopped, since power
supplied to the electric power system is reduced, loads
on functioning generators are increased and the rotation
rates of the generators are lowered. In contrast, when
a load, i.e., a demand plant, is eliminated, since power
is oversupplied to the electric power system, the
generators of the electric power plants are accelerated
and the frequency of the electric power system is
increased.An electric power system is most stabilized, when
the frequency thereof corresponds to a fundamental
frequency. Therefore, in order that the electric power
system is operated stably, it is necessary to detect,
with high accuracy, how much the frequency of the
electric power system is deviated from the fundamental
frequency. Further, in controlling excitation of a
generator, it is necessary to detect a frequency in 
a wide range at high speed.In consideration of the aforementioned technical
background, a method for detecting how much the
frequency of the electric power system is deviated from
the fundamental frequency, using the following
algorithm, is proposed.
Vm-3·Vm-12-Vm·Vm-15Vm-32-Vm·Vm-6∝sin (2πε)cos (πε/2)In the above formula, "m" represents a sampling
time series and a sampling frequency is 12 times the
fundamental frequency of an AC electric parameter of the
electric power system. Thus, the time series (m-3)
means data which is 1/4 cycle late for the time series m.
"ε" represents a relative error with respect to the
fundamental frequency of 1. The relative error "ε" is
obtained by the following equation:
ε = Δf/fo = Δ ω/ωo
,
where the fundamental frequency of the electric power
system is fo (ωo) and a deviation from the fundamental
frequency fo (ωo) is Δf(f-f0).However, as clear from FIG. 8 showing a frequency
characteristic, the linearity of the frequency
characteristic is decreased and a calculation error
respect to a left side of the formula (1a) is increase,
in accordance with the increase of the relative error ε
(quadrature axis), i.e., the deviation between the
frequency f of the electric
