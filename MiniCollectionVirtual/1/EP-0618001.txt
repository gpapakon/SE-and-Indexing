<ABSTRACT>
New process for the preparation of spherules of one or a number of alimentary or medicinal active principles where, in a first step, spherules are formed by controlled division of a primary emulsion of oil in water in a water-immiscible solvent and then, in a second step, the spherules obtained are separated off.

Process for the preparation of spherules of one 
or more alimentary or medicinally active principles, 

characterized in that in a first step spherules are 
formed by controlled division of a primary oil-in-water 

emulsion consisting of an alimentary or medicinal charge, 
oil, a protein and water in a water-immiscible solvent, 

and in a second step the spherules obtained are then 
separated. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the alimentary charge contains vitamins chosen from 

vitamins A, E, D

. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the protein is gelatin. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the oil is chosen from vitamin A, vitamin E or 

rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower or cod liver oil. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the emulsion additionally contains an antioxidant 

agent chosen from 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene, 
6-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroxy-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline 

and 2-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydroxytoluene. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the emulsion additionally contains a surface-active 

agent chosen from dilauryl thiodipropionate, an alkali-metal 
or alkaline-earth metal stearate, sodium or calcium 

2-stearoyllactate or carboxymethylcellulose. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the solvent is chosen from aliphatic solvents  

 
containing 4 to 8 carbon atoms. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the primary emulsion is formed by 

mixing an oily solution based on or containing one or 
more active principles and optionally one or more 

antioxidizing agents and an aqueous solution containing 
the protein, and optionally one or more surface-active 

agents. 
Process according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the primary emulsion is formed by mixing from 

approximately 10 to 30 % by weight of the oily solution 
and from 70 to 90 % by weight of the aqueous solution. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that before separation of the 

spherules is performed a crosslinking step is carried 
out. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in 
that the crosslinking agent is chosen from acetaldehyde, 

glutaraldehyde and glyoxal. 
Process according to claim 11, characterized in 
that the crosslinking agent consists of an aqueous 

solution containing 5 to 20 % by weight of crosslinking 
agent or the pure product. 
Process for the preparation of spherules having 
a diameter between 100 µm to 500 µm according to any one 

of the preceding claims, characterized in that they are 
formed by introduction into a static mixer or into a 

stirred mixer of the emulsion containing the active 
principle(s), the protein, water and a water-immiscible 

solvent.
