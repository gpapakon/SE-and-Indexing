<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR TREATING INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE WITH LEUKOTRIENE SYNTHESIS INHIBITORSThis is a continuation of copending application USSN 08/003,253 filed 1/11/93, which is a continuation of USSN 07/790,960, filed 11/12/91.Field of the InventionThe invention relates to methods for ameliorating symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease. More particularly, methods for use of four specific quinoline leu otriene synthesis inhibitors for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (regional enteritis) are disclosed.BackgroundThe clinical manifestations of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease share the common feature of inflammation. In ulcerative colitis the earliest lesion is an inflammatory infiltration with abscess formation at the base of the crypts of Lieberkœçhn. Coalescence of these distended and ruptured crypts tends to separate the overlying mucosa from its blood supply, leading to ulceration. The inflammatory involvement is diffuse and superficial, usually limited to the mucosa and submucosa.The clinical picture includes cramping, lower abdominal pain or rectal bleeding, soon followed by frequent, loose discharges consisting mainly of blood, pus, and mucus with scanty fecal particles. The rectum and ampulla are usually found to be spastic.In Crohn's disease (also known as regional enteritis or ulcerative ileitis) the most prominent feature of the 

disease is the granular, reddish-purple, edematous thickening of the bowel wall. In the early phase of the disease, the prominent irritability, spasm, and edema give the appearance of a rigid contour to the diseased segment radiogenographically.The histological picture consists of dilated and tortuous lymph vessels and granulomatous structures which are made up predominantly of epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and occasionally giant cells. With the development of inflammation, these granulomas often lose their circumscribed borders and merge with the surrounding tissue reaction. Obstruction is the predominant clinical feature. The stools although loose are rarely bloody.Numerous mediators of inflammation have been demonstrated in the diseased tissue of inflammatory bowel disease. Among these are the prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Previous investigators have concluded that the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by cyclooxygenase inhibitors is either ineffective or contra- indicated for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis appears to be clinically beneficial.Leukotrienes

R-(-)-2-cyclopentyl-2-[4-(2-quinolinyl-methoxy)-phenyl]- acetic acid.
2. A method for inhibiting the synthesis of leukotrienes, which has a therapeutic effect on mediating the pathology associated with inflammatory bowel disease, with:
R-(-)-2-cycloheptyl-N-methylsulfonyl-2-[4-(2-quinolinyl- methoxy)-phenyl]-acetamide.
3. A method for inhibiting the synthesis of leukotrienes, which has a therapeutic effect on mediating the pathology associated with inflammatory bowel disease, with: (-)-2-cycloheptyl-2-[3-isobutyl-4-(2-quinolinyl-methoxy) -phenyl]-acetic acid.
4. A method for inhibiting the synthesis of leukotrienes, which has a therapeutic effect on mediating the pathology associated with inflammatory bowel disease, w i t h : (-)-2-hydroxy-2-(2-indanyl)-2-[4-(2-quinolinyl-methoxy)- phenyl]-acetic acid.
