<ABSTRACT>
A hand-piece (2) comprises a housing (3), a drive sleeve (7) which is mounted therein, into which a tool (9) with its shaft (11) can be inserted and which is mounted in the housing (3) so as to be rotatable about its central axis (9a) via a drive, a releasable coupling for connection of the shaft (11) rotational drive in the drive sleeve (7) and a releasable coupling for axial connection of the shaft (11) to the drive sleeve (7). The couplings are each formed by a coupling recess (18) in the shaft (11) and a coupling pin (19), engaging therein, on the drive sleeve (7). In this hand-piece the two couplings are formed by at least one common coupling recess (18) and the common coupling pin (19) is mounted so as to be moveable between a coupling position engaging in the coupling recess (18) and a decoupling position in which the coupling recess (18) is released, and is pretensioned in its coupling position and relative to the shaft (11) by the force of a spring (34).

Angle-shaped or straight handpiece (2; 55) having a
releasable mounting device and having a tool (9), in

particular for medical purposes, having

a housing (3; 56),
a drive sleeve (7; 61) mounted therein, in which the
tool (9) can be placed with its shaft (11), and which

is mounted in the housing (3; 56) rotatable around its
middle axis (9a; 58) by means of a drive,
a releasable coupling for connecting the shaft (11)
in the drive sleeve (7) so that they rotate together,
and a releasable coupling for the axial connection
of the shaft (11) with the drive sleeve (7),

characterised in that,

both couplings are formed by means of at least one
common coupling recess (18) in the shaft (11) and at

least one common coupling pin (19) provided on the
drive sleeve (7; 61), which pin is mounted movably

between a coupling disposition engaging into the
coupling recess (18) and a de-coupling position

freeing the coupling recess (18), and is biased by
means of the force of a spring (34) into its coupling

position and against the shaft (11).
Angle-shaped or straight handpiece (2) having a
releasable mounting device and having a tool (9), in

particular for medical purposes, having

a housing (3),
a drive sleeve (7) mounted therein, in which the
tool (9) can be placed with its shaft (11), and which

is displaceable back and forth, in the longitudinal
direction of its middle axis (9a), by means of a

drive,
a releasable coupling for connecting the shaft (11)
in the drive sleeve (7) in its axial direction,
and a releasable coupling for connecting the shaft 
(11) with the drive sleeve (7) in its circumferential

direction,

characterised in that,

both couplings are formed by means of at least one
common coupling recess (18) in the shaft (11) and at

least one common coupling pin (19) provided on the
drive sleeve (7), which pin is mounted movably between

a coupling disposition engaging into the coupling
recess (18) and a de-coupling position freeing the

coupling recess (18), and is biased by means of the
force of a spring (34) into its coupling position and

against the shaft (11).
Handpiece according to any preceding claim,

characterised in that,

there are provided a plurality of coupling recesses
(18) arranged distributed on the periphery of the

shaft (11), and one or more coupling pins (19).
Handpiece according to claim 3,

characterised in that,

the coupling recesses (18) are arranged in one and the
same transverse plane of the shaft (11).
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that,

the coupling pin (19) at its coupling end is rounded
in a ball shape or is formed by a ball.
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that,

the coupling pin (19) is mounted in a radial guide, in
particular in a radial guide hole (8) of the drive

sleeve (7). 
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that,

a movement stop (23a) is associated with the coupling
pin (19) which prevents the coupling pin (19) falling

out when the tool (9) is drawn out of its holder, in
particular out of the drive sleeve (7).
Handpiece according to claim 6 or 7,

characterised in that,

the guide hole (8) is tapered in its inner edge region
by an amount which is lesser than the cross-sectional

dimension of the coupling pin (19).
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that,

the dimension of the coupling pin (19) extending in
the radial direction of the drive sleeve (7) is

greater than the radial thickness of the drive sleeve
(7; 56a).
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding

claims,

characterised in that,

the coupling pin (19) and the drive sleeve (7) are
adjustable by means of an axially displaceably mounted

pressure member (27; 65), in particular formed by
means of a ring or a sleeve, which pressure member

acts against the coupling pin (19) with an internal
oblique or conical surface (28) and is axially acted

upon by means of the force of the spring (34).
Handpiece according to claim 10,

characterised in that,

the pressure member (27) is accessible from outside
the housing (3) directly manually or by means of an 

actuation element (29, 29a), in particular is
connected by means of an actuating element (29, 29a;

62) accessible from the side or from the side away
from the tool, with which actuating element the

pressure member is displaceable against the force of
the spring (34; 78) into a release disposition freeing

the coupling pin (19).
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding
claims,

characterised in that,

the coupling recess (18) is formed outwardly
divergently and/or the coupling pin (19) is formed

convergently at its coupling end in such a manner that
upon drawing out of the shaft (11) from the drive

sleeve (7) the coupling pin (19) is forced out of its
coupling position into its de-coupling position.
Handpiece according to one or more of the preceding
claims,
