<ABSTRACT>
In a narrow-band filter for filtering an input 
signal having a predetermined frequency and comprising 

first through n-th low-pass filters (13-1 to 13-n) which 
are connected in parallel to one another, a switching 

circuit time divisionally connects the first through the 
n-th low-pass filters between input and output terminals 

(11, 12). The first through the n-th low-pass filters, 
thereby, time divisionally filters the input signal for 

first through n-th filtering durations, respectively. A 
control circuit (30) is supplied with a frequency 

designation signal designating the predetermined 
frequency and controls the switching circuit to change at 

least one of the first through the n-th filtering 
durations in accordance with the frequency designation 

signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a narrow-band filter
having a variable center frequency. Such a narrow-band
filter is particularly useful for detecting a plurality
of tone signals which have different frequencies.In general, a narrow-band filter comprises an
input terminal supplied with an input signal having a
predetermined frequency, an output terminal, first
through n-th low-pass filters which are connected in
parallel to one another, where n represents a first
positive integer greater than unity, a switching circuit
connected to the first through the n-th low-pass filters,
and a control circuit for controlling the switching
circuit. The first through the n-th low-pass filters
have the same filter characteristic and are collectively
called an n-path filter. The control circuit delivers
first through n-th switch driving signals to the
switching circuit. Supplied with the first through the
n-th switch driving signals, the switching circuit time
divisionally connects the first through the n-th low-pass
filters one by one between the input and the output
terminals at a predetermined period Tp. As a result of
switching operation of the switching circuit, the first 
through the n-th low-pass filters time divisionally
filter the input signal for first through n-th
filtering durations, respectively. The first through the
n-th filtering durations are equal to one another. In
this event, the narrow-band filter has a single center
frequency fc. Such a narrow-band filter is disclosed in
JP-A-16013/1985.In the meantime, a mobile radio telephone system
of an AMPS type uses an SAT (Supervisory Audio Tone)
signal in order to monitor a connection state of a radio
channel. The SAT signal is carried by a radio signal and
has one of first through third tone frequencies which are
equal to 5970 (Hz), 6000 (Hz), and 6030 (Hz), respectively,
and which are assigned to base stations. Let the mobile
radio telephone system comprise first through third base
stations which are assigned with the first through the
third tone frequencies, respectively. When the first
base station transmits the SAT signal having the first
tone frequency, a mobile station receives the SAT signal
transmitted from the first base station. When the mobile
station detects the first tone frequency of the SAT signal,
the mobile station transmits a transmission signal, as an
answer back signal, having a frequency equal to the first
tone frequency. On reception of the transmission signal
having the frequency equal to the first tone frequency,
the first base station
