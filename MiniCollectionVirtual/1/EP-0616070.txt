<ABSTRACT>
A washer/dryer comprises a drum (4) to receive the items to be 
washed and/or dried and a fuel fired burner (1) to provide hot 

exhaust gas, the drum having a first inlet (11) to receive water 
during a wash cycle to wash the items, a second inlet (8) to 

receive hot exhaust gas during a drying cycle to dry the 
items, a first outlet (17) to discharge the water and a second 

outlet to discharge the hot exhaust gas from the drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a washer/drier.FR 1164718 discloses a washer/drier in which during
a washing cycle hot gas convects through a heat exchanger
for heating washing water, and during a drying cycle is
pumped into the drum containing clothes. This prior art forms the
preamble of independent claim 1.The present invention provides an apparatus for
washing and drying items comprises a drum to receive
items to be washed and/or dried the drum having a first
inlet to receive water during a wash cycle to wash the
items, a second inlet to receive hot exhaust gas during a
drying cycle to dry the items, a first outlet to
discharge the water, and a second outlet to discharge the
hot exhaust gas from the drum, a heat exchanger through
which, during a wash cycle, the water circulates from and
to the drum and also through which, during the wash
cycle, the hot exhaust gas passes to heat the water
before it re-enters the drum , and a fan for
forcing hot exhaust gas into the drum and
a fuel fired burner
to provide hot exhaust gas, the hot exhaust gas leaving
the burner to pass to the heat exchanger, and another
fan for forcing hot exhaust gas into the heat exchanger and control
means for selectively operating the fans.Preferably the first inlet is connected to a hot
water pipe and to a cold water pipe.Suitably the first inlet is connected to a soap 
powder receptacle whereby soap powder can be transported
into the drum by the water.Conveniently means is provided to heat the water
after it enters the drum.Preferably means is provided to circulate the water
between the heat exchanger and the drum during the wash
cycle.Suitably the circulating means is a pump.
Preferably the fan forcing hot exhaust gas into the heat exchanger is
located in the hot gas outlet of the drum and the fan forcing hot exhaust
gas into the drum is located in a hot gas outlet of the heat exchanger.An embodiment of the present invention will now be
described by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the
functional elements of a washer/dryer;Fig. 2 is a flow chart diagram of a typical
washer/dryer washing cycle; and Figure 3 is flow chart diagram illustrating a typical
washer/dryer drying cycle;Figure 1 illustrates a washer/dryer comprising a burner 1,
control means 2 for controlling the operation of the burner
and ducts 3 for directing hot exhaust gas separately from the
burner to a drum 4 by a fan 5 on the hot gas outlet side of
the drum. Alternatively, the hot

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for washing and drying items comprising
a drum (4) to receive items to be washed and/or dried,

the drum (4) having a first inlet (11) to receive water
during a wash cycle to wash the items, a second inlet (8)

to receive hot exhaust gas during a drying cycle to dry
the items, a first outlet (17) to discharge the water,

and a second outlet to discharge the hot exhaust gas from
the drum (4), a heat exchanger (6) through which, during

a wash cycle, the water circulates from and to the drum
(4) and also through which, during the wash cycle, the

hot exhaust gas passes to heat the water before it re-enters
the drum (4), a fan (7) for forcing hot

exhaust gas into the drum (4), and
a fuel fired burner (1) to provide hot

exhaust gas, the hot exhaust gas leaving the burner (1)
to pass to the heat exchanger (6), characterised by a another fan (5)

for forcing hot exhaust gas into the heat exchanger (6) and control
means (2) for selectively operating the fans (5, 7).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first
inlet is connected to a hot water pipe (12) and a cold

water pipe (13).
An apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the first inlet (11) is connected to a soap 

powder receptacle (14) whereby soap powder can be
transported into the drum (14) by the water.
An apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein means (10) is provided to circulate the water

between the heat exchanger (10) and the drum (4) during
the wash cycle.
An apparatus according to claim 4 wherein the
circulating means is a pump (10).
An apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein the fan (5) forcing hot exhaust gas into the heat exchanger is located

in the hot gas outlet of the drum and the fan (7) forcing not exhaust gas
into the drum is located in a hot gas outlet (9) of the heat exchanger.
