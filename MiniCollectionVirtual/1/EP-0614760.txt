<ABSTRACT>
A leading-edge stop for aligning sheets of paper on the feed table of a sheet-processing machine, in particular a printing machine, which stop is arranged on, and so that it can be pivoted with, a front-lay body which can be pivoted cyclically about an axis in accordance with the conveying cycle from an aligning position into a rest position and back into the aligning position and is fixed so as to be adjustable via an adjusting means in its position in the conveying or counter-conveying direction of the sheets relative to the front-lay body in its position of alignment to engage and disengage the aligning function of the leading-edge stop, such that the leading-edge stop itself is the adjusting means.

<CLAIMS>
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets (1) on
the feed table (7) of a sheet-processing machine, in

particular of a sheet-printing machine, which is arranged
co-pivotably on a front-mark body (10) which is pivotable

about a shaft (5) cyclically corresponding to the conveying
cycle from an aligning position into a rest position

and back into the aligning position, and which is
fastened displaceably via an adjusting means in its

position in the conveying or counter-conveying direction
of the paper sheets in relation to the front-mark body in

its aligning position for application and retraction of
its aligning function, and more than one of which are

present on the feed table, characterized in that the
front-edge stop (2) itself is the adjusting means,

against whose element for force introduction for the
displacing movement the paper sheets bear in the aligning

position.
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets on the
feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 1, characterized in that the front-edge
stop is of rotationally symmetrical design, that the

front-edge stop is mounted rotatably about its axis of
symmetry in the front-mark body (10), and that

corresponding deflection elements for generating a
translatory movement of the front-edge stop in the

direction of the axis of symmetry as a result of the
rotary movement are provided on the front-edge stop and

on the front-mark body (10).
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets on the 
feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 1, characterized in that a stop (11)
for limiting the displacement path of the front-edge stop

in the counter-conveying direction of the sheets in
relation to the front-mark body (10) is provided on the

front-mark body (10), the front-edge stop assuming its
applied position for aligning the sheet front-edge in the

aligning position of the front-mark body (10) when the
front-edge stop bears against the stop (11) on the front-mark

body (10).
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets on the
feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 2, characterized in that the
rotationally symmetrical front-edge stop is, on its

circumferential surface (19), designed with regions for
force introduction for the rotary displacement.
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets on the
feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 4, characterized in that the
rotationally symmetrical front-edge stop is, on its

circumferential surface (19), designed with static
friction surface regions.

feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 5, characterized in that the static
friction surfaces are knurled or rubber-coated regions.
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets on the
feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 2, characterized in that the front-edge
stop is the head (2) of a screw (3, 21), the thread (4)

of which corresponds to a nut thread in the front-mark
body (10).

feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 2, characterized in that the front-edge
stop (2) is designed as a pin (15), that either the

front-edge stop or the front-mark body (10) is designed
with an axial cam (16) and that the other of the two is

provided with a cam-following element (17) corresponding 
to the axial cam (16).
Front-edge stop for aligning paper sheets on the
feed table of a sheet-processing machine according to the

features of Claim 2, characterized in that the front-edge
stop is a nut (28) provided with an internal thread, the

internal thread of which corresponds to a screw thread
(29) provided on the front-mark body (10).
