<ABSTRACT>
A class of optionally 4-substituted 3-nitro-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrathydroquinoline derivatives are selective non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors and/or are antagonists of AMPA receptors, and are therefore of utility in the treatment of conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders, convulsions or schizophrenia, which require the administration of an NMDA and/or AMPA receptor antagonist.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Nitroquinolone derivatives as NMDA antagonistsThis invention relates to a class of optionally 4-substituted 3-nitro-2-oxo-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines which are selective non-competitive antagonists of N- methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. More particularly, the class of compounds provided by the present invention are ligands for the strychnine-insensitive glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor and are therefore useful in the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders arising as a consequence of such pathological conditions as stroke, hypoglycaemia, cerebral palsy, transient cerebral ischaemic attack, cerebral ischaemia during cardiac pulmonary surgery or cardiac arrest, perinatal asphyxia, epilepsy, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Olivo-ponto- cerebellar atrophy, anoxia such as from drowning, spinal cord and head injury, and poisoning by exogenous and endogenous NMDA receptor agonists and neurotoxins, including environmental neurotoxins.By virtue of their NMDA receptor antagonist properties, the compounds according to the present invention are also useful as anticonvulsant and antiemetic agents, as well as being of value in the prevention or reduction of dependence on dependence- inducing agents such as narcotics.NMDA receptor antagonists have recently been shown to possess analgesic (see, for example, Dickenson and Aydar, Neuroscience Lett.. 1991, 121. 263; Murray et al. , Pain, 1991, 4 179; and Woolf and Thompson, Pain, 1991, 44., 293) and anxiolytic (see, for example, Kehne et al. , Eur. J. Pharmacol.. 1991, 193, 283) effects, and the 

 compounds of the present invention may accordingly be useful in the management of pain and anxiety.Compounds possessing functional antagonist properties for the NMDA receptor complex are stated in WO-A-91/19493 to be effective in the treatment of mood disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, dysthymia and seasonal affective disorder (cf. also Trullas and Skolnick, Eur. J. Pharmacol.. 1990, 185. 1) . The compounds of the present invention may consequently be of benefit in the treatment and/or prevention of such disorders.The association of NMDA receptor antagonists with regulation of the dopaminergic system has recently been reported (see, for example, erling et al. , J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.. 1990, 255, 40; Graham et al. , Life Sciences, 1990, 42, PL-41; Hutson et al. , Br. J. Pharmacol.. 1991, 103, 2037; and Turski et al.. Nature ( ondon) . 1991, 349. 414) . This
