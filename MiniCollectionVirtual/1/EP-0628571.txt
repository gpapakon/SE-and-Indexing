<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a novel peptide derivative comprising RGD as the basic skeleton and having antithrombotic, anticoagulant 
and cell fusion inhibiting effects. The invention provides also an antithrombotic agent which is efficacious against 

thrombosis and thrombolus during or after thrombolytic therapy and which can prevent the recurrence of such diseases and myocardial 

infarction, and anticoagulant for extracorporeal circulation which can inhibit clotting as the principal cause of thrombus 
during extracorporeal circulation, a cell fusion inhibitor, a cancer metastasis inhibitor, and a protective for a platelet preparation 

for transfusion, each containing the above derivative as the active ingredient. The invention further provides a pack of a platelet 
preparation for transfusion containing the derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel peptides and the like 
having an inhibitory action on platelet aggregation, and platelet 
aggregation-inhibiting agents, blood coagulation-inhibiting agents for 
extracorporeal circulation, cell adhesion-inhibiting agents, tumor 
metastasis-inhibiting agents and agents for protecting platelet 
preparations for blood transfusion which comprise the novel peptides or 
the like as active ingredients as well as platelet preparation packs 
for blood transfusion which comprise the novel peptides in the platelet 
preparations for blood transfusion in the packs. Platelets play an important role in hemostasis by adhering to 
the surface of a damaged blood vessel. However, it is known that platelet aggregation is primarily 
responsible for the formation of thrombus and that the formed thrombus 
obstructs a blood vessel. This obstruction prevents the adequate 
supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs and thereby causes 
ischemic diseases in circulatory organs as represented by myocardial 
infarction and cerebral infarction. At present, the mortality rates of 
these ischemic diseases follow that of cancer, which has become a 
significant social problem.  When medical treatments involving the extracorporeal circulation 
of blood, as exemplified by the use of an artificial heart and lung 
during surgical operations and renal dialysis for patients with renal 
failure, are conducted, blood coagulation may be caused by the 
activation and aggregation of platelets, which greatly disturb the 
performance of such treatments. Thus, the prevention of thrombus formation and blood coagulation 
is an important matter in avoiding the occurrence of ischemic diseases 
or in safely conducting extracorporeal circulation. Platelets are activated by the binding, to receptors on a 
platelet membrane, of thrombin present in plasma, connective tissue 
proteins such as collagen present in subendothelial tissues that may 
become exposed by damage to a blood vessel and other substances. 
Platelets are also activated by the binding of released adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP), adrenaline, serotonin, thromboxane (TX) A2 and the 
like to membrane receptors in a manner like autosecretion. Two kinds 
of glycoprotein units which compose a fibrinogen receptor are presented 
on the cell surface and associated to form a receptor complex 
(gpIIbIIIa), whereby aggregation via a fibrinogen bridge is induced. Patients with thrombasthenia characterized by congenital absence 
of gpIIb and gpIIIa do not have a
