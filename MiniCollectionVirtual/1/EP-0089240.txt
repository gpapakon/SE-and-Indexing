<ABSTRACT>
It is possible to detect pregnancy in an animal, particuÂ­
larly a mammal, at an early stage, by detecting physiological 

changes which result from increased activity of the 
haemostatic system; and especially the enhanced platelet 

adhesion or aggregation.

EARLY PREGNANCY TESTING METHOD
 The present invention relates to the detection of pregnancy in manmals (particularly agricultural and domestic animals) at a very early stage. The invention is based on the monitoring of changes in the haemostatic system (i.e.


the blood coagulation system).


 Traditionally, the diagnosis of pregnancy is based on missed menstrual periods (human) or a failure to return to oestrus (animal species). Depending on the mammal species, this may take from several days to several weeks.


 For humans, the most   commonly    used experimental test for detecting pregnancy is based upon the immunological detection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). HCG is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy, and may be found in blood and urine samples of pregnant women. The latex particle test for HCG is well known and well established for use with humans. However, the HCG hormone does not appear in conveniently measurable   amounts    until about 2 or 3 weeks following a missed period.


By this time pregnancy, if it exists, can no longer be terminated by menstrual regulation and abortion, if required, must be brought about by more complicated techniques.


 In non-human animals, the production of chorionic gonadotrophin does not occur until much later in pregnancy than in humans. The early detection of pregnancy would be
 an important advantage in monitoring artificial insemination
 (for example, in cattle) or in the early detection of  pregnancy in horse stud farms. At present there is for all practical purposes no test capable of detecting pregnancy at an early stage in such animals e.g. in less than a month following conception.


 It has been known for some time that during pregnancy dramatic changes occur in the human haemostatic system. In particular fibrin levels in the blood are enhanced, together with levels of other haemostatic factors. This is believed to be due to the requirements of the placenta and particularly to a need to staunch blood flow during and after placental separation at birth. The overall changes are consistent with the enhanced generation of thrombin. It has normally been possible to detect the effect of pregnancy on the haemostatic system from the third month of pregnancy onwards in humans.


 The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that detectable effects related to changes in the haemostatic system occur at a very much earlier stage in pregnancy than had been realised hitherto. Indeed, the changes closely follow

CLAIMS:
 1. A method of detecting pregnancy in a mammal at an early stage, characterized by detecting physiological change consequent on increased activity of the haemostatic system resulting from the preganancy.




 2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized by detecting enhanced activation of blood platelets.



 3. A method according to Claim 2 characterized in that the platelet activation is detected in the presence of an inhibitor for preventing non-pregnancyspecific activation.



 4. A method according to Claim 3 characterized in that the inhibitor prevents non-pregnancy-specific activation by an activator selected from proteases, prostaglandins and adenosine diphosphate.



 5. A method according to Claim 3 characterized in that the inhibitor is selected from heparin, anti-thrombin, acetyl salicylic acid, indomethacin, a combination of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenol pyruvate, and adenosine.
