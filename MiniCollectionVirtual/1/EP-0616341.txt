<ABSTRACT>
A stationary reduction apparatus is arranged so that coil 
groups comprising plate type (or disc type) coils, which are 

stacked up in multiple layers with spacers inserted 
therebetween to traverse through a core whereby a refrigerant 

may pass through inter-layer clearances, are provided and 
divided into a plurality of coil sub-groups and every other 

coil sub-group of the divided coil sub-groups is surrounded by 
a refrigerant guide which is provided with an opening on its 

internal periphery and refrigerant flow ports on its external 
periphery, and the refrigerant is introduced into the 

refrigerant guide to flow in a horizontal direction through 
respective inter-layer clearances of the stacked-up coil 

groups, thereby the coil groups are effectively cooled without 
accelerating the velocity of refrigerant flow.
