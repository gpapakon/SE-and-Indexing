<CLAIMS>
Physical structure (T) of a bulk memory sub-system (SSM
1

to SSM
3
) connected to at least one host system (H
1
, H
2
)
comprising:


a plurality of groupings of disk units (101 to
112, 201 to 212, ..., 601 to 612) arranged within

the structure, in a plurality of compartments each
receiving at least one unit, and
at least one electric power supply for the units
(AL
1
, AL
2
),

characterised in that it comprises:

a front portion (PAV) comprising a set of plates
parallel to each other (P
1
 to P
6
), capable of
sliding inside compartments and carrying a

plurality of disk units arranged side by side on
either side of a central portion (CDA
1
) carrying
an electronic board to which they are connected,

the latter ensuring either real-time management of
the disk units of the plate, or simply their

connection to the host system,
a rear portion (PAR) comprising in particular the
electric power supply,
a backplane (FP) connected on the one hand to each
of the electronic boards of the plates and on the

other hand to the host system (H
1
) via connection
means arranged in the rear portion (CAR, CX
1
, CX
2
),
the design of the connections made to the

backplane making it possible to give the sub-system
a predetermined configuration (SSM
1
, SSM
2
,
SSM
3
).
Physical structure according to Claim 1, characterised
in that, within a plate, the disk units are divided

into two rows parallel to each other, the different
disk units constituting each row being arranged side by

side, their longitudinal axis being perpendicular to
the longitudinal axis of the plate (101 to 106, on the

one hand, 107 to 112 on the other hand).
Structure according to Claim 2, characterised in that
each disk unit in a row is provided with connection

means (CN
101
 to CN
106
, CN
107
 to CN
112
) arranged at the side
of the electronic board, which are connected to

corresponding connection means belonging to said

electronic board, the connection means thereof (C
101
 to
C
106
, C
107
 to C
112
) being fixed on the longitudinal sides
of the board, while being spaced out evenly thereon.
Physical structure according to one of Claims 2, 3,
characterised in that the rear portion (PAR) comprises

ventilation means (V
1
, V
2
) mounted within the electric
power supply (AL
1
, AL
2
), making it possible to ensure
ventilation for said power supply and for all the

plates, each plate comprising on its front edge,
arranged towards the outside of the tray (T) and on its

rear edge, arranged on the backplane side (FP), evenly
spaced ventilation holes (TVA, TVR) allowing

ventilation air to pass through in a direction parallel
to the length of each plate, this ventilation air (V)

flowing from front to back in a direction parallel to
the length of the plates.
Structure according to one of Claims 2, 3 characterised
in that each plate (P
1
 to P
6
) comprises, on each of its
longitudinal edges, levers for extracting and inserting

each disk unit of a row (EX
101
 to EX
105
, EX
106
 to EX
110
),
which can occupy two positions, a first "extraction"

position (POS
1
) and a second "insertion" position 
(POS
2
), the levers being able to effect a rotation about
a hinge perpendicular to the plane of the plate, making

it possible to pass from the extraction position into
the insertion position, the disk unit associated with

the lever being either external to the plate, or not
connected to the electronic board when the lever is in

the first position and being connected to that same
board when the lever is in the second position.
Structure according to Claim 5, characterised in that
each disk unit is mounted on a support via fastening

means, these comprising on the one hand a plurality of
feet (F0
1
 to F0
4
) arranged on the lower portion of the
disk and, on the other hand, shoulders belonging to the

support intended to come into contact with said feet,
and connection means between the feet and the

shoulders, each support comprising, in its front
portion, an opening (0) inside which is inserted the

connector (CN
101
 to CN
110
 or CN
112
) for the disk when the
latter is mounted on its support.
Structure according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the support (SD) comprises, on the side of its rear

portion, a slot (R) the axis of which is parallel to
the longitudinal axis of the plate (P
1
 to P
6
) when the
corresponding disk unit is mounted thereon, the slot

comprising a first portion (R
1
) and a second portion
(R
2
), the two portions being contiguous, the first
having a rectangular form terminated by a semicircle of

a given length (1) and the second having a circular
form of a diameter greater than (1).
Structure according to Claim 7, characterised in that
each extraction and insertion lever (EX
101
 to EX
112
)
comprises a vertical portion (EV) and a horizontal

portion (EH), the vertical portion (EV) being
manipulated by an operator, while the horizontal 

portion (EH) comprises a spigot (TET) that can be
introduced into the second portion (R
2
) of the slot (R)
and being able to slide parallel to the axis of this

slot (R) in such a way that, passing from the position
where it is inside the second portion (R
2
) to the
position where it is inside the semicircle of the first

portion (R
1
), the corresponding extraction lever passes
from the first extraction position (POS
1
) to the
insertion position (POS
2
).
