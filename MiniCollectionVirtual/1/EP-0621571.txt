<ABSTRACT>
A machine for dispensing products (6) through its upper side, within 
which 

the products are piled up in a closed channel (1) containing products 
so that 

said products cannot go laterally out of the channel. The pile of 
products 

rests on a lifting platform (5) which, by means of a conventional gear, 
lifts, 

every time coins are introduced into the machine, a height equal to that 
of the product to be dispensed. The channel is open at its upper side, so 

that the products, when arriving at their exit position controlled by a 
conventional 

gear controlling the height, are dispensed out of the machine by 
means of other conventional gear pushing (4) the product out of the 

channel. As 
a second option, the device pushing the product out can be omitted if the 

supporting platform is designed in a tilted position, in which case the 
products will fall by gravity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a machine dispensing productos to consumers 
through an opening on its upper side. At present, the existing dispensing machines are designed so that the product 
goes out via an opening located at the upper side of same. Since the 
slot for introducing coins is arranged in such a position which is comfortable 
to a consumer, that is to say, so that he/she can introduce coins without 
the need to lift his/her arm too much, it happens that, then, when the product 
is dispensed through the lower side of the machine, the consumer is compelled 
to stoop to pick up the object dispensed, which means to adopt an uncomfortable 
enough position. In order to overcome this drawback, the dispensing machine has been designed 
with the aim of selling directly products, with delivery of same at the upper 
part of the machine, with the characteristic that the produt goes out of the 
machine through the upper part of same, at the most comfortable height, the 
body of a person being at a normal position remaining upright. This means a 
great comfort to a consumer with regard to pick up said products, without 
being compelled to stoop, as it happens at present with the conventional dispensing 
machines. The product is placed in a channel having adequate size to receive the products 
to be dispensed. Each machine can have as many channels as desired in 
order to dispense different products. In the channel, there is installed a lifting platform on which the products 
rest, with a capacity for as many units as admitted by the height of channel 
or channels. The platform moves vertically upward by means of a lifting system which can 
be hydraulic, mechanical, electrical, pneumatic or by a combination thereof. 
Said lifting system rises the platform every time a product is requested, at 
a height according to the position of said product (for example, for a product 
having 25 mm thickness, the platform lifting in that moment will be 25 mm.  Two outlet systems are possible: 
A) The platform is installed tilted, which means that the products are 
tilted in a same manner, so that when a product arrives at the upper side 
of the channel, the product falls per se. B) The platform is installed horizontal, which means that the products, 
that, due to their package, are not flat, when arriving at the upper part 
of the machine, are delivered by means of a gear pushing the product toward 
the outlet. The object of the present invention will be better understood through 
the aid of the following
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1.- A machine for dispensing products with delivery at its upper side, 
characterized in that the products are piled in a closed channel containing 

the products so that the product cannot' go laterally out of the channel, and 
the pile of products rests on a lifting platform which, by means of a conventional 

gear, lifts, every time coins are introduced into the machine, 
a height which is equal to that of the product to be dispensed, and in that 

the channel is open at its upper side so that the products, when arriving at 
its outlet position, which is controlled by a conventional gear controlling 

the height, are dispensed out of the machine by means of other conventional 
device pushing the product out of the channel. 
2.- A machine for dispensing products with delivery at its upper side, 
according to claim 1, characterized in that the device pushing the product 

has been omitted because the supporting platform has been arranged in a 
tilted position, so that the packages will fall by gravity.
