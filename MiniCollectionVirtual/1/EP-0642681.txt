<ABSTRACT>
Method of controlling a current generator (1) having two voltage inputs (9, 10) and an output (13) connected to a load (6). In case the impedance of the load is lower than a first value, the generator is controlled in a non-feedback way to generate a signal, the current value of which is determined by the input voltage. On the other hand when the impedance of the load is higher than a second value larger than the first value, the output signal is negatively fed back to generate a signal on the output, the voltage value of which signal is determined by the input voltage. Thus, the output signal is automatically adapted to the desired mode of operation of the receiving apparatus (5). The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a current 
generator, which generator has two voltage inputs 
and a current output connected to a load, and generates a 
current on the output that is proportional to the difference 
voltage of the voltages on the inputs. The invention 
also relates to an apparatus for use with the method. In many devices in the field of control engineering, e.g. 
regulators, actuators and sensors for proportional control, 
output values, i.e. desired values and actual values 
for e.g. valve positions and temperatures, are generally 
represented by the voltage of an analogue signal 
that can range between e.g. 0 and 10 volts. In many other 
devices receiving these analogue signals, these values 
are expected to be in the form of a current signal, e.g. 
0 to 20 mA. This constitutes a problem, as not all devices will interact, 
while the output of a device does not correspond 
to the expected input of another device. In certain devices 
the mode of operation, i.e. current control or 
voltage control, can be switched by means of a jumper, 
e.g., but this switch means one more installation step 
and it can also lead to an incorrect installation. Also, 
two separate solutions, one for current control and one 
for voltage control, lead to a higher cost for electronic 
circuitry. Accordingly, the main object of the present invention is 
to achieve such a method of controlling the output of a 
current generator that this output is automatically adapted 
to the preferred mode of operation of a receiving  
 
device. The invention also relates to an apparatus for 
implementation of this method. The present invention is based on the realization that 
the abovementioned object can be achieved using the fact 
that a current controlled input has a much lower input 
impedance than a voltage controlled input. According to the invention, this object is achieved by a 
method of controlling a current generator having two 
voltage inputs and an output connected to a load, which 
generator generates on the output a current proportional 
to the difference voltage of the voltages on the inputs, 
so that, if the impedance of the load is lower than a 
predetermined first lower limiting value, the current 
generator is controlled in a non-feedback way to generate 
a signal on the output of the generator, the current 
value of which signal is determined by said input voltage, 
and that, if the impedance of the load is higher 
than a predetermined second limiting value larger than 
said first
