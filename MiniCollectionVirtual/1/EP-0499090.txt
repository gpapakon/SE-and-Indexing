<CLAIMS>
Process for the HT dyeing of polyester or polyester-containing 
textile materials at pH 8 to pH 11, characterised in 

that one or more monoazo dyes are used of the general formula I 

 
where 


X¹
is hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 
1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
X²
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
X³
is hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 
1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
X⁴
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
Y¹
is hydrogen or methyl, 
Y²
is hydrogen, 
Y³
is hydrogen, 
Y⁴
is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or alkoxy of 1 to 
4 carbon atoms, and 
R
is hydrogen, allyl or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms which 
may be substituted by alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
 
and Y¹, instead of denoting hydrogen or methyl, and Y², instead 

of denoting hydrogen, may also be combined with the benzene ring 
to which they are attached to form a naphthyl radical and Y² and 

Y³, instead of each denoting hydrogen, may together form a direct 
bond. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that in 
the general formula I X² is hydrogen, X³ is nitro or alkylsulphonyl 

of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or else chlorine or bromine when 
at the same time X¹ is nitro or methylsulphonyl, and R is hydrogen, 

allyl or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, although, when X¹ is 
methylsulphonyl, X³ must not at the same time be alkylsulphonyl 

of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and vice versa. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that one 
or more monoazo dyes are used of the general formula Ia  

 

 
where 


X¹
is chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 
carbon atoms, 
X³
is chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 
carbon atoms, 
X⁴
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, and 
Y⁴
is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or alkoxy of 1 to 
4 carbon atoms, 
 
although X¹ and X³ must not both be alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 

carbon atoms. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that in 
the general formula Ia 

X¹ is nitro, X³ is nitro, X⁴ is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
and Y⁴ is hydrogen. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that one 
or more monoazo dyes are used of the general formula Ib 


 
where 


X¹
is hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 
1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
X²
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
X³
is chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 
carbon atoms, 
X⁴
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, and 
R
is hydrogen, allyl or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms which 
may be substituted by alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
 
although X¹ and X³ must not both be alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 

carbon atoms. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in that in 
the general formula Ib X¹ is chlorine, X³ is nitro, and X², X³ and 

R are each hydrogen.  
 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that one 
or more monoazo dyes are used of the general formula Ic 


 
where 


X¹
is hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 
1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
X²
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
X³
is chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 
carbon atoms, 
X⁴
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
Y¹
is hydrogen or methyl, and 
R
is hydrogen, allyl or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms which 
may be substituted by alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
 
although X¹ and X³ must not both be alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 

carbon atoms. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterised in that in 
the general formula Ic 


X¹
is chlorine, bromine, nitro or methylsulphonyl, 
X²
is hydrogen, 
X³
is nitro or alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 
X⁴
is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine, 
Y¹
is hydrogen or methyl, and 
R
is allyl or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and in particular 
hydrogen, 
 
although, when X¹ is methylsulphonyl, X³ must not at the same 

time be alkylsulphonyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or vice versa. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the dyeing is carried out at pH 9 to 

pH 10. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the dyeing is carried out in the presence 

of one or more buffer substances which have a buffering effect 
in the particular pH range used.
