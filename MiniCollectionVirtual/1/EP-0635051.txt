<ABSTRACT>
Two nucleotide sequences encoding two different polypeptides found in yeast trehalose synthase have been isolated and cloned. A third polypeptide has been isolated from the enzyme and characterized, and a method is provided to isolate and clone the nucleotide sequence encoding this polypeptide. The coding sequences can be inserted into suitable vectors and used to transform host cells. The transformed cells will produce increased amounts of trehalose compared to the untransformed wild types and have increased tolerance to a variety of stresses, in particular to decreased availability of water. The invention may be used to improve the stress tolerance of organisms, to increase the storage life of foodstuffs and to produce trehalose economically on an industrial scale in an organism (e.g. baker's yeast) that is a traditional and safe foodstuff.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the genetic engineering of the
trehalose synthetic pathway of yeasts, such as baker's and
distiller's yeasts, and to the transfer of this pathway by
genetic engineering to other organisms. In particular, the
present invention concerns trehalose synthase, novel genes
encoding the trehalose synthase, novel vectors containing the
novel genes, and host cells and organisms transformed with the
novel vectors. The invention also relates to the production of
trehalose and ethanol and to the improvement of the stress
resistance of organisms, in particular yeasts and crop plants.It is well known that sugars and other polyhydric compounds
stabilize isolated proteins and phospholipid membranes during
dehydration, probably by replacing the water molecules that are
hydrogen-bonded to these macromolecules [reviewed by Crowe,
J.H. etal. (1987) Biochemical Journal 242, 1-10]. Trehalose
(α-glucopyranosyl-α-D-glucopyranose) is a dimer of two glucose
molecules linked through their reducing groups. Because it has
no reducing groups, it does not take part in the Maillard
reactions that cause many sugars to damage proteins, and it is
one of the most effective known protectants of proteins and
biological membranes in vitro.In nature, trehalose is found at high concentrations in yeasts
and other fungi, some bacteria, insects, and some litoral
animals, such as the brine shrimp. It is notable that all these
organisms are frequently exposed to osmotic and dehydration
stress. Accumulation of trehalose in higher plants is rare, but
high levels occur in the so-called resurrection plants, such as 
the pteridophyte, Selaginellalepidophylla, which can survive
extended drought [Quillet, M. and Soulet, M. (1964) Comptes
Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences, Paris 259, pp. 635-637;
reviewed by Avigad, G. (1982) in Encyclopedia of Plant Research
(New Series) 13A, pp. 217-347].
A decreased availability of intracellular water to proteins and
membranes is a common feature not only of dehydration and
osmotic stress, but also of freezing, in which ice formation
withdraws water from inside the cells, and heat stress, which
weakens the hydrogen bonds between water and biological
macromolecules. In recent years several publications have shown
a close connection between the trehalose content of yeast
cells, especially of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
their resistance to dehydration and osmotic, freezing and heat
stresses. This work has lead to the concept [summarized by
Wiemkem, A. (1990) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
