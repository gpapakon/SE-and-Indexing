<ABSTRACT>
A receptacle (10) is provided which is easier to hold in its horizontal position so as to prevent it from being floated during a soldering step. A support plate (40) is formed integral with a circuit board (36). The circuit board and support plate are located in a common plane. Support pads (28a) are matingly connected to a corresponding header (22b) of a housing (12) of the receptacle. The housing is supported by the circuit board on its solder tail-side surface and by the support plate (40) on its header-side surface through a support pad (28a) and held at a horizontal attitude relative to the circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
electric connector and, in particular, to a method of
mounting an electric connector on a circuit board and
to means for co-operating with the electric connector in
performing the method. For example,
a PCMCIA receptacle for connecting a memory card to a
printed circuit board belongs to the technical field of
the present invention.A through hole mount method and a face mount
method using no through holes are known as a method for
connecting an electric connector to a printed circuit
board.The through hole mount method comprises inserting
pin contacts of an electric connector into through holes
of a printed circuit board to achieve their soldering.
The drawbacks of this method lie in that, because of
the need to pierce through holes into a printed circuit
board, the method is not suitable for an electric connector
with pin contacts arranged at a very small pitch
from the viewpoint of a through hole formation limitation
and that, because the presence of through holes, a
wiring pattern to be formed on the printed circuit board
is subject to a design limitation.As an electric connector for connecting a memory 
card to a printed circuit board, the PCMCIA (Personal
Computer Memory Card International Association) receptacles
are commercially available on the market.In the case where the PCMCIA receptacle is mounted
on the printed circuit board, the face mount method is
employed because pin contacts are arranged at a very
small pitch. In the face mount method, the receptacle
is placed on the printed circuit board and those solder
tails of the receptacle are soldered to corresponding
solder pads on the printed circuit board by an infrared
radiation or a vapor-phase reflow soldering processing.
According to the face mount method for the PCMCIA
receptacles, it is possible to eliminate the
aforementioned two drawbacks.Unless, however, the receptacle or electric
connector is properly seated on the printed circuit
board and solder tails are properly seated on the
corresponding solder pads during a soldering time, the
receptacle is floated from the printed circuit board, or
tilted relative to the surface of the printed circuit
board, after the soldering step has been carried out.An object of the present invention is to provide a
method of mounting an electric connector on a circuit
board, which ensures better horizontal alignment of the
electric connector after a soldering step has been
done. Another object of the present invention is to provide means to perform the
mountin
