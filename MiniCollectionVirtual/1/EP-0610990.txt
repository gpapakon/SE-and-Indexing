<ABSTRACT>
A digital phase-locked loop with high resolution and wide modulation range is proposed which has a controller, the output of which is coupled to a controllable oscillator, and with a phase detector (1), the two inputs of which are provided for receiving a reference signal (REF) and an oscillator signal (OSC) to be generated by the oscillator, which   - contains a first circuit arm (36) for deriving a first value (Nf) from the time difference between reference points on the two input signals (REF, OSC) of the phase detector (1), - contains a second circuit arm (7) having a counting device which forms a difference, used for forming a second value (Ng), from a number of reference points of the reference signal (REF) and a number of reference points of the oscillator signal (OSC), which were detected from the start of a reference time (t=0).   Means are also provided for combining the first and second value (Nf, Ng).

Digital phase-locked loop with a controller (2),

and with a phase detector (1) which has a counting device

the pulsed signal (Q) to low-pass filtering, and in order
to code a sampled first value (Nf) of the low-pass-filtered

signal (QM) with a number of less significant
bits, the first value (Nf) being formed from the time

difference between reference points in the two input

order to code a second value (Ng) with a number of more
significant bits, the said second value (Ng) being formed

decision unit (29), and in that means (30) are
provided in order to integrate the output values from the 

threshold-value decision unit (29).
