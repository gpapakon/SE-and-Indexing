<ABSTRACT>
A cell for measuring electrokinetic potential, such a streaming potential, comprises a housing having an interior chamber divided into an upper compartment (466) and a lower compartment (468) by a filter mesh (414) on which is formed a pad of a fibrous dispersion to be measured. The cell is of particular utility in the manufacture of paper and is used in the manner described in EP-B-O 079 726. To assist flushing of the fibre pad from the filter mesh (414) a nozzle assembly (530) in the upper compartment is used to direct a jet of water at the filter mesh. An additional step to flush out fibrous material reaching the upper compartment (466) is described. This uses an additional port (520).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Streaming Potential Measuring Cell FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a measurement cell for use in measuring an electro inetic potential of a fibrous dispersion and to a measurement system using such'a cell. The furnish or stock supplied to a paper-making machine has certain electrical characteristics associated with it which affect the formation of the paper web on the Foudrinier wire. In particular there is a potential known as Zeta potential which is more usually monitored by measurement of a related potential known as streaming potential. Quality control in paper making has increased the demand for reliable, on-line measurement of streaming potential.Streaming potential is measured by means of a cell containing a chamber divided into two compartments by a filter mesh. A sample of the furnish is introduced into one compartment, the other being open, and a pad of fibrous material is formed on one side of the mesh. A controlled pressure differential is applied to the fluid in the compartments and appears across the measurement pad. This results in the development of streaming potential which is measured by two electrodes in the cell located on opposite sides of the pad. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEmbodiments of cells for measuring streaming potential are described in European patent EP-B-0 079 726. The patent also describes a preferred measurement system 

 in which the cell is to be connected and a measurement cycle for reliably obtaining streaming potentials. The cell has been found to provide a good, reliable on-line performance. However, certain problems can arise with prolonged on-line operation.The cell construction disclosed in the above patent comprises two frusto-conical compartments with their wider ends adjacent but separated by the mesh on which the pad is formed from the fibres in the furnish. The narrower ends of the cones provide inlet and outlet ports respectively. The cell assembly is mounted vertically with the mesh horiÎµontal. The pad is formed on the underside of the mesh by introducing furnish to the lower compartment. After measurement the pad is back-flushed from the mesh by fresh water admitted through the upper compartment port. To aid flushing an apertured cone is located in the upper compartment with the intention of distributing flushing water over the whole pad area. The pad is very firmly compacted on the mesh and it has been found that it is not always easy to remove it entirely.A second problem is that in forming the pad, fines, that is finer fibres and

Claims
1. A measurement cell for measuring an electrical characteristic of a fibrous dispersion comprising a housing having an internal chamber divided into two compartments by a filter mesh, a port in one compartment for introducing a fibrous dispersion into the chamber to form a fibrous pad on one side of the filter mesh, and means for introducing a fluid into the other compartment to flush the pad from the filter mesh, characterised in that: said fluid-introducing means comprises a nozzle for providing a pressurized-fluid spray over the side of the filter mesh facing said other compartment.
2. A measurement cell as claimed in Claim 1 in which said nozzle is adapted to provide a cone of pressurized spray and is mounted to have the axis of the cone aligned with the central axis of the filter mesh.
3. A measurement cell as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 in which said other compartment comprises a port allowing fluid from said nozzle to be circulated through said other compartment to flush out material from the fibrous dispersion that enters said other compartment.
4. A measurement system for measuring an electrical characteristic of a fibrous dispersion employing a measurement cell of the kind in which a chamber is divided into two compartments by a filter mesh and in which a measurement pad is formed on one side of the filter mesh by introducing a fibrous dispersion into one compartment 


 characterised in that: the other compartment has a simultaneously open inlet and outlet to allow a flushing fluid to be passed through the other compartment to remove therefrom
'
material from the fibrous dispersion that may have entered into the other compartment.
5. A measurement system as claimed in Claim 5 in which said flushing of the other compartment is performed after making potential measurements but before the pad is flushed from the cell.
