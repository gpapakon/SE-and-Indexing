<CLAIMS>
An apparatus with a control-and-display panel and a cooking 
surface (4) with at least one heating zone (7), particularly for a recessed built-in 

electric range top (2), wherein the control-and-display panel (5) has a 
control device and a display device (20, 21) for setting an electronic control 

unit (22) which generates control signals for the control of power switching 
components (24) for the heating elements assigned to one of the heating 

zones (7), and whereby, furthermore, the control device and the display 
device (20, 21) are arranged in a cut-out in the flat vitreous ceramic cooking 

surface (4) and characterised by the fact that one area of the cooking surface 
(4) is elevated and that the elevated section (9) at least partly overlaps the 

cut-out (8) and that the control and display devices (20, 21) are arranged on 

this elevated area (9). 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is situated in a front corner (3) of the cooking 

surface (4). 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is triangular. 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is shaped as a segment of a circle. 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is rectangular. 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is joined with adhesive to the cooking surface 

(4).  
 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is raised above the cooking surface (4) by the 

interposition of a spacer. 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
overlapping surface section (9) is made from a section of vitreous ceramic 

material. 
The range top as in Claim 1, characterised by the fact that 
where the cooking surface (4) has a raised metal edging rail (31), it is used as 

a heat-radiator. 
The range top as in Claim 9, characterised by the fact that the 
raised metal edging rail (31) is connected to a heat-radiating rail (30). 
The range top as in Claim 9, characterised by the fact that the 
raised metal edging rail (31) is directly connected to the fixings of the power 

switching components (24).
