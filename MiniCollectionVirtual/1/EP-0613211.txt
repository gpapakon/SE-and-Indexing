<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal assembly (2) comprising an 
electrical terminal (4) has an insulation displacement 

contact (24,26) having a base portion (12) from which 
extend a pair of coplanar arms (34) defining a slot (36) 

for receiving an insulated lead (L). A restraining flange 
(44) projecting from the top of each arm (36) at right-angles 

to its plane terminates in a foot (46) which is 
received in a well (74) in a housing (70) having a cavity 

(72) receiving the terminal assembly (2). The well (74) 
is dimensioned to allow the foot (46) to move parallel to 

the plane of the arms (34) but not at the right angles 
thereto. The arms (34) cannot, therefor, twist about 

their longitudinal axes under the lead insertion force, 
but can move in their own planes to accommodate the metal 

cone of the lead as it is forced into the slot (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an insulation displacement 
terminal assembly. There is disclosed in US-A-4,241,970 an electrical 
terminal assembly comprising an electrical terminal having 
an insulation displacement contact comprising a pair of 
coplanar arms projecting from a base portion and having 
opposed edges co-operating to define between them, a lead 
receiving slot opening in a direction away from the base 
portion. In this known terminal assembly the base portion of 
the terminal is supported in a first housing. In order to 
insert an insulated lead into the lead receiving slot of 
the terminal, the lead is supported in a second housing 
having a slot for receiving the arms of the insulation 
displacement contact, and the first and second housings 
are mated so that the lead is forced into the lead 
receiving slot, so that the edges of the slot make firm 
electrical contact with the metal core of the lead. It has been found that the natural tendency of the 
lead core under the lead insertion force is to cause one 
arm of the insulation displacement contact to move in a 
direction other than the plane of the plate forming the 
IDC slot and the other arm of the contact moves in the 
opposite sense. Such opposite displacement of the arms 
tends to cause the distance between the edges of the lead 
receiving slot to increase, thereby impairing the 
electrical conductivity between the lead core and the 
insulation displacement contact. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide 
an electrical terminal usable in high vibration 
atmospheres. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide an electrical terminal having an improved wire 
connection means. According to the present invention an electrical  
 
terminal assembly as defined in the second paragraph of 
this application is characterized by a restraining member 
outstanding from each arm of said insulation displacement 
contact and having a first end connected to said arm at a 
position remote from the base portion and a second end 
anchored to a housing receiving the terminal assembly, or 
being anchored to a second insulation displacement contact 
of the assembly; in such a way as to restrain movement of 
said arm, but so as to permit movement thereof in its own 
plane. Thus no housing having a slot for receiving the arms 
of the insulation displacement contact is needed for 
loading the terminal assembly with a lead. The lead may, 
therefore, be forced into the lead receiving slot of the 
contact by means of conventional tool for
