<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes various bicyclic 
amines that are effective in resensitizing multiple 
drug resistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents 
such as doxorubicin, vincristine and bisantrene. This 
resensitization has the effect of reducing the amount 
of chemotherapeutic agent necessary to kill those 
cells. In addition this potentiation of activity of 
the chemotherapeutic agent with the compounds of this 
invention makes it possible to treat multi-drug resistant 
tumors in animals. An object of this invention is to provide a 
method for increasing the sensitivity of multi-drug 
resistant cells by the use of compounds of this invention. An additional object of this invention is to 
provide a method for treating tumors that are either 
intrinsically or extrinsically multi-drug resistant in 
warm blooded animals by the administration of a therapeutically 
effective dose of a compound of this invention 
prior to, concurrent or after the administration 
of a therapeutically effective dose of an antitumor 
chemotherapeutic agent. Resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic 
drugs is an important problem in the clinical management 
of cancer. One type of resistance is  
 
characterized by the cross resistance to a wide variety 
of chemotherapeutic agents with no major structural 
similarities or similar modes of action. This 
phenomenon is termed multiple drug resistance. The 
evidence suggests that this form of resistance is due 
to the presence in tumor cells of a 170 kD transmembrane 
protein that is termed P-glycoprotein. It is 
thought that resistance is conferred by the ability of 
P-glycoprotein to actively transport chemotherapeutic 
agents out of the cells and thereby lower the intracellular 
concentrations of such drugs to non-toxic 
levels. Clinically this translates into a reduction of 
the therapeutic index of such drugs to an ineffective 
level. It has been shown that MDR1 mRNA levels are 
elevated in untreated, intrinsically drug resistant 
tumors including those derived from the colon, kidney, 
adrenal gland, liver and pancreas as well as some cancers 
at relapse after chemotherapy including breast 
cancer, neuroblastoma, ALL and nodular poorly differentiated 
lymphoma. Chemotherapeutic agents in clinical use to 
which multi-drug resistance has been observed include 
doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, 
duanomycin, etopiside, teniposide and actinomycin D. In the early 1980's it was discovered that 
multiple drug resistance tumor cells could be resensitized 
to
