<ABSTRACT>
A three-dimensional image special effect apparatus wherein operation for setting a 
parameter can be performed simpl
y and a special image can be moved smoothly to a 
distance only by a single manual operation of a track ball (21) or a rotary ring (22) is 

disclosed. A special image produced by an image special effect processing section (15) 
is manually operated in first and second three-dimensional directions (X, Y) by a track 

ball (21) and in a third three-dimensional direction (Z) by a rotary ring (22) disposed 
along an outer periphery of the track ball (21). A condition in which a parameter for 

determining a condition of the special image can be set is established and a setting menu 
for setting a parameter which determines a condition of the special image is produced 

by a CPU (11). Under the control of the CPU (11), a cursor for designating a 
parameter on the setting menu is operated by way of the track ball (21), and a value of 

the parameter is set by way of the rotary ring (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a three-dimensional
image special effect apparatus, and more particularly to
a three-dimensional image special effect apparatus
having a three-dimensional inputting apparatus.A three-dimensional image special effect
apparatus is used to obtain such a special effect as to,
for example, expand or contract or turn and move a
special image fitted in another image on a monitor. In
a three-dimensional image special effect apparatus of
the type mentioned, a three-dimensional inputting
apparatus such as a spherical track ball or a joy-stick
in the form of a lever is used to operate the special
image.A three-dimensional inputting apparatus which
employs a rotary ring in place of a track ball is also
known and disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Application No. Heisei 2-282818 and Japanese Utility
Model Laid-Open Application No. Heisei 2-143638, which 
correspond to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 512,860
filed April 23, 1990, now abandoned.By the way, various conditions of a special
image such as a size or a border of the special image
are given as parameters, and various effects can be
achieved by suitably setting such parameters. The
parameters are displayed on various menus, and for
example, a track ball is manually operated to move a
cursor on a menu to the position of a parameter and then
a value of the parameter is set by manual operation of
an inputting key such as a function key located
separately from the track ball.With the three-dimensional inputting apparatus
described above, since the track ball for operating the
cursor and the inputting key for setting a parameter are
provided separately from each other, it is impossible to
operate them at a time by one hand, and accordingly, a
parameter setting operation is cumbersome.EP-A-0 387 981 discloses the use of a track ball and a wheel for
setting parameters in a setting menu. The track ball sets the values
of the X and Y parameters and the wheel the value of the Z parameter
of functions such as location or rotation. The cursor designating the function on the setting menu is moved by way of the keyboard.It may be a possible idea to use a joy-stick as
an inputting key. Where a joy-stick is employed, since
a special image continues to move at a predetermined
speed in a selected direction only by tilting a lever,
operation is comparatively easy even to move a special
image to a distance. In contrast, where a track ball is employed, a
special image is operated by rotating the track ball,
and if rotation of the track ball is
