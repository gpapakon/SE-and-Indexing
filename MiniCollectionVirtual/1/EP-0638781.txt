<ABSTRACT>
In a calibration method carried out by means of a multicoordinator measuring machine (1) in accordance with Figure 1, in order to eliminate the frictional effects of the feeling system (6), a feeling movement is superimposed with a movement whose direction deviates from the original feeling direction.

A calibration procedure for measuring sensing systems (6) which are used with numerically
controlled devices in multi-coordinate measuring devices (1), through contacting calibration

surfaces (9, 10, 11) of a calibration gauge (3), characterized in that the following method steps
are carried out, in order to determine and compensate for the ratios of the contact forces in

different coordinate directions (X, Y, Z):

entering parameters of the measuring sensing system (6) in the control device,
entering parameters of the calibration gauge (3) in the control device,
contacting a calibration surface (11) of the calibration gauge (3), wherein the
predetermined contacting movement takes place in a plane which is defined by two

coordinate directions (X, Z; Y, Z) and causes a deflection of the sensing system (6) in two
coordinate directions (X, Z; Y, Z),
superimposing a movement deviating from this contacting movement on the predetermined
contacting movement,
determining the deflection of the measuring sensing system (6) in the two coordinate
directions (X, Z; Y, Z),
determining the ratio of the contact forces in the two coordinate directions (X, Z; Y, Z)
from the deflections of the sensing system (6) and forming correction factors,
entering the correction factors in the control device and
compensating automatically for the contact errors of the sensing system (6) caused by the
contact forces in the two coordinate directions (X, Z; Y, Z) through the control during the

subsequent operation.
A calibration procedure according to claim 1, characterized in that the movement superimposed
on the predetermined contacting movement is a linear movement which is at an angle to,

preferably orthogonal to the sensing direction.
A calibration procedure according to claim 1, characterized in that the movement superimposed
on the predetermined contacting movement is a vibrational movement.
A calibration procedure according to claim 1, characterized in that a conical region (11) of a bore
(8) of the calibration gauge (3) is contacted in the sensing. 
A calibration procedure according to claim 1, characterized in that an adjustment procedure with
the following method steps precedes the method steps:


a reference mark of the sensing system is traversed in at least one coordinate from the
starting position of the measuring sensing system,
a random measured value of the sensing system is cancelled out at the reference mark,
the measuring system returns to its starting position and
the distance from the reference mark to the starting position is stored in a memory.
