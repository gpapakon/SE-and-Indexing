<ABSTRACT>
An extrudable flexible material profile (1), for marking electric leads, cables, hoses and other elongate objects (12). The profile comprises a centre portion (4) oriented along the longitudinal axis of the profile. Locking means (3) extend in parallel with said longitudinal axis (13) at each side of the centre portion (4) which by mutual coupling-up are making it possible for the profile to form a closed hollow section. The material thickness of the profile is dimensioned for flexibility in the centre portion (4) and for rigidity in the lock means (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a marking module as defined in the first part of claim 1 having a 
band shaped profile of a flexible material for marking 
electrical leads, cables, hoses and other elongate objects, 
comprising a centre portion oriented along the longitudinal 
axis of the module and locking means extending in parallel 
with said longitudinal axis at each side of the centre 
portion. Such a marking module is known from DE-A-26 48 421. A procedure for marking of strips with the method described 
in the invention is known before, i.e. to use an electronic 
thermo print head and lamination technology, which is used 
here in a new application. The device is also known before, 
but is in this application used for direct marking and 
manufacturing of a marking module. It is also known devices 
and procedures for marking elongate material by means of 
electric hand tools or machines. It is even known to mark 
electric cables by threading differently coloured and/or 
already marked sleeves onto cables. These sleeves are kept 
in boxes with different compartment beside the installer and 
are clamped or threaded onto the cable. Two examples of 
this procedure are described in SE 7804949-1 and US 
4,641,443 which discloses various mark profiles attachable 
from the side. The marking systems mentioned above are flexible but 
time-consuming to mount. It is also known to use already 
marked sleeves supporting the whole identity number, these 
are less time consuming to mount but are not flexible due to 
that they must be ordered in advance according to 
specification.  
 The marking module as disclosed in DE-A-26 48 421 can 
easily be mounted on a cable, but 
it is not adaptable to a large number of cable diameters. The purpose of present invention is to provide 
a marking 
module that combines the advantages of 
the known main types, without incorporating their drawbacks. For this object, the invention is characterized in that the 
module is foldable at fold notches located between the 
center portion and the locking means, and in that the 
profile thickness is selected so as to provide for 
flexibility in the centre portion and for rigidity at the 
end portions and for a substantially triangular shape of the 
module with the locking means being closed, and which triangular shape 
is flexibly adaptable to the cross section of the object being 
encompassed by the module. The invention will be described hereinafter with reference 
to an embodiment which is shown in the enclosed drawings, in 
which

<CLAIMS>
A marking module of a flexible material having a band shaped profile (1) in an unfolded condition 
for marking electrical leads, cables, 

hoses and other elongate objects (12), comprising a centre 
portion (4) oriented along the longitudinal axis of the 

module and locking means (3) extending in parallel with said 
longitudinal axis (13) at each side of the centre portion 

(4), 
characterized
 in
 
that the module is foldable at fold notches (2) located 

between the center portion (4) and the locking means (3), 
and in that the profile thickness is selected so as to 

provide for flexibility in the centre portion and for 
rigidity at the end portions and for a substantially 

triangular shape of the module with the locking means (3) 
being closed, and which triangular shape is flexibly adaptable to the 

cross section of the object being encompassed by the module. 
A marking module according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that shank portions (11) 
extend in parallel with said longitudinal axis (13) between 

the centre portion (4) and each locking means (3). 
A marking module according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the lock means (3) are 
designed so that the size of the closed loop formed by the 

centre portion (4) and the locking means is adjustable by 
locking in several steps. 
A marking module according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the centre 
portion (4), holds the marking symbols. 
A marking module according to claim 4,
characterized
 in that at least the centre 
portion (4) is transparent, that the marking symbols are  

 
mounted onto the inside of the centre portion, and that a 

protective film (5) with a colour contrasting the marking 
symbols is mounted onto the inside of the centre portion. 
A marking module according to claim 4,
characterized
 in that the marking symbols are 
placed on a transparent protective film that is laminated on 

the outer surface of the centre portion (4) which has a 
contrasting colour. 
A marking module according to any of preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the centre portion (4) is 
primarily plane when the locking means (3) is in an inactive 

position.
