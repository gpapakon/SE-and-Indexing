<ABSTRACT>
A volume ratio of conductive material to a voice 
coil is improved by using a tape coil wire, and a 

magnetic efficiency of the voice coil is improved by 
attaching magnetic material to conductive material of the 

coil wire. A tape coil wire having a predetermined width 
is wound about a voice coil bobbin to form a voice coil. 

The winding start portion of the voice coil is soldered 
to the exposed area of the voice coil bobbin. A 

projection of the voice coil bobbin forms the winding 
start terminal. A folded portion of the winding end 

portion of the voice coil forms the winding end terminal. 
Input signal lead wires on the damper are electrically 

connected to the winding start and end terminals to drive 
the cone paper by the voice coil.
