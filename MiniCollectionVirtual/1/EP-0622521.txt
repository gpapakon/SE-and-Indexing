<ABSTRACT>
A combination packer/safety valve assembly (28) is 
connectable to the bottom end of a tubing string (36) and 

lowerable therewith into the casing string portion of a gas 
storage well to control the upward flow through the casing 

string (16) of pressurized gas stored in a subterranean 
cavern (12) below the casing string (16). The assembly 

comprises a body portion lowerable into the casing string 
(16) and having a normally closed first internal passage 

(128,52) through which, when opened, pressurized well fluid 
may internally traverse said body portion (30), and a second 

internal passage for receiving a pressurized control fluid 
(42) from a source thereof; first means (150,136) carried by 

said body portion (30) and operative to open said normally 
closed first passage (128,52) during the presence of a 

predetermined first control fluid pressure within said 
second internal passage; and second means (38,40) carried by 

said body portion (30) and operative to anchor and seal said 
body portion (30) within the casing string (16) in response 

to a predetermined second control fluid pressure created 
within said second internal passage and different from said 

predetermined first control fluid pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
combination packer/safety valve assembly for flow control in 
a subterranean well. Previously retrieved natural gas is often stored 
in underground cavern structures, such as salt caverns or 
abandoned mine shafts, for later use. To effect such 
storage, a gas storage well is constructed by extending a 
casing string from a surface wellhead structure downwardly 
through the earth to the subterranean cavern, and then 
pumping the gas downwardly through the casing string into 
the cavern. To keep the pressurized gas delivered to the 
cavern from simply forcing its way up the casing string when 
the pumping pressure is terminated, it is necessary to 
"shut-in" the well until retrieval of some or all of the 
stored gas is needed. To effect this well shut-in, a normally closed 
safety valve is typically installed in the casing string and 
sealed therein using a packing structure. When it is 
desired to retrieve some of the pressurized gas stored in 
the cavern, the valve is simply opened to allow the 
pressurized gas to flow upwardly through the temporarily  
 
opened valve, into the wellhead structure through the casing 
string portion above the opened valve, and to a suitable 
receiving structure through an outlet pipe connected to the 
wellhead. To terminate upward flow of the stored gas, the 
safety valve is returned to its normally closed position. Conventional safety valves, and their associated 
packer structures, used to shut-in gas storage wells in the 
manner generally described above are subject to several well 
known problems, limitations and disadvantages. For example, 
the opening of the casing-installed safety valve is 
typically effected using a vertical valve opening rod 
extending through the casing string, connected at its lower 
end to the movable valve closure element, and connected at 
its upper end to a pressure-actuated piston disposed in the 
wellhead structure and used to downwardly drive the rod to 
open the safety valve. The use of this conventional piston/rod mechanical 
valve operating structure has two primary limitations. 
First, the movable valve element in the safety valve is 
typically spring-biased upwardly toward its normally closed 
position. When it is desired to permit this movable valve 
element to return to its normally closed position, its 
biasing spring must move not only the valve element 
upwardly, but the actuating rod member as well. Since the 
weight of the rod is directly proportional to its length, 
and the

<CLAIMS>
A combination packer/safety valve assembly (28) for use 
in controlling upward flow of a pressurized well fluid 

through a casing string portion of a subterranean well (10), 
which assembly comprises a body portion (30) lowerable into 

the casing string (16) and having a normally closed first 
internal passage (128,52) through which, when opened, 

pressurized well fluid may internally traverse said body 
portion (30), and a second internal passage for receiving a 

pressurized control fluid (42) from a source thereof; first 
means (150,136) carried by said body portion (30) and 

operative to open said normally closed first passage 
(128,52) during the presence of a predetermined first 

control fluid pressure within said second internal passage; 
and second means (38,40) carried by said body portion (30) 

and operative to anchor and seal said body portion (30) 
within the casing string (16) in response to a predetermined 

second control fluid pressure created within said second 
internal passage and different from said predetermined first 

control fluid pressure. 
An assembly according to claim 1, which is 
arranged so that said predetermined second control fluid 

pressure is greater than said predetermined first control 
fluid pressure. 
An assembly according to claim 2, further 
comprising third means (74) carried by said body portion 

(30) and operative to release and unseal said body portion 
(30) from the casing string (16) in response to a 

predetermined third control fluid pressure created within 
said second internal passage and greater than said 

predetermined second control fluid pressure. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said 
first means (150,136) include a main valve member (136) 

interposed in said first internal passage (128, 52), first 
biasing means (138) for biasing said main valve member (136) 

toward a closed position within said first internal passage, 
and main piston means (150) pressure operable by control 

fluid (42) in said second internal passage to engage and 
forcibly open said main valve member (136) against well 

fluid pressure forces acting on said main valve member in 
opposition to movement thereof away from said closed 

position thereof; and wherein said assembly further 
comprises equalizing means (154), operative in response to 

control fluid pressure in said second internal passage, for 
reducing the main piston means force required to be exerted 

on said main valve member (136) to move it away from said 
closed position thereof. 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein said 
equalizing means (154) include an equalizing valve member 

(144) interposed in said first internal passage, means (148)

closed position thereof, and equalizing piston means (154) 
carried by said main piston means (150) for control pressure

manner driving it away from said closed position thereof. 
The use of a combination packer/safety valve 
assembly as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, in a well to 

control upward flow of a pressurized well fluid.
