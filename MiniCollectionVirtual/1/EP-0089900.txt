<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns new N-[(2-oxo-1-­
pyrrolidinyl)acetyl]
 piperazines of the following formula: 

 
wherein

 
R represents hydrogen or an alkyl group which contains 

1 to 3 carbon atoms which can be arranged as straight or 
branched chain and

 
R′ represents an allyl, cinnamyl or p-methoxybenzyl 

group,
 

as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition 
salts. 
These piperazine derivatives are useful as drugs, espe­
cially in the treatment of cerebrovascular disturbances in the 

elderly.

Title
New W-[(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetyl]piperazines, the methods of producing such new compounds and their salts as well as   pharmaceutical    preparations   gor    therapeutic use.containing these compounds or salts.


   
This invention relates to N- ( (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetyl] -    piperazines which are of use as medicines and as intermediates for the productions of medicines. This invention also relates to methods of producing these novel compounds. 
More specifically, this invention relates to piperazines of the formula I
EMI1.1     
  
 wherein
R represents hydrogen or an alkyl group which contains 1 to 3
 carbon atoms which can be arranged as straight or branched
 chain and   R    represents an   ally.    cinn-amyl or p-methoxybenzyl group.


The following are included as biologically acceptable :salts: acetates, citrates, succinates, maleates, ascorbates-, hydro- chlorides, sulfates, etc. These salts may be   prepared    by known salification methods.


Preferred compounds in this invention are:
N-[(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)acetyl]-N'-allylpiperazine
N-   [(2-oxo-l-pyrrolidinyl)acetyl]      -N-cinnamylpiperazine    and
N-[(2-oxo-pyrrolidinyl)acetyl]-N'-(p-methoxybenzyl)piperazine
The N- [   (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetyl3    piperazines of the present.


invention may be produced by means of the following methods:
I. By   ammirzolysis    of an ester1 illustrated as follows:  
EMI3.1     
    wherein   
 R and   R'have    the same meanings as above and   R represents    an   alkyl    radical which contains 1 or 2 carbon atoms or an aryl
 radical with or without substitution.  


The   method s    characteristic is in the use of a stoichiometric quantity, or an excess (1 to 5 mol) of formula II ester in relation to amine III. The formula IV alcohol formed is gradually eliminated by distillation at normal or reduced pressure. In this last case a .14 mm vacuum is enough. The   reaction's      temperature    depends on the type of ester used; in the case   R      represents    a substituted or non-substituted phenyl radical, the working temperature should be room temperature or slightly higher, for example 800 C.
In the case R' represents alkyl radicals the working temperature should be   between    100 and 1900 C.   Reaction    times should be of 6 to 14 hours.   Formulas    compounds are isolated as free bases by distillation or crystallization. In the case when excess formula   II-ester    is   used,    it is -desirable to eliminate this ester by previous distillation in a vacuum.
