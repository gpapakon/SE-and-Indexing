<ABSTRACT>
A tappet for use in an internal combustion engine 
comprises Al-alloy base material and a sprayed layer 

on the outer surface which is in sliding relationship 
with a cylinder head. The sprayed layer is made of Fe-alloy 

which comprises not more than 0.1% by weight of 
C, 0.6-2.0% by weight of Mn and the balance of Fe, thereby 

providing high hardness, high toughness and low cost. 
The sprayed layer may further contain 0.1-1.0% by weight 

of Si.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tappets (which term includes valve 
lifters) for use in reciprocating internal combustion engines. In a known tappet for an internal combustion engine, for 
example, carburizing hardening has been applied to a tappet body 
made of steel or cast iron. Recently, there have been 
disclosures of the use of coated light alloys in Japanese utility 
Model Laid-Open Pub. No. 63-174508; NiP alloy plated metal in 
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Pub. No. 62-138803; and Fe-C 
sprayed metal in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Pub. No. 1-315607. However, in the known steel or cast-iron tappets or light 
alloy tappets which are subject to surface treatment, there are 
disadvantages which could not be sufficiently overcome, such as 
increase in mass in steel or cast iron tappets; increase in cost 
in tappets as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Pub. 
Nos. 63-174508 and 62-138803; and decrease in toughness of a 
sprayed layer as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Pub. No. 
1-315607. US 4 909 198 describes a valve lifter for an internal 
combustion engine comprising a light alloy base material made of 
aluminium alloy with a sprayed coating formed on a sliding 
peripheral surface of the valve lifter, the sprayed coating being 
formed of Fe-alloy which has a carbon content of 0.1% or more. In view of the disadvantages, the object of the present 
invention is to provide a light-alloy tappet in an internal 
combustion engine having low cost, a wear-resistant sprayed layer 
and high toughness.  
 To attain the object of the present invention, there is 
provided a tappet for use in a reciprocating internal combustion 
engine, the tappet comprising light-alloy base material made of 
Al-alloy; and a sprayed layer made of Fe-alloy which comprises 
not more than 0.1% by weight of C, 0.6-2.0% by weight of Mn, 0.5-1.0% 
by weight of Si and the balance of Fe. Preferably, the Mn 
content in the sprayed layer is 1.0-1.4% by weight. Preferably, 
the C content in the sprayed layer is 0.07-0.08% by weight. The present invention is concerned with a tappet as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Pub. No. 1-315607, and the 
function of the present invention will be described compared 
therewith. Claims in the publication define an Fe-C sprayed 
layer which contains more than 0.1% by weight of C and having 
hardness of more than Hv300. The percentage of each element will 
hereinafter refer to "by weight". But the sprayed layer which 
consists of Fe and C seldom attains toughness of more than Hv300 
by

<CLAIMS>
A tappet for use in an internal combustion engine, 
comprising a light alloy base material made of Al-alloy; and a 

sprayed layer on an outer surface which is, in use, in sliding 
relationship with a cylinder head, the sprayed layer being formed 

of Fe-alloy which comprises not more than 0.1% by weight of C; 
characterized in that the Fe-alloy also comprises 0.6-2.0% by 

weight of Mn; 0.5-1.0% by weight of Si with the balance of Fe. 
A tappet as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the Mn content in 
the sprayed layer is 1.0-1.4% by weight. 
A tappet as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the C content 
in the sprayed layer is 0.07-0.8% by weight.
