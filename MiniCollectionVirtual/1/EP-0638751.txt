Sealed and flexible tube (pipe) (1) formed by spiral-winding a shaped strip (2) about a longitudinal axis (A), the shaped strip comprising a first, corrugated wing (7) and a second, approximately flat, wing (8), the said second wing (8), after winding, covering the first wing (7) inside the tube (1). According to the invention the shaped strip (2) includes a third, approximately flat, wing (9) located between the first (7) and the second (8) wings and connected to the second wing (8) by a shoulder (10) formed such that the third wing (9), after winding, forms a spiral of larger diameter than that of the second wing (8).
