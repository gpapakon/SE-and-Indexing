Use of ecologically compatible, and more particularly 
of biologically degradable, oils having flash points of 

above 80 °C for washing mineral oil-loaded drill cuttings 
prior to the disposal thereof by off-shore and/or on-sho
re 
deposition. 
The use according to claim 1, characterized in that 
aerobically and/or anaerobically degradable low-viscosity 

oils are employed which are also suitable for being used as 
a mixture component of the continuous oil phase of W/O 

invert drilling fluids. 
The use according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that washing liquids selected among the oleophilic compounds 

from the group consisting of monocarboxylic acid 
esters, polycarboxylic acid esters, ethers, alcohols, including 

the partial ethers thereof, and/or carbonic acid 
esters (O-functionalized wash oils) are employed in at 

least one final washing step prior to the waste disposal of 
said cuttings. 
The use according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that O-functionalized wash oils having pour points and 

setting points of below 0 °C, and preferably of below 
-5 °C, and especially of below -15 °C are employed which 

are flowable and pumpable in the temperature range of from 
0 °C to 5 °C and which possess preferred Brookfield (RVT) 

viscosities of not more than 60 mPa·s, and especially of 
below 45 mPa·s.  

 
The use according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that, if wash oils which are potentially susceptible to 

hydrolysis, and especially esters of mono- and/or polycarboxylic 
acids, are used, only those esters are used 

which do not cause any toxicological, and especially no 
inhalation-toxicological, danger to be induced upon a 

partial saponification in practical use. 
The use according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that wash oils are used which at least in part, and 

preferably at least predominantly are composed on an ester-and/or 
ether-base. 
The use according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that ester-based wash oils are used which have been 

selected from at least one of the following subclasses: 

a) Esters of C₁₋₅-monocarboxylic acids and mono- and/or 
polyfunctional alcohols, whereof the moieties of 

monohydric alcohols comprise at least 6 carbon atoms 
and preferably at least 8 carbon atoms and the polyhydric 

alcohols preferably have from 2 to 6 carbon 
atoms in the molecule, 
b) Esters of monocarboxylic acids of synthetic and/or 
natural origin comprising from 6 to 16 carbon atoms, 

and more specifically esters of aliphatic saturated 
monocarboxylic acids and mono- and/or polyfunctional 

alcohols of the kind mentioned in a), 
c) Esters of olefinically mono- and/or polyunsaturated 
monocarboxylic acids having at least 16, and 

especially 16 to 24 carbon atoms and especially 
monofunctional straight-chain and/or branched 

alcohols. 
The use according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that ether-based wash oils are used which contain ethers, 

mixed ethers and ether mixtures of monofunctional alcohols 
having at least 6 carbon atoms, wherein also mixed ethers  

 
with incorporated moieties of polyhydric alcohols can be 

used. 
The use according to claims 1 to 6 and 8, characterized 
in that ether-based wash oils are used that are 

derived at least in part, and preferably at least predominantly, 
from straight-chain monofunctional alcohols, 

the ethers of the respective mono-alcohols having from 8 to 
12 carbon atoms and/or the mixed ethers thereof with di- to 

tetrahydric alcohols having straight-chain and/or branched 
carbon chains being particularly preferred. 
The use according to claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the drill cuttings removed from the mineral oil-based 

drilling fluids are virtually cleared of non-degradable 
mineral oil portions by using the biologically degradable 

O-functionalized wash oils, wherein the wash oil contaminated 
with mineral oil, at least in part, is preferably 

added to the oil-based drilling fluid and thereby disposed 
of. 
The use according to claims 1 to 10, characterized in 
that the operation of washing the drill cuttings contaminated 

with the oil-based drilling fluid is carried out in 
more than one step, wherein also mineral oil-based wash 

oils may be used in at least one washing step. 
The use according to claims 1 to 11, characterized in 
that at least one washing step is carried out with the use 

or concomitant use of mineral oil fractions which are 
suitable in composing drilling fluids of especially the 

type of W/O invert sweeping muds and that in the course 
thereof the contaminated wash oils, once removed from the 

cuttings, are admixed to the drilling fluid, while the 
drill cuttings thus pre-cleaned is after-cleaned with the 

biologically degradable O-functionalized wash oils.  
 
The use according to claims 1 to 12, characterized in 
that the procedure of washing the drill cuttings makes use 

of cocurrent streams and/or of counter-current streams of 
the wash oil and drilling mud, respectively, and that the 

working temperature is up to about 100 °C, while washing 
temperatures of from about 35 °C to about 80 °C may be 

preferred. 
The use according to claims 1 to 13 characterized in 
that wash oils containing emulsifiers - preferably those of 

the W/O type - are used.
