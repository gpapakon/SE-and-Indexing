<ABSTRACT>
A scale plate arrangement is adapted to be attached to a 
machine tool for detecting, for example, position and velocity of 

an object. The scale plate arrangement includes a scale-plate 
base and a scale plate which has a scale thereon. The scale plate 

is welded to the scale-plate base. With this, it is not necessary to 
use an adhesive or a fixing member to attach the scale plate to 

the scale-plate base. In case that the scale plate has a magnetic 
scale and that the scale-plate base is made of a magnetic 

material, the scale-plate base is formed with a recess which is 
positioned under the magnetic scale. With this, magnetic 

influence of the scale-plate base on the magnetic scale can be 
prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scale plate arrangement
in which a scale plate is attached to a machine tool or the like
through a scale-plate base for detecting position, velocity and the
like of an object.Hitherto, various scale plate arrangements have been
proposed. In case that a scale plate is attached to a machine tool
or the like, the scale plate is not directly attached to a machine
tool because the scale plate is thin in thickness and thus
insufficient in rigidity. In fact, the scale plate is usually attached
to a scale-plate base which is made of iron, stainless steel or the
like and is higher than the scale plate in rigidity. Then, the scale-plate
base having thereon the scale plate is attached to a machine
tool.There have been proposed several conventional ways to
attach a scale plate to a scale-plate base. For example, there is
provided a proposal in which a scale plate is directly attached to
a scale-plate base by means of an adhesive. As to the material of
the scale-plate base, it is preferable to use iron or a material
which has the same temperature expansion coefficient as that of
iron. Such material including iron has magnetism. Therefore, in
case that the scale plate is a magnetic scale plate, magnetism of
the scale-plate base has a bad influence on a magnetic scale
(marks) of the magnetic scale plate. In view of this, there is
provided another proposal in which a non-magnetic material
plate made of brass or the like is sandwiched between the scale
plate and the scale-plate base so as to prevent the above-mentioned
bad influence. In fact, the non-magnetic material
plate is attached to the scale-plate base by means of an adhesive,
and then the scale plate is attached to the non-magnetic material
plate by means of an adhesive. However, the above-mentioned
two conventional ways to attach a scale plate to a scale-plate base 
by means of an adhesive have a drawback. That is, until now, an
adhesive which is satisfactory with respect to all the necessary
conditions in terms of, for example, resistance against a severe
environment, temperature characteristics and curing time has not
been available. Such adhesive tends to lower accuracy of the
scale plate arrangement. Furthermore, the non-magnetic
material plate is generally different from iron in temperature
expansion coefficient. Therefore, the temperature change lowers
accuracy of the scale plate arrangement having the non-magnetic
material plate.There is provided still another proposal in which a scale
plate is attached to a scale-plate
