<ABSTRACT>
An interactive graphical attitude maneuver planning 
computer system for planning satellite attitude maneuvers 

allows a user to immediately see where star trackers are 
pointing when the attitude and orbital position of a satellite 

are varied on the computer system. The computer system 
includes a graphics display on which the celestial sphere, 

centered at the satellite rather than the Earth, is projected. 
The horizontal axis of the display measures the Right 

Ascension angle, while the vertical axis measures the 
Declination angle. The display shows, in addition to stars, 

the region of the sky occluded by the Earth and "interference 
regions" around the moon, sun and planets, in which the star 

trackers should not point, and the fields of view of the star 
trackers. The attitude of the satellite is adjusted by means 

of graphical slider bars which vary the roll, pitch and yaw 
angle rotations. As the slider bars are adjusted, the star 

trackers move across the sky, and the stars pass through their 
fields of view, making it immediately obvious to the user 

where the star trackers are pointing, whether or not they will 
detect 
certain stars, and whether or not they will point too 
closely to the Earth, moon, sun, or planets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a tool for
simulating the motions of a satellite in a visual and
interactive manner and, more particularly, to a computer
system that displays the sky from the point of view of a
satellite along with the fields of view of the satellite's
star sensors. The invention allows the user to vary
interactively the motions of the satellite so that a star-sensor-based
attitude maneuver can be planned.Many satellites use star sensors to determine their
attitude, or orientation in space. Stars are identified by
comparing their positions in the sensor with known positions
obtained from a star catalog. The positions of the identified
stars in the fields of view of the star sensors are used to
determine the attitude of the satellite. The process of
identifying the first few stars in the star sensors is called
"stellar acquisition." It is necessary not only after
separation from the launch vehicle, but also after a hardware
or software error when the attitude of the satellite must be
determined using little or no prior attitude information.There are a number-of star identification algorithms, the
simplest of which searches the star catalog for the star
closest to the unidentified star. This and other algorithms
require that an initial attitude estimate be derived from
coarse attitude sensors such as magnetometers or sun sensors
before beginning the star identification. Due to the
coarseness of this initial estimate, which may be accurate to
within only a few degrees, the satellite's onboard software 
could easily confuse one star with another. For this reason a
small star catalog is used consisting of bright and widely
separated "acquisition stars." Because there are typically no
more than thirty acquisition stars, they are easily missed by
the star sensors.The problem of stellar acquisition consists of planning
attitude maneuvers to position the star sensors so they will
detect acquisition stars. The star sensors must not be
pointed too closely to the sun, moon or Earth, because they
are easily damaged when pointed too closely (within twenty or
thirty degrees) to a bright object. They also should not be
pointed near planets, which can be mistaken for stars. To
complicate matters, the Earth occludes different portions of
the sky as the satellite orbits.While star identification is usually performed by the
onboard software of the satellite, stellar acquisition
maneuvers are usually planned by ground-based human analysts.
This planning has proven to be a difficult and

An interactive graphical attitude maneuver planning
computer system for planning satellite attitude maneuvers

comprising:

a graphics display comprising at least a first window
displaying a map of the celestial sphere as seen from a

satellite and a second window displaying graphical slider
bars for varying roll, pitch and yaw angles of the

satellite, graphical "RUN" and "STOP" buttons, and text
entry windows for entering date and time;
a computer running an operating system supporting a
windowing function responsive to user initiated events

for executing functions to process said events in an
interactive manner, said computer system also running an

application program on said operating system and
windowing function to compute an attitude matrix,

determine an orientation of at least one star sensor and
compute sky and star sensor field of view displays; and
