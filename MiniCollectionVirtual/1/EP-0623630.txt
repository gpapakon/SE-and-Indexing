<ABSTRACT>
Water-in-oil polymer emulsions, characterised in that they contain water-soluble polymers having a mean particle size of from 0.1 to 20 mu m emulsified in a continuous oil phase comprising at least 50% by weight of an oil of vegetable or animal origin with the aid of from 0.5 to 15% by weight, based on the total emulsion, of an emulsifier mixture comprising   a) from 5 to 95% by weight of a block or graft copolymer of the formula (A-COO)m-B, in which A is a hydrophobic polymer having a molecular weight of 
>
 500 g/mol based on a poly(hydroxycarboxylic acid), B is a bifunctional hydrophilic polymer having a molecular weight of 
>
 500 g/mol based on a polyalkylene oxide, and m is at least 2, and b) from 5 to 95% by weight of another water-in-oil emulsifier having a molecular weight of 
<
 1000 g/mol, and optionally up to 10% by weight, based on the total emulsion, of a wetting agent having an HLB value of greater than 10, process for the preparation of the water-in-oil polymer emulsions, and the use of these emulsions as flocculents for effluent treatment and sewage sludge dewatering and as dewatering and retention agents in papermaking.

<CLAIMS>
A water-in-oil polymer emulsion which contains 
water-soluble polymers having a mean particle size of 

from 0.1 to 20 µm emulsified in a continuous oil phase, 
at least 50% by weight of which consists of an oil of 

vegetable or animal origin, with the aid of from 0.5 to 
15% by weight, based on the total emulsion, of an emulsifier 

mixture comprising 

(a) from 5 to 95% by weight of a block or graft copolymer 
of the formula (A-COO)
m
-B, where A is a hydrophobic 
polymer having a molecular weight of 


>
 500 g/mol and based on a polyhydroxycarboxylic 
acid, B is a bifunctional hydrophilic polymer having 

a molecular weight of 
>
 500 g/mol and based on a 
polyalkylene oxide and m is at least 2, and 
(b) from 5 to 95% by weight of another water-in-oil 
emulsifier having a molecular weight of 


<
 1000 g/mol, 
 
and may contain up to 10% by weight, based on the total 

emulsion, of a wetting agent having an HLB value of more 
than 10. 
A water-in-oil polymer emulsion as claimed in 
claim 1, wherein the oil phase consists of an oil of 

vegetable or animal origin. 
A process for the preparation of a water-in-oil 
polymer emulsion as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 

water-soluble monoethylenically unsaturated monomers and 
water are emulsified with an emulsifier mixture comprising 


(a) from 5 to 95% by weight of a block or graft copolymer 
of the formula (A-COO)
m
-B, where A is a hydrophobic  
 

polymer having a molecular weight of 

>
 500 g/mol and based on a polyhydroxycarboxylic 
acid, B is a bifunctional hydrophilic polymer having 

a molecular weight of 
>
 500 g/mol and based on a 
polyalkylene oxide and m is at least 2, and 
(b) from 5 to 95% by weight of another water-in-oil 
emulsifier having a molecular weight of 


<
 1000 g/mol, 
 
in an oil, at least 50% by weight of which is of vegetable 

or animal origin, and the monomers of the emulsion 
are polymerized in the presence of free radical 

initiators and in the presence or absence of wetting 
agents having an HLB value of more than 10 to give 

particles having a mean particle size of from 0.1 to 20 
µm or, if required, the stated wetting agents are added 

to the water-in-oil polymer emulsion after completion of 
the polymerization. 
Use of a water-in-oil polymer emulsion as claimed 
in claim 1 or 2 as a flocculant for wastewater treatment 

and sewage sludge dewatering. 
Use of a water-in-oil polymer emulsion as claimed 
in claim 1 or 2 as a drainage or retention aid in 

papermaking.
