<ABSTRACT>
A Leaky Antenna for use in a Personal Handy Phone system or in a 
Personal Communications System (hereinafter refered to as a PHS or PCS) 

or in DECT, which are operated under the FDMA/TDD, TDMA/TDD or CDMA 
scheme, and within a closed area such as within a building and/or under 

the ground, where the RF propagations are sometimes prevented by walls, 
ceilings, and/or other obstacles. 
The Leaky Antenna is invented to sprinkle the RF signals into all 

the corners of system serving area even under the above conditions. The 
Leaky Antenna is defined as Antenna which has a common metal plane, a 

plurality of radiation element, and RF transmission means to couple the 
RF signals partially and to sprinkle them into the closed areas. 
Moreover, said Leaky Antenna is installed under the ceiling within 
a building, or an under ground mole with glue or other fixing means. If 

the Leaky Antenna is very thin and covered of the same color, it will be 
attractive from the interior designing view point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates mobile communications systems and generally 
to the field of sprinkling facilities for RF (Radio-Frequency) signals 
which are transmitted/received to/from one or more FDMA (Frequency 
Division Multiple Access/Time Division Duplex) or TDMA/TDD (Time 
Division Multiple Access/Time Division Duplex) or CDMA (Code Division 
Multiple Access) base stations, and more specifically relates to the 
facilities to sprinkle the combined FDMA/TDD or TDMA/TDD or CDMA RF 
carriers for enhancing the serving area of PHS (Personal Handy Phone 
System) or PCS (Personal Communications System) which serving area is 
sometime limited by some obstructions such as walls and/or ceilings that 
block the RF signals. When the Leaky Antenna is applied for combining one or more FDMA/ 
TDD or TDMA/TDD or CDMA carriers and sprinkled them within a plurality 
of the micro-cell serving area, the traffic capacity (consequently the 
efficiency of channel usage) of the RF carriers is greatly improved, 
compared to when these FDMA/TDD or TDMA/TDD or CDMA carriers are not 
combined and operated as an independent micro-cell serving area. PHS i.e. PCS or PCN (Personal Communications Network) have recently 
been introduced in a number of outdoor and/or indoor areas to provide 
wireless public telephone coverages for people who need to have access 
to public telephones from either inside or outside of their offices or 
who are otherwise inconvenient to approach to the public telephones that 
are hard-wired to a PBX and/or a central switching office over 
conventional public telephone lines.  In a PHS or a PCS, an area is divided into a plurality of small 
regions, or "micro-cells", each of which is covered by very low power 
(10mW) transmitters. Currently, PHS or PCS services are being provided 
on the 1.9GHz frequency bands and operated in either the FDMA/TDD or 
TDMA/TDD or CDMA schemes wherein the transmitter and receiver set share 
the same frequency carrier by dividing the time domain into two 
divisions. One of the divisions is used for "down-link" transmissions 
from a base station to the subscribers. The "micro-cell site" is the 
location of the antenna from which the transmissions are propagated for 
the micro-cell. Another time division is used for "up-link" 
transmissions from the subscribers within the micro-cell for reception 
by the base station receiver, currently, a stand-alone base station is 
provided centrally within the micro-cell site. Each frequency carrier 
assigned with 300 kilohertz for PHS and
