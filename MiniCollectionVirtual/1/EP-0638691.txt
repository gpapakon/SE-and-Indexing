<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide an 
attachment heavy duty shear of reduced weight. This 

shear has a single-row upper jaw (4) and a single-row lower 
jaw (1), with the upper jaw being driven by a built-in 

hydraulic cylinder (5a) to open and close with respect to the 
lower jaw. The forward end of the lower jaw has a 

7-configured guide member for precluding a lateral 
displacement of the upper jaw in shearing. This construction 

provides for reduced overall weight and positive 
grip and shearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heavy duty
shear for use in the demolition of buildings and other
structures according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a shear is known from US-A-5,187,868.In the demolition of reinforced concrete buildings,
scrap steel, chemical plant equipment made of
alloy steel or the like, it is common practice to
employ a heavy duty shear mounted on the arm of a power
shovel. For example, the specification of United
States Patent 4, 519, 135 discloses the shear illustrated
in Fig. 4. This shear comprises an upper jaw 4
and a lower jaw 1 juxtaposed in operative association
about a pivotal shaft so that the upper jaw 4 may swing
vertically to open and close with respect to the lower
jaw 1. As a load is gripped between said upper jaw 4
and lower jaw 1 and the upper jaw 4 is closed by
thrusting the piston rod of a hydraulic cylinder 5, the
load is shorn by the jaws 1,4. To secure an expanded
space between the upper jaw 4 and lower jaw 1 in an
appromixate center thereof, each of the jaws is recessed
away from the other so as to prevent a forward slide
of the gripped load. Moreover, the upper jaw 4 is
constituted as a single-row element and the lower jaw 1 
as an element formed in a couple of rows in such a
manner that the forward part of the upper jaw 4 may
swing down into the space between the two rows of lower
jaw 1. The members of lower jaw 1 corresponding to
said two rows are provided with a front cross member 6
interconnecting the forward ends of said lower jaw
members to preclude a lateral expansion of the space
between the rows. The lateral sides of upper and lower
jaws 1,4 which are to face each other are provided with
a plurality of cutters 7, 7a, 8, 9, respectively.
Further disposed on the lateral sides of upper jaw 4
and lower jaw 1 which are opposite to the sides provided
with said cutters 7, 7a, 8, 9 are wear plates 10
and 11, respectively, for precluding a lateral displacement
of the upper jaw 4 in shearing.However, since the lower jaw of this shear is
formed in a couple of rows and the upper and lower jaws
1, 4 are provided with wear plates 10, 11, respectively,
as mentioned above, the overall weight of the shear
is great and, therefore, a fairly large power shovel is
required for mounting of the shear.Meanwhile, Japanese Tokkyo Kokai Koho S-56-49273
discloses a heavy duty shear comprising a cylinder
housing dismountably secured to a power shovel arm
through a swivel device and a pair of cutter bodies 
rotatably supported about a pivotal shaft on said
cylinder housing,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A heavy duty shear for rotational mounting, as an
attachment, at the free end of a construction machine arm, the

heavy duty shear comprising a stationary lower jaw (1) having a
first cutter (8,9), a movable upper jaw (4) having a second

cutter (7), and a cylinder housing (12) with a hydraulic
cylinder (5a) therein, the lower jaw (1) extending from the

cylinder housing (12) and the hydraulic cylinder (5a) extending
transverse with respect to the lower jaw (1), the upper jaw (4)

being a single-row member with an intermediate portion
supported by a pivotal shaft (3) mounted on the cylinder

housing (12), the upper jaw (4) having a rear end portion
connected to the hydraulic cylinder (5a); and a forward portion

with the second cutter (7) thereon,
characterized in that

the lower jaw (1) is a single row member having a front end
element (6) with an attached end and a free end, the front end

element (6) being in spaced relation to and extending parallel
with respect to the pivotal shaft (3) on which the upper jaw

(4) is pivoted; an engaging member (23) to which the attached
end of the front end element (6) is attached so as to be

cantilevered with respect to the engaging member (23), the
engaging member (23) extending parallel to the cutters (7,8,9)

of the upper and lower jaws (4,1) and cooperating with the
front end element (6) to define a space opening laterally of

the engaging member (23) in the direction in which the pivotal
shaft (3) and front end element (6) extend as well as opening

perpendicular to the direction in which the pivotal shaft (3)
and front end element (6) extend, the movable upper jaw (4)

having a forward part which is received in the space when the
jaws are closed. 
The heavy duty shear of claim 1 further including a
smooth, curved wall portion (24) extending from the engaging

member (23) at a location spaced from the front end element
(6); the smooth, curved wall portion (24) facing the front end

element (6) with the space being defined by the front end (6)
element, the engaging portion (23) and the smooth curved wall

portion (24).
The heavy duty shear of claim 2, wherein the smooth curved
wall portion (24) extends beyond the front end element (6) in

the direction of the laterial opening.
