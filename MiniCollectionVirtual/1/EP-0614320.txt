<ABSTRACT>
A television signal determination circuit (1⊘) is 
included in a color circuit. During a burst period, a 

color signal through a 9⊘° phase-shifter (28) is 
subjected to frequency-phase conversion to be converted 

into a phase signal by an APF (14), the phase signal 
being applied to a phase-comparator (4⊘) in which the 

phase signal and a color signal from a path (39) are 
compared with each other. An output of the phase-comparator 

(4⊘) is applied to an LPF (42), and an output 
of the LPF (42) becomes a voltage signal having a level 

according to a phase difference of the both signals. Two 
voltage signals having different levels are alternately 

outputted at every 2H in a SECAM system, while only one 
voltage signal is outputted in other television systems. 

A rectangular-wave signal is produced from the voltage 
signal by a sampling/holding circuit (46), the 

rectangular-wave signal being phase-compared with a 
rectangular-wave signal delayed by 1H through a 1H delay 

circuit (48) in a phase-comparator (5⊘). On the basis of 
a signal according to phase-comparison, and it is 

possible to determine a television system of the SECAM 
system or a PAL system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television
receiver and a television signal determination circuit.
More specifically, the present invention relates to a
television signal determination circuit which is provided
in a television receiver or a television signal
recording/reproducing apparatus capable of selectively
receiving color television signals of different color
television system such as SECAM system, PAL system, NTSC
system and etc., and determines the color television
system.One example of such a kind of prior art is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Laying-Open Gazette No. 57-2⊘7494 laid
open on December 2⊘, 1982. In the prior art, a voltage
signal according to a sub-carrier frequency is obtained
by passing an input color signal through a bandpass
filter which may be a ceramic filter having a high
quality factor (Q), and the voltage signal is applied to
a resonance amplifier having a tuned point at a frequency 
of a half of a horizontal frequency (fH). If an output
of the resonance amplifier is a sine-wave, it is possible
to determine that a color television signal is of the
SECAM system wherein the sub-carrier frequency is changed
at every two horizontal lines (2H).In this prior art, it is necessary to use the
ceramic filter and the resonance amplifier of fH/2, and
therefore, there was a problem that it is difficult to
incorporate such a television signal determination
circuit into an integrated circuit.JP-A-58 133 092 discloses a circuit to discriminate signals
of PAL and SECAM television systems connecting a filter
circuit to a video amplifier with a terminal to which a
burst signal is inputted, and the output side is connected
to buffer amplifiers. A sampling/holding circuit having a
burst gate terminal is connected to the output side of one
buffer amplifier, and a rectifying circuit, a comparator
circuit and a grounded capacitor are connected to the
output side of the sampling/holding circuit. However, it is
not known from this prior art device to integrate a delay
circuit for delaying a phase of the held signal.JP-A-02 288 489 discribes a PAL/SECAM signal determination
circuit detecting the level of a burst signal of a colour
signal from a frequency conversion circuit and calculating
a difference to an output of a level detection circuit
before horizontal synchronization and comparing the
difference with a reference level. However, the document
does not disclose the advantagous combination of a the
delay circuit with a sampling/holding circuit. Therefore, a principal object of the present
inven
