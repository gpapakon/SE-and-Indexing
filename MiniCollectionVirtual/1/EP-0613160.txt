<ABSTRACT>
The described switch comprises a casing (3) housing 
fixed contacts (5, 6) and a movable contact element (8) 

to be operated through at least one control pushbutton 
(9) projecting externally of a front side (10) of the 

casing (3) for breaking and restoring an electric 
continuity between the fixed contacts (5, 6). Sealingly 

engaged on said front side (10) is a closure wall (13) 
exhibiting one or more guide collars (14) over each of 

which the respective control pushbutton (9) is slidably 
and sealingly fitted. Coaxially engaged with each 

control pushbutton (9) is one transmission rod (15) 
operatively connecting the pushbutton with the movable 

contact element (8) for controlling the displacement 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an electric switch including
a protection device
against water splashes
according to the preamble of claim 1
(US-A-2040919).In the embodiment described the inventive solution is
adopted on a switch of the type to be used mainly on
household electrical appliances. It is however
understood that the innovatory concepts proposed in the
present invention can be also adopted in switches
intended for uses other than the above one.It is known that electric switches and similar switching
members of the above type essentially comprise an
insulating casing housing at least one pair of fixed
contacts each terminating at a respective pole of an
electric circuit to which the switch is connected.
Housed in the casing is at least one movable contact
element that, through a control pushbutton manually
operable from the outside, can be moved for selectively
opening and closing the electric connection between said
fixed contacts.The foregoing being stated, it is noted that said 
switches are often associated with apparatus that may
accidentally operate or are conceived for use in the
presence of water or in highly damp environments, as
well as in the presence of other external agents
particularly damaging for the correct operation of the
switch.It is apparent that in the absence of appropriate
expedients or protection devices, this situation
involves many problems in terms of correct operation and
safety.In fact, if even a small amount of water should enter
the casing, making the contacts wet, inevitably electric
discharges and/or shortcircuits would occur which not
only can damage the electric circuit to which the switch
is connected but also involve high risks for the safety
of the appliance's user.In order to obviate the above drawbacks, in case of
switches destined to appliances intended for use in the
presence of liquids or in very damp environments, it has
been hitherto provided that sealing means be associated
with said switches, which means generally consists of a
flexible covering element disposed such as to close the
front side of the casing from which the control
pushbutton projects.In greater detail, this flexibile covering element
mainly made in silicone or other appropriate material,
has a perimetric sealing edge engaged on said front side
by an appropriate fastening frame so as to fully
insulate the casing and, as a result, all components
housed therein, from the surrounding atmosphere.However this solution is particularly heavy from an
economic point of view above all in

<CLAIMS>
An electric switch including
a protection device against water splashes,

each switch comprising:

a casing (3) made of electrically insulating material
and housing fixed contacts (5, 6) and at least one

movable contact element (8) selectively movable between
an opening condition and a closure condition, in order

to respectively break and restore an electric continuity
between the fixed contacts (5, 6);
at least one control pushbutton (9) projecting
externally of a front side (10) of the casing (3) and

manually operable for controlling the displacement of
the movable contact element (8) between the closure and

opening conditions;
sealing means acting on the front side (10) of the
casing (3) for preventing external agents from

penetrating into the casing,
said sealing means comprising:
a closure wall sealingly associated with the front
side of the casing;
at least one guide collar (14) projecting externally
of the closure wall (13);
at least one transmission rod (15) slidably passing
through the guide collar (14) for connecting the control

pushbutton (9) to the movable contact element (8), said
control pushbutton (9) having a bottom wall (16) engaged

to one end of the transmission rod (15) and a perimetric
wall (17) which is sealingly fitted around the guide

collar (14),
characterized int that

said casing (3) in engagement with a shaped opening
(22a) defined in a support wall (22), has a perimetric

projection (3b) engaged in a perimetric recess (23)
defined around said shaped opening (22a), at least one

annular sealing element (24) being interposed between
the perimetric projection (3b) and a locating housing

(23a) formed in the perimetric recess (23) so that
liquids cannot penetrate into the switch through the

shaped opening (22a).
A switch according to claim 1, characterized in that
close to the closure wall (13), said sealing means

defines a labyrinth path for preventing liquid from
penetrating into the casing (3).
A switch according to claim 1, characterized in that
it further comprises at least one seal (18) operatively 

engaged between the perimetric wall (17) of the control
pushbutton (9) and said collar (14).
A switch according to claim 1, characterized in that
it comprises two control pushbuttons (9) each engaged on

a corresponding guide collar (14) and carrying
respective transmission rods (15) that are in

engagement, on mutually opposite sides, with a rocking
element (19) operatively connected to the movable

contact element (8) for controlling the displacement of
said movable contact element between the closure and

opening positions.
