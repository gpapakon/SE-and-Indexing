<DESCRIPTION>
 WHEELED CHASSIS AND STEERING DEVICE FOR STEERING IT.The present invention relates to a wheeled chassis including a drive device for driving the wheels, and which wheeled chassis may serve as chassis for a wheelchair or as a wheeled chassis for the transporting of some other object, the wheeled chassis having at least one of the wheels driven by the drive device through an intermediary drive transmission, and whereby at least one of the wheels for the steering of the driving course of the chassis is mounted to the chassis through a steerable support being steerable by means of at least one, to the steerable support connected, steering motor which steering motor receives steering signals from a steering panel with steering control devices, and whereby the wheeled chassis further comprises support means adapted to support a chair or other holding means adapted for the fixation and holding of the said objects to be transported.Generally, most wheelchairs of prior art technique, which are employed for transporting of invalid persons or of weaker or ill persons being unable to walk themselves, are made in conformity with the above described technique of prior art, i.e. they comprise a chassis, generally a frame shaped chassis, which through suitably suspended wheels, the suspension means thereby comprising suitable spring means and being of per se known kind, carries four ground-engaging wheels of suitable sizes, of which wheels two may be fitted to the chassis with one on each of two opposite sides of the chassis the wheels being carried through a common in cross direction arranged wheel axle or through two separate wheel axles, which are arranged sharing a common geometric axis, and whereby the further two of the ground-engaging wheels are steerably suspended in that their steering axes are vertically oriented, and in that in general two of these ground-engaging wheels are 

connected to a wheel drive means and being made steerable as described above as from a steering control panel situated as suitable within easy reach of the person being transported by the wheel chair. At such an arrangement of the ground-engaging wheels they in general are arranged as in case of a common rear- wheel-driven automobile, though the suspension structures for the wheels do have a more simple structural shape, because they only are going to be operated at fairly low drive speeds. On the other hand, the steering wheels are suspended in such a manner so that geometrically the vertical steering axis is located in front of the
