<ABSTRACT>
"A modular theft-protected display case for rings", permitting 
handling and trying-on of the ring which is secured by a strong 

metallic cord, riveted at the ends which are placed in the axial 
perforation in a counterweight placed in coinciding grooves which 

make it impossible to remove it from the display case.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a "modular theft-protected 
display case for rings" which is made of hard plastics or 
the like and which can be adapted to the market requirements 
of each case with the use of different modules in the 
dimensions required, and which has a simple theft-protection 
device of proven efficacy. Until now, the sale of rings has involved serious 
difficulties because of the ease with which they can be 
removed, particularly in department stores, since such sales 
are public and the potential buyer must have access in order 
to the try a ring on, all of which makes it possible to 
remove them. In an attempt to counteract this danger, staff 
must employ very direct surveillance, thereby raising the 
cost of sales personnel without offering a high percentage 
of security against possible theft. There are at present display cases with security 
devices which do not allow the public access to try a ring, 
so that one sales employee must at all times be dedicated to 
each customer. In order to improve this situation, the present 
invention has been created to permit easy public access to 
the ring, in order to try a variety of sizes on, thereby 
enhancing sales while at the same time providing each ring 
with an effective theft-protection device. The benefits of this invention are revealed by the 
enclosed specifications, although some are hereby referred 
to, by way of illustration and without limitation, as 
follows:  1) A variety of modules can be adapted to the size 
requirements of the market in each particular case. 2) Free public access to the ring, in order to try 
different sizes. 3) An effective theft-protection device which, as 
pointed out, enables a potential buyer to handle the ring. For a better understanding of these specifications, 
the attached drawings are included to show a possible 
design, without limitation, of the subject of this 
invention, and in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a module of the 
display case. Figure 2 is a frontal view of a transparent strip 
which partially covers the opening for handling the ring-holder 
bands. Figure 3 is a top side view of the display case cover. Figure 4 shows the spring securing the ring strip. Figure 5 is a view of the ring with its safety device. Figure 6 is a frontal view of the inside of the 
display case cover with the ring-holder strips and their 
safety device. Figure 7 is a cross-section of the guides on which the 
ring-holder strips slide. Figure 8 is a frontal and side view of the ring-holder 
strip.

"A modular theft-protected display case for 
rings", wherein there is a hollow case (1) of rectangular 

base, with a peripheral strengthener (2), the longer sides 
of which are trapezoid-shaped (3), with the edges internally 

strengthened by posts (4) and whose rear vertical face has 
three horizontal sections, the lowest of which is fixed (5), 

the middle one of which (6) slides and the top one of which 
is hollow. 

   The cover (7) has a series of vertical lines of 
openings (8) whose external perimeter is a shortened-cone 

shape and at the bottom of which there is a slit. 
   Secured to the inside of the cover, a set of 

rectangular strips (12) slides with round vertical holes 
(13) aligned with the concave openings in the cover and 

which, at the bottom, have slits (14) connecting with said 
holes. Said strips have semi-circular heads at right angles 

to the strip, ending at the side opposite to the head in a 
small central groove (15). 

   Said strips slide in two-sided vertical guides (16) 
which widen (17) in the zone opposite the head which is 

crossed horizontally by a shaft (18) also introduced into 
the upper rings of a spring (19), terminating at the 

opposite end in a "U" shape (20) fixed in to the end grooves 
(15) of the ring-holder strips. 

   Alongside said strips, on the inside of the cover, 
there are two fixed rectangular bands (21), each with 

symmetrical U-shaped openings. 
"A modular theft-protected display case for 
rings" as set forth in claim 1, wherein the rectangular 

bands inside the cover slide on a guide. 
"A modular theft-protected display case for 
rings" as set forth in the above claims, wherein the top 

rear space in the display case can be partly covered by a 
strip (fig. 2) in the form of a right angle, the short side 

of which is inserted in a U-shaped opening between the 
outside surface of the cover (7) and a band (9) placed on 

it, and supported on it only at the ends. 
"A modular theft-protected display case for 
rings" as set forth in the above claims, wherein the ring 

(22) is placed on a metal cord (23), the ends of which are 
riveted together and placed in the axial vertical opening 

of a counterweight (24).
