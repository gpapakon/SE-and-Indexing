<ABSTRACT>
A top loading laundry washing machine is described, comprising a door (2) being 
movable between a substantially vertical position, for loading the machine (figs 1 and 

3), and a substantially horizontal position, for operation (figs 2 and 4), the lower part 
of the door (2) being provided with a washing agents dispensing device. Said 

dispensing device (12) comprises a compartment (13) for receiving a washing agent 
(detergent or additive) in powder and/or liquid form, that has an opening for the 

loading of said washing agent and at least one opening for the automatically 
commanded discharge of said washing agent, said loading aperture and said 

discharge aperture in particular coinciding, and occlusion means of said discharge 
aperture, in particular a mobile flap (14), the opening of which, by way of an 

appropriate actuating organ, is commanded by the programming device (5) of the 
machine, at an appropriate moment of the operation cycle of the latter, so as to 

cause the delivery of a determined dose of said washing agent; in following the 
opening of said occlusion means (14), said washing agent contained in said 

compartment (13) can fall or flow due to gravity within the washing chamber (6) of 
the machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a top loading laundry washing machine comprising a
door being movable between a substantially vertical position for loading, and a
substantially horizontal position, for operation, the lower part of the door being
provided with a washing agents dispensing device.As is known, in the washing machines of the cited type the loading and unloading of
laundry to be washed is realized through an aperture obtained in the superior wall of
the cabinet of the machine, which faces a corresponding aperture present in the
superior part of the washing chamber; the basket of the machine, assembled so as
to revolve within the chamber, also presents an opening, that can be closed with
appropriate means; said opening in the loading/unloading phases of the laundry is
made to be found at the top position, by way of known means.The abovementioned aperture obtained in the superior wall of the cabinet of the
machine is apt at being closed by a door, generally hinged along the rear side of the
latter, and being movable between a substantially vertical position for loading, and a
substantially horizontal position, of operation and closure.In the described type of machine it is known to provide on the lower part of the door
a dispensing device, able to provide different kinds of washing agents, such as
detergents and additives in powder and/or liquid form; such known devices are
provided for carrying out the delivery of detergents, generally in powder, and/or of
additives, generally liquid softeners, in different established times, under the control 
of the programmer, or timer, of the laundry washing machine.The realisation of such top loading washing machines, and the realisation of
dispensers used within the same, is generally shown to be complicated, expensive,
and at times unreliable.For example, from the document EP-A-83.532 a dispenser of the type described is
known, comprising two distinct containers for the washing agents, obtained on the
lower surface of the door. Such containers, of a cylindrical form, provide loading
thresholds which define the maximum dose of the agents that can be contained
within. The machine further comprises two nozzles apt at creating, with water coming
from the water mains, tangential jets respect the cylindrical wall of the two
containers, so as to generate a circular movement of water within the containers
themselves and to create as a consequence a vortex that lifts and moves the
washing agent over the said threshold level, thus causing it to fall in the

<CLAIMS>
Top loading laundry washing machine, comprising a door (2) in the lower
part of which a washing agents dispenser (12) is provided, comprising at least one

compartment (13) for receiving a washing agent, said compartment (13) having an
aperture for the loading of said washing agent and its subsequent discharge in a

washing chamber (6), occlusion means (14) being provided for said aperture, which
are made to open by way of an appropriate actuating organ controlled by the

programming device (5) of the machine, wherein following the opening of said
occlusion means (14), said washing agent can fall due to gravity within said washing

chamber (6), characterised in that:

said door (2) is movable between a substantially vertical position and a
substantially horizontal position and has on its underside a box-like portion (11),

being of a plastic material and defining a recess within which the body of said
dispenser (12) is at least partly housed, the aperture of said compartment (13)

facing upwards when the door (2) is in its substantially vertical position;
said occlusion means comprise a flap (14) being hinged to the body of said
dispenser (13), a elastic means interacting between the body of the dispenser

(12) and said flap (14) for bringing said flap (14) to an open position when the
latter is released by said actuating organ, said flap (14) being apt at retaining

within said compartment (13) detergent either in the powder or the liquid form;
either the body of the dispenser (12) is fixed within said recess in an inclined
position or said compartment (13) has a wall of an inclined profile, for favouring

the delivery due to gravity of the washing agent within said washing chamber (6).
Top loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 1, characterised
in that means are provided for allowing the removal of at least a part of said

dispenser (12), for cleaning purposes.
Top loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 1, characterised
in that means (18-19;20) are provided for directing substantially in correspondence

of said compartment (13) jets or splashes of liquid (E;21).
Top loading laundry washing machine, according to claim 3, characterised
