<CLAIMS>
Use of polymers I which are composed of, in 
polymerized form,
 
from 15 to 80% by weight of at least one monomer of the 

formula I and/or the salts thereof (monomers a) 

 
where R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 independently of one another are each 
H or C
1
-C
3
-alkyl, R
4
 is C
1
-C
5
-alkylene and X is O or NH, 
and
 
from 20 to 85% by weight of at least one monomer capable 

of undergoing free radical copolymerization (monomers b), 
with the proviso that the average molar solubility of the 

components of the mixture of all the monomers b polymerized 
at 25°C in water is lower than the correspondingly 

defined average molar solubility of the components of the 
mixture of all the monomers a polymerized, as assistants 

in the spray drying of aqueous dispersions of polymers II 
which differ from the polymers I. 
Use of polymers I as claimed in claim 1, which 
contain, as at least one monomer a, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic 

acid and/or the salts thereof as 
polymerized units. 
Use of polymers I as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
whose monomers b contained as polymerized units are 

selected so that the glass transition temperature T
g
b
 of 
a polymer composed only of the monomers b would be ≥ 60°C 

according to Fox.  
 
A process for spray drying aqueous dispersions of 
at least one polymer II, wherein at least one polymer I 

is added as an assistant. 
A polymer powder obtainable by a process as 
claimed in claim 4. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
inlet temperature of the drying air is from 100 to 200°C 

and the outlet temperature of the drying air is from 30 
to 90°C. 
A synthetic resin render containing at least one 
polymer powder as claimed in claim 5. 
A mineral binder containing at least one polymer 
powder as claimed in claim 5. 
A dry synthetic resin render composition containing 
at least one polymer powder as claimed in claim 5. 
Use of polymer powders as claimed in claim 5 in 
compositions for coating or adhesion.
