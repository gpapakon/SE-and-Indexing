<ABSTRACT>
A partition for forming fencing, or cages for 
warehouses, repair shops and the like, typically 

comprises a plurality of spaced, vertical posts (12,14,16,17) and at 
least one mesh wall (18,20) vertically positioned between the 

spaced, vertical posts and attached to them. The mesh 
wall defines a horizontally extending portion (30,32) extending 

substantially the length of the mesh wall, with the 
horizontally extending portion being integral with the 

mesh wall but bent into transverse relation with the 
remainder of the vertically positioned mesh wall. The 

horizontally extending portion stiffens the mesh wall. 
Preferably the mesh wall defines a pair of such 

horizontally extending portions, one at the top (30) and one 
at the bottom (32) of the mesh wall. Also, by this invention 

a pair of mesh walls may be attached to the vertical 
posts in vertical relation to each other, being attached 

to each other by connector means (36,38,40) through the horizontally 
extending portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Mesh partitions are commonly used for the 
construction of security cages in factories, garages and 
elsewhere, where tools and parts may be inexpensively 
secured under lock and key. Such mesh partitions may be 
assembled into cages of desired size, with such products 
being sold, for example, by the Folding Guard Company of 
Chicago, Illinois, and numerous other companies. To assemble such a cage from mesh walls, the 
individual mesh walls are assembled together, typically 
with horizontal and vertical metal peripheral 
reinforcements, so that the mesh walls are basically 
framed on all sides with a rigid, metal reinforcement. 
Then, the framed mesh walls are attached through the 
vertical reinforcements to vertical posts which may be 
typically either attached to the floor or to the wall of 
a building. In accordance with this invention, sturdy, 
reliable enclosures may be made from partitions which 
comprise one or more mesh walls and which may be  
 
generally free of horizontal reinforcing members, which 
in the prior art are used to provide stiffening to the 
mesh wall. The mesh wall may also be directly attached 
to vertical posts without the need of vertical peripheral 
reinforcements, with the posts being attached to 
typically the floor, or to a wall if desired. By this invention, a reliable, sturdy, stiff 
partition may be provided at a substantial reduction in 
cost, since the horizontal metal reinforcements are no 
longer needed to provide the desired stiffening of the 
mesh wall or walls of this invention. Frequently, the 
cost of an installed enclosure making use of the 
partition of this invention can be about half those of 
the prior art without any significant loss in strength. By this invention, a partition is provided 
which can be used to make enclosures, fences or other 
barriers and walls. The enclosure comprises a plurality 
of spaced, vertical posts and at least one mesh wall 
which is vertically positioned between the spaced 
vertical posts, and attached to the posts. The mesh wall 
defines a horizontally extending portion which extends 
substantially the length of the mesh wall and is integral 
with the mesh wall, but is bent into transverse relation  
 
with the remainder of the vertically positioned mesh 
wall. The horizontally extending portion stiffens the 
mesh wall to reduce or eliminate the need for other 
horizontal reinforcing members such as metal track 
members and the like. The term "mesh wall" is intended to include 
wire mesh sheets which comprise crossing wires

<CLAIMS>
A partition which comprises: 
   a plurality of spaced, vertical posts; at least 

one mesh wall vertically positioned between said spaced, 
vertical posts and attached thereto, said mesh wall 

defining a horizontally extending portion extending 
substantially the length of said mesh wall, said 

horizontally extending portion being integral with said 
mesh wall but bent into transverse relation with the 

remainder of said vertically positioned mesh wall, 
whereby said horizontally extending portion stiffens said 

mesh wall. 
The partition of Claim 1 in which the width 

of the horizontally extending portion is less than half 
the vertical height of said mesh wall. 
The partition of Claim 1 in which a pair 
of said mesh walls is attached to said vertical posts in 

vertical relation to each other, and attached to each 
other by connector means through said horizontally 

extending portions defined by each mesh wall, each said 
horizontally extending portion of each mesh wall being 

located at a horizontal edge of said mesh wall. 
A partition which comprises: 
   a plurality of spaced, vertical posts; at least 

one mesh wall vertically positioned between said spaced, 
vertical posts and attached thereto, said mesh wall 

defining a horizontally extending portion extending 
substantially the length of said mesh wall, said 

horizontally extending portion being integral with said 
mesh wall but bent into transverse relation with the 

remainder of said vertically positioned mesh wall, 
whereby said horizontally extending portion stiffens said 

mesh wall, said mesh wall defining a pair of said 
 

horizontally extending portions, one at the top and one 
at the bottom of said mesh wall, said mesh wall being 

substantially free of added, horizontal reinforcing 
members. 
The partition of Claim 4 in which said mesh 
wall has a vertical cross-section of a flattened U-shape. 
The partition of Claim 5 in which the 
width of the horizontally extending portion is less than 

half the vertical height of said mesh wall. 
The partition of Claim 6 in which a pair 
of said mesh walls are attached to said vertical posts 

in vertical relation to each other, and attached to each 
other through said horizontally extending portions 

defined by each mesh wall, each said horizontally 
extending portion of each mesh wall being located at a 

horizontal edge of said mesh wall, a horizontally 
extending portion of each mesh wall being attached to a 

horizontally extending portion of the other mesh wall by 
connector means. 
The partition of Claim 1 or 7 in which said 
mesh wall comprises crossing wires. 
A partition which comprises a vertically 
positioned mesh wall, said mesh wall defining a 

horizontally extending portion extending substantially 
the length of said mesh wall, said horizontally extending 

portion being integral with said mesh wall but bent into 
transverse relation with the remainder of said vertically 

positioned mesh wall, whereby said horizontally extending 
portion stiffens said mesh wall. 
The partition of Claim 1 or 9 in which said 
mesh wall defines a pair of said horizontally extending 

portions, one at the top and one at the bottom of said 
mesh wall. 
The partition of Claim 10 in which said 
mesh wall has a vertical cross section of a flattened U-shape. 
The partition of Claim 9 in which a pair 
of said mesh walls are positioned in vertical relation 

to each other, and attached to each other by connector 
means through said horizontally extending portions 

defined by each mesh wall. 
The partition of Claim 1 or 9 in which said 
mesh wall is substantially free of added, horizontal 

reinforcing members.
