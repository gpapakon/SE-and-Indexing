<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
control device according to the preamble of claim 1.Recently, speech detection devices for detecting the
presence/absence of speech have been widely used for
applications such as speech recognition, speaker recognition,
equipment operation by speech, and input to computer by speech.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a prior art speech
detection device, whose configuration and operation will be
explained hereinafter. A power detection section 19 detects
a power value in an input signal to render the value to be
compared by a comparator 21, and then the comparator 21
compares the value with a predetermined set value of a
threshold setting section 20 to output a speech-detected
signal when the value is larger than the predetermined set
value.According to the prior art speech detection device as
described above, however, even if a speech input is small ,
when the input signal contains a noise other than the speech, 
a power detected by the power detection section 19 larger
than the set value of the threshold setting section 20,
causes the voice-detected signal to be outputted, thereby
developing an inconvenience of frequent erroneous detections.The article "Auswertung von Echtzeit-Cepstra zur
schnellen Detektion stimmhafter Laute" of M. Timme, H. Idler
und T. Lay, Nachrichtentechnische Zeitschrift, 1973,
Vol. 7, pp. 112 and following teaches to use a cepstrum of
a speech signal for speech recognition.The paper "A speech-to-noise ratio measurement algorithm"
by J.T. Sims discloses an algorithm to measure
speech-to-noise ratios. It attributes the energy within
each consecutive 20 ms frame of a speech plus noise waveform
to either a speech or noise source. This discrimination
process is based upon the known characteristics of frame
energy histograms of such waveforms.It is the object of the present invention to provide
an improved method of recognizing speech signals.This object is solved in accordance with the features
of the independent claims, dependent claims are directed on
preferred embodiments of the invention. With a configuration according as claimed,
a power calculation section calculates a power of 
a signal input, and a cepstrum calculation section through a
peak detection section detects a peak of the calculated
cepstrum. A signal detection section detects the presence/absence
of a signal from the peak of the cepstrum, and when
the signal is present, supplies the signal-detected signal
to an AND section. Also, an S/N calculation section
calculates an S/N
