<ABSTRACT>
A diphenylamine with both the phenyl groups being 
substituted is prepared by reacting a phenol with ammonia 

in the presence of a hydrogen transfer catalyst 
and a cyclohexanone; or by converting a portion of the 

phenol to the cyclohexanone in the presence of a 
hydrogen transfer catalyst and under hydrogen pressure 

and then reacting the remaining portion of the phenol 
with ammonia in the presence of the cyclohexanone so 

converted and the hydrogen transfer catalyst. The 
diphenylamine can be obtained very efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of a novel diphenylamine in which each phenyl 
group is substituted. Diphenylamines available according 
to the present invention are useful as antioxidants 
for mineral oils, synthetic oils and the like and also 
as resin additives. As a process for the preparation of a diphenylamine 
containing one or more substituents on each 
phenyl group, it has already been known to prepare 
dinonyldiphenylamine by subjecting nonene and 
diphenylamine to the Friedel-Crafts alkylation in the 
presence of a metal halide such as aluminum chloride or 
zinc chloride or an acid catalyst such as sulfuric 
acid, phosphoric acid or acid clay (Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 188555/1990). This process, however, is accompanied with the 
drawback that it is difficult to add a sufficient 
amount of nonene to diphenylamine. Thus, the resultant 
dinonyldiphenylamine contains the mono-substituted 
derivative and is low in purity.  The present inventors have conducted extensive 
research with a view toward overcoming the above drawback 
and developing an industrially more advantageous 
process. As a result, it has been found that a 
diphenylamine with both the phenyl groups being substituted 
can be obtained with high selectivity by 
reacting a phenol with ammonia in the presence of a 
cyclohexanone, leading to the completion of the present 
invention. The present invention therefore provides a process 
for the preparation of a diphenylamine represented 
by the following formula (3): 
wherein R represents a C₈₋₁₄ alkyl, C₅₋₈ cycloalkyl, 
C₈₋₁₄ alkoxyl, aryl or aryloxyl group and n stands for 
an integer of 1-5, which comprises reacting, in the 
presence of a hydrogen transfer catalyst and a 
cyclohexanone represented by the following formula (1):  wherein R and n have the same meanings as defined 
above, ammonia with a phenol represented by the following 
formula (2): 
wherein R and n have the same meanings as defined 
above; and also a process for the preparation of a 
diphenylamine represented by the formula (3) which comprises 
converting, in the presence of a hydrogen transfer 
catalyst under hydrogen pressure, a portion of a 
phenol represented by the formula (2) to a 
cyclohexanone represented by the formula (1) and, while 
using the remaining portion of the phenol (2) as a 
hydrogen acceptor, thereby forming the cyclohexanone 
represented by the formula (1) in a reaction system 
successively, conducting reaction with ammonia. Examples of R in the formulas (1), (2) and
