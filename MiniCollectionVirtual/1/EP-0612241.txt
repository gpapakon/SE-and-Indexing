<ABSTRACT>
Ionic compositions comprise an active ingredient absorbed within a network of internal pores defined by a plurality of polymeric particles. The particles are preferably crosslinked polymeric beads having a diameter in the range from about 5 to 100 microns and a surface charge density from about 0.1 to 10 meq/qm hydrogen ion capacity. The active ingredients are released from the ionic polymer beads over time when orally administered, applied to a keratinic material, typically human skin or hair or otherwise delivered to a target environment. The use of a cationic charge promotes adhesion of the beads to the keratinic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IONIC BEADS USEFUL FOR CONTROLLED RELEASE AND ADSORPTIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the preparation of topical and oral compositions. More particularly, it relates to the preparation of ionic polymer delivery systems which prolong the activity of various topically active ingredients by increasing the substantivity on keratinic materials, such as hair and skin, and to orally delivered polymers which release active substances via ion-exchange.The adherent properties of topically-applied substances on hair and skin affects both initial adsorption and retention, particularly on subsequent exposure to water. The combined characteristics of adsorption and retention constitute the property referred to as "substantivity," which can be defined as the ability of a substance to be adsorbed onto keratin and to resist removal by water rinse-off. An ideal topical substance would have adsorptive affinity for keratinic materials, retain activity for long periods of time, resist being washed away by perspiration and other contact with water, and be free of adverse interactions with other ingredients of which incorporation is desirous. No topical substance has yet been discovered which adequately satisfies all of these objectives.Some of the most popular topically active preparations available in the market today include, for example, fragrance substances; cosmetic substances, such as lipsticks, make-up and foundation powders; insect repellents; anti-bacterials; acne treatment formulations; 

 hair treatment formulations, such as conditioners and hair growth promoting agents; and skin protection formulations, such as age-prevention agents; and ultraviolet absorbing substances (sunscreens) . These ingredients, substances, or formulations may be used alone, or in combination with each other, and may be applied in pure form or diluted in a suitable solvent or carrier.A frequently observed problem with such topically active substances is the rapid loss of activity after application to the skin. Under usual conditions of heavy perspiration and/or contact with water, concentration of the above substances in their respective topical compositions is either diluted, thereby reducing effectiveness, or washed away, thereby losing all effectiveness. One way to extend activity is by increasing the concentrations of the active ingredient in their respective formulations. However, as concentrations are increased, so too are the risks of toxic and allergic reactions to
