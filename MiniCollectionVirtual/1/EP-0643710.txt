Such optically active, intermediate lactones are prepared from L-aspartic acid, and can be readily converted to (+)-pilocarpine and its analogues by hydrolysis, reduction, and hydrogenation, such as to an optically active lactone having formula (VIII) which is (+)-pilocarpine when R is ethyl, R

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHESIS OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE LACTONES FROM L-ASPARTIC ACID AND INTERMEDIATES THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to the synthesis of optically active lactones, and more particularly relates to the synthesis of compounds that are analogues of (+)-pilocarpine from L-aspartic acid through certain key intermediates. Thus, these intermediate compounds are important for the manufacture of therapeutically useful compounds.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (+)-Pilocarpine, the most important imidazole alkaloid, has been for many years the focus of much attention because of its extensive pharmapological properties. These include diaphoretic effects, stimulation of the parasympathetic system, miotic action, and particularly applications in ophthalmology. Pilocarpine is currently the drug of choice for treatment of narrow and wide angle glaucoma because it decreases the intraocular pressure and can be administered for long periods without side effects. Pilocarpine along with its epimer isopilocarpine was first isolated in 1875 from various species of Pilocarpus plants belonging to the Rutaceae family. The structure and stereochemistry of this alkaloid, proposed in 1900, was later confirmed in degradation studies, X- ray analysis, and several syntheses. 

 Earlier syntheses of (+)-pilocarpine were based on the formation of the lactone ring at an early stage followed by various group transformation and construction of the imidazole ring in the final stages. These syntheses suffered from the burden of many steps, low yields, lack of stereoselectivity, and mixtures of N-methylimidazole regiosiomers. A later approach to (+)-pilocarpine was based on using a preformed imidazole nucleus and building the lactone at a subsequent stage. However, the reported yield was less than 1%. Link, Helv. Chim. Acta 55, 1053 (1972) . More recently a synthesis of (+)-pilocarpine starting with L-histidine was reported. Noordam, Rec. J.R. Neth. Chem. Soc. , 100 , 441 (1981) . This synthesis is based on regioselective methylation of L-histidine, alkylation of the a-carbon with an ethyl malonate, and decarboxylation and formation of the lactone. In this last route the alkylation and decarboxylation steps occurred with limited stereochemical control, resulting in a mixture of diastereoisomeric products.A chirospecific synthesis of (+)-pilocarpine using D-methionine or D-2-aminobutanol as chiral educt has been reported. Compagnone and Rapoport, J. Org. Chem. , 51 : 10, 1713 (1986). However, the yield is reduced
