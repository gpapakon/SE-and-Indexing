<ABSTRACT>
Fluoronitrobenzenes are prepared advantageously by a chlorine/fluorine exchange reaction in which a chlorine atom and a fluorine atom from the corresponding chloronitrobenzenes and an alkali metal fluoride are exchanged, the process being carried out by catalysing the reaction with a quaternary ammonium compound containing at least one alkoxypolyoxyalkyl radical.
