<ABSTRACT>
Superabsorbent acrylic polymers for water and aqueous fluids, with improved physical properties, especially a short gelling time, a high gel strength and high capillary suction under pressure. These products are obtained by virtue of a process for double polymerisation in aqueous suspension involving a surfactant with high hydrolipophilic balance in the course of the first polymerisation and a surfactant with low hydrolipophilic balance in the course of the second polymerisation.

<CLAIMS>
In a process for obtaining a polyacrylic acid 
polymer in superabsorbent powder form for aqueous fluids, 

according to a process comprising a first step of 
polymerization of a first acrylic acid monomer charge in 

aqueous phase in inverse suspension in an organic solvent 
in the presence of an emulsifier having an HLB of between 

8 and 12, then a second step of polymerization of a 
second charge, absorbed beforehand within the polymer gel 

obtained in the first step, an improvement which consists: 

in introducing a crosslinking agent into the first 
aqueous phase of acrylic acid, 
in using a second acrylic acid charge in a ratio by 
weight of 1 to 1.2 to the first acrylic acid charge, and 
in adding to the reaction medium, after absorption of 
the second monomer charge and before initiating the 

polymerization thereof, a surfactant having an HLB of 
between 2 and 5. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the emulsifier having an HLB of between 2 and 5 is 

sucrose di/tristearate. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the crosslinking agent is a bisacrylic derivative or 

a diglycidyl ether. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the crosslinking agent is 

N,N-methylenebisacrylamide. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the crosslinking agent is ethylene glycol diglycidyl 

ether.  
 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that, in the first step, during which a 

first acrylic acid monomer charge in aqueous phase is 
placed in inverse suspension in an organic solvent, the 

ratio by weight of the aqueous phase to the organic phase 
ranges from 0.7 to 1.1. 
Superabsorbent powder obtainable by a process 
according to any of the preceding claims and exhibiting 

the following characteristics: 

a gelling time of between 15 and 40 seconds, 
a gel strength of more than 2,800 pascals, 
capillary suction under 2 kPa of more than 30 ml/g, 
capillary suction under 5 kPa of more than 20 ml/g, 
an absorption capacity of more than 50 g/g, 
a proportion of extractibles of less than 10 %, 
a fines content of less than 10 % and 
retention of more than 28 g/g.
