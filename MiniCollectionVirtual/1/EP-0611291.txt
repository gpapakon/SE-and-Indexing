<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for imaging a cross section of a
small cavity such as a coronary vessel.More in particular the invention relates to an apparatus for removing
artifacts from a generated image. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(PTCA) provides an alternative to coronary artery
bypass graphs or open-heart surgery as means for
treating atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a
particular type of heart disease wherein the
deposition of fatty material on the inside of vessel
walls throughout the body causes the artery to narrow
and restrict the flow of blood. If the artery becomes
too narrow, the heart muscle that is nourished by the
artery receives insufficient oxygen and a myocardial
infarction or heart attack can occur. Atherosclerosis
can occur throughout the human body, however, it is
most life threatening within the coronary vasculature.Transluminal angioplasty surgery utilizes an
elongated, flexible catheter having an inflatable 
balloon at its distal end that is inserted at an
appropriate position into the vascular system of a
patient. After the catheter is inserted into the
vascular system, its balloon is routed to a stenosis.
Once the balloon is properly positioned relative to
the stenotic lesion, it is inflated with fluid under
relatively high pressure. As the balloon expands, it
dilates the stenosis, thus allowing blood to flow more
freely.Ultrasonic imaging devices have been developed
for imaging inner walls or inner peripheral features
of a blood vessel so as to determine the location of a
stenotic lesion or stenosis and to obtain a visual
image of the stenosis for diagnosis purposes. An
example of such an ultrasonic imaging device is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,917,097.Ultrasonic imaging devices such as the one
illustrated in the '097 patent
include piezoelectric elements or transducers for
generating ultrasonic waves and detecting echoes or
reflections off the inner wall of the stenotic lesion.
The piezoelectric elements flex in response to a
received electric pulse and generate an ultrasonic
wave in response to the electrically-induced flexing. 
Mechanical relaxation of a piezoelectric element after
it has been electrically excited results in a damped
oscillation of the transducer element, which causes
the element to generate an electrical signal typically
referred to as a "ringdown" signal.Initially, the ringdown signal generated by the
piezoelectric element is generally a much stronger
signal than the signal typically generated by an echo
of the ultrasonic
