<ABSTRACT>
To manufacture airbags consisting of a contact fabric and/or a filter fabric it is proposed to use hollow fibre synthetic filament yarns having a hollow area fraction of 10-40%, based on the total cross-sectional area of the fibre. The fabric closeness values are 
>
 72% for the contact fabric and 45-68% for the filter fabric. In addition to reducing the production costs, the use of hollow fibres also makes it possible to produce lighter fabrics. These show themselves to advantage in a higher functional reliability of the airbag.
