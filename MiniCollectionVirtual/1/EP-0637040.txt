<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical capacitor with a fuse which does not produce flames or burst. This fuse comprises a special thermal fuse (1), which is connected in series with the winding (3) in one of the supply lines (2) thereof. At a specific temperature, which is critical for the safety of the capacitor, a thermal metal (4) in the fuse melts and solidifies at the ends of the current-carrying wires (5), forming spheres. The melted-away points are sealed in an insulating manner by a chemical compound (6), situated in the fuse body. By this means, the current path is irreversibly isolated. The current interruption is free from restriking and independent of position.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical capacitor provided with a flameproofing and burstproofing fuse unit
which is interconnected in one of two lead-in wires (2) to the capacitor winding (3) in

which fuse a low melting metal (4) after melting is solidifyed to a spheroidal form at
the ends of the current-carrying wires (5) and these ends are insulated by a

chemical composition (6) in a manner which is irreversibly breaking the current path
so that in the case of a thermal overload of the capacitor a current interruption

without arcing back is secured in any position of the capacitor, characterised in that
said fuse is a hermetically sealed thermal overload protection fuse (1) and the

response temperature thereof is chosen in such a manner that it corresonds to the
temperature on the capacitor surface at which the capacitor is to switch off for safety

reasons.
Electrical capacitor provided with a flameproofing and burstproofing fuse
according to claim 1, characterised in that the thermal overload protection fuse is

mounted at such a site within the capacitor housing where the temperature rise is
acting immediately whereby the time lag between the occurrence of a damage risk

and the switching-off of the capacitor is reduced.
