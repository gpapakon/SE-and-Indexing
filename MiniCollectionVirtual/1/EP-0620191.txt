<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for purifying untreated waste water (effluent) with nutrient elimination, in particular municipal waste water, in a biological treatment plant using a biomass composed of microorganisms which is brought into contact with the untreated waste water in an activated sludge tank (1) and then, in a secondary clarification tank is separated from the purified waste water which flows off from the secondary clarification tank, while at least some of the biomass, together with the influent untreated waste water (2) is fed to the activated sludge tank in the vicinity of the bottom, 9 - 12 kg of biomass (DM) being contained in the activated sludge tank per m

 of tank volume, the biomass being mixed under turbulent conditions with the substances contained in the untreated waste water to form a sludge/water mixture and being first denitrified (I) in a lower oxygen-free region, then the sludge/water mixture passing into the upper region of the tank and, with addition of oxygen (11) at certain points, being nitrified (III).

A device for purifiying especially municipal 
wastewater in a biological purification plant having at 

least one activated sludge tank (1) and a secondary 
settling tank for separating the biomass from the 

purified wastewater, with the raw water, together with 
the returned sludge, being added to the activated sludge 

in the vicinity of the base, while there is formed a 
turbulent flow in a denitrification zone (7) and with an 

elongated activated sludge tank (1) with flow reversing 
means arranged at the longitudinal ends containing a 

plurality of flow walls (3a, b) shaped like segments of 
a circle,
 
characterised in 


that a supply line (2) for the raw wastewater and for 
the returned sludge is arranged in the vicinity of the 

base of the tank (1); 
that the flow walls (3a, b) are secured at the base of 
the activated sludge tank by means of one wall underside 

each, whereas the opposed upper wall edge projects from 
the wastewater and that, at the flow wall (3b), there 

are arranged wedge-shaped flow means (20), as a result 
of which the sludge/water mixture is lifted at the 

run-out end (8) and transferred into a nitrification 
zone (6) with two wastewater treatment zones arranged 

one above the other;  
 
that the flow walls (3a, b) are arranged so as to be 
offset relative to the axis of symmetry of the tank 

(1), that by means of the front edge (9) with reference 
to the direction of flow, the flow wall (3a) which, in 

a plan view, has the shape of a semicircular segment, 
is closer to the tank edge than by means of the rear 

flow edge, and that the run-out end (8) of the flow wall 
(3b) is arranged at a greater distance from the tank 

edge than the opposed run-in edge; 
and that introducing means (11) for introducing oxygen 
in a point-like way are arranged transversely to the 

direction of flow in the activated sludge tank (1) 
directly behind the flow wall (3a).
