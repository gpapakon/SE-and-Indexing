<ABSTRACT>
A load cell (1) has a load sensing member (2) on wich are mounted strain gauges comprising circuit elements (18, 19) of a thick film circuit of which a surface portion of the member constitutes a substrate. The circuit elements are arranged in concentric circular arrays (18, 19) and are oriented so as to be responsive to radial compression or tension due to bending of the surface portion of the member. The load cell can be used in a suspension unit of an automotive vehicle to measure a component of load directed at right angles to the surface portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "LOAD CELL"This invention relates to a load cell and in particular but not exclusively to a load cell for a suspension unit of an automotive vehicle.It is known to provide load cells for obtaining load measurements in the form of electrical signals either for monitoring the load in structural members or to generate feedback signals as part of a control circuit. The suspension units of automotive vehicles have been provided with such load signals as part of active suspension systems in which the instantaneous load experienced by each suspension unit of the vehicle is detected to allow optimum control of actuators determining suspension characteristics.Typically in such arrangements a load sensing member is connected between first and second load bearing structures and strain gauges are bonded to the member such that load transmitted between the structures via the member results in strain being observed in the member which can be sensed by means of the gauges to provide an output signal representative of the load.Typically it is required to sense a component of load in a specific direction and in order to minimise interference from stresses associated with unwanted components it is known to provide an array of strain gauges which are accurately and symmetrically positioned. The output of the gauges is then processed typically using a bridge circuit.The need for accurate bonding of an array of strain gauges to the load sensing member has hitherto resulted in such load cells being expensive. It has also proved to be difficult to manufacture load cells which are insensitive to loads in directions other than the specific direction of interest. 

 According to the present invention there is disclosed a load cell comprising a plurality of strain gauges mounted on a load sensing member whereby in use the strain gauges facilitate measurement of strain produced in the member in response to an applied load, wherein the strain gauges comprise circuit elements of a thick film circuit of which a surface portion of the member constitutes a substrate.An advantage of such a load cell is that a thick film circuit printing technique may be utilised to accurately and repeatedly position the circuit elements on the load sensing member.Preferably the surface portion of the load sensing member is annular so as to extend radially between an outer annular portion of the member connected in use to a first load bearing structure and an inner annular portion of the member connected in use to a second load bearing structure, the
