<ABSTRACT>
ZSM-22 zeolite which is particularly pure and whose synthesis does not require the synthesis mixture to be stirred can be produced by the addition to the synthesis mixture of a small quantity e.g. 1000 ppm, of preformed ZSM-22 zeolite seed crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing ZSM-22
zeolite, a particularly pure form of ZSM-22 zeolite which
may be produced by this process, and a process for using the
zeolite as a catalyst in the preparation or conversion of an
organic compound.During the 1980's a novel class of high silica
aluminosilicate zeolites was identified. Zeolites denoted
THETA-l, Nu-10, KZ-2, ISI-l and ZSM-22 all show very similar
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns corresponding
approximately to the following pattern:INTERPLANAR SPACING D (Å)INTENSITY I/Io10.90 ± 0.240(M-VS)8.70 ± 0.1610(W)6.94 ±0.1013(W-M)5.40 ± 0.088(W)4.58 ± 0.0710(W)4.36 ± 0.07100(VS)3.68 ± 0.0597(VS)3.62 ± 0.0565(S-VS)3.47 ± 0.0446(M-S)3.30 ± 0.045(W)2.74 ± 0.023(W)2.52 ± 0.0219(W)For simplicity, the following text will refer to such a
zeolite as a ZSM-22 zeolite.Processes for preparing such a zeolite are described in a
number of documents. In general, the synthesis mixture
comprises a source of silicon (or germanium); a source of
aluminium (or alternative T-atom such as gallium, boron;
iron, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, arsenic, antimony or
manganese); a source of monovalent cation (such as an
alkali metal) and an organic structure directing agent.
This mixture is crystallised to form the zeolite.US Patent No. 4481177 describes the production of ZSM-22
conducted in an autoclave stirred at about 400 rpm.EP-A-65400 describes the production of a zeolite denoted
Nu-10 by crystallising a synthesis mixture and indicates
that agitated reactions are preferred since if the
agitation is inadequate or the reaction is carried out
under quiescent conditions there is a distinct probability
of contamination with a ZSM-5 zeolite. EP-A-87017
describes the production of a zeolite denoted ISI-l in
which a synthesis mixture is crystallised while stirring.
EP-A77624 describes the production of zeolite denoted Nu-10.
Agitation is said to be preferable and there are no
examples of a preparation in which agitation does not
occur. Although a rubidium compound is added to the
stirred synthesis mixture in some instances and this is
stated to encourage the formation of ZSM-22, the present
applicants have found that if the process is repeated
without stirring during crystallisation the product is a
mixture of amorphous material and ZSM-5. The rubidium
containing material does not therefore compensate for the
need to stir vigorously the mixture during
crystallisation. EPA 116 203 and EPA 220 893 disclose the synthesis of ZSM-22 zeolites in stirring,
yet neither
