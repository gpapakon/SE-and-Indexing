<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a plate-link chain for continuously variable cone pulley gearing, in which the plate assemblies forming the chain links and made up of three plates are connected to one another in articulated fashion by pins (3), the spacing (7, 9) of the chain links between the joints being made varied in a regular or irregular manner by the use of different basic types of plate. In this arrangement, the basic types of plate associated with an increased spacing or projecting into the latter are provided with an extension (12) in the direction of running of the chain on at least one of their two radial end webs (11).

<CLAIMS>
Plate-link chain for continuously variable conical pulley 
gearing, whose plate stacks, which form the chain links and 

are assembled in a triple-plate connection, are connected 
together in an articulated manner by pins (3), which chain 

comprises thrust pieces, which act transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the chain for transmitting 

frictional force between the conical pulleys and the plate-link 
chain, wherein the pitch spacing (7, 9) of the chain 

links between the hinge points differs in a regular or 
irregular manner through the use of appropriately different 

basic plate types (1, 10), characterised in that the basic 
plate types (1, 10), which relate to an increased pitch 

spacing (9) and project into the latter, are provided at at 
least one of their two radial end webs (11) in the 

longitudinal direction (8) of the chain, with a widened part 

(12) which extends between the consecutive plates, possibly 
up to the hinge pins (3) which adjoin outside of the 

plates. 
Plate-link chain according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the widened part (12) is formed as an externally 

rounded lug (14) which is disposed in the region of the 
longitudinal centre of the radial end webs (11).
