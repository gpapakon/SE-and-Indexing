<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a connecting device for the electrical and mechanical connection of conductor elements and for carrying the cooling liquid to and from the hollow conductors (5) of the stator winding bars (3) of electrical machines, the hollow conductors (5) and, if necessary, the solid conductors (4) of the winding bar in the winding overhang are combined in a metallic component (7). This component is connected to a water chamber (2) which is in turn provided with connecting fittings (6, 11) for feeding the cooling liquid in and out and is surrounded by an insulating sleeve (10). In order to shorten the installation time (assembly time), said connecting device comprises a preferably U-shaped insulating part (10) which is pushed from the centre of the stator over the metallic component (7), the water chamber (2) and over the connecting fittings (6, 11) and overhangs the latter radially. Means (17, 19 and 12a, 12b respectively) for filling the spaces between the metallic component and the U-shaped insulating part (7) as well as between the connecting fittings and the U-shaped insulating part are provided both in the region of the metallic component and in the region of the connecting fittings, which means at the same time ensure that the insulating sleeve is held firmly.
