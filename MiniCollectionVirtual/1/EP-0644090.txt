<ABSTRACT>
A trailer unit for an articulated vehicle, which trailer 
unit has a raisable and lowerable front end ground support, 

and a security system which includes a key operable switch 
(12, 14) enabling operation of a motor for driving the 

ground support, the switch (12, 14) being incorporated into 
an electrical circuit which includes a battery (58) and an 

alarm device (62, 64) which is operated if an attempt is 
made to raise or lower the ground support without insertion 

of a key in the key operable switch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ground supports for 
articulated vehicles. Articulated vehicles comprise a tractor unit and a trailer 
unit disconnectable at a releasable coupling device. 
Before disconnecting the tractor from the trailer, it is 
necessary to lower a ground support, in the form of a stand 
which may or may not be equipped with dolly wheels, beneath 
the trailer towards the front end thereof. The invention 
is concerned, more specifically, with this lowerable and 
raisable ground support. Currently, when disconnecting or reconnecting a tractor and 
trailer, the driver or other operator has to lower or raise 
the ground support by means of a hand winch, which is 
operated by use of a detachable cranked handle from a 
standing position adjacent the side of the trailer. This 
system is disadvantageous, extending disconnection and 
connection times to at least several minutes. Sometimes, 
moreover, the driver, on coming to use the winch, finds the 
detachable handle damaged or that it has been totally 
mislaid. Moreover, in an endeavour to save time, there is 
risk that the ground stand will be raised to the minimum 
level necessary for normal ground clearance, whereby the 
risk remains of grounding at humps in the road, as at level 
crossings or bridges, and the risk of pulling the ground 
support through the snow arises on snow laden roads. Motor powered ground supports have been proposed, but have  
 
not found commercial viability, possibly because, unless 
made suitably secure, it is possible that a motorised 
drive will only make it easier for a thief to raise the 
support in preparation for theft of the complete trailer. PCT Publication No. WO 92/05981 seeks to overcome this 
problem in a motor powered ground support by means of a 
key operable lock which preferably operates mechanically, 
but may act electrically to cut off the electric supply 
from the tractor battery to the driving motor. In the 
latter case, however, assuming the tractor has been driven 
away, it is relatively easy for a potential thief to 
connect up a battery brought to the trailer for the 
purpose in order to be able to raise the ground support 
preparatory to theft of the complete trailer. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved 
system for lowering and raising the front end ground 
support of the trailer of an articulated vehicle. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
trailer unit for an articulated vehicle also having a 
tractor unit, the trailer unit having a

<CLAIMS>
A trailer unit for an articulated vehicle also 
having a tractor unit, the trailer unit having a 

lowerable and raisable front end ground support, characterised 
in that the trailer unit also has a security system 

which includes at least one key operable switch (12, 14) 
enabling an electric motor to raise or lower the ground 

support when the tractor unit is connected, the switch 

being connected in electrical circuitry which includes a 
battery(58) and an alarm signalling device (62, 64) and 

forms part of the security system of the trailer, the 
security system also including means (68, 70) whereby the 

alarm signalling device is actuated if an attempt is made 
when the tractor unit is disconnected to raise the support 

without insertion of the key or keys in the at least one 
key operable switch. 
A trailer unit according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the security system also includes a motor/gear box 

unit (44) able to drive the ground support, said drive 
unit being operable to drive the legs to their lowermost 

limit in the event of the motor being powered without 
operation of the at least one key operable switch (12, 14). 
A trailer unit according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the motor circuit includes a relay (68) having a 

contact (70) in the power supply to the alarm signalling 
device whereby, when the motor is powered, power is also 

supplied to the alarm signalling device. 
A trailer unit according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the electrical circuitry also includes a second 

relay (54) which also has a contact (56) in the power 
 

supply circuit to the alarm signalling device (62, 64), 
said second relay being operated if the at least one key 

operable switch (12, 14) is short circuited. 
A trailer unit according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that two key operable switches (12, 14) 

are provided, one operable by a conventional key and one 
by a magnetic card key. 
A trailer unit according to claim 5, characterised 
in that the magnetic card key is personalised, at least 

to the company owning the trailer unit, and is readable by 
a card reader, so that the magnetic card switch (14) is 

not operated unless the card is correctly read. 
A trailer unit according to claim 5 or claim 6, 
characterised in that the switch (12) operable by a 

conventional key is a three-way switch which reverses 
the motor/gear box power supply to drive the ground support 

up or down (the motor being a reversible d.c. motor), and 
also has an off position. 
A trailer unit according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the power supply circuit to the 

alarm signalling device also includes any one or more of 
the following:- 


a) a mercury switch which is operated if the trailer 
unit is driven away with the ground support in the 

lowered position; 
b) a switch (76) which is operated if an operating panel 
of the security system is forced or broken into; 
c) a switch operable by a light sensor behind the 
operating panel; 
d) a heat sensor switch (78) which is operated if a heat 
detector at the ground support detects that heat is being 

generated due to an attempt to cut off the legs of the 
ground support; and 
e) a key operable reset switch (82) for the alarm 
signalling device. 
A trailer unit according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the alarm signalling device 

comprises any one or more of:- 

a) a visual and aural alarm (62, 64); 
b) a signal-transmitting pager for alerting the owner or 
driver; and 
c) a VHF tracker. 
A trailer unit according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that a power supply from the tractor unit 

is fed to the trailer unit through the cable which also 
provides lighting to the trailer unit. 
A trailer unit according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the ground support is equipped with 

up and down limit switches (16, 18) and, in the down 
direction, a ground pressure switch (20), by means of which 

the power supply to the motor is broken when a limit or 
pressure switch is operated, the operation of the pressure 

switch preceding that of the down limit switch, which latter 
 

is such that it will raise the trailer unit out of reach 
of a tractor unit.
