<ABSTRACT>
A support with ball (8) for moving loads, of the type 
comprising a hollow body to which the load is applied 

and in which a ball is haused, partially coming out from 
the lower part of said hollow body and free to rotate by 

means of a plurality of rolling means (7) assembled inside 
said hollow body engage the surface of the ball, 

characterized in that at least one of said rolling means (5) 
is positioned on the upper side of the ball and is 

assemblied on a support able to freely pivot around a 
vertical axis passing through the ball center.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention proposes a support in which 
houses a ball that acts as a wheel; this support allows 
to easily move a load with translation, angular motion 
or both. Several different types of wheels are known, applied to 
objects which necessitate to be translated and/or to be 
rotated, such as handtrucks, chairs, or white goods. Generally these are wheels having a substantially 
horizontal pivot which are mounted on a fork hinged to 
a vertical pivot which is applied to the object to be 
moved. The two pivots are misaligned and this allow the 
changing of the movement direction. This system shows some drawbacks, particularly when 
several wheels are applied to the mobile object. Actually hardly all the wheel are oriented on the same 
direction, as a consequence, when the movement direction 
is to be changed very quickly several difficulties are 
met. In other cases, on the contrary, the wheel comprises 
a ball housed inside a seating which covers it 
partially, but the friction between the ball and the  
 
seating make it hardly usable. DE-A-1 926 180 discloses, a support with ball (1) for moving loads, of the type 
comprising a hollow body (2) to which the load is applied and in which a ball 
(1) is housed, partially coming out from the lower part of said hollow body (2) 
and free to rotate by means of a rolling means (3) which are assembled inside 
said hollow body (2) and engage the surface of the ball (1), wherein said 
rolling means (3) is positioned on the upper side of the ball (1) and is mounted 
on a support able to freely pivot around a vertical axis passing through the 
ball center. The present 
invention proposes a ball support according to the features 
of claim 1. The support, according to the invention, provides a 
plurality of wheels, opportunely arranged inside 
the support, which allow the ball to freely rotate, thus 
avoiding the abovementioned drawbacks. The present invention will be further described, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig.1 is a cross-sectional view of the device according 
to the invention; Fig.2 is a low sectional view of said device. The support is a hollow body which is integral with an 
upstanding member 1 which is attached to a mobile 
object. In the upper side of the cavity of said hollow body a 
fork 3, whose axis is alligned with ball centre 8 and 
with the contact point B, is provided. A wheel 5 is applied to the fork 3, by means of a 
pivot 4. The support 2 contains a plurality of wheels 7 
which idle on as many pivots 6.

A support with ball for moving loads, of the type 
comprising a hollow body (2) to which the load is 

applied and in which a ball (8) is housed, partially 
coming out from the lower part of said hollow body and 

free to rotate by means of an idle wheel (5) 
positioned on the upper side of the ball and mounted 

on a support formed as a fork (3) able to freely pivot around a 
vertical axis passing through the ball center, 

characterized in that the support provides also at 
least three coplanar idle wheels (7) and in that the pivot 

axes (6) of said three coplanar idle wheels (7) are misaligned of 
90Â° relative to the pivot axis of the fork (3), so 

that said wheels (7) rotate on the ball surface 
forcing the ball (8) to remain centered in the cavity of the 

support.
