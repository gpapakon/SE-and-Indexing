<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyester/polycarbonate
blends having improved low temperature
impact strength and processability. More particularly,
this invention relates to a thermoplastic molding
composition containing an aromatic carbonate polymer, a
poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) (PCT)
resin, and a copolyester which consists essentially of
repeat units from mixtures of isophthalic acid,
terephthalic acid and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.Polycarbonate is a useful engineering plastic for
parts requiring clarity, toughness and heat resistance.
However, polycarbonate also has deficiencies which
include poor chemical and stress crack resistance, and
poor processability. One method to improve these
properties is to blend polycarbonate with another resin,
a useful family of such resins being thermoplastic
polyesters. Until now, however, such polycarbonate/
polyester blends were able to increase processability
only by decreasing impact strength.Blends of polycarbonate with a copolyester derived
from mixtures of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid
with 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol are disclosed in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,188,314 and 4,391,954. Such patents are
directed to two component thermoplastic molding
compositions containing an aromatic polycarbonate and a
polyester resin derived from cyclohexanedimethanol and a
mixture of iso- and terephthalic acids. U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,146, is directed to a three
component polyester/polycarbonate blend containing a
poly(alkylene terephthalate), a polycarbonate and a
polyester carbonate copolymer. The polyester carbonate
copolymer is obtained by copolymerization of an alkylene
terephthalate oligomer, preferably a polyethylene
terephthalate oligomer, and a carbonate oligomer. The
use of such oligomers is said to improve the
crystallinity index of the compositions and thereby
maintain such characteristics as chemical resistance
without relying on the addition of other components
which decrease impact resistance.In contrast, the present invention relates to a
blend comprised of a polycarbonate of
4,4'isopropylidenediphenol (bisphenol A polycarbonate),
a poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate)
resin, and a copolyester which consists essentially of
repeat units from mixtures of isophthalic acid,
terephthalic acid and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The
present inventors have unexpectedly determined that a
copolyester may be incorporated into blends to increase
the processability of the blends without decreasing
impact strength if a polyester is added in
