<ABSTRACT>
A clutch hydraulic slave cylinder (16) comprising a cylinder body (14), a primary piston (41) sealingly reciprocable relative to the body and co-operating with the body to form a first fluid chamber (60) within said body, and a secondary piston (70) sealingly reciprocable relative to the primary piston (41) and co-operating with the primary piston to form a second fluid chamber (80). The second fluid chamber (80) is connected to the first fluid chamber (60) through a valve means (82). The primary piston (41) is biased by spring means (54) from a fully retracted condition to an "at-rest" condition in which it can exert a pre-load on a clutch bearing, and said valve means (82) is open when the primary piston is in the fully rectracted condition and is closed when the primary piston (41) is in the "at-rest" condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clutch hydraulic slave cylinders 
for use with clutch hydraulic actuators, particularly for 
use with motor vehicle friction clutches. A problem with hydraulic clutch actuator systems is that as 
the vehicle clutch plate wears the hydraulic slave cylinder 
piston is returned to a different position in the cylinder 
housing. Therefore the working volume of the slave cylinder 
must be sufficient to accommodate the changes in actuator 
fluid volume within the slave cylinder as the piston 
"at-rest" position changes due to clutch driven plate wear, 
together with the volume of fluid displacement by the master 
cylinder when the clutch actuator system is operated. Various attempts have been made to provide fluid pressure 
operated actuators which compensate for clutch wear. For 
example, EP-A-0310733 discloses a pneumatic/hydraulic 
actuator in which a primary piston is biased to a fully 
retracted condition so that an associated wear compensation 
valve opens and closes with each actuation of the 
associated. Whilst such an actuator performs adequately it 
has certain operational problems in not being able to apply 
a constant preload force to the associated clutch release 
bearing and also experiencing a short delay in the operation 
of the clutch whilst the compensation valve closes on the  
 
initial movement of the primary piston. With the developing trend towards more compact component 
parts in vehicle engine compartments it may be advantageous 
to reduce the overall size of a clutch slave cylinder. The present invention provides a hydraulic slave which is 
axially compact, which can apply a constant bearing preload 
force and act without delay. Accordingly there is provided a clutch hydraulic slave 
cylinder comprising a cylinder body, a primary piston 
sealingly reciprocable relative to the body and cooperating  
 
with the body to form a first fluid chamber within said body, 
and a secondary piston sealingly reciprocable relative to the 
primary piston and co operating with the primary piston to 
form a second fluid chamber, the second fluid chamber being 
connected to the first fluid chamber through a valve means 
characterised in that the primary piston is biased by spring 
means from a fully retracted condition to an "at-rest" 
condition in which it can exert a pre-load on a clutch 
bearing, and said valve means is open when the primary piston 
is in the fully retracted condition and is closed when the 
primary piston is in the "at-rest" condition. Preferably the
