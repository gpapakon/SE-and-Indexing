<ABSTRACT>
A linear-array detector for application particularly in dental X-ray diagnostic devices is introduced, which contains a detector (35), sensitive to X-rays, which is held in a housing (16), which detector contains a multiplicity of detector elements which are arranged such that they form one or more lines and their contacts are connected to control lines which are fed to a connection part (20) which contains electrical and mechanical connection means (21, 23; 22, 24) for releasable connection to a correspondingly designed holder (15) of the X-ray diagnostic device (Figure 1, Figure 2).

<CLAIMS>
A line detector camera (4) intended for being connected to a holder (15) which
is arranged diametrically opposite to the x-ray source (3) of an x-ray

diagnostics installation (2) for generating object exposures of a patient, having
the following features:


the camera has an elongated housing (16) which, in a surface (17) facing
the x-ray source, has a longitudinally extending slot (18) therein for the

entry of x-rays;
an x-ray sensitive detector (35) is disposed behind the slot (18), said
detector (35) having a plurality of detector elements arranged to form one

or several line(s);
the contacts of the detector elements are connected to control lines which
are carried to a connector part (20) disposed at an end of the housing (16);
the connector part (20) contains electrical and mechanical connector
means (21, 23, 22, 24) for a releasable connection to the correspondingly

designed holder (15) of the x-ray diagnostics installation (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).
A line detector camera according to claim 1, wherein the connector part (20)
further includes an interlock mechanism (21, 23) for preventing unintentional

release from the holder (15).
A line detector camera according to claim 1, wherein the housing (16) and/or
the holder (15) contain centering means (30, 31) for fixing the housing (16) or

parts thereof in a defined position relative to the holder (15).
A line detector camera according to claim 3, wherein the centering means is
given by forming the outer shape of the camera housing (16) in such a way

that there is an unmistakable relation between the connector part (20) and the
holder (15) of the x-ray diagnostics installation. 
A line detector camera according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the outer
shape of the housing (16) is that of a multi-cornered hollow tube at whose one

end face the connector part (20) is disposed.
A line detector camera according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the end face
(19) containing the connector part (20) acts in combination with an auxiliary

device (26) attached to the holder (15) which is designed in such a way that
the connector means are axially released from each other upon actuation of the

auxiliary device (26).
A line detector camera according to one of claims 1 to 6, which has a hollow-tube
housing (16) of a defined length approximately corresponding to the

width of a human skull, wherein the housing (16) has a longitudinally
extending slot (18) in a side wall (17) facing the x-rays, behind which a CCD

sensor with a scintillator layer is disposed as a detector (35) inside the
housing, and wherein at least one control circuit board (38) for driving the

CCD sensor, containing electrical components, is contained in the hollow-tube
housing (16).
A line detector camera according to claim 7, wherein the housing (16) is
shaped as a rectangular hollow tube preferably having a square cross section.
A line detector camera according to claim 7, wherein the CCD sensor is
attached to a carrier (36) which is braced to the one control circuit board (38)

with retainer clamps (37).
A line detector camera according to one of claims 1 to 9, further comprising a
safety catch means to be attached to the holder (15) for preventing

unintentional dropping after release of the connector means (21-24).
A line detector camera according to one of claims 7 to 10, wherein the
detector (35) and/or the control circuit board (38) are/is mounted in the

housing (16) by means of a shock-absorbing damping means (34).
A line detector camera according to one of the preceding claims, in
combination with a PAN and/or Ceph device (Fig. 1/2).
