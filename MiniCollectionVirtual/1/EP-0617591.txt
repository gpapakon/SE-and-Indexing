<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a coagulation probe with an elongated hollow-cylindrical main body (12) through which a guide rod (16) passes, a handle (22) at the proximal end of the main body (12) and a heating device (18) at the distal end of the main body (12). The heating device (18) surrounds the main body (12) or is designed as an extension to the main body (12) and is also hollow-cylindrical in shape.

Coagulation probe, in particular for the uterine area, 
comprising a heating device (18) and a handle (22),
characterized
 in that
 
an elongated, hollow cylindrical main body (12) is 

provided which can be penetrated by a guide rod (16),
 
that the handle (22) is located at the proximal end of 

the main body (12) and the heating device (18) at the 
distal end of the main body (12) and
 
that the heating device (18) surrounds the main body 

(12) or is located in extension of the main body (12) 
and is also hollow cylindrically constructed. 
Coagulation probe according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that
 
the handle (22) is offset or arranged axially with 

respect to the main body (12). 
Coagulation probe according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that
 
the offset angle is 90Â°.  

 
Coagulation probe according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the internal diameter of the bore (14) of the hollow 

cylindrical main body (12) is larger than the external 
diameter of the guide rod (16). 
Coagulation probe according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the heating device (18) consists of a copper tube surrounding 

the main body (12) and having grooves for receiving 
of heating wires. 
Coagulation probe according to one of the claims 
1 to 4,
characterized
 in that
 
the heating device (18) consists of two rings arranged 

in axis-normal manner relative to the longitudinal 
axis of the main body (12) and that heating wires passe 

between the rings. 
Coagulation probe according to one of the claims 5 
and 6,
characterized
 in that
 
the heating wires are coated with nickel silver. 
Coagulation probe according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the heating device is Teflon-coated.  

 
Coagulation probe according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the leads (26) for the heating device (18) are located 

in the jacket of the hollow cylindrical main body (12). 
Coagulation probe according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the main body (12) has a thermally insulating guiding 

device (28) for the guide rod (16). 
Coagulation probe according to one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized
 in that
 
the guiding device is formed by centering rings (28). 
Coagulation probe according to claim 11,
characterized
 in that
 
the centering rings (28) are made from thermally insulating 

plastic or ceramic.
