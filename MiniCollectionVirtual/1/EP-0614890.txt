<ABSTRACT>
The optionally 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazoles of the general formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 are novel intermediates for the preparation of antihypertensive pharmaceuticals (vasodepressants) or of herbicidally active compounds. There are described a process for the preparation of these intermediates and a novel process for the further reaction of optionally 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazoles of the general formula I in which R
<
1
>
 is hydrogen to give the optionally 2-substituted 5-chloroimidazole-4-carbaldehydes of the general formula

denotes hydrogen, a straight or branched C
1
-C
6
 alkyl 
group, a cyclopropyl-, cyclobutyl-, cyclopentyl- or 

cyclohexyl group or a benzyl group or phenyl group 
optionally substituted with halogen atoms, alkyl, 

nitro and/or amino groups, characterised in that in 
a first step a glycine ester hydrohalide of the 

general formula 

 
wherein R
1
 has the meaning defined above, R
2
 denotes 
an alkyl group and X stands for a for a halogen 

atom, is reacted in a first step with an imido-acid 
ester of the general formula  

 

 
wherein R has the above-mentioned meaning and R
3
 
denotes an alkyl group in the presence of a base to 

give the corresponding optionally substituted 3,5-dihydroimidazol-4-one 
of the general formula 


 
wherein R and R
1
 have the said meanings and is 
chlorinated in a second step to give the end 

product. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that an alkali hydroxide or an alkali alkoxide is 

used as base in the first step. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that in the first step the reaction is carried 

out in a pH range between 7 and 12. 
A process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the reaction components of the first step, 

that is the glycine ester hydrohalide, the 
imidocarboxylic ester and the base are reacted in a 

stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1. 
A process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that in the first step the reaction temperature 

lies between -20째C and 50째C.  
 
A process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that in the second step the chlorination is 

carried out with thionyl chloride or phosphorus(V) 
oxychloride. 
A process according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the chlorination is carried out with 

phosphorus(V) oxychloride at a temperature between 
20째C and 110째C.

formula 


 
in which R is n-butyl, 2-butenyl or 3-butenyl.
