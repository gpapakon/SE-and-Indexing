<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum machine for sucking up the ballast of a railway track has two ballast stores (17, 18) which each have their own sucking-in and discharge opening (35, 36) and to which is assigned a suction pipe (10) for sucking in the ballast. For selective airtight closure, in each case at least one sucking-in opening (35, 38) is assigned its own closure member (44, 45). Alternate emptying of the ballast stores (17, 18) can thus be carried out without interrupting the sucking-in activity.

A suction machine for removing bedding ballast of a 
track by suction, comprising a machine frame (4) designed to 

travel on on-track undercarriages (2), a vacuum generator (3) 
and a ballast store (17,18) having a suction and a discharge 

opening (35-38,19), a suction pipe (10) with a suction 
opening (16) designed for immersion in bedding ballast and 

vertically and transversely adjustable by means of drives 
(13) being associated with the suction opening (35,36) of the 

ballast store (17,18), characterized in that two ballast 
stores (17,18) are provided, each having its own suction and 

discharge opening (35,36,19), a separate sealing element 

(44,45) being associated in each case with at least one 
suction opening (35-38) of each ballast store (17,18) to 

produce an optional air-tight seal. 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
separate drive (42,43), operable by way of a central control 

unit (6), is associated with each sealing element (44,45) for 
moving it over into a sealing position, the control unit (6) 

having an OR-switching element for operating the relevant 
drive. 
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in that 
a sealing element (45) is associated with another suction 

opening (37,38) provided in each case as a connection between 
the ballast store (17,18) and an adjoining filter chamber 

(20), the said sealing element comprising its own drive (43) 
which is also operable by the OR-switching element (51). 
A machine according to one of claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the suction pipe (10) is secured to an  

 
inlet opening (46) of a distributor (33), the two outlet 

openings (47) of which, situated at the opposite end in the 
suction direction, are each connected to a suction opening 

(35,36) of a ballast store (17,18). 
A machine according to claim 4, characterized in that in 
the region of the inlet opening (46) of the distributor (33) 

there is associated therewith a deflector (49), movable by 
means of a drive (48), for selectively diverting the suction 

stream from one outlet opening (47) to the other. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that associated with each suction opening 

(35) is a stop valve (53) which is mounted so as to be 
movable by means of the drive (42) perpendicularly to a 

longitudinal axis of the suction pipe (10) or to the suction 
stream direction. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that all the drives (42,43,48,50) serving to 

move a sealing element (44,45), the discharge openings (19) 
and if appropriate the deflector (49) are operable by means 

of the OR-switching element (51) of the central control unit 
(6). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
one end (32) of the suction pipe (10) adjoining the suction 

opening (35,36) is mounted so as to be movable by means of a 
drive (55) from a suction opening (35,36) associated with the 

first ballast store (17,18) to a second suction opening 
(35,36), situated at a distance therefrom, associated with 

the second ballast store (17,18).  
 
A machine according to claim 8, characterized by a 
connecting link guide (56) joining the two suction openings 

(35,36) together, in which a flange (57), connected to the 
end (32) of the suction pipe (10) and to the drive (55), is 

mounted so as to be movable transversely to the longitudinal 
direction of the machine or to the suction stream direction. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that a level indicator (52) is associated 

with each ballast store (17,18) for recording a maximum 
filling level, the said indicators being connected to the 

control unit (6) to activate the OR-switching element (51).
