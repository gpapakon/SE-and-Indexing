<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multilayers of thermoplastic
materials, more particularly to thermoplastic
fluorinated polymers coextrusion with thermoplastic polymers
to obtain multilayer structures.It is known in the art the coextrusion of numerous
thermoplastic materials to form multilayer coextruded articles
showing the advantages of the different properties of
the various thermoplastic materials forming the multilayer.The thermoplastic fluorinated polymers can be extruded
or moulded to form extruded articles such as films, plates,
pipes, cables or moulded articles in general, for their excellent
chemical, electrical and barrier properties.Nevertheless it is difficult to coextrude the fluorinated
polymers to form multilayer extruded articles due to the
difficulty of the fluorinated polymers to adhere to other
non-fluorinated thermoplastic materials.The fluorinated thermoplastics are polymers showing an
excellent chemical resistance, high barrier properties and
electric insulation properties and due to these features are 
used in the chemical industry to stock and to transport chemical
products and in the effluent treatment.Nevertheless they show a lower mechanical resistance
compared to the non-fluorinated thermoplastic polymers.Therefore it was felt the need to prepare multilayer
structures coupling fluorinated and non-fluorinated thermoplascics
to obtain a combination of the properties of both these
materials.The problem to solve is therefore to find a good adhesive
which permits to obtain a good adhesion in the processing,
moulding, extrusion of the fluorinated thermoplastics
with non-fluorinated thermoprocessable polymers.From the USP 4,677,017 it is known to prepare multilayer
films comprising at least a layer of thermoplastic fluorinated
polymer, selected among HALARR (ethylene/chlorotrifluoroethylene
(ECTFE) copolymer), ETFE (ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene
copolymer), tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoropropene copolymers
(FEP), and at least a layer of a thermoplastic polymer
selected from: polyamides, ethylene/vinylalcohol copolymers,
wherein the adhesive is selected from ethylene/vinyl/acetate
copolymers, olefin/esters copolymers, olefin
copolymers containing carboxylic groups.The Applicant has now found that these adhesives show
adhesion at low temperatures but are less effective when 
they are used at very higher temperatures.From EP-A-523,644 it is known a plastic laminate having
an aliphatic polyamide layer and a fluorinated resin layer
using as adhesive middle layer a blend of an aliphatic
