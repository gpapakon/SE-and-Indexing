<ABSTRACT>
Non-immunogenic enzyme compositions which have been isolated from antarctic krill and exhibit both endo- and exo-peptidase activity, are useful for the manufacture of medicaments and pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of a great variety of diseases in humans and animals such as infections, inflammations, cancers, HIV/AIDS, pain, polyps, warts, hemorrhoids, plaque, wrinkles, thin hair, allergic itch, anti-adhesion, eye diseases such as cataract, glaucom, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new pharmaceutical uses of non-immunogenic
proteinaceous substances and compositions which have enzymatic activity
and which in a great number of clinical tests surprisingly have proven to provide
a cure for an amazingly great variety of diseases. According to the the invention
it is believed that these substances function in a phagocytosis-like manner, i.e.
they seem to be able to distinguish between various particles and soluble matter
regarded to be "normal" or "abnormal", respectively, in a particular environment
or, differently expressed, seem to be able of recognizing, targeting and destroying
divergent cells. It should, however, be emphasized that the invention is not
intended to be restricted by any hypothetic mode of action expressed in the
present specification.One traditional way of looking upon proteolytic enzymes for medical use is
to use them for cleansing of non-healing wounds covered with proteinaceous structures
as an alternative to surgical debridement, mainly in elderly patients with
ulcera caused by circulation insufficiencies. See e.g. US-A-4,801,451 and US-A-4,963,491,
which disclose a mixture of exo- and endopeptidase enzymes which
have been isolated from antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) and its use for cleaning
purposes, both pharmaceutical cleaning (US-A-4,801,451) and non-pharmaceutical
cleaning (US-A-4,963,491). The only disclosed pharmaceutical cleaning is enzymatic
debridement, viz. enzymatic cleansing of necrotic wounds. Disclosed uses
for non-pharmaceutical purposes are i.a. as laundering agents, for renovation of
old paintings etc. WO 85/04809 discloses the use of enzymes from antarctic krill
as a digestion promotor. EP-A1-0170115 discloses the use of krill as a thrombus
dissolvent.Enzymes and enzyme mixtures derived from antarctic krill have been
isolated and extensively studied as regards their biological and biochemical
properties. Various procedures for isolating these enzymes have also been
developed. See e.g. Anheller J-E., Hellgren L., Karlstam B. and Vincent J. (1989):
"Biochemical and biological profile of a new enzyme preparation from Antarctic
krill (E. superba) suitable for debridement of ulcerative lesions", Arch. Dermatol.
