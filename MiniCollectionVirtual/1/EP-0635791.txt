<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a small computer system interface device capable of 
transmitting data between a central digital data processing device (30) and an 

external device (60) without the need for terminal resistors coupled between the 
SCSI and the central digital data processing device. A pair of data buses each 

containing equal number of data lines (33) supply data to a protocol controller (41) 
which identifies the number of data lines being used to transfer data and then 

transfers the supplied data to a disk drive unit using the full number of data lines 
provided by said pair of buses. When the number of bus lines used is less than that 

provided by both buses, the protocol controller signals a level setting circuit (42) to 
set the number of bus lines unused by the external device to transfer data from the 

central digital processing device inactive so as to allow the throughput of data 
between the digital processing device, SCSI and disk drive unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a level setting circuit
applied to an interface device, such as a small computer
system interface, which controls data transfer. More
particularly, this invention relates to a semiconductor
interface device which can keep the voltage level of extra bus
lines at an inactive level when the width of a bus, i.e., the
number of bus lines, differs from the bus width of an
apparatus that is to be connected to this semiconductor
interface device.In order to process digital information, as for example with
microprocessors, data must be transferred between or among
various type of information processing apparatuses. This is
most commonly done by connecting these apparatuses with a bus
cable. Many times however, the apparatuses, among or between
which data is transferred, have varying bus widths. When this
occurs, the apparatus having the larger number of bus lines
in effect has bus lines unused by the apparatuses having
smaller numbers of bus lines. If those unconnected bus lines
are left in a floating state where no H-level or L-level
signal is input, that semiconductor device cannot adequately
receive a predetermined number of bits of data necessary for
its operation. In these cases terminal resistors are commonly
used to set the voltage level of any unconnected bus lines to
that of an inactive state. In this way, a predetermined
number of bits of data are able to be input to the
semiconductor device, so that this semiconductor device will 
properly function.Fig. 1 shows a conventional information processing system.
This system has a personal computer 10 and a SCSI (Small
Computer System Interface) unit 20 that can be used for
example with an optical disk drive. Both the personal
computer 10 and the SCSI unit 20 are connected by a SCSI bus
cable 16.The computer 10 includes a controller 11, a bus
driver/receiver 12 and a bus 13. The bus 13 includes eight
bus lines. The bus 13 is provided with a pair of connectors
14 and 15. The bus driver/receiver 12 is connected to the bus
13 and to the controller 11. The controller 11 operates to
receive 8-bit parallel data from the bus 13 via the bus
driver/receiver 12, and executes predetermined processing
based on the received data. The controller 11 also outputs
8-bit parallel data onto the bus 13 via the bus
driver/receiver 12.The SCSI unit 20 includes a controller 21, a bus
driver/receiver 22 and a main bus 23. The main bus 23 has
first and second sub-buses 24 and 25 each including eight bus
lines. Thus, the bus 23 has a total of sixteen
