<ABSTRACT>
A method for stripping aromatic hydrocarbon 
contaminants from wastewater by contacting the wastewater 

counter-currently with stripping gas. The stripping gas 
is passed over a bed of activated carbon (13) to regenerate the 

stripping gas for recycling to the stripping vessel (20). 
There is no purge of stripping gas or aromatic 

hydrocarbons to the atmosphere. The removed aromatic 
hydrocarbons are retained by the activated carbon and 

periodically recovered. An activated carbon particularly 
adapted for retaining and recovering aromatic hydrocarbons 

is derived from bituminous coal and has 60 to 90% of its 
pore volume provided by macro pores of radius over 200Å 

and meso pores of radius 50Å to 200Å.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to environmental pollution
control. More particularly, the invention relates to a
method for removing and recovering volatile contaminants
from wastewater. Most particularly, the invention relates
to the use of activated carbon to adsorb aromatic
hydrocarbons.A variety of technologies have been developed and
utilized to remove volatile contaminants such as
hydrocarbons from chemical plant and refinery wastewater
in order to render it safe for discharge into the surface
and ground water supply. These technologies have been
driven by the discovery that water sources proximate to
industrial areas have become contaminated with volatile
organic compounds such as benzene, toluene, 
chlorinated and halogenated solvents and other compounds derived
from petroleum.A common method used in the petroleum industry for
removing volatile organic compounds has been to air strip the
wastewater in a packed tower. The wastewater is stripped in a
vertically oriented tower at atmosphere pressure. Contaminated
wastewater is pumped into the upper portion of the packed tower
and cascades downwardly through liquid-gas contacting media
referred to in the art as packing. In the alternative, a series
of contacting trays may be substituted for the packing. Air is
forced upwardly through the packing by means of a blower or fan
to volatilize organic compounds. The contaminant free wastewater
is collected at the bottom of the tower and is removed for
disposal consistent with any remaining contamination. The
contaminant laden air is released from the top of the tower to
the atmosphere. In the alternative, the air is collected and
purified to reduce hydrocarbon content before release to the
atmosphere.A number of methods have been developed for separating
hydrocarbon for pollution control. U. S. Patent 4,054,429 to
N. Ostojic et al. teaches a method and apparatus for recovering
solvent from a gas such as air. By the method, solvent
contaminated air is passed through an oil absorber which absorbs
the solvent, producing a clean air product. The oil-solvent 
mixture is stripped with inert gas to produce a solvent free oil.
The remaining inert gas-oil mixture is separated by first
condensing the oil and then passing the inert gas through an
activated charcoal filter which removes last traces of solvent
from the inert gas. Cleaned inert gas is returned to the
stripper for recycle in the oil-solvent stripping stage.U.S.-A-3,876,505 to G. R. Stoneburner discloses a method
of making granular activated carbon from bituminous
