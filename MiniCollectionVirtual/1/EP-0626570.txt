<ABSTRACT>
A system to determine fluid level in a tank using several 
tubes extending to different levels in the tank. Gas pressure 

in the tubes needed to release bubbles from the exit ends of 
the tubes indicates the hydrostatic head at the exit ends. A 

control unit compares the pressures in the tubes to find the 
highest fluid immersed bubbler tube. The proportion of fluid 

above the immersed tube is calculated from the pressure and 
added to the height of the immersed tube to get the total 

fluid depth. A spring loaded fixed length member, magnetically 
attached to the bottom of the tank, reliably secures the 

exit ends of the tubes at known fixed vertical locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves fluid level measuring systems of 
the type that use the pressure needed to bubble gas from a 
tube into the fluid as an indicator of the pressure of the 
fluid at the tube outlet depth, which pressure is, in turn, 
dependent on the height of the fluid level above the bubbler 
tube outlet. Bubbler tubes comprise a superior way to measure the 
level of liquids because no mechanical apparatus needs to be 
immersed in the fluid. Reliability is enhanced and maintenance 
reduced, especially with corrosive, sticky, viscous, or otherwise 
difficult fluids. However, accuracy may suffer if the 
pressure is not correctly determined. A number of factors can 
generate errors in the pressure measurement and the prior art 
includes a number of proposed designs to insure better determination 
of the fluid pressure. For example, United States Patent 5,115,679, to Uhlarik, 
teaches making the bubbler tube horizontal at its outlet tip 
so that the gas/liquid interface remains at the same vertical 
height when it moves somewhat within the bubbler tube as the 
pressure stabilizes. This insures that one is measuring the 
pressure at a known height location rather than the pressure 
at a somewhat higher location where the gas/liquid interface 
has been pushed by the fluid pressure. But even if one has an 
accurate pressure reading at a known location in the tank, the 
height of the liquid above that location cannot be calculated 
unless the weight of the liquid per unit volume, compared to 
water, that is, the specific gravity, is also exactly known. 
This is not always the case. Even common fluids like water 
vary in specific gravity depending on mineral content and  
 
temperature. Fluid mixtures vary their specific gravity over 
time as more volatile constituents evaporate off. To solve this problem, United States Patent 2,613,535, to 
Born, teaches the use of two bubbler tubes, vertically 
separated by a fixed distance, to establish the pressure differential 
over this fixed distance and calculate therefrom the 
actual specific gravity of the fluid. Thereafter, the level 
of the fluid can be calculated from the pressure sensed by the 
lower of the two bubbler tubes. Similar solutions are 
proposed in United States Patent 4,669,309, to Cornelius, 
United States Patent 4,006,635, to Khoi, and United States 
Patent 4,630,478, to Johnson. All of these prior art approaches 
fail to overcome certain inherent problems with 
fluids, however. No measurement of the density (specific gravity) of a 
fluid, no
