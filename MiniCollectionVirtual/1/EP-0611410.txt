<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relate to a door jamb finger guard. Injuries are often caused, especially to children, by 
fingers being trapped between a door and a door stop or a 
door jamb and guards have been proposed in the past which 
comprise a web of plastics material stretched over the gap 
between and door and the door jamb when the door is open. 
It is essential in such guards that they be naturally sprung 
away from the hinge so as to push away any obstacle as the 
door closes. A guard is known from GB-A-2,218,449 which comprises two 
strips that are hinged to each other and flexibly connected 
to the door and door jamb long their free edges. The 
disadvantage of such a guard is that the width of the strips 
depends on the thickness of the door and on the opening 
angle (90°-180°). To suit all doors and opening angles a 
variety of guards must be manufactured and stocked. The invention seeks to provide a finger guard for a door 
jamb which can fit a wide range of doors and which has a 
neat appearance when the door is closed. According to the present invention, there is provided a door 
jamb finger guard comprising four elongate strips which are 
sequentially hinged to one another along their long edges, 
each of the free long edges of the first and fourth strips 
being pivotably connected to a long edge of a respective one 
of two further elongate strips one of which, in use, is 
secured to the door and the other to the door jamb and the  
 
first strip being wider than the fourth strip so as to force 
the strips to lie against one another when the door is 
closed. The four strips can be folded in the manner of a ladies' fan 
to lie against one another when the door is closed and form 
a web extending across the gap between the door and the door 
jamb when the door is open to act as a finger guard. Because 
four strips are used to bridge the gap, the total width of 
the finger guard when the door is closed is smaller than 
that required in a guard with only two strips and a neater 
appearance is thereby achieved. Though the prior art does not explicitly show any finger 
guards having more than two strips reference, GB-A-2,119,838 
refers implies without any elaboration that more that two 
strips can be used. For example, Claim 5 of the publication 
refers to "at least two strips intermediate the end strips". 
There is however no teaching to use four and only four 
strips, as proposed in the present invention. In practice, 
using more than four strips is not satisfactory because the 
web becomes too

<CLAIMS>
A door jamb finger guard comprising four elongate 
strips (10,12,14,16) which are sequentially hinged to one 

another along their long edges, each of the free long edges 
of the first (10) and fourth (16) strips being pivotably 

connected to a long edge of a respective one of two further 
elongate strips (18, 20) one of which, in use, is secured to 

the door (26) and the other to the door jamb (24) and the first 
strip (10) being wider than the fourth strip (16) so as to 

force the strips (10,12,14,16) to lie against one another 
when the door (26) is closed. 
A finger guard as claimed in claim 1, further 
comprising a separately formed mount (40) which in use is 

secured to a frame (42) surrounding the door (26), the mount 
(40) having a channel for receiving one of the two further 

strips (20) of the finger guard and serving to hold the 
strips parallel to the surface of the door when the door is 

closed. 
A finger guard as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
four strips (10,12,14,16) and the two further strips (18,20) 

are formed integrally of plastics material with film hinges 
between the individual strips.
