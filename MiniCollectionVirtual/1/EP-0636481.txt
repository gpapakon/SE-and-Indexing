<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid-jet printing head
which operates for printing by ejecting a printing liquid by
utilizing thermal energy so that a flying droplet of the
printing liquid is formed, and a liquid-jet printing
apparatus having the liquid-jet printing head. The present
invention is applied to printing of ink on various ink
supporting members (recording members), such as cloth,
strings, paper, and other sheet-like members, and to various
information processors or to printers provided as output
units of information processors.In liquid-jet printing systems, various means are used
to eject a printing liquid such as ink through a head so
that the ejected ink is attached to an ink supporting member
such as paper, thereby performing printing.Low-noise, high-speed and high-density printing can be
achieved if a liquid-jet printing apparatus using this kind 
of printing system is used. Moreover, such a printing
apparatus can be reduced in size and can be mass-produced
easily and at a low cost, because it requires no
development and fixation steps with respect to plain
paper. Liquid-jet printing apparatuses have attracted
attention because of these advantages.An example of an ink jet recording apparatus is that
disclosed in US-A-4317124. This document discloses an
ink jet recording apparatus comprising a plurality of
liquid channels provided on a substrate each for
supplying liquid from a common liquid chamber to a
respective ejection outlet. The liquid channels are
symmetrical in a plane parallel to the substrate about
an axis passing from the common liquid chamber to the
ejection outlet. The liquid channels increase in width
from the aperture connecting to the channel to the common
liquid chamber to a maximum width in the middle of the
channel, before decreasing in width to another minimum
forming the ejection outlet. A respective heating
resistor element is provided on the substrate in each of
the liquid channels. Each of the heating resistor
elements can apply heat to liquid in its respective
liquid channel to generate a bubble in the liquid so that
liquid is ejected from the respective ejection outlet of
the liquid channel. In particular, on-demand type liquid-jet printing
apparatuses do not require a high-voltage generating unit
and an unnecessary-ink recovery unit, such as those required
by continuous type liquid-jet printing apparatuses, and can,
therefore, be reduced in overall size. It is therefore
believed that they will find promising applications.Among apparatuses of this kind, a
