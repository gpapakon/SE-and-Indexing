<ABSTRACT>
A module which fits into a cup attached to the 
bottom of an automotive fuel tank (16) contains a fuel pump 

(14), a fuel filter (108), a jet pump (80) and associated 
manifold components (20) for maintaining a minimum level of 

fuel in a reservoir (12) to provide a continuous source of 
fuel to the fuel pump (14) when the tank fuel level is low 

or when vehicle operations, such as cornering, braking, 
acceleration, or slope parking cause the tank fuel level to 

fall below the fuel pump inlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to motor vehicle fuel pump 
senders, and specifically to means for maintaining a 
sufficient fuel level at the fuel pump inlet. Fuel tanks, particularly in automobiles, typically 
contain a fuel pump which may be mounted on the bottom of 
the tank. It is desirable to position the inlet of the fuel 
pump as near as possible to the lowest level in the tank so 
that a source of fuel will be available even when fuel level 
is low. Despite such a placement of the fuel inlet, events 
during vehicle operation such as cornering, braking and 
acceleration can cause the fuel to "slosh" around, 
potentially uncovering the fuel pump inlet. Driving or 
parking on a slope could similarly result in the fuel pump 
inlet being uncovered. When the inlet is exposed, the fuel 
pump sucks air (or fuel vapour) causing the engine to stammer 
and stall. An additional problem occurs at engine start-up 
when fuel tank level is low and there is insufficient fuel 
at the pump inlet. Various methods have been devised to solve the 
above mentioned problems. Damming means which form a 
reservoir within a cylinder in the tank to keep fuel 
covering the fuel pump inlet was disclosed in U.S. Patents 
4,397,333 and 4,503,885. Those patents also disclosed a jet 
aspirator to continually draw fuel into the reservoir. The 
reservoirs in these devices are relatively small and the jet 
aspirator does not keep the cylinder filled after the engine 
is turned off since fuel leaks out through the fuel return 
conduit. Thus, the level of fluid available at engine 
start-up is limited to that in the reservoir. Another method for providing fuel to the fuel pump 
intake is to induce fuel into a reservoir by directing 
return fuel over a ramp past an opening in the reservoir. 
Several patents disclose variations on this method, 
including U.S. Patent 4,899,784. However, fuel will leak  
 
out of the swirl pot of this device when vehicle operation 
ceases. U.S.-A- 5,139,000 discloses an automotive fuel system 
including a reservoir having upper and lower chambers on 
opposite sides of a partition in the reservoir, a high 
pressure fuel pump having an inlet connected to the lower 
chamber, a low pressure fuel overage return pipe returning 
overage fuel directly to the lower chamber and a jet pump 
transferring fuel from the tank directly to the upper 
chamber. A drain in the partition conducts gravity induced 
fuel flow from the upper chamber to the lower chamber. According to the present invention there is provided 
a fuel

draw fuel from the fuel tank (16) into a fuel outlet 
chamber, through a vertically positioned reservoir outlet 

conduit (92) within said reservoir (12) and into said 
reservoir, with said reservoir outlet conduit (92) arranged 

such that said reservoir outlet conduit is above a fuel 
inlet of said fuel pump (14), said reservoir remaining filled 

to a minimum height of said conduit outlet when said fuel 
pump (14) and said engine cease operation.
