<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and process for 
aluminothermic welding without preheating of metal parts, 
with rising channels and central part of welding cavity 
controlling such process and with ventilating means for 
eliminating of gases. In aluminothermic welding without preheating of two or more 
identical or similar metal parts of variable cross-sections, 
such as rails, aligned in an end-to-end relation, several 
methods are known in which the amount of heat required to weld 
the rail ends is supplied solely by the liquid steel aluminothermically 
produced. However, no method is known in which the stress applied to 
the weld head is decreased by increasing the moment of inertia 
of cross-section of weld and by increasing a height between 
the weld base and the neutral axis of weld while the moment of 
fatigue of weld base and the moment of fatigue of weld head 
are so balanced as to obtain an increase of the endurance of 
the weld employed.  At the same time, a single method is known in which the 
area of the cross-section of a rising channel varies along 
said channel in such a manner that areas in the longitudinal 
section of different portions of a channel are proportional 
to areas of corresponding portions of rail. In one such process and apparatus, described in 
Romania Pat.No. 80,214, the rail ends are positioned with a gap 
therebetween and enclosed in a welding mold, which contains 
stepped rising channels, connecting gates and ventilating ducts. 
After a casting crucible is manually tapped, a single liquid 
stream flows into the welding cavity centrally through the gap 
and fills the welding cavity and the rising channels. However, 
this method is subject to several disadvantages. Because the two 
cores used in employing the rising channels are in an inter-dependent 
relation, the rising channels are not sufficiently 
large in the region of rail head, and the rail head would not be 
properly melted. Also, technical difficulties are encountered 
when the stepped rising channels are to be employed with 
inter-dependent cores. This method requires large spaces around 
metal parts for eliminating of gases from the base portion and 
the web portion of welding cavity during the pouring operation, 
such that this method does not employ a weld without rib and 
further finishing in the region of weld web is required. Also, no such welding apparatus and method without preheating 
of rails is known in which the space around the metal parts in 
the region of web portion of the welding
