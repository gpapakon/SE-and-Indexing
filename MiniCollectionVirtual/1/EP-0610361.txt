<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
inclusion in a ship to reduce vibrations in the ship's 
hull and to a ship incorporating such an apparatus. The 
present invention additionally relates to a method of 
reducing vibrations in a ship's hull. It is widely accepted that hull vibrations are 
capable of giving rise to significant stresses within the 
structure of a ship which may, in time, lead to structural 
fatigue and ultimately structural failure. The elmination 
or reduction of these vibrations is therefore of 
considerable interest to ship designers. Hull vibrations span a very large frequency range 
from the movement of the ship in the seaway through the 
low frequency hull girder vibrations and the various forms 
of engine vibration to the higher frequency local 
vibrations. The means used to eliminate or reduce these 
vibrations are similarly diverse. The movement of a ship 
in the seaway, for example, is generally counteracted by 
the use of stabilisers of which the Denny-Brown is 
probably the best known design offered commercially. The 
design relies on the use of hydrofoils on either side of 
the ship which provide moments that compensate for the 
action of the waves and thereby reduce the rolling of the 
ship. Hull girder vibrations on the other hand, have 
until recently been thought to be caused exclusively by 
excitations from the main engines, propellors and other 
machinery contained within the ship. In particular it has 
been thought that these vibrations were predominantly 
excited by the primary and secondary out of balance of the 
main engine. Balanced main engines have therefore often 
been fitted to ships to minimise these hull girder 
vibrations, commonly in combination with a Nishishiba 
balancer which is used to balance the second order out of 
balance of the main engine.  
 More recently however, a better understanding of 
the importance of wave excitation has been developed and 
it is now recognised that lower modes of hull girder 
vibration may also be excited by the action of waves. In 
a recent experiment conducted during a ship's sea trials a 
wave-excited, two node mode of vibration was detected at 
the after end of the ship's hull having an amplitude of 
1.78mm and a frequency of 1.48Hz, and this on a day when 
the weather was good and the sea relatively calm. It was 
calculated that the detected vibration gave rise to a 
nominal vibration stress in the deck of 2.5N/mm2 while 
further measurments suggested that the speed of the ship 
was adversely affected.
