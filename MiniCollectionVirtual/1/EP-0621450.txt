<ABSTRACT>
In a method for heating service water by heating up and storing heating water as well as heating the service water by heat exchange with the heating water, the heating water and the service water are led to the heat exchange in counterflow. An apparatus suitable for carrying out the method has at least one heat generator (10) and an accumulator (12) which is downstream thereof, for heating up and storing heating water, as well as a heat exchanger, downstream of the accumulator (12), for heating the service water by means of the heating water. In this process, the service water is heated by passing through a counterflow heat exchanger (14). The service water to be heated is brought to exactly the correct use temperature in a continuous-flow process. By contrast with service water heating systems of conventional design, the peak readiness is kept not on the service water side but in the accumulator. This entails, inter alia, the advantage that in the case of a high peak demand this system is more cost effective than a service water heater of conventional design and the same output. The apparatus is suitable, in particular, for heating service water in alternative energy systems, as well as in large systems such as homes, hospitals, superstructures and sports installations.
