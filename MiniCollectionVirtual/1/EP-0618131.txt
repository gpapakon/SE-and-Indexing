<ABSTRACT>
A novel twin hull boat equipped with a pair of hydrofoils 3 
and 4 comprising; a plurality of independently driven auxiliary 

wings 5/5 and 6/6 respectively being secured to both ends of a 
front hydrofoil 3 and a rear hydrofoil 4 secured to the bottom of 

the hull 1; a height sensor 11 for measuring height of the stem 
form water surface; a pair of inertia sensors or gyroscopes 13A 

and 13B for detecting rolling and pitching angles of the hull 1; a 
wing-angle sensor 10 for detecting angles of the auxiliary wings 

5/5 and 6/6; and a controller 14 for controlling height of the 
stem constant, preventing the front hydrofoil 3 from coming out 

of water surface, and also controlling rolling and pitching 
behaviors of the hull 1 by driving the auxiliary wings 5/5 and 6/6 

in accordance with a specific control mode selected by control-mode-setting 
switches 21 and 22.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a twin-hull boat
which is equipped with a plurality of hydrofoils and
capable of cruising itself afloat at a high speed.Today, any of conventional surface-piercing type
hydrofoil boats is equipped with a plurality of hydrofoils
submergibly extended below the stem and the stern so that
the boat can cruise itself at a high speed by way of
decreasing hull resistance via proper function of hydrofoils
for sustaining the hull lifted out of the water.Nevertheless, according to the concept of such
conventional surface-piercing type hydrofoil boat, since
part of hydrofoils is extended above the water surface and
constantly hit by waves while the boat cruises itself, so-called
sea-worthiness remains poor, and in addition, since
the hull itself cannot properly be stabilized against
rolling effect generated by beam waves, cruising comfort
cannot fully be provided.In Hovering Craft and Hydrofoil, vol. 14, No. 6, March
75, p. 23-27, M.G. Shperling, "Comprehensive Automation
Control System for Soviet Hydrofoil Craft Taifun" a
hydrofoil boat is described. This boat is equipped with a
front hydrofoil and a rear hydrofoil below the bottom of a
hull comprising a plurality of independently driven
auxiliary wings being secured to left and right ends of said
front and rear hydrofoils. A center of gravity-height
sensor is secured to the stem of the hull in order to
measure height from said stem to water surface. An inertia
sensor detects rolling angle of the hull. A controller unit
controls height of said stem to be constant and rolling 
behaviour of said hull by way of driving the auxiliary
wings. However, the hull of the known boat is of the type
with hydrofoil units whose lift forces result in the hull
being lifted out of the water. The invention on the other
hand concerns boats with hydrofoils which navigate under the
displacement mode, i.e. that cruise without causing the twin
hulls to come out of the water.Therefore, a primary object of the invention is to
provide a novel twin-hull boat equipped with a plurality of
hydrofoils, which is capable of sustaining satisfactory sea-worthiness
and providing improved cruising comfort.To achieve the object, the novel twin-hull boat
according to the invention is equipped with a plurality
of hydrofoils below the bottom plate corresponding to
the stem and the stern of the bull. Structurally, a
plurality of independently driven auxiliary 
wings are provided at both-end domains of each hydrofoil. A
height position sensor is provided on the top surface
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A twin-hull boat equipped with a front hydrofoil
(3) and a rear hydrofoil (4) below the bottom of a hull (1),

the bottom of which is under the water surface while the
boat is navigating at a cruising speed, comprising


a plurality of independently driven auxiliary wings
(5/5 and 6/6 respectively) being secured to left and right

ends of said front and rear hydrofoils (3 and 4),
a height sensor (11) secured to the stem of said hull
(1) in order to measure 
height from said stem to water
surface,
at least one inertia sensor or a gyroscope (13A) for
detecting rolling angle of said hull (1) based on the center

of motion of said hull (1) and
a controller unit (14) for controlling height of said
stem to be constant and rolling behaviour of said hull (1)

by way of driving said auxiliary wings (5/5 and 6/6) based
on a stem-height-detect signal from said inertia sensor or

gyroscope (13A).
A twin-hull boat as set forth in claim 1, further
comprising a pair of inertia sensors or gyroscopes (13A and

13B) for detecting rolling and pitching angles of said hull
(1) based on the center of oscillation of said hull (1).
A twin-hull boat as set forth in claim 1 or 2,
further comprising


a bearing measuring unit (12) for measuring actual
bearing of said hull (1) and
a computing unit (15) for measuring actual speed and
bearing of said hull (1) based on hull positional data

detected by said bearing measuring unit (12),
 
   wherein, based on data related to actual speed and

bearing of said hull (1) computed by said computing unit
(15), said controller unit (14) corrects rolling angle of

said hull (1) detected by said inertia sensor or gyroscope
(13A) and/or corrects pitcing angle of said hull (1)

detected by said inertia sensor or gyroscope (13B).
