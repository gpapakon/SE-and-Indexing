<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns the cloning and sequencing of DNA corresponding to the GA1 locus of A. thaliana which encodes ent-kaurene synthetase, to vectors containing said DNA, to vectors capable of expressing said DNA, and to hosts transformed with said vectors. The invention further concerns the use of the GA1 gene, and regulatory regions thereof, in the generation of chimeric and transgenic plants.

 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONRECOMBINANT GIBBERELLIN DNA AND USES THEREOFCross-Reference to Related Patent ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/844,300 (filed February 18, 1992) which is a continuation-in- part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/688,525 (filed June 7, 1991) 5 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/280,866 (filed December 7, 1988), all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.Field of the InventionThe invention pertains to recombinant DNA technology. Specifically, 10 the invention relates to cDNA and genomic DNA corresponding to the GAl locus of Arabidopsis thaliana which encodes e/tf-kaurene synthetase, expression vectors containing such genes, hosts transformed with such vectors,>.Î› the regulatory regions of the GAl gene, the use of such regulatory regions to direct the expression of operably-lin ed heterologous genes in transgenic 15 plants, the GAl protein substantially free of other A. thaliana proteins, 

antibodies capable of binding to the GAl protein, and to methods of assaying for the expression of the GAl gene and the presence of GAl protein in plant cells and tissues.Background of the InventionA. GibberellinsGibberellins (GAs) are a family of diterpenoid plant growth hormones required for seed germination, leaf expansion, stem elongation, flowering, and fruit set. GAs have been the subject of many physiological, and biochemical studies, and a variety of plant mutants with altered patterns of GA biosynthesis or response have been studied (Graebe, J.E. , Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 38:419- 465 (1987)). However, none of the genes involved in GA synthesis have yet been cloned.One of the most extensive genetic studies of GA mutants has been carried out by Koornneef et al. (Theor. Appl. Genet. 5S.257-263 (1980); Koornneef et al., Genet. Res. C mb. 41:51-6 (1983)) in the small crucifer, Arabidopsis thaliana. Using ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) and fast neutron mutagenesis, Koornneef has isolated nine alleles mapping to the GAl locus of A. thaliana (Koornneef et al. (Theor. Appl. Genet. 55:257-263 (1980); Koornneef et al , Genet. Res, Camb. 41:57-68 (1983)). A. thaliana gal mutants are non-germinating, GA-responsive, male- sterile dwarfs whose phenotype can be converted to wild-type by repeated application of GA (Koornneef and van der Veen, Theor. Appl. Genet. 58:257- 263 (1980)). Koornneef et al. used three independent alleles generated by fast neutron bombardment (31.89, 29.9 and
