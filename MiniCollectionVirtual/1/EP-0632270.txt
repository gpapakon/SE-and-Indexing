<ABSTRACT>
An accurate, rapid and simple method for assaying the activity of blood coagulation factor XIII and a reagent kit for use 
in said method. The method comprises mixing a specimen with a fibrin deposit inhibitor and optionally further with fibrinogen, 

adding a thrombin solution to the resultant mixture, measuring the fibrin clotting time in the presence of calcium ions, and comparing 
the measured time with the standard fibrin clotting time. The reagent kit is composed of thrombin, calcium ions, a fibrin 

deposit inhibitor, and optionally further fibrinogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
determining activity of blood coagulation factor XIII 
(hereinafter referred to as factor XIII) and a kit of reagents 
for the determination. The factor XIII is also referred to as fibrin 
stabilizing factor. It is a protein playing a part in the 
promotion of acquiring the resistance to fibrinolysis and 
forming adhesion carriers of fibroblasts. When activated by 
thrombin and calcium ion, the factor XIII causes cross-linking 
reaction between fibrin molecules and between fibrin and other 
proteins by transglutaminase reaction during the terminal 
stage of the blood coagulation reaction to form stable fibrin 
clots and the like. Normally, this protein exists in blood 
in an inactive form, but when blood coagulation is caused by 
hemorrhage or the like to form thrombin, it is activated by 
the action of thrombin and calcium ion to stabilize fibrin.  Therefore, although a normal threshold of blood 
coagulation time is seen in the case of a decrease or lack in 
the factor XIII in blood, the resulting fibrin clots are weak 
and show a tendency to delay healing of wounds in addition to 
characteristic phenomena such as posthemorrhage and the like. 
The decrease or lack in the factor XIII are seen in, for 
example, congenital deficiency, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC), serious hepatic diseases, malignant tumor, 
leukemia, acquirers of a factor XIII inhibitors, major 
operations or the like. Therefore, the determination of the 
factor XIII is of importance in diagnosing diseases or 
evaluating therapeutic effects. It is required to establish 
a method of determining the factor XIII accurately, quickly 
and easily. However, prior art methods of the determination are 
not satisfactory for this need. The following methods are 
known as conventional methods of determining the factor XIII: 
qualitative methods by clot dissolution which test whether 
clots (fibrin clots) formed by plasma coagulation are soluble 
in a diluted acid solution (e.g., 1% monochloroacetic acid, 
etc.) or a urea solution (5-8 mol/l); semiquantitative methods 
by clot dissolution after antibody neutralization or serial 
dilution; other immunological methods; quantitative methods 
by amine uptake utilizing the transglutaminase activity of the 
active factor XIII (e.g., Nippon Rinsho, vol. 47, a special  
 
1989 number, p. 846-848; Rinsho Kensa, vol. 27, No. 8, p. 848-853 
(August 1983)). However, accurate activity of the factor 
XIII is not determined by qualitative or
