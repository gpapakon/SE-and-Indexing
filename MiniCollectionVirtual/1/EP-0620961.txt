<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC CAMERA AND CAMERA APPARATUS USING SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a camera apparatus that includes multiple electronic cameras and control apparatus, and to an electronic camera that can be connected to the control apparatus via a communication path.Description of the Prior Art In a conventional electronic camera arrangement the user presses a shutter button to take a photograph, or the camera is connected to a controller, such as a computer, which activates the camera shutter. There is known a technique of using a computer control arrangement in which the shutter button is activated in accordance with command signals issued by the computer. Figure 5 shows an arrangement of a camera apparatus that uses a conventional electronic camera. In this arrangement an electronic camera 100 and a computer 101 are connected by a computer interface 102, and the electronic camera 100 is activated by command signals transmitted from the computer 101 via the computer interface 102, and the computer interface 102 is also used to send image data back to the computer 101. While the computer interface 102 is used for data communication between the electronic camera 100 and the computer 101, communication signals are not differentiated by the interface itself. 

 This arrangement has drawbacks when it is necessary for multiple electronic cameras to be controlled by one computer. When, for example, electronic cameras are installed on roads so that cars exceeding the speed limit can be photographed for identification purposes, it is necessary to photograph the driver's face and the number plate as well as the shape of the car. Because a single camera is not able to photograph all these items, it is necessary to use multiple electronic cameras activated according to a set sequence. A computer is used to control these multiple cameras, but as in the conventional arrangement the electronic cameras are not able to determine whether or not a particular command signal is intended for that camera or another camera, all of the cameras are operated by one command signal, making it impossible to activate the cameras according to a set sequence. Thus, it has not been possible to realize a camera apparatus whereby multiple electronic cameras are controlled by a computer.In another case, multiple electronic cameras are installed on a production line which is controlled by a single computer that also monitors the quality of the products being manufactured.

<CLAIMS>
 What is claimed is:
1. An electronic-camera camera apparatus that includes multiple electronic cameras, a control apparatus that connects the multiple electronic cameras via a wired or wireless communication path and has command means that activates the multiple electronic cameras by the transmission via the communication path of command signals tagged with an identification number of an electronic camera to be activated, wherein each electronic camera has its own identification number and thereby only executes a command contained in a transmitted command signal which is tagged with an identification number that is recognized as being its own identification number by identification means that determines whether or not an identification number contained in a transmitted command signal is the identification number of that camera.
2. An electronic camera that executes a command contained in a command signal transmitted from a control apparatus that is tagged with an identification number, the electronic camera having its own identification number and including identification means that determines whether or not an identification number 


 contained in a transmitted command signal is the identification number of that camera, and camera control means which executes a command contained in a transmitted command signal that is tagged with an identification number that the identification means has recognized as being its own identification number.
3. An electronic camera that executes a command contained in a command signal transmitted from a control apparatus that is tagged with an identification number, the electronic camera having an electronic camera unit that generates image data and includes a camera mechanism that has camera functions, and a coupling unit that connects to the electronic camera unit, has its own identification number and includes identification means that determines whether or not an identification number contained in a command signal is its own identification number, and means for transmitting to the electronic camera a command signal tagged with an identification number that is recognized as being its own identification number, whereby the electronic camera executes a command contained in a command signal received from the coupling unit that has been recognized by the coupling unit as being tagged with its own identification number. 


 4. The electronic camera according to claim 2, in which the electronic camera transmits image data tagged with its own identification number to the control apparatus.
