<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field of
electronic noise rejection, and more particularly, relates
to methods and apparatus for minimizing the effects of
electromagnetic interference on physiological measurements.Electronic monitors are currently used to measure
various physiological parameters (e.g., blood pressure,
heart rate, EKG, temperature) of patients during surgical
procedures in the operating room (OR) and during care in
intensive care units (ICUs). However, other electronic
equipment in use in the OR or ICU (e.g., electrocautery or
electrosurgical devices) can generate electrical
interference which corrupts the measured signals and
invalidates the displayed numeric readings and waveforms.
Present monitors incorporate various means for minimizing
this interference in EKG and blood pressure waveforms, but
systems used to measure temperature and cardiac output
remain susceptible to this type of interference.A known method for performing cardiac output (CO)
measurements employs heat and pulmonary artery catheters
and relies upon the continuous measurement of pulmonary
artery temperature and heater power to accurately compute
cardiac output. For example, such a method is described by
Yelderman in U.S. Patent No. 4,507,974 and McKown et al. in
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 510,897, filed April 18,
1990. The delicate CO measurements made by such
instruments must be free of corruption by electrical
interference if these instruments are to be used reliably
in the clinical setting. Unfortunately, since the most 
common source of electrical interference (electrocautery
devices) can be used for prolonged periods of time and in
an unpredictable fashion in the OR or ICU, the clinician
cannot obtain reliable measurements at critical times
without asking the surgeon to stop his or her procedure to
allow the measurements to stabilize. Since time is of the
essence in these procedures, interference of this type must
be compensated or eliminated if the afore-mentioned CO
measurement devices are to provide accurate measurements.
The present invention has been provided to reject such
electrical interference.EP-0 126 931 describes an apparatus for measuring flow through a
fluid system in which a heating element driven by a stochastic generator
introduces heat into the system which is detected by a thermistor and high
gain amplifier. There is no teaching of electrical isolation of any
components in order to minimize electrosurgical interference. Accordingly, a primary object of the present

A method for substantially eliminating the effects of electrosurgical
interference on continuous, heat-based cardiac output (CO) measurements,

comprising the steps of:

(a) supplying power via an isolation transformer (12) and carrier
frequency to a catheter-mounted heating element (16) associated with a

patient for whom the CO measurement is to be obtained;
(b) measuring a voltage (Vm) and a current (Im) on a primary
side of the isolation transformer;
(c) determining a voltage (Vs) and current (Is) on a secondary
side of said transformer on the basis of the measured primary side voltage

and current;
(d) determining the power (P_he) delivered to and resistance
(R_he) of said catheter-mounted heating element on the basis of the

secondary-side voltage and current;
(e) determining a heater power waveform on the basis of said

heat input into the patient as a result of the power supplied to the cathode-mounted

heating element;
(g) determining, on the basis of said signal, a second waveform
representative of said response as a function of time; and
(h) determining a system transfer function by cross-correlating
said heater power waveform with said second waveform, said system

transfer function being both substantially uncorrupted by said
