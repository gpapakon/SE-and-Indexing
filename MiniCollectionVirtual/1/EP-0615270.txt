<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the manufacture of demagnetisation coils intended to be mounted on the glass surround of cathode-ray tubes for colour image display. The subject of the invention is a manufacturing method in which the join between the ends (1, 2) of the winding (12) of the demagnetisation coil and the conductors (4, 5) for connection to the electrical supply circuit is encased by injecting an insulating thermoplastic into a mould. The invention applies in particular to demagnetisation coils for colour television receivers (sets).
