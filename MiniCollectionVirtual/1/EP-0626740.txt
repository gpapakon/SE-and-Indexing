<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dispersive optical delay line for frequency-modulated lightwave pulses, in particular laser waves. The delay line according to the invention comprises a first optical grating R1 and a second optical grating R2 which are parallel, separated by a distance d and located with a pitch (separation) a on the surface of a material of index N which is transparent to the light waves. An incident wave  SIGMA  is diffracted at an angle theta ' which is greater than the critical angle of refraction by transmission through the gratings R1 and R2, the angle of emergence of the second grating R2 also being equal to  theta '. The values of the parameters N,  theta ', a and d are chosen so that a delay time variation  DELTA tR of the pulse through the line corresponds to a modulation band  DELTA f of the pulse in a quasilinear range. Application to compression/expansion for obtaining laser pulses of high power or of very short duration.

a first optical grating (Rl) and a second optical grating

diffracted at an angle ('), which is greater than the 
critical angle of refraction, by transmission through the 

first grating (R1) and then through the second grating

the angle of emergence from the second grating being
