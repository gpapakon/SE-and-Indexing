<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal transfer
recording sheet. More particularly, it relates to a
thermal transfer recording sheet which can be used
advantageously for color recording by OA terminals such as
printer, facsimile, copier, etc., and for color recording
of television images.Various systems such as electrophotography, ink
jetting and thermal transfer recording have been proposed
and studied for the color recording, and thermal transfer
recording is advantageous as compared with other systems in
many respects such as maintenance of the apparatus,
easiness of operation and inexpensiveness of expendables.In the thermal transfer recording system, an image
receiving material is placed on the ink-applied surface of
a thermal transfer recording sheet applied with an ink
containing colorants, and the backside of the said thermal
transfer recording sheet is heated by a thermal printing
head to transfer colorants to an image receiving material.
The thermal transfer recording methods can be classified
into two types, for instance, a thermofusion-type transfer
recording system using a heat-fusible ink and a
sublimation-type transfer recording system using an ink
containing sublimable dyes. In these types of thermal transfer recording system,
however, the thermal transfer recording sheet is heated to
a high temperature by the thermal head, so that if the base
film of the thermal transfer recording sheet is not
sufficiently high in heat resistance, the base film may be
fused to the thermal head to cause improper running of the
head relative to the thermal transfer recording sheet and
other undesirable phenomena such as sticking, wrinkling or
break of the thermal transfer recording sheet, making it
unable to perform proper recording. For the improvement of
heat resistance of the base film, it has been proposed to
provide a protective film composed of various kinds of
heat-resistant resin on the opposite surface of the base
film to the colorant layer (Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 55-7467 and 57-74195). Also, for
improving the running property of the sheet, it has been
proposed to incorporate heat-resistant fine particles,
lubricant, surfactant or the like substance in the
protective layer (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
(KOKAI) Nos. 55-144790, 56-155794 and 57-129789).Recently, however, new problems have arisen in
recording according to the said system. Because of
accelerating of recording speed, a higher energy than used
hitherto is given to the thermal head, resulting in
