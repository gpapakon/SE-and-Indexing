<ABSTRACT>
Lids, closures and/or cartons for distributing, marketing 
and heating small portions of prepared food are fabricated with a 

paperboard Structural substrate coated with a heat activated (or 
sealable) coating of water soluble acrylic emulsion that is applied 

by means of a press in conjunction with a printing operation or, 
alternatively, by a coating operation separate from the printing 

operation. Other critical coating characteristics are that it is 
heat sealable to itself, to polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate 

and directly to unprimed paperboard, with or without a clay 
coating. Add
itionally, the coating may be tack bonded at 250°F or 
greater and is mass stable below 400°F.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to paperboard packages or 
cartons suitable for distributing, marketing and heating Prepared 
food products. To meet complex purity and performance specifications, 
highly specialized packaging systems have been developed for 
distributing, marketing and heating food for service. Many of such 
packaging systems are based upon a structural substrate folded from 
Preprinted and die-cut bleached sulphate paperboard as described by 
U. S. Patent No. 4,249,978 to T. R. Baker, U. S. Patent No. 
3,788,876 to D. R. Baker et al and U. S. Patent No. 4,930,639 to 
W. R. Rigby. To protect the paper package or carton from moisture degradation 
due to direct contact with a food substance, the internal 
surfaces of such a carton are coated with a moisture barrier of one 
or more continuous films of thermoplastic resin. These films are 
usually applied to the paperboard web, prior to printing and 
cutting, as a hot, viscous, extruded curtain. Polyethylene (LDPE), 
polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are three 
of the more prevalent thermoplastic resins used for this purpose. Covers for paperboard based food cartons may take one of 
several forms including a top flap that is an integral continuation 
of the same paperboard sheet or "blank" from which the carton 
vessel is erected, such top flap being crease hinged to one 
sidewall of the carton. Another type of cover has been an 
independent paperboard sheet that is adhesively secured or plastic  
 
fuse bonded to a small perimeter flange folded from the upper edge 
of the carton vessel sidewalls. Cartons and carton covers of the foregoing description require 
two separate converting operations to produce the carton blank 
following manufacture of the paperboard: 1) extrusion of the 
thermoplastic barrier coating and, 2) printing of the sales 
graphics. Consolidating both of these operations to a single 
operation offers obvious economic advantages. Moreover, minimum 
coat weights for an extruded moisture barrier typically range from 
11 to 26 pounds per 3000 ft.² ream. Lighter coat weights usually 
result in an inconsistent polymer layer or a layer with little or 
no adhesive property. Finally, extruded polymer moisture barriers greatly complicate 
those recycling procedures necessary to recover the carton fiber 
constituency. It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide 
a food packaging carton which utilizes a specialized polymer (water 
based/acrylic emulsion) to serve the same functions as an

<CLAIMS>
A paperboard sheet for covering a food distribution vessel 
fill opening, said sheet having a first side including a 

calendered coasting of particulate minerals, and a second side 
supporting a continuous coating of a water based acrylic emulsion 

which is used for heat sealing and as a vapor barrier for said 
sheet to a filled food distribution vessel in a covering position 

over a corresponding vessel fill opening. 
The paperboard sheet as described by claim 1 wherein said 
water based acrylic emulsion is mass stable below 400°F and is 

tack bonded at about 250°F or greater. 
The paperboard sheet as described by claim 1 wherein said 
water based acrylic emulsion comprises a styrene-acrylic 

copolymer wherein no more than 5% of the total copolymer units 
are derived from acrylic acid. 
The paperboard sheet as described by claim 1 wherein said 
water based acrylic emulsion is applied to said second side with 

a coat weight of 6 to 9 pounds per 3000 ft.². 
The paperboard sheet as described by claim 1 wherein said 
second side is also coated with a calendered coat of particulate 

minerals which has a 1 to 4 pounds per 3000 ft.² coating of said 
water based acrylic emulsion applied thereover. 
A paperboard carton for food products having vessel means 
with a content fill opening and a closure means for covering said 

fill opening, a first surface area on said vessel means around 
said fill opening for contiguously facing a second surface area 

on said closure means when positioned over said fill opening; 
and, a water-based acrylic emulsion coating on at least one of 

said surface areas for heat sealing said first and second surface 
areas together. 
A paperboard carton as described by claim 6 wherein said 
water based acrylic emulsion is mass stable below 400°F and is 

tack bonded at about 250°F or greater. 
A paperboard carton as described by claim 6 wherein said 
water based acrylic emulsion comprised a Styrene-acrylic 

copolymer wherein no more than 5% of the total polymer units are 
derived from acrylic acid. 
A paperboard carton as described by claim 6 wherein said 
closure means is formed from a paperboard sheet having a 

calendered coating of particulate minerals on one side thereof 
and a 6 to 9 pounds per 3000 ft.² coating of said water based 

acrylic emulsion on the other side thereof. 
A paperboard carton as described by claim 6 wherein said 
closure means is formed from a paperboard sheet having a 

calendered coating of particulate minerals on both sides thereof 
and a 1 to 4 pounds per 3000 ft.² coating of said water based 

acrylic emulsion over one of said mineral coatings.
