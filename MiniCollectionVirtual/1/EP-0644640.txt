<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation duct (trunking, conduit) for laying electrical cables (leads, lines). This installation duct has a base and two side walls which are integrally connected to it, as well as at least one partition wall which is arranged in the duct longitudinal direction. The partition wall can be locked to the base of the installation duct. The installation duct itself can be closed by a closure cover. The invention is seen in the fact that flat projections (311), which are directed towards the interior of the duct, are stamped at a defined distance from one another into the base (31) of the installation duct (3). Elongated holes, which are aligned to the duct axis, are incorporated into these flat projections (311). The partition wall (1) is of L-shaped design, having a relatively short L-limb (12) which is directed towards the base of the installation duct (3). Fastening lugs (121, 122, 123, 124), which are stamped through and are integrally connected to the L-limb (12) only on a narrow side (1211), are formed out in this L-limb (12). These fastening lugs (121, 122, 123, 124) can be inserted into the elongated holes on the base of the installation duct (3), and the partition wall (1) can be locked by displacement under the flat projections (311).

Trunking, for the installation of electrical cables, with a base and two side 
walls attached to the latter in one piece as well as with at least one partition 

wall arranged along the trunking that can be located in position at the base 
of the trunking, as well as with a cover, characterised by the fact that 

embossed in the base (31) of the trunking (3) are flat elevations (311) which 
face the trunking interior, are spaced apart at a defined distance and 

feature slots aligned with the trunking axis, and that the partition wall (1) is 
L-shaped with a shorter L-member (12) facing the base of the trunking (3) in 

which are stamped fixing lugs (121, 122, 123, 124) attached in one piece to 
the L-member (12) by only a narrow side (1211), it being possible to insert 

these lugs into the slots at the base of the trunking (3) and locate the 

partition wall in position by sliding the lugs beneath the flat elevations (311). 
Trunking as described in daim 1, characterised by the fact that the dear 
engagement height of the flat elevations (311) at the base (31) of the 

trunking (3) at least corresponds to the material thickness of the fixing lugs 
(121, 122, 123, 124). 
Trunking as described in daim 1, characterised by the fact that the fixing 
lugs (121, 122, 123, 124) project through at least as far as the wall 

thickness of the flat elevations (311) in the L-member (12).
