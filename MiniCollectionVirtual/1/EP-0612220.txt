<DESCRIPTION>
In several Asian nations, decapod crustacea 
(particularly shrimp) have been raised in aquaculture 
environments for over 2,000 years. Motivation to 
improve on the antiquated aquaculture technology was 
provided as a result of a surge in shrimp market 
demand in the mid-1970s. Taiwan was at the leading 
edge of the innovation and by 1987 emerged as the 
world's leading shrimp exporter, surpassing even the 
fishing nations of Mexico and India. The egg production of crustaceans (e.g., the 
white shrimp Penaeusvannamei) in aquaculture is 
currently stimulated by unilateral eye stalk ablation. 
This enhances egg production and egg laying in some 
species, whereas others respond inconsistently. In 
addition to the eyestalk ablation, other factors such 
as diet, light, temperature and water conditions are 
carefully controlled to optimize production. The effects of eyestalk ablation vary with the 
season of the year and the stage in the molt cycle. 
Shrimp which are ablated as they prepare to enter 
their reproductive peak are more conditioned to yield 
a reproductive (as opposed to a molting) response than 
those entering a reproductively dormant period. The fecundity and viability of spawns from 
ablated females have been reported to be inferior to 
spawns from females matured in the wild. Furthermore, 
in comparison to normal mature ovaries, the ovaries 
from ablated females have been found to be smaller,  
 
with a higher lipid composition, and more variable in 
distribution of yolk among oocytes. These differences 
presumably are consequences of hormonal insensitivity 
of ablated shrimp to physiological or environmental 
conditions such as oocyte differentiation, nutrient 
storage, food supply or temperature. An alternative method for increasing the larval 
production of female crustacea would be of great value 
to the industry. The subject invention relates to compositions and 
methods for increasing the production of viable larvae 
by female crustaceans. An effective amount of a 
juvenile hormone (e.g. methyl farnesoate) is 
administered to the female crustacean as a supplement 
to the conventional aquaculture diet which includes 
annelid worms. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a method for increasing 
the production of viable larvae of female crustaceans, 
preferably decapods such as shrimps, in aquaculture 
raised on an annelid worm-containing diet, comprising 
supplementing said diet with an effective amount of a 
compound having juvenile hormone activity.

A method for increasing the production of viable 
larvae by female crustaceans, preferably decapods such as shrimps, in aquaculture raised 

on an annelid worm-containing diet, comprising 
supplementing said diet with an effective amount 

of a compound having juvenile hormone activity. 
A method of Claim 1, wherein the compound is 
selected from the group consisting of methyl 

farnesoate; farnesoic acid; juvenile hormone I; 
juvenile hormone II; juvenile hormone III; 8,11,14 

Eicosatrienoic acid; methoprene; hydroprene; 
fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen. 
A method of Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the compound is either 

administered orally, 
topically, or 

by injection.  
 
A crustacean food comprising a fish meal blend 
containing a compound having juvenile hormone 

activity at a concentration in the range of 
0.00026% to 0.0011% by weight. 
A crustacean food of Claim 4 wherein the compound 
is selected from the group consisting of methyl 

farnesoate; farnesoic acid; juvenile hormone I; 
juvenile hormone II; juvenile hormone III; 

8,11,14 Eicosatrienoic acid; methoprene; 
hydroprene; fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen. 
An extruded crustacean food comprising a fish 
meal blend containing methyl farnesoate at a 

concentration substantially .00055% by weight. 
In a method for raising shrimp in aquaculture 
which includes an annelid worm-containing diet, 

the improvement comprising dispensing to the 
shrimp, once daily, a crustacean food comprising 

a fish meal blend containing a compound having 
juvenile hormone activity at a concentration in 

the range of 0.00026% to 0.0011% by weight. 
A method of Claim 7 wherein the compound is 
selected from the group consisting of methyl 

farnesoate; farnesoic acid; juvenile hormone I; 
juvenile hormone II; juvenile hormone III; 

8,11,14 Eicosatrienoic acid; methoprene; 
hydroprene; fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen, preferably 

methyl farnesoate  
 
A method for increasing the rate of fertility and 
hatchability of eggs produced by female crustacea 

in aquaculture comprising reducing the quantity 
of, or eliminating, annelid worms from the 

conventional aquaculture diet and substituting 
therefor an effective amount of juvenile hormones 

in an edible carrier, such as an extruded fish 
meal blend. 
A method of Claim 9, wherein the compound is 
selected from the group consisting of methyl 

farnesoate; farnesoic acid; juvenile hormone I; 
juvenile hormone II; juvenile hormone III; 

8,11,14 Eicosatrienoic acid; methoprene; 
hydroprene; fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen.
