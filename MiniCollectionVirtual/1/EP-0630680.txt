<ABSTRACT>
A method for removing nitrogen oxides from an 
oxygen-rich exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides and 

hydrocarbons comprising bringing the oxygen-rich exhaust 
gas into contact with a catalyst comprising (1)(i) a 

zeolite containing an apatite compound and having an 
SiO₂/Al₂O₃ molar ratio of at least 15 and (ii) at least 

one active metal or (2)(ii) a zeolite containing an 
apatite compound and having an SiO₂/Al₂O₃ molar ratio of 

at least 15, (ii) an alkaline earth metal and (iii) at 
least one active metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
catalytically treating an oxygen-rich exhaust gas 
containing nitrogen oxides discharged from, for example, 
boilers, automobile engines. More specifically, it 
relates to a method for removing nitrogen oxides from the 
oxygen-rich exhaust gas in the presence of a catalyst 
having a superior activity and durability. The term 
"oxygen rich exhaust gas" used herein means an exhaust 
gas containing oxygen in an amount exceeding the amount 
of oxygen necessary for completely oxidising carbon 
monoxide, hydrocarbons and hydrogen contained in the 
exhaust gas. As methods for removing nitrogen oxides from 
exhaust gas containing the same, discharged from for 
example, boilers, automobile engines, methods of 
selective catalytic reduction with ammonia in the 
presence of a catalyst and methods of non-selective 
catalytic reduction by allowing the exhaust gas to be 
passed through a catalyst whereby nitrogen oxides are 
reduced by unburnt carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons have 
been commercialized. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 60-125250 proposes copper-ion exchanged zeolite, as a 
catalyst capable of directly decomposing the nitrogen 
oxides without using a reducing agent. Further, there has been proposed as a catalyst 
for purifying the exhaust gas discharged from a diesel 
engine or a lean burn engine designed for low fuel 
consumption and capable of selectively reducing nitrogen 
oxides with the reductants such as unburnt carbon 
monoxide, hydrocarbons, even in an oxygen-rich state, a  
 
catalyst comprising zeolite containing a base metal 
(e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 
63-100919). However, the above-proposed catalysts have 
problems with durability, particularly at a high 
temperature, and therefore, those catalysts have not been 
commercialized. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is 
to provide a method for purifying an exhaust gas, without 
using reducing agents such as ammonia, in the presence of 
an exhaust gas purifying catalyst capable of efficiently 
purifying, especially oxygen-rich exhaust gas discharged 
from an internal combustion engine of, for example, an 
automobile and having a superior durability at high 
temperature in the presence of steam. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will be apparent from the following 
description. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a method for removing nitrogen oxides from an 
oxygen-rich exhaust gas
