<ABSTRACT>
A universal interface for operatively connecting and feeding the sequential copy 
sheet output of various reproduction machines (12) of widely varying ranges of sheet output 

level heights to various independent copy sheet processing units (1) having widely varying 
sheet input level heights with a free-standing movable interface module (10) of a fixed narrow 

width. A sheet feeding path (14) extends from one side of the module to the other for 
transporting the copy sheets. This sheet feeding path is preferably bi-directional and reversible 

for feeding copy sheets therethrough from either side. It is repositionable by vertically 
repositioning over a large vertical height range, integral sheet path ends (15,16) opening at 

opposite sides of the interface module. A retention system (17,19) retains the sheet path ends 
at a selected height position mating with a selected reproduction apparatus sheet output level 

and a selected copy sheet processing unit sheet input level. The disclosed sheet feeding path 
varies in length automatically with this path end repositioning, yet remains substantially linear, 

and to that end may utilize baffles (20) which telescope automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interface for enabling the copy sheet output of a 
range of reproduction machines to be fed to a range of copy sheet processing units. By way of background, there are a large number of copiers and printers on the 
market and on the drawing board today that are at different paper path heights and directions 
for input and output. Customers are desirous of greater compatibility with various commercial 
feeding/finishing equipment providing more on-line sheet processing options, with less 
manual sheet handling In the past, some copier designs called for the output sheets to be 
delivered at a "standard" output height and side for that particular supplier, but often without 
regard to potential downstream equipment, leaving the task of delivering that sheet output to 
that other downstream device as the responsibility of that particular paper handling accessory 
equipment supplier [of which there are more than 24 multi-nationally]. Also, the sheet feeding 
rates (in copies per minute, or cm. per second) are often not compatible. The number of 
possible combinations is staggering. Although a "standard" paper path height agreement at 
860mm (measured from the floor) with some finishing suppliers has been proposed, even if 
accepted, that could undesirably force compromise of other copier, printer or finisher design 
features. There is extensive and longstanding patent prior art on various specialized partially 
variable level copier-to-sorter or internal sorter variable bin level sheet transports, and some 
patent art on interface modules (examples are cited below). Of particular background interest on the general subject of interface modules is U.S. 
patent No. 5,172,162. Col. 2, lines 29-44 of this 5,172,162 patent incidentally acknowledges the 
problem of printer/accessory unit height incompatability addressed herein. However, that 
patent does not provide any actual teaching of any solution to that problem. [This patent 
primarily addresses possible internal sheet handling features within such an interface module, 
such as a purging system.] The following additional U.S. patents are also noted as disclosing interface modules 
with sheet transports: 4,602,775 on a modular unit providing for cover insertion and sheet 
inversion taking input on one side from a copier and providing output on the other side to a 
finisher (but at the same level); 5,145,168 (Fig. 1, interface module 80); 5,137,270; 4,602,776 
(inserter module 45); 4,830,356 (module 70 in Fig. 7); 4,353,543;

<CLAIMS>
A universal interface for operatively connecting and feeding the sequential copy 
sheet output of various selectable reproduction apparatus (12) of widely varying ranges of sheet 

output level heights and direction to various selectable independent copy sheet processing 
modules (11) having widely varying sheet input level heights, comprising: 


a free-standing movable universal interface module (10) of a fixed width; 
said free-standing universal interface module (10) providing a repositionable sheet 
feeding path (14) therethrough, from one side to the other of said module (10), for transporting said 

copy sheet output of said selected reproduction apparatus (12) to said sheet input of said selected 
copy sheet processing module (11); 
said repositionable sheet feeding path (14) through said universal interface module (10) 
including integral vertically repositionable sheet receiving or sheet discharging sheet path ends (15,16) 

opening at opposite sides of said interface module (10), which sheet path ends (15,16) are readily 
independently repositionable over a large vertical height range; and 
a retention system (17,18,19) for retaining said sheet path ends (15,16) at selected height positions 
mating with a selected reproduction apparatus sheet output level and a selected copy sheet 

processing module sheet input level so that said repositionable sheet feeding path is operatively 
connecting therebetween to feed sheets from said reproduction apparatus (12) to said copy sheet 

processing module (11). 
A universal interface as claimed in claim 1, wherein said repositionable sheet feeding 
path (14) through said universal interface module (10) provides selectably reversible feeding of said 

copy sheets therethrough in either direction. 
A universal interface as claimed in claim 2, wherein said sheet feeding path (14) has an 
automatically reversing sheet feed drive 
A universal interface as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said 
repositionable sheet feeding path (14) has a variable path length which is varied automatically with 

the vertical repositioning of the path ends (15,16). 
A universal interface as claimed in claim 4, wherein said sheet feeding path (14) is defined 
by telescoping baffles (20) automatically telescoping to provide changes in said sheet feeding path 

length.  
 
A universal interface as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said sheet 
feeding path (14) through said interface module (10) remains substantially linear irrespective of the 

vertical repositioning of the path ends (15, 16). 
A universal interface as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said universal 
interface module (10) has a constant width of less than about 40 cm. 
A universal interface as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein at least one of 
said sheet path ends (15, 16) of said interface module sheet feeding path (14) is vertically repositionable 

over a vertical height range of at least approximately 50 to 100 cm. 
A universal interface as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein said 
repositionable sheet feeding path (15, 16) comprises a variable speed sheet feed drive (100, M, 13) automatically 

adjusting to sheet input speed.
