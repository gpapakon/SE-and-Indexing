<CLAIMS>
A thermoplastic molding material essentially comprising from
1 to 50% by weight of a particulate polymer A having a mean

particle size of less than 1000 nm and consisting of

a1:
up to 99.8% by weight of at least one vinylaromatic monomer
al,
a2:
up to 99.8% by weight of at least one alkyl methacrylate
a2 where the alkyl radical is of 1 to 8 carbon atoms,
a3:
up to 50% by weight of at least one polar, copolymerizable,
ethylenically unsaturated monomer a3,
a4:
from 0.1 to 10% by weight of at least one polyfunctional,
crosslinking monomer a4 and
a5:
from 0.1 to 15% by weight of at least one monomer a5 containing
one or more acidic, basic or epoxy groups,

the sum of the components a1, a2 and a3 being from 75 to
99.8% by weight, based on A, and the sum of a1, a2, a3, a4

and a5 being 100% by weight, based on A, and from 50 to 99%
by weight of at least one thermoplastic having a glass

transition temperature of more than 25Â°C, selected from
polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene and

copolymers of a vinylaromatic monomer and a polar,
copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, the

difference between the refractive index of the polymer A and
that of the thermoplastic being less than 0.2 and, if

required, minor amounts of conventional additives and
assistants. 
A thermoplastic molding material as claimed in claim 1, in
which the polymer A is prepared by emulsion polymerization.
A thermoplastic molding material as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
in which the thermoplastic is a copolymer of a vinylaromatic

monomer and a polar, copolymerizable, ethylenically
unsaturated monomer, a styrene/acrylonitrile copolymer and/or

an a-methylstyrene/acrylonitrile copolymer.
A thermoplastic molding material as claimed in any of
claims 1 to 3, in which the difference between the refractive

index of the polymer A and that of the thermoplastic is less
than 0.02.
