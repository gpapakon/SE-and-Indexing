<DESCRIPTION>
Our invention relates to the use of alkyl cyclopentanone, 
cycloalkanol and phenyl alkanol derivative-containing 
compositions having the structures: 
 
   or 
the mixture of compounds having the structures:  
 
 
taken alone, or in admixture for repelling blood feeding 
arthropods, including species of mosquitoes and house flies as 
well as apparatus for determining repellency and attractancy of 
semiochemicals such as the aforementioned cycloalkanol 
derivative-containing compositions against and for such blood 
feeding arthropods. Subject matter according to the present invention is a method of repelling insect species 
according to Claim 1. Preferred embodiments thereof are subject matter of Claims 2 and 4.  
 Further subject matter is a process for repelling blood feeding arthropods from a person 
according to Claim 3. Still a further subject matter is an insect repelling device according to Claim 5. A preferred embodiment thereof is subject matter of Claim 6. The method according to the present invention can e.g. be used in a semiochemical field 
trap for blood feeding arthropods which has the capability of 
causing determination of repellency and attractancy of 
semiochemicals against and for blood feeding arthropods. The 
field trap comprises: 
(1) an upright vertically disposed hollow housing means: 
having arthropod-impenetrable vertical side wall means 
defining a vertically disposed inner void, (for 
example, a cylindrical rigid plastic housing produced 
from a phenol-formaldehyde polymer); having an upper 
terminal end means provided with gas entry means; 
having and piercing said side wall means, at least two 
horizontally-disposed separate sets of apertures, 
including an aperture set S1 and an aperture set 
S2; with aperture set S1 being vertically distant 
from and substantially adjacent to aperture S2; 
with the apertures of aperture sets S1 and S2 
being gas transmission apertures containing gas 
transmission means (e.g., a polyethylene tube) or 
having first radiation means sealably inserted 
therethrough (for example, a light emitting diode or a 
laser diode); (2) horizontally disposed hollow housing means (for 
example, horizontally disposed open ended hollow 
cylinders fabricated from aluminum or rigid plastic 
such as acrylic plastic) having substantially 
horizontally disposed arthopod impenetrable side walls 
defining horizontally disposed inner void means; 
having oppositely juxtaposed inner and outer open 
terminal end means; the inner terminal end means being 
circumferential
