<ABSTRACT>
An electrodeposited composite coating comprises, as deposited, a matrix of cobalt and particles of chromium carbide, at least 50 % and preferably at least 80 % or 90 % by weight of the particles lying within the size range of 4 (my)m to 8 (my)m.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrodeposited composite
coatings, i.e. coatings which consist of an
electrolytically or electrolessly plated metal matrix
with included particles which are codeposited with the
matrix. The particles are suspended in the electrolyte
containing the metal ions for the matrix and are
substantially insoluble in the electrolyte and, during
the plating operation, become included in the plated
matrix.The coatings may be applied to a variety of
components subjected to wear such as aero-engine
components, particularly those likely to operate at
elevated temperatures, bearing surfaces, rocket nozzles,
and tubes and nozzles carrying abrasive substances. The
coatings may be applied to the whole component but more
frequently they will be applied to only a portion of its
surface. The electrodeposition technique is particularly
suitable to the protection of selected areas and the
coating of complex, re-entrant and inaccessible areas do
not present any great problems. The coatings are
particularly suited to use on gas turbine blades.Our United Kingdom patent GB-A-1358538 describes a
composite coating comprising, as deposited, a matrix
which is at least 50% by weight cobalt and particles
included in the matrix which are at least 50% by weight
chromium carbide, at least 50% by weight of the particles
having a particle size of less than ten µm and
preferably between 2 and 5 µm.The specification of GB-A-1358538 indicates that
although preferably all the particles have a size between
2 and 5 µm it may not be practicable completely to 
avoid a small quantity of fines below 2 µm and
possibly some larger particles due, for example, to
agglomeration but states that preferably more than 80% by
weight of the particles lie within the specified limits,
i.e. between 2 and 5 µm.The processes described in GB-A-1358538 have been
used for approximately twenty years with very great
success. The particles which have been used have had a
size distribution within the range set out, i.e. most of
the particles having a size between 2 and 5 µm. The
particles used have been much as received from the
supplier but, as will be explained below, some small
adjustment has sometimes been made by removing a
proportion of the larger particles. It has been found
that coatings are produced having an as-deposited
composition range of between 13 and 20 percent by weight
of chromium carbide dispersed in a cobalt matrix. The
as-deposited coatings are somewhat modified by diffusion
produced by heat treatment and/or heat resulting

<CLAIMS>
An electrodeposited composite coating comprising, as deposited, a
matrix which is at least 50% by weight cobalt and particles included in the

matrix which are at least 50% by weight chromium carbide, characterised by
at least 80% by weight of the particles falling within the size range of 4 to 12

µm.
A coating according to claim 1 in which 90% by weight of the
particles fall within the size range of 4 to 12 µm.
A coating according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which at least 80% by
weight of the particles fall within the size range of 4 to 8 µm.
A coating according to claim 1 or claim 2 or claim 3 in which
substantially all of the particles are chromium carbide.
A carbide coating according to any of claims 1 to 4 in which the
matrix is substantially all cobalt.
A coating as claimed in any preceding claim in which substantially
none of the particles has a size greater than 20 µm.
A coating as claimed in any preceding claim in which the proportion
of the particles therein is 35 weight percent. 
A method of producing a coating which comprises depositing by
electrodeposition or by electroless deposition a matrix of cobalt and

codepositing with the matrix particles of chromium carbide suspended in the
plating bath, 80% by weight of the particles falling within the size range of 4

to 12 µm.
A method according to claim 8 in which the deposited coating is heat
treated to produce diffusion of material between the matrix and the particles.
A method according to claim 8 or claim 9 in which the plating bath
comprises a vessel (1), and the depositing of the cobalt matrix and the particles

comprises a weir process in that the deposited coating is produced on a
workpiece mounted on a rotating jig (16) in a working zone (9) of the plating

vessel (1), the vessel having a partition (6) having a top edge (14) forming a
broad crested weir over which plating solution and the particles flow, the

particles thereafter travelling downwardly and settling on the workpiece.
