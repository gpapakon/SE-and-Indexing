<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing thin-film products consisting of 
injecting the molten resin into a die. The internal cavity 

pressure is momentarily reduced when the internal cavity pressure 
reaches a prescribed pressure, and closing of the cavity is 

performed so that the final thickness of the molded product is 
achieved, and a thin-film molded product produced is produced by 

said method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing thin films of synthetic resin, for example, a
molded product with a film thickness of less than
approximately 1 mm.Synthetic resins, especially, various types of
molded products consisting of materials comprised of
engineering plastics, also referred to as high
performance plastics, are widely used for many purposes.
For example, they are widely used for housings and
chassis for small portable machines of notebook or lap-top
style. A weight that is as light as possible is
required for housings for said types of small machines.The easiest method to achieve weight reduction in
molded resin products is to reduce the thickness of the
film. However, in order to produce a thin-film molded
product with a thickness of less than 1 mm, for example,
it is necessary to perform the injection at a high
pressure so that the molten resin injected from the
injection cylinder flows within a narrow cavity at a high
speed. When the molten material is injected from the
nozzle at a high injection pressure, the pressure of the
molten material in the cavity is drastically increased,
and as a result the die members tend to part. When this
happens, it is difficult to produce a molded product with
the desired thin-film thickness and design. It is not practical to provide a closing force
greater than a predetermined value to eliminate the
above-mentioned problems from the standpoint of
mechanical structure and cost factors. Therefore,
application of compression injection molding, in which
the gap of the die cavity is set at a value greater than
the prescribed thickness, and closing is done while the
molten material is being injected to restore the
prescribed cavity gap, is conceivable.As an example, the compression injection molding
method disclosed in Japanese Kakai Patent Application No.
SHO 60[1985]-110419 (applicant, Idemitsu Petrochemicals,
Ltd.), etc. can be mentioned. However, in a high
performance molding that achieves adequate physical
properties even when the thickness of the film is low,
that is, upon molding of engineering plastics, closing is
inhibited due to the internal cavity pressure generated
at the final filling stage, especially at the time of
production of a thin-film molded product with a film
thickness less than 1 mm, and a greater closing force is
required; as a result, it is difficult to produce a film
with the prescribed thickness.BE-A-559392 describes a process for manufacturing
moulded articles in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.
Patent
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a thin film of plastics
material having a desired thickness, comprising the steps

of injecting molten resin into a cavity formed between a
stationary die and a movable die with the movable die

positioned so that the cavity is opened wider than the
desired thickness of the thin film; and closing the dies

by relative movement of the dies towards each other so
that the cavity reaches the desired thickness;

   characterized by
starting the die closing operation while injection is proceding,

monitoring the pressure
within the cavity by means of a pressure sensor as the

injection step proceeds, and discontinuing injection of
resin when a predetermined pressure has been

reached to allow backflow of the molten resin from the
cavity during the closing step.
The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined pressure is
between 200 and 300 kg/cm
2
.
The method of claim 1, wherein the desired
thickness of the film is less than 1mm.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the pressure
sensor is installed at 70-80% of the flow distance of the

molded product.
