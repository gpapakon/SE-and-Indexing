<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for manufacturing a coaxial cable in the case of which a dielectric layer is extruded onto an inner conductor which is fed continuously, a longitudinally running metal strip is formed around this insulated conductor produced in this way, to form a slotted tube, and is welded on its longitudinal edges, and the welded tube is pulled down onto the surface of the dielectric layer. In this case, a metal strip is used which is provided with a plastic coating on at least one of its surfaces, and the welding of the longitudinal edges is carried out by laser welding.

Method of producing a coaxial cable in which a 
dielectric layer (2) is extruded onto a continuously fed 

inner conductor (1), a longitudinally entering metal 
strip (3a) is shaped into a slotted tube (3) around said 

insulated conductor formed in this way and is welded at 
its longitudinal edges, and the welded tube is drawn down 

onto the surface of the dielectric layer, characterized 
in that a metal strip is used which is provided at least 

on one of its surfaces with a plastic layer (3b) and the 
longitudinal edges are welded by laser welding. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a focused laser beam is used, the actual welding 

point lying underneath the focus. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, after the welded tube is drawn down, a plastic 

sheath (5) is extruded onto it. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that an aluminium strip having a single-sided 

copolymer coating is formed around the dielectric layer 
in such a way that the copolymer coating faces the 

dielectric layer. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that an aluminium strip having a wall thickness 

of 0.15 to 0.25 mm and a layer thickness of the 
copolymer of 0.02 to 0.06 mm is used. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that vapours produced during the welding 

process are extracted. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that a strip (9) of a copolymer is introduced  

 
into the still-open slotted tube in such a way that it is 

situated underneath the welding seam.
