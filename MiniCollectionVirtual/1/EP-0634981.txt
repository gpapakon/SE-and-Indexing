A device for covering and uncovering a two- or three-dimensional
space (2), the device comprising a cover (1) mounted on at least one

head beam (4), and means for moving the cover in a covering direction

(f
1
) and in a contrary, uncovering direction (f
2
) between a magazine
(7) for receiving the cover in the uncovered position and a position

in which the space is covered, the device being characterized in that
the displacement means are constituted by at least one piece of

equipment (A, B) comprising:

a chain (11) that is rigid, at least in thrust, controlled to
move in translation and including one end connected to the head beam

(4);
a series of means (30) for providing temporary coupling
between the chain and the cover, and designed to be distributed along

the cover in the covering position; and
a system (42, 65) acting on the temporary coupling means (30)
and suitable for disconnecting the cover from the chain in the

magazine, and at least in the uncovering direction, said means
enabling the cover to be stored sequentially in the magazine

independently of the chain being stored, and enabling the equipment
to be retracted completely from the space (2) that is to be covered.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the coupling
means (30) comprise means (32, 51-53, 61-62) providing relative

coupling between the cover (1) and the chain (11) in at least one
direction normal to the displacement direction of the chain, and

means (38, 51-53, 63) providing temporary coupling at least in the
uncovering direction (f
2
) to enable the chain to entrain the cover to
the magazine.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the temporary
coupling means (38, 53, 63) and the coupling means (32, 53, 61-62)

normal to the chain are provided, at least in part, on carriages or
supports (31) secured to the cover.
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that each carriage
(31) is carried by a cross-member (5) secured to the cover (1). 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the coupling
means (32) normal to the chain are constituted by fastening means

formed by a hook (36) carried by the carriage and designed to engage
partially around a roller (20) of the chain, with a stop (39) and a

counter-stop (41) being disposed on either side of the hook and being
suitable for coming into abutment against the rollers (20) of the

chain.
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the
temporary coupling means are constituted by at least one finger (38,

63) adapted to insert itself between the rollers (20) of the chain.
A device according to aim 6, characterized in that the finger (63)
possesses capacity for elastic deformation enabling it to retract

from the roller (20) of the chain when the force to which it is
subjected exceeds a predetermined threshold.
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the
coupling means normal to the displacement of the chain are

constituted by complementary portions (51-53, 61-62) formed on the
chain and on the cover.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the chain
(11) is moved in translation by a sprocket (19) placed at the

magazine (7) and a guide slideway (47) for the temporary coupling
means (30) is disposed in a distance relationship relative to the

sprocket to enable the temporary coupling means to be guided during
operations of being connected to and disconnected from the chain.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the system
(42) for disconcerting the cover from the chain (11) also ensures

that the temporary coupling means (30) are taken to the entrance of
the magazine (7).
A device according to claim 10, characterized in that the system
(42) for disconnecting the cover from the chain is constituted by a 

rail extending inside the magazine in the vicinity of the sprocket
and on the displacement axis of the chain to be interposed between

the carriages (31) and the chain (11).
A device according to claims 1 and 7, characterized in that the
system for disconnecting the cover from the chain (11) is constituted

by a stop (65) that is interposed on the displacement path of the
cover in the uncovering direction (f
2
), to co-operate with the chain
to apply a force on the elastic finger (63) of predetermined value

enabling the finger to be retracted.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that it includes
two pieces of equipment (A, B) whose chains (11) extend in parallel

and spaced-apart from each other, so as to support the cover (1).
