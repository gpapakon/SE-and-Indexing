<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum device for cutting hair consisting of a 
vacuum apparatus with a hose (3) and a nozzle (4) to which is 

connected a tubular element (13,14) whose other end is closed and 
which is provided on its external surface with at least 

one row of pins (18) or bristles (20) and a series of holes (19,21) close 
to said pins (18) or bristles (20), the vacuum apparatus being provided 

with a vertical pole (6) provided with arms (7,8), a basket (9)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum device for 
cutting hair, by means of which the hair particles can be 
vacuumed during the hair cutting process, thereby maintaining 
perfect conditions of cleanness both during and 
at the end of said cutting process. The device of the invention can be applied especially 
in men's and women's hairdressers, although it can 
also be used in animal hairdressers. By means of the vacuum device of the invention, 
constant cleanness can be maintained during and at the 
end of the hair cutting process, it being possible to 
vacuum the hairs deposited either on the customer or on 
the clothes of the hairdresser at all times. The vacuum device of the invention comprises a 
vacuum apparatus from which leads a flexible hose at the  
 
free end of which a nozzle is connected. According to the present invention, said nozzle 
consists of a tubular element which is closed at one of 
its ends and open at the other, by which it is connected 
to the hose of the vacuum apparatus. This tubular element 
is provided externally on its wall with one or more rows 
of pins or bristles, constituting a comb or brush, and is 
provided with holes, adjacent to said pins or bristles, 
through which the vacuuming effect is produced. Preferably, the vacuum apparatus is of the portable 
variety, provided with a housing to which is fixed a 
vertical tubular pole on which are arranged a number of 
upwardly orientated intermediate arms, defining pegs for 
hanging the vacuum hose and the cable for connecting the 
vacuum apparatus. Also arranged on the pole, above said 
arms, is a basket designed to contain the tools and 
accessories which may be necessary for the hair cutting 
operation. Finally, an electrical switch is arranged at 
the top of the pole for switching on and off the vacuum 
motor to which it is connected vis said pole. If there are two or more hairdressing positions, 
there may be provided a single vacuum apparatus with 
hoses leading to the hairdressing positions for connecting 
the flexible hose to which the comb or brush which 
constitutes the vacuum nozzle is connected. The pole of the apparatus described may be 
telescopic or alternatively be fixed to the housing of 
the vacuum apparatus by means of pressure-screws or 
elements which enable its height to be adjusted. With the constitution described, the comb or brush 
which is used at all times during the hair cutting 
process is connected to the hose of the vacuum device, 
thereby enabling the hairs to be vacuumed both as they 
ar
