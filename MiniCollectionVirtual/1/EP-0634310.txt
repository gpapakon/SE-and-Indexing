<ABSTRACT>
The steering column (2) has a circumferential bracket (7) on which there is supported a spiral spring (8). The spiral spring end (8) which is at some distance from the bracket (7) acts on a recess body (9) which has a row of recesses (10) which are parallel to one another. The recesses (10) are formed from mutually parallel open grooves which are evenly distributed around the outside surface of the essentially annular recess body. The recess body can be displaced on the steering column (2) in the longitudinal direction of the latter and is mounted so as to be rotatable with respect to the steering column (2). An essential feature of the invention is also a symmetrical toothing (11) which is arranged on the upper end face and engages under the force of the spiral spring (8) in a matching toothing (12) which is fixed with respect to the steering column (2). The toothing (12) is mounted on a tooth lining (13) which is slid onto the steering column (2) and is non-releasably connected to the latter, for example by means of shrinking, welding or the like.
