<ABSTRACT>
An optical information recording and/or 
reproducing apparatus includes a stationary portion and 

a movable portion. The stationary portion has an 
irradiation optical system for emitting a beam for 

recording information in an optical information 
recording medium and/or reproducing recorded 

information, and a detection-optical system for 
detecting a beam from the recording medium. The 

movable portion is movable relative to the stationary 
portion and has an objective lens. The movable portion 

has a first optical path for irradiating the beam from 
the irradiation optical system onto the recording 

medium and a second optical path for guiding the beam 
from the recording medium to the detection optical 

system. The first optical path and the second optical 
path are formed as partly different paths. A beam 

separator for separating the beam from the irradiation 
optical system into a plurality of beams is set in the 

specific path only for the first optical system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording and/or reproducing apparatus for
recording information in an optical information
recording medium, reproducing the information recorded
in the recording medium, and/or erasing the information
recorded in the recording medium. More particularly,
the present invention relates to an optical information
recording and/or reproducing apparatus with an optical
system of optical head being separated into a
stationary portion and a movable portion.There are conventionally known various types of
information recording media for recording or
reproducing information with light, for example a disc
type, a card type, a tape type, etc. These optical
information recording media include those for recording
and reproduction and those only for reproduction.
Information is recorded in a recordable medium while
scanning an information track with an optical beam as
modulated according to recorded information and as
focused in a fine spot. Thus, the information is
recorded as information bit strings which can be 
optically detected.Also, information is reproduced from a
recording medium by scanning information bit strings in
an information track with an optical beam spot of a
constant power low enough to avoid recording in the
medium and then detecting reflected light or
transmitted light from the medium.An optical head used in recording the
information in the above-described recording medium or
in reproducing the information therefrom is arranged as
relatively movable relative to the recording medium in
the information track direction and in the transverse
direction across the information track direction, and
movement of the optical head effects the scanning of
information track with the optical beam spot. For
example, an objective lens is used as a focusing lens
for the optical beam spot in the optical head. The
objective lens is held in the optical head body such
that it can move independently in the direction of the
optical axis thereof (in the focusing direction) and in
the direction perpendicular to both the optical axis
direction and the information track direction of
recording medium (in the tracking direction). Such
holding of the objective lens is generally effected
through an elastic member, and the movement of
objective lens in the above two directions is generally
achieved by actuators utilizing the magnetic 
interaction.Meanwhile, a great future demand for the
optical information recording medium of card
(hereinafter referred to as an optical card)
