<ABSTRACT>
A laser beam generator for converging a laser beam 
(L) onto a surface of a workpiece (W), such as the inner 

surface of a cylindrical hole (H) or the outer surface 
of a cylindrical rod, to treat the surface has a 

cylindrical beam shaping mirror (1) disposed in a path 
of a laser beam (L). The cylindrical beam shaping 

mirror (1) has a plurality of successive conical taper 
surfaces (C) on an inner surface thereof for reflecting 

the laser beam into a plurality of ring-shaped laser 
beams and converging the ring-shaped laser beams into a 

cylindrical laser beam onto the surface (H) of the 
workpiece. The cylindrical beam shaping mirror is 

water-cooled by a water jacket (2) disposed therearound. 
The cylindrical laser beam has a uniform energy 

distribution which is effective to modify the surface of 
the workpiece, e.g. to quench the surface, 
for high 
resistance against fatigue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical system 
for use in a laser beam generator for applying a laser 
beam to a workpiece to heat-treat an inner cylindrical 
surface, e.g. the inner surface of a cylindrical hole, 
or an outer cylindrical surface, e.g. the outer surface 
of a cylindrical rod, of the workpiece, thereby to 
modify the surface, e.g. to quench or soft-nitride the 
surface. For treating the inner surface of a hole defined 
in a workpiece with a laser beam, it has been customary 
to apply a defocused laser beam to the inner surface of 
the hole. However, the inner surface of the hole cannot 
be treated stably because the raw laser beam emitted 
from a laser does not have a uniform energy distribution 
and has an unstable irregular beam diameter. One conventional device for converging a laser 
beam used to quench a workpiece is known from Japanese 
patent publication No. 57-47249, for example. The 
disclosed device has an internal reflecting mirror 
disposed in a path of a laser beam. The internal 
reflecting mirror has a reflecting surface for 
reflecting an outer circumferential portion of the laser 
beam into superimposed relationship to a core portion of 
the laser beam for thereby applying a laser beam having 
a uniform energy distribution or density to the surface 
of a workpiece which is positioned in a plane where the 
laser beam is focused. The conventional laser beam converging device with 
such an optical system is effective to treat the surface 
of a planar workpiece in the focused plane with the 
laser beam thus generated. However, an attempt to treat 
the inner surface of a hole defined in a workpiece with 
the converged laser beam is inefficient since only the 
outer circumferential portion of the raw laser beam is 
superimposed on the core portion thereof.  It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide an optical system for a laser beam generator, 
which is capable of producing a cylindrical laser beam 
of uniform energy distribution. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a laser beam generator for converging a laser 
beam onto a surface of a workpiece to treat the surface, 
comprising a mirror disposed in a path of a laser beam, 
the mirror having a plurality of successive conical 
taper surfaces on an inner surface thereof for dividing 
the laser beam into a plurality of ring-shaped laser 
beams and converging the ring-shaped laser beams onto 
the surface of the workpiece. The laser beam generator 
may also have a water jacket disposed
