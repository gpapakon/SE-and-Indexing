<ABSTRACT>
A method of performing handover of a call associated with a mobile 
station (P2) in one cell (3) but moving towards another cell (2), 

which includes making a first attempt, using for example a MUX1 
SNIFF procedure, on the channel allocated to the mobile station for 

that call, and if that attempt fails allocating the mobile station a 
different channel in the one cell (3) and making a second attempt. 

This different channel allocation (intracell handover) is performed 
even if there are no better signal characteristics achieved as a 

result. This procedure makes it more likely to be possible to achieve 
handover when a second mobile station (P1) associated with an 

adjacent cell (1) and operating on the same channel as the first 
mobile station (P2) is also within range of the basestation (5) of the 

other cell (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mobile communications and in particular to
cellular systems and handover between cells of such systems.Personal communication systems (PCS), which include those based
on CT-2, have handover between cells which is controlled by the
system itself. When a handover is required in CT-2 based systems
due to a mobile station (portable) being close to leaving a particular
cell, the surrounding cells (cell neighbours) are instructed to perform
a MUX1 SNIFF procedure. All of these cells which have a free radio
will tune to the portable's channel and try to decode the PID
(portable identity). If the PID can be detected, the base stations
detecting it will measure the RSSI (Received Signal Strength
Indication) and report this information to the system controller. The
portable is then handed over to the first basestation to respond
which had an adequate RSSI.A conventional cellular system is disclosed in WO-A-95 06 543.According to the present invention there is provided a method for
use in a cellular mobile communications system for performing
handover, from a first basestation to a second basestation, of a call
associated with a mobile station moving between adjacent cells
corresponding to said basestations, comprising the steps of making
a first attempt to achieve handover on the channel allocated to the
mobile station for that call, and if that attempt fails, allocating the
mobile station an alternative channel in the cell associated with the
first basestation and making a second attempt on the alternative
channel, characterised in that the alternative channel is allocated by 
an intra-cell handover process which is carried out even if the
alternative channel has no better signal characteristics than the
channel allocated for the call.The method has the advantage of reducing the risk of dropping a
call during handover.Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference
to the accompanying drawings, in which
Fig. 1 illustrates a handover situation when a SNIFF
instruction may fail, andFig. 2 is a handover algorithm for use in the situation of
Fig. 1.Referring firstly to Fig. 1, there is a potential problem with the
conventional MUX1 SNIFF handover procedure. Three cells, 1, 2
and 3 have respective basestations 4, 5 and 6. There is a portable
P2 with a call established in cell 3. It is however moving into cell 2.
Another portable P1 is in cell 1 where it overlaps with cell 2 and has
an established call. The portables P1 and P2 are on the same RF
channel. This is possible and

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a cellular mobile communications system
for performing handover, from a first basestation (6) to a second

basestation (5), of a call associated with a mobile station (P2) moving
between adjacent cells (2,3) corresponding to said basestations (5,6),

comprising the steps of making a first attempt to achieve handover
on the channel allocated to the mobile station (P2) for that call, and if that

attempt fails, allocating to the mobile station (P2) an alternative channel in
the cell (3) associated with the first basestation (6) and making a second

attempt on the alternative channel, characterised in that the
alternative channel is allocated by an intra-cell handover process

which is carried out even if the alternative channel has no better
signal characteristics than the channel allocated for the call.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that for
intercell handover the first basestation (6) instructs all surrounding

basestations (5) to try to locate the mobile station (P2) and handover is
performed to a basestation which locates it.
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the
surrounding base stations (5) are instructed to perform a MUX1 SNIFF

comprising tuning to the channel allocated to the mobile station (P2) for
the call, trying to decode the identity of the mobile station (P2), and in the

event of decoding the identity measuring the received signal
strength and reporting it to the first basestation (6), the first basestation

handing over the call to the basestation (5) which responds first with an

adequate received signal strength.
A method as claimed in claim 3, and including the step of
dropping the call if the second attempt failed.
A method as claimed claim 4 and including the step of
making a third attempt on a third channel if the second attempt

failed.
