<ABSTRACT>
A tire with reduced tread noise includes a tread having 
a plurality of base pitches (20A-J) arranged about the 

circumference of the tire in at least one pitch sequence. 
Each base pitch in the pitch sequence has a tread geometry 

defined by a plurality of load-supporting tread blocks (40A-E) 
separated or interrupted by grooves (47,49) and/or sipes 

(48). The base pitches in the pitch sequence have various 
tread geometries, to reduce the noise of the tire on the 

road surface. The grooves and/or sipes in each base pitch 
have common end points (60,61) along the leading 

and trailing edges of the base pitches such that the 
grooves and/or sipes are continuous across the boundary 

between adjacent base pitches in the pitch sequence. 
Likewise, the grooves and/or sipes in each base pitch in 

one rib or row in the tire can have common end points 
along the edge between a base pitch in an adjacent rib 

or row, such that the grooves and/or sipes are 
continuous in the lateral direction as well. The base 

pitches formed in this manner can be arranged in a 
particular pitch sequence regardless of: (i) the 

individual tread geometry of each base pitch, or 
(ii) the particular sequence of base pitches. Moreover, 

the length of the base pitches in the circumferential 
direction can also be varied by known manners (e.g., 

random, sinusoidal) to further reduce the noise of the 
tire on a road surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to tyres, in
particular to tyre treads, and is especially concerned with
the selection of novel tread dispositions with a view to
achieving low tyre tread noise.The tread of a modern tyre extends around the
outer circumference of the tyre and is designed to
contact the road surface. The tread is typically
divided into a plurality of raised, load-supporting
tread blocks separated by intersecting circumferential
and transverse grooves and/or sipes. The tread blocks
determine the control, acceleration and braking
characteristics of the tyre, while the grooves and/or
sipes are necessary to provide flexibility and water
removal.The tread blocks are typically arranged in "base
pitches" around the tire, wherein each base pitch
includes a predetermined geometry of whole and/or
partial tread blocks separated by grooves and/or sipes.
Each tread block in the base pitch may be separated from
the other tread blocks by circumferential grooves,
transverse grooves, and/or grooves which extend in other
selected directions. Likewise, the tread blocks can be
separated or interrupted by circumferential sipes,
transverse sipes, and/or sipes which extend in other
selected directions, as is known to those skilled in the
art. In other words, each base pitch has a particular
tread geometry which is chosen by the designer at least
in part according to the factors outlined above.Additionally, each base pitch may vary in width
across the tyre. For example, each base pitch may
extend transversely from one shoulder to the other
shoulder of the tyre. Alternatively, there may be 
several rows or ribs of base pitches, each of which
extends transversely over only a single circumferential
section or partial axial extent, e.g. over a single rib or
combination of ribs. In any case, the base pitches are
repeated around the circumference of the tyre to form
the complete tyre tread.The constant contact of the tyre tread with the
road surface during use can often create unwanted noise.
In particular, as the tyre contacts the road surface,
the individual tread blocks cause air disturbances upon
impact with the road, creating a spectrum of audio
frequencies broadly referred to as "tire noise". The
following factors contribute to tyre noise: (1) the impact
of the tread block on the road surface; (2) the
vibration of the tyre carcass; and (3) the "air pumping"
which occurs as the tread blocks become compressed and
expand into the grooves separating adjacent blocks.Various tread designs have been developed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tyre with a tread (15) having axially-spaced
circumferential shoulders (28,31) and a tread pattern of

tread pattern elements, namely load-supporting tread
blocks (40A-E) separated by grooves (45,47,49) and/or

sipes (48,50), between the shoulders;

the tread pattern being divisible, by lateral
boundaries extending across the tread parallel to the

tyre axis, into a circumferentially-extending sequence
(30,32) of base pitches (20A-E, F-J), each base pitch

having a pattern cell of tread pattern elements and at
least one tread pattern element in each base pitch being

a circumferentially-extending groove (49) or sipe that
intersects the lateral boundary of the base pitch, the

intersection being at an axial position
(60,61(A,B);63,64(A,B)) between the tyre shoulders that

is the same for all the base pitches in the sequence
(30,32) so that there is continuity of said

circumferentially-extending grooves (49) or sipes with
those of adjacent base pitches across the lateral

boundaries, and would be such continuity regardless of
the ordering of the base pitches in the sequence;
there being at least three different base pitch
pattern cells,

characterized in that the pattern cells are
distinguished from one another by

differing distances of lateral divergence of their
respective said circumferentially-extending grooves or

sipes within the cell from said axial position.
A tyre according to claim 1 in which the tread
pattern is divisible by one or more circumferential

boundaries into plural said circumferentially-extending
sequences of such base pitches extending round the tyre

side-by-side, grooves and/or sipes in the base pitches of
one sequence having continuity across the circumferential

boundary thereof with grooves and/or sipes in the base
pitches of the adjacent sequence.
A tyre according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which
different base pitch pattern cells have different

circumferential lengths.
A tyre according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in
which each said circumferentially-extending groove (49)

or sipe extends continuously across the respective base
pitch from one of its lateral boundaries to the other.
A tyre according to any one of the preceding claims
in which there are not more than seven different base

pitch pattern cells.
