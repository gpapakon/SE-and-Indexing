<ABSTRACT>
A child safety seat has a seat body (10, 12), a 
support structure (80), a first releasable coupling (84, 

88) for connecting the support structure (80) to a motor 
vehicle and a second releasable coupling (94, 96) for 

connecting the seat body to the support structure (80). 
The support structure (80) includes an upwardly facing 

abutment surface positioned above the seat portion (70) of 
an adult vehicle seat and in front of the backrest portion 

(72) thereof, when the first coupling (84, 88) is engaged. 
The second coupling (94, 96) is arranged to hold the seat 

body (10, 12) in rigid abutment with the abutment surface 
on the support structure (80) either so that the seat body 

(10, 12) is facing forwardly in the vehicle or so that the 
seat body (10, 12) is facing rearwardly in the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child safety seat for 
use in a vehicle of the type comprising a seat body, a 
harness for a child occupant of the seat secured to the 
seat body, a support structure, first releasable coupling 
means for connecting the support structure to a motor 
vehicle and second releasable coupling means for connecting 
the seat body to the support structure. A seat of this type is disclosed in GB-A-2254548. 
The support structure is arranged to be positioned on a 
vehicle seat and connected thereto by an adult seat belt 
which serves as the first coupling means. The second 
coupling means is secured to a backrest portion of the seat 
body and engages with a portion of the support structure 
which abuts against the backrest portion of the vehicle 
seat. The disadvantage of mounting a child seat in a 
vehicle by resting it on a vehicle seat and securing in 
place with straps arises from the inherent resilience of 
the springs and upholstery of the vehicle seat and also the 
resilience of the straps themselves. Even if the straps 
securing the child seat are pulled very tight during 
installation, such resilience will permit undesirable 
movement of the child seat relative to the vehicle in the 
event of sudden deceleration, for example during an 
accident. In order to overcome this disadvantage, it has 
been proposed to provide motor cars with standard anchorage 
units at agreed locations for engagement by releasable 
connectors which are rigidly coupled to a child's seat. 
The present invention is concerned with the provision of a 
child's seat of the type described above for attachment to 
such anchorage units. According to the invention, the support structure 
includes upwardly facing abutment means positioned above 
the seat portion of an adult vehicle seat and in front of 
the backrest portion thereof, when the first coupling means 
are engaged, and the second coupling means are arranged to 
hold the seat body in rigid abutment with said abutment  
 
means support structure either so that the seat body is 
facing forwardly in the vehicle or so that the seat body is 
facing rearwardly in the vehicle. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view from behind of a 
known child's seat modified for use in accordance with the 
invention; Figure 2 is a perspective view from in front of 
the seat shown in Figure 1: Figure 3 is a scrap view of an anchorage unit for 
permanent

<CLAIMS>
A child safety seat comprising a seat body (10, 
12), a support structure (80), first releasable coupling 

means (84, 86, 88) for connecting the support structure 
(80) to a motor vehicle and second releasable coupling 

means (94, 96) for connecting the seat body to the support 
structure (80), characterised in that the support structure 

(80) includes upwardly facing abutment means positioned 
above the seat portion (70) of an adult vehicle seat and in 

front of the backrest portion (72) thereof, when the first 
coupling means (84, 86, 88) are engaged, and the second 

coupling means (94, 96) are arranged to hold the seat body 
(10, 12) in rigid abutment with said abutment means on the 

support structure (80) either so that the seat body (10, 
12) is facing forwardly in the vehicle or so that the seat 

body (10, 12) is facing rearwardly in the vehicle.

support structure (80) to support in respective first and 
second orientations, the second coupling means (94, 96) 

being operable to connect the 
the first abutment surface (60) to the support structure 

(80) when the seat body (10, 12) is facing rearwardly and 
to connect the second abutment surface (62) to the support 

structure (80) when the seat body (10, 12) is facing 
forwardly.
