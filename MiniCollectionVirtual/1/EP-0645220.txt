<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for working on steel profiles, flat steels or sheet metals, having a roller table, feeding device for a workpiece lying on the roller table, and a working station with equipment for the cutting and/or non-cutting working of the workpiece, as well as a marking apparatus for providing the worked workpiece and the workpiece still lying on the roller table with marks. According to the invention, the marking device has a milling machine which is able to travel above the roller table at least transversely thereto and comprises a milling head, capable of being vertically advanced, with milling cutter. The milling machine is connected to a computer control system which controls, in accordance with the marks to be milled, the advance of the milling head, the feed movement of the milling head transversely to the roller table and the relative movement between the milling head and the workpiece in the longitudinal direction of the roller table.
