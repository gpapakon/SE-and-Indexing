<ABSTRACT>
Telephone terminals which differ in terms of the dialling mode used (pulse dialling or multifrequency code dialling modes) are to be connected to the small communication system. No earth indication is provided in the subscriber circuit for the pulse dialling unit. An enquiry is initiated by dialling a code in the case of an accepted incoming call connection, whereas, in the case of a connected terminal with multifrequency code dialling mode, this is effected by operating a signal key (flash). Time overlaps thus occur for the respective effected line interruptions, so that an unambiguous statement on the dialling mode of the terminal currently involved is not possible. Therefore, when a telephone terminal is connected, and also in the case of every incoming seizure, an evaluation is provided for dialling information relating to both types. If the assigned dialling mode is identified through activation of an evaluation, storage is effected in a memory space of a non-volatile memory through signals characterising this dialling mode concerned. When an enquiry is initiated during an accepted incoming call, the dialling mode assigned to the terminal concerned can be established by the controller by reading the contents of the memory space.

<CLAIMS>
Communications system, in particular small 
communications system, having a programmable system 

controller CPU by means of which the performance-feature-specific 
control procedures (such as a 

consultation procedure, for example) can be controlled, 
and having memory units in which information on the 

telephone terminals which are connected to said units 
and are to be connected either to one another or to a 

trunk line and the respective current state can be 
stored, and in which it is possible to connect 

telephone terminals which differ from one another in 
terms of the dialling method which is implemented 

either as a pulse dialling method or as a 
multifrequency code dialling method, and in which, in 

the case of a terminal with a pulse dialling method for 
which there is no final indication, a consultation 

takes place by dialling at least one code number and 
can be initiated in the case of a telephone terminal 

with a multifrequency code dialling method by 
activating a signalling key, characterized in that when 

an outgoing connection request is recognized, an 
evaluation possibility for dialling information of each 

of the two aforesaid dialling methods is made available 
simultaneously by the system controller, in that, when 

any telephone terminal (EG1, EG2) is connected, when an 
outgoing connection is set up for the first time as a 

function of which of the evaluations which have been  
 

made available responds to the dialling method assigned 
to the terminal, an identifier (KZ1) or (KZ2) which 

characterizes this respectively applicable dialling 
method is automatically written to a memory unit in a 

terminal-specific memory location, in that the 
identifier which is derived in the same way with each 

further outgoing connection is compared with the 
identifier which is written to this memory location on 

a terminal-specific basis, and in the event of a 
deviation it is overwritten with the newly determined 

identifier for the other dialling method, in that when 
a consultation has been initiated during an existing, 

accepted incoming call by the interrogation of the 
memory-location content by means of the respective 

identifier, the dialling method which is assigned to 
the respective telephone terminal can be detected in 

advance by the controller so that the 
dialling-information evaluation which is responsible 

for this dialling method is made available immediately. 
Communications system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a memory location of a non-volatile 

memory is used to store the respective 
identifier for the dialling method.
