<CLAIMS>
Telematic terminal (1) connected to an ISDN network (2)
with a flow rate of 64 kb/s and arranged to operate at a

first full useful data flow rate of 64 kb/s and at a second
lower useful data flow rate of 56 kb/s and comprising means

(11) for controlling the useful flow rate and means for
transmission and means for reception of communication start

flags of the HDLC type, characterised in that the
means for receiving HDLC flags comprise means (10) for

recognising non-standardised HDLC flags arranged to control
the useful flow rate control means (11).
Terminal according to claim 1, wherein the said
recognition means (10) are arranged to recognise, in the

received communication start flags , the presence of
an additional bit forced to 1.
Terminal according to one of claims 1 and 2, which is a
facsimile machine of the group G
4
.
Terminal according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
flag recognition means (10) comprise a shift register (12),

receiving serial data received by the terminal, and a
decoder with a logic gate and storage by flip flop (13).
Terminal according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
means for controlling the useful flow rate (11) comprise a

shift register (14) and a clock modification unit (15) and
a bit stuffing unit (16), these being controlled by the

register (14) of the control means (11) in order to modify,
as they present, the data and the clock.
Terminal according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein in
the full flow rate state the flow rate control means (11) are 

transparent.
Terminal according to one of claims 1 to 6, wherein, in
the low flow rate state, the flow rate control means (11) are

arranged to eliminate one clock bit out of eight.
Terminal according to claim 5, wherein the clock
modification unit (15) and the stuffing unit (16) are

connected in parallel between a series-parallel convertor
(5), connected to a processor (6), and a circuit (3) for

interface with a network (2).
Terminal according to claims 4 and 5, wherein the
decoder (13) is connected to the shift register (14) of the

flow rate control means (11).
