<ABSTRACT>
A rigid three-dimensional preform is made by 
moving a plurality of webs of fibrous reinforcement 

material superposed and coplanar to a cutter, the webs 
being coated with an electromagnetic energy-curable 

binder and pressed together. Prior to cutting a blank 
in a two-dimensional development of the three-dimensional 

preform from the webs, the webs are tacked 
together at spaced local zones by locally curing the 

binder at those zones by locally applying the 
appropriate electromagnetic radiation (microwave, 

ultraviolet, electron) so that the webs travel as one 
to the cutter. After cutting of the blank, the blank 

is loaded into a mold to replicate the three-dimensional 
shape of the preform and the remainder of 

the binder is cured in the mold by the application of 
the appropriate electromagnetic radiation. An 

auxiliary member may be attached to the preform by 
applying an electromagnetic energy-curable binder to 

at least one location on the preform, moving the 
auxiliary member into a desired position and intimate 

contact with the binder-coated location and the binder 
cured at that location by the application of the 

appropriate electromagnetic radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method of making a rigid 
three-dimensional preform, wherein a binder being curable by 
electromagnetic energy is applied to fibrous reinforcing 
material and the binder is cured by applying the 
electromagnetic energy to a blank being shaped from the 
fibrous reinforcing material to rigidize the blank into the 
desired rigid three-dimensional preform, and to an apparatus 
for making a rigid three-dimensional preform, comprising: 
means for applying a binder being curable by electromagnetic 
energy to a fibrous reinforcing material, means for forming 
a blank of the fibrous material into a predetermined shape 
of the preform and means for applying electromagnetic energy 
to the shaped blank to rigidize the blank into the desired 
rigid three-dimensional preform. Moreover the present invention relates to a method and to an 
apparatus for making structural reinforcement preforms for 
resin transform molding (RTM) and reaction injection molding 
(SRIM) processes for structural composites, and is further 
particularly concerned with the handling of reinforcement 
webs used in the process and in attaching reinforcement 
members and the like as a part or parts of the preforms. A method of producing a mat of fibrous material is disclosed 
in EP-A-0 178 679, wherein a stitching is proposed by 
bonding or welding of the fibres at predetermined locations 
by using laser energy, jets of hot air or flames. This known 
method, however, does ot use any binder material and does 
not provide for a further rigidization of the fibrous 
material for providing a rigid form or preform. In making preforms according to a directed fiber process, it 
has heretofore been the practice to spray chopped fibers 
with a binder resin onto a form that has air pulled 
therethrough to locate and hold the fibers in place. The  
 
form with the fibers and the binder resin thereon is then 
moved into a hot air plenum chamber, dried and/or cured to 
set the binder resin. In addition, a great deal of 
processing space is required for drying, curing and cooling 
the preforms. In making thermoformed preforms, it has heretofore been the 
practice to use a continuous strand fiber mat that has been 
previously coated by the fiber manufacturer with a 
thermoplastic binder. The thermoformable mat is supplied in 
a roll form whereby it is unrolled into flat sheets of 
varied layer thicknesses and clamped into a holding frame at 
the edges. The frame network is then positioned in an oven 
chamber containing radiant
