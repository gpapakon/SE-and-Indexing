<ABSTRACT>
An optical recording apparatus comprises 
optical recording mediums each of which comprises a 

single plate substrate and recording layers which are 
formed on both sides of the substrate and available for 

recording and reproduction or for recording, erasing and 
reproduction with irradiation of laser beams, both 

surfaces of the recording medium being available for the 
simultaneous access, and floating type optical thin 

heads which are provided at every side of the recording 
mediums and float from the respective surfaces of the 

recording mediums with maintaining specific distances 
therefrom for irradiating laser beams onto the recording 

mediums when the recording mediums are rotated. 
Combination of these optical recording mediums and 

optical heads makes it possible to stack plural pairs of 
them within a thin space, thus improving the on-line 

capacity of the optical recording apparatus to a great 
extent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
recording apparatus for recording informations on a 
recording medium with use of high density energy beams 
such a a laser beam. A rewritable optical recording medium is 
capable of being recorded at a density much higher than 
that of a rewritable magnetic recording medium, 
however, at present, the on-line capacity of the whole 
apparatus, that is, the recording capacity allowable for 
a simultaneous access, is about the same as that of a 
magnetic hard disk apparatus. There is therefore a demand for 
an optical recording apparatus having a 
larger on-line capacity. Heretofore, separately from the development of 
recording materials, there has been proposed a method in 
which recorded marks are recorded as closely as possible 
on the basis of the current bit-by-bit recording method 
using heat mode recording materials so as to increase 
the recording density in a surface. For example, there 
is known a method (US-A- 4,569,038) in which the shape of 
a groove for guiding the light is so designed as to 
reduce the influence of the reflected light from 
adjacent tracks, thereby making the pitch of the 
recording tracks small. With this method, however,  
 
the track pitch can be limited to about half of the 
present pitch at the best, because it is impossible to make it smaller 
because of an increase of cross-talk. 
Namely, the capacity can be increased only twice at the 
best. As another method for increasing the recording 
density using the conventional recording medium, there 
is known in general a method in which the wavelength of 
a laser beam, 80 nm or so at present, is shortened to 70 
nm, 60 nm, ..., for example, or the numerical aperture 
(N.A.) of an objective lens, about 0.5 at present, is 
increased to 0.6, 0.7, ..., for example, so that the 
size of the recorded marks is reduced to thereby 
increase the recording density. However, the former 
method should rely on development of a high power short 
wavelength semiconductor laser, while the latter method 
has a problem in that the existing optical recording 
technique such as focusing servo, inclusive of the 
structure of a recording medium and the structure of a 
recording head, is not applicable as it is in respect of 
the working distance of the objective lens as well as a 
considerable decrease in the depth of focus. In the magnetic hard disk apparatus, the 
number of recording surfaces available for the 
simultaneous access is increased by using a recording 
body comprising a plurality of
