<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel urea 
derivative containing a heterocyclic ring, and more 
specifically to a novel compound having an antihistaminic 
effect, useful as an antiallergic agent, and antiallergic 
agents containing the same. In recent years, various kinds of compounds 
have been known as antihistaminic antiallergic agents. 
Examples of the compounds include thiazole derivatives 
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 63-225374, piperidine derivatives disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-32821, phenyl derivatives 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 2-28566, and piperazine derivatives disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 63-188670. Currently used antihistaminic agents useful 
as the above-mentioned antiallergic agents have strong 
antihistaminic effects, but involve some side effects 
on the central nervous system, such as sleepiness and 
ataxy. Considering these undesirable side effects, 
improved antiallergic agents have been developed. In 
general, however, new compounds which alleviate undesirable 
side effects also have decreased antihistaminic 
effects. Thus, there is a need for compounds having 
high antihistaminic and antiallergic effects which do 
not have undesirable side effects.  The compound of this invention is represented 
by the following Formula I. 
wherein Z¹ is C or N; m¹ is 0 when Z¹ is N and m¹ is 1 
when Z¹ is C; R³ can form a bond with R² when Z¹ is C; 
A¹ is O, SO₂, or CH₂; n¹ is 0 or 1 when A¹ is O or SO₂ 
and n¹ is an integer of 0 to 3 when A¹ is CH₂; R¹ is a 
group selected from the group consisting of a condensed 
aromatic ring, a substituted condensed aromatic 
ring, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, and 
wherein R¹¹ is H or OH, or R¹¹ can form a bond with R² 
when Z¹ is C and n¹ is 0; R¹² and R¹³ are independently 
phenyl, substituted phenyl, a heterocyclic ring, or a 
substituted heterocyclic ring, or R¹² and R¹³ can form 
a condensed ring; R² is H when forming no bond with R³ 
or R¹¹; R³ is H when forming no bond with R²; k¹ is an 
integer of 2 to 5; Y¹ is a group selected from the 
group consisting of O, S, SO, SO₂, CH₂, and 
wherein Z² is N or C; m² is 0 when Z² is N and m² is 1 
when z² is C; A² is O, SO₂, or CH₂; n² is 0 or 1 when 
A² is O or SO₂; n² is an integer of 0 to 3 when A² is 
CH₂; R⁴ is a group selected from the group consisting 
of alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, a heterocyclic 
ring, a substituted heterocyclic ring, -CO-R⁴¹, and 
wherein R⁴¹ is a group selected from the group
