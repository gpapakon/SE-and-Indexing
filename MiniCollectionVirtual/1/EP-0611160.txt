<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of classifying and 

sorting by shape crystalline objects such as synthetic 
diamonds in which an image of the object taken from an 

angle defined in relation to the object is compared to 
one or more templates in order to characterize the 

object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
and method for reliably, precisely, and quickly 
classifying and sorting crystalline objects according 
to shape. Synthetic diamonds are crystalline objects 
that are used as abrasives. The quality of industrial 
diamonds for use in abrasive applications is dependent 
on their shape. Regular diamonds, like other cubic-system 
crystals, take the form of cubes, octahedrons, 
or shapes intermediate between cubes and octahedrons. 
The intermediate shapes are the fourteen-sided solids 
which are obtained by truncating the corners of either 
a cube or an octahedron. In order to have optimal 
abrasive properties the shape of a diamond should lie 
midway between a cube and a octahedron. Diamonds produced by ordinary synthetic 
methods exhibit a wide range of shapes. By changing 
the parameters of the production process the operator 
may exercise some control over shape in response to 
feedback information regarding diamonds previously 
produced. Because of market demand for the preferred 
shapes, the synthetic diamonds produced by ordinary 
methods are sorted by shape before they are sold. 
However there presently is no means for classifying and 
sorting synthetic diamonds which is simultaneously 
reliable, precise, and quick. It is known to classify diamonds by eye into 
nine shape groups lettered A through I, A being an 
octahedron and I being a cube. Shapes C, D, and E are 
preferred for diamond abrasives. This method is 
imprecise and not practical for sorting production  
 
quantities of diamonds. For sorting of diamonds during 
production a shaker table is used. The shaker table 
separates the diamonds into eight classes designated 
Cup 1 to Cup 8. Cup 1 diamonds roll most easily and 
are the most desirable, whereas Cup 8 diamonds roll 
poorly and are least desirable. Cup 1 diamonds consist 
of a large percentage of shapes C, D, and E. However, 
the shaker tables are unpredictable in their operation 
and the same diamond will not always go into the same 
cup. The distribution of diamonds into the various 
cups is difficult to characterize and depends on 
peculiarities in the construction of the shaker table 
in a manner that is neither easily understood nor 
precisely reproducible. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need 
for a means of reliably, precisely, and quickly 
classifying and sorting crystalline objects such as 
synthetic diamonds which can be used in both analytic 
and production applications. The present invention is directed to an 
apparatus
