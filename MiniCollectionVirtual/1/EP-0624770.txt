<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanging apparatus is disclosed which includes a 
heat exchanging reservoir (1) for containing a heat dissipating 

bath fluid (F) therein, a heat convecting unit (2) including a fluid 
pathway for flowing a perfusate (E) therethrough, and an immersion 

adjusting mechanism (3,6) attached to at least one or both of the 
heat convecting unit (2) and the heat exchanging reservoir (1). The 

heat convecting unit (2) is accommodated in the heat exchanging 
reservoir (1) so as to be immersed in the bath fluid (F) at a prescribed 

extent of immersion. The immersion adjusting mechanism (3,6) 
is constructed to control the extent of immersion of the heat 

convecting unit (2) in the bath fluid (F). Changing the effective heat 
convecting surface area, i.e., the extent of immersion of the 

heat convecting unit (2) in the bath fluid (F) by the immersion adjusting 
means (3,6) will afford ready and easy control of the effluent (E) 

temperature, with minimal time lag, over a wide range of temperatures, 
without ever changing the bath fluid temperature to 

a new one.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat exchanging apparatus 
designed to allow control of the perfusate temperature easily, 
promptly and economically. The use of heat exchangers is widespread in multiple 
fields, either to cool a warm fluid or to warm a cold fluid. 
In the medical field these devices must be sterile, and preferably 
disposable, which implies limitations as to the design and 
materials that can be used to construct them. Changing the 
temperature of the heat dissipating bath fluid allows cooling 
or warming the perfusate fluid using the same heat convecting 
unit. Conventional heat exchangers require changing the temperature 
of the entire bathing fluid volume to induce a change 
of the perfusate temperature. Since the temperature exchange 
efficiency is a function of the heat convecting surface area, 
for a given configuration of that convecting surface (coils, 
convoluted spirals, straight tubes, parallel corrugated sheets, 
etc), the exchanging capabilities will be maximized by forcing 
the bathing fluid to move around, to maintain the maximum 
temperature gradient which facilitates the transport of the 
heat to or from the heat convecting unit to the heat dissipating 
bath fluid. To effectively pump and circulate the bathing 
fluid at a high flow rate around the heat convecting unit, this 
has been encased within a small closed chamber, and the bulk of 
the bathing fluid compartmentalized, together with the refrigerating 
or warming device within another large main tank. Although conventional heat exchangers are very efficient,  
 
controlling the effective heat convecting surface area is 
precluded by design. Changing the bathing fluid circulating 
flow rate and/or the temperature of the bath fluid itself are 
the only means to change the perfusate or effluent temperature. 
The ready temperature control range achievable by changing the 
bath fluid circulating flow rate is rather limited; and changing 
the temperature of the entire bath fluid volume is time and 
energy consuming which precludes effecting prompt perfusate 
temperature changes. It also requires sophisticated but 
costly means to change and to maintain the temperature of the 
bathing fluid to and at the newly chosen one. This invention is aimed at solving these shortcomings 
providing a simple and economic means to control the effluent 
temperature easily, promptly and very effectively over a wide 
range, without the need of changing the temperature of the 
bathing fluid with highly sophisticated but expensive temperature
