<ABSTRACT>
In the case of electronic memories in which at least part of the data content is not changed over relatively long periods, it is necessary to allow for the possibility that individual memory cells change value in the course of time. If the memories are used in safety-critical applications, these faults must be recognisable. For systems in which the data are present on two channels, the invention provides that, at specified minimum time intervals, check data are generated from the information which is present in the two memories or memory areas, and that these sets of check data are then compared with each other. The check data consist of only a few bytes, which can be compared with each other without thereby appreciably affecting the processing of the information. For safety-critical applications, the data comparison should be effected in a computer or comparator with secure signalling. For applications which are not safety-critical, a comparison between the individual computers or an external comparison in an insecure computer is enough.
