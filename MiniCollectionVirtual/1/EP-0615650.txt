<ABSTRACT>
With an extremely short laser pulse with not too high an intensity it is possible to ionize deuterium, or helium into coherent bosons such as coherent deuterons and coherent alpha particles. To achieve this coherence it is important that certain critical conditions are satisfied so that plasma instabilities such as stimulated Raman scattering, stimulated Brillouin scattering, parametric instability have not enough time to grow to destroy the coherence. The electrons created during the multiphoton ionization process also must not recombine with the ions or to destroy the coherence of the ions by electromagnetic scattering. With the creation of coherent deuterons and coherent alpha particles together, the fusion rate of coherent deuterons into coherent alpha particles will be greatly enhanced. The nuclear fusion energy thus released can be utilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method and Apparatus for Generating Nuclear Fusion Energy By Coherent BosonsBackground of the Prior Art The interaction of a laser pulse and deuteri pellets have been going on for many years in connection wi inertia confinement fusion schemes. For example, Lawren Livermore Laboratory in California has a huge laser us continuously on experiments of fusion. However, the durati of the laser pulse is generally of the order of a nanosecon In this range of time, deuterium will be ionized into plasm and the plasma will develop instabilities. Plasma instabilitie are one of the most difficult problems to confront in t fusion community. According to the present invention, a las pulse is used which is about ten thousand times or more shorte in duration, and the intensity of the laser pulse is muc smaller so that plasma instabilities do not have time t develop.In the conventional inertia confinement scheme t idea is to increase the density of the deuterium to get the tw deuterons closer and to increase the temperature to ignite th nuclear fusion. In the present invention, there is no attemp to this. Instead, utilized is the coherent effect of th bosons involved to enhance the nuclear fusion rate so tha nuclear fusion can be accomplished in an extremely shor duration of time. It is desired that the deuterons stay a cold as possible so that their coherence is not destroyed.Laser pulse to ionize deuterium with one singl photon per atom to initiate nuclear fusion utilizing coheren effect has been disclosed by the present inventor in U.SSerial No. 338,706 "Enhanced Fusion Decay of Deuterium" (Apri 12, 1990) and is further discussed in PCT/US89/02366 an PCT/US90/01990, all incorporated herein by reference. Th single photon then must have energy above 13.6 eV, which is th ionization energy of the deuterium atom. Such laser i classified as ultraviolet laser and is currently not availabl 

 commercially. The current scheme is to use a multiphot ionization mechanism to ionize deuterium so that no ultraviol laser is necessary. The precise conditions for multiphot ionization has been determined. ■ This discussion is examined in two parts:.(iϊ Production of coherent bosons from multiphot ionization.(IJ-) Enhancement of nuclear fusion rate amo coherent bosons, with figure for apparatus. While discussed herein is the use of superflu deuterium, other forms of deuterium may be used. The deuteri must just be cold enough to achieve the results describe Recommended temperatures of deuterium are from liquid heli temperature to room
