<ABSTRACT>
Expandable rivets with a head (1) at the top, a central slotted expandable part (2) and a retaining part (6) at the bottom can be used as blind-rivet nuts or blind-rivet screws. The production of the slotted central expandable part involves high costs and furthermore the known expandable rivets have a round retaining part, with the result that when the expandable rivet is used corotation occurs. To allow economical manufacture of an expandable rivet with a non-circular retaining part (2), the proposal is to extrude from below into a blank with a head (1) and an adjoining shank (2) a central recess, of shorter length than the shank (2), and to extrude into the outside of the shank spaced groove-like channels (4) extending over the length of the shank and then to make a recess in the blank thus deformed, the said recess extending from the head to the retaining part at the bottom and being situated in a diameter such that the groove-like recesses (4) are cut open in the central expandable part.

Process for manufacturing a ram sleeve comprising an upper
head, a middle slotted ram portion and a lower holding portion,


characterised in that
 into a blank comprising a head (1) and a
thereto adjacent shaft (2) is flow-pressed from below a central

cutout (3) of shorter length than that of the shaft, and thereafter
groovelike notches (4) are flow-pressed, which due to further

pressuring of the central cutout into the shaft exterior extend in
the direction of the shaft's longitudinal direction at a distance from

each other over the length of the shaft; thereafter, into a thus
preshaped blank is entered from the head (1) to the lower holding

portion (6) a cutout at a diameter which cuts free the groovelike
notches in the middle ram portion.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 entering the
central cutout (3) and pressuring by flow-pressing the groovelike

notches (4) is performed in one working process.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the
shaft of the blank is flow-pressed into a rectangular, square or

triangular cross-section.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

an internal thread (7) is produced in the lower holding portion (6).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

in the lower holding portion (6) is conventionally mounted the shaft
(9) of a bolt (8) which upwardly protrudes over the head (1).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that

the lower holding portion (6) has an outside diameter which is
smaller than the diameter set by the groove base of the notches

(4).
