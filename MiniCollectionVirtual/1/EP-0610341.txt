<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a beverage thickener/emulsifier system which is a blend of three materials: propylene glycol alginate (a surface active thickener), xanthan (a pseudoplastic thickener) and guar gum (a Newtonian thickener). This system provides very stable oil-in-water emulsions in beverages and provides full bodied beverage texture even at acid pH. The system uses a low total gum level (below 0.4 % in a single strength beverage) yet provides a very stable oil emulsion without excessive thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a beverage thickener/emulsifier 
system which is a blend of three materials: a surface active thickener, 
e.g. propylene glycol alginate, a pseudoplastic thickener, e.g. 
xanthan and a Newtonian thickener, e.g. guar gum.  
 
This system provides very stable 
oil-in-water emulsions in beverages and provides a full bodied 
beverage texture even at acid pH. Acid beverages, for example soft drinks, fruit punches, fruit 
juices, and like refreshments contain flavor oils. In addition, 
unless the sugar and/or pectin level is high they need an additive 
to provide body or mouthfeel. Gums and other thickeners are added 
to provide texture and mouthfeel. Flavor oils and clouding oils 
are usually emulsified into the beverage with emulsifiers or 
weighting oils. Other oils may also be desired to provide 
additional richness and opacity. One of the problems with emulsifiers and thickening materials 
is that at acid pHs, particularly in the range of 3-4, the gums 
can be unstable and ineffective. Another problem is that the 
emulsification properties of the gum solution change over time and 
the flavor oil or other oils separate to form a ring at the top of 
the beverage. Weighting oils have been used to prevent this oil 
separation, but they have not been entirely successful. The level 
of weighting oil is ineffective in systems with high total oil 
levels. Other preventive measures include adding less oil or 
excessive levels of gums or thickeners. Some of the thickening agents are pseudoplastic, i.e., they 
become less viscous or thinner upon shearing. This then provides 
a beverage which gives a thick mouthfeel but which is also easy to 
swallow. However, these types of materials do not always function 
as emulsifiers to keep the flavor oil in solution and to provide 
the appropriate mouthfeel at the lower acid pHs.  
 It has been found that a thickener/emulsifier composed of a 
surface active thickener, e.g., propylene glycol alginate, a 
pseudoplastic thickener, e.g. xanthan, and a Hewtonian thickener, 
e.g., guar gum, used in specific combination provides a beverage 
in which the oil system is stable without providing an unacceptably 
thick texture. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a 
thickener/emulsifier system which is pseudoplastic providing 
stability in the beverage without excessive thickness. It is a further object of this invention to provide a thickener\emulsifier 
system which keeps flavor oil and clouding oils 
suspended even at low pH. These and
