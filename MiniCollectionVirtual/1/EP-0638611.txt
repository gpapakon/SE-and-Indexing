<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel solid dimensionally 
stable polymer blend which is effective as a VI-improver 
lubricant additive when employed in a lubricating oil 
composition. The art contains many disclosures on the use of 
ethylene copolymer additives for lubricating oil 
compositions. Ethylene-propylene copolymers and ethylene-alpha 
olefin and non-conjugated diene terpolymers, as well 
as their functionalized derivatized modification are 
illustrative of this type of oil additive. The use of 
copolymers as additives in lubricating oils dictates that 
they possess certain essential properties. The copolymers 
must be suitably soluble in the oil solution in order to 
provide the properties intended for the lubricating oil. 
Additionally, the copolymer must not promote undesired 
reactions, either with the lubricating oil or with other 
additive components used in the fully formulated 
lubricating oil composition. The basic building blocks of the copolymers of the 
invention are primarily the monoolefins, such as ethylene, 
propylene and higher alpha-monoolefins, optionally, with 
minor amounts of a polyene, i.e., a non-conjugated diene 
or triene. More specifically, the building blocks 
comprise ethylene and at least one C₃-C₁₀ alpha-monoolefin 
polymerized according to known methods to produce the 
copolymer or terpolymer additive.  There are many methods for copolymerizing the noted 
olefins, and the resulting products may vary widely in the 
specific olefin components, in their molecular weights, 
and in the physical properties present in the final 
copolymer product. Amorphous ethylene copolymers have 
been widely employed as additives for lubricating oil 
compositions, either in the neat form or after being 
functionalized and/or derivatized to add additional 
properties to the additive for incorporation in the 
lubricating oil formulation. While conventional amorphous 
copolymers (OCP) and their derivatives show good viscosity 
index improving properties in lubricating oils they do not 
possess good dimensional stability at molecular weights 
suitable for modern premium lubricating oils. An ethylene 
copolymer that flows under ambient conditions, i.e., is 
characterized by having cold flow properties, is not 
dimensionally stable. Partially crystalline ethylene copolymers are also 
known and are characterized by having excellent 
dimensional stability. The dimensional stability of a 
copolymer is a particularly valuable property for 
facilitating the shipping or transport (particularly the
