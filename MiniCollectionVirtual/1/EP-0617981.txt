<ABSTRACT>
An implantable heart defibrillator (1) with a shock pulse 
generator for delivering a defibrillation shock to a heart 

(25), the delivered energy being mechanical. The shock pulse 
generator consists of an electromechanical energy converter 

(40) which generates e.g pressure, by means of a 
piezoelement (43), in a pressure chamber (46). Pressure is 

transmitted by a fluid (57) in an electrode (50) devised 
like a hydraulic line to a balloon-like electrode head (59) 

in contact with heart tissue. The generated pressure causes 
the electrode head (59) to expand and deliver a mechanical 

shock to the heart (25) corresponding to the pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an implantable heart
defibrillator. More specifically it relates to a heart
defibrillator set forth in the preambula of claim 1.A modern automatic, implantable defibrillator, e.g. as
described in Current Problems in Cardiology, Volume XIV, No.
12, Dec. 1989, Chicago, Troup J.P. "Implantable
Cardioverters and Defibrillators", p. 699 ff, especially
FIG. 14 and its legend, includes a cardioversion and pacemaker
stimulation capability for both tachycardia and
bradycardia, in addition to a defibrillation function, and
is sometime referred to as an AICD (automatic implantable
cardioverter defibrillator). In AICD defibrillation, an
attempt is made to induce all heart cells to depolarize
simultaneously by imposing a strong electrical field across
the heart, i.e. the heart is electrically shocked. The
electrical shock takes the form of electrical pulses which
can sometimes be emitted in patterns of varying spatial and
temporal sophistication.Achieving depolarization of heart cells by mechanically
touching them is also known. The result is a heart beat
achieved mechanically. One possible explanation of this
phenomenon is that mechanical contact causes leakage from
the cellular ion channels. A change then occurs in ion
concentrations inside and outside the cell membrane, thereby
triggering depolarization and, thus, a heart beat.However, this knowledge has not found any application in the
art of defibrillation which, with the exception of devices
for injecting fibrillation-terminating drugs into the heart,
e.g. EP-A-429141, has concentrated exclusively on 
defibrillation by electrical shock.But considerable electrical energy (about 5 - 40 J) is
required for defibrillation. So tissue subjected to the
shock could be damaged. For e.g. this reason, the art is
attempting to reduce the electrical energy needed for
defibrillation.One procedure for achieving this reduction mechanically is
described in US-A-4,925,443, which relates to an artificial,
implantable mechanical support function for ventricular
compression of the heart. However, any defibrillation
necessary in the patient is performed electrically. The
mechanical support function is used in conjunction with
defibrillation only to compress the heart so a lower level
of electrical defibrillation energy can be used.One object of the invention is to terminate a fibrillation
condition in the heart by supplying the heart with a non-electrical
shock instead of an electrical shock.According to the invention, this object is achieved by
