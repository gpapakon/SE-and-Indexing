<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a broom boom for tunnel cleaning apparatuses, with which a rotationally drivable revolving broom (brush) (4) can be adjusted to its particular working region, spraying nozzles (10, 16), which can likewise be adjusted to the working region, for washing and rinsing liquid being arranged in front of and behind the broom (4) on the boom (1) and there being provided on the boom (1, 2) an apron-like, domed partial cover (7) for the rear of the brush, which partial cover encloses the broom from the boom until beyond its bearing, provision is made for a second apron part (11) which can be extended via a drive device (13) from a rest position overlapping the partial cover (7), via selectable intermediate positions, to an end position enclosing the broom (4) together with the partial cover through at least 170@. Spraying nozzles (16) for the rinsing liquid can be attached to this second apron part (11).
