<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for monitoring the biological activity of a culture of microorganisms. This process consists in determining an unknown culture condition (presence of toxic product, number of cells, substrate concentration) of a culture of microorganisms (yeast) giving rise to release of gas (CO2), by cultivating this culture in a container (5) at the same time as a control culture of the same microorganisms in the container (3), under the same conditions except for one of them, and by determining, after a suitable length of time, using the sensor (39), the pressure difference between the containers (3) and (5), which conveys information regarding a variation in the biological activity between the two cultures because of the different culture condition to be determined.
