<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a binder composition for powder coatings. The binder composition is substantially based on a mixture of an unsaturated polyester and an oligomer having a plurality of allyl groups and further having at least either ether and ester groups or urethane and optionally ether groups. The oligomer is preferably an allyl ether ester being more preferably the ester of trimethylolpropane diallyl ether or pentaerythritol triallyl ether and a polycarboxylic acid (anhydride).

<DESCRIPTION>
 BINDER COMPOSITION FOR POWDER COATINGSThe invention relates to a binder composition for powder coatings and to a process for the preparation of this composition. As appears from the article "Powder Coatings inEurope" by Morandini (Pitture e Vernice 9/88, page 70), powder coating binder compositions are sought which permit polymerisation or curing at lower temperatures, for example in 10-30 minutes at 130°C. The object of the invention is to provide such a binder composition.This object is achieved in that the binder composition is substantially based on a mixture of an unsaturated polyester and an oligomer having a plurality of allyl groups and further having at least either ether and ester groups or urethane groups.This gives a composition which permits both hardening of the coating at higher temperatures, for example between 160°C and 240°C, for example over 3-15 minutes, and hardening at lower temperatures, for example between 110°C and 160°C over 10-30 minutes.The glass transition temperature of the composition preferably is at least 10°C and more preferably at least 20°C. In DE-A-2742270 a fluid composition is described based on 50-60 wt unsaturated polyester and 40-50 wt% allylethergroups containing compounds. This reference does not contain any indication that solid compositions could be made that are suitable as powder coating and that exhibit good mechanical properties combined with good acetoneresistance.The binder composition combines the property of being low temperature curable, with other desired coating 

properties such as, for example, hardness, flow, colour stability, scratch resistance and excellent drying properties.Preferably, the compound has 2-12 allyl groups, more preferably, the compound has at least 4 allyl groups. Preferably the compound has allylether groups and further ester or urethane groups.Preferably, the compound having allyl groups has a molecular weight higher than 200, more preferably higher than 300. Preferably, the compound has a molecular weight lower than 1700, preferably lower than 1200. Preferably, the compound having allyl groups has a molecular weight per allyl group lower than 350, more preferably lower than 200. As a rule, the molecular weight per allyl group is about 100 or higher.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the oligomer is an allyl ether-ester, more preferably being the ester of trimethylolpropane diallyl ether or pentaerythritol triallyl ether and a poly- carboxylic acid (anhydride).Suitable polycarbox lic acids and
