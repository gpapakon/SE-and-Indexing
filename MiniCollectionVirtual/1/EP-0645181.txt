<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method of treating a water-swellable clay 
after the clay has been mined and dried to improve its 

properties when in contact with contaminated water. 
After the common initial drying of the clay to a 

moisture content of 12% by weight or less, the clay is 
impregnated with an aqueous solution containing a 

dissolved, water-soluble polymer, in an amount of at 
least about 0.5% by weight based on the dry weight of 

the clay, and the clay is wetted to a moisture content 
of more than 12% by weight, preferably at least about 

15% or more, based on the dry weight of the clay, and 
then redried to a moisture content of 12% by weight or 

less, based on the dry weight of the clay. This 
rewetting step to hydrate and polymer-impregnate the 

clay, and then redrying the clay, unexpectedly improves 
the contaminated water absorbency, and viscosity 

properties when the clay is in contact with 
contaminated water; unexpectedly increases the rheology 

properties of the clays for oil well drilling fluids 
and lost circulation fields when contaminated water is 

encountered during drilling, enhances the clay 
properties when used as a suspending agent in the 

cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries when the 
composition contains a dissolved, inorganic salt and/or 

an organic liquid; and provides unexpectedly increased 
contaminated water-absorption in forming water-swellable 

clay-based water barriers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method 
of improving the contaminated water absorption ability 
of smectite clays, preferably a water-swellable 
smectite clay, such as sodium bentonite, and a method 
of improving the adsorption ability and flocculating 
capability of non-swelling smectite clays, such as 
calcium bentonite clays. The preferred method of 
improving water-swellable smectite clays, in accordance 
with the present invention, includes the steps of 
drying the mined water-swellable clay, homogeneously 
mixing the dried clay with a water-soluble polymer, 
then rewetting the clay and polymer with water to 
impregnate the clay with the water-dissolved polymer, 
and then redrying the clay. The processed, rewetted, 
polymer-impregnated, and redried water-swellable clay 
is unexpectedly better for use as a contaminated water-absorbent 
or barrier for the formation of ponds, 
lagoons and hazardous waste containment areas; for use 
in oil well drilling fluids wherein contaminated water 
is encountered during drilling; for use in lost 
circulation fluids where contaminated water is 
encountered in drilling; for use as a contaminated 
water-absorbing material to form a contaminated water 
barrier in panels, and in flexible, multi-layer 
articles; for use in contaminated water-absorbent 
articles, such as diapers, tampons and the like; and 
for any other purpose and in any environment wherein a 
water-swellable clay is used for its water-absorption  
 
properties for absorption of contaminated water. 
For use in improving the absorbing capability and the 
ability to flocculate with other particles of smectite 
clays, the clay, e.g., calcium bentonite, optionally, 
is first acid-activated, dried to a moisture content of 
about 12% by weight or less, mixed with a water-soluble 
polymer, and rewetted to a moisture content of at least 
about 15% by weight to solubilize the polymer, and 
impregnate the clay with the polymer, followed by 
redrying. Water-swellable smectite clays have a great 
number of industrial uses that rely upon the ability of 
the clay to absorb many times its weight in water. 
Such water-swellable clays, such as sodium bentonite, 
however, lose much of their absorbency if the water 
absorbed is contaminated with water-soluble metal salts 
of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, particularly 
the sulfate or halide salts, such as sodium chloride, 
magnesium chloride, calcium bromide, calcium chloride, 
potassium chloride, salt-containing body fluids and the 
like. Some bentonite
