<ABSTRACT>
A system for scanning a room (10) to find the location of target devices (14-16), and 
then locking onto them with stationary directed beams (26,26') for two-way communication. 

In one embodiment, a base system in each room comprises an IR source/receiver (18,19) 
combination plus an LCD display panel (20) which covers the source/receiver (18,19) and is 

addressed in such a way as to open up dynamic apertures (25) through which IR radiation in a 
scanning mode can be directed toward any particular location in the room (10). When a device 

(14,15) at that location senses that it is being irradiated by the base station, the targeted device 
responds by emitting a coded packet of IR pulses. This system takes advantage of the higher 

bandwidth communication that can be obtained with point-to-point communications, while 
still allowing for multiple devices at arbitrary locations in the same room.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical beam steering system, and in particular to a system for
controlling the direction in which emitting devices emit or receiving devices receive optical radiation.There are many applications involving the emission or reception of optical radiation where
being able to limit the solid angle of the path over which an optical beam travels can have significant
benefits.From another aspect, reducing multipath reflections from optical beams significantly
increases the usable bandwidth of optical communication links.One example, which is not meant to be limiting, is directed to a system for a room or other
enclosure containing, at arbitrary locations, a large number of devices and one central diffuse infrared
(IR) radiation source, the object of which is to locate one or more particular devices and lock onto
them with stationary directed beams.In a large room, radiation from a diffuse IR source travels in all directions. Light beams
scattered from various surfaces in the room arrive with varying time delays at a given receiver,
causing significant limitations on the bandwidth of transmitted data. This multipath problem limits the
communication bandwidth to on the order of (3.0 x 108 m/sec)/d, where d is a characteristic length for
the room. The relevant characteristic length will vary from one to several times the dimension of the
room. In practice, this can limit the usable bandwidth to under 10 Mbit/sec.Altschuler et al. disclose, in Optical Engineering, November/December 1981, Vol 20, No.6,
pp. 953-961, a laser electro-optic system for three dimensional topographic mapping of surfaces.
There is described a method for remote three-dimensional mapping of an unknown and arbitrarily
complex surface by rapidly determining the three-dimensional locations of MxN sample points on the
surface. Digital 3-D locations defining a surface are acquired by (1) optically transforming a single
laser beam into an (expanded) array of MxN individual laser beams, (2) illuminating the surface with
the array of MxN simultaneous laser beam, (3) using a programmable electro-optic modulator to
switch on and off specified subsets of laser beams, so as to illuminate the surface with a sequence of
mathematical patterns (space code), (4) image recording each of the mathematical patterns as they
reflect of the surface using a wavelength specific optically filtered video camera, and (5) analysing
the images obtained to obtain the 3-D locations of each of the MxN illuminated points on the surface
which are
