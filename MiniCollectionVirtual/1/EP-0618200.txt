<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of aminotriazine derivatives 
of the formula 
 
by the solvolysis of compounds of the formula 
 
in the presence of gaseous hydrogen chloride in an alcoholic medium. The compounds of formula I are useful intermediates in the manufacture of agrochemicals, 
particularly insecticides, as described in EP-A-0 314 615. A process for the preparation of aminotriazine derivatives is described in EP-A-0 433 218 
in which compounds of formula II above are converted to compounds of formula I by 
acidification and cleavage of the -COR4 group as carboxylic acid in the presence of 
aqueous HCl. Disadvantages of known processes, including that described in EP-A-0 433 218, are 
unsatisfactory product and volume yields for efficient industrial scale production, and 
instability of the end product in the reaction mixture. A further shortcoming of known  
 
processes is the establishment of an equilibrium state which cannot be shifted adequately 
to the product side so that the reaction remains essentially incomplete. Surprisingly it has now been found that a substantial increase in product yield and purity, 
and a shift in the equilibrium state is obtained by replacing aqueous hydrochloric acid by 
hydrogen chloride gas. Furthermore the decomposition of the end product in the reaction 
medium is prevented. It is the object, therefore, of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation 
of 4-amino-3-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazine derivatives of the formula 
 
wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1-C12alkyl, C3-C6cycloalkyl, C1-C4alkoxy-C1-C6alkyl, 
C1-C2haloalkyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, phenpropyl, phenbutyl or phenpentyl, or a 
phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, phenpropyl, phenbutyl or phenpentyl radical that is mono- or 
di-substituted by halogen, C1-C5alkyl, C1-C2haloalkyl, methoxy and/or ethoxy; 
R2 is hydrogen, C1-C6alkyl or C3-C6cycloalkyl, or is phenyl that is unsubstituted or 
substituted by C1-C12alkyl, halogen or by C1-C12haloalkyl, or 
R1 and R2 together form a saturated or unsaturated 3- to 7-membered carbocycle, and 
R3 is hydrogen or C1-C6alkyl, 
by the solvolysis of compounds of the formula 
 
wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined in formula I, and R4 is H, C1-C4-alkyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl, 
C1-C4-alkyl substituted by 1 to 9 chlorine atoms, C1-C3-alkoxy, C1-C3-alkylthio, phenyl, 
pyridyl, or phenyl or pyridyl which is substituted with 1 to 3 substituents selected from the 
group consisting of halogen, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, methylthio and
