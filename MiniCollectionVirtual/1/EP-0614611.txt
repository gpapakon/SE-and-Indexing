<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists in a process and an apparatus for treating and preserving feed and/or harvested crops by means of a combination of microwave and air drying and comprises   a) subjecting the material to be treated, if appropriate after determining its initial moisture content (6), to a microwave pretreatment (5) at an energy level which results in a disrupted cell surface structure and in which the cell fluid is essentially retained; b) subsequently subjecting the pretreated material to a low-temperature air-drying step (8) in a temperature range from 70 to 110@C, depending on the intermediate moisture content (11), most of the moisture being removed from the material, and c) a predetermined residual moisture of the dried material being set and d) the waste heat being recovered from the apparatuses for carrying out the process and, if appropriate, from further apparatuses for operating or preheating the air-drying apparatus.
