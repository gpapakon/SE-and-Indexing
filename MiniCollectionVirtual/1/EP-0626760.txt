<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a programmable integrated electronic system including a matrix network of identical cells (53). Each cell includes functional elements (530) which are capable, when they are correctly connected, of executing a given function, and programmable connection means (a to h) in order, on the one hand, to connect the functional elements together and, on the other hand, to connect the cell to its neighbours. The present invention is characterised in that the system includes means for storing a first information item which defines the function of each of the cells of the network, and in that each cell has means for extracting, from this first information item and from its position in the network, the programming word for its own function. Moreover, means are provided for carrying out the test of correct operation of each cell and for reconfiguring the network in the event of defective cells.

<CLAIMS>
Integrated electronic system comprising a matrix network of identical cells,
each cell comprising a plurality of functional elements and first connection

means for connecting said functional elements such that said cell is
capable of implementing a given function, and second connection means

for connecting each cell to its neighbours; said electronic system being

characterised in that
 it furthermore comprises:

storage means for storing a first piece of data which
represents the functions of the entirety of the cells forming said

network;
extraction means for extracting, from said first stored piece of
data, second pieces of data, each of said second pieces of data

representing the function of a single one of said cells of the network;
and
programming means for programming, in each cell, said first
and said second connection means from said second pieces of data,

thus defining the function of said cell in the network, and 
in that
 said
extraction means extract said second pieces of data by combining

said first piece of data and a code which is representative of the
position of said cell in the network, in such a way that said system

may be reprogrammed in case of failure of one or more cells of said
matrix.
Electronic system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said storage
means are communal to all the cells of the network.
Electronic system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said storage
means belong to each of the cells of the network.
Electronic system according to any of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
that
 each cell comprises:

test means for testing the functioning of the functional
elements and of the connection means of the cells which are 

adjacent thereto and for transmitting to the latter a failure signal in
the case of malfunction;
deactivation means which, in response to said failure signal,
deactivate said cell by short-circuiting its inputs and its outputs such

that it is transparent in the network; and
reconfiguration means for re-programming another cell so that
this said other cell is able to implement the function which was

previously assigned to the defective cell.
Electronic system according to any of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
that
 each cell comprises:

test means for testing the functioning of its functional
elements and of its connection means and for transmitting, to the

cells which are adjacent thereto, a failure signal in the case of

malfunction of one of said adjacent cells;
deactivation means which, in response to said failure signal,
deactivate the defective cell by short-circuiting its inputs and its

outputs such that it is transparent in the network; and
reconfiguration means for re-programming another cell so that
this said other cell is able to implement the function which was

previously assigned to the defective cell.
Electronic system according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised in that
 said
failure signal from a defective cell is transmitted to all the cells of the line

and of the column of this defective cell, and 
in that
 the deactivation means
of these cells are provided so as to deactivate them in response to said

failure signal.
Electronic system according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised in that
 said
failure signal from a defective cell is transmitted to all the cells of the line of

this defective cell, and 
in that
 the deactivation means of these cells are
provided so as to deactivate them in response to said failure signal.
Electronic system according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised in that
 said
failure signal from a defective cell is transmitted to all the cells of the

column of this defective cell, and 
in that
 the deactivation means of these
cells are provided so as to deactivate them in response to said failure

signal. 
Electronic system according to any of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in
that
 said functional elements comprise logic blocks.
Electronic system according to any of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in
that
 said functional elements comprise analogue blocks.
