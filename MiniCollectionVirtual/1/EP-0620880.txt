<ABSTRACT>
A dock leveler (1) comprising a ramp (7) hinged at its rear end to a supporting structure (6) and movable between a generally horizontal position and an upwardly inclined position. A lip (9) is hinged to the forward edge of the ramp (7) and can be pivoted between a downwardly hanging pendant position and an extended position. Interposed between the ramp and the supporting structure is an inflatable bag (12), while a second inflatable bag interconnects the ramp and the lip (21). Blowers (26, 30) mounted beneath the ramp (7) supplies low pressure air to both bags, and inflation of the first bag will move the ramp upwardly to the inclined position, while inflation of the second bag will move the lip from the pendant to the extended position.

<DESCRIPTION>
 - -DOCK LEVELER INCORPORATING AN INFLATABLE BAGBackground of the Invention A dock leveler is frequently employed to span the gap between a loading dock and a carrier or truck parked in front of the dock to enable material handling equipment, such as a fork lift truck, to pass freely between the dock and the truck bed.One common form of dock leveler is an upwardly biased mechanical type, which is mounted within a pit or depression formed in the upper surface of the loading dock. The dock leveler includes a supporting frame that is located within the pit, and a ramp or deck plate is hinged at its rear edge to the frame and can be pivoted from a generally horizontal position, where the ramp is flush with the upper surface of the dock, to an upwardly inclined position. Attached to the forward edge of the ramp is a lip which can be pivoted between a downwardly hanging pendant position and an outwardly extended position, where it forms an extension to the ramp. In an upwardly biased dock leveler, the ramp is biased or urged to the upwardly inclined position by a counterbalancing spring assembly, which is located in the pit beneath the ramp and is connected to the rear edge of the ramp through a lever arm. The force of the counter- balancing spring assembly will urge the ramp to the inclined position.The typical upwardly biased dock leveler also includes a holddown, which is a one-way locking device that permits downward movement of the ramp, but will pre- vent upward movement of the ramp unless released. The typical holddown is located beneath the ramp and is connected between the undersurface of the ramp and the supporting frame.To pivot the lip to the extended position, the conventional dock leveler includes a lip lifting and locking mechanism. With a mechanism of this type, the lip is automatically pivoted to the extended position, as 

 the ramp is moved downwardly from the inclined position, and the lip is locked in the extended position.The conventional upwardly biased dock leveler also includes cross traffic legs, which are pivoted to the forward edge of the ramp and are adapted to engage supports on the frame to maintain the ramp in the horiÂ¬ zontal position. To enable the ramp to move downwardly to a below dock level position, the typical legs can be pivoted to a retracted position through a manually operated cable mechanism.To begin a loading operation, an operator standing on the loading dock, will release the holddown to enable the ramp to pivot upwardly under influence of the counterbalancing

<CLAIMS>
I claim:
1. A dock leveler to be mounted on a loading dock, comprising a supporting structure, a ramp having a rear end hinged to the supporting structure and movable between a generally horizontal position and an upwardly inclined position, an inflatable member interposed between the supporting structure and the ramp, and inflating means connected to said inflatable member for inflating said member with a compressible fluid to thereby move said ramp from the horizontal to the inclined position.
2. The dock leveler of claim 1, wherein said inflatable member is a flexible bag.
3. The dock leveler of claim 2, wherein said inflating means comprises a blower capable of developing a pressure in the range of 0.5 to 5.0 psig in said bag.
4. The dock leveler of claim 2, wherein said bag has an upper surface engaged with the undersurface of said ramp, said upper surface has an area in the range of 5 to 25 square feet.
5. The dock leveler of claim 3, wherein said blower is mounted on the undersurface of said ramp.
6. The dock leveler of claim 1, wherein the upper surface of said bag when said bag is inflated is disposed at an acute angle with respect to the horizontal.
7. The dock leveler of claim 2, wherein the loading dock has an upper surface and a pit in said upper surface, said bag disposed between the underside of the ramp and the bottom of the pit.
8. The dock leveler of claim 1, and including a lip hinged to a forward edge of said ramp and movable between a downwardly hanging pendant position and an extended position where said lip forms an extension to said ramp, and a second inflatable member connected between said ramp and said lip, said inflating means being connected to said second inflatable member whereby 


 inflation of said second inflatable member will pivot the lip from the pendant to the extended position.
9. The dock leveler of claim 1, wherein said second inflatable member is a second bag, said dock- leveler also including a first pressure member connected to said ramp and a second pressure member connected to said lip, said second bag being interposed between said pressure members.
10. The dock leveler of claim 9, wherein the area of said second bag in contact with said second pressure member is in the range of 100 to 500 square inches.
11. The dockleveler of claim 1, and including locating means for restraining shifting of said bag relative to the supporting structure as the bag is inflated and deflated.
12. The dockleveler of claim 2, wherein said bag is composed of fabric impregnated with a plastic material.
13. The dock leveler of claim 1, wherein said ramp and said supporting structure are generally parallel when the bag is deflated and said ramp is disposed at an acute angle to said supporting structure when said bag is inflated.
