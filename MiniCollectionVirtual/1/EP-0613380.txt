<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of physiologically acceptable
monomeric/polymeric materials in the preparation of a curable composition for
cartilage repair by in situ curing in a human or animal body.The use of physiologically acceptable polymeric materials in the preparation
of biomedical applicances such as hearing aids, artificial eyes and dentures is well
known, as is the use of polymeric materials as bone cements in the field of
orthopaedics. Such polymeric materials are often used in the form of a curable
composition which is initially in a fluid, semi-liquid, dough-like or other mouldable
form, but which cures or hardens at the temperature of use to form a strong solid of
physical properties dependent on the use to which it is being put. Examples of such
curable compositions are to be found in International Patent Application No.
WO89/03695 and GB Patent 2 107 341 which disclose the use of curable
compositions comprising a powdered methacrylate polymer mixed with an acrylic
monomer. For such applications as the preparation
of hearing aids, artificial eyes and dentures which require dimensional accuracy, it is
important to provide compositions of low linear curing shrinkage and GB Patent 2
107 341 is directed to such an aim. For use as bone cement it is important to prevent
subsequent failure at the bone-cement interface and, to this end, WO89/03695
discloses the inclusion of a cell growth stimulant such as human growth hormone so
as to increase the rate of healing of, for example, a bone fracture and give a joint of
increased strength.EP-A 088,845 discloses a mixture of a monomeric and polymeric acrylate or
methacrylate, the monomeric component comprising a saturated oxygen-containing
heterocyclic ester, especially tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate or methacrylate, as having
low shinkage upon curing at room temperature, thus imparting dimensional stability.
This polymeric material is proposed for "biomedical" use, e.g. in the aural, opthalmic,
surgical and dental fields, especially in the manufacture of hearing aids, dentures,
tooth fillings and crowns. Use as a bone cement is also suggested. EP-A 032 249 describes a mixture of tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate with
polyethyl methacrylate as a dental resin for making a temporary, but tough and
adherent crown-and bridge.M. P. Patel and M. Braden, "Heterocyclic methacrylates for clinical
applications", Biomaterials 12, 649-652 (September 1991), have described
compositions of tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate and polyethyl methacrylate for
producing low
