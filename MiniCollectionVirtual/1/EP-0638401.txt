<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for profile extruding or tube extruding a mixture of plant particles, in particular wood particles, with binding agents, the mixture being compressed by the ram of an extruder in a filling space and solidified in the curing channel. The filled material is forced through a filling and pressing space, this space widening in the form of a wedge towards the curing channel, so that the filled material experiences uniform compression in the pressing direction. Due to the uniform compression in the length of each extruded piece produced with the pressing stroke, the pressure acting on the bounding walls of the filling and pressing space will be approximately uniform over the length when the final compression of the extruded part is reached.

<CLAIMS>
A process for extruding or tube extruding a mixture of 
vegetable particles, in particular wood particles with binders, 

in which the mixture is compacted by the male form of an extruder 
in a loading chamber and solidified in a hardening channel, 

characterized in that the load is pressed through a loading and 
pressing chamber which widens in the shape of a wedge towards the 

hardening channel, so that the load undergoes the same level of 
compaction in the direction of pressing. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
extrudate parts and billets are produced by the compaction which 

is at the same level over. the length of each extrudate part 
generated by a pressing stroke. 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
as a result of the compaction which is at the same level in the 

length of each extrudate part generated by a pressing stroke, the 
pressure acting on the delimiting walls of the loading and 

pressing chamber is at approximately the same level over the 
length when the final compaction of the extrudate is achieved. 
An apparatus for carrying out the process according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the loading and pressing chamber of an 

extruder device is widened in the shape of a wedge towards the 
hardening channel.
