<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to particular bis-naphthalimides, viz. 
2,2'-[1,2-ethanediylbis(methylimino-2,1-ethanediyl)]-bis[5-nitro-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione], 
2-[2-[N-methyl-N-[2-[[2-(5-nitro-1,3-dioxo-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-2(3H)-yl)ethyl]amino]ethyl]amino]ethyl]-5-nitro-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione, 
2,2'-[1,2-ethanediylbis(imino-2,1-ethanediyl)]-bis[5-nitro-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione], 
pharmaceutical 
compositions containing them, and their use for preparing medicaments for 
treating solid tumor carcinomas in mammals. Harnisch et al., U.S.Patent 4,919,848 discloses 
naphthalic acid imides useful as charge-regulating 
substances useful in electrophotographic toners. Brana et al., U.S. 4,874,863 discloses anticancer 
compounds of the formula:  
 
 
wherein X1, X2, X3 and X4 are identical or different and 
are each H, NO2, NH2, C1-C6-alkylamino, di-C1-C6-alkylamino, 
OH, C1-C6-alkoxy, halogen, 
trihalomethyl, C1-C6 alkyl, formyl, C1-C6-alkylcarbonyl, 
C1-C6-acylamino, ureyl, C1-C6-alkylureyl, 
or C1-C6-alkylcarbonylamino and R 
is a straight chain or branched C4-C10-alkylene 
which is interrupted at one or two points in the 
chain by a secondary-or tertiary amino group, where 
2 nitrogen atoms may additionally be bonded to one 
another by an alkylene group, or a salt with a 
physiologically tolerated acid. Brana et al., U.S. Patent 4,874,863 does not 
specifically disclose the compounds of the present 
invention. The compounds specifically disclosed in U.S. 
4,874,863 are substantially less soluble than the 
compounds of the present invention and therefore present 
formulation problems when trying to formulate such 
compounds into a dosage form suitable for human use. It has been found that the compounds of the present 
invention have dramatically increased water solubility 
which is an unexpected advantage over the compounds of 
the above identified patent. In addition, the compounds of the present invention 
exhibit unexpected superior antitumor activity relative 
to the compounds specifically disclosed by Brana et al.  
 There is described a compound of the formula: 
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein: 
R1 and R2are independently H or CH3. Specifically preferred compounds of the invention 
are: 
2,2'-[1,2-ethanediylbis(methylimino-2,1-ethanediyl)]-bis[5-nitro-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione];
