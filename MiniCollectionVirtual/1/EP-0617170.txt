<ABSTRACT>
The mobile apparatus has a motor-driven rotor drum which is accommodated in a housing. The drum consists of a rotor shaft (5) on which there is fixed a hollow shaft (20) with a fixed terminal flange (21). Diamond cut-off discs (23) and spacer rings (24) are arranged in a row in alternate sequence on the hollow shaft (20). At least two holding bars (22) running parallel to the hollow shaft (20) pass through the diamond cut-off discs (23) and the spacer rings (24) and are mounted in a counter-flange (25) which is held on the hollow shaft (20) so as to be secure (26) against rotation. The diamond cut-off discs are thus mounted on the hollow shaft (20) in a manner held together positively and non-positively to form an assembly. As a result, a steady mounting of the diamond cut-off discs is obtained and a great cutting depth of the apparatus is achieved.

Movable material-removing surface-working
apparatus, having at least one motor-driven rotor drum

which is arranged on a rotor shaft (5) supported in the
housing (4) of the apparatus, with the rotor drum

consisting of a hollow shaft (20) mounted on the rotor
shaft (5) and on one side having a fixed flange (21) to

which at least two holding rods (22) extending parallel
to the hollow shaft (20) are secured, with a plurality

of diamond cutting discs (23) and spacer rings (24)
being lined up on the hollow shaft (20), with at least

one spacer ring (24) being arranged, in each case,
between two adjacent diamond cutting discs (23), and

with the diamond cutting discs (23) and the spacer
rings (24) having at least two holding rods (22)

passing through them and being held on the hollow shaft
(20) not only in a form-locking, but also in a force-locking

manner, characterised in that on the drive side
the rotor shaft (5) is non-removably mounted in the

housing (4) of the apparatus, whilst the opposite shaft
end (14) is mounted such that it can be plugged into a

bearing housing (12) which is installed on a cover (11)
of the housing (4) and has a radial ball bearing (13)

secured therein, and in that the hollow shaft (20) is
slipped onto the rotor shaft (5) in an exchangeable

manner and is held by a locking flange (25) which is
secured to resist torsion.
Surface-working apparatus according to claim
1, characterised in that the pluggable end of the rotor

shaft (5) has the form of a peg (14) which fits into
the ball bearing (13), with an annular groove (15),

into which an O-ring (16) is inserted, being let into
the peg (14).
Surface-working apparatus according to claim
1, characterised in that the hollow shaft (20) in its

two end areas corresponds exactly to the diameter of 
the rotor shaft (5) in these areas, whilst the area

lying in between is of larger diameter.
Surface-working apparatus according to claim
1, characterised in that the rotor shaft (5) has, on

its pluggable side, a thread (32) onto which a locking
ring (29) is screwed that secures the hollow shaft (20)

in an axial direction.
Surface-working apparatus according to claim
1, characterised in that arranged on the rotor shaft

(5) on the drive side there is a secured (35) stop
flange (34) which has at least one axis-parallel

carrier pin (36) which is able to engage in a
corresponding bore in the fixed flange (21) of the

hollow shaft (20).
Surface-working apparatus according to claim
1, characterised in that the thickness of the spacer

rings (24) corresponds at least approximately to the
thickness of the diamond cutting discs (23).
