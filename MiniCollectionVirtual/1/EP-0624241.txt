<ABSTRACT>
Method for position measurement, whereby a magnetic field is generated in a measuring volume comprising one or several elongated elements of amorphous material, the magnetic properties of which being influenced by the magnetic field, is arranged in the measuring volume. The measuring volume is composed of several sub-volumes, and the extension of the sub-volumes in the desired measuring direction is chosen in such a way that the extension corresponds to the desired measuring resolution in the measuring directions. The change in magnetic or mechanical properties of the element caused by the magnetic flux intensity in the respective sub-volume along the longitudinal direction of the element is detected, the change being a measure of the position of the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for measuring position and angle. When measuring the position of a measuring body or an 
angular alignment of the measuring body in relation to a 
reference axis it is of advantage if the measuring body can 
move freely in a measuring volume, i.e. without bearing on 
a measuring path or the like. It would also be of advantage 
if the sensing of the measuring body could take place without 
contact. One object of the present invention is to achieve a 
method which makes such a measurement possible. 
Furthermore, according to a further development of 
the invention a procedure has been achieved which makes a 
dynamically adjustable accuracy of measurement possible in 
a given measurement volume. The measurement procedure according to the present 
invention is based on the fact that certain magnetic and mechanical properties 
of elements in the shape of bands, threads or strips 
of a material, which is amorphous, are changed when the elements 
are exposed to a magnetic field, called a 
bias field. For example, the magnetic field in the longitudinal or axial direction of the amorphous element is related to the position/direction of the element, 
thereby making the mechanical resonance frequency of the 
element a measure of the position/direction of the element. 
The same procedure is adaptable for a measuring component 
comprising an amorphous element which is magnetically 
connected to an inductive element which in turn is a part 
of an electric resonance circuit. When the magnetic field 
is changed, the magnetic properties of the amorphous 
elements are changed so that the inductance of the inductive 
element is changed. Thereby the resonance frequency 
of the electric resonance circuit is also changed.  
 WO-A-88/01427 teaches a method for measuring the 
position of an amorphous elongated element with respect 
to a known magnetic field pattern by determining the 
offset of the resonance frequency of the element which is 
brought about by the magneto-mechanical coupling of the 
element to the field.  
 The resonance frequency of an amorphous element exhibiting 
a comparatively great magneto-mechanical coupling 
is varied with the intensity of the magnetic flow along the 
main direction of the element by what is called the delta-E-effect. 
Thus, if this intensity of magnetic flow is 
changed as a function of the position/direction of the 
amorphous element the resonance frequency of the amorphous 
element will be a function of its position/direction. It is 
very
