<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to titanium aluminide 
alloys and, more particularly, to a gamma titanium 
aluminide alloy having dramatically improved high 
temperature creep resistance to increase the maximum use 
temperature of the alloy over currently available 
titanium aluminide alloys developed for aircraft use. The ongoing search for increased aircraft engine 
performance has prompted materials science engineers to 
investigate intermetallic compounds as potential 
replacement materials for nickel and cobalt base 
superalloys currently in widespread use for gas turbine 
engine hardware. Of particular interest over the past 
decade have been gamma or near-gamma titanium aluminides 
as a result of their low density and relatively high 
modulus and strength at elevated temperatures. Modifications have been made to the titanium 
aluminide composition in attempts to improve the 
physical properties and processability of the material. 
For example, the ratio of titanium to aluminum has been 
adjusted and various alloying elements have been 
introduced in attempts to improve ductility, strength, 
and/or toughness. Moreover, various processing  
 
techniques, including thermomechanical treatments and 
heat treatments, have been developed to this same end. An early effort to this end is described in Jaffee 
U.S. Patent 2 880 087 which discloses titanium aluminide 
alloys having 8-34 weight % Al and additions of 0.5 to 5 
weight % of beta stabilizing alloying elements such as 
Mo, V, Nb, Ta, Mn, Cr, Fe, W, Co, Ni, Cu, Si, and Be.
