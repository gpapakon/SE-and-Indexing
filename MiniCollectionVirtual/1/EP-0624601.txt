<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing raw rubber from a 
deproteinized natural rubber is disclosed, which comprises 

coagulating rubber particles in the deproteinized natural 
rubber latex by: (1) adding a nonionic surfactant having a 

cloud point of from 20 to 100째C and a molecular weight of 300 
or more to the deproteinized natural rubber latex and heating 

the latex to a temperature not lower than the cloud point of 
the nonionic surfactant; or (2) adding a coagulation 

assistant selected from the group consisting of: (a) an 
anionic surfactant, (b) an amphoteric surfactant, (c) a 

nonionic surfactant, (d) a nonionic or amphoteric oligomer or 

polymer, and (e) an anionic oligomer or polymer, to the 
deproteinized natural rubber latex; and then recovering the 

coagulated rubber particles. According to the process of the 
present invention, raw rubber containing substantially no 

metal ion can be produced with a high efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing raw rubber. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a process for producing raw rubber 
comprising coagulating rubber particles in a deproteinized 
natural rubber latex. Natural rubber has hitherto been used widely as 
industrial products, such as automobile tires, belts and 
pressure-sensitive adhesives, and household goods, such as 
gloves. These natural rubber articles are generally produced 
by coagulating the rubber content of a natural rubber latex 
to obtain raw rubber called crepe rubber or smoked sheet 
rubber, and further processing the raw rubber through steps 
of mastication, compounding of additives, molding, and 
vulcanization. It was recently reported that medical tools made of 
natural rubber, such as surgical gloves, various catheters, 
and analgesic masks, provoke labored respiration or 
anaphylactoid symptoms, such as vascular edema, nettle rash, 
detelectasis and cyanosis, in patients. Cases were also 
reported in which women with a history of allergy suffered a 
pain in the hands, nettle rash or vascular edema around the 
eyes when they used rubber gloves made of natural rubber.  
 These symptoms seem to be attributed to the protein 
present in natural rubber. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), U.S.A. has called on manufactures of natural rubber to 
reduce the protein content. It has therefore been demanded 
to remove protein from natural rubber. Natural rubber is obtained from Hevea trees as a 
latex containing a rubber content, water, protein, inorganic 
salts, and other impurities. The latex oozing out from the 
tapped trunk of a rubber plant is collected in a cup, 
gathered at a refining factory where it is coagulated to 
obtain raw rubber (crepe rubber or smoked sheet rubber) or 
concentrated by centrifugation to obtain a purified latex. The protein content in natural rubber has usually 
been expressed in terms of a nitrogen content (N %) 
determined by a Kjeldahl method multiplied by 6.3. The 
present inventors discovered that the proteins in raw rubber 
obtained from a latex can be confirmed by infrared absorption 
at 3280 cm-1 characteristic of polypeptide. The present inventors previously found that a 
deproteinized natural rubber latex showing no IR absorption 
at 3280 cm-1 can be obtained by a process comprising treating 
a natural rubber latex with a protease and a surfactant 
either simultaneously or successively and, after allowing the 
system to stand for a given period of time, recovering the 
ru

latex by adding a nonionic surfactant having a cloud point of 
from 20 to 100째C and a molecular weight of 300 or more to the 

deproteinized natural rubber latex and heating the latex to a

The process of claim 1, wherein said nonionic 
surfactant having a cloud point of from 20 to 100째C and a 

molecular weight of 300 or more is added in an amount of from 
0.01 to 10 % by weight based on the solids content of the 

deproteinized natural rubber latex. 
Use of a nonionic surfactant having a cloud point 
of from 20 to 100째C and a molecular weight of 300 or more as 

a coagulating agent for a deproteinized natural rubber latex.
