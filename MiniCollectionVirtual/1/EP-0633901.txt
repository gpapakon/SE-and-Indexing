<DESCRIPTION>
NO BORNENE POLYMERIZATION INITIATORS AND POLYMERS PREPARED THEREWITH BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel compound, its use as an initiator in anionic polymerizations yielding norbornene-terminated homopolymers of block copolymers, and the further use of said norbornene-terminated polymers as macromonomers in the preparation of graft copolymers. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTAnionic polymerization proceeds by attack on a vinyl monomer of a basic (nucleophilic) species resulting in the heterolytic splitting of the double bond to produce a carbon anion followed by propagation of this ion. The most common initiators used in such polymerization reactions are the alkyl and aryl derivatives of alkali metals, particularly lithium alkyls. Organolithium initiators are particularly preferred since they are readily prepared by reaction of the lithium metal with alkyl or aryl halides and are soluble in the hydrocarbon solvents used in their preparation as well as solvents used in solution polymerization reactions. N-butyl lithium and sec-butyl lithium are generally preferred initiators used for the anionic polymerization of vinyl and diolefin monomers including vinyl aromatic monomers, acrylic and methacrylic monomers and diolefin monomers such as butadiene or isoprene. A representative detail of organo-lithium initiators and their method of preparation appears in U.S. Patent 3,890,408. 

 In a further development of this chemistry, organolithium initiators containing vinyl unsaturation have been used to initiate polymerization of anionically polymerizable monomers to produce vinyl terminated macromolecules which may be then used as a macro eric component in the preparation of copolymers by ionic or free radical polymerization techniques to produce graft copolymers containing the vinyl macromonomer which provides the pendant graft chains. For example,U.S. Patent No. 3,235,626 to aack, assigned to Dow Chemical Company, describes a method for preparing graft copolymers of controlled branch configuration. It is described that the graft copolymers are prepared by first preparing a prepolymer by reacting a vinyl metal compound with an olefinic monomer to obtain a vinyl terminated prepolymer. After protonation and catalyst removal, the prepolymer is dissolved in an inert solvent with a polymerization catalyst and is thereafter reacted with either a different polymer having a reactive vinyl group or a different vinyl monomer under free-radical conditions.This art suffers
