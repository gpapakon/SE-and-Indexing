<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a stripper element (4) mounted on a system bearing (3) of a stripping device (1) for the discharge end of a conveyor belt (2); this stripper element has: a stripping disk (8) that is attached to the upper end of a disk support (9), a torsional spring joint which provides for spring-loaded slewing of the disk support about a horizontal axis, a base (6) for holding the torsional spring joint (7), a height-adjusting device (21, 26; 44, 51) for adjusting the height of the stripping disk (8) along a first axis (A1), a pivot bearing (17; 34) for pivoting the stripping disk (8) about a second axis (A2) to set the parallelism of the stripping edge of the stripper element (8) to the conveyor belt (2). For a compact design that provides for easy assembly, disassembly and adjustment, the invention provides that the first axis (A1) of the height-adjustment device (21, 26; 44, 51) and the second axis (A2) of the pivot bearing (17; 34) are aligned. As a result, the height-adjustment device and the pivot bearing can be mounted together as a structural unit in a tube jointing sleeve (5; 35).

<CLAIMS>
Stripper device (1) for the delivery end of a conveyor belt (2) with
a system carrier (3) and with stripper elements arranged on it, each

stripper element (8), having a stripper plate (8) engaging the
conveyor belt (2) in a peeling manner in its operative position, a

plate support (9) to the upper end of which is secured the stripper
plate (8), possibly a torsion spring pivot (7) on which the plate

support (9) is pivoted about a horizontal axis and guided in a
spring-loaded manner, a foot (6) on which the torsion spring

pivot (7) is held and which is mounted on the system carrier (3), an
adjusting device (21, 26; 44, 51) for adjusting the height of the

stripper plate (8) along an axis (A1) extending perpendicular to the
axis of the torsion spring pivot, as well as a rotary bearing (34) for

pivoting the stripper plate (8) about this axis (Al) for adjusting the
degree with which the stripper edge of the stripper plate (8) is

parallel to the conveyor belt (2), this axis (Al) making an angle of
less than 90Â° with the portion of the conveyor belt coming towards

the stripper plate (8),

characterised in that,

for each stripper element (4) there is secured on the system
carrier (3) a tubular sleeve (5, 35) in which the foot (6) having a

bearing bush (17; 38; 41) can be plugged and can be connected in a
non-rotatable manner to the tubular sleeve, the rotary bearing (34)

for the associated stripper element (4) being arranged in the bearing
bush.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the height
adjusting device (21, 26) is arranged in the bearing bush (17). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a securing
screw (18) is designed to be screwed into the bearing bush (17) for

axially longitudinally locating the bearing bush (17) in the tubular
sleeve (5).
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the head of the
securing screw (18) has a diameter which is somewhat smaller that

the inside diameter of the tubular sleeve (5), and that between the
securing screw (18) and the bearing bush (17) there is arranged a

squashable O-ring (19) which, with the securing screw (18)
tightened up, is pressed against the inner wall of the tubular

sleeve (5).
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that a groove is
formed in the inside wall of the tubular sleeve (5), into which the

O-ring (19) penetrates when the securing screw (18) is tightened.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
height adjusting device comprises an adjusting screw (26)

accessible through the securing screw (18) and held rotatably but
fixed in an axial direction on the securing screw (18) and engaging

in a locating bush (21) which is arranged in the bearing bush (17)
to be axially displaceable but prevented from rotation.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the
locating bush (21) contains an elongated hole (22) and the bearing

pin or foot (6) has at the same height position a transverse bore or
vice versa, and that a pin (23) extends through the elongated

hole (22) and the transverse bore so that the bearing pin or foot (6)
can pivot through a limited amount with respect to the locating 

bush (21) but is connected to it in a axial direction substantially
without any play.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that a
screw (44) which can be screwed in radially from outside is

provided in the wall of the tubular sleeve (35), its inner end (46)
serving to position the foot relative to the tubular sleeve (35).
Device according to Claim 8, characterised in that the screw (44)
has its inner end (46) engaging in a groove (43) extending in an

axial direction outwards on the outside of an intermediate
sleeve (38) and for securing the intermediate sleeve (38) in the

tubular sleeve (35) it presses it against the base of the groove.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the
intermediate sleeve (38), the bearing bushes (39, 40) and the

bearing pin (41) are sealed by a plug (49) at the lower end of the
intermediate sleeve (38), the diameter of the plug (49)

corresponding at most to the outside diameter of the intermediate
sleeve (38).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the
height adjusting device is formed by a set screw (51) engaging in a

threaded bore in the tubular sleeve (35) and moveable along the
axis (Al) by the at least one bearing pin (41).
