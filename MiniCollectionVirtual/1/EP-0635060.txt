<DESCRIPTION>
 MYOGENIC VECTOR SYSTEMSx' This invention was partially supported by a grant from the United_States government under HL-38401 awarded by the National Institute of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.5 Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to expression vectors for use in expressing polypeptides in myogenic cells. More particularly it relates to vectors containing the skeletal alpha actin gene promoter and the corresponding 3' transcribed but untranslated region of the gene and the 10 contiguous noncoding DNA containing the gene's natural transcriptional termination region.Background of the InventionActin is a contractile protein found in most cell types. Actin proteins are represented by similar but nonidentical isoforms which in warm blooded15 vertebrates are encoded by multigene families. Actin is expressed in a developmentally timed dependent and tissue specific manner, in which adult muscle tissues express exclusively the skeletal alpha actin gene as the predominant actin isoform. The nucleic acid sequence of skeletal alpha actin gene has been characterized in chicken, rat, mouse and human. Fornwald et20 al., Nucleic Acids Res., Vol. 10, pp. 3861-3876 (1982); French et al., Gene, Vol.88, pp. 173-180 (1990); Zak et al, Nature, Vol. 298, pp. 857-859 (1982); Hu et al, Mol. Cell. Biol., Vol. 6, pp. 15-25 (1986) and Minty and Kedes, Mol. Cell. Biol., Vol. 6, pp. 2125-2136 (1986).Once a gene has been characterized and sequenced it can be mappedâ€¢*.25 to determine its protein coding and noncoding portions. RNA transcripts are initiated from a promoter region start site at the messenger RNA cap and continue through the protein coding region to the noncoding region involved 

 with transcriptional termination. Post transcriptional processing of the RNA transcripts removes the noncoding introns to form a continuous coding sequence. Further, there is progressive trimming of the RNA transcript to the polyadenylation signals, found in the noncoding 3' untranslated portion of the processed messenger RNA. The levels of messenger RNA biosynthesis and accumulation is determined by parts of the unexpressed portion of the gene. For example the promoter, which is part of the unexpressed portion of the gene, is involved in determining gene expression. It regulates when and how the expressed gene is transcribed. The accumulation of RNA transcripts, however, may relate to the intrinsic stability of that RNA in a particular cell type. This intrinsic stability is dependent on
