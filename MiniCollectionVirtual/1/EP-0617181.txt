<ABSTRACT>
This roof comprises a ribbed support (1), the upwardly open ribs of which have perforated side walls (6) and are connected by regions (3), acoustically absorbing elements consisting of rigid bars (7) filling, at least partially, each rib (2) of the said support (1), a layer (9) of a thermally insulating material forming a vapour block covering the said support (1) and adhesively bonded via its lower face to the said regions (3), and an impermeable coating (10) covering the upper face of the thermally insulating layer (9). The rigid acoustically absorbing bars (7) are forcibly mounted in the said ribs (2) in a position such that their upper faces (8) are arranged substantially in the plane of the said regions (3) and hermetically seal the opening of the said ribs (2).
