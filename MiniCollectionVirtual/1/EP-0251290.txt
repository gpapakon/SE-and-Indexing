<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a fork-lift truck having a steering device (5 to 9) and operating device (13 to 18) which are actuated hydraulically, and having downstream of the hydraulic pump (1) a priority valve (3) to the preferred output (4) of which the hydraulic steering device (5 to 9) is connected, it is proposed for the purpose of reducing the number of parts susceptible to faults and of reducing the production costs to drive the travelling gear and the operating device (13 to 18) by electric battery, the aim being to drive the hydraulic pump (1) for the operating device (13 to 18) via an electric motor (24) controlled by a pulsed control (25). The arbitrarily controllable pulsed control (25) is additionally intended to be controlled as a function of a signal which is emitted from the steering device (5 to 9) and depends, for its part, on the pressure downstream of the steering valve (9).

A motor vehicle, in particular a lifting truck comprising a 
battery-electric travelling mechanism, a steering device with a 

hydraulic servo-steering device (5) and a hydraulic operating device 
(13 to 18), in the case of a fork-lift truck a lifting cylinder-piston 

assembly (17, 18) for the lifting frame, and comprising a pump 
(1) which act upon this operating device (13 to 18), is connected to 

an electric motor (24), and the flow control of which is controlled 
by means of a pulse control unit (25), and comprising a priority 

valve (3) which is connected to the conveying line (2) of this pump 
(1), and whose output (4) for the main flow is connected to the 

hydraulic servo-steering device (5), 
characterised in that 
the pulse 
control unit (25), which can be arbitrarily operated for the control 

of the operating device (13 to 18) is additionally controlled in 
dependence upon a signal which is emitted from the steering device 

(5) and which is dependent upon the pressure conducted in a control 
sinal line (11) following a steering valve (9), where this pressure 

is detected in a control member (30) and converted into an electric 
signal which is fed via an electric control signal line (31) to the 

pulse control unit (25). 
A motor vehicle as claimed in Claim I, 
characterised in that 
the signal emitted by the steering device (5) is dependent upon the 
difference between on the one hand the pressure in the main flow line 

(4) which leads from the priority valve (3) to the steering valve 
(9), and on the other hand the pressure which is conducted in the 

control signal line (11) following the steering valve (9), where this 
pressure difference is detected in the control member (30) and 

converted into the electric signal.  
 
A motor vehicle as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that 
a ramp-function control is provided for the current supply of 
the electric motor (24). 
A motor vehicle as claimed in one of the preceding Claims, 

characterised in that 
a constant speed regulating device is provided 
for the motor pump assembly (24, 1).
