<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a package including a bundle of 
shirred casing sticks disposed and held together by a 

container which completely encloses the bundle. The 
container is formed insitu about the bundle from a heat 

shrink film 16 which stiffens on heat shrinking to 
provide a self-supporting container conforming in shape 

generally to the bundle shape. During heat shrinking, 
portions 18 of the film are insulated by adhesive tape 

26 to prevent welding of these portions so they provide 
flaps which open to permit removal or replacement of 

sticks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shirred food casing
package and more particularly to a package including a bundle of shirred
casings retained in a container formed of a resilient shrink film.Small diameter sausages such as frankfurters or the like
usually are made using food casings of cellulose. Cellulose food casings
or the like customarily are manufactured in long continuous tubular
lengths. For handling convenience, these long tubular lengths are
gathered into pleats by shirring and are longitudinally compressed by
known techniques to obtain a shorter, relatively rigid tubular element
known in the industry as a shirred casing stick. The coherency of a
shirred stick is derived in part from the shirring operation which forms
the casing into generally conical pleats which nest one within another.During a stuffing operation the stick is loaded onto a
stuffing horn and a food emulsion is fed through the horn and into casing
which is drawn forward from the stick by the stuffing pressure. It is not
uncommon for a shirred stick 50 cm long to contain upwards of 50
meters or more of casing so a large number of individual frankfurters are
made with each stick.Packaging and shipping of shirred sticks presents several
problems particularly for the type of casings used for frankfurters which
generally have a wall thickness of only about 0.025 to about 0.05 mm. 
For example, shirred sticks of this casing are relatively fragile in that the
nested pleats of casing formed by the shirring operation are easily
separated or pulled apart. If the pleats separate, the stick is said to
break or lose "coherency". The result is one or more rigid shirred
sections connected by loose unshirred sections. Sticks in this condition
are not easily loaded onto a stuffing horn and are not at all suitable for
automatic stuffing operations wherein the stick is loaded onto a stuffing
horn by mechanical means. Accordingly, the packaging for the shirred
sticks must be able to minimize stick breakage.Shirred sticks also are susceptible to damage if made wet.
Since stuffing machines frequently are hosed down with water after a
stuffing operation, any sticks in the area must be retained in packaging
which provides a barrier to water spray and is not itself damaged by
water contact.In commercial practice it generally is customary to package
sticks in tight bundles of fifty (50) sticks. Bundling sticks together
accomplishes several functions. For example, if the sticks are tight
together, there is less likelihood of relative motion between
