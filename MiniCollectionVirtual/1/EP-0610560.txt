<ABSTRACT>
The assembly to process bakery products, esp. spherical shapes, has an initial conveyor system for them and a second conveyor system (48,60,70) for sugar, with a trough (60) below the first conveyor. The second conveyor system (48,60,70) has a swing ramp (70) extending upwards from the trough (60). Pref. the initial conveyor system has a longitudinal channel, with its base at least partially as a sieve at the channel section over the trough (60). The channel is given a linear movement through a coupling to the first swing drive (40). The trough (60) has a round cross-section with the ramp (70) at an outer wall (62). The second swing drive (48) moves the trough (60) around its circumference in a circular motion. The channel penetrates through the side wall (62) of the trough. Both swing drives each have an electromagnetic drive action with separate swing components (40).

Device for treating dough pieces with a first conveyor (30, 
40, 50) for the dough pieces as well as with a second 

conveyor (48, 60, 70) for sugar, which second conveyor 
shows a trough (60) arranged under the first conveyor (30, 

40, 50) and extends upwardly ascending from the trough (60) 
over the first conveyor (30, 40, 50), characterized in that 

the second conveyor (48, 60, 70) shows a vibrating ramp 
(70) ascending from the trough (60). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
first conveyor shows a long extending channel (50) the 

bottom of which has at least partly the shape of a sieve 
along the portion of channel (54) extending over the 

trough. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the channel (50) is coupled with a 

first vibration drive (30, 40) which imparts a linear 
movement to the channel. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the trough (60) has a round cross 

section, the ramp (70) is realized on the exterior wall 
(62) of the trough and the second vibration drive (48) 

imparts a movement to the trough in about the direction of 
its circumference. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the channel (50) penetrates into the 

side wall (62) of the trough. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first and the second vibration 

drives are fitted on a common stand (10).  
 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first and the second vibration 

drive are respectively an electromagnetic vibration drive 
showing the different vibrating segments (30, 40, 50). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the ramp (70) shows several parallel 

paths (71, 73, 75, 77).
