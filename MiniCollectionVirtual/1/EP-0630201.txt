<ABSTRACT>
A food processor comprises a container (2) removably mounted on the processor body (1) and a lid (3) for the container (2). The lid (3) is secured on the container (2) by an upstanding member (13) on the body (1) over which a tubular aperture (7) extending up from the base of the container (2) is mounted such that the upstanding member (13) extends upwardly through the container (2). The upstanding member (13) engages with a central boss (16) depending from the underside of the lid (3) so that engagement of the lid (3) with the upstanding member (13) also serves to secure the container (2) on the body (1). The upstanding member (13) may comprise a fixed shaft around which is disposed a rotatable drive shaft (10, 21, 22) for rotatably driving a processing tool (5) within the container (2). The upstanding member (13) may also contain a safety interlock (18, 19) for preventing operation of the food processor without engagement of the lid (3) with the upstanding member (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a food processor and in 
particular to a food processor having a removable container 
with a lockable lid in which food can be prepared by, for 
example, chopping, slicing, blending, liquidising, grating, 
or shredding. A conventional food processor comprises a body, which 
contains a motor and drive gear mechanism and upon which 
user-operable controls are mounted. The body has an 
upstanding drive-shaft over which the container for 
retaining food to be processed and a food processing tool 
are mounted. The container is closed by a lid which 
interacts with a safety interlock in the processor body, 
thereby preventing the processor from being operated without 
the lid being secured on the container. In order to secure both the container to the body and 
the lid to the container, interlocking lugs and recesses are 
formed on the body and around the container base and around 
both the rim of the container and of the lid. Thus, when 
assembling the processor for use, it is necessary to ensure 
that all of the small lugs and recesses are interlocked 
which can be troublesome and time-consuming. Additionally, 
hygiene problems can arise due to the lugs and recesses 
forming dirt traps which are difficult to clean. 
Furthermore, the provision of such lugs and recesses during 
manufacture of the processor requires complex tooling and 
constrains the use of different size containers and 
materials from which the containers are made. CH-A-554139 discloses a mixer and dispenser of cold 
drinks or ice-cream comprising a container mounted on a body 
and having a lid. An upstanding rotatable drive shaft 
extends upwardly through the container and engages with a 
locking bar of a lock to secure the lid on the container. WO-A-8605658 discloses a kneading apparatus including 
a vat rotatable about a pivot on a frame, the vat having a 
pivotable cover containing a drive reduction unit and a  
 
drive output to which a beating tool can be attached. DE-U-8912794 discloses a food processor having ribs on 
the lid which engage with stop ribs on the container to 
secure the lid on the container. Projections on the 
container base engage in recesses of the housing on which 
the container is mounted. A conventional lid interlock and 
switch, with which a part of the lid engages, is mounted on 
a tower beside the container. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved food processor which substantially 
alleviates the aforementioned problems associated with known 
food

<CLAIMS>
A food processor comprising a food processing container 
(2) mounted on the body (1) of the food processor, a lid (3) 

for the container (2), and means (13) for securing the lid 
(3) on the container (2), said lid securing means (13) 

comprising an upstanding member (13) provided on said body 
(1) and over which said container (2) is mounted such that 

said upstanding member (13) extends upwardly through said 
container (2), characterised in that said container (2) is 

removably mounted on said body (1); in that said upstanding 

member (13) comprises a fixed shaft (13) around which is 
disposed a rotatable drive shaft (1) for rotatably driving 

a food processing tool (4) within the container; and in that 
said fixed shaft (13) engages with an underside portion (16) 

of said lid (3) when said lid (3) is positioned on said 
container (2) so as both to secure the lid (3) on the 

container (2) and to secure the container (2) on said body 
(1). 
A food processor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the lid 
(3) is provided with a central boss (16) depending from its 

underside, said boss (16) being arranged to engage with an 
upper end of said upstanding member (13) so as to secure the 

lid (3) and thus the container (2). 
A food processor as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the container (2) has a tubular aperture (7) extending from 

its base into its interior, which aperture (7) is disposed 
over the upstanding member (13) when the container (2) is 

mounted on said body (1). 
A food processor as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
two or more concentric drive shafts (21,22) are provided 

each for rotating a food processing tool (4) mounted thereon 
at a different speed.  

 
A food processor as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein a safety interlock (18,19) is provided which 

prevents operation of the food processor without said 
engagement of the lid (3) with the upstanding member (13). 
A food processor as claimed in claim 5, wherein the 
upstanding member (13) is substantially hollow and the 

safety interlock (18,19) comprises a switch mechanism (18) 
located within the upstanding member (13), the switch 

mechanism (18) being activated by the action of engaging the 
lid (3) with the upstanding member (13). 
A food processor as claimed in any preceding claim, 
including a stop member for inhibiting rotation of the 

container (2) relative to the body (1) and the lid (3). 
A food processor as claimed in any preceding claim, 
including an additional safety interlock to ensure that the 

processor cannot be operated without the container (2) as 
well as the lid (3) being in position on the body (1).
