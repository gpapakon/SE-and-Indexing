<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of this invention is a profile which has an open cross-section (2), in particular for plastic roller shutters, and comprises an individual part or a plurality of profile elements which are connected to one another by soft hinges (3), said profile (2) containing, on the outside and along its borders, a connecting means for connection to another corresponding profile (2). Said profile is characterised in that it is provided with a longitudinal reinforcement means (4).

<CLAIMS>
A profile (1, 2) with open cross-section, in particular for plastic roller
shutters, consisting either of a single piece (1) or of several profile

elements (2') connected to each other by means of soft hinges (3), the
profile (1, 2) having on the outside and along its edges a means for

connecting it to another corresponding profile (1, 2) and having also a
longitudinal reinforcing element (4), characterised in that the longitudinal

reinforcing elements (4) are fitted at regular intervals in the profiles (1) or
individual elements (2') of a profile (2) constituting the finished roller

shutter.
A profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is supported by retainers (5), preferably consisting

of ribs which run along the inside of the edge strips (6) of the profile (1)
or profile element (2') close to the inner wall of the profile (1) or profile

element (2'), and which, together with the inner wall, delimit the slots (7)
into which the edges of the longitudinal reinforcing profile (4) are

inserted.
A profile according to Claim 2, characterised in that the gap between the
inner wall of the profile (1) or profile element (2') and the rib which forms

the retainer (5) for the longitudinal reinforcing profile (4) is preferably
either the same size as or slightly wider than the thickness of the edges

of the longitudinal reinforcing profile (4).
A profile according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is a metal profile of low deformability. 
A profile according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the profile (1)
or profile element (2') preferably has a press-on runner fitted to at least

one of its ends.
A profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is made of a deformable, flexible material.
A profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is made of profiled sheet metal.
A profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is made of sheet metal with good bending

properties.
A profile according to Claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is an injection moulded profile.
A profile according to Claim 2, characterised in that the retainers (5) for
the longitudinal reinforcing profile (4) consist of long edges which run

along the ends of the edge strips (6) of the profile (1) or profile element
(2') and are bent inwards into the open space.
A profile according to Claim 10, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) has a U-shaped, square, rectangular or trapezoidal

cross-section, with the free ends of the arms of the U-section resting on
each edge or with the outside resting on both edges.
A profile according to Claims 2 and 3, characterised in that the retainer
(5) for the longitudinal reinforcing profile (4) consists of a slot running

along one edge of the profile (1) or profile element (2') close to the inner
wall, and a retainer edge running along the free end on the other edge.
A profile according to Claim 12, characterised in that the longitudinal
reinforcing profile (4) is an angled profile.
