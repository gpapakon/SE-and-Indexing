A programmable portable infusion pump system 
designed for automatically injecting a medicinal substance 

to a patient, comprising an infusion tube connected to the 
body of the patient, a first assembly composed of a first 

supply chamber (14) containing the medicinal substance and 
a first pump-unit (12) comprising a motor and a pump driven 

by the motor and designed for injecting the medicinal 
substance from the supply chamber into the infusion tube, 

and a programmable controller (10) designed to control the 
motor, said assembly being detachable from said controller 

even though remaining under its control;
 
   said system being characterised in that said 

controller has a reduced size in order to be permanently 
worn by the patient, which makes the system ambulatory, 

said controller including a microprocessor, a keyboard (16) 
and a screen (18), and said microprocessor being directly 

programmed on the patient thru the keyboard to control the 
operation of the motor according to a predetermined 

infusion program and providing information regarding the 
infusion process thru displaying on the screen. 
The system according to claim 1, characterised in 
that it further comprises at least a second assembly 

including a second pump-unit (42) and a second supply 
chamber (44), connected to said controller (10), said 

second assembly being detachable from said controller with 
said second pump-unit remaining under the control of said 

controller, so that the controller can control several 
simultaneous infusions. 
The system according to claim 2, characterised in 
that each one of said assemblies is detachable from said 

controller (10) even though connected to said controller 
thru a cable (40) supplying power to the motor of said 

assembly, control transmission and data transfer. 
The system according to claim 2, characterised in 
that at least one of said assemblies comprises a battery  

 
for powering the motor, and said controller (10) comprises 

a remote control device so that at least one of said 
assemblies can be detached from said controller and 

remotely controlled by the latter thru said remote control 
device. 
The system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that said controller (10) is programmable 

relative to absolute time so as to provide a chronotherapy 
adjustable to the biological pace of the patient. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said controller (10) 

comprises a memory for storing the history of each ongoing 
infusion. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said controller (10) 

comprises a memory to record prior to any infusion control 
parameters related to the patient, and to modify the 

commands provided by said controller (10) when one of said 
parameters is not met during an infusion. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the portion of the infusion 

tube located in each of said pump-units is equipped with a 
pressure sensor (102, 104) designed for providing said 

controller (10) with the measuring of the pressure within 
the portion of the infusion tube under pressure from the 

pump. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that sensors placed in or on the 

patient's body transmit to said controller (10) 
physiological data so that the latter can program the 

infusion parameters according to the received data. 
The system according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that said controller (10) comprises a bar 

code reading device so as to be programmed by means of an 
optical pen. 
The system according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that said controller (10) comprises an  

 
electronic card reader so as to be programmed by means of 

an electronic card. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said controller (10) can be 

connected to a personal computer so as to store data 
recorded in the memory of said controller for statistics 

purpose, and also so as to program said controller. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said controller (10) is 

equipped with a modem so as to be connected to the 
telephone network so that a doctor or qualified 

organisation can collect data recorded in the memory of 
said controller and thus remotely monitor the treatment. 
The system according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said supply chamber can be 

thrown away and is connected in a removable fashion to said 
pump-unit (12), thru an elastic clipping mechanism (50, 

52).
