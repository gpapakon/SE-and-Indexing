<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for
preparing β-lactam derivatives, which are a useful
antibiotic, having the formula (I):

wherein R1 represents hydrogen or a metal salt; and R2
represents hydrogen, acetoxy methyl, (2,5-dihydro-2-methyl-6-hydroxy-5-oxo-as-triazin-3-yl)thiomethyl
or (1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl.Hitherto, a number of processes for the preparation
of semi-synthesized β-lactam antibiotic materials have
been proposed.For instance, it is well known that an acylated
compound of the formula (I) above can be prepared by
converting an amino-protected organic acid of the formula
(II):
 
wherein R3 is an amino-protecting group, into its
activated derivatives, and then by acylating 7-ADCA (7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic
acid), 7-ACA (7-aminocephalosporanic
acid) or its derivatives with the activated
derivatives.The activated derivatives of the compound of the
formula (II) may include an acid chloride, an acid
anhydride, an activated ester, an activated amide, an
activated amide solvate, and so forth.In order to use an acid chloride as the activated
derivative, the organic acid (II) is reacted with thionyl
chloride (SOCl2), phosphorous trichloride (PCl3),
phosphorous pentachloride (PCl5), or phosphorous
oxychloride (POCl3). The resulting acid chloride is
acylated with 7-ADCA, 7-ACA or its derivatives followed by
removing the protecting R3 group to give a compound of the
formula (I): see Japanese Patent Application Kokai No.
52-102,096; 53-34,795; 53-68,796; 54-52,096 ; and 54-157,596;
as well as British Patent No. 2,025,933.However, the process mentioned above must be carried
out under severe and complicated reaction conditions,
because the process is subject to protection and
deprotection of the amino group in the organic acid. This
process further suffers from the defect that the acid
chloride is unstable.In another method, 2-pyridinethioester, 2-benzothiazole
ester, or 1-hydroxy benzotriazole ester is
synthesized from an organic acid of the formula (III): 

and then the resulting ester is acylated with 7-ADCA, 7-ACA
or its derivatives to give a compound of the formula
(I): see Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 52-102,293;
54-95,593; and 56-152,488.However, this process shows relatively low yields due
to a side reaction accompanied when preparing the
activated esters. And the process must be carried out at
a high reaction temperature for a long period of reaction
time during the acylation step, and requires a step of
removing the by-products resulted from the
