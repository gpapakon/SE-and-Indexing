<ABSTRACT>
A quinoline-3-acetic acid derivative represented by general formula (I) or a medicinally acceptable salt thereof, 
wherein R¹, R² and R³ may be the same or different from one another and each represents hydrogen or halogen; R⁴ 

represents hydrogen, halogen or (un)substituted lower alkyl: R⁵ represents optionally esterified carboxyl; and the 
broken line represents an optional presence of a double bond. The compound (I) and the salt have an aldose reductase 

inhibitor activity against mammals including man and are excellent in safety, and hence are useful as the drug for 
the therapeutic treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as faulty union of corneal injury, cataract, neurosis, 

retinopathy and nephropathy, in particular, cataract and neurosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel quinoline-3-acetic
acid derivative having a superior aldose reductase inhibitory
activity, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a process
for the production thereof and a pharmaceutical agent
containing said compound.The compounds of the present invention mentioned above
(which include the above-mentioned derivative and a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, hereinafter the same)
are useful as aldose reductase inhibitors and for the prevention
and/or treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as
faulty union of corneal injury, diabetic cataract, retinopathy,
nephropathy and neurosis.For treating diabetes, blood sugar regulators such as
insulin and synthetic hypoglycemic agents have been
conventionally used widely. Diabetes is a disease which
accompanies various complications which are hardly prevented
from developing by a mere control of the blood sugar, and a new
therapeutic agent for the complications of diabetes has been
demanded. Accumulation of and increase in sorbitol and
galactitol in tissues which are caused by chronic hyperglycemia
have recently been drawing attention as the mechanism of the 
onset of the complications of diabetes.Some literatures suggest that a compound having an
inhibitory action on the activity of aldose reductase, which is
an enzyme capable of converting aldose such as glucose or
galactose into sorbitol or galactitol, is useful for the
treatment of the complications of diabetes, such as faulty
union of corneal injury, cataract, neurosis, nephropathy and
retinopathy [see J.H. Kinoshita et al., Biochem. Biophys, Acta,
158, 472 (1968), Richard Poulson et al. Biochem. Pharmacol.,
32, 1495 (1983) and D. Dvornik et al., Science, 182, 1145
(1973)].Based on the foregoing, the study is directed to the
prevention and treatment of the complications of diabetes by the
inhibition of aldose reductase activity to ultimately inhibit
accumulation of polyols such as sorbitol and galactitol.Of the compounds synthesized for this end, various 1,4-benzothiazine-4-acetic
acid derivatives have aldose reductase
inhibitory action as reported in Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication Nos. 40264/1986 and 107970/1988. Yet, the
development of a therapeutic agent for the complications of
diabetes, which has a still more excellent aldose reductase
inhibitory action, is desired.In view of the above, the present inventors have conducted
intensive studies with the aim of developing a therapeutic agent
for the complications of diabetes, which has an
