<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recommended route guide apparatus for moving a 
vehicle from a certain point to a different point efficiently by automatically selecting and 
guiding a recommended route between the points. From "Motorola Technical Developments", volume 13, July 1991, Shaumburg, Illinois, 
USA, page 58 to 59, a route planning system with user selectable preferences is known, 
which uses various algorithms to traverse a digital representation of the road network 
between two points to determine the lowest cost route between those two points. The 
route planning algorithm is able to specify a particular road segment, road way or area 
that one prefers to use and that should be included in the route, even if this results in a 
more costly route. From Japanese Hei 5-6238, a system of the aforementioned kind is known, in which as 
location setting means, a principal intersection closest in distance to the point set by the 
user is determined as departure point or destination point. or the user may select among 
plural candidate points. However, if the search start point or the search end point is merely set at an inter section 
closest in distance to the departure point or destination point, there is a possibility that a 
route may be deduced from a point to a point not intended by the user. Such an example 
is shown in Figure 15(a) as a diagram showing in the example (destination side) of road 
network in which a desired route  
 
cannot be obtained in conventional location setting method, 
and Fig. 15(b) is a diagram showing an example of selected 
route determined by the conventional location setting 
method. In Fig. 15(a), the departure point is in the 
direction of P(S), and the user desires to go to the point 
indicated by shaded area and set the location at point P(U). 
At this time, the distances from point P(U) to intersections 
N0, N1, N2 are supposed to be in the following relation. 
P(U)-N0 distance < P(U)-N2 distance < P(U)-N1 distance In these conditions, supposing the search end point to 
be the intersection closest to the point P(U), the 
intersection N0 is selected as the search end point, and the 
route is selected as shown in Fig. 15(b). It means a 
possibility of selecting a route for passing over the front 
side of the destination point and guiding to the back side. 
Besides, aside from setting the location, in the method of 
letting the user select one intersection from plural 
candidate intersections, the user may not be always familiar 
with the geometry of the input

road network recording means (101) for recording positions 
and connection relation of intersections and roads, 
location setting means (102) for setting a departure point 
and a destination point, 
search start point and search end point setting means (103) for selecting 
a plurality of search start points or search end points lying within 

a specific range on a map on the basis of the 
departure point or destination point set by the location 

setting means, 
search means (104) for searching a plurality of routes from the selected plurality of 
search start points upto the selected plurality of search end points or vice versa, said 

search being performed with the information in the road network recording means 
according to a specific rule, 
and selecting a recommended route from said plurality of routes on the basis of a 
predetermined criterion, and 
output means (105) for putting out a route obtained by the 
search means. 
A recommended route guide apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein 


the search start point and search end point setting means (103) is 
characterized by adding an initial cost upon start of 

search or an additional cost upon reaching the search end  
 

point by a function relating to a distance between each 
selected intersection point and the departure point or the 

destination point. 
A recommended route guide apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein 


the search start point and search end point setting means (103) selects 
one or more road links close to the locations defined by position information 

of the departure point and destination point respectively ,
