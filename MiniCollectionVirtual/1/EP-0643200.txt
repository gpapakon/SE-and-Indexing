<ABSTRACT>
Cam shaft for controlling the opening of the valves of an internal combustion engine, comprising an inner shaft (3) and a hollow outer shaft (1) which is designed to be mounted so that it can rotate in fixed bearings of the engine, the said outer shaft concentrically accommodating the previous one and allowing relative angular position variations, each of the said shafts (1,3) supporting a group of cams (4,6) with which they are integral in terms of rotation, characterised in that at least one of the cams (4,6) integral with the said inner shaft (3) is carried by a sleeve (2) mounted so that it can glide along the outer shaft (1), the said sleeve (2) close to the said cam also having a bearing surface (5) intended to be mounted so that it can rotate in a fixed bearing of the engine.
