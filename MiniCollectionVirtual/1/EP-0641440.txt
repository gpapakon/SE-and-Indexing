<ABSTRACT>
Immunoassay methods and reagents for the quantification of total doxepins (i.e., E-doxepin, Z-doxepin, E-desmethyldoxepin, and Z-desmethyldoxepin) in a test sample are disclosed. The quantification of total doxepins is accomplished in an immunoassay employing antibodies and labeled reagents prepared with doxepin derivatives of formula (II), wherein Y-Z can be C=CH or N-CH2, R1 is a linking group, R2 can be H or CH3 and Q can be a detectable moiety or an immunogenic carrier material. The antibody reagent comprises antibodies which are capable of binding to total doxepins and which are produced with one or more immunogens prepared from the doxepin derivative of formula (II), and the labeled reagent is also prepared from the doxepin derivative of formula (II).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the immunoassay
determination of doxepins in a test sample. In particular, the
present invention relates to immunogens, antisera prepared
from such immunogens, and labeled reagents for the
quantification of total doxepins in a test sample, preferably
for use in a fluorescence polarization immunoassayThe monitoring of therapeutic drug levels in biological
fluids such as serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, and the like,
has become very useful to provide physicians with
information to aid in patient management. The monitoring of
such drug levels enables adjustment of patient dosage to
achieve optimal therapeutic effects, and helps avoid either
subtherapeutic or toxic levels. Doxepin is a tricyclic
antidepressant drug which exists in two isomeric forms, E-doxepin
(Formula IA, R=CH3) and Z-doxepin (Formula IB,
R=CH3):
Although doxepin has been found to be very effective in
treating chronic depression, its concentration in a patient's
blood must be maintained in a therapeutic range. A wide
interpatient variation normally exists in human plasma for a
given dose. However, high doses have been associated with
central nervous system disorders, toxicity, hypertension,
seizures, coma and death. Since individuals vary greatly in
their response to doxepin, it is necessary to monitor the
therapy by measuring the level thereof in, for example, the
serum or plasma of the patient.Doxepin is administered as a mixture of the E-doxepin
and Z-doxepin isomers, also referred to as trans-doxepin and
cis-doxepin, respectively, at a ratio of about 85:15 (E:Z). Once
administered, doxepin is metabolized by N-demethylation to
form desmethyldoxepin, which is also active and which also
occurs as both the E and Z isomers thereof (Formulae IA and
IB, R=H). For des-methyldoxepin, varying ratios of the
isomers have been reported in individual patients.Since both doxepin (E-isomer and Z-isomer) and
desmethyl-doxepin (E-isomer and Z-isomer) are active for
treating depressive symptoms, conventional diagnostic
techniques for the determination of doxepin levels is based on
the measurement of the levels of the respective isomers of
doxepin and desmethyldoxepin wherein the therapeutic range
ascribed to blood levels in a patient is the total of doxepins
and desmethyldoxepins, i.e. E-doxepin plus Z-doxepin plus E-desmethyldoxepin
plus Z-desmethyldoxepin equals total
doxepins. Concentrations below the range are proposed to be
subtherapeutic for the treatment of depression, while levels
higher than the range can be
