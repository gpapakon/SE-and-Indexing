workpieces (1) by means of a coating 

powder, particularly a lacquer powder, in which 
the cleaned and/or surface-treated workpiece (1)

(1) is moved relative to the inductor (2) and to 
the spray device (3), or the inductor (2) and the 

spray device (3) are moved relative to the 
workpiece (1), characterized in that the 

inductively heated region of the workpiece (1) 
disposed immediately behind the inductor (2), 

viewed in the direction of advance, is sprayed 
with the coating powder so that the coating takes 

place outside the induction region with a delay 
after the heating. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the spraying of the coating 

powder starts after a preceding heating phase by 
means of the inductor (2) and is then continued 

synchronously with the heating.

elongate element, preferably a pipe, characterized 
in that, during the inductive heating and 

spraying, the workpiece (1) is preferably set in 
rotary motion about its longitudinal axis by means 

of a clamping device (5). 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, in which the workpiece is a pipe (1), 

characterized in that the induction heating of the 
pipe wall is designed, particularly by means of

wall, and in that the pipe (1) is also sprayed and 
coated from the inside by means of a further spray 

device (8) 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the pipe (1) can be 

heated by respective inductors (2) and is sprayed 
and coated by means of a spray device (3, 8), both 

from the outside and from the inside, preferably 
simultaneously. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the coating thickness 

to be achieved is controlled by the speed of  
 

advance of the inductor (2) and of the spray 
device (3, 8) and/or by the speed of rotation of 

the workpiece (1) and/or by the heating-up rate. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the surface of the 

workpiece (1) already sprayed with coating powder 
is heated again by the inductor (2) so that the at 

least partially melted-on coating powder can 
flatten out on the surface in the molten or 

softened condition owing to its specific surface 
tension. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 7, cha
racterized in that the powder particles 
sprayed and not melted onto the workpiece (1) are 

exhausted by means of a suction device (12, 13), 
and in that the powder particles exhausted are 

optionally supplied to the spray device (3, 8) 
again for further spraying. 
Device for the powder-coating of 
electrically-conductive workpieces (1) by means of 

a coating powder, particularly a lacquer powder, 
in which an inductor (2) is provided for the 

inductive heating of the workpiece (1) and at 
least one spray device (3) is provided for 

spraying the heated workpiece (1) with the coating  
 

powder, and in which, during the inductive heating 
and spraying, the workpiece (1) is movable 

relative to the inductor (2) and to the spray 
device (3) or the inductor (2) and the spray 

device (3) are movable relative to the workpiece 
(1),
 
characterized in that the spray device (3, 8) is 

disposed downstream of the inductor (2), viewed in 
the direction of advance, so that the inductively 

heated region of the workpiece (1) disposed behind 
the inductor can be sprayed with the coating 

powder, and so that the coating takes place 
outside the induction region with a delay after 

the heating. 
Device according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the inductor (2) is 

connected to an inverter (4) and can be acted on 
by an alternating current of variable frequency, 

the frequency of the inductor (2) being 
adjustable, preferably continuously, in order to 

influence the depth of penetration of the eddy 
currents induced in the workpiece (1) by the 

inductor (2). 
Device according to Claim 9 or Claim 10, 
in which the workpiece (1) is elongate, preferably  

 
in the form of a pipe, characterized in that the 

inductor (2) extends at least partially around the

clearance, and is approximately semicircular, or 
extends around the pipe (1) in the form of a ring 

and, optionally, is formed in two parts or in the 
form of pincers. 
Device according to any one of Claims 9 
to 11, characterized in that a clamping device (5) 

preferably having two seats (6, 7) is provided for 
the workpiece (1), in that the clamping device (5)
