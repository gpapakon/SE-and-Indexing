<ABSTRACT>
A toy vehicle and track assembly (10) 
including a flexible elongate track (12) having 

electrical conductors (32) affixed thereto, a vehicle 
(14) which is configured for the insertion of the track 

(12) therethrough, the vehicle (14) having an electric 
motor (40) for pro propulsion along the track (14), a 

track storage unit (18) affixed to one end of the track 
(12) and having a winding mechanism (22) for compact 

storage thereof, and an electrical controller (16) at 
the other end of the track (12) providing a storage 

battery-type power source and selective controls for 
selectively operating the vehicle (14) along the track 

(12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to self-propelled 
toy vehicle and track assemblies and more 
particularly to a self-propelled toy vehicle with a 
flexible track which passes through the vehicle for 
controlled vehicle travel therealong. Toy vehicle and track assemblies in which a 
toy vehicle moves along a continuous track are well 
known. The prior art tracks are usually formed of 
rigid track sections which limit variation of the track 
orientation and configuration. In some situations 
where the track turns upside down, loops or climbs 
sharply upward, gravity takes over and the car may not 
stay on the track. Further, most current toy vehicle 
arid track assemblies are limited to automobiles, trucks, 
or other essentially land-based vehicles. The 
vehicles could be configured as airplanes or space 
craft, yet even the most vivid imaginations would find 
difficulty with an airplane or a space craft on which is 
essentially a scale model roadway. It is accordingly an object of the present 
invention to provide a toy vehicle and track assembly 
wherein the driving mechanism of the vehicle remains in 
contact with the track even when the track curves 
sharply upwardly or is upside down. It is another 
object of the present invention to provide a toy vehicle 
and track assembly having a flexible track which may be  
 
operated in a variety of different configurations. 
It is still another object of the present invention to 
provide a track assembly which may be selectively 
mountable to a variety of supporting objects and is 
operable when spaced a distance above the ground thereby 
giving added realism to space craft or airplane-like 
vehicles. The present invention will now be described 
by way of example with reference to the annexed 
drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a toy vehicle 
and track assembly according to the preferred embodiment 
of the present invention; Fig. 1A is a perspective view of an alternate 
form of the toy vehicle and track assembly; Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a flat 
track according to the present invention; Fig. 2A is a cross-sectional view of a 
round track according to the present invention; Fig. 2B is a cross-sectional view of a 
polygonal track according to the present invention; Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing a short 
tunnel suspended by a vacuum mount and a chain; Fig. 4 is a top plan view of the vehicle of 
the present invention mounted to the flat track, with 
the vehicle body broken away to illustrate the operative 
components within the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A toy vehicle and track assembly 
comprising: 

   track means formed as an elongate flexible 
member of a predetermined length having flexible 

electrical conducting means along the longitudinal 
extend thereof; 

   an electric power source; 
   vehicle means having a lengthwise opening 

configured to receive therethrough said track means, an 
electric motor, means for connecting said electric motor 

to said conducting means for communication with said 
electric power source, and drive means driven by said 

electric motor and disposed for engagement with said 
track means for propelling said vehicle means 

therealong; 
   tunnel means suspended around said track 

means through which said vehicle means passes; 
   track storage means located at one end of 

said track means for storage and payout of any 
predetermined length of said track means; and 

   control means for selectively connecting and 
disconnecting said electric power source with said 

conducting means. 
A toy vehicle and track assembly according 
to claim 1 wherein said track means defines a plurality 

of longitudinal slots extending substantially the full 
 

longitudinal extent of said track means and said 
electrical conducting means includes a plurality of 

flexible electrically conductive strips disposed within 
said slots. 
A toy vehicle and track assembly according 
to claim 1 wherein said track means comprises an 

elongate track bed in a substantially circular cross 
section with a flexible aluminum tube extended at the 

center through its length. 
A toy vehicle and track assembly according 
to claim 2 wherein said vehicle means includes an 

electrically operable auxiliary system and said 
electrical conducting means includes three electrically 

conductive strips disposed within said slots, two of 
said strips being of positive polarity and one of said 

strips being of negative polarity, one said strip of 
positive polarity and said strip of negative polarity 

being for said electric motor operation and one said 
strip of positive polarity and said strip of negative 

polarity being for operation of said auxiliary system, 
said auxiliary system including a plurality of lights 

affixed to said vehicle means, said lights being 
selectively illuminable using said switching means. 
A toy vehicle and track assembly 
 

according to claim 1 wherein said tunnel means includes 
at least one bugle-shaped tubular member suspended 

around said track means, and at least one suspension 
chain to suspend each bugle-shaped tubular member around 

said track means, each suspension chain having one end 
fixed with a vacuum mount or hanger for fastening to a 

support and an opposite end connected to either bugle-shaped 
tubular member by an S-shaped hook.
