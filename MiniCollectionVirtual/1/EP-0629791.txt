<ABSTRACT>
A fluid mount 
(20)
 provides a flexible connection and fluid effects 
such as damping and/or fluid inertia for a supported member 
(22)
 attached to 
a supporting member 
(24)
 in a singular and unitary package. The fluid 
mount 
(20)
 includes a beam 
(34)
 and a laminated elastomer and shim 
construction bonded thereto, defining variable volume fluid chambers 
(44, 46, 
48, 50)
 and interconnecting fluid passageways 
(52, 54).
 Fluid effects are 
provided in both a radial translational mode (loading at 
R
) and a rotational 
mode (loading at 
T
) to suppress vibrations of the supported member 
(22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the area of mounts for attaching a supported 
member to a supporting member. Specifically, the invention relates to the 
area of fluid and elastomer mounts for providing vibration attenuation of the 
vibration emanating from a supported member. Fluid mounts for attachment between a supporting member and a 
supported member are taught in US Patent 4,811,919 to Jones, the disclosure 
of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In Jones '919, the fluid inertia 
within the mount can be tuned to provide amplified counter inertial forces 
that coincide with an operating frequency of a vibrating aircraft engine. 
However, in order to produce these fluid forces the beam 11 of mount must 
be loaded in a particular direction such that fluid is transferred from chamber 
40 to chamber 41 through tube 45. This can only be accomplished by 
translation of stub shaft 10 toward frame 20 in a vertical direction thus urging 
fluid to flow through tube 45. Torsional or cocking rotation of the Jones '919 
mount will not set the fluid in motion through tube 45 and hence, no 
damping or inertial effects will be obtained. US Patent 2,705,118 to Beck, the disclosure of which is also hereby 
incorporated by reference, discloses a mounting arrangement that 
incorporates fluid damping in either a torsional mode or a vertical mode, 
depending on the orientation of the mounts, but not in both orientations at 
once. Beck '118 describes a fluid torque restraint in Fig. 4, wherein mounts 
are located on opposite sides of the torque axis of gear box 17. When torque is 
applied, fluid 6 in chambers 5 and conduits 9 are placed in compression. This 
provides a high degree of torque restraint, i.e., a high torsional stiffness. 
However, when the gear box 17 is subjected to vertical translational loads, 
fluid is free to flow through conduit 9 and valve 10, thus providing damping 
and a soft translational stiffness. In the Fig. 3 embodiment, contrarily, the 
mount arrangement imparts a high vertical stiffness yet provides a low 
rotational or torsional stiffness. When the engine 11 is subjected to rotational 
or torsional loading, fluid is free to flow through conduit 9 and valves 10, 
thus providing fluid damping and a low torsional stiffness. However, the  
 
Beck '118 device cannot provide damping in both the vertical 
and rotational modes simultaneously. Further, the mounts in 
Beck must be spaced on opposite sides of the torque axis of 
the supported body. US Patent 4,881,712 to Lun discloses an engine mount
