<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing aromatic isothiocyanate
derivatives.Aromatic isothiocyanate derivatives are useful compounds as the intermediates
for the production of agricultural chemicals. For the production of an isothiocyanate
derivative from an amine derivative, various processes have been known in which, for
example, (1) an amine derivative is reacted with thiophosgene (see, e.g., Shin-jikken
Kagaku Koza, vol. 14 (III), pp. 1503-1509 (1978), published from Maruzen); (2) an
amine derivative such as aniline, bromoaniline or methoxyaniline is reacted with carbon
disulfide in the presence of a base using a solvent such as toluene or ether, and then
reacted with a chlorinated oxidizing agent (see, e.g., J. Org. Chem.,29, 3098 (1964));
or (3) an aniline derivative such as 4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-methoxycarbonylmethylthioaniline
is reacted with carbon disulfide in the presence of a fused-ring compound such as
1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane using a solvent such as toluene or dichloromethane, and
then reacted with a chlorinated oxidizing agent (see, e.g., WO 92/13835).However, the process (1) has a disadvantage that it is necessary to use
thiophosgene which is expensive and not readily available. The process (2) has a
disadvantage that when 6-amino-7-fluoro-4-(2-propynyl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one
or 4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-(2-propynyl)oxyaniline, each of which is an amine derivative in
the present invention, is used as the amine derivative, the corresponding isothiocyanate
derivative can be obtained only in significantly decreased yield. Further, the process (3)
requires the use of a particular fused-ring compound, and it cannot be said that this
process has high efficiency from an industrial point of view.GB-A-985 297 discloses a process for preparing aromatic diisothiocyanates
wherein an alkali metal chlorite is used as oxidizing agent.
GB-A-1024913 discloses a process for the production of organic
isothiocyanates wherein chloramine-T is used as oxidizing agent.Accordingly, there has been a great demand for developing a process for
producing isothiocyanate derivatives in high yield without using thiophosgene, which is 
expensive and not readily available, or without using any particular fused-ring compound.This object could be achieved on the
basis of the finding that isothiocyanate derivatives can be produced from the
corresponding amine derivatives in high yield in the presence of a conventional base in a
nitrogen-containing polar solvent.Thus, the present invention provides a
