<ABSTRACT>
A step switch for a step transformer (1), preferably for a cast-resin encapsulated step transformer, has one-phase identical step switch modules (3.1, 3.2, 3.3) having each all means required for switching the load and its own housing for enclosing said means. The step switch modules are linked each by a driving shaft (4.1, 4.2, 4.3) to a motor drive (5). Each step switch module is directly arranged with no connecting lines on the output lines of a step winding or is connected thereto over a connecting terminal (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) and has fastening elements having the same geometrical configuration, as well as electric connecting elements (3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3) which are electrically connected with the step contacts to be wired inside the housing or which extend themselves into the inside of the housing through a recess (3.4) in the housing and directly form the wirable step contacts.

Tap selector switch according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
thereby, that the mechanical fastening means (3.1.2, 3.2.2, 3.3.2,; 

7.2.1 to 7.2.5) as well as also the electrical fastening elements

substantially parallel cover plates (14.1, 14.2), which are in turn 
connected with these housing parts as well as of at least two horizontal 

guide pins (15), which are disposed between the cover plates (14.1, 
14.2) and fix them in their position at that side of the housing, which 

is remote from the shaped parts (11), that at least one guide rail 
(17.1, 17.2), at least one cam rail (16.1, 16.2) and at least one output 

rail (18) are disposed vertically between the guide pins (15), that a
