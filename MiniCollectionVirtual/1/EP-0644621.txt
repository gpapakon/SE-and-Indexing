<ABSTRACT>
A rubber plug (3) for a water-proof connector has an 
inner cylinder (11) and an outer cylinder (16). 

The rubber plug (3) into 
which an electrical wire (2) inserted and which is inserted into 

a cylindrical structure (1) of the water-proof connector 
sealingly closes the gap between the electrical wire (2) and the 

cylindrical structure (1). The inner cylinder (11) is provided at a 
portion which is positioned near the opening of the 

cylindrical structure (1) of the water-proof connector, for 
sealingly closing a gap between the electrical wire (2) and 

the inner cylinder (11). And the outer cylinder (16) has an annular 
groove (14), and is provided outside the inner cylinder (11) at the 

portion in such a manner that said outer cylinder (16) surrounds 
said inner cylinder (11) through the annular groove (14) for closing a 

gap between the inner cylindrical surface of the cylindrical 
structure (1) and the outer cylinder (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plug for a water-proof
connector which sealingly closes the gap which may be
formed between the connector housing and an electrical wire
inserted into it.A conventional rubber plug of this type is as shown
in FIG. 6. That is, the rubber plug 50 comprises: a
cylindrical plug body 51 which is fitted on an electrical
wire; a plurality of outer annular lips 52 formed on the
outer cylindrical surface of the cylindrical plug body 51;
and a plurality of inner annular lips 53 formed on the inner
cylindrical surface of the cylindrical plug body 51. The
rubber plug 50 is inserted into the cavity 56 of a connector
housing 55 from the right in FIG. 6 in such a manner that the
outer annular lips 52 are sealingly pressed against the inner
cylindrical surface of the connector housing 55 while the
inner annular lips 53 are also sealingly pressed against the
outer cylindrical surface of the electrical wire 54.However, the above-described conventional rubber plug
suffers from the following difficulty: When, as shown in
FIG. 7, a force acts on the electrical wire 54 at the end of
the cavity 56; i.e., at the opening of the connector housing 
55, to bend the electrical wire 54 laterally of the
latter 55 depending on the wiring arrangement, the wall of
the rubber plug 50 is compressed by the electrical wire 54
on the side to which the latter 54 is bent, thus forming a
gap between the inner cylindrical surface of the cavity 56
and the rubber plug 50, and a gap between the electrical
wire 54 and the rubber plug 50. As a result, the connector
is no longer water-proof; that is, water may enter the
cavity 56.WO-A-86/06883 discloses a water-proof connector
construction having a cylindrical housing structure into
which an electrical conductor is inserted. An elastomeric
plug serves for sealing the cylindrical space between the
bore of the housing structure and the connector. This plug
is provided with an annular groove in a plug section
located fully inside the cylindrical housing structure so
that the opening of the cylindrical housing structure, at
the region of entrance of the electrical conductor, is
continuously closed by the plug. Thus, the ground of the
groove just mentioned is located near the opening of the
cylindrical structure and the groove extends axially in
direction to the inner of the cylindrical housing
structure.It is an object of the present invention to provide a plug for a
water-proof connector of the kind comprising the features
defined in claim 1 and having a good water-tightness

<CLAIMS>
A rubber plug for making a water-proof connection between a cylinder and an
electrical wire (2), whereby said plug is elongate and in use sealingly closes the

gap between the electrical wire which passes therethrough and the cylinder, said
plug comprising adjacent a rear end portion thereof an inner substantially

cylindrical sleeve (11), an outer sleeve (16, 16a, 16b) extending from an
intermediate portion of the plug towards a rear end thereof, and an annular or

part-annular groove (14, 14a, 14b, 31a) therebetween, so that if a bending force is
applied to the wire it is not substantially transmitted to the outer sleeve,

wherein

said plug (3) is insertable into said cylinder with its front end leading so that a mid
portion of the plug presses against the inner surface of the cylinder and the outer

sleeve presses against a rear end portion of the cylinder. 
Plug according to claim 1, wherein said outer sleeve has an
outer taper surface (26) which increases gradually in

diameter in the rearward direction,
said said taper surface (26) being

pressed against the edge (1a) of the opening of the
cylinder (1).
Plug according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said part-annular
groove comprises a plurality of divisional grooves

(31a).
