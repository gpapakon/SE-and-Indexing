<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of extrudates from renewable raw materials using biopolymeric and mineral raw materials. The object of the invention is to provide a process of the generic type by means of which it is possible to inhibit the properties of the biopolymeric supports, in particular their solubility, by adding components and to produce solid, water- and heat-resistant articles having suitable prerequisites for use in the further-processing industry. The object is achieved according to the invention by mixing the biopolymeric raw materials, in the form of cereal, such as wheat, rye, maize, triticale, rice, barley and buckwheat, oilseed extraction waste, such as rape seed, cotton seed, soya, sunflower and linseed extraction waste, animal wool, such as sheep's wool, vegetable fibres, such as cotton and flax, sawdust, China grass, straw and dried grass, and mineral additives, such as limestone flour, lime hydrate, Portland cement, marl, clay flour, perlite, kieselguhr, glass and gypsum, with a separately added hydrophobicising agent, and subsequently processing the mixture in an extruder.
