<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for qualitative and quantitative determination of substances in a liquid medium by crossblow (tangential) filtration. The filtration method is characterised in that use is made of a membrane (4) which is made specific by immobilising at least one specific ligand of each of the desired substances, the liquid medium (5) is caused to flow at high speed tangentially to the surface of the membrane, and a slight overpressure is maintained above the filtration membrane. The device comprises a detection and/or measurement cell (16), means (19) for circulating liquids and sealing means. The cell comprises at least one enclosure, each enclosure having an internal space for passage of the liquid and a perforated support (3) carrying the micropore membrane (4, 8) on which ligands are immobilised.
