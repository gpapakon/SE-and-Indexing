<ABSTRACT>
There is proposed a power converter circuit for the supply of an intermediate DC voltage circuit for a DC load, in particular a pulse-controlled invertor, via a DC chopper, a first (CFO) and a second input capacitance element (CFU) being connected in series between the positive mains connection (1) and the negative mains connection (2). A chopper inductor (LST) and the positive DC connection of the DC load (WR) are connected to the junction (B) of the two capacitances, and the chopper inductor is connected on the other side, via a first semiconductor switch (G1), which can be turned off automatically, to the first input capacitance element and, via a second diode (D2), to the second input capacitance element, to which the negative DC connection of the invertor is also connected.
