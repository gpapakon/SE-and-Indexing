<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes a motion generating system for 
simulator having a multi-tier assembly of jacks. The multi-tier jacks permit 

the platform and equipment on it to move freely and safely in six degrees of 
freedom and to a maximum extent permitted by the mechanical properties of 

the jacks and the joints. In the preferred embodiment of the present 
invention, a two-tier assembly of jacks connects the floor and the platform of 

a simulator for extending the maximum range in movement of platform and 
equipment on it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to motion system for simulator, and in 
particular, to a multi-tier jack motion system for simulating the motion cues in 
flight or vessel simulators and more recently in similar equipments used in 
theme/amusement park or sports/entertainment industry. Simulators are well known in the art for training aircraft pilots without 
leaving the ground or putting themselves, their instructors or their aircraft at 
risks. With the advent of high speed digital computers, simulators are also 
used in the theme park or entertainment industry for simulating high risk 
activities such as catastrophes or down hill skying. Such non traditional use 
of simulators is popular because the passengers or users sitting on board of 
these equipments experience the exhilaration of dramatic motion cues as 
well as the sensation of gravity forces when the simulators mimic the motion 
of, for example, a world class down hill skier. Prior art simulators are designed with aircraft pilot training in mind. As 
such, the extent of motion cues measured by the degrees of freedom is 
limited by the design of the motion systems, the weight of the fuselage 
sections, the instructor's control room and video/audio systems atop the 
simulator platform. In general, the motion system of prior art simulators teaches the use of 
one tier of hydraulic jacks of various configuration to provide motion cues in 
one or more degrees of freedom. In other words, the jacks connect the base 
and the underframe of the platform directly and exclusively without other 
intervening connectors or jacks. U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,101 illustrates a flight 
simulator which teaches a single tier of three jacks and scissors for 
supporting a platform having an airplane cockpit and instructor's control 
room. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,412 shows an earthquake simulator for  
 
a theme park having one tier of vertical jacks and a set of horizontal jacks 
under the platform. Although U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,551,101 and 5,009,412 
suggest movement of four, five or six degrees of freedom are possible, the 
extent of movement beyond three degrees of freedom is restricted by the 
height limitation in U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,101 and by perpendicular 
arrangement of the vertical and horizontal jacks in U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,412.  The present invention describes a motion generating system for 
simulator having a multi-tier assembly of jacks. The multi-tier jacks permit 
the platform and equipment on it to move freely and safely in six degrees of
