<ABSTRACT>
German Laid-open Application DE-A 43 05 781 describes a process for the sorption of NH3 by sorbants, including certain transition metal salts, in particular copper salts, on preferably amorphous oxidic supports. The sorbed NH3 can be desorbed again. It has now been found that the desorbed NH3 can be oxidized on suitable catalysts to give N2 and water. In this procedure, the energy consumption necessary for the purification of gas streams containing NH3 can be greatly decreased.
