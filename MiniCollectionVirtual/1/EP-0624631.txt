<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is reuse of the filtrate 
of a paint mist-cleaning water mixture as cleaning water 

without reduction in concentration efficiency. 
According to the present invention, a waste paint-cleaning 
water mixture 2 available on trapping a water-based paint mist 

in cleaning water 1 is concentrated to recover the paint and 
the aqueous phase is recycled as cleaning water. In this 

system, the cleaning water prepared by reusing the aqueous 
phase is adjusted to an acid value of not greater than 10 and 

a pH value of 7.0 to 9.0. Controlling the amount of low 
molecular acid components in the aqueous phase in this manner 

prevents an abnormal viscosity increase in the filtration-concentration 
of the waste paint-cleaning water mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for recycling an
effluent water in a paint recovery system where a waste water-based
paint trapped in a spray booth cleaning water is
separated from the cleaning effluent for reuse.Spray coating with a water-based paint in a spray booth
involves generation of large quantities of paint mist
particles not deposited on a substrate and these mist
particles are generally trapped in a spray booth cleaning
water (booth circulating water) as a dilute aqueous solution
or dispersion of the paint. While the paint mist so collected
in the cleaning water amounts to a substantial quantity,
discarding the waste paint-containing water as it is results
not only in a loss of the paint but also in pollution
problems.Studies have been undertaken on the recovery and reuse of the
paint trapped in cleaning water and Japanese Kokai Publication
Sho-49-51324, for instance, describes such a recovery
technique. According to this technique, a dilute solution or
dispersion of the paint available on entrapment of the spray
mist in spray-booth cleaning water is concentrated by means of
an ultrafiltration membrane or reverse-osmosis filter
membrane to a level comparable to the nonvolatile content of
the original water-based paint. Thus, this dilute aqueous 
paint solution or dispersion is concentrated to separate the
water-based paint for reuse.When the dilute aqueous paint solution or dispersion is
concentrated using an ultrafiltration or other membrane filter
for recovering the trapped paint from the cleaning water as
mentioned above, a large quantity of effluent water
(hereinafter referred to as filtrate) is produced. To
discard this filtrate, a system for disposal of the waste
water will have to be provided. To avoid this, the filtrate
is usually returned to the spray booth for reuse as cleaning
water.However, in recycling said filtrate as spray-booth cleaning
water, repetition of the recovery of dilute waste paint-water
mixture, filtration-concentration thereof and the reuse of the
filtrate leads ultimately to an abnormal increase in the
viscosity of the paint being concentrated in the paint
recovery step so that it becomes increasingly difficult to
continue concentration up to a level approximating the
nonvolatile matter concentration of the original paint (for
example 50%) and, moreover, it takes a long time for
the filtration-concentration to be carried through.Not fully clear is the mechanism by which the repeated use of
the filtrate causes an increase in the viscosity of the paint
bein
