<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a benzene, 
pyridine or pyrimidine derivative or a pharmacologically 
acceptable salt thereof which has an 
excellent activity as a drug. Cerebrovascular diseases such as cerebral 
apoplexy and cardiac infarction which rank high in the 
list of death causes in Japan are all caused by the 
sclerosis of the arteries.  Although hypolipidemic drugs which are effective 
in lowering the content of lipid, particularly 
cholesterol in the blood have been mainly used for the 
prevention and treatment of arteriosclerosis, no 
decisively effective drug has been found as yet. Many studies have been made on arteriosclerosis 
and it has recently been found that an enzyme called 
ACAT (acyl-CoA: cholesterol O-acyl transferase) 
present in the arterial wall acts as an important 
factor in the formation of fat striae which are 
obserbed in arteriosclerosis (atherosclerosis). That is, the formation of cholesterol ester on 
the arterial wall is catalyzed by the ACAT, so that an 
increase in the amount of the ACAT participates in the 
excess accumulation of cholesterol ester. 
Accordingly, it is expectable that the excess 
accumulation of cholesterol ester on the arterial wall 
may be controlled by the inhibition of the ACAT. Meanwhile, the ACAT is also known to participate 
in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. That is, 
dietary cholesterol and cholesterol discharged into 
the intestines by the adaptation of a living body  
 
itself in a state mixed with bile are absorbed as free 
cholesterol, esterified by the action of the ACAT, 
packed into chylomicrons and discharged into the 
blood. Accordingly, it is expectable that the 
intestinal absorption of cholesterol may be controlled 
by the inhibition of the ACAT in the intestines. The inventors of the present invention have 
eagerly studied for many years on a compound which 
exhibits an inhibitory activity against the ACAT of 
the arterial wall and the intestines to thereby hinder 
the excess accumulation of cholesterol ester on the 
arterial wall and the intestinal absorption of 
cholesterol with their attentions being paid to the 
ACAT to find out that a benzene or pyrimidine 
derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable salt 
thereof can attain the object as will be described 
below. Although compounds exhibiting an inhibitory 
activity against the ACAT have been proposed in, for 
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,623,662, 4,489,094, 
4,489,090, 4,824,843 and 4,285,951 and Japanese Patent
