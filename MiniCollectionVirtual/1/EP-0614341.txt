<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a method for controlling the progress of fatigue of a person doing some kind of a tiring activity and for prevention of the effects of fatigue. Subject of the invention is further an instrument for sensing fatigue, states of shock and/or acute stress, completed with a device for evaluating the temperatures on the surface of parts of the body. First, the temperatures of the presumably hottest and coldest spots on the head of the person are taken at a state of rest, then temperatures of the same hottest and coldest points are taken periodically or continuously in the course of the activity, the difference of the corresponding temperature data are calculated and their changes are watched; when the change of the temperature difference exceeds a predetermined value, the person is either warned and/or given a refreshing treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for measuring of sensing the
progress of fatigue according to the precharacterizing part of
claim 1 and and an instrument for sensing fatigue, states of
shock and/or acute stress according to the precharacterizing
part of claim 6.An activity most typically tiring, the breaking off of
which usually depends not on the state of fatigue but on
other factors (e.g. arriving at the destination, end of
shift, etc.), is driving a car.It is known that most people become alert and active
when starting driving, which, among other things, manifests
itself in an increased stimulus of motion and speech. After
several hours of driving, drivers grow more irritable,
their movements get slower and their way of driving becomes
more careless. It is provable that pending on the distance
and the time of driving, a temporary vascular stenosis
appears, mainly in the small blood vessels of the drivers.
People in this state more often have accidents, that is why
it is important to recognize and prevent or cancel this
condition. It is also known that the states of shock and
acute stress primarily appear in the form of the
constriction of the small vessels.There exists a diagnostic method (Hungarian patent of
the Inventor No. 191 121) capable of examining people
(expediently drivers) exposed to stress, which is based on
the statistical processing of the changes in thermograms of
the face, and the purpose of which is to detect and measure
the tolerance of drivers and the damages coming from their 
occupation. According to the procedure, thermograms -
pictures of the infrared radiation - of the face and hands
of the person to examine are made before the stress is to
appear. The differences in the various parts of the
thermograms are recorded in a quantitative way, on the
basis of the dominant isotherms.The patients can be examined again after the stress
influence, depending on the aim of the examination.There is not known any applicable method based on the
above principle to detect the process of fatigue, because
it is too complicated and time-taking.There is a treatment for fatigue by means of an
instrument (EP 0 209 246 A1) generating electromagnetic
fields mounted on the back of the driver's seat. It
consists of the flat coil on the back of the seat and an
impulse generator connected to it. The impulse generator
produces 5 impulses 5 msec long each with 15 msec long
pauses, repeating this for 30 minutes with 100 msec pauses
every four hours.The flux density induced in the coil is 50 Gauss of
which

the activity are taken at a state of rest, then

temperatures of the same hottest and coldest points are
taken periodically or continuously in the course of the

activity, the difference of the corresponding temperature
data of the hottest and the coldest spots are calculated

and the changes of the temperature differences are watched. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that when the
change of the temperature difference exceeds a predetermined

value, the person is warned.
