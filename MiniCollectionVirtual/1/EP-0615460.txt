<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) is used to apply medicament to an eye and stores the medicament in a medicament chamber (38). A nozzle (20) is coupled in fluid communication with the medicament chamber and is formed by an outer nozzle portion (22) and an inner nozzle portion (24) received within the outer nozzle portion. A seam (25) is formed by the interface of the inner nozzle portion and the outer nozzle portion and is normally in a closed position to prevent the passage of medicament through the nozzle. The seam opens in response to the flow of medicament of sufficient pressure into the seam to permit the passage of medicament through the nozzle for release into the eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for dispensing
fluid through a nozzle, such as ocular treatment
apparatus for applying medicament or other substances to
an eye.There are various known devices for applying medicament
to the eye. A typical eye-drop container has a flexible
vial and a nozzle for releasing drops of medicament into
the eye by squeezing the vial. If the user squeezes too
hard, too much medicament can be released and, as a
result, drip down the user's cheek. There is typically
no means provided for accurately controlling the volume
of each dose of medicament released into the eye. Also,
if the tip of the nozzle becomes contaminated, there is
typically no means provided for preventing the
contaminated tip from contaminating the medicament within
the vial, and thus possibly causing infection by use of
the contaminated medicament. Because the medicament in
such devices is typically exposed to air upon opening the 
nozzle, it is not desirable to use such devices to
administer preservative-free formulations of
medicament, other than by providing single-dose
containers. The single-dose containers, however, are
typically relatively expensive to package,
particularly when used for prescription medications.US Patent No. 4,981,479 describes and illustrates a
medicament-dispensing apparatus having a nozzle
orifice through which medicament is dispensed from a
medicament chamber. In this apparatus, an internal
valve mechanism prevents the flow of medicament that
had been exposed to air back into the medicament
chamber. However, because the nozzle orifice has a
fixed diameter and is always exposed to air,
possibility of contamination of, and subsequent
dispensation of, a significant amount of residual
medicament in the nozzle orifice exists.EP-A-473,892 describes and illustrates another
medicament-dispensing apparatus having a nozzle
orifice through which medicament is dispensed from a
medicament chamber. This apparatus also features an
internal valve mechanism that normally separates the
nozzle orifice from the medicament chamber and the
associated delivery channel. Because the nozzle
orifice has a fixed diameter and is exposed to air,
the residual medicament in the nozzle orifice is
subject to contamination. Furthermore, because the
valve mechanism includes a spring-loaded, sliding
piston that comes into contact with both the opening
of the nozzle orifice and the delivery channel
associated with the medicament chamber, the sliding
piston is prone to transfer contaminated residual
medicament
