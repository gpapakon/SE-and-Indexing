salt thereof, a DNA comprising a DNA fragment coding for 

the protein, a method for preparing the protein, antibody

antibodies. 
A PACAP receptor protein was purified from the bovine 
cerebrum. DNAs coding for PACAP receptor proteins were 

isolated from bovine, rat and human cDNA libraries, and 
their nucleotide sequences were determined. Further, amino 

acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences were 
determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pituitary adenylate 
cyclase activating polypeptide (hereinafter referred to 
"PACAP") receptor protein (hereinafter may be referred to 
"PACAP receptor protein") or a salt thereof which is capable 
of binding a PACAP, a DNA 
comprising a DNA fragment coding for said protein, a method 
for preparing said protein or the salt thereof, and use of 
said protein and said DNA. PACAP was first isolated from the hypothalami of sheep 
as a peptide promoting adenylate cyclase activity of the 
pituitary glands [Biochemical Biophysical Research 
Communications, 164, 567-574 (1989)]. PACAP first isolated 
was one consisting of 38 amino acid residues. However, the 
presence of PACAP consisting of 27 residues on the N-terminal 
side was also revealed. Both are nearly equal in 
adenylate cyclase activating ability to each other. The 
former is referred to as PACAP38, and the latter is 
referred to as PACAP27. The expression of a PACAP having 
the same structure as that of sheep was also proved in 
humans, which suggested that PACAPs are important peptides 
conserved beyond species [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 
166, 81-89 (1990)]. For the distribution thereof in 
organs, they are observed not only in the brain 
hypothalami, but also in the pituitary glands, the testes  
 
and the adrenals (Endocrinology, 129, 2787-2789). At 
present, PACAPs such as PACAP27 to PACAP38 (U.S. Patent No. 
5,128,242) and PACAP23 to PACAP26 (European Patent 
Publication No. 0467279A3) have been reported. Physiological actions of PACAPs diversely varies 
according to their occurrence sites. Various actions of 
the PACAPs as described below have hitherto been reported: 
(1) Promotion of cAMP production in primary culture 
cells of the rat pituitary glands [A. Miyata et al., 
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 164, 567-574 (1989)]; (2) Promotion of secretion of GH, ACTH, PRL and LH in 
the rat pituitary gland superfusion process [A. Miyata et 
al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 164, 567-574 (1989)]; (3) Production of cAMP in adrenomedullary 
chromaffinoma-derived cells PC12h and promotion of neurite 
outgrowth [T. Watanabe et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. 
Commun., 173, 252-258 (1990), and K. Okazaki et al., FEBS 
Letters, 298, 49-56 (1992)]; (4) Promotion of interleukin-6 production in pituitary 
gland culture cells [I. Tatsuno et al., Endocrinology, 129, 
1797-1804 (1991)]; and (5) Promotion of cAMP production in primary culture of 
rat astrocytes and promotion of action preventing nerve 
cell death
