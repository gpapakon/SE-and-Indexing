<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method for recovering adhering meat from cutlet bones as well as a separator for implementing this method. The essential element of the separator is a hollow drum (1) with a perforated outer surface (7), against which a pressing belt (2) is pressed, partially looping around the hollow drum (1) in the process. The hollow drum (1) exhibits, in its central region, a groove (8) which runs around the drum radially and has perforated boundary surfaces. The cross-section of the groove (8) corresponds essentially to that of the bone strand which is to be processed.

Separator for carrying out a method for obtaining residual meat from the bones of 
strips of chops of slaughtered warm-blooded animals, especially of pigs, comprising a 

rotationally driven hollow drum (1), which is open at one end, with perforated 
circumferential surface (7), a resilient, endless press belt (2), which loops by its outer 

surface around the hollow drum (1) over a part of the circumference thereof and is guided 
to form a wedge intake (16) for the stock to be pressed and, under the action of pressing 

means (17), a press zone, as well as a cleaning-out device (3) in the interior of the hollow 
drum (1) and a stripper device (5) associated with the outer circumferential surface (7) 

thereof, characterised thereby that the hollow drum (1) has at least one radial encircling 
groove (8) which interrupts the circumferential surface (7) thereof and the cross-section of 

which substantially corresponds with the cross-sectional shape of the bone strip of the 
strips of chops to be processed. 
Separator according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the circumferential 
surface (7) of the hollow drum (1) is penetrated by perforations at least in the region of the 

groove (8). 
Separator according to claim 1 or 2 with a cleaning-out device (3) in the form of a 
conveyor worm (18), which is introducable into the interior of the hollow drum (1) from the 

open end thereof, with at least one helically wound web (19) matched to the internal profile 
of the hollow drum (1), characterised thereby that the forwardly facing part (20) of the web 

(19) can be brought into an envelope circle, the diameter of which is smaller than the 
smallest inner diameter of the hollow drum (1), against the rotational direction of the hollow 

drum (1). 
Separator according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that a guide 
device (4) for positionally exact feeding of the bone strips in relation to the position of the 

groove (8) in the circumferential surface (7) of the hollow drum (1) is arranged directly in 
front of the wedge intake (16).
