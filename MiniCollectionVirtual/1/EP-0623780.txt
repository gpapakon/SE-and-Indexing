<ABSTRACT>
A projection lens for vehicle headlamps is proposed for creating a dipped-light pattern, in which the convex emission surface of the lens has sections which project differently, an upper section being provided which is situated above the horizontal plane through the optical axis and a lower section being provided which lies below this horizontal plane, having the characterising feature that at least two lower sections are provided, one of which has an upper limit (B) which rises above the horizontal plane (8) towards the lateral lens edge, or a surface (free surface) is provided which projects in a continuously different manner.

A vehicle headlight projection lens for creating a low beam pattern, wherein the 
convex light-emitting surface of the lens has portions of different image-forming 

characteristics, provision being made for an upper portion located above the horizontal 
plane through the optical axis and a lower portion located below this horizontal plane, 

characterized in that at least two lower portions are provided, one of which has an 
upper boundary ascending above said horizontal plane (8) towards the lateral edge of 

the lens, and/or that a surface with steadily varied image-forming characteristics (so-called 
complex surface or computer-calculated surface) is provided. 
The projection lens according to claim 1, characterized in that the ascending upper 
boundary (B), preferably located on one side of the vertical plane through the optical 

axis, contacts the horizontal plane in a point (4), which is the intersection of a 
horizontal ray (7) with the light-emitting surface, said horizontal ray running from the 

intersection (P) of said optical axis (3) with the light-receiving surface (5) of the lens, 
facing towards the source of light at an angle with regard to said optical axis. 
The projection lens according to claim 2, characterized in that the angle between 
horizontal ray (7) and optical axis (3) is between ± 5°. 
The projection lens according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
curvatures of the light-emitting surface in vertical section through lens (1) become less 

arcuate from horizontal plane (7) through optical axis (3) towards the respective edge of 
the lens. 
The projection lens according to claim 4, characterized in that the length of the lens 
contour is longer in the upper lens portion than in the lower lens portion. 
The projection lens according to any of claims 4 to 5, characterized in that the 
curvatures of the light-emitting surface in the lower portion form a mirror image with  

 
regard to the horizontal plane (8) through the optical axis (3) of the curvatures in the 

upper portion. 
The projection lens according to any of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the lower 
portion having the ascending upper boundary (8) is formed by pivoting the imaginary 

lower portion confined by the intersection curve (C) of the vertical plane running 
through the horizontal beam (7) with the light-emitting surface, the intersection curve of 

the horizontal plane (8) through the optical axis (3) with the radiating surface, and the 
lens edge (2), by 15° around horizontal beam (7), a transition wedge zone of 

approximation curvature being provided between said pivoted portion and the 
remaining lower portion. 
The projection lens according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the light-receiving 
surface (5) of lens (1) is plane and at right angles to the optical axis (3). 
The projection lens according to claim 8, characterized in that the light-receiving 
surface (5) is provided as a rectangle for coupling to a bundle of light-transporting 

elements. 
The projection lens according to claim 9, characterized in that the lower boundary 
of the light-receiving surface is located in the horizontal plane (8) through the optical 

axis (3). 
The projection lens according to any of claims 9 or 10, characterized in that the lens 
body extends from the light-receiving surface (5) to the light-emitting surface 

substantially in the form of a truncated pyramid or of a truncated cone.
