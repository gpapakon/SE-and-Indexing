<ABSTRACT>
The cleaning machine has a cabin (1) extending above and on either side of the bicycle (4) containing cleaning sprays and/or drying devices (8). At least 2 devices lie on either side of the bicycle, each having a rotary cleaning brush (9) moved parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bicycle via a carriage (10) displaced along a guide rail (11), suspended from the roof of the cabin at a height which lies above the bicycle. Pref. the cleaning fluid and the drying jets are controlled automatically (18) in conjunction with the electric motors for the carriage displacement and the brush rotation.

Apparatus for cleaning a two-wheeled vehicle, in particular a bicycle, comprising a 
cabin enclosing the vehicle at least laterally and at the top, in which cabin a cleaning 

device comprising a spray and/or drying device is provided, characterised in that the 
cleaning device (8) comprises at least two rotary brush-like cleaning rollers (9) 

positioned on either side of the vehicle (4) and spray and/or drying devices associated 
with the cleaning rollers (9), which devices together are movable laterally along the 

vehicle (4) by means of a slide (10, 26) movable on a longitudinal rail (11) extending 
parallel to the vehicle longitudinal axis. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the longitudinal rail (11) 

extends above the vehicle (4), which is suspended in a hanging device (5) disposed in 
the cabin (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the spraying and/or 
drying devices (16) are disposed on either side of the cleaning rollers (9). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the cleaning 
rollers (9) and/or the spraying and/or drying devices (16) are coupled by a link 

connection (19) to the slide (10). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the cleaning 
rollers (9) and/or the spraying and/or drying devices (16) are movable perpendicular to 

the direction of motion of the slide (26) by means of transverse slides (24) movable on 
a cross-rail (25) of the slide (26). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that in the 
cabin (1) at least one hand cleaning device (20), in particular a brush, discharging 

cleaning fluid is provided. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that in the 
cabin (1) at least one hand drying device (22), in particular a blower, is provided.
