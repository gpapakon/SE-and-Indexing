<ABSTRACT>
In a camera (10), data is recorded onto a film magnetic 
layer (36) by anhysteretic recording with a device comprised 

of a planar master medium (27) attached to a ring core (46), the 
core a magnetic field gap formed therein at the point 

at which it is attached to the master medium (27). A 
slightly underdamped L/C resonant circuit is formed 

with excitation windings on the core (46) to provide an 
alternating bias field to the master medium (27) to effect 

the anhysteretic recording of the master data onto the 
film magnetic layer (36). Provision is made to ensure 

intimate contact between the master medium (27) and the film 
magnetic layer while the film is stationary during the 

recording process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of 
photographic film cameras and more specifically to 
cameras adapted to magnetically record data onto a film 
magnetic layer. Magnetic recording of data in a camera onto a 
magnetic layer formed on the photographic film is a 
well known concept, an example of which is described in 
commonly assigned US. Patent 5,021,820 dated June 4, 
1991. Generally, the film with its magnetic layer is 
transported past a magnetic recording head to which a 
digital data signal is applied to serially transfer the 
data bitwise onto the magnetic layer. It is known that 
accurate knowledge of the film velocity as it is 
transported past the record head is required to 
properly record data by this means. An alternative approach in magnetic recording of 
data on film which does not involve film velocity 
consideration is to contact print the digital data from 
a pre-recorded master medium onto a target slave medium 
comprised of the film magnetic layer. The basic 
concept of contact printing of magnetic data is also 
well known and is used extensively in the mass 
production of pre-recorded magnetic tapes from a master 
tape. It is important in contact printing of magnetic 
data that there be no relative motion between the 
master and slave media during the contact printing  
 
transfer process. In general, contact printing of magnetic data is 
performed using one of two basic methods. In one, 
referred, as "hysteretic recording", a master medium is 
employed that has sufficient magnetic properties 
(surface field magnitude) such that only intimate 
contact with the slave medium is needed to initiate the 
contact printing process. With this method, the 
contact printing transfer process ceases when the 
master and slave media are sufficiently separated. 
Separation must be accomplished carefully such that 
there is no relative motion between master and slave in 
the plane of the magnetic surface. In the alternative method, known as "anhysteretic" 
recording, a master medium is provided that has a 
relative low surface field magnitude that by itself, is 
insufficient to affect the intended slave medium. The 
actual contact printing transfer process is realized by 
making intimate contact between the master and slave 
media and then applying an alternating magnetic field 
which has sufficient magnitude that, when summed with 
the surface field from the master medium, results in a 
switching of all the slave medium particles thus 
transferring the master data onto the slave medium. As
