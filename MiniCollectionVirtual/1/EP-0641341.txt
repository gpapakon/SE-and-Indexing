Process for preparing benzo[b]naphthyridines of

general formula:


in which R is a carboxyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, cyano,
carbamoyl, alkylcarbamoyl, benzylcarbamoyl or

hydroxyethylcarbamoyl radical or a dialkylaminoethylcarbamoyl
or dialkylcarbamoyl radical in which the alkyl

portions, with the nitrogen atom to which they are
attached, can optionally form a 5- or 6-membered

heterocycle optionally containing another hetero atom
chosen from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen and optionally

substituted on the nitrogen with an alkyl radical, R' is
a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, fluoroalkyl, carboxylalkyl,

cycloalkyl (containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms),
fluorophenyl, difluorophenyl, alkyloxy or alkylamino

radical and Hal is a halogen atom, as well as their salts
where they exist, characterized in that the following

operations are performed:

1) condensation in basic medium of an amine of general
formula:


R'-NH-CH
2
-CH
2
-R''

in which R' is defined as before and R'' is an
alkyloxycarbonyl, cyano, carbamoyl, alkylcarbamoyl,

benzylcarbamoyl or hydroxyethylcarbamoyl radical or a 
dialkylaminoethylcarbamoyl or dialkylcarbamoyl radical in

which the alkyl portions, with the nitrogen atom to which
they are attached, can optionally form a 5- or 6-membered

heterocycle optionally containing another hetero atom
chosen from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen and optionally

substituted on the nitrogen with an alkyl radical, with
a chlorofluoroquinoline of general formula:



in which Hal is defined as above and R
1
 is a hydrogen
atom or an alkyl radical, on the understanding that the

alkyl radicals mentioned above are unbranched or branched
and contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
2) cyclization in basic medium of the fluoroquinoline
thereby obtained, of general formula :



in which R', R'' and Hal are defined as before and R
1
 is
defined as above in 1),
3) oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, optionally in the
presence of potassium iodide, of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[b]

[1,8] naphthyridine of general formula :



in which Hal, R' and R'' are defined as before, and then,
optionally, conversion of the ester obtained for which R

is alkyloxycarbonyl to an acid for which R is a carboxyl
radical and, optionally, conversion of the acid obtained

to a salt.
Benzonaphthyridine derivative of general formula : 


in which R' and Hal are defined as in claim 1 and R is a
cyano, carbamoyl, alkylcarbamoyl, benzylcarbamoyl or

hydroxyethylcarbamoyl radical or a dialkylaminoethylcarbamoyl
or dialkylcarbamoyl radical in which the alkyl

portions, with the nitrogen atom to which they are
attached, can optionally form a 5- or 6-membered

heterocycle optionally containing another hetero atom
chosen from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen and optionally

substituted on the nitrogen with an alkyl radical.
