<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a liquid
crystal display device and a method of manufacturing
the same, and particularly to a liquid crystal display
element having a wide viewing angle characteristic and
a method manufacturing it.Conventionally, a liquid crystal display
device using a nematic liquid crystal display element
is widely employed in a segmented-figure display element
such as a watch, or an electronic calculator. On
transparent substrates of such a liquid crystal display
device, active elements such as thin film transistors
are formed as switching means for selectively driving
pixel electrodes which applies a voltage to a liquid
crystal, and color filter layers such as red, green and
blue are formed so as to display color images. On the
basis of the twist angle of a liquid crystal, liquid
crystal display systems are classified as follows:
(a) an active drive twisted nematic (hereinafter,
abbreviated as "TN") liquid crystal display system in
which nematic liquid crystal molecules are aligned by
being twisted by 90°, and (b) a multiplex drive super
twisted nematic (hereinafter, abbreviated as "STN")
liquid crystal display system in which the twist angle
of the nematic liquid crystal molecules is set to be
90° or more to utilize the sharpness of the transmittance-applied
voltage characteristic. In the latter multiplex drive STN liquid
crystal display system, there is a peculiar color phenomenon.
In the case where a monochrome display is to
be conducted, therefore, the multiplex drive STN liquid
crystal display system is further classified roughly as
follows on the basis of the kind of optical phase
difference element: Namely, the multiplex drive STN
liquid crystal display system includes (b-1) a two-layered
double super twisted nematic liquid crystal
display system which uses a display liquid crystal cell
and a liquid crystal cell wherein molecules are twist
aligned by a twist angle opposite to that of the display
liquid crystal cell, and (b-2) a film-addition
type liquid crystal display system in which a film
having an optical anisotropy is disposed. It is considered
that the film-addition type liquid crystal
display system of (b-2) is advantageous from the view
points of the reduction of weight and cost.On the other hand, the former active drive TN
liquid crystal display system of (a) is classified
roughly into (a-1) a normally black system in which a
pair of polarizing plates are arranged in such a manner
that their polarizing directions are parallel to each
other and black is displayed
