 DescriptionPolyanionic Polyamino Acid Inhibitors Of Mineral Deposition And Their SynthesisTechnical FieldThis invention relates to the discovery of new polyamino acids and their synthesis. The polyamino acids are powerful inhibitors of mineral formation, particularly the crystallization of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. The molecules may be useful in a variety of applications including but not limited to tartar control, prevention of industrial scaling, use as dispersants, corrosion inhibition, prevention of pathological calcification, and control of biofouling.Background ArtBiological mineralization is a fundamental process in nature. Unfortunately mineral deposits frequently occur where they are not wanted. In the body, mineral deposition may contribute to dental plaque, hardening of the arteries, various organ stones and the failure of prosthetic devices like implanted heart valves. In the marine environment, the- biomineral structures may cause problems as in the case of barnacles growing on the hulls of ships, adding extra bulk and creating drag. In industry, mineral scale forms on surfaces of cooling towers and other devices preventing their proper operation as heat exchangers and frequently promoting localized corrosion.Because of the problems associated with unwanted mineral deposition, much effort has been devoted to 

 finding mineralization inhibitors, particularly in industry, that might be used to prevent harmful mineral formation.Among the newest approaches to developing mineral deposition inhibitors is the study of naturally-occurring proteins and polysaccharides that regulate mineral formation by organisms (Sikes, CS. and A.P. Wheeler (1985) . Inhibition of inorganic or biological CaC03 deposition by polyamino acid derivatives. U.S. Patent 4,534,881; Sikes, CS. and A.P. Wheeler (1986).Inhibition of inorganic and biological CaC03 deposition by a polysaccharide fraction obtained from CaC03-forming organisms. U.S. Patent 4,585,560; Wheeler, A.P. and CS. Sikes (1986) . Inhibition of the formation of inorganic or biological CaC03-containing deposits by a proteinaceous fraction obtained from CaC03-forming organisms. U.S. Patent 4,587,021). This approach led to the identification of a new class of polyanionic/hydrophobic peptides (Sikes, CS. and A.P. Wheeler (1989) . Inhibition of mineral deposition by polyanionic/hydrophobic peptides and derivatives thereof having a clustered block copolymer structure. U.S. Patent 4,868,287) and phosphorylated and related polyanionic peptides
