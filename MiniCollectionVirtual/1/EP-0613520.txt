<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion 
engine in which liquid fuel is introduced prior to the 
charge entering the combustion chambers (e.g. CH-A-603 993). In petrol engines in which mixture preparation takes 
place outside the combustion chambers, for example by means 
of a carburettor or fuel injectors supplying fuel into the 
intake manifold or intake ports, engine deceleration is 
accompanied by a rich incomplete combustion because some 
fuel is stored in the intake system and this is stripped off 
from the wetted surface of the walls of the intake manifold 
and intake ports during the deceleration mode by the high 
manifold depression. Even if the fuel supply is cut-off 
completely during the deceleration mode, a sudden excursion 
of exhaust emissions will still occur since the engine air 
supply has been restricted and the stored fuel is burnt in 
the combustion chamber with insufficient air. The duration 
of the excursion is relatively short as the quantity of the 
stored fuel is finite and once used up there is no more fuel 
but nevertheless unburnt hydrocarbons are released to 
atmosphere during these periods as there is not sufficient 
oxygen in the exhaust system to allow them to be oxidised, 
even in a catalytic converter. The present invention seeks to cut down on this source 
of air pollution by reducing the unburnt hydrocarbon content 
of the exhaust gases during deceleration modes. According to the present invention, there is provided 
an internal combustion engine in which liquid fuel is 
introduced into the air intake system prior to the charge 
entering the combustion chambers and which is mounted in a 
vehicle having an air scoop acting as a source of ram air 
pressurised by the movement of the vehicle, characterised in 
that the ram air is fed into the exhaust system of the 
engine by way of an isolation valve which is opened only 
during engine deceleration modes.  
 In order to complete the combustion of the unburnt 
hydrocarbons in the exhaust system, a source of additional 
oxygen is required. Hitherto, various proposals have been 
made to add air into the exhaust system under different 
operating conditions. For this purpose, pulse air system 
have been put forward which rely on the pulsation of the 
gases in the exhaust manifold to draw in air during negative 
pressure parts of the cycles but such system do not draw in 
air during deceleration mode as the pressure pulse amplitude 
is severely attenuated at such times. Electrically driven 
air pumps have also

<CLAIMS>
An internal combustion engine (12) in which liquid 
fuel is introduced into the air intake system (20) prior to 

the charge entering the combustion chambers and which is 
mounted in a vehicle having an air scoop (34) acting as a 

source of ram air pressurised by the movement of the 
vehicle, characterised in that the ram air is fed into the 

exhaust system (14) of the engine (12) by way of an 
isolation valve (36) which is opened only during engine 

deceleration modes. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the isolation valve (36) is operated by an 

electronic control unit having sensors detecting manifold 
vacuum and engine speed, the valve being opened when the 

manifold vacuum exceeds a speed related threshold. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the isolation valve (36) is operated by a vacuum 

actuator connected to manifold vacuum. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any 
preceding claim, wherein a non-return valve (38) is 

arranged in series with the isolation valve (36). 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any 
preceding claim, wherein the ram air is fed individually 

into each exhaust port by means of a rail having branches 
passing through the branches of the exhaust manifold and 

terminating in close proximity to the exhaust valves. 
An internal combustion engine as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 4, having a catalytic converter and in which ram 

air is introduced into the exhaust system at a point common 
to all engine cylinders upstream of the catalytic converter.
