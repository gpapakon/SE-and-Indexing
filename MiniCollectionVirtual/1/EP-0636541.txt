<ABSTRACT>
A sailing craft having a hull (215) with a longitudinal 
midplane. A primary boom (210) is pivotally mounted on the 

hull (215) for 360° continuous rotation in either direction 
about a central vertical axis. The primary boom (210) is 

connected by lines (217, 218) to a sail boom (221). At least 
one angled mast (247) is mounted on the hull (215) and extends 

upwardly. The mast (217) has a top, the top is disposed 
approximately above the central vertical axis of the primary 

boom (210). A sail (230) is carried by the sail boom (221) 
and extends upwardly and substantially symmetrically about the 

central vertical axis. The sail (230) is supported from the 
top of the at least one mast (247). The sail boom (221) with 

the sail (230) thereon has completely free 360° rotation in 
either direction avoiding contact with the mast (247). The 

sail (230) has flake lines (249) swivelably connected to the 
top of the mast (247) permitting rotation of the sail (230) 

and flaking of the sail (230). A tension device maintains 
tension on the top of the halyard (243) so the sail (230) luff 

becomes tight when the primary boom (210) rotates either end 
forward.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a sail plan for a sailing 
craft such as a sailboat, and in particular for a sail craft 
having a three-sided sail mounted on a boom and rotatable 
about a vertical axis through 360°. The art of sailing has been practiced for thousands of 
years and is generally well known throughout the world. Most 
sailing craft utilize one or more masts which project upwardly 
from the hull and have at least one sail attached thereto. In 
small boats which are operated by one person, the need to 
constantly adjust the setting of the sail with respect to the 
direction of the wind while controlling the rudder and 
handling the various lines associated with the boom and the 
sail, is a difficult and strenuous operation. Various sails and mast configurations have been proposed 
and used to attempt to simplify the operation of sailing craft 
and/or to improve the efficiency of the sailing craft. The 
applicant is aware of the following which are considered 
pertinent to the present application.  Thus, despite interest in sails over a period of many 
years, there still exists a need for a simple system for a 
sail which enables a sailing craft to be operated by one 
individual with a minimum of effort and which provides 
increased maneuverability to the sailing craft. Further, the simplified sail permits the design of the 
sailing craft to be simplified and improved so that the 
sailing craft can be more easily handled under various 
conditions of wind. The disclosure of US Patent No. 5,231,943 is incorporated 
by reference in its entirety. A principal object of the invention is to provide a plan 
for a sail on a sailing craft which provides increased 
maneuverability to the sailing craft. It is another object of the present invention to provide 
a plan for a sail on a sailing craft, wherein the lower edge 
of a sail is connected to a boom, the boom being pivotable  
 
about a midpoint wherein pressure on the edges of the sides of 
the sail can be equalized. It is yet another object of the present invention to 
provide a sail attached to a boom rotatable in either 
direction through 360°, which when rotated through 180°, 
forward and aft are reversed and luff and leach interchange. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a sailing craft having a swivel plate attached to the 
top of the mast and flake lines extending vertically through 
the sail, the swivel plate preventing entanglement of the 
flake lines when the sail rotates 360° in either direction. In accordance with
