<CLAIMS>
Microspheres consisting of a polymer matrix and 
optionally of at least one active substance encapsulated 

in the said polymer matrix, which matrix is made of at 
least one hydroxy acid polymer or copolymer, characterized 

in that the said microspheres are free from constituents 
other than the active substance which is 

optionally present and the constituents of the polymer 
matrix, and in that the polymer matrix contains at least 

one hydroxy acid polymer or copolymer having a molecular 
mass of greater than 20,000, and in particular of greater 

than 40,000, and at least one hydroxy acid polymer or 
copolymer having a molecular mass of less than 5000. 
Microspheres according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the constituent of the polymer matrix has a 

bimodal distribution of molecular masses. 
Microspheres according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that they are smaller than 

500 Âµm in size. 
Process for the preparation of microspheres as 
defined in any one of the preceding claims, in which the 

said polymer or copolymer is dissolved in a water-immiscible 
volatile livid organic phase, an active 

substance is optionally dissolved or dispersed in the 
said organic phase, an emulsion of the organic phase 

obtained is prepared in an aqueous continuous phase, the 
solvent is evaporated off and, if so desired, the solid 

microspheres obtained are separated from the aqueous 
phase, this process being characterized in that the said 

polymer matrix comprises at least one hydroxy acid with 
an average molecular mass at least equal to 20,000, and  

 
at least one hydroxy acid with an average molecular mass 

of less than 5000, in that after production of the 
emulsion, the pH is adjusted to a value of 6-8 by addition 

of a base, and in that during the step of evaporating 
the organic solvent, the pH is adjusted to a value of 

6-8 by continuous addition or by repeated additions of a 
base. 
Process according to the preceding claim, characterized 
in that the poly(hydroxy acid) with an average 

molecular mass at least equal to 20,000 is chosen from 
polymers and copolymers of alpha-hydroxy acids. 
Process according to the preceding claim, characterized 
in that the said poly(alpha-hydroxy acid)s are 

chosen from poly(lactic acid)s and poly(glycolic acid)s. 
Process according to any one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the proportion of polymer of low 

molecular mass, relative to the polymer of high molecular 
mass, is sufficient to obtain microspheres having desired 

sufficiently low particle sizes. 
Process according to the preceding claim, characterized 
in that the said proportion may range from 30 to 

300% by weight, and in particular from 50 to 150% by 
weight. 
Microspheres characterized in that they may be 
obtained according to the process of any one of claims 4 

to 8. 
Drug based on microspheres as defined in any one 
of Claims 1 to 3 and 9.
