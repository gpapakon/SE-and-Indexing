<ABSTRACT>
A crank member (34) is pivotally supported on a connecting axis (β₁), a horizontal fulcrum (β₆) of the crank 
member (34) is connected to a portion (β₈) of a rack (18) through a longitudinal sub-link (37), and a vertical fulcrum 

(β₇) of the crank member (34) is connected to a portion (β₉) of a forward end link (27) through a lateral sub-link (38), 
whereby the forward end link (27) for supporting an optical instrument (33) for medical use is constantly held in a 

substantially vertical state. Accordingly, there is no possibility of hitting a person due to a large swing of the forward 
end link (27), so that the optical instrument provides suitable operability and sanitary feature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stand apparatus for use in microsurgery, capable of supporting an operating microscope and its associated equipment, which are heavy objects, with use of a supporting linkage mechanism utilizing a parallel linkage and balancing the weight of these elements with use of a counterweight to thereby keep the operating microscope and the like still in the air.A surgical operation such as a brain surgical operation and heart surgical operation is performed with an affected part being observed by an operator through an operating microscope. Accordingly, the operator strains his/her nerve because of very minute operation, and in many cases much time is spent for the operation. Such a long operating time will undesirably cause an increase in physical and mental fatigues of both the subject and the operator.A medical optical equipment such as an operating microscope plays a very important role in such a high-level operation and easiness of use of the medical optical equipment directly is followed by a reduction in the operating time. A conventional stand apparatus for permitting the medical optical equipment to be easily used is shown in Figs. 10 and 11, for example (see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 56-32110).Referring to Fig. 10, reference numerals 1 and 2 denote a base and a stand, respectively. The stand 2 is rotatable about a vertical axis α of rotation relative to the base 1. An electromagnetic clutch C is provided between the stand 2 and the base 1 to lock a rotational position of the stand 2 relative to the base 1. The base 1 is provided on its lower surface with casters 3 each having a locking mechanism and a vertically moving mechanism, thereby permitting the base 1 to be moved on an upper surface of a floor F and further permitting the base 1 to be locked at a desired position and to be adjusted in levelness.A first parallel linkage 4 is pivotally mounted through a fulcrum 5 to an upper end portion of the stand 2. The first parallel linkage 4 is rotatable about the fulcrum 5 in a frontward direction (a direction shown by an arrow A) or in a rearward direction (a direction shown by an arrow B), and can be locked by an electromagnetic clutch (not shown) provided at the fulcrum 5. An upper end of the first parallel linkage 4 is formed by a horizontal shaft 6, and a second parallel linkage 7 and a third parallel linkage 8 are interlockingly mounted to the horizontal shaft 6. A front end of the third parallel linkage 8 is formed by a front link 9 extended downwardly, and an
