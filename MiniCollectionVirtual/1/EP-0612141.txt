<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a power control method and device for a circuit including a resonance invertor intended to supply a variable-impedance load including an inductive component. The invention consists in making the active power absorbed by the load independent of the nature of the load, by deriving an error signal ( epsilon ) which is a function of the mean value of the current passing through the power transistors (T1, T2) of the invertor, this error signal being used to control a power modulator (M) controlling the switching of the transistors.
