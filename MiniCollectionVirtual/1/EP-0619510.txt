<ABSTRACT>
A camera including a combined shutter and adjustable 
aperture is characterized by resilient means for 

uniformly dampening oscillations during operation. The 
combined shutter and aperture includes a stepper motor 

that drives a plurality of blades between a closed 
aperture blocking position and a plurality of open 

aperture defining positions. The blades and stepper 
motor are coupled by a drive train that increases 

friction in the drive train uniformly in all positions 
of the blades. A counter weight is provided for 

balancing inertial forces on said ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of
photography, and more specifically to a combined
shutter and adjustable aperture in a photographic
camera including a plurality of blades and a stepper
motor for moving the blades between a closed position
and multiple open or exposure positions.It is known in the prior art to provide
apparatus that combines the photographic functions of
an adjustable exposure aperture and a shutter.
Typically two rectangular blades, each including a
tear-shaped hole therein, are mounted for relative
reciprocating movement between a closed position and a
plurality of open positions. In the closed position the
holes are offset and the blades act as a shutter to
block exposures. In the open positions the holes
overlap by increasing amounts to define multiple
exposure apertures that increase in size with the
amount of overlap of the holes in the blades.
Frequently the blades are driven between their
respective positions by a stepper motor under the
influence of a control circuit. The control circuit
includes sensors which determine the exposure
conditions of the subject. It then actuates the motor
to drive the blades open to the appropriate aperture.
The control also determines a suitable time interval
for the exposure at that aperture and energizes the
motor to close the blades. Although combined apertures and shutters
provide many advantages, they also present special
problems, particularly when the functions are combined
in an iris-type mechanism. These problems are
aggravated by the normal properties of stepper motors,
which can impose high torque and rapid transitions for
mechanical linkages, causing oscillations, bounding and
ringing at resonate frequencies. Even small deviations
from the desired mechanical movement can degrade
results when the impact is reflected in both aperture
size and exposure duration. At small apertures and
short exposure durations, such deviations can result in
a significant variance from the desired exposure value.Some existing devices use the control circuit
to provide special driving pulses according to a
program designed to minimize oscillations. Such
approaches increase the complexity of the mechanism and
may reduce exposure options to those consistent with
the program.The present invention is directed to
overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above, by providing a combined shutter and adjustable aperture mechanism and
a camera as defined in claims 1 and 5.
The camera is characterized by mechanical
structure for uniformly dampening
