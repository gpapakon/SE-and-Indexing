<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic toner containing a certain specific 
compound. In an image-forming process by means of an 
electrophotographic system, an electrostatic latent image 
is formed on an inorganic photoconductive material such 
as selenium, a selenium alloy, cadomiun sulfide or 
amorphous silicon, or on an organic photoconductive 
material employing a charge-generating material and a 
charge-transporting material, and the latent image is 
developed by a toner, then transferred and fixed on a 
paper sheet or plastic film to obtain a visible image. The photoconductive material may be positively 
electrifiable or negatively electrifiable depending upon 
its construction. When a printed portion is remained as 
an electrostatic latent image by exposure, development is 
conducted by means of an oppositely electrifiable toner. 
On the other hand, when a printed portion is destatisized  
 
for reversal development, development is conducted by 
means of an equally electrifiable toner. A toner is 
composed of a binder resin, a coloring agent and other 
additives. However, in order to impart desired 
tribocharge properties (such as desired charge up speed, 
tribocharge level and tribocharge level stability), 
stability with time and environmental stability, it is 
common to use a charge-control agent. The properties of 
the toner will be substantially affected by this charge-control 
agent. In a case where a negatively electrifiable 
photoconductive material is used for development with an 
oppositely electrifiable toner, or a positively 
electrifiable photoconductive material is used for 
reverse development, a positively electrifiable toner is 
used. In such a case, a positively electrifiable charge-control 
agent is used. Further, in a case of a color toner, it is necessary 
to use a colorless charge-control agent or a charge-control 
agent with a pale color which does not affect the 
color of the toner. Such pale-colored or colorless 
charge-control agents may, for example, be quaternary 
ammonium salt compounds disclosed in e.g. Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 119364/1982, No. 
9154/1983 and No. 98742/1983. However, these charge-control agents have drawbacks 
such that even when the toner has high electrifiability  
 
at the initial stage for the preparation of the 
developer, such electrifiability undergoes attenuation 
depending upon the storage conditions, and such 
attenuation tends to be remarkable especially when the 
temperature is high and the humidity
