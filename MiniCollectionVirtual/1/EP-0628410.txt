<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for screen printing from one edge to the other 
of an object in a rigid material, beside the conventional 

components for screen printing, includes second ink scraping 
means (8), acting on the lower face of the printing frame (3), for 

removing ink from the portion of design (5) that exceeds the 
perimetric dimensions of the object (6) to be printed. Through 

said apparatus it is possible to perform a method for screen 
printing from one edge to the other of an object made of a 

rigid material, which method consists of printing the design 
on the object, exceeding the printing on at least one of the 

edges of the object; spacing the printing frame from the 
printed object and scraping, from the lower face of the 

printing frame facing the object, ink which has not been 
deposited on the object because of the lesser dimensions of 

the object with respect of the design.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method
for silk-screen, or screen, printing from one edge to the
other of an object in a rigid material.As known, when screen printing on an object made of a rigid
material several variables have to be taken into account,
otherwise the quality of the printing is low.For example, when screen printing on an object it is always
necessary to check the standard parameters of the screen
printing process such as the fabric tension, the
compensation of the image deformation, the pressure,
stiffness and inclination of the doctor blade and, not least
important, the dimensional variation of the film or of the
frame due to the variations of the work conditions.There are even more difficulties in obtaining a good quality
screen printing when, as it normally happen, the object to
be printed is mass produced and its real dimensions, with
respect to the nominal designed dimensions, vary from the
first piece to the last one produced.The above problems in printing across the edges of an
object, are conventionally solved in a very simple way.The design to be printed on the object is realized on the
printing frame or screen, and is uniformly shrank for a
selected value (one millimeter or more) with respect of the
real perimetric dimensions of the object. In this manner, it is mathematically assured to always print
correctly, regardless of the dimensional variations of the
object due to the inability to maintain the working
tolerances in mass productions, or regardless of the
standard parameters used in screen printing.In other words, after centering the object on the frame,
since the design is smaller than the object, its final
result is always assured.The only inconvenience of this printing method is that the
printed object has an unprinted small area around the edges.
For example, if the rigid object to be printed is a vehicle
window pane, the peripheral black print (almost all the car
manufacturers adopt this solution) because of the above
reasons will not reach the edges of the pane and a
peripheral strip will remain unprinted.Recently, however, in the new automatic systems for
assembling the window panes on the vehicles, the pane edges
are left exposed and therefore the panes have to be printed
from one edge to the other without discontinuity.For the above reasons, the screen printing on windshields,
door windows, rear windows, overhead windows, etc., is
performed twice across two edges each time.It is easily understood however that with this solution
there is an
