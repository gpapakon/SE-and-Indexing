<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for electronically controlling charge coupled device (CCD) light sensitivity. The present invention controls CCD light sensitivity by electrically controlling a CCD (204) such that the CCD (204) discharges charge for a percentage of a field integration period. In other words, the present invention electronically varies the CCD's exposure time. The present invention operates as follows. First, the present invention calculates a new exposure time for a field integration period. Second, the present invention electrically causes the CCD (204) to discard charge accumulated by the CCD (204) during the field integration period except during a portion of the field integration period defined by the new exposure time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to imaging systems or
camera systems (such as photographic and video cameras), and more
particularly to exposure controls for imaging systems/camera systems.The use of charge coupled devices (CCDs) in camera imagers has
enabled the production of smaller and more durable camera imagers.
Much effort has been spent in developing exposure control systems for
effectively controlling imager sensitivity to incident light on the imager
(that is, for controlling the amount of charge a CCD accumulates during
a field integration period). Exposure control systems which regulate CCD
exposure sensitivity, such that picture quality is unaffected by changing
environmental lighting conditions, are desired. Such exposure control
systems greatly expand the dynamic range of performance of CCD-based
imagers, thereby increasing the commercial market for CCD-based camera
imagers. Herein, light refers to visible and non-visible light.In many conventional CCD-based camera imagers, the exposure
control systems are implemented using mechanical devices. Such
mechanical devices include a mechanical iris and/or a mechanical shutter
wheel. The most common implementation, the mechanical iris, varies the
rate at which the CCD receives photons. The mechanical shutter varies
the amount of time during which the CCD receives photons. Such exposure control systems are flawed, however, since
mechanical devices have a relatively low reliability, slow response time,
and increase the size and cost of the lens. Additionally, such exposure
control systems are flawed since the use of mechanical devices increases
the technical difficulty in the areas of loop stability and design transition
between different lenses.In some tube based cameras, such as some "VIDICON" cameras,
the exposure control systems can be non-mechanical in nature. Such
exposure control systems automatically control imager sensitivity by
controlling the voltage on the tube's target electrode.Since vacuum tube type imagers are larger and less rugged than
solid state imagers, solid state imager based cameras such as CCD
cameras are being used in place of the older tube technology based
cameras. In order to match all performance aspects of tube based
cameras with CCD based cameras, a non-mechanical exposure control
system for controlling CCD sensitivity is required. Due to the different
nature of the solid-state imager to the tube imager, the same electronic
exposure control technique as the tube-based imager cannot be utilized
for the
