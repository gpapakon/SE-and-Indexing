<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fiber optic
coupling devices, and more specifically to devices that
couple light energy between selected modes of two
dissimilar optical fibers.In fiber optic systems, it is frequently desirable to
remove, select, or suppress certain propagation modes of
an optical signal. For example, in a two-mode optical
fiber having an optical signal propagating therein in the
first and second order spatial propagation modes, it is
known that the light propagating in the second order mode
can be "stripped" from the optical signal within the fiber
by forming a segment of the fiber's length into a coil
having a suitably selected coil diameter. The coil
diameter is selected to perturb the second order mode
without substantially affecting the first order mode, such
that light propagating in the second order mode of the
fiber enters the cladding of the optical fiber and escapes
therefrom. The portion propagating in the first order
mode is guided by the fiber and remains within the fiber's
core. This light in the first order mode does not
ordinarily couple to the second order mode due to the
difference in propagation constants between the first
order and second order modes of the fiber. Thus, after
passing through the length of coil fiber, the optical
signal propagates substantially solely in the first order
propagation mode. Thus, the "mode stripper" allows the
selection of the light propagating in the first order mode
through removal of the light in the second order mode.Although a mode stripper is an advantageous device,
its uses are limited, since the light that is stripped
from the fiber merely radiates into free space. The mode
stripper does not have the capability of coupling selected
modes of two different optical fibers. The ability to 
couple a selected spatial mode of one optical fiber to a
selected spatial mode of another optical fiber has many uses
in a fiber optic system. For example, in a fiber optic
frequency shifter wherein light propagating in a first order
mode is coupled to a second order mode and is shifted in
frequency, it is desirable that the portion of the frequency
shifted light in the second order mode be coupled to a
selected mode of a different fiber so as to be able to
transmit the light at the shifted frequency. Thus, a need
exists for a mode selector which can, for example, separate
lower order modes (e.g., a first order mode) from higher
order modes (e.g., a second order mode) and provide the
higher order mode as an output for further use in the
