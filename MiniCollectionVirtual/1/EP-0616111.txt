<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine engine component support assembly (30) 
comprises a pair of ring members (64) and (74) defining a 

slot in which a cranked flange (28) extending from the 
inner surfaces of an array of combustion chamber discharge 

nozzles (22) is located. One part (28B) of the cranked 
flange has projections (28C) which engage with radial 

slots (76) formed in one of the ring members (74) to 
provide cross-key location of the discharge nozzles. The 

support assembly (30) is located adjacent the radially 
inner platform of an array of nozzle guide vanes (20), and 

also provides support and location for the vanes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to axial flow gas 
turbine engines, in particular to static structures for 
locating and supporting combustion chamber discharge 
nozzles and the nozzle guide vanes downstream of such 
discharge nozzles. A conventional present day axial flow gas turbine 
engine normally comprises, in axial flow sequence, a 
compressor section, a combustor (which may be radially 
disposed), in which compressed air from the high pressure 
compressor is mixed with fuel and burnt, and a turbine 
section driven by the products of combustion. In the case 
of an aeroengine (excluding turboshaft aeroengines), all 
the power developed by the turbine section is used to 
drive the compressor section, which can include a fan 
propulsor. In the case of a turboshaft engine, or an 
engine adapted for electrical power generation or marine 
propulsion, the turbine section has an upstream part which 
is used to drive the compressor section, and a downstream 
part comprising a power turbine on a power offtake shaft 
which rotates independently of the rest of the turbine 
section. Note that in the present specification, the terms 
"upstream" and "downstream" refer to the direction of 
compressed air and combustion gas flows through the axial 
flow compressors and turbines of axial flow gas turbine 
engines. Hence, for a component associated with a main gas 
passage of such a turbine or compressor, the upstream 
direction is towards the front of the engine and the 
downstream direction is towards its rear. The products of combustion pass from the combustor 
through discharge nozzles to the first stage of the 
turbine through an array of nozzle guide vanes. These 
nozzle guide vanes must be supported and located both 
axially and radially to cope with the dynamic and thermal 
loads occurring during engine operation.  
 The downstream end of the combustor must also be 
located and supported in such a way that it can cope with 
the dynamic and thermal loads which occur during engine 
operation. Furthermore, the support and location of the 
nozzle guide vanes and the downstream portion of the 
combustor should be such that loads applied to nozzle 
guide vanes do not impose loads upon the downstream 
portion of the combustor and vice versa. It is known from US3965066 to provide a combustion 
chamber discharge nozzle with an axially extending flange 
which locates in an annular slot in a ring located at the 
upstream end of the platform of an array of nozzle guide 
vanes. An object of the present invention is to
