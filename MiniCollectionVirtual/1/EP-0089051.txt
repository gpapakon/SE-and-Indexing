<DESCRIPTION>

"Self-disintegrating Formwork"
The invention concerns a formwork for casting of submerged constructions and use of such formworks.


An example of such constructions are cast joint sections on subaqueous steel pipelines, nowadays used for transport of oil and gas from off-shore oil fields, e.g. in the North Sea. The lines are composed of steel pipe elements, approx. length of 12 m, with an outer protective concrete layer (weight coating). The steel pipe ends on each pipe section are without concrete coating in order to allow for welding connection of the pipes.


For protection of the steel pipes along the welded parts a fluid asphalt mass is poured in the formworks built around the welding zone to encase the fluid mass until it solidifies. Steel sheets, approx. 1 mm thick, are used in this formwork and the formwork follows the pipeline to the sea bottom. The steel plates are manually bended, the work is time-consuming and cumbersome.


Under the prevailing conditions on board the barges, with high sea and gusts of wind, the work implies certain risks for the operators.


Furthermore, the corrosion of steel plates is uneven and too slow, so that the plate remains cause damages to fishing equipment (trawl/net), which is teared to pieces. The use of steel plates is therefore forbidden in certain territorial waters.


Alternative materials such as cardboard, heat shrink plastic etc. have been unsuccessfully tested so far. The materials fail either with regard to minimal required mechanical strength and density or they do not satisfy the environmental requirements.


The conducted tests have also shown that it takes relatively   longs time to r à C- these a tf'I n   tive formoc,rks.     


Anotner example of the submerged construction, where the formwork according to the present invention can advantageously be used, are concrete cast pier walls, bridge pillars etc. The normally applied wooden formworks are quite often not removed after solidification of the cast members because of the costs attended with mechanical removal of formworks, especially in deep waters.


The formworks attached to coated constructions hide possible casting defects, represent obstacles for later visual controls of the wearing rate of the constructions and environmental pollution by possible spontaneous self-release of formwork parts.


It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a new type of formwork, which ensure a speedy and controlled corrosion process of the formwork material, so that the formwork is
