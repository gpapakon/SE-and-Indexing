<ABSTRACT>
They apply to presses having multiple cylinders 
with combined fluid-dynamic actuating pistons for forcing 

the aluminium inside the die; the improvements are 
characterized in that the multiple cylinders comprise at 

least two coaxial chambers or cylinders (2,3) for the 
corresponding pistons (6,7), said pistons being arranged 

in tandem on a common shaft (5) which passes through both 
chambers (2,3) and which is connected by its protruding 

end (8) to the impeller actually forcing the aluminium 
inside the mould. 
They provide a pressure multiplier system of 
simple construction, small volume and high efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in 
the impulsion cylinders of aluminium extrusion presses, by 
the application of which the construction of such 
cylinders is simplified significantly, and so is that of 
the extrusion press in general, giving rise to a 
considerable reduction in the total volume of the machine 
and a large energy saving in its operation. As is well known, aluminium extrusion presses 
force the aluminium, which has a suitable degree of 
fluidity, by exerting pressure with at least one cylinder, 
generally fluid-dynamic (hydraulic or the like), the 
external end of whose rod is joined to the actual impeller 
which forces the aluminium inside the die. The problem arising in this type of press is 
always related to the power or pressure which is necessary 
for the correct impulsion of the aluminium, forcing 
constructors to provide the press with secondary cylinders 
for high speeds, complementary to the master cylinder, in 
order to add forces and achieve the pressure and speed 
which are necessary for correct operation. Nevertheless, this arrangement of independent 
cylinders implies the construction of independent casings 
for each of them, which means the machine must have a 
large volume, and at the same time complicates to a large 
extent the supply of actuating fluid, in particular when 
it is considered that all of the cylinders, both the 
master one and the secondary or complementary ones, have 
to be of the double-acting type and as such supplied by 
double pressure and return circuits.  Another disadvantage of this type of multiple 
cylinder arrangement arises from the difficulty in 
achieving accurate synchronization between the movements 
of each of the cylinders, leading to uncertainty regarding 
correct operation. The improvements which form the object of the 
present invention therefore relate to presses provided 
with multiple cylinders and tend to alleviate the 
drawbacks indicated above, providing a pressure multiplier 
system which is simple and small in volume but has high 
efficency. To this end, the improvements are characterized 
in that the multiple cylinders comprise at least two 
actual chambers or cylinders, which are coaxial, for the 
corresponding pistons, said pistons being arranged in 
tandem on a common shaft which passes through both 
chambers and which is connected outside said chambers to 
the actual impeller which forces the aluminium inside the 
mould, said mould being of conventional construction and 
not affecting the present invention.

<CLAIMS>
Improvements in the cylinders for aluminium 
extrusion presses which comprise multiple cylinders with 

combined fluid-dynamic actuating pistons for forcing the 
aluminium inside the die, characterized in that the 

multiple cylinders comprise at least two coaxial chambers 
or cylinders (2,3) for the corresponding pistons (6,7), 

said pistons being arranged in tandem on a common shaft 
(5) which passes through both chambers (2,3) and which is 

connected by its protruding end (8) to the impeller 
actually forcing the aluminium inside the mould. 
Improvements according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the cylinder (2) corresponding to 

the first piston (6) has a greater diameter and is of the 
single-acting type, to which end a port (9) for the inlet 

and discharge of actuating fluid is provided in said 
chamber (2) behind the piston (6), whilst the other 

chamber or chambers (3) are smaller in diameter and are of 
the double-acting type, such that they, and in particular 

the last of them, are provided with two independent ports 
(10,11), both for the inlet under pressure and discharge 

of said fluid, for the same purpose. 
Improvements according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the cylinder has only two chambers 

(2,3) of the type described, of different diameters, one 
having an inlet and discharge port behind the piston of 

greater diameter (6) and the other having ports (10,11) 
respectively arranged in front of and behind the 

corresponding piston of smaller diameter (7). 
Improvements according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the double cylinder (1) is 

hydraulically actuated and the coaxial shaft (5) comprises 
two sections (5a,5b) which have also different diameters 

in each of the chambers (2,3), depending on the pressure 
in each of them.
