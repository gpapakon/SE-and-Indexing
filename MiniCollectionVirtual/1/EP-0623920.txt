<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related with an optical disc,
an apparatus for reproducing the optical disc, and a method of
recording and reproducing the optical disc.There is an apparatus for reproducing an optical disc
shown in FIG. 9.In FIG. 9, when music and image information is recorded
on an optical disc 92, the information is converted into a
signal, which parameter is a pit length of an information pit
91 on an information recording surface 95. When the optical
disc 92 is reproduced, the reproducing apparatus irradiates a
laser light onto the information pit 91 to form a laser beam
light spot LS having a predetermined diameter, detects the
diffracted and reflected light by a light detector, which
consists of a photodiode etc., and outputs it as an electric
signal. Then, the reproducing apparatus extracts the recorded
music and image information out of this electric signal by
applying a signal conversion process contrary to the process
at the time of recording, and outputs it. The compact disc
(CD), the laser video disc (LVD) etc. are known as such an
optical disc. In FIG. 9, a reference numeral 93 represents a 
substrate, which consists of polycarbonate resin etc., and a
reference numeral 94 represents a protection layer.As mentioned above, the signal is read out by use of
the change in the reflected light quantity depending on the
existence of the pit at the time of scanning the optical beam
on the optical disc.In such an optical disc, the information recording
density is greatly influenced by the value of a track pitch P1
i.e. the interval between adjacent turns of the track each of
which is a center line of the pit array of the information pit
91 as shown in FIG. 10, and the value of the diameter of the
beam spot LS of the laser light irradiated onto the information
pit 91.Therefore, it may be proposed to narrow or reduce the
value of the track pitch from the above explained value of FIG.
10, in order to record more information on the optical disc.However, although there arises no problem in case of
the examples shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, if the track pitch is
reduced to be the value P2 which is less than the value P1 of
FIG. 10 (for example, P2 = P1/2) as shown in FIG. 11, for
example, information pits 91B and 91C on the neighboring tracks
other than the track of the information pit 91A to be read, are
included within the range of the beam spot LS of the laser
light. Therefore, without any countermeasure, the crosstalk
quantity increases, and it cannot be practically used. Thus,
in order to
