<ABSTRACT>
A region of the PspA protein of the Rxl strain of 
protection-eliciting eptiopes which are cross-reactive with 

PspAs of other 
S. pneumoniae
 strains. The region comprises 
the 68 amino acid sequence extending from amino acid residues 

192 to 260 of the Rx1 PspA strain.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to protein fragments containing 
epitopic regions of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), the 
major virulence factor of Streptococcuspneumoniae. Streptococcuspneumoniae is an important cause of otitis 
media, meningitis, bacteremia and pneumonia. Despite the use 
of antibiotics and vaccines, the prevalence of pneumococcal 
infections has declined little over the last twenty-five 
years. It is generally accepted that immunity to Streptococcus 
pneumoniae can be mediated by specific antibodies against the 
polysaccharide capsule of the pneumococcus. However, neonates 
and young children fail to make an immune response against 
polysaccharide antigens and can have repeated infections 
involving the same capsular serotype. One approach to immunising infants against a number of 
encapsulated bacteria is to conjugate the capsular polysaccharide 
antigens to proteins to make them immunogenic. 
This approach has been successful, for example, with 
Haemophilus influenzae b (see U.S. Patent No. 4,496,538 to 
Gordon and U.S. Patent No. 4,673,574 to Anderson). However, 
there are over eighty known capsular serotypes of 
S. pneumoniae of which twenty-three account for most of the 
disease. For a pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate 
to be successful, the capsular types responsible for most 
pneumococcal infections would have to be made adequately 
immunogenic. This approach may be difficult, because the 
twenty-three polysaccharides included in the presently-available 
vaccine are not all adequately immunogenic, even in 
adults. Furthermore, such a vaccine would probably be much 
more expensive to produce than any of the other childhood 
vaccines in routine use. An alternative approach for protecting children, and 
also the elderly, from pneumococcal infection would be to  
 
identify protein antigens that could elicit protective immune 
responses. Such proteins may serve as a vaccine by 
themselves, may be used in conjunction with successful 
polysaccharide-protein conjugates, or as carriers for 
polysaccharides. In McDaniel et al (I), J. Exp. Med. 160:386-397, 1984, 
there is described the production of hybridoma antibodies that 
recognize cell surface proteins on S. pneumoniae and 
protection of mice from infection with certain strains of 
encapsulated pneumococci by such antibodies. This surface 
protein antigen has been termed "pneumococcal surface protein 
A" or PspA for short. In McDaniel et al (II), Microbial Pathogenesis 1:519-531, 
1986, there are described studies on the
