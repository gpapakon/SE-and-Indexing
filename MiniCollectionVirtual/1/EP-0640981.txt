<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor synchronous dynamic random access 
memory device is responsive to a clock signal (CLK) and a 

clock enable signal (CKE) for selectively carrying out 
internal sequences such as a read-out sequence, a write-in 

sequence and a self-refreshing sequence, and a signal input 
unit (16j) assigned to the clock enable signal has a 

complementary logic gate type signal input circuit (16n) 
enabled in a self-refreshing sequence for receiving the 

clock enable signal and a current-mirror type signal input 
circuit (16m) enabled in other sequences for receiving the 

clock enable signal so that the current consumption of the 
signal input unit is decreased during the self-refreshing 

sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated
circuit device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor
integrated circuit device having a low-power consumption
signal input circuit for receiving a high-speed small-amplitude
input signal.The signal input circuit of the semiconductor
integrated circuit device is expected to serve as an
interface between internal circuits and other semiconductor
integrated circuit devices implemented by TTL (Transistor-Transistor-Logic)
circuits and/or CMOS (Complementary
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) circuits, and the basic
requirements for the signal input circuit are large margin
in sensitivity, high-speed response to an input signal,
low-power consumption, simplicity and small occupation
space.The prior art signal input circuits are largely
categorized in two groups, and the first group is
implemented by CMOS circuits. Two examples are illustrated 
in figure 1 and 2 of the drawings, and are enabled with an
enable signal EBL1 for responding to an input signal Sin.
In the following description, a high voltage level and a
low voltage level are assumed to be corresponding to logic
"1" level and logic "0" level, respectively.The first prior art signal input circuit shown in
figure 1 comprises a series combination of a p-channel
enhancement type switching transistor Qp1 and n-channel
enhancement type switching transistors Qn2 and Qn3 coupled
between a positive power voltage line Vdd and a ground
voltage line GND, an n-channel enhancement type protective
transistor Qn4 coupled between an input signal node IN and
the gate electrode of the n-channel enhancement type
switching transistor Qn2, a p-channel enhancement type load
transistor Qp5 coupled between the positive power voltage
line Vdd and the common drain node N1 in the series
combination and two output inverters INV1 and INV2 coupled
to the drain node N2 of the p-channel enhancement type load
transistor Qp5 for producing an output signal Sout. The
input signal Sin is supplied to the gate electrode of the
p-channel enhancement type switching transistor Qp1 and
through the n-channel enhancement type protective
transistor Qn4 to the gate electrode of the n-channel 
enhancement type switching transistor Qn2. The enable
signal EBL1 is supplied through a control node CTL to the
gate electrode of the n-channel enhancement type switching
transistor Qn3 and the gate electrode of the p-channel
enhancement type load transistor Qp5.While the enable signal EBL is maintained at the low
voltage level, the n-channel enhancement
