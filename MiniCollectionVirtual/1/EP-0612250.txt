<ABSTRACT>
The present disclosure relates to selected antigenic proteins obtained from the outer membranes of Moraxella catarrhalis, that are found to have a variety of useful properties. These proteins, termed OMPs ("Outer Membrane Proteins"), are characterized as having molecular weights of about 30 kD, 80kD and between about 200 and 700 kD, respectively. Studies set forth herein demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies directed against these proteins confer a protective effect against infection by Moraxella catarrhalis organisms in animal models, demonstrating the potential usefulness of such antibodies in conferring passive immunity as well as the potential usefulness of these OMPs, or variants thereof, in the preparation of vaccines. Also disclosed are DNA segments encoding these OMPs, methods for preparing the antigens, or variants, through the application of recombinant DNA techniques, as well as diagnostic methods and embodiments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to various 
outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Moraxella catarrhalis 
which have been found by the inventors to be useful 
targets in immunotherapy, such as in the preparation of 
vaccines or protective antibodies for use in treatment of 
Moraxella catarrhalis-related diseases. In particular 
aspects, the present invention concerns antigens 
identified by molecular weights of about 30 kD, 80 kD and 
a third antigen, termed "high molecular weight protein" 
or "HMWP" antigen having a molecular weight of between 
about 200 and 700 kD, as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis. In other aspects, the invention 
concerns recombinant clones encoding these antigens, 
antigen fragments derived therefrom, equivalents thereof, 
as well as to antibodies reactive with these species. 
Further, the invention concerns methods for the detection 
of Moraxella catarrhalis antigens and antibodies, as well 
as the use of specific antigens and antibodies both in 
passive and active immunity against Moraxella catarrhalis 
infections. It was previously thought that Moraxella catarrhalis 
(previously known as Branhamella catarrhalis or Neisseria 
catarrhalis) was a harmless saprophyte of the upper 
respiratory tract. However, during the previous decade, 
it has been determined that this organism is an important  
 
human pathogen. In fact, recent studies have established 
this Gram-negative diplococcus as the cause of a number 
of human infections (Murphy, 1989). For example, 
Moraxella catarrhalis is a leading cause of otitis media, 
acute maxillary sinusitis as well as generalized 
infections of the lower respiratory tract (see, e.g., 
Murphy et al., 1989). Studies have established that the 
incidence of otitis media and sinusitis attributed to 
Moraxella catarrhalis infections is increasing, with it 
being about the third most common causative organism. In 
fact, reports have identified otitis media as the most 
common disease for which infants and children receive 
health care (Consensus, 1989). The "Consensus" report referred to above concluded 
that prevention of otitis media is an important health 
care goal due to both its occurrence in infants and 
children, as well as certain populations of all age 
groups. In fact, the total financial burden of otitis 
media has been estimated to be at least 2.5 billion 
annually, or approximately 3% of the health care budget. 
Vaccines were identified as the most desired approach to 
the prevention of this disease for a number of
