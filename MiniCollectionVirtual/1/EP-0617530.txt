<ABSTRACT>
Interconnection memory comprising an array of 
dual-port switching memories used as first-in, first-out 

devices, characterized in that each dual-port memory (3,4) 
of the memory array includes a write-only port (15,23) 

and a read-only port (18,19,20,21) having separate 
address and control signals. 

The write port of each dual-port memory comprises an input buffer (15), 

connected bit by bit to a data input bus (34), separate write bit lines 
(32,33) for each bit of the dual-port memory, connected between the 

input buffer (15) and the memory elements (30) of the bit of the memory, 
a column selection circuit (35) connected to the input buffers of each 

row of dual-port memories by write enable lines for delivering, to the 
write buffers, corresponding write enable (WE) signals, which are 

separate for each buffer per each row and a decoder and write address 
command circuit (23) common to each row of dual-port memories, intended 

for decoding the row addresses and for selecting the corresponding word 
line in all the dual-port memories from a row of the memory array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the transmission
of data and refers more particularly to the transmission
of data between telecommunications terminals operating at
different frequencies.Applications in the field of telecommunications
and informatics are tending ever more to the use of a
standard with asynchronous transfer mode ATM for transferring
data between terminals. In general, the sender
and the receiver operate at different frequencies. The
key element of an asynchronous transfer mode ATM is the
switching array which establishes the connection and
synchronizes the sender with the receiver.A two-dimensional switching array of the aforesaid
type connects input data originating from senders
each operating at a different frequency to outputs
connected to receivers each operating at a different
frequency from that of the sender with which it is
communicating.The switching array therefore has two principal
functions:
a) to establish one or more connections between
terminals, andb) to match the frequency of the data transmitted.The switching element operates as a first-in,
first-out FIFO device.The clock signal which determines the rate of the
input signals originating from a first sender controls
the storage of these input data at the address defined by
a write address pointer. The clock frequency depends on
the frequency of the input data originating from the
first sender and increments the address pointer.A clock signal corresponding to the frequency of
the output data controls the read cycle of the FIFO. A
read address pointer selects a datum in the FIFO. The
read datum appears on the output connected to the corresponding
receiver. The clock signal corresponding to the
frequency of the output data controls the incrementation
of an address read register. The size of the FIFO device 
depends on the difference in frequency between the input
and the output of the data and on the number of information
items to be transmitted.The write and read pointers operate under cyclic
addressing. When the address of one or the other of the
pointers is at the bottom at the FIFO register, the next
address is at the top of the FIFO register. Equality
between the write and read address pointers establishes
the clear signal.When the read pointer catches up with the write
pointer, when there is equality between the two pointers,
the buffer is clear. When the write pointer catches up
with the read pointer, the buffer is full.The write cycle corresponding to the equality of
the pointers is disabled.A conventional switching
