<ABSTRACT>
The pallet container (1) for liquids has an exchangeable inner container (2) made of sheet metal, an outer casing (6) of latticework and a pallet (9) which is designed as a bottom tray (10) and receives the bottom (16), designed as a drainage bottom, of the inner container in a positive-locking manner. The inner container (2) of sheet metal, preferably of dual-walled design, is welded together from a casing (11), a bottom part (12) and a lid (13). To produce the inner container, a rectangular sheet-metal blank is bent to form a tubular body whose abutting edges are welded longitudinally. The tubular body is stretched to form a casing of rectangular cross-section. A circumferential bead with a V-shaped cross-section is then moulded in each case into the two end regions of the casing with spacing from its edges which are subsequently trimmed. The deep-drawn, tray-shaped bottom part is then fitted precisely with a bent edge onto or attached to the outer flank of the one bead of the casing, and the bottom part is fixed to the casing. The lid is mounted on the casing in the same manner. The bottom part and the lid are welded to the casing. To form a smooth transition between the casing and bottom part on the one hand and the casing and lid on the other hand, the transition regions between the casing and the bottom part and the casing and the lid are widened by applying pressure to the inner container inserted in a supporting mould.

A method of making single and double wall inner containers (2) of steel sheet or a sheet consisting of an 
inner sheet (14) of corrosion-resistant stainless steel and an outer sheet (15) of ordinary steel, for pallet 

containers (1) with an outer mesh jacket (6) of metal, a bottom tray (10) of sheet metal formed as a 
pallet (9) to receive the inner container (2) mating therein, and a pallet frame (29) of metal, wood or 

plastics material for supporting the bottom tray (10), characterized by the following method steps: 

a) bending a rectangular piece of sheet metal of the kind of sheet recited above into a tubular 
body (33); 
b) longitudinally welding the abutting edges (33a, 33b) of the tubular body (33); 
c) stretching the tubular body (33) into a jacket (11) with a rectangular or square cross-section; 
d) indenting a peripheral corrugation (40, 41) with a V-cross-section in each of the two end 
regions of the jacket (11), spaced from its edges (11a, 11b); 
e) cutting off to size the two outer edge strips (11c, 11d) of the jacket (11) adjoining the 
corrugations (40, 41); 
f) snugly fitting the deep-drawn, tray-shaped bottom part (12) with an out-turned edge (42) on 
to or against the outer flank (40a) of the one corrugation (40) of the jacket (11) and 

fastening the bottom part (12) to the jacket (11); 
g) snugly fitting the deep-drawn cover (13) with an out-turned edge (43) on to or against the 
outer flank (41a) of the other corrugation (41) of the jacket (11) and fastening the cover (13) 

to the jacket (11); 
h) welding the bottom part (12) and cover (13) liquid tight to the jacket (11); 
i) turning the edge strips (11c, 11d) of the container jacket (11) projecting beyond the turned 
out edges (42, 43) of the bottom part (12) and the cover (13) over the turned out bottom 

edge (42) and cover edge (43) and pressing together the gap (44) formed by the outer flanks 
(40a, 41a) of the corrugations (40, 41) in the jacket (11) and the edge strips (11c, 11d) for 

reception of the bottom and cover edges (42 and 43); 
j) widening out the inner transition regions (47) between the jacket (11) and the bottom part 
and between the jacket (11) and the cover (13) of the container (2) placed in a supporting 

mould (46) to remove the annular gaps (45) formed between the jacket (11) and bottom part 
(11) and between the jacket (11) and cover (13), by pressurising the container (2) and 
k) testing the tightness of the container (2) under internal pressure.
