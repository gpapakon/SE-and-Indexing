<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methine compounds
and silver halide photographic materials containing the
compound.Recently, rapid processing of silver halide
photographic materials to form photographic images is
desired. However, rapid processing is often unfavorable
to photographic materials. When photographic materials
are processed rapidly, it becomes impossible to ensure a
sufficient time necessary for decoloring the dyes or the
sensitizing or desensitizing dyes contained in the
photographic materials or for removing them from the
materials, with the result that the processed photographic
materials have noticeable residual color resulting from
the dyes or sensitizing or desensitizing dyes remained
therein.Heretofore, various improvements have been made
for overcoming the problem. For instance, it has been
proposed to use water-soluble dyes or to improve
processing solutions to be used, so as to elevate the
decoloring rate. Various methods are known for reducing 
residual color in processed photographic materials. For
instance, there are described (1) a method of adding a
water-soluble stilbene compound, a nonionic surfactant or
a mixture of them to a developer, (2) a method of treating
the photographic element that has been bleached and fixed
with an oxidizing agent so as to decompose the dyes in the
element, and (3) a method of using a bleaching bath
containing persulfuric acid, in Research Disclosure, Vol.
207, No. 20733 (July, 1981). However, these methods are
insufficient when the degree of residual color is great.
In addition, since these methods could not positively
promote the step of decoloring and removing sensitizing
dyes, they are not suitable for decoloration of the dyes
in rapid processing.
EP-A-534283 and EP-A-530511 both relate to photographic
materials having reduced residual colour and high sensitivity,
wherein the materials comprise a methine dye.One subject matter of the present invention is to
provide novel methine compounds.Another subject matter of the present invention is
to provide silver halide photographic materials which may
be processed to have less residual color, while having
satisfactory photographic properties such as sensitivity.These subject matters of the present invention
have been attained by
the methine compound of formula (1) and by
a silver halide photographic
material containing at least one compound of the
following formula (1): 
(DYE)(G-)nwhere DYE represents a methine dye residue;G- represents a substituent for the methine dye
