<ABSTRACT>
The method includes extruding the pasta filata cheese in form of a cord (2) that is left hanging up to a belt (7) operated at a speed higher than the speed of the coming out of the cord (2) from said extruding means (1), so as to cause a stretching in the free strap of the cord comprised between the extruding means (1) and the transport belt (7). The stretched ribbon (2) is then transversally severed in single portions (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention lies in the technical field 
concerning the production of pasta filata cheese, such 
as mozzarella and the like. It is known that various types of pasta filata cheese 
are presently produced in form of a cord from which 
single portions are severed. In order to obtain such cord, the cheese paste going 
out of the moulding machine is let into a hopper. The cord that is then delivered from the hopper is 
subjected to manual tug that provokes a stretching of 
the same paste. Obviously, such manual processing brings to various 
inconveniences as far as hygiene and productivity. In order to overcome such disadvantages many 
apparatuses are known for carrying out stretching of 
the cheese cord by means of proper rolls (see 
JP-57-206334). The document US-A-4 288 465 discloses a method and an 
apparatus suitable for shaping pasta filata cheese  
 
comprising the steps of extruding pasta filata cheese 
trought extruding means in order to obtain a strand of 
cheese which is brought to a pair of adjacent, 
rotating drums, around which the cheese strand is 
wrapped, which are operated at a speed higher than the 
extrusion speed in a way to cause the strand stretch. The strand then passes down a cooling vat under 
tension and, after its pulling and cooling, it is cut 
in lengths suitable for packaging. The above apparatus provides effective means 
suitable for controlling automatically the tension 
applied to the stretched strand, except that the 
speed of the drums could be controlled by the 
adjustable power supply of the motor of the same 
drums. The mentioned apparatuses have not resolved in a fully 
effective way the problems connected with shaping  
 
pasta filata cheese into form of cord. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method that allows to obtain automatically stretched 
cords of pasta filata cheese. The object is obtained by means of a method for 
shaping pasta filata cheese into form of cords, which 
includes the following steps: 
extruding pasta filata cheese through extruding means, 
in a way to obtain at least one cord of pasta filata 
cheese; bringing said pasta filata cord hanging up to 
transport means that are operated at a speed higher 
than the coming out speed of the same cord from said 
extruding means, in a way to cause a stretching in the 
free strap of said cord located between said extruding 
means and said transport means, as well as in the 
cord section situated on said transport means; transversal cuttting in single portions of said 
stretched

<CLAIMS>
Method for shaping pasta filata cheese into form of 
cords, including: 


extruding pasta filata cheese through extruding means 
(1), in a way to obtain at least one cord (2) of pasta 

filata cheese; 
bringing said pasta filata cord (2) suspended to 
transport means (7) that are operated at a speed 

higher than the coming out speed of the same cord (2) 
from said extruding means (1), in a way to cause a 

stretching in the free length of said cord (2) located 
between said extruding means (1) and said transport 

means (7), as well as in the cord section situated on 
said transport means (7); 
transversal cutting in single portions (18) of said 
stretched pasta filata cord (2); 
said method 
characterized in that
 said free length of 
pasta filata cord (2) is curved downardly, due to 

gravity, so as to describe an inverted camber that is detected 
by means (14), the length of such inverted camber giving an 

indirect measure of the said stretching, this 
stretching being varied by adjusting the operating 

speed of said transport means (7) and/or of said 
extruding means (1). 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the stretching of the pasta filata cheese cord (2) is 

obtained in correspondence with said transport means 
(7) by providing said transport means being 

constituted by a transport belt formed by a continuous 
series of segments (9) equipped with grooved blocks  

 
(10) defining a throat (11) designed to receive and 

carry the cited pasta filata cord (2). 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
at the outlet of said transport means (7), said cord 

(2) falls onto a further transport belt (15) that is 
partially dipped in a basin (16) for cheese 

pre-hardening. 
Method according claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it 
includes measuring the pressure of the cheese paste 

inside said extruding means (1) and accordingly adjust 
the operation speed of said extruding means (1), so as 

to maintain constant the extruding pressure of said 
cheese paste.
