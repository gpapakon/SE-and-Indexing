<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiating structure with microstrip technology for an array antenna, comprising a plurality of unconnected and not necessarily identical radiating elements, distributed over an insulating surface and comprising electromagnetic means for exciting these radiating elements. These elements are excited by distribution of the electromagnetic excitation energy, and the structure of the invention is characterized in that the distribution is performed by coupling of the magnetic currents generated by each element when it is excited. According to one advantageous embodiment, the elements are arranged in such a way as to obtain a phase and amplitude condition on the surface; in effect, the best directivity is obtained when the illumination is equi-phase and equi-amplitude on the surface. The invention also relates to an antenna including the radiating structure, when installed on a planar surface or a surface shaped in three dimensions.
