<ABSTRACT>
MODULAR SUPPORT HOUSING FOR ELECTRIC UNITS, which is a rigid piece made of "zamak" light alloy, obtained by moulding under pressure to a regular quadrangular format and with equal, symmetric sides, with rebated corners or junctions, and the outer edges of which essentially have protruding parts and rebated parts, staggered in the same format and dimensions, which are complementary and inversely connectable by lateral assembly, by any one of their sides. This is a housing for electrical mechanisms or appliances which can be combined together, for horizontal or vertical projection, or intersected horizontal and vertical projections.

Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, constituted 
by a single modular frame (1) comprising a frame (2) for assembling 

electrical mechanisms, complementary means for fixing (8), coupling (3) 

and centering (17) control push buttons or keys and fixing (6-6a) 
decorative frames, in the form of a piece composed of a rigid, regular 

quadrangular frame (1) defined by four symmetrical sides (9, 10, 11, 12) 
bereft of junctions and projecting angles (13), characterized in that the 

sides (9, 10, 11, 12) are provided with stepped assembly means 
(14, 15-16, 17) adapted to be imbricated (10-20a-21-21a) equal to one 

another, in clockwise direction and comple-mentary in two's, along the 
opposite sides (9, 11 and 10, 12) of the frame (1) and composed of a 

vertical section equivalent to half the thickness of the respective 
symmetrical side. 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus according 
to the preceding Claim, characterized in that the assembly means are 

constituted by alternate central and end projecting means, at the top (14-15) 
and at the bottom (16-17), separated solely by an intermediate bearing 

projection (7), and in that the top central projecting means (14) and the 
bottom one (17) have a re-entrant part or angular embedding (20)(21a) 

and the top end projecting means (15) and bottom ones (16) have a re-entrant 
part or angular embedding (21) (20a) on the inside. 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus according 
to Claim 2, characterized in that the projecting assembly means (14-15) 

(16-17) are alternately stepped projections (14-15) with an embedding 
space (19) at the top and other stepped projections (16-17) with an 

embedding space at the bottom (18). 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, which 
comprises assembly means according to Claims 2 and 3, characterized in  

 
that the upper projecting means (14-15), the lower projecting means (16-17) 

and the spaces (18-19) all have the same dimensions, both in length 
and in width, depth, except for the tolerances for adjustment. 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, which 
comprises upper projecting means (14-15) and stepped lower projecting 

means (16-17), according to any one of Claims 2 to 4, characterized in 
that the vertical section thereof presents an exact thickness on all the sides 

(9) (10) (11) and (12) of the rigid frame (1). 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, which 
comprises alternating assembly means according to any one of Claims 1 to 

5, characterized in that it comprises fitting means (22) and (23) in dovetail 
form, respectively fittable in vertical projection and, optionally, 

provided on each side with chamfers or bevels (24-25) for fitting. 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, consisting 
of a frame (1) bereft of projecting angles, according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that the corners are concave re-entrant angles (13). 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, comprising 
in complementary manner means (7) for bearing and centering the keys 

or push buttons, according to Claim 1, characterized in that they are 
irregular poly-gonal projections emerging perpendicularly to the edge of 

each side of the frame (9 to 12), disposed symmetrically, as a spider. 
Multicombinable support frame for electrical apparatus, which 
comprises means (6) for fixing the decorative frames, according to 

Claim 1, characterized in that the fixing means (6) are constituted by 
cylindrical studs cone-formed with reversed projection, abutting against 

and tangential to the edges of the concentric flange (5) of the electrical 
mechanism-bearing frame (2), and presenting a peripheral notch or cut 

(6a) near the upper base of the stud (6).
