<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wetting apparatus
and method of wetting for an offset printing machines. US 4 944 223 discloses a mechanism for continously supplying a dampening medium in an
offset printing machine. The mechanism includes a dampening medium applicator roller in
rotation contact with a master plate on a master cylinder, a damping medium transfer roller
in rotational contact with the applicator roller, a dampening medium distributor roller in
rotational contact with the transfer roller, a dipping roller in rotational contact with the
distributor roller, and a metering roller in contact with the dipping roller.
The applicator roller and the transfer roller have their outer peripheral surface provided with
elastic material layers. A lithography offset plate comprises hydrophilic
portions and chemically treated ink-wettable portions, and
a film of a dampening solution has to be held properly on
the hydrophilic portions for favorable printing results.
Generally, a dampening solution is fed to the printing surface
and then a film of ink is applied from an ink application
roller to the printing surface. At that time, the
dampening solution on the printing surface mixes with the
ink on the ink application roller. This mixing will hereinafter
be referred to as "emulsification". When the ink
application roller rotates and comes again in contact with
the printing surface, the mixed solution on the roller is
discharged as dampening solution on the printing surface,
the hydrophilic portion is supplemented, and printing is
performed. This discharge from the ink application roller
will hereinafter be referred to as "emulsion breaking".A continuous wetting apparatus has been used widely,
since it provides relatively superior printing quality and
its maintenance easier than apparatuses incorporating other 
methods, such as a brush method and a spray method. The
continuous wetting apparatus is grouped into three types:
printing surface wetting type, ink application roller
wetting type, and combination type of these.Among these types, in the continuous wetting apparatus
of the printing surface wetting type, a dampening
solution is fed directly to a printing surface 9 by a
series of rollers 2, 3 and 4, shown in Fig. 5(a). In the
ink application roller wetting type apparatus, as shown in
Fig. 5(b), a dampening solution is fed to one of the rollers
in an ink supply device (e.g., an ink application
roller 7) and not to the printing surface 9, and the hydrophilic
portion of the printing surface 9 is wetted
