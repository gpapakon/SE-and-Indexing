<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a cervical pillow for stabilized placement of
the head and neck of a person when in a generally horizontal position, said
cervical pillow having a longitudinal horizontal axis corresponding to the
person's longitudinal axis and a horizontal transverse axis and comprising
an upper multi-density foam portion having a top, a bottom face, first and
second end faces orthogonal to said transverse axis and a convoluted
support surface disposed across the top; and further comprising a
removable base portion vertically matable with the bottom face of the multi-density
foam portion by mutually interlocking topographies of the bottom
face of the multi-density foam portion and of an upper face of the base
portion, said mutually interlocking topographies permitting separation of the
multi-density foam portion and the base portion to provide selectable
adjustment of overall vertical height of the support face. Research shows that sleep comfort is directly related
to sleep posture. Entire industries have developed around the
manufacture of alternative bed constructions, each one offering
various features directed to achieving a good night's sleep.
Posture beds, water beds, spring beds, futons and inclining
beds, to name only a few, all offer unite characteristics.
The user can select the type of bed construction which best
complements their sleep preferences and anatomical build. Most
people fail to understand, however, that a pillow can affect
sleep comfort as much as, if not more than, the bed.Unfortunately, most conventional pillows do not offer
proper anatomical support and alignment of the head and
cervical spine (neck) nor do they offer any adjustability to
tailor the support to the particular anatomical characteristics
of the user or variations of the sleeping surface. Although
one can select a pillow from a wide range of firmnesses and
materials, generally pillows are only offered as a one-size-fits-all
configuration. The fact is that the build of a
specialized athlete, such as a football or rugby player, is
quite different than a child or a senior citizen. Shoulder
width, head size and neck size can vary enormously between
individuals. A pillow which provides proper support and height
to a head of a small child sleeping on her side would most
certainly not provide proper support or height for a muscular 
male athlete sleeping on his side, with broad shoulder width
elevating the head a greater distance from the sleeping
surface. Likewise, some individuals like to sleep on their

of said transverse axis - located in a middle area of the length of said 

pillow (2) along said longitudinal axis and in an intermediate area of
the height of said multi-density foam portion (4,6,34) along a vertical

axis of said pillow (2), with foam of said multi-density foam portion
(4,6,34) underlying the hollow cut-out (28) to separate it from the

the thickness providing additional adjustment of overall vertical

height of the support face (10).
The cervical pillow (2) of one of the claims 1 to 5 wherein the
convoluted support surface (10) includes a plurality of generally

upwardly extending protrusions (14), the protrusions (14) each
having a foot (68) and a tip (66), the foot (68) having a different

foam density than the foam density of the tip (66).
The cervical pillow (2) of one of the claims 1 to 6 further comprising
a cover (76) configured to generally encase the pillow (2), a pocket

(78) secured to the cover (76) and a removable supplemental 
member (82) positionable in said pocket (78).
