<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) for testing one or more circuit boards (12₁-12
n
), each containing at 
least one chain of Boundary-Scan cells (14₁-14
p
), includes a system test and 
diagnosis host (16) for managing overall testing of the system formed by the circuit 

boards. A Boundary-Scan Virtual Machine (BVM) (17) is operative to receive an 
initiate test command from the system test and diagnosis host independent of the 

number and nature of the boards to be tested. In response to the test command, the 
BVM (17) causes each circuit board to execute a test program (23) specific thereto to 

determine the errors, if any, in the board. The errors from each board are passed 
back to the BVM (17) which, in turn, interprets the errors to yield test information, 

indicative of the operation of the boards, which is then passed back to the system test 
and diagnosis host (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for testing one or
more circuit boards in a system wherein each board contains a plurality of
Boundary-Scan-testable electronic components coupled to each other.Traditionally, circuit boards have been tested via a bed-of-nails test
fixture to detect faults, such as a failed connection between a node (i.e., a pin) of one
component (e.g., an integrated circuit) on the board and a node of another component
on the same board. As the density of components on a circuit board has increased,
testing via the traditional bed-of-nails fixture has become increasingly more difficult
to perform because of a reduced access to the nodes of the components on the board.
For this reason, many circuit boards are now being designed with a Boundary-Scan
test architecture of the type set forth in the ANSI/IEEE Standard 1149.1, Test Access
Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture.In accordance with the ANSI/IEEE Boundary-Scan architecture,
selected components on the board are each provided with one or more Boundary-Scan
cells, each comprising a single-bit register. Each Boundary-Scan cell is
coupled to a node of a component, such as an input, output, input/output or control
node. The Boundary-Scan cells are serially coupled in a single chain, usually
referred to as a Boundary-Scan chain. To accomplish Boundary-Scan testing of a
board, a string of bits is shifted through the chain of Boundary-Scan cells so that
each bit is latched in a separate cell in the chain. As the bits are shifted through the
chain of Boundary-Scan cells, each cell coupled to an output node of a component is
"updated," i.e., the bit shifted into the cell appears at the corresponding output node
coupled to it In turn, the bit appearing at an output node will be "captured" by a
Boundary-Scan cell associated with an input node of a component driven by this
output node. To check whether the connections between the Boundary-Scan-testable
components are fault-free, the bits in the chain of Boundary-Scan cells are shifted
out and compared to a bit string obtained under fault-free conditions.Boundary-Scan testing in the manner described above is controlled by
way of a Boundary-Scan Master (BSM) on each circuit board. The BSM is
comprised of a logic block that receives test information from a test and diagnosis 
host (i.e., a processor). In response to a test command from a host test and diagnosis
processor specific to the type of circuit board to be tested, the BSM on that board
accomplishes Boundary-Scan testing of
