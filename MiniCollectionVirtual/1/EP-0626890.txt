 COLD-FORMING OF TOOTHED WHEELS FROM SHEET STEEL Field of InventionThis invention relates to toothed wheels of the type utilized in motor vehicles as, for example, in the starter assembly thereof and more particularly to improvements in the method of making such toothed wheels. Background of InventionA motor vehicle usage of a mechanical part presents certain inherent' problems which are peculiar to automotive use and are not presented in other uses. Today, the weight of the part is a particular problem and there is always a desire to reduce weight to a minimum commensurate with adequate strength. An extended useful life is also a highly prized characteristic. Moreover, due to the mass production basis upon which most motor vehicles and parts are made,. the one most necessary attribute is cost-effectiveness.Toothed wheels, as herein utilized, includes starter gears, toothed timing belt pulleys, pulse rings, and the like, with particular emphasis on starter gears.Conventional practice in the manufacture of starter gears is to form an annular body from sheet metal by suitable cold-forming, as, for example, stamping and the like, which annular body provides the central wall of the gear and includes a peripheral configuration suitable to receive a separate ring gear. The ring gear is made from a ring of metal of rectangular cross-sectional configuration with the teeth being conventionally machined by a metal removal process. The starter gear is completed by spot-welding the ring gear to the peripheral configuration of the sheet metal body. The resultant construction while providing adequate service life is somewhat heavy and somewhat costly to manufacture. It has long been known that substantial manufacturing cost and weight savings could be achieved if a satisfactory gear could be fabricated from a single piece of sheet metal by moving the sheet metal into the final configuration using cold- forming techniques. The so-called "Grob" machine has been available for some time which is operable to hammer in gear teeth or, more particularly, to hammer materialSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

in an annular blank radially inwardly to form the space between teeth on an indexed basis.' Indeed, the patented literature contains proposals for making motor vehicle starter gears utilizing the Grob technique and machinery. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,796,345 discloses a method of making a starter gear which includes forming a preform from a circular piece of sheet metal by cold-forming an axial flange on the outer periphery of a

 is cold-formed into said series of teeth, the peripheries of which are cold- formed by rolling contact with the tooth-forming periphery of the tooth- forming tool unit and portions of the sides of which are smooth and cold- formed by contact with said smooth tooth-side forming surface means so that an amount of sheet metal which would otherwise uncontrollably flow axially outwardly of the smooth tooth-side forming surface means is concentrated within the teeth and/or the radially inward back-up therefor.

4. A method as defined in claim 3 wherein said non-thickened preform is cold- formed into a thickened final preform while secured to said rotary holding unit with said first annular wall portion overlying said control surface means by cold-rolling the integrally interconnected outer peripheries of said two side-by-side annular wall portions radially inwardly to thicken the outer portion of the annular wall portions and the integral interconnection therebetween.
5.
