<ABSTRACT>
At least one certain primary or secondary color is 
established that receives special treatment for at least 

one printing medium. Such treatment may include (1) using 
more than two drops of primaries per pixel for binary 

printing of a particular secondary; or (2) binary-printing 
the chromatic primary or secondary -- but not other hues 

-- after rendition, by use of a "superpixel"; or (3) 
application of, in effect, a nonintegral number, greater 

than one, of ink drops per pixel; or (4) combinations of 
these treatments. As an example of the first of these 

treatments -- using inks optimized for plain paper at one 
drop of ink for primaries and two (one of each of two 

primaries) for secondaries -- red is printed on transparency 
film as one drop of yellow ink and two of magenta 

in each pixel. As to the second treatment, the superpixel 
is preferably a group of pixels (
e. g.
, a two-by-two 
array) including the target pixel, in which group each 

pixel is inked and at least one pixel receives at least 
two drops of ink. In particular -- still assuming inks 

optimized for plain paper as described above -- to print 
red on so-called "glossy media" (meaning nontransparent 

glossy media), one drop each of yellow and magenta is used 
in each of two opposite corners, and one drop of yellow 

and 
two
 drops of magenta are used in each of the remaining 
corners. Analogously, to print green on transparency 

film, one drop each of yellow and cyan is used in each of 
two opposite corners, and one drop of yellow and 
two
 drops 
of cyan are used in each of the remaining corners; and to 

print blue on transparency film one drop each of magenta 
and cyan is used in two opposite corners, and one of 

magenta and 
two
 of cyan are used in remaining corners.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to printing color
images by construction from individual ink drops deposited
in pixel arrays; and more particularly to creation of such
images by inkjet operation on a printing medium whose hue
or saturation response, or both, depart from the responses
of ordinary paper. Certain aspects of our invention are
particularly pertinent to binary printing operation, and 
even more particularly relevant in the context of three-binary-bit
color reproduction.Printing with Primaries and secondaries --
In this
well-known technology, color printing is controlled by
programmed digital microprocessors. In each apparatus one
or more processors operate pens loaded with ink of three
so-called "primary" colors -- most commonly cyan, magenta
and yellow.Printing any of these three colors is accomplished
simply by depositing ink of the desired color. So-called
"secondary" colors -- ordinarily green, blue and red --are
printed by combinations of the primaries.More specifically, printing of any one of the secondaries
(green, for example) is done by overprinting two
primaries (traditionally equal quantities of cyan and
yellow, for the same example). The secondary is created
by the subtractive process of spectral absorption.Commonly, still another pen is loaded with black ink
to provide black and gray effects. This aspect of the
printing process may not be of direct interest in regard
to the present invention and so will receive little mention
in the remainder of this document.By "binary" we refer to the well-known concept of either
having or not having a fixed unitary quantity of something.
In this context it means either printing or not
printing in each pixel location a particular primary or
secondary color -- in an essentially unvarying amount.This concept is sometimes summarized with the phrase
"go/no-go". In other words, either the system enters a
"go" mode of operation -- with respect to a particular
primary or secondary color -- in which it may be said to
"go ahead and print" some specific, fixed quantity of that 
particular color; or it enters a "no-go" mode in which it
does not print that color at all.Not all pixel-array printing systems operate in this
way. To the contrary, some systems use a multiple-level
approach, in which many different quantities of ink (of
one or several colors) can be deposited at each pixel.The point of those other systems is to establish a
multiple-level saturation scale, or -- viewed in a monochrome
sense with respect to each color independently --a
multiple-gr

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing chromatic color images on different
printing media by construction from individual ink drops

deposited in pixel arrays; said different printing media
having the property of producing respective different color

appearances in response to application of ink, even when ink
of the same colors is applied in the same quantities; said

method comprising the steps of:

receiving information about a given desired image to be
printed on a given printing medium;
through a rendition process determining for each particular
pixel, in the given desired image on the given printing

medium, a specific desired primary chromatic
color or a secondary chromatic color, being defined as a combination of primary colours,

but no other hue;
establishing at least one primary or secondary
chromatic color, but no other hue, that is to receive postrendition

superpixel treatment for at least one printing medium; and
if the specific desired primary or secondary is one which
it has been established is to receive postrendition superpixel

treatment for the given printing medium, then
performing said postrendition superpixel treatment, which comprises the substeps of:
defining a superpixel that consists of a plurality
of pixels associated with said particular pixel, and
applying to each of the pixels in that superpixel,
on the given printing medium, a respective number of

drops of ink predetermined for the desired primary or
secondary chromatic color in conjunction with the given

printing medium.
The method of claim 1, further comprising:

determining, for each medium to be used, whether the
specific desired primary or secondary chromatic color is one

which receives superpixel treatment. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the superpixel consists
of:


said particular pixel; and
at least one other nearby pixel.
The method of claim 3, wherein:

if the given printing medium is a nontransparent glossy
medium, then said first primary color is yellow and said at

least one color that receives superpixel treatment is red and
said second primary color is magenta; and
if the given printing medium is transparency film, then
said at least one color that receives superpixel treatment

comprises:

green, for which said first primary color is yellow
and said second primary color is cyan, and
blue, for which said first primary color is magenta
and said second primary color is cyan.
The method of claim 1, wherein:

each of at least one pixel of the superpixel receives a
predetermined quantity of ink of a first primary color and at

least the same quantity of ink of a second primary color; and
each of at least one other pixel of the cluster receives
substantially the same quantity of ink of the first primary

color and substantially at least twice that same quantity of
ink of said second primary color;
wherein for the superpixel considered as a unit the
average quantity of said second primary color applied is

substantially at least 1.2 times said predetermined quantity
of ink, and the average quantity of all colors applied is

substantially at least 2.2 times said predetermined quantity
of ink.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of:

establishing at least one certain primary or secondary
color that does not receive superpixel treatment for at least

one printing medium; and
if the specific desired primary or secondary is one which
it has been established does not receive superpixel treatment

for said given printing medium, then applying to that particular
pixel individually, in the given image on the given printing

medium, a number of drops of ink predetermined for the
desired primary or secondary in conjunction with the given

printing medium.
A method of printing chromatic color images by construction
from individual ink drops deposited in pixel arrays; said

method comprising the steps of:

establishing a primary
chromatic color or a secondary chromatic color, being defined as a combination of primary colours, that is printed as, on average, a nonintegral

number of ink drops per pixel, said nonintegral number being greater
than one;
receiving information about a given desired image to be
printed on a given printing medium;
determining for each particular pixel, in the given
desired image, a specific desired primary or secondary

chromatic color; and
if the specific desired primary is one which it has been

established is printed by, on average, a number of drops per pixel that
is nonintegral and greater than one, then applying to a superpixel comprising a plurality of pixels associated with that

particular pixel on average a nonintegral number, greater
than one, of drops of ink per pixel predetermined for the desired

primary or secondary chromatic color.
The method of claim 7, wherein:

   the applying step comprises applying a respective integral
number of drops of ink to each pixel in a plurality of

pixels associated with that particular pixel, said respective
integral number being: at least one for each pixel, and at

least two, for at least one pixel of the plurality;
whereby, over the plurality of pixels, the average number

of drops is greater than one and nonintegral. 
The method of claim 8, wherein:

the superpixel is a two-by-two cluster of pixels.
