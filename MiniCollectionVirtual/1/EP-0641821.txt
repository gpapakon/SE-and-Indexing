<ABSTRACT>
A plastic moulding composition comprises (a) at least one organic thermoplastic polymer, (b) at least one black mineral pigment and (c) a further colorant which is an inorganic and/or organic pigment and/or a polymer-soluble dye, and optionally (d) further additives. This moulding composition is used for the production of shaped articles which are provided with coloured symbols with the aid of laser radiation. In the process for the production of such a moulding, said moulding composition is employed and the resultant moulding is subjected to laser radiation having a principal wavelength of 1064 nm or 532 nm.

<CLAIMS>
A plastics molding composition, which comprises (a) 
polyoxymethylene (POM) or polybutylene terephthalate 

(PBT), (b) 0.01 to 8% by weight of bone charcoal, 
containing 70 to 90% by weight of calcium phosphate 

and 30 to 10% by weight of carbon, the carbon being 
embedded in a matrix of calcium phosphate, and (c) 

at least one further coloring agent, selected from 
the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Yellow 180, 

C.I. Pigment Red 209, C.I. Pigment Brown 24, C.I. 
Pigment Green 7, C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3, C.I. 

Solvent Orange 63 or C.I. Solvent Violet 13. 
A plastics molding composition as claimed in claim 
1, wherein the component (a) is an oxymethylene 

copolymer. 
A plastics molding composition as claimed in claim 
1 or 2, wherein the particle diameter of the pigment 

(b) is in the range from 1 to 50 Âµm. 
A plastics molding composition as claimed in one or 
more of claims 1 to 3, wherein the amount of the 

coloring agent (c) is 0.001 to 10% by weight. 
A process for the production of a shaped article 
provided with colored symbols from a plastics 

molding composition by the action of a laser beam, 
which comprises employing a plastics molding composition 

which is composed of (a) polyoxymethylene  
 

(POM) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), (b) 0.01 
to 8% by weight of bone charcoal, containing 70 to 

90% by weight of calcium phosphate and 30 to 10% by 
weight of carbon, the carbon being embedded in a 

matrix of calcium phosphate, and (c) at least one 
further coloring agent, selected from the group 

consisting of C.I. Pigment Yellow 180, C.I. Pigment 
Red 209, C.I. Pigment Brown 24, C.I. Pigment Green 

7, C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3, C.I. Solvent Orange 63 or 
C.I. Solvent Violet 13, and exposing the shaped 

article to a laser beam having a main wavelength of 
1064 nm or of 532 nm. 
A plastics molding composition as claimed in one or 
more of claims 1 to 4 or a process for the production 

as claimed in claim 5, wherein the molding 
composition contains (d) further additives if appropriate. 
The use of a plastics molding composition as claimed 
in one or more of claims 1 to 4 and 6 as a material 

for the production of shaped objects which are 
provided with colored symbols using a laser beam.
