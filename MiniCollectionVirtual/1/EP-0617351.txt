<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus are disclosed for reading and 
processing control information that may originate from two 

different sources. The control information from one of 
the sources is received and encoded to match the control 

information originating from the other source. A 
processor within the control system reads the control 

information and immediately processes it through for use 
in controlling a heating or air conditioning system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for controlling the heating or cooling of 
an interior space according to the precharacterising features of claim 1. The document GB-A-2 099 607 discloses such a heating apparatus control system, 
wherein the operation of a gas fire is controlled by digitally encoded 
signals as control information received from two different sources, a handheld 
device as a infrared remote control transmitter and a hardwired remote 
control transmitter. The coded infrared signals are received by an infrared 
sensor and preamplifier unit which amplifies the signals and filters 
out unwanted ,,noise". Signals indicative of a desired operational function of 
the heating system may also be generated by actuation the hardwired remote 
control transmitter which generates signals of the same code as that 
of the infrared remote control transmitter and has an identical layout. 
Coded signals, whether generated by the infrared remote control transmitter 
or the hardwired remote control transmitter are then passed via a mixer 
to a receiver, which decodes the received signals and generates at the appropriate 
output location an analogue or digital signal, suitable for initiating 
the required control response in accordance with the selected command. Further it has been known such a system which has included receiving information 
from an infrared remote control as well as from a hardwired remote 
control wherein it is required separate decoding of the signals from 
each remote control and a storing of the decoded information in a particular 
microprocessor. The stored information could be accessed later by a different 
microprocessor dedicated to the control of the heating and air conditioning 
system. In order for this to occur, it was necessary for the two 
microprocessors to engage in "hand shake" dialogue before the transmission 
of information could occur. This process required the control microprocessor 
to periodically interrupt its main control activity and engage in 
the time consuming separate dialogue with the processor having the most  
 
recent control parameters. This process was in turn dependent on the control 
parameter processor itself having separately obtained information 
from either of the remote controls transmitting their own separate signals 
to this processor. The object of the invention is to provide an HVAC control system with the 
capability of processing information from at least two different remote 
sources directly to the main control processor in a timely and

<CLAIMS>
A system for controlling the heating or cooling of an interior space comprising: 

a) a first and second remote control transmitter (24, 26) for transmitting 
control information; 
b) a receiver (28) for receiving the transmitted control information 
from the first remote control transmitter (24); 
c) a main control processing device (36) for receiving the control information 
in the data format corresponding to the data format of the 

first remote control transmitter (24) for controlling the heating and 
cooling, the main control processing device (36) responsive to process 

the transmitted control information so as to update the controlled 
heating or cooling of the interior space, characterised in that 
d) the second remote control transmitter (26) transmitting control information 
in a different data format as the first remote control 

transmitter (24); and 
e) a signal processing device (30) is used for receiving the transmitted 
control information from the second remote control transmitter (26) 

and for encoding the received control information in a data format 
corresponding to the data format of control information transmitted 

by the first remote control transmitter (24). 
A system according to claim 1, characterised in that the main control processing 
device (36) receives the commonly formatted data at an interrupt  

 
input prompting said processing device (36) to immediately read the commonly 

formatted data. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the main control 
processing device (36) for processing the control information comprises: 


means for receiving a bit stream of control information; 
means for sampling each bit in the bit stream more than once to determine 
the binary value of the bit; 
means for storing the binary value of each bit. 
A system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
means for storing the value of each bit comprises: 


means for storing a predetermined number of bits as a byte of information; 
and 
means for comparing the first byte of information with a previously 
stored byte of information to determine whether the bit stream of 

information is a valid communication. 
A system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
means for storing the value of each bit further comprises: 


means for summing the value of each byte of information received 
except for the last byte of information; and 
means for comparing the summed value of each byte with the value 
of the last byte of received information so as to determine whether 

the control information was accurately processed by said main control 
processing device (36). 
A system according to one of the preceding claims, characterised by: 

means, responsive to the comparison of the summed value of each 
byte with the value of the last byte of received information, for updating 

the control information utilised by the main control program 
within said main control processing device (36).
