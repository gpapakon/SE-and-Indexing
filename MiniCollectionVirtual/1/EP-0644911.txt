<DESCRIPTION>
 FLOURINE TREATMENT OF POLYOLEFIN FILMSCross Reference to Related ApplicationsThis Application is a continuation-in-part of USSN 893,282, filed June 4, 1992.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to thermoplastic films and, more particularly, to partially fluorinated thermoplastic films especially well suited for use in various applications.Background of the InventionOne type of polyolefin film, stretch/cling films, is useful in a wide variety of fields including the bundling and packaging of food and other goods. One application of particular relevance to the present invention is in the bundling of goods for shipping and storage such as the bundling of large rolls of carpet, fabric or the like for shipping. An important subset of these bundling applications is in the containment and unitizing of pallet loads. In such applications, it is desirable that the film have cling properties to prevent unraveling of the film from the pallet. The tension in the stretched film may also cause the film to be more susceptible to punctures and tears. It is also desirable for polyolefin films, as a whole, to have good stretch, tensile, puncture resistance and tear resistance properties. Thermal stability of the various film components is important for the recycling of edge trim and film scrap generated in the various film production processes.To impart cling properties to, or improve the cling properties of, a particular film, a number of 

well-known tackifying additives have been utilized. Common tackifying additives include polybutenes, terpene resins, alkali metal stearates and hydrogenated rosins and rosin esters. The use of tackifying additives, however, may not be desirable. These additives have a tendency to accumulate on the stretch wrapping apparatus often requiring additional periodic cleaning and maintenance. They also can migrate into the bundled or unitized articles resulting in damage to such articles, as well as migrating throughout a film, even a multilayer film, causing tackiness on both sides. In palletizing operations, this may cause the film on adjacent pallets to cling together resulting in tear, puncture or other damage to the wrap and jeopardizing the integrity of the unitized load.For this reason, it is desirable for stretch/cling type film to have slip or "anti-cling" properties on its "outer" side to prevent this interpallet cling. Slip is defined in terms of coefficient of friction. In other words, it is desirable that the "outer" side of the film have a low
