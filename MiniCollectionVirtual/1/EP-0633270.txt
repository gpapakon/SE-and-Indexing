<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catalysts for the polymerization
of ethylene and its mixtures with olefins
CH2=CHRVIII, wherein RVIII is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical
having 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising the reaction product of a
solid catalyst component containing Ti, Mg and halogen, an
alkyl-Al compound and a particular electron donor compound.
The catalyst of the invention is suitably used in
(co)polymerization processes of ethylene to prepare
(co)polymers having narrow Molecular Weight Distribution
(MWD). The MWD is an important characteristic of ethylene
polymers in that it affects both the rheological behaviour,
and therefore the processability, and the final mechanical
properties. In particular, in the case of LLDPE, polymers with
narrow MWD are suitable for films and injection molding in
that deformation and shrinkage problems in the manufactured
article are minimized.The width of the molecular weight distribution for the
ethylene polymers is generally expressed as melt flow ratio
F/E, which is the ratio between the melt index measured by a
load of 21.6 Kg (melt index F) and that measured with a load
of 2.16 Kg (melt index E). The measurements of melt index are
carried out according to ASTM D-1238 and at 190 °C.A catalyst for preparing ethylene (co)polymers having
narrow MWD is described in the European patent application EP-A-373999: 
the catalyst comprises a solid catalyst component
consisting of a titanium compound supported on magnesium chloride,
an alkyl-Al compound and an electron donor compound (external
donor) selected from monoethers of the formula R'OR".
Good results in terms of narrow MWD are only obtained when the
solid component also contains an internal electron donor compound
(diisobutylphthalate)."EP 449302 discloses catalysts for preparing hyperpure
propylene polymers based on a solid catalyst component consisting
of a titanium compound and a diether as an internal
donor supported on a magnesium dihalide. Similarly EP 546573
describes a process for the production of polyolefins based on
the use of a catalyst containing a titanium compound and an
internal electron donor compound supported on magnesium
chloride. The yield of these polymerization processes, however,
is rather low."Catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and mixtures
thereof with one or more olefins CH2=CHRVIII have been now
found, which comprise particular external electron donor compounds
and are particularly suitable for the preparation of
ethylene (co)polymers with narrow MWD. Furthermore, when the
