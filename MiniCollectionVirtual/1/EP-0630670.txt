Vehicle for electric toy and model railways, having a carriage body (1) capable of 
inclining laterally inward during travel on bends, to which end the carriage body (1) is 

supported on mountings (11, 12; 11', 12') penetrating its base (2) of at least one of its 
bogies (3) via stop ramps (13, 13') extending substantially in the vehicle longitudinal 

direction, in such a manner that the swivel angle is proportionally constrained by the 
rotation of the bogie when traveling on bends, characterised in that in the case of the 

one bogie (3) the mountings (11, 12; 11', 12') and the carriage body (1) are provided 
with cam grooves (13, 13') in the form of the stop ramps, which extend obliquely to a 

horizontal plane, or suspending pins (5, 5') are provided which engage therein and 
are disposed horizontally and transverse to the longitudinal axis, and in that the other 

bogie is suspended on the carriage body (1) so as to swing unguided. 
Vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in that the mountings are lateral 
columns (11, 12) which are cylindrical on the exterior, which engage in corresponding, 

preferably also cylindrical arcuate guides (4) on the inner walls of the carriage body 
(1), and in that the suspending pins (5) and the grooves (13) are disposed in the 

overlapping guide region. 
Vehicle according to claim 2, characterised in that suspending pins (5) projecting 
inwards from the arcuate guides (4) project into grooves (13), preferably closed 

towards the inside, on the exteriors of the columns (11, 12). 
Vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the second bogie is 
connected to the carriage body by a rotary bolt guide having play. 
Vehicle according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the grooves (13) 
extend horizontally over one part of their length and obliquely over another, the pins 

resting both in the horizontal part during travel straight ahead, and upon rotation of the 
bogie along a bend, the pin on the outside of the bend moves in the horizontal part 

and the pin on the inside moves in the oblique part (Figures 1, 3, 5).  
 
Vehicle according to claim 1, in particular for driven vehicles for small track widths, 
e.g. track N, characterised in that the mountings comprise lateral guide faces (15, 16) 

with a cylindrical inner face for web walls (11', 12') engaging therebetween and having 
counter-guide webs (17, 18), which web walls are provided with continuous, obliquely 

disposed slots (13a) for a preferably detachable suspending pin (5') penetrating the 
webs (17, 18). 
Vehicle according to claim 6, characterised in that the suspending pin (5') forms the 
axle of a transmission spur pinion (23), which is disposed between the webs (17, 18) 

and which is in engagement with a power take-off worm (26) - disposed above the 
spur pinion in the vehicle longitudinal direction - of the motor shaft (27) on the one 

hand and with gearwheels (25) on the other, which mesh with gearwheels of the wheel 
pair (7, 8 and 9, 10 respectively). 
Vehicle according to claim 7, characterised in that the spur pinion (23) has tooth tips 
(24) which converge to a point in the axial direction. 
Vehicle for electric toy and model railways, having a carriage body capable of 
inclining laterally inward during travel on bends according to one of claims 1 to 8, 

having coupling tongues laterally pivotable on the carriage body each with a coupling 
shaft receiving the coupling head, characterised in that the coupling heads engage in 

one another rotatably about their longitudinal axis (Figures 11-14). 
Vehicle according to claim 9, characterised in that head pins (43) on an end plate 
(40) of one coupling head (32'') engage with widened, end threading regions (45) 

through an end plate (41) of the counter-coupling head (36'') in arcuate slots (44). 
Vehicle according to claim 10, characterised in that one of the end plates (40) has 
a centring pin (43a) engaging in a bore in the counter-plate (41). 
Vehicle according to claim 9, characterised in that one of the coupling heads (32) 
has a mushroom-shaped projection (34) capable of hooking through a lateral  

 
longitudinal slot (39) into a widened receiving bore (38) of the counter-head (36). 
Vehicle for electric toy and model railways, having a carriage body capable of 
inclining laterally inward during travel on bends according to one of claims 1 to 8, 

characterised in that the coupling parts are each fixed to the bogies (Fig. 15). 
Vehicle according to claim 13, characterised in that a short coupling tongue (47) 
braced resiliently in the middle position is pivotably fixed to the bogie and engages 

with a guide pin in a slide guide (59) on the carriage body (55) (Fig. 15). 
Vehicle according to claim 13 or 14, characterised in that the fixing bearing screw 
(53) of the bogie penetrates with clearance a pin (50) bearing with a rounded tip (56) 

on the carriage body (55) (Fig. 15).
