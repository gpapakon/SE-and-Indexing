<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to controlled-release microcapsules of acetylsalicyclic acid, which comprise acetylsalicyclic acid particles between 100 and 1000  mu m in size coated with a coating material consisting of mixture of a cellulosic film-forming polymer derivative, an anti-adhesive agent, a plasticizer, a lubricant and a vinylic film-forming polymer derivative. The invention also relates to a method of obtaining the abovementioned microcapsules.

gastrointestinal environment, characterized in that they comprise particles of

acetylsalicylic acid with a size of between 100 and 1000 µm which are coated and
designed so that, when ingested orally in a single administration of a dose D of

between 75 and 320 mg of ASA, they induce moderate ASA absorption kinetics in
vivo in man, extending over at least 24 hours, said ASA absorption being:


less than or equal to 10% by weight of the absorbed fraction of D at a time t after
ingestion of 0.4 hour,
less than or equal to 50% by weight of the absorbed fraction of D at t=3.9 hours, and
less than or equal to 90% by weight of the absorbed fraction of D at t=23 hours,
t being given to within ±10%.
