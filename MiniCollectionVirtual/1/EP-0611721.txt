<ABSTRACT>
A tape printer (1) for making adhesive labels includes 
a tape supply, a printer for reverse printing on the tape 

(4) and a double-sided adhesive film, one side of which is 
laminated to the printer tape and the other side of which 

carries a release paper. The printer has a cutter (18) for 
cutting the tape (4) from the continuous supply tape and 

includes a trimmer (20) for rounding the corners of the tape 
(4) to reduce defoliation of the tape from the surface to 

which it is applied. The cutting blade (50) of the trimmer 
(20) has a central straight section (54), contiguous arcuate 

sections (56,58) at each end of the central straight section 
(54) and auxiliary straight cutting edges (60,62) contiguous 

with the arcuate sections (56,58) and extending at an obtuse 
angle to the central straight section. The cutting blade 

(50) is mounted in an integrally molded support unit (30) 
which includes guide members for guiding the width of tape 

to be trimmed by the cutting blade (50). The support unit 
(30) is detachably mounted on a tape support member (2) so 

that tapes of differing widths can be trimmed by 
interchanging the support units (30). Levers (102) for 

actuating the cutting blade are movable from a position to 
actuate the cutter to a retracted position enabling 

replacement of the support unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing apparatus for use 
with a tape-like printing medium, on which letters and other 
characters are printed. Heretofore, a printing apparatus for printing 
letters and other characters on a tape-like printing 
medium has been known, for example, from Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 47-16105 published on March 12,1972, in 
which letters and characters are selected by an embossing 
disc, and printed on a tape-like printing medium. A 
printed part of the tape is cut to a predetermined length 
by means of a cutter blade and is adhered to desired 
articles so as to identify the articles. The cutter 
blade is usually of a straight or arcuate shape to cut the 
tape into a strip with a straight or arcuate end shape. 
Also, an apparatus has been known, for example, in Japanese 
Utility Model Publication No. 1-23423 published on 
July 18, 1989, in which a corner part of cards etc. is cut 
by a cutter blade having semicircular shape to cut the 
card into a strip with a semicircular end shape. However, in such a conventional apparatus, in case 
of a printed tape strip which has rectilinearly cut ends, 
it can be easily set in a predetermined position on a 
surface to which the tape is to be adhered, but it involves 
a problem that the four corners of the tape strip 
tend to separate from the bonded surface, which eventually 
can lead to defoliation of the entire tape strip. Moreover, 
in a conventional device, if the tape is adhered in 
the corner of a hollow surface, it is not possible to 
adhere the corner of the tape along the roundness or 
radius which is usually applied to an interior corner of 
the hollow surface.  
 In addition, the tape is cut near the printed 
character in order to reduce the blank portion of the tape 
edge when the tape is cut into a strip with an arcuate or 
a semicircular end shape. This gives rise to the possibility 
that a part of the character is cut which is near 
the tape edge, for example a letter "H" as shown in 
Fig.23, or a character with a vertical bar or a underline. 
Therefore, sufficient blank space was needed next to the 
final character to prevent portions of the characters at 
the ends of the tape from being cut off. Therefore, the 
cut tape became longer in relation to the number of 
characters and a large space was needed to receive the cut 
tape. It was not only uneconomical but also very inconvenient. 
Moreover, a printed tape strip which has 
rectilinearly cut ends can be easily aligned in a predetermined 
position on a surface to
