<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ω-hydroxy-(ω-3)-ketonitrile 
which is important as a synthetic intermediate or starting 
material for preparing various compounds, particularly 
important for preparing ω-hydroxy fatty acid which is an 
important intermediate of macrocyclic lactone type perfumes, 
and a method for producing ω-hydroxy fatty acid 
using the same. There have been known many methods for producing ω-hydroxy 
fatty acid which is an important intermediate of macrocyclic 
lactone type perfumes. Typical examples thereof are 
introduced in "Perfume Chemical Comprehensive 2", by Osamu 
Okuda, Hirokawa Shoten, p. 1211 and "Perfume Chemical 
Comprehensive 3", by Osamu Okuda, Hirokawa Shoten, p.p. 
172-174 and 176-177. The above methods include several drawbacks that these have 
many steps and are troublesome in handling, expensive 
agents or agents accompanied by dangers in handling are 
often required, and also the yield is poor.  
 The present inventors have studied about a method for preparing 
ω-hydroxy fatty acid which can solve the problems of 
the prior art as mentioned above and proposed in Japanese 
Provisional Patent Publications No. 11036/1991 and No. 
11046/1991 (which corresponds to U.S. Patents No. 5,023,351 
and 5,099,036 or EP-A-402 063) that α-(ω-cyanoalkanoyl)-γ-butyrolactone 
(II) is reacted in an aqueous solution in the 
presence of 2 to 20 mole of an alkali metal hydroxide per 
mole of said butyrolactone to obtain ω-hydroxy-(ω-3)-keto 
fatty acid (III) and then the acid is reacted with hydrazine 
to prepare ω-hydroxy fatty acid (IV) . However, in 
this method, it is difficult to separate the intermediate 
(III) since it is water-soluble. 
 
   wherein n is an integer of 7 to 11. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
method for preparing ω-hydroxy fatty acid which solves the 
problems as mentioned above. The present inventors have further studied about a method 
for industrially preparing ω-hydroxy fatty acid advantageously 
and have found that ω-hydroxy fatty acid (IV) can be 
prepared by using a novel compound ω-hydroxy-(ω-3)-ketonitrile 
(I) as an intermediate whereby the above problems 
can be solved to accomplish the present invention.  
 That is, the present invention relates to a novel compound 
ω-hydroxy-(ω-3)-ketonitrile represented by the following 
formula (I) which is an important synthetic intermediate 
for preparing ω-hydroxy fatty acid. 
NC(CH2)n―CO―(CH2)3OH
