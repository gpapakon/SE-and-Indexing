<ABSTRACT>
A diaphragm valve for high pressure use has a 
metal diaphragm which is actuated into and out of direct 

engagement with a valve seat by an air operator acting 
through a force multiplying lever assembly. The valve seat 

is confined by rigid interior and exterior sleeves while 
the sealing surface is contoured to have a concave 

configuration corresponding to the contour of the diaphragm 
in its deflected position. The air operator is provided 

with a stroke adjustment mechanism that is locked in 
adjusted position by a member that is generally accessible 

only when the operator is disconnected from the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed toward the
valve art and, more particularly, to an improved air
operated diaphragm valve.The valve is particularly suited for use as a
shut-off valve for high pressure, toxic gases as used in
the semi-conductor industry and will be described with
reference thereto; however, as will become apparent, the
valve could be used in other environments for other
purposes.The high pressure and toxic gases used as process
gases in the semi-conductor industry require highly
reliable valves. Reliability is measured by the ability to
contain the system fluid and shut off the flow of the
fluid. The semi-conductor industry has chosen packless
(metal membrane) valves to provide the desired level of
reliability and safety. Currently diaphragm type packless
valves are preferred because they are easier to clean and
faster to purge due to their lower internal volume
(compared to bellows valves).The size of the diaphragm needed is controlled by
the flow and cycle life requirements of the valve. In a
high pressure system, the size of diaphragm needed requires
a large amount of force to overcome the pressure load of
the system fluid on the diaphragm. In the majority of
applications for the subject valve, the operator must 
produce this large force while remaining within limitations on the size of the package and the
pressure available to actuate the operator. In order to meet all of these requirements, some
type of force multiplying mechanism is needed between the valve element and the operator.Precise control of the force output of the operator is needed. If the force output is too
low, the operator will not be able to overcome the pressure load on the diaphragm and shut
off the flow. If the force output is too high, the valve may not open with the pressure
available to actuate the valve.To produce high reliability, precise control of the up and down stroke movement of
the diaphragm is needed. In the case where a deformable seat material is used, good
containment of the material is needed to minimize deformation that would result in increased
diaphragm movement, which would decrease cycle life.Because of the above-noted factors, there is an ongoing need to improve the valves
and to increase seat and diaphragm life through better control and design of the relationships
between the various components including the force multiplying mechanism and the stroke
adjustment mechanism.Reference is also made to US-A-4828219 which discloses a valve according to the features in the preamble of claim 1.

<CLAIMS>
A valve having a body (16) defining a valve chamber (18) with a valve seat
(50) in the chamber and a flexible diaphragm assembly (40) for sealing the valve chamber

and movable to open and close the valve seat, the diaphragm assembly (40) comprising a
plurality of flexible metal diaphragm layers (40a, 40b...; 40a', 40b'...) in stacked and

juxtaposed relationship with a first diaphragm layer (40a; 40a') forming a wall of the valve
chamber and directly overlying the valve seat to open and close the valve seat and a second

metal diaphragm layer (40b; 40b') in engagement with the first diaphragm layer on the side
thereof opposite the valve chamber to provide backing for the first diaphragm layer, and

connecting means (100; 102a) joining at least the first and second diaphragm layers in an area aligned
centrally with the valve seat to prevent separation of the first and second diaphragm layers

and undesired closing of the valve seat caused by pressure build-up therebetween as a
consequence of failure of the first diaphragm; characterised in that the connecting means (100;

102a) permits at least some relative movement between the first and second layers during
operation of the valve.
A valve according to claim 1 wherein the connecting means comprises a small
welded connection (100) joining the first and second diaphragm layers in a location centrally

aligned with the valve seat.
A valve according to claim 1 wherein the connecting means comprises a
resilient and relatively elastic bond (102a) between the first and second diaphragm layers.
A valve according to any preceding claim wherein the connecting means (100;
102a, 102b...) is connected to all of the metal diaphragm layers in stacked and juxtaposed

relationship.
