<ABSTRACT>
A micrometric device (100) for finishing high 
precision bores comprises an upper cylindrical body (101) 

mounted and fixed to a lower cylindrical body (102), both 
of which coaxially envelope a rotatable graduated drum 

(104). The drum (104) is coaxially mounted and connected 
to a micrometric screw (105) arranged longitudinally of the 

body (101,102). A conversion mechanism 
(20,20a,21,22,23,24) is mounted to an upper extension of 

the micrometric screw (105) and is arranged to change 
rotating movement of the micrometric screw (105) into 

linear movement of a movable crossbeam (10) which supports 
a tool holder (11,11a) and respective cutting tool (12,13). 

Backlash suppression means (22,34) prevent backlash between 
any two moving parts (105,20; 20,23; 20,24) of the 

conversion mechanism and screw (105). The backlash 
suppression means (22,34) is a cylindrical bushing with 

internal and external threads (22a,22b; 34a,34b) engaging 
respective ones of the two moving parts. The internal and 

external threads of the bushing (22,34) have different 
pitches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a micrometric device 
for finishing high precision bores. GB-A-2250459 describes a micrometric device for 
finishing high precision bores comprising a substantially 
cylindrical, hollow body, a rotatable micrometric screw 
extending substantially longitudinally in said body, a tool 
supporting member supported by and movable with respect to 
said body, a tool holder carried by said tool supporting 
member, and moving means for causing linear movement of 
said tool supporting member upon rotation of said 
micrometric screw, and wherein backlash suppression means 
are provided to prevent backlash between first and second 
relatively movable parts of or associated with said moving 
means. The present invention seeks to provide a micrometric 
device of the type defined but with distinctive backlash 
suppression means. According to the present invention there is provided a 
micrometric device characterised in that said moving means 
for causing linear movement of said tool supporting member 
upon rotation of said micrometric screw comprises first and 
second concentric rods extending substantially 
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of said screw, the 
second rod extending within the first rod, and the first 
rod being coupled to said tool supporting member such that 
relative axial displacement of said first and second rods 
moves said tool supporting member substantially 
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of said screw, in 
that said backlash suppression means comprises a rotatable, 
substantially cylindrical bushing with both an internal and 
an external thread, the internal thread being engaged with  
 
said second, inner rod and the external thread being 
engaged with said first, outer rod, and in that said 
internal and external threads have different pitches. Preferably, said moving means comprises threaded means 
engaging both said first and second concentric rods and 
arranged such that rotation of said threaded means causes 
substantially axial, linear movement of said first rod and 
thereby causes relative axial adjustment of said first and 
second rods, and wherein said threaded means comprises said 
substantially cylindrical bushing and is arranged on a 
terminal of said second rod. In an embodiment, said moving means for causing linear 
movement of said tool supporting member upon rotation of 
said micrometric screw comprises a cylindrical rod 
coaxially arranged relative to said micrometric screw, and 
first and second concentric rods extending
