<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for parallel decoding of encoded image 
signals supplied in the form of an encoded bit stream, each of 

the image frames being decomposed into a predetermined number 
of variable length encoded blocks in the encoded bit stream, 

comprises a circuit having a single input terminal and N 
output terminals for receiving the encoded bit stream through 

the single input terminal, and demultiplexing the blocks in 
the encoded bit stream over the N output terminals; N parallel 

processing paths, each including a buffer memory respectively 
for performing the decoding operation including the variable 

length decoding on the blocks provided in its buffer memory; 
a provisional buffer memory circuit, disposed between the N 

output terminals and the N parallel processing paths, for 
temporarily storing the blocks to be applied to the respective 

buffer memory when the respective buffer memory is in a buffer 
full state, and providing the blocks to the respective buffer 

memory as the respective buffer memory has been released from 
the buffer full state; and a circuit for multiplexing the 

output signals from the N parallel processing paths into a 
single data stream. 
With the aid of the provisional buffer memory circuit 
including a provisional buffer memory having an appropriate 

storage capacity, the parallel decoding apparatus of the 
present invention can perform the decoding operation optimally  

 
with N buffer memories provided in the N parallel processing 

paths, having an overall storage capacity far less than the 
prior art parallel decoding apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decoding apparatus; 
and, more particularly, to an apparatus for the parallel 
decoding of variable length encoded image signal with N 
parallel processing paths. In various electronic/electrical applications such as 
high definition television and video telephone systems, an 
image signal may need be transmitted in a digitized form. When 
the image signal is expressed in a digitized form, there is 
bound to occur a substantial amount of digital data. Since, 
however, the available frequency bandwidth of a conventional 
transmission channel is limited, in order to transmit the 
image signal therethrough, the use of an image signal encoding 
apparatus often becomes necessary to compress the substantial 
amounts of digital data. Accordingly, most image signal encoding apparatus of 
prior art employ various compression techniques(or coding 
methods) built on the idea of utilizing or reducing spatial 
and/or temporal redundancies inherent in the input image 
signal.  An example of such prior art image signal encoding 
apparatus can be found in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,394,774. 
According to an embodiment of the encoding apparatus of this 
patent, input image signals, which have previously been 
decomposed into blocks of a size appropriate for data 
compression, successively traverse, on a block-by-block basis, 
a discrete cosine transform circuit, a normalization circuit, 
a quantization circuit, and a variable length encoding 
circuit, with which a desired compression rate can be 
obtained. The output signals of the variable length encoding 
circuit(i.e., encoded blocks) are then applied to a rate 
control circuit having a buffer memory. At the output of this 
circuit, a transmission channel extracts, at a fixed 
frequency, the encoded blocks stored in said buffer memory to 
form an encoded bit stream. Simultaneously, the quantization 
step is controlled by the filling state of this buffer memory 
in such a way that the buffer memory is never completely 
filled or completely emptied. The decoding of the image signals so encoded is an 
inverse process of the encoding operation. Specifically, as 
the transmission channel fills the buffer memory in a decoding 
apparatus at a constant rate with the encoded bit stream, the 
decoding apparatus comprising a variable length decoding 
circuit, an inverse quantization circuit, an inverse 
normalization circuit and an inverse discrete cosine transform 
circuit, reads this buffer memory and decodes the encoded  
 
blocks present in
