<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the detection of contaminated reusable bottles by means of various types of analysers in a sampling system. In this case, it is intended to carry out perfect analysis of the residues found in reusable beverage bottles. For this purpose it is proposed to arrange a first sampling system, the samples supplied to which are subjected to a nitrogen oxide analysis, and to provide a second sampling system whose samples are subjected to a photoionisation analysis and/or flame-ionisation analysis and then to subject the pretested bottles to mass-spectrometry analysis.
