<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite
magnetic member comprising at least one non-magnetized
part and at least one ferromagnetized part, both parts
being continuously and integrally formed, a process for
producing the member and an electromagnetic valve using
the member, and particularly to a composite magnetic
member capable of fully maintaining ferromagnetic and
non-magnetic characteristics against changes in
temperature, process for producing the member and an
electromagnetic valve using the member.In generating a magnetic circuit in products
such as electromagnetic valves, etc. by discretely
providing a ferromagnetic part and a non-magnetic part
in one product, it is necessary to make a mild steel
part from a ferromagnetic material and an austenitic
stainless steel part from a non-magnetic material
individually, then assemble these ferromagnetic part and
the non-magnetic part together while joining the parts
properly by bonding, for example, by soldering, to make
a member for the magnetic circuit. However, in making a
member for the magnetic circuit in this manner, it is
necessary to make a plurality of parts from a ferro-magnetic 
material and a plurality of parts from a non-magnetic
material individually and assemble such a
plurality of the parts, while joining them by bonding.
Thus, many steps and much labor are required for making
such a member, complicating the procedure.It is known that ordinary austenite stainless
steel, high manganese steel, etc. are in a non-magnetic
state after solid-solution treatment, but can be given a
ferromagnetic property by cold working at room temperature
to induce and generate a martensite structure.
However, the degree of ferromagnetization obtained by
this procedure is not high and thus it is actually
difficult to apply this procedure to production of
members for the magnetic circuit.It is also possible as a means for locally
non-magnetizing part of a ferromagnetic material such as
mild steel, etc. to diffuse an austenitizing element
such as Mn, Cr, Ni, etc. into the ferromagnetic material
from the surface, but such a means still has a problem
in the production of members for the magnetic circuit.JP-A-63-161146 discloses materials utilizable
as a magnetic scale by optimizing the composition of
austenite stainless steel or high manganese steel and
working procedures for such materials to make members
having both ferromagnetic and non-magnetic properties at
the same time, where metastable austenite stainless
steel is cold drawn into wires, thereby
