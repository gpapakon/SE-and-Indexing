<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mucosal adhesives. In 
another aspect this invention relates to compositions that 
adhere to oral mucosa. In yet another aspect this 
invention relates to compositions for use for 
transmucosal drug delivery. Buccal tablets and like devices are known and 
disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,740,365 and 
4,764,378. These devices adhere to mucosal surfaces and 
dissolve or otherwise disintegrate over time, thus 
delivering drug into the mouth of the patient in a 
sustained fashion. It is also known that delivery of 
drugs across the oral mucosa avoids hepatic first-pass 
inactivation, inactivation by gastro-intestinal fluids, 
and other modes of inactivation characterisitic of oral 
drug ingestion. Sustained release adhesive bandages, 
patches, and the like that contain drugs and adhere to 
mucosal surfaces are known to the art. Polyacrylic acids 
and polyisobutylenes have been disclosed as components of 
such adhesives. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,339,546 
(Chen) discloses a bandage that is said to adhere to moist 
surfaces of the oral cavity and comprises a medicament and 
a hydrocolloid incorporated in a natural or synthetic 
gum-like substance. Carboxypolymethylene (i.e., 
polyacrylic acid) is among the hydrocolloids disclosed, 
and polyisobutylene is among the gum-like substances 
disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,697 (Robinson) discloses a 
composition including a bioadhesive and a treating agent. 
The bioadhesive is a water-swellable but water insoluble, 
fibrous, crosslinked, carboxy-functional polymer  
 
containing (a) a plurality of repeating units of which at 
least about 80% contain at least 1 carboxy functionality, 
and (b) about 0.05 to about 1.5% of a cross-linking agent 
substantially free from polyalkenyl polyether. The 
specifically excluded type of crosslinker is said to be 
the type used in CARBOPOL™ 934 resin (commercially 
available from B. F. Goodrich, Specialty Chemicals and 
Polymers Division, Cleveland, OH). CARBOPOL™ 934 resin is 
psaid to be water soluble and therefore undesirable as a 
bioadhesive in the Robinson composition. U.S. Pat. No. 4,253,460 (Chen et al.) discloses 
an adhesive composition consisting of a mixture of a 
hydrocolloid gum, a pressure sensitive adhesive, and a 
cohesive strengthening agent. The pressure sensitive 
adhesive component can be a mixture of three to five parts 
of a polyisobutylene with a viscosity average molecular 
weight of about 36,000 to about 53,000 and one part of an 
elastomer such as a polyisobutylene
