<ABSTRACT>
Seam-weaving machine for the continuous production of a fabric which weaves a woven seam (1) from fringes (11, 21) formed on the opposite fabric ends (10, 20) and from weft threads (auxiliary warp threads 3) extracted from the fabric, by means of a separator, a shedding device, gripper devices receiving the fringes (11, 21) from the separator and inserting them into the seam-weaving shed (2), and a slay, respective mutually aligned fringes (11, 21) of the fabric ends (10, 20) being guided out of the woven seam (1) upwards or downwards at picking points (4) distributed over the width of the woven seam (1). Arranged in the edge region of the woven seam (1) is a fringe catcher (30) having a drive device (33) which, after the shed change, moves the fringe catcher (30) forwards beyond the selvedge (9) and back, so that the fringe catcher (30) pulls away an upwardly projecting fringe (11, 21) rearwards and above the already formed part of the woven seam (1).

<CLAIMS>
Seam-weaving machine for making a fabric endless, which 
seam-weaving machine weaves a woven seam (1) out of 

fringes (11, 21) formed at the opposed fabric ends (10, 
20) and from weft threads (auxiliary warp threads 3) 

removed from the fabric by means of a separator, a 
shedding device, gripper devices which take over the 

fringes (11, 21) from the separator and insert them into 
the seam-weaving shed (2), and a sley, wherein fringes 

(11, 21), aligning with each other, of the fabric ends 
(10, 20) are guided upwardly and/or downwardly out of the 

woven seam (1) at splice points (4) which are distributed 
over the width of the woven seam (1), characterized in 

that there is arranged in the edge zone of the woven seam 
(1) a fringe catcher (30) which has a drive device (33) 

which, after the shed change, moves the fringe catcher 
(30) forward beyond the fell (9) and back, so that the 

fringe catcher (30) draws an upwardly protruding fringe 
(11, 21) away to the rear and above the already formed 

part of the woven seam (1). 
Seam-weaving machine according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the shedding device forms the upper shed in the 

plane of the fabric ends (10, 20) and of the woven seam 
(1). 
Seam-weaving machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the drive device (33) moves the 

fringe catcher, after the shed change following the 
insertion of the fringe (11, 12), for the grasping of 

the fringe (11, 12), forward beyond the fell (9) and 
back.  

 
Seam-weaving machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the fringe catcher (30) is 

positioned in the edge zone of the woven seam (1). 
Seam-weaving machine according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the shedding device leaves the outermost edge 

zones (8) of the woven seam (1) of some millimetres width 
free of splice points (4). 
Fringe catcher (30) for a seam-weaving machine according 
to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the fringe catcher 

(30) is an arm, movable by a drive mechanism (33), with a 
hook (32) which grasps fringe ends protruding from the 

woven seam (1), characterized in that the drive device 
(33), after the shed change, moves the fringe catcher (30) 

on the plane of the fabric forward beyond the fell (9), so 
that the fringe catcher (30) draws the upwardly protruding 

fringe (11, 21) away to the rear and above the already 
formed part of the woven seam (1).
