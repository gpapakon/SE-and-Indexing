<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a series motor, especially a universal motor, having a braking device and having a stator comprising a field winding and having a rotating armature supplied via a commutator and brushes as well as a switching arrangement suitable for switching over the field winding into braking operation and/or a braking device which induces an additional magnetic field in braking operation. It is proposed to develop the series motor such that, when switching over from motor operation to generator operation or braking operation, secure initiation of the braking process is achieved in simple ways and means by self-energisation. For this purpose, provision is made for further means which induce a magnetic field, preferably a permanent magnet (24), to be assigned to the pole-shoe lamination stack (26) of the stator, in addition to the field coils (12), and/or for the switching arrangement to have a timer.
