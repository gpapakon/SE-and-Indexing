<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a thermoformable multilayer (composite, laminate) film which contains a top film containing certain amounts by weight of a) at least one crosslinked PP-EPDM and b) an uncrosslinked propylene block copolymer or heterophase propylene block polymer, where from 15 to 1 % by weight of b) has been replaced by the same amounts by weight of a polymer and/or ionomer c) containing reactive groups. The lower film or films contain(s) at least two different polyolefins or compounds containing olefin groups.

<CLAIMS>
A thermoformable composite sheet which contains a
polyolefin-containing upper sheet and at least one

polyolefin-containing lower sheet which differs in
quality and quantity from the composition of the upper

sheet, and also optionally a protective surface layer,
the upper sheet (relative to 100 parts by weight

plastics material of the upper sheet) containing

a) 20 to 80 parts by weight

of at least one cross-linked PP-EPDM (alloy or mixture
of propylene homopolymer and/or copolymer and cross-linked

or partially cross-linked ethylene-propylenediene
mixed polymer),
b) 80 to 20 parts by weight

of a non-cross-linked propylene block copolymer or
heterophase propylene block polymer, having a ethylene-propylene-elastomer

content in the block or in the
chain of 35 to 75% by weight (relative to 100 parts by

weight of the non-cross-linked heterophase propylene
block copolymer or propylene block polymer), with 15 to

1% by weight, preferably 10 to 2% by weight, of (b)
being replaced by the same quantities by weight of a

polymer and/or ionomer containing reactive groups (c),
wherein
c) is at least one polymer and/or ionomer, containing
reactive groups, based on ethylene and methacrylic acid

and/or acrylic acid, the acid groups partially
containing metal ions or being neutralised by metal

ions, and the lower sheet or sheets contain(s) at least
two different polyolefins or polyolefin-containing 

polymers, copolymers, terpolymers or block polymers,
characterised in that the lower sheet as plastics

material consists of 65% by weight to 90% by weight
(relative to 100% by weight plastics content of the

lower sheet) propylene homopolymer, copolymer,
terpolymer and/or block polymer and 35 to 10% by weight

ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer having a vinyl acetate
content of 10 to 40% by weight or contains these

plastics materials, one plastics constituent or the
plastics mixture or the plastics alloy being treated

with 0.1 to 5.0% by weight of at least one peroxide or
a compound containing peroxide groups, or that the

lower sheet with at least one partially cross-linked
EPDM, a propylene homopolymer, copolymer or graft

polymer with or without reactive groups additionally
contains a block, diblock or triblock polymer and/or

graft polymer containing styrene or polystyrene, which
is partially replaced by a modifying agent based on a

propylene-maleic acid anhydride mixed or graft polymer,
a propylene-acrylic acid mixed or graft polymer, an

ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene-acrylic
acid or methacrylic acid copolymer, an ethylene-acrylic

acid ester copolymer, a glycidyl-methacrylate copolymer
and/or terpolymer, preferably an olefinic or olefin

group-containing glycidyl-methacrylate copolymer and/or
terpolymer, an ethylene-glycidyl-methacrylate

terpolymer, an olefinic ionomer, a polyurethane, a

polycaprolactone, a polyester ether and/or a polyether
amide.
A thermoformable composite sheet according to
Claim 1, characterised in that the constituents of the

lower sheet are selected such that the lower sheet
produced therefrom (relative to the initial or starting

cross-section of the lower sheet) has a maximum offset
yield strength in the range from 20 x 10
3
 to 130 x
10
3
 Pa (these values being determined at a constant 
deformation rate at 170Â°C) and/or that the stress-strain

curve at an elongation of above 150%, preferably
above 300% elongation, after reaching the maximum runs

approximately parallel to the axis of elongation
A thermoformable composite sheet according to
Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the lower sheet

as plastics material consists of 70 to 85% by weight,
preferably 75 to 83% by weight (relative to 100% by

weight plastics content of the lower sheet) propylene
homopolymer, copolymer, terpolymer and/or block polymer

and 30 to 15% by weight, preferably 25 to 17% by
weight, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer which contain

or are treated with at least one peroxide or a compound
containing peroxide groups.
A thermoformable composite sheet according to one
or more of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the

propylene or polypropylene content (content of
propylene homopolymer, copolymer, terpolymer or block

polymer) of the cross-linked PP-EPDM (constituent (a))
of the upper sheet relative to 100 parts by weight of

the PP-EPDM contained in the upper sheet is between 60
and 90% by weight, preferably 65 to 85% by weight, and

that the EPDM has been cross-linked with a peroxide or
a compound containing peroxide groups and has a

percentage by weight (relative to 100 parts by weight
