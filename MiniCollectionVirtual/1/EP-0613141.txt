<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus (1) for a record carrier (20) in 
the form of a tape comprises a forward drive wheel (42) which is coaxial with a 

forward winding mandrel (7) and a reverse drive wheel (43) which is coaxial with a 
reverse winding mandrel (8) and a drive means (47) for driving the forward drive wheel 

(42) and the reverse drive wheel (43), the drive means comprising a drive shaft (54) 
which can be set to different operating positions, which drive shaft comprises a friction-wheel 

drive portion (111) for driving a friction-wheel portion (44) of the forward drive 
wheel (42), and a toothed-wheel drive portion (112) for driving a toothed-wheel portion 

(46) of the reverse drive wheel (43). In addition, the drive means (47) can drive the 
forward drive wheel (42) 
via
 a toothed-wheel portion (115) thereof, for which purpose 
the drive means (47) comprises a toothed-wheel drive (116) which can be set to a fast-forward 

driving position in which it is in mesh both with a toothed-wheel drive portion 
(112) of the drive shaft (54) and with the toothed-wheel portion (115) of the forward 

drive wheel (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus for a
record carrier in the form of a tape which extends between two juxtaposed rotatable reel
hubs, which apparatus comprises a forward winding mandrel and a reverse winding
mandrel for driving the two reel hubs, a forward drive wheel which is in driving
engagement with the forward winding mandrel and which comprises a friction-wheel
portion via which it can be driven in a "normal forward" mode, a reverse drive wheel
which is in driving engagement with the reverse winding mandrel and which comprises
a toothed-wheel portion via which it can be driven in a "fast reverse" mode, and a drive
means for driving the forward drive wheel and the reverse drive wheel, the drive means
comprising a drive shaft which can be driven by a motor, which is disposed
substantially in an area between the two drive wheels, and which can be set to different
operating positions, which drive shaft comprises a friction-wheel drive portion which, in
a normal-forward driving position of the drive shaft, can drive the friction-wheel
portion of the forward drive wheel in the "normal forward" mode, and a toothed-wheel
drive portion which, in a fast-reverse driving position of the drive shaft, can drive the
toothed-wheel portion of the reverse drive wheel in the "fast reverse" mode, the drive
means in addition being capable of driving the forward drive wheel in a "fast forward"
mode.Such an apparatus is known as a so-called pocket dictation machine which
has been marketed by the Applicant under the type designation LFH 0596. In the "fast
forward" mode of this known apparatus the forward drive wheel is driven by the same
parts of the drive means as in the "normal forward" mode. In the "fast forward" mode,
in the same way as in the "normal forward" mode, the friction-wheel drive portion of
the drive shaft, which shaft can be driven by means of the motor, is brought into
driving engagement with the friction-wheel portion of the forward drive wheel in that
the drive shaft is also moved into its normal forward driving position in the "fast 
forward" mode, but in the "fast forward" mode the motor is connected to a non-regulated
comparatively high supply voltage produced by batteries whereas in the
"normal forward" mode the motor is connected to a regulated comparatively low supply
voltage. The non-regulated supply voltage is only about twice as high as the regulated
supply voltage, so that in the "fast forward" mode the motor and, consequently, the
forward drive wheel is

<CLAIMS>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus (1) for a record carrier (20) in
the form of a tape which extends between two juxtaposed rotatable reel hubs (21, 22),

which apparatus comprises a forward winding mandrel (7) and a reverse winding
mandrel (8) for driving the two reel hubs (21, 22), a forward drive wheel (42) which is

in driving engagement with the forward winding mandrel (7) and which comprises a
friction-wheel portion (44) 
via
 which it (42) can be driven in a "normal forward" mode,
a reverse drive wheel (43) which is in driving engagement with the reverse winding

mandrel (8) and which comprises a toothed-wheel portion (46) 
via
 which it (43) can be
driven in a "fast reverse" mode, and a drive means (47) for driving the forward drive

wheel (42) and the reverse drive wheel (43), the drive means comprising a drive shaft
(54) which can be driven by a motor (48), which is disposed substantially in an area

between the two drive wheels (42, 43), and which can be set to different operating
positions, which drive shaft comprises a friction-wheel drive portion (111) which, in a

normal-forward driving position of the drive shaft (54), can drive the friction-wheel
portion (44) of the forward drive wheel (42) in the "normal forward" mode, and a

toothed-wheel drive portion (112) which, in a fast-reverse driving position of the drive
shaft (54), can drive the toothed-wheel portion (46) of the reverse drive wheel (43) in

the "fast reverse" mode, the drive means (47) in addition being capable of driving the
forward drive wheel (42) in a "fast forward" mode, characterized in that the forward

drive wheel (42) has a toothed-wheel portion (115), and the drive means (47) comprises
a toothed-wheel drive (116) which is movable between a non-driving position and a fast-forward

driving position in which said toothed-wheel drive, when the drive shaft (54) is
not in its normal-forward driving position and not in its fast-reverse driving position, is

in mesh both with a toothed-wheel drive portion (112) of the drive shaft (54) and with
the toothed-wheel portion (115) of the forward drive wheel (42) to drive the last-mentioned

wheel (42) in the "fast forward" mode.
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that in its fast-forward
driving position the toothed-wheel drive (116) is in mesh with that toothed-wheel

drive portion (112) of the drive shaft (54) which, in the fast-reverse operating
position of the drive shaft (54), can drive the toothed-wheel portion (46) of the reverse

drive wheel (43) in the "fast reverse" mode (Fig. 7). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
toothed-wheel drive (116) comprises two toothed wheels (117, 118) which are coaxial

with one another, which have mutually different diameters and which are interlocked in
rotation (Figs. 3 to 8).

the toothed-wheel portion (115) of the forward drive wheel (42) (Fig. 7).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that in the fast-forward
driving position of the toothed-wheel drive (116) the toothed wheel (118)

having the smaller diameter is in mesh with a toothed-wheel portion (115) formed by
