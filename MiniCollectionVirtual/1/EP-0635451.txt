<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically locking an inner telescopic tower mast (13) with respect to an outer tower mast (1) of a tower crane is provided with a locking lever (5) mounted on the outer tower mast (1). This locking lever is held in its unlocked position by a ratchet lever (7), which can be released by an unlocking element (17), arranged on the telescopic mast (13), in such a way that the locking lever (5) drops into its locking position, in which it engages behind an operating rest (15) of the telescopic mast (13). In order to guarantee that the locking lever (5) released by the ratchet lever (7) always drops into its exactly defined locking position and the pivot mounting of the locking lever is only subjected to smaller loads, the locking lever (5) runs approximately horizontally in its locked position. Here, the locking lever (5), between its mounting and its application (28) on the operating rest (15), is supported on an abutment (26) of the outer tower mast (1).
