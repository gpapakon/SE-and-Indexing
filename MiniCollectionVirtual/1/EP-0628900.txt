<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum valve (15) includes: a pressure control chamber (83) 
for giving a vacuum force to a valve body (71) capable of 

connecting a valve operating chamber (25) with a vacuum 
passage; a detecting valve (68) capable of introducing a vacuum 

force into the pressure control chamber (83); a plunger (65) 
directly driven by a liquid detecting diaphragm (60), wherein 

the plunger (65) drives the detecting valve (68); and an 
opening time adjusting valve (74) which is opened so that the 

vacuum introduced into the pressure control chamber (83) can be 
released, wherein the opening time is automatically controlled 

by the vacuum in the vacuum discharge pipe (14). Furthermore, 
when the inside of a liquid level detecting pipe section (56) 

is quickly decompressed, pressure in a pressure adjusting 
chamber (102) is quickly released through a gap formed between 

a damping diaphragm (59) and supporting section (112). The 

pressure adjusting chamber (102) is communicated with an upper 
pressurizing chamber (81) through a communicating hole (103). 

Therefore, when the pressure adjusting chamber (102) is quickly 
decompressed, the upper pressurizing chamber (81) is also 

quickly decompressed. Due to the foregoing, resilient 
deformation of a liquid level detecting diaphragm (60) is 

quickly cancelled, and the pushing action conducted by a 
plunger (65) on a detecting valve (68) is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum valve control
device.Usually, sewage discharged from every home flows to a
sewage disposal plant by the action of natural flow. However,
in this natural flow type sewage collection system, the
construction of sewer pipes is restricted by geography and the
condition of ground, and further the drain tends to be stopped
up. For this reason, recently, attention has been given to a
vacuum type sewage collection system in which sewage discharged
from every home is forcibly transported by the action of
vacuum.This vacuum type sewage collection system includes: a
vacuum valve unit in which sewage discharged from each home is
stored when it flows by the action of natural flow; and a
vacuum station by which sewage is collected from the vacuum
valve unit through a vacuum pipe. A vacuum valve unit is disclosed, for example, in
US-A-5,069,243. The vacuum valve unit disclosed in the above
patent includes: a suction pipe, one end of which is dipped in
sewage in the sewage tank; a vacuum valve, the pipe-shaped
communicating portion of which is connected with the other end
of the suction pipe; and a vacuum discharge pipe connected with
the communicating portion, wherein this vacuum discharge pipe
is connected with a vacuum pump disposed in a vacuum station
through a vacuum pipe. In the vacuum valve, the pipe-shaped
communicating portion can be opened and closed when a valve
body disposed in the pipe-shaped communicating portion is
operated. The vacuum pipe is maintained to be in a vacuum
condition at all times by the action of the vacuum pump through
the vacuum pipe. When a predetermined amount of sewage is
stored in the sewage tank, the valve body of the vacuum valve
is opened by a pressure difference between the vacuum in the
vacuum discharge pipe and the atmosphere, so that the pipe-shaped
communicating portion can be opened. Due to the
foregoing, the vacuum discharge pipe in a vacuum condition is
communicated with the suction pipe, so that sewage in the
sewage tank is sucked into the vacuum discharge pipe by the
action of vacuum, and transported to the vacuum station through
the vacuum pipe.The valve body disposed in the communicating portion of the
vacuum valve usually closes the communicating portion. When
the valve operating chamber is put into a vacuum condition, the 
valve body is pulled so that the communicating portion can be
opened. The vacuum condition in the valve operating chamber is
controlled by the vacuum valve control device.This vacuum valve control device is

<CLAIMS>
A vacuum valve control device (27) for controlling opening
and closing operations of a vacuum valve (15) which opens

and closes by vacuum a pipe-shaped connecting section (28)
for connec
ting a vacuum discharge pipe (14) in a vacuum
condition with a suction pipe (13) for sucking liquid from

a tank (11), said vacuum valve control device (27)
comprising:


a liquid level detecting pipe (56) inside pressure of
which fluctuates in accordance with a liquid level in the

tank (11);
a pressure adjusting chamber (102) communicated with said
liquid level detecting pipe (56);
a liquid level detecting diaphragm (60) resiliently
deformed when the pressure in said pressure adjusting

chamber (102) is activated on said diaphragm (60) through a
communicating hole (103);
a changeover valve (71) changed over by an action of vacuum
so as to selectively supply vacuum or atmosphere to said

vacuum valve (15);
a detection valve (68) for controlling supply and stop of
vacuum to said changeover valve (71); and
a plunger (65) for changing over said detection valve (68)
being driven by the resilient deformation of said liquid

level detecting diaphragm (60); wherein: 
a damping diaphragm (59) is disposed between said liquid
level detecting pipe section (56) and said pressure

adjusting chamber (102), and said damping diaphragm (59)
has at least one small through-hole (59a) so that said

damping diaphragm (59) is not resiliently deformed when the
pressure in said liquid level detecting pipe section (56)

is gradually increased, said damping diaphragm (102) being
resiliently deformed by the decompression of the pressure

adjusting chamber (102) so that a communicating hole (103)
formed between said pressure adjusting chamber (102) and

said liquid level detecting diaphragm (60) is closed,

characterized in that
said damping diaphragm (59) is not fixed at its periphery
to a support portion (112) and forms a gap between said

support portion (112) and its outer periphery to release
the pressure from its peripheral portion into said liquid

level detecting pipe (56) when the pressure in said
pressure adjusting chamber (102) is quickly increased.
A vacuum valve control device as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that

a diameter of said through-hole (59a) is determined in such
a manner that area of said through-hole is less than 1/8 of

said cross-section of the communicating hole (103).
