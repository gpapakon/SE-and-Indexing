<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a method for enhancing and accelerating the repair of chronic cellular and molecular damage to skin. Also provided is a method for thinning stratum corneum of mammalian, preferably human, skin thickened by extrinsic free radicals and restoring elastic tissue damaged by extrinsic free radicals. Both methods comprise the topical administration to mammalian, preferably human, skin of a composition comprising selenoamino acids in a pharmaceutically acceptable transdermal carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for enhancing and accelerating the repair
of chronic cellular and molecular damage to the skin.Recently it has become apparent that chronic free radical damage to the skin
either from UV irradiation or from environmental pollutants causes specific
deterioration of the epidermis and dermis that is distinct from the acute effects of
UV irradiation and is not simply an acceleration of the inevitable age-dependent
alterations denoted in the dermatologic literature as "intrinsic" aging.The particular chronic cumulative damage caused by UV irradiation is
denoted in the medical dermatologic literature as "photoaging" and is manifested
clinically by wrinkles, dry, waxy skin, and a variety of benign and premalignant as
well as malignant neoplasms. All of these clinical changes are the result of specific
salient histologic features of actinically damaged skin which have been characterized
and are (i) hypertrophy of the epidermis with cellular atypia and thickening of the
stratum corneum, (ii) solar elastosis with tangled, degraded dermal elastic tissue
degeneration into an amorphous mass (Kligman AM, JAMA, 210, 2377, 1969), (iii)
degradation of dermal collagen to become larger rope-like structures (Bentley JP,
J. Invest. Dermatol. 73, 80, 1979), and (iv) hypercellularity of the dermis (Andrew
W, et al: Gerontologica 10, 1, 1964).Topical application of retinoic acid (Retin A, Ortho Pharmaceutical 
Corporation) reportedly results in epidermal repair with thinning of the excessive
stratum corneum and normalization of the cellular atypia of the deeper layers of the
epidermis as well as the formation of new, fine fibrillar dermal collagen and
restructuring of the damaged dermal elastic tissue to the normal non-tangled,
fibrillar form. (Kligman AM, Leyden JJ, Kligman LH, Grove GL, Topical Retinoic
Acid for the reversal of Photoaging, Communication from Ortho Pharmaceutical
Corporation, February 1986; Weiss JS. Ellis CN, Headington JT, Tincoff T,
Hamilton TA, Voorhees JJ, JAMA 259, 527, 1988). However, the use of topical
retinoic acid usually causes discomfort, flaking and erythema at the beginning of
treatment and increased sensitivity to sunlight (Burke KE, Graham GF, North
Carolina, New York, JAMA 260, 3130, 1988).It has previously been shown that topical application of selenoamino acids
leads to transdermal absorption with enhanced levels of selenium in the skin to
provide protection from UV irradiation induced skin damage, significantly reducing
the incidence of skin cancers
