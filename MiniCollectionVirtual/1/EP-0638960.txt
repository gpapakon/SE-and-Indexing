<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) has a housing (12) and spring 
contacts (14). The housing (12) has uniform straight, 

cross-sectional T-shaped contact receiving slots (16). The 
spring contacts (14) have middle sections (28) fixedly 

mounted to the housing (12) in head sections (18) of the 
T-shaped slots (16) and top sections (30). The top sections 

(30) have contact areas (40) deflectably located in base 
sections (20) of the T-shaped slots (16) and pre-load tabs 

(42) movably confined in the head sections (18) of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to a new configuration of connecting 
electrical contacts to a housing that form the electrical 
connector. U. S. Patent 4,017,143 discloses electrical contacts that 
are press-fit into a housing. The contacts have upper 
tabs, contact bowed sections, a tail section, and a widened 
middle section. U.S. Patent 5,131,872 discloses an 
electrical contact having a positioning U-shaped portion 
and an extension portion at its middle. U.S. Patent 
4,966,557 discloses an electrical contact with a U-shaped 
retention section. U.S. Patents 4,188,715 and 5,171,154 
show other types of electrical connectors. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention 
an electrical connector is provided comprising a housing 
and a plurality of spring contacts. The housing has a 
plurality of contact receiving slots. At least some of 
these slots extend entirely through the housing with a 
uniform straight, general cross-sectional T-shape. Each of 
the T-shaped slots have a head section and a base section 
that form the general T-shape. The spring contacts are one 
piece contacts fixedly connected to the housing in the T-shaped 
slots. Each contact has a middle section located in 
the head section of one of the T-shaped slots with 
retention arms extending from opposite sides of the middle 
section across the height of the head section to fixedly  
 
mount the middle section in the head section. Each contact 
also has a top section with a contact area deflectably 
located in the base section and a pre-load tab movably 
located in the head section. In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention, an electrical connector is provided comprising 
a housing and spring contacts fixedly connected to the 
housing. The housing has straight, cross-sectional T-shaped 
slots extending from a top of the housing to a 
bottom of the housing. The spring contacts are fixedly 
connected in the T-shaped slots. The contacts each have a 
bottom contact section extending from the bottom of the 
housing, a middle section fixedly connected to the housing 
in a head section of one of the T-shaped slots and a top 
contact section movably located in the T-shaped slot. The foregoing aspects and other features of the invention 
are explained in the following description, taken in 
connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Fig. 1 is a perspective sectional view of an electrical 
connector incorporating features of the present invention;

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector comprising: 
a housing (12) having a plurality of
 contact receiving 
slots (16), at least some of the slots (16) extending 

entirely through the housing (12) with a uniform 
straight general cross-sectional T-shape, each of the 

T-shaped slots (16) having a head section (18) and a 
base section (20) that form the general T-shape; and 

a plurality of one-piece spring contacts (14) fixedly 
connected to the housing (12) in the T-shaped slots 

(16), each contact (14) having a middle section (28) 
located in the head section (18) of one of the T-shaped 

slots (16) with retention arms (32a, 32b) extending from 
opposite sides of the middle section (28) across the 

height of the head section (18) to fixedly mount the 
middle section (28) in the head section (18), and a top 

section (30) having a contact area (40) deflectably 
located in the base section (20) and a pre-load tab (42) 

movably located in the head section (18). 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein ends (36) of the 
retention arms (32a, b) are pressed into the housing to 

form an interference fit. 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein the middle section 
(28) includes a broad section (34) that is wider than 

the width of the base section (20) to prevent the middle 
section (28) from entering the base section (20). 
A connector as in claim 1, wherein the top section (30) 
has two pre-load tabs (42) extending inside the head 

(18) section past opposite sides of the base section 
(20) such that the pre-load tabs (42) limit the location 

of the contact area (40) inside the base section (20). 
An electrical connector comprising: 
a housing (12) having straight, cross-section T-shaped 

slots (16) extending form a top (22) of the housing to a 
bottom (24) of the housing (12); and 

spring contacts (14) fixedly connected to the housing 
(12) in the T-shaped slots (16), the contacts (14) each 

having a bottom contact section (26) extending from the 
bottom (24) of the housing (12), a middle section (28) 

fixedly connected to the housing in a head section (18) 
of one of the T-shaped slots (16), and a top contact 

section (30) movably located in the T-shaped slot (16). 
A connector as in claim 1 or 5, wherein the housing (12) 
entirely encloses the T-shaped slots (16) except at a 

top surface (22) and a bottom surface (24) of the 
housing (12). 
A connector as in claim 5, wherein the middle section 
(28) includes a broad section (34) and retention arms 

(32a, b), the broad section (34) being located against 
the housing (12) adjacent a base section (20) of the 

T-shaped slot (16) at a junction (46) of the head 
section (18) to the base section (20). 
A connector as in claim 7, wherein the broad section 
(34) is wider than the base section (20) and the 

retention arms (32a, b) extend entirely across the 
height of the head section (28). 
A connector as in claim 8, wherein the retention arms 
32a, b) pierce into the housing at corners (44a, b) of 

the head section (18) distal from the base section (20). 
A connector as in claim 9, wherein the retention arms 
(32a, b) extend from the rest of the middle section (28) 

at angles of about 45Â°. 
A connector as in claim 5, wherein the top section (30) 
has a contact area (40) deflectably located in a base 

section (20) of the T-shaped slot (16) and pre-load tabs 
(42) deflectably located in the head section (18), the 

pre-load tabs (42) contacting the housing (12) at a 
junction (46) of the base section (20) with the head 

section (18) to limit the location of the contact area 
(40) in the base section (20).
