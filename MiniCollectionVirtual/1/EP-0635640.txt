<ABSTRACT>
A compressor includes a rotary drive shaft having a first end 
and a second end, both the e
nds being rotatably supported by 
opposing walls of a crank chamber defined in a casing and a 

swash plate tiltably mounted on the drive shaft and operably 
coupled with a piston in a cylinder bore. A rotation of the 

drive shaft results in a reciprocating movement of the piston 
for compressing refrigerant gas in a cylinder bore. A rotary 

member is secured to the first end which extends outside the 
casing. The rotary member supplies a power to the drive shaft 

from a power supply. A support member, disposed between the 
rotary member and the first end, protrudes outward from the 

casing. A first bearing, disposed between the support member 
and the rotary member, receives a thrust load and a radial 

load acting on the rotary member when the rotary member 
rotates. A second bearing, disposed between the casing and 

the second end, receives the radial load acting on the rotary 
member when the rotary member rotates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compressor according to the preamble of claim 1. In general, compressor units used in automobiles, trucks and 
the like are used to supply compressed refrigerant gas to the 
vehicle's air conditioning system. To maintain air 
temperature inside the vehicle at a level comfortable for the 
vehicle's passengers, it is important to utilize a compressor 
whose displacement amount of the refrigerant gas is 
controllable. One known compressor of this type controls the 
inclined angle of a swash plate, tiltably supported on a 
rotary shaft, based on the difference between the pressure in 
a crank chamber and the suction pressure, and converts the 
rotational motion of the swash plate to the reciprocal linear 
motion of each piston.  
 In the conventional compressor, an electromagnetic clutch is 
provided between an external driving source, such as the 
vehicle's engine, and the rotary shaft of the compressor. 
Power transmission from the driving source to the rotary shaft 
is controlled by the ON/OFF action of this clutch. At the 
time the electromagnetic clutch is activated or deactivated, 
the clutch's action generates a shock generally detrimental 
not only to the compressor but also the overall driving 
comfort experienced by the vehicle's passengers. In addition, 
the integration of the clutch with the compressor increases 
the overall weight of the compressor. To solve the above shortcomings, Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 63-183277 discloses a variable displacement 
swash plate type compressor which does not employ an 
electromagnetic clutch for transmitting power from the 
external driving source to the compressor. In this compressor, a pair of bearing members support a rotary 
shaft having a pulley secured thereto for power transmission 
from an external driving source. One of the bearing members 
is provided in a cylinder block while the other bearing member 
is provided in the housing which defines a crank chamber. The 
stable support of the rotary shaft results in the reduction 
of the vibration and noise of the compressor. This is 
achieved by increasing the distance between the bearing member 
pair. According to the structure in which the rotary shaft  
 
is supported in the housing, however, the distance between the 
bearing member pair cannot be increased unless the entire 
length of the compressor is increased.  
 According to the document DE 40 02 196 A1 there is disclosed 
a compressor according to the preamble of claim 1. This 
compressor
