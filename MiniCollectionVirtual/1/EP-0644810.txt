<ABSTRACT>
For the purpose of cutting pipes, preferably welded pipes in conjunction with welding the pipes in a welding machine, and for the purpose of cutting the pipes at a rate determined by the welding machine, at the same time as a pipe (11) is cut in a cutting position by a raisable and lowerable cutting device (20), the next pipe to be cut is fed to a pipe collecting position which is displaced in relation to the cutting position, such that when the cutting device (60) returns to its starting position upon completion of a cutting operation, the pipe is advanced one step to the pipe cutting position while further pipe is advanced to the pipe collecting position at the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and machine
for cutting pipes, or piping, and then particularly for
cutting welded pipes, or piping, in the vicinity of a
pipe welding machine.Pipe welding machines for continuously welding pipes, or
tubes, have undergone very rapid development in recent
years, and present day welding machines are capable of
handling 200 m of piping, per minute in the case of
piping of smaller dimensions, and can be expected to
reach a future capacity of up to 300 m of welded piping,
or tubing, per minute.For reasons of productivity, it has been found advangeous,
and in many cases even necessary, to effect at
least one cutting operation in direct connection with
the welding machine, and in order not to limit the
capacity of the welding machine in this case, the cutting
equipment used must have at least the same capacity
as the welding machine, although pipe cutting equipment
which will satisfy these capacity requirements is not
yet commercially available.It is therefore the object of this invention to solve
the aforesaid problem and to provide a pipe cutting
method and a pipe cutting machine which will enable
piping, or tubing, to be cut in direct connection with
welding machines without reducing the capacity thereof,
i.e. at a rate which corresponds at least to a pipe
welding capacity of up to 300 m of pipe per minute, or
higher.This object is achieved with the method and machine
according to the invention, having the characteristic 
features set forth in claims 1 and 7
respectively.The invention will now be described in more detail with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures
1 and 2 illustrate schematically a side view and a top
view respectively of an inventive pipe cutting machine,
Figure 3 is a section view of a cutting unit included in
the cutting machine, said view being taken generally on
the line III-III in Figure 1; Figure 4 is a view from
above taken generally on the line IV-IV in Figure 3;

generally on the line VI-VI in Figure 1; Figure 7 is a
sectional view taken generally on the line VII-VII in
Figure 5; and Figure 8 is a section view of part of a
jaw chuck included in the arrangement.The illustrated cutting machine includes at least one
cutting unit, generally referenced 1, and a plurality of
support trestles 2 on each side of the cutting unit 1,
wherein the support trestles on the

<CLAIMS>
A method for cutting pipes, preferably welded pipes
in connection with welding and roughly cutting said

pipes, 
characterized
 in that at the same
time as a pipe (11) is cut in a cutting position by a

raisable and lowerable cutting device (60), the next
pipe to be cut is fed to a pipe collecting position

which is displaced through 180째 in relation to said
cutting position in a rotatable device in the form of a

jaw chuck (20), so that when the cutting device (60)
leaves said cutting position during its return upon

completion of a cutting operation the pipe is moved
forward one step to said pipe cutting position while, at

the same time, a new pipe is fed to the pipe collecting
position, by rotation of the jaw chuck through 180째.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that a pipe (11) is held in the pipe
collecting position and also in the pipe cutting position

by a pair of jaws (17, 18), and in that jaws (17,
18) located in the cutting position are opened when the

cutting device (60) leaves the pipe (11) during its
return upon completion of a cutting operation.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that a pipe (11) fed to the pipe
collecting position is displaced longitudinally into

abutment with a reference surface (47) which determines
the length into which the pipes are cut.
A method according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized

in that when the jaws (17, 18)
located in the cutting position are opened, the cut pipe

(11) is released down onto a feeder (13) located in an 
upper position, for transportation of the pipe away from

the cutting position.
A method according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized

in that a pipe fed to the collecting
position is clamped firmly between the jaws (17, 18) in

said collecting position subsequent to having moved the
pipe longitudinally such that one end of said pipe is in

abutment with said reference surface (47).
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that the pipes are
fed into said collecting position perpendicularly to

their longitudinal axes.
A machine for cutting pipes, preferably welded pipes
in connection with welding and roughly cutting said

pipes, comprising at least one cutting unit (1) which
includes a cutting device (60), and a number of support

trestles (2) located on each side of each cutting unit
(1), 
characterized
 in that there is
mounted on each support trestle (2) and on each cutting

unit (1) a rotatable device (20) in the form of a jaw
chuck comprising two jaw pairs (17, 18) which can be

displaced relative to one another through an angle of
180째, of which jaws the one jaw (18) can be moved towards

and away from the other jaw (17); in that the jaw
chuck (20) can be rotated between two positions displaced

through 180째 for transfer of a pipe (11) received
in a pipe collecting position to a cutting position in

which said pipe is cut by means of the cutting device
(60) of said cutting unit into intended lengths, and for

receiveing the next pipe to be cut in said collecting
position at the same time.
A machine according to Claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that it includes means (49) for moving

a pipe (11) fed to said collecting position in its
longitudinal direction into abutment with a reference

surface (47) which determines the lengths into which the
pipe is cut.
A machine according to any one of Claims 7-8,

characterized
 in that it also includes a
feeder (11) which functions to feed a pipe into the pipe

collecting position and to discharge a pipe cut in said
cutting position from said machine.
