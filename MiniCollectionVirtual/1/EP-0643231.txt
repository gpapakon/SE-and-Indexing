<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fasteners for aircraft
parts or the like. More particularly, the present invention
relates to the provision of an anchor nut mount that positions
an anchor nut for connection to a threaded bolt for fastening
or attaching two aircraft structures together.An anchor nut mount is a tool for securing a fastener nut
or anchor nut in place. It is used in combination with a
threaded bolt to secure a first structure, such as an aircraft
wall or cover panel, to a second structure, such as an aircraft
frame. While the present invention can be utilized to fasten
many types of structures together in a variety of applications,
for purposes of illustration, the present invention shall be
discussed with reference to aircraft/aerospace applications.The nut mount is secured about a fastener hole in the first
aircraft structure, and the anchor nut is secured to the nut
mount. A typical device used for securing the anchor nut to
the nut mount is a spring clip. The spring clip is mounted to
the nut mount at the same time the anchor nut is mounted to the
nut mount. A threaded bolt is inserted through the second
aircraft structure, through the fastener hole in the first
aircraft structure, and through a bolt-receiving hole in the
nut mount. The threaded bolt is screwed into the anchor nut
and tightened to secure the two aircraft members together.U.S. Patent No. 5,096,349 of Landy et al., issued March 17,
1992, and entitled, "Nut Mounting Grommet," discloses an anchor
nut mounting device that is mounted to a wall, for securing an
anchor nut according to the preamble of claim 1. The device is a grommet and includes a tubular
shank retainer that closely fits into a circular opening in the
wall of a structure. A nut mount is formed integral with the
tubular shank retainer and is adapted to receive the anchor nut
following securement of the grommet to the wall. The nut mount 
includes a base plate having a circular opening that is aligned
with the tubular passageway of the tubular shank retainer. The
nut mount is in the form of a tubular cup having a sidewall
that is longer than the anchor nut. The end portion of the
tubular cup is deformed inwardly to block removal of the anchor
nut from the cup.Another known construction for an anchor nut assembly
includes a base plate having a hole therein for receiving the
threaded end of a bolt. The base plate includes an additional
rivet hole on each side of the bolt hole for riveting the base
plate to the wall. The base plate includes a pair of upright
sidewa
