<ABSTRACT>
A radial piston pump of the type, in which an excentric rotor is 
adapted to cause the pistons to perform a reciprocating movement 

within radial cylinders in a pump body, said cylinders being, on one 
hand, via a lateral suction opening, connected to a liquid reservoir 

and having their radial outer ends each connected - through a 
connecting opening that accommodates a pressure valve - to a 

circumferentially located pressure passage, the pressure valves being 
pressed on seats within the respective connecting openings by means of 

at least one common resilient ring member that is located within the 
circumferential passage under tangential pre-tension, an annular wall 

portion surrounding the pump body to overlie and cover said 
circumferential pressure passage in said valve body. According to the 

invention the circumferential pressure passage is outwardly sealed by 
an annular member of plastics material and of a substantially 

trapezium-shaped cross-section, the longer parallel side of the latter 
facing radially inwardly and comprising a circumferential groove for 

receiving the resilient ring member, said annular member being adapted 
to be introduced radially inwardly into said circumferential pressure 

passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radial piston pump as
defined in the first part of claim 1.Such a pump is disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift
1.453.663.With this well-known pump the annular wall portion
surrounding the pump body is intended to close the circumferential
pressure passage at the outer circumference
thereof. The tightness of the circumferential passage as a
pressure passage is completely determined by sealing rings
provided in circumferential grooves on either side of the
circumferential pressure passage.The invention aims at providing an improved pump of
the above type, which is suitable for higher pump pressures
(up to 1000 bar) and which is of a compact and lightweight
construction, which is of particular importance for
use in hydraulically operated tools.In accordance with the invention this aim is achieved
by the features defined in the second part of claim 1.Due to the trapezium-shaped cross-section of the
annular member of plastics material in its tension free
state, the annular member will tend to slightly bulge
convexly outwardly beyond the circumferential outer surface
of the pump body. The annular wall portion, however,
will cause the annular member of plastics material to
return to a flat shape (as seen in the axial direction),
due to which the annular member will be pressed with its
opposite end faces firmly against the opposite sidewalls
of the circumferential passage. In operation, the pressure
of the annular member of plastics material against the
sidewalls of the circumferential pressure passage will be
further increased by the pressure prevailing within the
inner circumferential groove of the annular member, said
pressure tending to bend the end wall portions on either
side of said groove axially outwardly.Further features of the invention are defined in
claims 2 and 3. The invention will be hereinafter further described by way of
example with reference to the accompanying drawing.
Fig. 1 shows an axial cross-sectional view through a radial
piston pump according to the invention, as seen along the line I-I in
fig. 2;fig. 2 represents a cross-section along the line II-II in fig.
1;fig. 3 is an enlarged longitudinal cross-secitonal view through
the left lower part of the device of fig. 1 andfig. 4 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the left upper
part of fig. 1.The annular pump body 1 is surrounded by an annular wall member
2 and has a number of radially directed pumping cylinders 3, in which
pistons 4 are mounted for a reciprocating movement.The pump body 1 confines a

<CLAIMS>
A radial piston pump of the type in which an eccentric
rotor (7, 8) is adapted to cause the pistons (4) to

perform a reciprocating movement within radial cylinders
(3) in a pump body (1), said cylinders (3) being, on one

hand, connected to a liquid reservoir (18) via a lateral
suction opening (20) and, on the other hand, having their

radial outer ends connected to a peripherally located
pressure passage (21) through a connecting opening that

accommodates a pressure valve (23), the pressure valves
being pressed on seats within the respective connecting

openings by means of at least one common resilient ring
member (24) that is located within the peripheral passage

(21) under tangential pre-tension, an annular wall portion
(2) surrounding the pump body (1) to overlie and cover

said circumferential pressure passage (21) in said valve
body (1), characterized in that the circumferential pressure

passage (21) is circumferentially and sealingly
closed by an annular member (31) of plastics material

which has - in its tension-free state - a substantially
trapezium-shaped cross-section, the longer parallel side

of which is facing radially inwardly and the opposite
oblique sides of which have been urged - in the process of

assembling whereby the annular member has been caused to
enter radially inwardly into said peripheral pressure

passage (21) - to conform to and thereby exert pressure
onto the opposite side walls of said passage, a circumferential

groove being provided in said longer parallel side
for receiving said at least one resilient ring member (24).
A radial piston pump according to claim 1, characterized
in that the bottom of the peripherally located

passage (21) is, at a location between two adjacent cylinders
(3), connected to a passage (28) that extends

radially inwardly and is, in turn, connected to an axial
passage that leads to a pressure conection (29).
A radial piston pump according to either of claims 1
and 2, characterized in that the resilient ring element

(24) is an O-ring.
