<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reproducing apparatus
and more particularly to a reproducing apparatus having
tracking control means for controlling the position
of a reproducing head relative to a recording medium.EP-A-0 040 066 discloses an apparatus for reproducing
signals of a plurality of channels from a recording
medium having the signals of plural channels recorded in
parallel tracks with different azimuth angles which
comprises a plurality of head means, a plurality of
extracting means for extracting specific signals from the
signals reproduced by the head means, detecting means for
detecting a phase difference between the specific signals
and tracking control means responsive to the phase
difference. The signals of plural channels respectively
include digital signals, and the plurality of extracting
means respectively includes phase-locked loops which are
arranged to generate clock signals in synchronism with
clock signal components of the digital signals.Other known magnetic 
recording/reproducing apparatuses employ five different
tracking control methods, which are as follows:
(1) CTL (control) method: A control signal
of a given frequency is recorded along the edge of a
magnetic recording tape and a tracking control signal
is obtained by reproducing this control signal. (2) Pilot signal superimposing method: A
pilot signal of a low frequency is frequency superimposed
on a main information signal and a tracking control signal
is formed according to the pilot signal when the pilot
signal is reproduced. (3) Area dividing pilot signal method: A
pilot signal is recorded in a recording area other than
that of a main information signal and a tracking control
signal is formed according to the pilot signal when the
pilot signal is reproduced. (4) Index tracking method: A tracking control 
signal is formed according to a phase difference between
a phase detection signal indicative of the phase of a
rotary head and a horizontal synchronizing signal included
in a reproduced signal. This method has been disclosed
in "Television Society Technical Report", Vol. 11, No. 14,
pages 13 - 18, dated August 31, 1987. (5) Envelope detection method: A head is
vibrated and a tracking control signal is formed according
to the envelope level of a signal reproduced by the head.However, the above-stated methods (1) to (5)
respectively have the following shortcomings:
(1) In the CTL method:
(i) This method necessitates the use of
an additional CTL (control) track and a CTL head. (ii)
Since a period through which tracking
