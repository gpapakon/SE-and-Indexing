<ABSTRACT>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image forming 
apparatus, comprising: a sheet feed mechanism (3) for 

picking up stacked cut sheets (68,69) one at a time from 
a single sheet feed position (P2) and for feeding each 

sheet to an image recording portion; a sheet feed unit 
(10) which is vertically movable relative to the sheet 

feed mechanism (3) and to which a cassette (K) 
containing cut sheets (69) may be attached in a 

detachable manner; a sheet feed table (50) which is 
vertically movable within the sheet feed unit (10) and 

which carries a large number of cut sheets (68); a 
cassette presence detector (114,100a) for detecting the 

presence and absence of the cassette (K) on the sheet 
feed unit (10) and for outputting a signal indicating 

either the presence or the absence of the cassette (K); 
a cover (67) swingingly furnished on the sheet feed unit 

(10) for covering the opening thereof through which cut 
sheets are loaded and unloaded and through which the 

cassette (K) may be attached and detached to and from 
the sheet feed unit (10); a cover detector (115) for 

outputting a detection signal indicating the swinging 
status of the cover (67).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cut sheet feeder 
for use with the image forming apparatus such as a copier 
or a printer, the feeder feeding the apparatus with cut 
sheets of recording paper. The image forming apparatus is most often used to 
record images on a large number of cut sheets of the same 
size which are fed continuously. But occasionally, it is 
desired to interrupt the ongoing process of image 
printing involving many cut sheets so as to insert image 
printing of a different kind typically on a smaller 
number of sheets. Some of the conventional cut sheet 
feeders for use with the image forming apparatus have 
mechanisms that meet the requirements for the on-demand 
inserted printing. Such conventional cut sheet feeders (see e.g. US-A-4 660 820) have a 
plurality of sheet feed mechanisms positioned near the 
sheet feed table or sheet cassette assembly, each 
mechanism comprising its dedicated pick-up rollers, guide 
plates and other related parts. When the operator  
 
selects a desired sheet type, the corresponding sheet 
feed mechanism is activated. The activated mechanism 
picks up cut sheets one by one from the applicable sheet 
feed table or from the corresponding sheet cassette and 
feeds them into position inside the image forming 
apparatus. The conventional cut sheet feeder of the above-mentioned 
type has as many sheet feed mechanisms as the 
number of the sheet feed tables or the sheet cassettes 
that are mounted in advance of feed operation. The cut 
sheet feeder also has a plurality of sheet transport 
routes for guiding cut sheets from the multiple storage 
locations via rollers to a common feed position. These 
features combine to make the cut sheet feeder bulky, 
complex, and thus prone to feed-related troubles. In view of these drawbacks of the prior art, the 
inventor of this invention came up with a cut sheet 
feeder having a single sheet feed mechanism to which any 
one of a plurality of sheet feed tables carrying many cut 
sheets or of sheet cassettes containing different sizes 
of cut sheets is positioned as desired. But because the cut sheet feeder of the above 
type requires one of its sheet feed tables or sheet 
cassettes to be moved to a single sheet feed position, 
arrangements need to be made so that one table or 
cassette will not interfere during movement with any 
other table or cassette. In addition, this cut sheet  
 
feeder needs to be constructed so that cut sheets on the 
sheet feed table or in the sheet cassette selected will 
be fed quickly, simply

<CLAIMS>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus, comprising: 


a sheet feed mechanism (3) for picking up stacked cut 
sheets (68, 69) one at a time from a single sheet feed position (P2) 

and for feeding each sheet to an image recording portion; 
a sheet feed unit (10) which is vertically movable 
relative to said sheet feed mechanism and to which a 

cassette (K) containing cut sheets (69) may be attached in a 
detachable manner; 
a sheet feed table (50) which is vertically movable 
within said sheet feed unit and which carries a large 

number of cut sheets (68); 
cassette presence detection means (100a, 114) for detecting 
the presence and absence of a cassette on said sheet feed 

unit and for outputting a signal indicating either the 
presence or the absence of said cassette; 
a cover (67) for covering said sheet feed 
unit, said cut 

sheets on the sheet feed table being loaded and unloaded and the 
cassette being attached to and detached from said 

sheet feed unit by opening the cover; 
cover detection means (115) for outputting a detection 
signal indicating a cover opening status; 
mode establishment means (100b) for outputting a mode 
signal establishing one of two modes, a cassette feed 

mode involving said cassette for sheet feed and a table  
 

feed mode involving said sheet feed table carrying a 
large number of cut sheets; and 
mode control means (100f), when said cover detection 
means outputs a detection signal indicating the closed 

status of said cover, for controlling the up-down 
movement of at least one of said sheet feed unit and said 

sheet feed table relative to said sheet feed mechanism in 
accordance with the detection signal from said cassette 

presence detection means as well as with the mode signal 
from said mode establishment means. 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said mode 

control means lifts at least said sheet food table up to 
said sheet feed position when, with said cassette 

presence detection means outputting the signal indicating 
the absence of said cassette, said cover detection means 

outputs the detection signal indicating the close status 
of said cover. 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said mode 

control means keeps stationary said sheet feed unit and 
said sheet feed table when said cover detection means 

outputs the detection signal indicating the opened status 
of said cover.  

 
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image 
forming apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 

sheet feed unit and said sheet feed table are connected 
via clutches (9a, 9b) to a motor (8) acting as a driving source, and 

wherein said mode control means controls the up-down 
movement of said sheet feed unit and said sheet feed 

table singly and in combination through the switching of 
said clutches.
