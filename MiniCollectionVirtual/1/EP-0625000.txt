<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a ceramic circuit board 
used to carry thereon such components as semiconductor integrated 
circuits (ICs) and chip components for establishing 
interconnection among them. The present invention more 
particularly pertains to a gold paste for use in the manufacture 
of ceramic circuit boards, to a ceramic circuit board which is 
formed using a gold paste of the invention, and to a 
manufacturing method thereof. A noble metal metalizing paste is known from US-PS-3,440,182. 
This paste comprises a noble metal powder, an inorganic binder 
powder and a V2O5 additive powder to improve the solderability, 
conductivity and/or adhesion properties of fired metalizings 
thereof on ceramic substrates. V2O5 additive according to US-PS-3,440,182 
may be a copper/vanadium oxide composition containing 
Cu2O and V2O5 in specified portions which oxide composition is 
preferably in a fusion-reacted form. According to this prior art 
document, the V2O5 has to be employed in admixture with a glass 
powder if V2O5 is used as the additive. The ceramic circuit board has lately attracted considerable 
attention because of its easiness of multi-layer interconnection 
and for its thermal expansion coefficient close to that of 
silicon of IC chips and because inner via conductors can be 
formed. These features of the ceramic circuit board contribute 
to increasing the packaging density of, for example, 
semiconductor ICs. Therefore, the ceramic circuit board now 
finds many applications in, for example, camera-built-in video 
systems with smaller circuits.  
 FIG. 3 cross-sectionally shows a ceramic circuit board which 
is formed using a conventional gold paste. An IC bare chip is mounted by a well-known mounting 
technique called COB (Chip-On-Board) on a surface of the ceramic 
circuit board of FIG. 3. In COB, IC bare chips are directly 
mounted on ceramic circuit boards. With the continuing 
miniaturization of electronic circuit components, this COB 
mounting technique plays an important role. The COB mounting  
 
technique is suitable for multi-layer interconnection. FIG. 3 shows a conventional ceramic circuit board using a 
usual gold paste as gold wiring material. This prior art board 
comprises a ceramic board 11, an IC bare chip 15, gold wiring 17, 
a gold wire 19, and a silver paste 20. The gold wiring 17, 
formed by subjecting a usual gold paste to a firing process in 
the air at temperatures of 800 °C to 900 °C, is electrically 
connected by the gold wire 19 to the IC bare chip 15
