<ABSTRACT>
A melanin that is soluble in an aqueous solution at a pH between 5 and 9 at a temperature of 0 to 100  DEG C. Advantageously, the melanin is capable of being filtered through at least a 0.45 micron size filter, and has molecular weight of greater than 10,000 kilodaltons. The melanin is useful for providing a naturally-appearing tan to mammalian skin and hair. Such melanin can be produced by combining dopachrome and an appropriate enzyme, or by incubating 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid alone or with 5,6-dihydroxyindole, or with 3-amino-tyrosine. The melanin is also useful for providing a sun-screen to mammalian skin and hair, to treat post-inflammatory hypo- and hyperpigmentation, to tint glass and plastic, to protect industrial materials against ultraviolet damage, and as a coloring agent in foodstuffs such as coffee, tea, soda, whiskey and liquors.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHETIC MELANINBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of Application Serial No. 674,489, filed March 25, 1991, now pending, which is a continuation of Serial No. 603,111 , filed October 25, 1990, now pending, which is a continuation of Serial No. 525,944, filed May 10, 1990, now pending.Field of the InventionThe present invention concerns the synthesis of soluble forms of melanin and their composition, and methods of using such compositions to provide a natural-appearing tan to mammalian skin and hair and to provide a sun-screen, to treat hypopigmentation, to tint glass and plastic, to provide color to foods and beverages, and to protect industrial materials against ultraviolet damage.Background InformationIn biology, melanins are heteropolymers consisting of L-dopa and its enzymatic derivatives. They are ubiquitous in living organisms and are produced throughout the zoological and botanical phyla. In mammalian skin, melanins are produced through enzymatic processes in specialized cells known as "melanocytes". Melanins are the pigments of mammalian skin and hair.Mammalian melanins are highly insoluble and can be dissolved (solubiiized) only through non-physiological treatments such as boiling in strong alkali, or through the use of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. Tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the melanin biosynthetic pathway, can catalyze the 

formation of melanin in a test tube using L-tyrosine, L-dopa or 5,6-dihydroxyϊndoIe as substrates; however, the product is an insoluble precipitate as described above.Ito, "Reexamination of the Structure of Eumelanin", Bfochimica et Biophvsica Acta. 883. 155-161, 1986, mentions that natural melanin may be a polymer of 5,6- dihydroxyindole and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxyIic add. Ito, however, does not teach or suggest combining these chemicals to form melanin.Ito and Nicol, "Isolation of Oligimers of 5,6-DϊhydroxyindoIe-2-carboxylϊc Acid from the Eye of the Catfish", Biochemical Journal. 143. 207-217, 1974, mention that oligimers of 5,6-dihydroxyindoIe-2-carboxylic add exist in nature, for example in the tapetum lucidum of the sea catfish (Arius felis). Ito and Nicol, however do not teach or suggest that these structures could be used as a form of soluble melanϊn.Palumbo, d'lschia, Misuraca, and Prota, "Effect of metal ion on the rearrangement of dopachrome", Biochimica et Biophvsica Acta. 925. 203-209, 1987, mention that the non-decarboxylatϊve rearrangement of dopachrome at physiological pH values, leading mainly to
