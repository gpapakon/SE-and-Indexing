<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and a method for automatically 
transferring by pushing and pulling a reagent module 

(100) on to and off of a rotor (34) of modules. A 
surface of the module and the transfer mechanism are 

co-operatively shaped with a loose-fitting tongue 
(300) and arcuate groove (202), both the tongue and 

groove having a curved extension along an arc 
concentric with the axis of rotation of the rotor, 

such that modules mounted on the rotor can be rotated 
off the transfer mechanism by sliding the tongue 

relative to the groove in a rotational direction. An 
additional groove (210) is provided at an angle to 

said arcuate groove, along which the tongue or arcuate 
groove, whichever is on the transfer mechanism, 

reciprocates to push or pull a module into or out of 

the rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
transfer mechanism and a method for automatically
loading and unloading reagent modules from a load
station into and off of a rotor, such as is used in a
wet assay chemical analyzer.It is known in wet assay analyzers to
provide cartridges of reagents to a rotor, by
inserting them along a radius of the rotor where they
are processed with the other cartridges likewise
inserted. Examples, are shown in, e.g.,
US-A-5 075 082 and US-A-5 219 526. However, previous
constructions have either required the insertion into
the rotor to be manual, as described in
US-A-5 075 082, or to be done by using a pusher which
has to be withdrawn afterwards before the rotor can
rotate, the pusher being effective only to load a
cartridge, and not to unload it, as shown in
US-A-5 219 526.Therefore, prior to this invention there has
been a need for automated means for insertion of
reagent cartridges into a rotor which is versatile
enough to both a) remain inside the rotor enclosure
during rotor rotation and b) act to withdraw a spent
cartridge as well as insert a new one.An analyzer transfer mechanism for reagent
cartridges has been devised which solves the above-noted
problems.More specifically, in accordance with one
aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
analyzer comprising a source of reagents and reaction
cuvettes, the analyzer including a rotor having an
enclosure and an axis of rotation, a drive for
rotating the rotor about the axis, the source 
comprising a removable module containing a reagent
container and a stack of cuvettes, the rotor including
receiving stations constructed to receive and engage
the modules, a load and unload station for receiving
and returning individual modules from and to an
operator, and transfer means for transferring an
individual module on the load station in a first
direction on to the rotor, characterized in that the
transfer means and the modules comprise between them,
a member with a projecting tongue on one of the
transfer means and the modules, and a co-operatively
shaped groove on the other of the transfer means and
the modules for reception of the tongue within it, the
groove being dimensioned to freely slideably
accommodate the tongue within it, said tongue and
groove having an extension in a direction that is
misaligned with the first direction, so that the
tongue and groove are effective to move an engaged
module on to or off of the rotor along the first
direction.In accordance with another aspect of the
present invention, there is

<CLAIMS>
An analyzer (10) comprising a source of reagents and reaction cuvettes (C), said
analyzer (10) including a rotor (34) having a periphery and an axis (35) of rotation, a

drive for rotating said rotor (34) about said axis (35), said source comprising a
removable module (100) containing a reagent container (B1, B2) and a stack of said

cuvettes (C) , receiving stations on said rotor (34) constructed to receive and engage
said modules (100), a load and unload station (L) for receiving and returning individual

modules (100) from and to an operator, and transfer means for transferring an individual
module on said station (L) in a first direction on to said rotor (34);

   characterized in that each of said modules (100) includes a surface, a
linear groove (210) part-way along the surface of said modules (100), and an arcuate

groove (202) in said surface to which said linear groove (210) extends generally
perpendicularly,

   so that said linear groove (210) can cooperate with guides (350, 352)
projecting from said receiving stations to direct the insertion of said module (100) onto

a receiving station along a prescribed path, and said arcuate groove (202) can cooperate
with an engaged tongue (300) of said transfer means as a module (100) is forced to

rotate by one of said stations over said tongue (300).
An analyzer (10) according to claim 1, wherein said arcuate groove (202) and
said linear groove (210) are separated from each other by a wall (212).
An analyzer (10) according to claim 1 or 2, further including releasable biasing
means for releasably engaging said modules (100) when they are fully inserted into said

rotor (34), said biasing means including a spring (360) having a constant effective to
hold a module (100) in position except when said transfer means withdraws a module

from said rotor (34).
An analyzer (10) according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said transfer
means comprises a tongue (300) and further including a drive constructed to reciprocate

said tongue (300) in said first direction, and guides (350, 352) projecting upwardly from 
each of said receiving stations to receive a module (100) along a path extending

generally on a radius of said rotor (34).
An analyzer (10) for processing modules of reaction cuvettes, said analyzer (10)
including at least one of said modules (100), a rotor (34) for holding said modules (100)

at stations so that said modules (100) are generally aligned with a rotor radius, a drive

between said tongue (300) and said groove (202), one against the other, the module
(100) is pushed or pulled, respectively, relative to said rotor (34), and when said tongue

(300) is freely slid within said rotor (34), all of said modules (100) can be rotated
without withdrawing said tongue (300) or groove (202) from the vicinity of said rotor
