<ABSTRACT>
A consumer electronics device such as a television receiver or a video recorder generally operates with a mains-supplied stand-by mode and a normal mode. During the stand-by mode, the device must be capable of recognising a command sent by a remote control unit and of switching the device to normal mode. On the other hand, the power consumption should be as low as possible during stand-by mode. The invention is based on the object of reducing the power consumption from the mains during stand-by mode in the ecological sense. According to the invention, a third mode is provided as ecological mode in which only the remote control receiver (5) and a filter (6) connected to its output are supplied with operating voltage. The filter (6) detects the reception of a code allocated to the device and thereupon activates the microprocessor (7) controlling the device. The device is preferably completely disconnected from the mains during stand-by mode and ecological mode and a battery (3) is connected to the remote control receiver (5) and filter (6). Particularly for television receivers and video recorders with stand-by mode.

Current supply circuit for a consumer electronics apparatus
having a mains powered standby mode and a normal mode, which modes

can be switched between by means of a remote control receiver (5)
whose output signals (c) are supplied to a microprocessor (7)

controlling the apparatus, characterised in that, a third mode is
provided as an economy mode in which only the remote control

receiver (5) and a filter (6) connected to its output are supplied
with operating voltage, that the filter (6) is constructed such

that it recognises whether a remote control signal having a code
allocated to the apparatus is being received and, in this case,

generates a first switching voltage (Us1) which activates the
generally switched-off microprocessor (7), and that the recognition

of the code allocated to the apparatus in the filter (6) is
effected by evaluating the edge slope, the pulse spacing and the

duration of the pulses received by the remote control receiver (5).
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, the
first switching voltage (US1) closes a switch (S1) located between

a mains rectifier (NG) and the microprocessor (7) for a short time,
which switch is thereupon held closed by a second switching voltage

(Us2) generated by the microprocessor (7) if the microprocessor (7)
recognises a realisable command in the supplied signal.
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, the
filter (6) contains a differentiating stage (C1, R1), a first

threshold value stage (12), an integrating member (C2, R3), a
second threshold value stage (13) and a monostable trigger stage

(14) whose output voltage (g) serves for the activation of the
microprocessor (7).
Circuit in accordance with Claim 1, 2, or 3, characterised in
that, the apparatus is disconnected from the mains during the third

mode and a battery (3) contained in the apparatus is connected to
the remote control receiver (5) and the filter (6). 
Current supply circuit for a consumer electronics apparatus
having a mains powered standby mode and a normal mode, which modes

can be switched between by means of a remote control receiver (5)
whose output signals (c) are supplied to a microprocessor (7)

controlling the apparatus, characterised in that, a third mode is
provided as an economy mode in which only the remote control

receiver (5) and a filter (6) connected to its output are supplied
with operating voltage, that the filter (6) is constructed such

that it recognises whether a remote control signal having a code
allocated to the apparatus is being received and, in this case,

generates a first switching voltage (Us1) which activates the
generally switched-off microprocessor (7), that the apparatus is

disconnected from the mains during the third mode and a battery (3)
contained in the apparatus is connected to the remote control

receiver (5) and the filter (6), and that a detector circuit (1, 2)
is connected to the mains input, which circuit detects the presence

or absence of the mains voltage (UN) and generates a third
switching voltage (Us3) that switches off the battery (3) from all

the components in the apparatus in the absence of mains voltage
(UN).
Circuit in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that, the
battery (3) is formed by a rechargeable accumulator and is

preferably arranged in a battery drawer.
Circuit in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that, a
voltage (UTVon) occurring only in the normal mode of the apparatus

is applied to the accumulator (3) via a charging path (9, 10).
Circuit in accordance with Claim 6 or 7, characterised in that,
a pulse stage (2) is connected to the battery (3) which stage, for

an excessively discharged battery (3), generates a third switching
voltage (Us3) that switches the apparatus into the standby mode

from the mains.
