<ABSTRACT>
Bubbles are allowed to flow in a groove (36) having a 
V-shaped section and ultrasonic waves are irradiated 

perpendicularly to the bottom of the groove (36). By 
the reflecting/focussing action due to the V-shaped 

side walls (38), the sound pressure is focussed on 
the bubbles, to thereby effectively suppress the 

bubbles difficult to be destroyed by the ultrasonic 
wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
liquefying bubbles, and particularly to an apparatus 
for liquefying bubbles which is suitable to improve 
the unit cost of liquid and to prevent the 
environmental pollution when a bubbling liquid is 
used to be circulated. Conventionally, when a bubbling liquid is used to be 
circulated, such a circulating pipe line as shown in 
Fig. 1 is generally employed. In this circulating pipe line, a bubbling liquid 8 is 
stored in a reserve tank 10, and took out from it by 
way of a feed nozzle 12 provided on the lower portion 
of the reserve tank 10. Subsequently, pressure of 
the bubbling liquid 8 is increased by a feed pump 14 
and the liquid is press-fed to a liquid service 
location 18 through a feed pipe line 16. The 
remaining portion of the liquid used at the liquid 
service location 18 is increased in pressure by a 
return pump 20 again, and is returned to the reserve 
tank 10 by way of a return pipe line 22. In such a circulating pipe line, the bubbling is 
mainly generated in the course from the liquid 
service location 18 to the return pipe line 22. 
Thus, the liquid containing bubbles is returned to 
the reserve tank 10, and accordingly, when the 
circulation of the liquid is continued, the space 
portion of the reserve tank 10 is filled with the 
bubbles, and then the bubbles overflow to the outside 
through openings 10A. The bubbles of the liquid, 
which overflow to the outside, is difficult to be 
suppressed, thus causing the environmental pollution.  Moreover, since the leakage is continued, the loss of 
the liquid becomes larger. As conventional techniques of suppressing bubbles, 
there has been mostly used a method of chemically 
suppressing bubbles using a bubble suppressing agent. 
In this method, however, components of the liquid are 
changed by the undesirable combination of a liquid 
and a bubble suppressing agent. Namely, there little 
exist such bubble suppressing agents as to 
effectively suppress bubbles without any adverse 
influence on the liquid. Moreover, there has been known a method of spraying a 
bubble suppressing liquid for destroying bubbles. In 
this case, water or the circulating liquid is used as 
the bubble suppressing liquid. However, when water 
is used, the liquid is diluted with water and cannot 
be reused, thus causing a large loss. Meanwhile, 
even when the circulating liquid itself is used, the 
reuse thereof is difficult because of the presence of 
the remaining fine bubbles. On the other hand, there have been
