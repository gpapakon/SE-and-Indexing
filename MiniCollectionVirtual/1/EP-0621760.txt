<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for mapping left ventricular endocardial activation during surgery provides a jointed support arm (12, 14, 16) for an electrode probe (24). The relative position of the probe is determined by measuring movement about the arm joints (18, 20, 22), and it is displayed automatically on a monitor throughout surgery together with the positions and relative timings of recorded electrograms, and anatomical reference points. On completion of a mapping procedure, the electrode probe may be substituted by a cryosurgical device, which may be returned to the required position on the map for the purposes of cryo-ablation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Endocardial Mapping ApparatusThis invention relates to mapping apparatus, and in particular to a device for charting left ventricular endocardial activation in surgery for ventricular tachycardia .Ventricular tachycardia is characterised by abnor¬ mal and rapid contraction of the heart muscle. This most commonly occurs following a heart attack, where the site of origin is an area of scar tissue on the left ventricle of the heart. The condition may be treated surgically by locating the origin of the tachycardia followed by local ablation. The mapping procedure may be carried out using an electrode to record electrograms at a number of points on the left ventricle, and comparing the timing of activation at each successive point with a reference ventricular electrogram or surface electrocardiogram. The relative timings of the electrograms are used to identify the area of interest, early activation relative to the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram indicating the origin of ventricular tachycardia. Location of the origin is thus time consuming, being largely down to trial and error, and so requires undesirably long operating times.Mapping of the kind described necessitates the 

 surgical opening of the left ventricle in order to introduce the electrode, and thus can have severe and undesirable effects on the function of the already-damaged left ventricle.Alternatively, an "array mapping" procedure may be used, in which a spaced array of electrodes positioned on the surface of a suitable vehicle is used to record the electrograms. Mapping techniques of this kind offer no means of determining the position of any particular electrode with respect to the ventricular anatomy, and accordingly the best estimate of the origin of ventri¬ cular tachycardia is the fixed but unknown position of that electrode on the array for which the electrogram indicates earliest activation. High energy ablation may accordingly be carried out using that electrode. The number of electrodes, and thus the accuracy of the technique, is limited by the space available.According to the invention there is provided endo¬ cardial mapping apparatus comprising releasably mounted electrode probe means for producing electrograms of endocardial activation, movable support means on which the probe means may be mounted for use, measuring means by which the relative position of the probe means may be determined, means for recording the electrograms and display means for visually mapping the instant position 

 of the probe means and the positions
