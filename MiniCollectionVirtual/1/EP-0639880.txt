<ABSTRACT>
During operation, DC arc furnaces (8) generate undesired reactive load fluctuations, which are compensated by means of a reactive power compensator (31). An AC power controller (28) of the reactive power compensator (31) is controlled as a function of a stabilisation striking angle signal ( alpha St), which is controlled by a function generator (26) as a function of a desired reactive power signal (Qsoll8), a reactive power actual value signal (Q8) of the arc furnace (8) and a filter reactive power signal (QF), corresponding to the reactive power of filter branches (4, 4'). The desired reactive power signal (Qsoll8) is formed by means of a phase angle regulator (35) as a function of a total current intensity (i33), which includes not only the actual current value (iist) of the arc furnace (8) but also the current of the filter branches (4, 4') and the current of any auxiliary devices.
