<ABSTRACT>
A correction device for correcting the deviation of light 
beams of a primary scanning direction used for an image 

forming apparatus in which a plurality of light beams are 
simultaneously scanned on a recording medium in the primary 

scanning direction so that a plurality of lines are 
simultaneously recorded. The correction device includes a 

plurality of beam detectors, the number of which corresponds 
to the number of beams of light, are disposed in a scanning 

region in parallel with the primary scanning direction. Only 
one light beam is incident upon each beam detector, and a 

difference of detection time between the plurality of beam 
detectors is detected by a same beam detection interval 

detector. A beam detection controller controls so that one 
different beam of light is selectively incident upon each beam 

detector. A different beam detection interval detector 
detects a time difference between the beam detector by which 

different light beams are detected. In accordance with the 
time difference detected by the same beam detection interval 

detector and also the time difference detected by the 
different beam detection interval detector, a deviation time 

calculator calculates the deviation of a plurality of light 
beam of the primary scanning direction. In accordance with 

the time calculated by the deviation time calculator, a 
deviation corrector controls the phase of printing clock for  

 
the image formation conducted by the plurality of light beams 

and also controls a timed relation of the start of image 

formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a correction 
device for correcting the deviation of laser beams of the 
primary scanning direction used for an image forming 
apparatus. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a correction device for correcting the 
deviation of laser beams of the primary scanning direction 
used for an image forming apparatus in which a plurality 
of beams of light simultaneously conduct scanning so that 
a plurality of lines can be simultaneously recorded. In an image forming apparatus, a laser beam 
modulated in accordance with an image signal is reflected 
on a rotational polygonal mirror so that the laser beam 
scans on a recording  
 
medium. In order to increase the recording speed in the above 
image forming apparatus, a plurality of laser beams are used 
and a plurality of lines are simultaneously recorded. The 
above construction is well known. However, in the case where a plurality of laser beams 
simultaneously conduct scanning, the scanning position of the 
plurality of laser beams are deviated in the primary scanning 
direction. Accordingly, it is impossible to conduct image 
formation accurately and stably. In order to solve the above problems, the following 
technique is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Open to 
Public Inspection No. 188713/1990: 
Positions of a plurality of laser beams of the primary 
scanning direction is intentionally deviated beforehand, and a 
positional relation of the scanning position of each laser 
beam is investigated to be made clear. Then, a 
synchronization signal corresponding to each of the laser 
beams is generated, and recording operation of each laser beam 
is controlled in accordance with the corresponding 
synchronization signal. However, when the positional relation between the 
scanning positions of laser beams has collapsed, it is 
difficult to obtain an accurate synchronization signal 
corresponding to each laser beam. Therefore, it is necessary 
to improve the mechanism by which a semiconductor laser is 
mounted, and further it is necessary to make the mount  
 
mechanism of heat resistant material so that the positional 
relation of the scanning position of a plurality of laser 
beams can be maintained. For this reason, the cost of the 
apparatus is increased. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
correction device of laser beam deviation of the primary 
scanning direction used in an image forming apparatus in which 
a plurality of light beams simultaneously conduct the scanning 
operation
