<ABSTRACT>
A free-piston engine having a fluid pressure unit comprises a cylinder (1) and a piston (2) arranged within the cylinder (1) and reciprocating therein between the bottom dead centre and the top dead centre. The piston (2) includes a plunger-shaped piston extension (8) cooperating with the fluid pressure unit. This fluid pressure unit is equipped with an auxiliary means for moving the piston in a direction to its bottom dead centre. This auxiliary means comprises a connecting channel adapted to communicate a liquid pressure source with a room in which the plunger-shaped piston extension (8) extends and which room is closed on one side by an axial face of the piston extension which is directed such that, by pressure loading the axial face, the piston (2) is moved towards the bottom dead centre. According to the invention said axial face is formed on a ring (45) slidably arranged on the plunger-shaped extension (8), said plunger-shaped extension comprising a stop adapted for engagement by the ring (45) when it is moved for displacing the piston (2) to its bottom dead centre.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a free-piston engine 
having a fluid pressure unit, comprising a cylinder and a 
piston arranged within the cylinder and limiting one side of a 
combustion room, said piston reciprocating within the cylinder 
between a first position in which the volume of the combustion 
room in the cylinder is at a maximum and a second position in 
which the volume of the combustion room in the cylinder is at 
a minimum, the piston including a plunger-shaped piston 
extension cooperating with the fluid pressure unit, said fluid 
pressure unit being equipped with an auxiliary means for 
displacing the piston in a direction to its first position, 
said auxiliary means comprising a connecting channel adapted 
to communicate a liquid pressure source with a room in which 
the plunger-shaped piston extension extends and which room is 
closed on one side by an axial face of the piston extension 
which is directed such that, by pressure loading this axial 
face, the piston is moved towards the first position. In a known embodiment of such a free-piston engine 
having a fluid pressure unit (see EP-A-0 254 353), said axial 
face is formed on the plunger-shaped piston extension and the 
connecting channel of the room of the auxiliary means is 
connected to a low pressure container during normal operation. 
In a situation in which the auxiliary means should be used for 
bringing the piston to its bottom dead centre, such as with a 
so-called "misfiring", a two-way valve in the connecting 
channel is switched such that the room is communicated through 
the connecting channel with a source of higher pressure, such 
as a compression pressure accumulator. This prior art free-piston engine has the 
disadvantage that during normal operation with each 
compression and expansion stroke of the piston, the reduction 
and enlargement of the volume of the room cause hydraulic 
liquid to be forced out from and sucked-in again into said 
room. This leads to great displacements of hydraulic liquid 
adversely affecting the efficiency of the free-piston engine. 
Also, at the start of the expansion stroke of the vehicle, 
where the piston acceleration is very great, cavitation is  
 
caused in the hydraulic liquid sucked-in into said room 
because this hydraulic liquid cannot follow the acceleration 
of the axial face formed on the piston. This cavitation is 
highly undesirable because of the detrimental effects caused 
thereby, such as vibrations and erosion. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
