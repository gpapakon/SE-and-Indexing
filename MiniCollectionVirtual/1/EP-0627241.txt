<ABSTRACT>
A cardiac pacemaker has a multiplexed switched 
capacitor amplifier (125) used to develop a first target 

level to regulate the level of the pacing stimulus, and a 
second target level for comparison with the supply voltage 

level of the pacemaker as a measure of the point at which 
the pacemaker requires replacement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to artificial
cardiac pacemakers, and more particularly to an implantable
bradycardia pacemaker having switched capacitor amplifier
circuits for various functions, including sensing of cardiac
activity, providing a voltage reference in conjunction with
such sensing, and voltage regulation.In the normal human heart, the sinoatrial (S-A) node
is the primary natural pacemaker by which rhythmic electrical
excitation is developed. The cardiac impulse generated at
the S-A node is transmitted to the atrial chambers at the
right and left sides of the heart. In response, the atria
contract, pumping blood from those chambers into the
respective ventricular chambers. The impulse is transmitted
to the ventricles through the atrioventricular (A-V) node,
which imposes a delay, and via a conduction system comprising
the bundle of His, the right and left bundle branches, and
the Purkinje fibers. In response, the ventricles contract,
the right ventricle pumping unoxygenated blood through the
pulmonary artery to the lungs and the left ventricle pumping
oxygenated (arterial) blood through the aorta and the lesser
arteries to the body.The right atrium receives the venous (unoxygenated)
blood from the upper part of the body (head, neck and chest) 
via the superior vena cava, or upper great vein, and from the
lower part of the body (abdomen and legs) via the inferior
vena cava, or lower great vein. The blood oxygenated by the
lungs is carried via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium.This action is repeated in a rhythmic cardiac cycle
in which the atrial and ventricular chambers alternately
contract and pump, then relax and fill. One-way valves along
the veins, between the atrial and ventricular chambers in the
right and left sides of the heart (the tricuspid valve and
the mitral valve, respectively), and at the exits of the
right and left ventricles (the pulmonary and aortic valves,
respectively) prevent backflow of the blood as it moves
through the heart and the circulatory system.The S-A node is spontaneously rhythmic, and the
normal cardiac rhythm originating therefrom is termed sinus
rhythm. Disruption of the natural pacemaking and propagation
system occurs as a result of aging or disease, and is
commonly treated by artificial cardiac pacing. The
artificial pacemaker is implanted to deliver rhythmic
electrical to the heart as necessary to effect stimulation at
the desired rate. Bradycardia pacers are designed to sense
cardiac activity at a rate lower than the normal sinus rate
ran
