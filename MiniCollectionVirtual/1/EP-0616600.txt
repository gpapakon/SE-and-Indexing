<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent fouling during a pyrolytic decomposition of hydrocarbons, where a plasma torch and a reaction chamber are utilized, there is supplied to the torch in its gaps, pipes and openings, together with in the reaction chamber in its walls a gas or vapour which contains oxygen in the form of a compound. CO2 or H2O in gas form are preferably used as the cleansing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for the removal of fouling of 
apparatus during the decomposition of hydrocarbons. During the process of pyrolytic decomposition of hydrocarbons 
into hydrogen and carbon, a complete dehydrogenization of the 
carbon will not always occur, with the result that deposits are 
very easily formed in the reaction apparatus, both in channels 
in torches, in the openings between the torch electrodes and in 
the actual reaction chamber. These deposits can be extremely 
hard and difficult to remove and they are particularly 
prevalent in the peripheral areas, i.e. on the walls, partly 
due to the fact that the temperature is usually lower there, 
thus leading to a more incomplete decomposition process as well 
as a greater tendency to form deposits. From US-4 101 639 is known a pyrolytic method for the production 
of carbon black. Water vapour is fed by tangential 
streams at a rate high enough to create a reliable vapour layer 
protecting the walls of the reaction chamber from high 
temperatures of the plasma stream. The vapour layer will also 
protect against a deposition of condensed carbon on the walls 
when hydrocarbon gases are used as the heat carrier to form the 
plasma stream. Such problems are particularly crucial in narrow openings, in 
pipes and channels which transport the hydrocarbon medium, such 
as in lead-in tubes, or in the gaps between electrodes, where 
there is the risk of some intrusion of carbon particles. These 
problems can lead to a complete blockage of the apparatus, thus 
causing the decomposition process to be interrupted or to 
operate in an unsatisfactory manner. For this reason a number 
of pyrolytic processes can only be conducted intermittently and 
not continuously, which makes the process considerably more 
expensive and may even make it unprofitable.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide a method 
whereby these problems can be avoided. A further object of the 
invention is to provide a method which thereby can also provide 
an increase in the yield and to some extent improve the process 
performed by means of the apparatus. These objects are achieved by a method which is characterized 
by the patent claim presented. In the invention there is introduced into a pyrolytic burner, 
and particularly a plasma torch, an atmosphere which does not 
influence the pyrolytic process, but which is capable of 
reacting with the carbon deposits or sediments and convert 
these into volatile materials. In this connection it can be 
especially
