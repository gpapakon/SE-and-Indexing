<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous coating 
composition providing a coat having good appearance, 
which is superior in coating workability (e.g. pinhole 
resistance and sagging resistance) and surface 
smoothness. Aqueous coating compositions are used for 
intercoating and base topcoating of automobiles. 
Heretofore, organic solvent type coatings have been 
exclusively used for automobiles. However, it is now 
strongly demanded to change from organic solvent type 
coatings to aqueous coatings in view of safety on coating 
process, reduction of environmental pollution and resources-saving. As the aqueous intercoating composition, for 
example, there have been known an aqueous intercoating 
composition comprising a carboxylic group-containing 
resin, an urethane bond-containing diol and resin 
particles (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-52973), 
a thermosetting aqueous coating composition 
comprising a polyhydric carboxylic acid resin, an amino 
resin, a linear low molecular weight polyester diol and 
an benzoin (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 4-93374) 
and the like. However, various problems are  
 
arisen when using them for intercoating. That is, surface smoothness and final appearance are 
not sufficient. Further, "pinhole" as a defective 
appearance caused by bumping of water during curing a 
coated film is liable to be arisen in comparison with a 
conventional organic solvent type paint. This phenomenon 
is observed in case that the film thickness is 20 to 40 
µm and it becomes the cause of deterioration of the final 
appearance. Further, water resistance of the coating 
containing the linear low molecular weight polyester diol 
is not sufficient. In general, a two coat/one bake coating process 
which comprises coating a metallic base paint containing 
a metallic pigment on a plate on which primer-coated and 
intercoated (referred to as topcoating), followed by wet-on-wet 
coating a clear paint without curing the metallic 
base coat, and then simultaneously curing the metallic 
base coating and clear coating, is used for coating 
automobiles. In the metallic base paint used for this 
process, a flake metal pigment (e.g. aluminum) is 
satisfactorily oriented so that an excellent appearance 
of the coated film can be obtained. Particularly, an aqueous metallic base coating 
composition comprising a water dispersant of an amide 
group-containing acidic resin and hydrophilic group-carrying 
polyurethane resin as a main component (Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
