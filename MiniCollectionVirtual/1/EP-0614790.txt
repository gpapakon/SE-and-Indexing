<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pretensioner for vehicle seat-belt systems, having a pyrotechnic gas generator (12) and a piston/cylinder unit (16, 20) mounted in a housing block (14). The piston (20) of the piston/cylinder unit (16, 20) is arranged at a first end (161) of the cylinder (16) and is connected to a pull cable (22), and through the gas pressure produced by the gas generator (12) is accelerated to the second end (162) of the cylinder (16), which end has a constriction. The piston/cylinder unit (16, 20) together with the housing block (14) and the gas generator (12) inserted therein form a pivotably mounted vehicle-sensitive inertia mass. According to the invention, there is arranged on the piston (20) a deformation element (46), which, when the piston (20) accelerates towards the second end (162) of the cylinder (16), is carried along by the piston (20) and on striking those wall parts of the cylinder (16) which form the constriction undergoes plastic deformation.

A belt pretensioner for vehicle safety belt systems, 
comprising a pyrotechnic gas generator (12) and a piston and 

cylinder unit (16, 20) secured in a housing block (14), 
whose piston (20) is arranged at a first end (161) of the 

cylinder and connected to a cable (22) and by the gas 
pressure produced by the gas generator (12) is accelerated 

towards the second end (162) of the cylinder (16), which has 
a constriction, the piston and cylinder unit (16, 20) 

constituting, with the housing block (14) and the gas 
generator (12) arranged therein, a pivotally mounted 

vehicle-sensitive inertial mass, characterized in that a 
deformable member (46) is arranged on the piston (20) which 

on acceleration of the piston (20) towards the second end 
(162) of the cylinder (16) is entrained by the piston (20) 

and is plastically deformed on impinging on the wall parts 
of the cylinder (16) which constite the constriction. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 1, characterized 

in that the piston (20) has an axial neck (201) with a 
reduced cross sectional area on the side facing the second 

end of the cylinder (16) and the sleeve-like deformable 
member (46) is slipped onto the neck (201) of the piston 

(20). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 
2, characterized in that the outer enveloping surface of the 

deformable member (46) is profiled.  
 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 2 or in claim 
3, characterized in that the inner enveloping surface of the 

sleeve-like deformable member (46) is profiled. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 3 or in claim 
4, characterized in that the profiled section is essentially 

constituted by ridges (52) extending in the axial direction 
of the cylinder (16). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the claims 
1 through 5, characterized in that the enveloping surface of 

the deformable member (46) is in cross section adapted to 
the inner enveloping surface of the cylinder (16). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the constriction is 

constituted by a frustoconical terminal part (18) of the 
cylinder (16) and in that the deformable member (46) is, at 

least in part, chamfered on its end facing the second end 
(162) of the cylinder (16) towards the second end (162) of 

the cylinder (16). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the fusion 

temperature of the material of the deformable member (46) is 
above the self-ignition temperature of the pyrotechnic gas 

generator (12). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that the deformable member (46) consists of a 

metallic solder-like material. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 9, characterized 
in that the deformable member (46) consists of a tin 

alloy.
