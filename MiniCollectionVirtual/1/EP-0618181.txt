<CLAIMS>
Process for the removal of water from a 
solution comprising water and at least one liquid compound 

other than water by azeotropic distillation of a 
water/ entrainer azeotrope, characterized in that the 

entrainer is selected from 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane, 
1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, 

1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and trifluoroethylene. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the liquid compound other than water contained in 

the solution is a hydrofluoroalkane. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the liquid compound other than water contained in 

the solution constitutes, at least in part, the entrainer. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the solution is a composition for 

cleaning, degreasing or drying articles. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the solution is a mixture of 

reaction products obtained during the production of a 
hydrofluoroalkane. 
Process for the production of a hydrofluoroalkane 
in which there is recovered a mixture of reaction products 

comprising, in solution, the hydrofluoroalkane and 
water, the said mixture is subjected to azeotropic 

distillation in the presence of an entrainer which forms 
an azeotrope with water, and a distillate containing the 

azeotrope and a liquid phase containing the hydrofluoroalkane 
are recovered from the distillation, characterized 

in that the entrainer is selected from 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane, 
1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, 

1,1,1-trifluoroethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
and trifluoroethylene. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the distillation is carried out in the presence of 

1 to 10 times the amount of entrainer which is strictly 
necessary to form the azeotrope.  

 
Process according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the entrainer is a constituent of the mixture. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the entrainer is the hydrofluoroalkane. 
Process according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the entrainer is added to the mixture. 
Process according to any one of Claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that the hydrofluoroalkane is 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane.
