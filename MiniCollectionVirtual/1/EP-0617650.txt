<ABSTRACT>
The application of solder to the fine structured catalyst supports in a catalytic converter can pose problems. The invention proposes that solder powder of a suitable particle size is first dispersed in a liquid mixture of binder and liquid, the gas-flow channels in the catalyst supports are flooded with this mixture and excess mixture then removed from the channels. The method is suitable for use in the manufacture of exhaust-gas catalytic converters for motor-vehicle engines.

<CLAIMS>
A method of brazing carrier bodies with flow passages, wherein 
the flow passges (10) are formed between mutually adjoining layers of 

corrugated or smooth and corrugated metal foils (1, 2) which are wound or 
layered to form the carrier body (3), wherein brazing powder of suitable 

grain size is deposited in brazing gaps (11) at the connecting locations 
between the metal foils to each other and/or the metal foils and the 

casing (4), wherein the brazing powder is firstly dispersed in a mixture 
of binding agent and fluid, the fluid mixture is caused to flow through 

the flow passags (10) of the carrier body (3), and thereafter excess 
mixture is removed from the flow passages (10) and then the carrier body 

(3) is brazed, characterised in that the method is applied to carrier 
bodies (3) of exhaust gas catalytic converters, wherein for the purposes 

of producing the flow of mixture through the carrier body (3) the carrier 
body is fitted into a flow conduit (7) which carries the mixture. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the excess 
mixture is removed from the flow passages (10) and that the carrier body 

is thereafter subjected to a drying operation. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the flow 
profile of the mixture is rendered uniform before flowing through the 

carrier body (3). 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that given 
regions of the carrier body (3) are excluded from a flow of the mixture 

therethrough.
