<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchange apparatus (10) is provided with an 
indirect evaporative heat exchange section (50) and a 

direct evaporative heat exchange section (90). A 
uniform temperature evaporative liquid is downwardly 

sprayed into the indirect section to indirectly exchange 
sensible heat with a hot fluid stream flowing within 

a series of enclosed circuits (54) which comprise the 
indirect evaporative heat exchange section. After the 

evaporative fluid descends through the entire indirect 
heat exchange section and absorbs heat, it is 

distributed across fill media within the direct 
evaporative heat exchange section for cooling. Separate 

streams of ambient cooling air are simultaneously drawn 
into each of the heat exchange sections to evaporatively 

cool the evaporative liquid flowing within each section. 
The water cooled in the direct heat exchange section is 

then collected in a sump (30) where it is allowed to mix 
and resultantly become uniform in temperature before 

being redistributed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
improved heat exchange apparatus such as a closed-loop
cooling tower, evaporative condenser, or wet air cooler.
When compared to other similarly sized and currently
commercially viable indirect evaporative heat exchange
products, the present invention is capable of achieving
greater heat transfer capability per unit size and cost.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a method of exchanging heat
between a fluid stream and an air stream as claimed in
claim 1.According to a second aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an apparatus for exchanging
heat between a fluid stream and an air stream as claimed
in claim 12. The present invention relates to a group of unique
combinations of separate indirect and direct evaporative
fluid heat exchange sections arranged in such manner
that a performance enhancing, initially uniform
temperature evaporative liquid is distributed across the
indirect heat exchange section.In accordance with the present invention, an
initially uniform temperature liquid is distributed over
the outside surface of an indirect heat exchange
section, which is comprised of a series of individual,
enclosed circuits for conducting a fluid stream to be
heated or cooled. When used as a closed loop cooling
tower or evaporative condenser, heat is indirectly
transferred from the fluid stream to the surrounding
film of evaporative liquid. Part of the heat retained 
by the evaporative liquid is directly transferred to an
air stream passing through the indirect evaporative heat
exchange section, while the remaining portion of heat is
stored as sensible energy, resulting in a temperature
increase to the evaporative liquid. The stored sensible
energy is then transferred in the direct evaporative
heat exchange section to a second, separate air stream
passing therethrough. The evaporative liquid draining
from the direct evaporative heat exchange section is
then collected in a sump and then pumped upwardly for
redistribution across the indirect evaporative heat
exchange section. When used as a wet air cooler, the
direct and indirect evaporative heat exchange sections
perform exactly as described above, except that now, the
fluid stream entering the circuits is initially cold.
Instead of releasing heat, as previously described, the
fluid stream indirectly absorbs heat from the air
streams passing through the direct and indirect
evaporative heat exchange sections. The heat
transferring processes are functionally
