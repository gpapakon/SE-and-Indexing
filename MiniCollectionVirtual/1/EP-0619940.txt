<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) made for instance of ceramic, 
terracotta, or plastic material, is capable of supporting 

conventional vessels (4) by means of a plate (3) which is 
provided with openings. The vessels have a top peripheral 

border (5) which protrudes with respect to the peripheral 
border of the container so that the vessels are raised from 

the bottom of the container. Water is placed at the bottom 
of the container, some strips of felt (9) or similar 

absorbing material is inserted into the vessel and reaches 
the bottom of the container so that water is transferred to 

the soil by capillary action and also by evaporation. The 
containers consist of three compartments; the upper 

compartment (7) containing the soil, the lower compartment 
(6) containing the water, and an intermediate compartment 

(24) forming an air chamber. The walls (the container (1), 
the plate (3), and the vessel(s) [4]
) containing the air 
chamber (24) act as an evaporation barrier. As water 

evaporates from the reservoir (6) it condenses along the 
walls containing the air chamber (24). Water is thereby 

reclaimed by the reservoir or is absorbed by the soil in the 
upper chamber (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to containers for
watering flowers and plants. A container having the features as set
forth in the preamble portion of claim 1 is known for example from
CH-A-466.630.The container according to the present invention has the
features as set forth in the characterising portion of claim 1A feature of the container according
an embodiment of
to the
present invention resides in the fact that it permits to
support one or more vessels for flowers, the bottom of the
vessel remaining raised with respect to the bottom of the
container so that the water introduced into the container
for humidifying the soil in the vessels remains always below
the bottom of the vessels thus avoiding the possibility that
roots rot by contact with water. Still another embodiment of the container is an
insulating humidifying air chamber. As water evaporates
from the reservoir, it is contained by the walls of the air
chamber (evaporation barrier). The air chamber provides air
and water (humidity) to the vessel containing the
soil. The air chamber also insulates the interior vessel
from external environmental temperature extremes.According to another embodiment of the invention,
a vessel for flowers or plants comprises in the interior a
peripheral rib on which a plate rests.The invention is further illustrated by reference,
to the accompanying drawings of which:
Fig. 1 is a cross section of the container with a
single vessel therein;Fig. 2 is an upper planar view of the same
container which for instance has a circular shape.Fig. 3 illustrates a container
(which forms no part of the present invention and)
of length greater 
than the width suitable for placing therein several vessels.Fig. 4 is a modification of the embodiment of Fig.
1 and shows a vessel with a protruding peripheral border
which rests directly on the border of the container which
contains water.Fig. 5 illustrates another type of container.Fig. 6 is a cross section of the container of Fig.
5.Fig. 7 illustrates in cross section the embodiment
of a circular vessel having inserted therein a separating
circular plate.Fig. 8 is a planar view of the circular plate of
Fig. 7 having openings.Fig. 9 is a perspective view of a vessel of
rectangular shape.
It is to be noted that Figure 3 and Figures 5-10 inclusive form no part
of the present invention and are solely for improved understandingFig. 10 is a planar view of the plate having
openings in the vessel of Fig. 9.As shown by way of a non-limited example in Figs.
1 and 2, the container consists of a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The combination of a container and a vessel for containing
flowers and/or plants, which comprises a container (1, 10)

having supporting means (2, 3) for supporting at least one
vessel (4) therein, said vessel having a bottom and being

adapted to contain in the interior thereof soil (7) for the
cultivation of said flowers and/or plants, said container being

adapted to have at the bottom thereof a predetermined amount of
water (6) having a level lower than the bottom of said vessel,

said combination further comprising humidifying means for
humidifying said soil in said vessel and comprising strips of

felt (9) or other suitable material being inserted in said soil
contained in said vessel and also being immersed in said water

and transferring water due to capillary action, whereby said
soil remains humidified for a substantial period of time,

characterised in that
said container being further provided with a cylindrical tube

(8) disposed at its bottom so that the level of water in said
container remains always fixed to a level lower than the bottom

of said vessel.
The combination according to claim 1 characterised in that
said supporting means for supporting at least one vessel within

said container above the level of water comprises at least one
plate (3) having at least one opening and resting on a border

(2) formed in the upper part of said container.
The combination according to claim 2, characterised in that
said at least one plate (3) has opening of equal or different

diameter, so that a plurality of vessels of differing sizes may 
be inserted in said container.
The combination according to claims 2 or 3, characterised in
that an air chamber (24) is created by the enclosed plate (3),

said vessel (4) and said container (1, 10), said air chamber
forming an evaporation barrier when water contained within said

container condenses.
The combinations according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that said at least one vessel (4) is disposed

entirely within said container, so that all the soil contained
in said vessel is humidified.
