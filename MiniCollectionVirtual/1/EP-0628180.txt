<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to aqueous
processable, photopolymerizable compositions having
superior flexibility while preserving important
properties for their use as permanent coatings for the
protection of printed circuitry.Photopolymerizable resist materials are known,
for example, from U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,469,982 and
3,547,730, which describe a film resist with a sandwich
structure in the form of a photopolymerizable layer
between a cover sheet and a temporary support. This film
resist can, for instance, be laminated on a copper base,
exposed imagewise and developed with organic solvents or
aqueous solutions, whereby a defined resist layer is
formed. Typically the copper base for a printed circuit
board is rigid, with limited flexibility of just a few
degrees such as the conventional copper-clad fiber-glass
epoxy laminates. More recently, printed circuits are
being prepared on highly flexible film substrates to
form electronic packages which may be folded and
refolded one or more times to fit a specified
configuration or a dynamic mechanical operation.The defined resist layer thus produced can now be
selectively etched, electroplated or treated with solder 
on the substrate. Particulary high demands are placed on
photoresist films if they are used as permanent coatings
that function as solder resists or masks. In this case,
the developed, photopolymerized layer must withstand
temperatures up to 300° C. without degradation, loss of
adhesion or accumulation of residues contained in or on
the molten solder. With the advanced technology of
today's printed circuit boards, it is important to have
the capability to photoimage a solder mask. According to
the current state of the art, such solder masks can be
made by spraying, coating or calendering liquid
compositions on a substrate or also by laminating a dry
film on a substrate.Due to the adverse environmental impact of
solvents, aqueous developable photopolymer systems with
fast development are now preferred. The use of
photopolymer resists with acid functions, primarily
carboxyl functions, is known to impart aqueous
processability. However these groups are
disadvantageous in many subsequent steps or events. In
the case of photoresists, delamination of the resist is
observed in alkali etching or gold plating, in the case
of solder masks, inadequate climatic resistance.
Modification of the carboxyl groups with melamine
compounds to overcome the named disadvantages is known
(EP 01 15 354 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,247, 621).The utilization of polymers
