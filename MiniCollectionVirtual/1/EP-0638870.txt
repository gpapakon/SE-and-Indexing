<ABSTRACT>
A system for storing a large amount of heterogeneous 
information in proper arrangement for facilitating 

utilization thereof by user, while allowing semantical 
retrieval to be realized even from vague fragmental information. 

The system can find application in document filing 
system for storing and managing documents, intelligent card 

management systems for storing and managing cards such as 
memorandum cards, or personal data base required for handling 

heterogeneous information. A method of expressing the 
facts constituting information in terms of "concepts" 

representing things and "relations" defined between the 
concepts internally of computer, and a method of inputting 

user's information to computer through dialogical procedure 
and retrieving desired information. Information stored 

internally of the computer architects internally a concept 
network. A part of the concept network is displayed in 

various forms such as hierarchical form based on subsumption 
relations between the concepts, hierarchical representation 

based on part-whole relation between the concept, a frame 
display
 of a single concept, and tabular representation of a 
set of concepts belonging to a given class. A method of 

browsing internally of the network by referring to the 
contents of the display. The user can thus easily know 

what kind of information has been stored internally of the 
computer, whereby he or she can perform inputting of new  

 
information and retrieval of desired information in 

facilitated and simplified manner. The relations stored 
internally of the computer are classified into "generic 

relationship" and "instance relation" representing 
individual facts, whereby generic framework of facts can 

be stored. The framework can be applied to concrete 
concepts through inheritance mechanism. The generic 

framework is displayed upon interaction with the user 
for allowing new information to be inputted and desired 

information to be retrieved in a facilitated and simplified 
manner. Retrieval by using semantic retrieval formula 

created internally through dialogical procedure is realized 
through inferring processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
storage and retrieval system which permits storage,
retrieval and display of such information as documents,
drawings, photographs and the like in such a manner in
which common users can easily manipulate the system for
the storage and/or retrieval of information.Heretofore, management of a data base which
permits storage and retrieval of an enormous amount of
information has been relied on those skilled in the art.
The information is available to the end user only through
the medium of experts. However, in accompaniment to the
development of small size storage devices of a large
capacity such as optical disks, there are realized document
filing systems for office use which can be directly
manipulated by the end users. Further, word processors
increasingly come into wide use. Under the circumstances,
there is an increasing tendency that a large amount of
documents are stored in electronic devices.Heretofore, the items such as documents are
managed in tabular form listing bibliographic data such as
identification names, titles and author's names attached to
the documents, while attempt is made to facilitate the 
retrieval of information by assigning keywords or
classification codes thereto. Nevertheless, there arise
problems mentioned below.In most of the computer file systems, the file
management is performed with the aid of identification
names (each composed of ca. 20 characters). However,
difficulty is often encountered in naming the document or
file so that it can be readily recalled. Besides, searching
the file on the basis of the character string which
constitutes the name while inferring the contents from the
name is an extremely difficult job even for the user who
has prepared the name himself.Since the bibliographic data are objective items,
registration thereof can be easily made. However, there
scarcely arises the situation in which the bibliographic
data are made use of as means for retrieval. Utilization
of the bibliographic data as the aid for the retrieval is
restricted to the rare case in which the document to be
retrieved is clearly known to the user as the source or
reference literature.In most cases of the retrieval of documents, the
title ambigously memorized by user or the contents thereof
provides a clue for the retrieval. To this end, keywords
and classification codes are employed. However, difficulty
is encountered already in assigning the keywords or
classification codes to the documents upon registration
thereof. In other words, it

<CLAIMS>
A method of information query in a concept-based information
retrieval system having a database which expresses

knowledges by employing concept relation models expressing
the knowledges by concepts and by relations defined between

the concepts, comprising the steps of

storing concept identification numbers and concept names
so that they are associated to each other, where the combination

of a concept identification number and a concept name
represents a concept node (C; 1010~1018),
storing subsumption relations (S; 1002, 1003) for all
concepts,
inputting a string of characters as the user's query to
designate one of said stored concepts,
displaying a list of concepts for guidance including
pairs of concepts and generic relations (R), wherein said

concepts and said relations are those connected to said
designated concept,
selecting one of said displayed concepts in response to
the user's input, to add a condition to said designated concept,

thereby producing a complex query, and
either repeating the previous steps to add more conditions
to said query, or conducting a search based on the

currently formulated query,
characterised
 by the further steps of

storing relations (R, r; 1004~1006) defined between
arbitrary ones of the concept nodes (C; 1010~1018), 
discriminating whether a given relation is a generic
relation (R) or an instance relation (r), the generic relation

defining kinds of relations which may exist between concept
nodes (C; 1010~1018), and the instance relation, which

is of the same kind as the generic relation, defining a
specific relation between two given concept nodes,
storing the names of all relations (R, r; 1004~1006),
performing a dialogical procedure with a user in order
to prepare a retrieval condition and display the result of a

retrieval,
displaying the available concept nodes (C; 1010~1018)
and relations (R, r) and generating an abstract concept

expression which is represented in terms of a combination of
two of the concept nodes and one of the relations as the

retrieval condition, by employing generic relation (R) data
in a dialogue of preparing the retrieval condition, and
executing a search by employing concept matching, using
the abstract concept expression as the search condition.
The method of claim 1, comprising of the further steps
of retrieving and displaying information searched by said

means for searching information.
