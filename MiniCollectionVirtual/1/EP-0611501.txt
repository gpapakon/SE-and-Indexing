<ABSTRACT>
Beam Compensation Methods pertain to the management of radio beams (11) which are generated by a constellation of satellites (S). These beams (11) are precisely controlled so that they illuminate ''Earth-fixed cells'' as opposed to ''satellite-fixed cells''. In previous satellite communication schemes, spacecraft which are not held stationary over one particular location on the Earth in geo-synchronous orbits fly over large regions of the Earth very rapidly. In a system that employs satellite-fixed cells, the ''footprint'' (10) of the radio beams (11) propagated by the spacecraft defines the zone on the ground called a ''cell'' which is illuminated by the spacecraft. This satellite-fixed cell moves constantly as the spacecraft moves around the globe. In sharp contrast, an ''Earth-fixed cell'' (14) is a stationary region mapped onto the surface of the Earth that has permanent fixed boundaries, just like a city or a state.

Spacecraft Designs for Satellite Communication System, 
published 13 May 1993. The specifications of the patent applications listed 
above are hereby identified by reference.  
 The present invention relates to the field of satellite communications. More particularly, 
this invention provides a method of assigning individual radio beams from a constellation of low 
Earth orbit satellites to delineated regions on the ground with fixed boundaries called "cells." 
This beam management system offers enhanced frequency coordination and communication 
reliability. The present invention substantially eliminates the problem of rapid "hand-offs" of a 
communication channel among the multiple beams of one satellite or between satellites as one 
satellite moves out of range of subscribers within the cell and another takes over to supply service 
to the cell. Current telephone services rely primarily on land lines and microwave repeaters to 
handle call traffic. Recent expansions of cellular networks have enhanced phone service by 
providing access to the land based system to customers using mobile phones in their vehicles or 
hand-held portable units. The increased capacity offered to the subscriber is relatively small 
compared to the number of subscribers using conventional fixed phones, since cellular service is 
limited to only those geographical regions that are densely populated. Cellular communication 
is often afflicted by poor performance when customers travel from one cell to another, or when 
they traverse the radio shadows projected by terrain or buildings. One previous attempt to bypass the limits of conventional communications networks 
utilizes a transportable telephone that employs a satellite dish several feet in diameter to 
communicate

A method of continuously allocating a plurality of radiated beams (11) 
which convey messages in a plurality of packets (36) to a plurality of subscribers 

identified by location information (I); said plurality of radiated beams (11) 
being directed toward the Earth's surface from a plurality of satellites (S) moving 

rapidly relative to the Earth's surface in a low Earth orbit comprising the steps 
of: 


generating said plurality of radiated beams (11) aboard said plurality of 
satellites (S); each of said plurality of satellites (S) having a plurality of 

antenna facets (58); 
emitting said plurality of radiated beams (11) from each of said plurality 
of antenna facets (58); 
illuminating a plurality of satellite footprints (10) on the surface of the 
Earth (E); 
mapping the surface of the Earth into a plurality of Earth-fixed supercells 
(12); each of said footprints (10) being associated with a plurality of 

Earth-fixed supercells (12); each of said plurality of Earth-fixed supercells 
containing a plurality of Earth-fixed cells (14), each of said plurality of 

Earth-fixed cells (14) being generally rectangular; and 
translating said location information (I) about said subscribers to channel, 
timing, and frequency assignments for each of said plurality of radiated 

beams (11) as they are used by said subscribers in one of said Earth-fixed 
cells (14).
