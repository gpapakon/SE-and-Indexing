<ABSTRACT>
In a cathode ray video display unit which is designed 
to display graphical and alphanumeric images, the marker 

is made up by two orthogonal caresian axes XAX, YAX 
which can be positioned by the operator or by the program. 

The axes have the same luminosity as the lines of the dis­
played image. The points of intersection P1-P5 of the axes 

of the marker with the portrayed lines are caused to stand 
out with increased brightness for the purpose of making 

their relative positon more evident on the video unit. The 
The coordinates of the points which stand out (X1, Y1, etc.) 

and those of the origin of the axes (X0, Y0) may be repro­
duced in the form of an alphanumeric message on part of 

the screen. The increased brightness is commanded by a 
signal formed as the AND function of the signal command­

ing the graphical display and a marker signal which is 
generated at a predetermined point in every line scan and 

throughout the whole of one selected line scan.
