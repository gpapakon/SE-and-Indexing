<ABSTRACT>
Implant allowing lacking of the orientation about 360  of a pre-angled stump for oral implantation of tooth, involving: a recessed implant to be fixed in the jaw (4) having a hollow upwardly portion providing at least one polygonal portion (p) and, a pre-angled stump (3) fixable to the implant in a determined rotational orientation, for supporting with the pre-angled stump (m) a tooth tilted with respect to the axis of the implant; a clamping screw (1) to clamp said stump (3) implant (4) in a rotational position, characterized by the fact that the: said stump (3) is connected to the said implant (4) axially by means of an intermediate coupling sleeve (2); said intermediate coupling sleeve (2) has: an external lower polygonal part for the insertion in the polygonal portion (p) of the said implant (4), and an upper external conical part with larger upper part, a through-hole for the said clamping screw (1), which abuts onto the superior surface of said larger base; in the said stump (3), there is a through-hole with conical hole in center (c) perpendicular to the support base of the stump, for the housing of the conical correspondent portion (c) of the said intermediate coupling sleeve (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
In the field of oral implantation after having carried out
the surgical phase for the insertion within the bone of the bi-phasic
implants, after the recovery period, the prosthetic phase
is carried out; to carry out this phase a stump that may be of
different forms and sizes is applied to the osteointegrated
implant.When the problem arises that we are unable to obtain a correct
and in line prosthesis with the anatomy of the mouth with a
straight stump, we must resort to pre-angled stumps that allow
different parallelism corrections. At present in trade there are
pre-angled stumps that do not have the possibility to be
oriented in any wanted position but, only in a few points that
do not always ensure the perfect alignment of the prosthesis
between stump and implant. This derives from the fact that the
stump is fitted between the implant with a polygonal coupling,
intending, for polygonal, any bevelling joint conformation,
independent of the number of sides or of their conformation,
including therefore toothing or grooving (E.g. See EP-A-0 323
421).The problem of this invention is to allow
the orientation of the stump in any position.The invention solves the problem by the implant 
system specified in claim 1.The new locking implant for pre-angled stump, according to this
invention, allows to orient the stump in any position. As claimed
this implant is made up of four components:
1) locking screw; 2) sleeve with polygonal underside and conical cylindrical
upperside having a maximum diameter in the upper part;3) pre-angled stump, with axially conical hole perpendicular to
the support base of the stump, for housing the conical sleeve;4) implant, having the internal upper part composed from a
polygonal seat for the precise coupling of the underside of the
sleeve and a thread for the screwing of the locking screw.The locking screw is inserted in the conical polygonal sleeve and
these two components are inserted in the conical hole of the pre-angled
stump in order that the polygonal part of the sleeve
comes out of the base support of the stump. The complete stump,
formed in this way, is coupled to the implant by inserting the
protrusive polygonal part of the sleeve in the polygonal part of
the implant and simultaneously tightening the locking screw on
the internal thread of the implant until the support bases of the
implant and of the stump are almost in contact with each other,
therefore allowing the free rotation of the stump . Once the
optimal orientation of the pre-angled stump is established, the
locking

1. Implant system for oral implantation of an artificial tooth,
comprising :


a recessed implant (4), destined to be fixed in the bone of the jaw,
a pre-angled body stump (3) fixable to the implant (4) in a
certain position of rotational orientation, to support in the

respective stump (3-m) a tilted tooth in respect to the axis of the
implant (4),
a clamping screw (1) of said stump (3) in the said implant (4) in
a certain rotational position,

characterized by the fact that :

said implant (4) has a blind hole with an upper polygonal portion
(p');
said stump (3) is axially connected to the said implant (4) by
means of an intermediate coupling sleeve (2);
said intermediate coupling sleeve (2) has:

an external lower polygonal part (p) for the insertion in
said polygonal portion (p') of said implant (4),
and an upper external conical part (c) with a larger
upper base (o),
a through-hole for a clamping screw (1), which abuts
onto the superior surface of said larger base (o);
in said stump (3), there is a through-hole with a co-axial conical
hole perpendicular to the support base surface of the stump,

for housing in conical rotational-coupling action said
correspondent conical portion (c) of said intermediate coupling

sleeve (2).
