An actuator unit (10) for motor vehicle brakes,
 
comprising 


a brake pressure booster (12) which comprises front and 
rear housing parts (20, 24) and includes at least one movable 

partition (32, 34) at which differential pressure can be 
generated, 
a master cylinder (14) which includes a flange (70) 
fastened to the front housing part (20) and having at least 

one through hole (68), and 
at least one bolt (50) which comprises a shaft (54) extending 
through the hole (68) in the flange (70) and through 

the two housing parts (20, 24) as well as the movable partition 
(32, 34) of the booster (12), a head (52) disposed in 

front of the front housing part (20), and a threaded portion 
(56) projecting out of the rear housing part (24) and adapted 

to be screwed into a stationary thread presented in a dividing 
wall (16) of a motor vehicle, 
characterized
 in that 
a hollow, inner threaded member (26) having a front face 
(58) is fastened to the front housing part (20),
 
the shaft (54) of the bolt (50) passes through the inner 
threaded member (26) and the head (52) of the bolt rests on 

the front face (58) thereof, 
the flange (70) is clamped between the inner threaded 
member (26) and a hollow, outer threaded member (60) whose inner 

diameter is greater than the outer diameter of the head 
(52) of the bolt (50), and 
the outer threaded member (60) includes a sleeve-like extension 
(62) which engages in the hole (68) formed in the 

flange (70) and is screw connected to the inner threaded 
member (26). 
The actuator unit as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the head (52) of the bolt (50) is disposed at least 

partly within the outer threaded member (26).  
 
The actuator unit as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the head (52) of the bolt (50) is clamped between the inner 

threaded member (26) and a cover (72) which is screw 
connected to the outer threaded member (60). 
The actuator unit as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the bolt (50) includes a rear stop (74) by which it rests 

on the rear housing part (24). 
The actuator unit as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the rear stop (74) is screwed like a nut on the rear portion 

(56) of the bolt (50) and is disposed inside the booster 
(12) and locked against rotation. 
The actuator unit as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the bolt (50) is connected to a retention 

element (78) which is arrranged inside the booster (12) 
and prevents the bolt from falling out to the front prior to 

being threaded into the dividing wall (16) of the motor vehicle. 
The actuator unit as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the bolt (50) extends through a tube 

(30) disposed within the booster (12) and maintaining a predetermined 
distance between the front and rear housing parts 

(20, 24). 
The actuator as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that 
the tube (30) is screw connected to a rear threaded member 

(28) which is fastened to the rear housing part (24).
