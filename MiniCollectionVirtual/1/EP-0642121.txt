<ABSTRACT>
A recordable optical disc (20) on which information 
is recorded by applying a light beam on the surface thereof, 

includes: a first recording area on which information is 
recorded and reproduced while the disc is rotated at a first 

linear velocity; and a second recording area on which 
information is recorded and reproduced while the disc is 

rotated at a second linear velocity. The first recording area 
and the second recording area include guide grooves having 

wobble frequency lower than frequency band of EFM signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recordable 
optical disc, and more particularly to a recordable optical 
disc suitable for recording signal according to CDV (Compact 
Disc Video) format. Conventionally, there is CD (Compact Disc), known as 
a media for reproduction only, on which music information is 
recorded. There has recently been developed a recordable 
compact disc (CD-R:Recordable Compact Disc). Recording format 
of CD-R is generally referred to as "Orange Book", and it is in 
conformity with recording format of CD. FIGS. 1A and 1B 
illustrate physical format of CD-R. In CD-R, a lead-in area 4, 
a program area 5 and a lead-out area 6 are formed from inner 
circumference of the disc to outer circumference thereof, like 
the format of CD. In addition, in CD-R, a PCA (Power 
Calibration Area) 2 and a PMA (Power Memory Area) 3 are 
provided radially inwardly of the lead-in area 4, as 
illustrated. Recording track on the R-CD is provided with guide 
groove that is wobbled by the frequency of a carrier of 22.05 
kHz which is frequency-modulated by data indicating absolute 
time information (ATIP: Absolute Time In Pregroove). A laser  
 
beam for recording desired information is moved to follow the 
guide grooves under tracking servo control, and rotational 
speed of spindle motor which rotates the R-CD is controlled so 
that the wobbling guide groove pattern has a central frequency 
of 22.05 kHz. In this manner, tracking servo and spindle-motor 
servo controls can be effected on unrecorded R-CDs as well as 
recorded R-CDs. The PCA 2 is an area where test recording is carried 
out prior to an actual information recording process, so that 
the power of the recording laser beam will be optimized for 
recording desired information in the information recording 
process. The PCA 2 is composed of a count area and a test area. 
The count area has a plurality of subareas corresponding respectively 
to a plurality of subareas of the test area, and 
each containing a suitable EFM signal recorded therein. Test 
recording for measuring an optimum recording laser beam power 
is carried out in the subareas of the test area. One of the 
subareas of the test area is consumed by a single test 
recording. Any subarea of the test area which has once been used 
by test recording is not available for a next test recording. 
It is therefore necessary to search for an unused subarea 
positioned radially inwardly of the used subarea for use in the 
next test recording. The count area is provided to facilitate 
the searching
