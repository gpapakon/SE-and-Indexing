<ABSTRACT>
A connector is provided whose plastic housing includes downwardly-depending pegs for insertion in a circuit board to hold the connector in place, which provides for secure holding of the pegs in the circuit board holes by merely pressing the connector down into place. A spring clip (32, Fig. 2) is mounted on each peg, each clip having outwardly-bowed arms (36, 38) whose middle can press against the walls of the circuit board hole (14) to securely hold the peg in the hole, and whose lower ends are supported by the peg.

<DESCRIPTION>
One type of connector which mounts near the edge 
of a circuit board, includes a housing molded of a polymer. 
The housing includes a main portion which rests on the upper 
surface of the circuit board and several depending pegs that 
extend through round holes in the circuit board. After the 
pegs are inserted through the holes, downwardly protruding 
portions of the pegs are heat staked to melt the ends of the 
plastic legs so portions thereof extend against the bottom 
surface of the circuit board and thereby lock the connector 
to the board. Companies which purchase the connectors to 
mount on circuit boards, often wish to avoid the secondary 
operation of heat staking. Heat staking adds cost to the 
assembly and is often perceived as unreliable and as being 
inconsistent or difficult to monitor in a manufacturing 
environment. If the pegs could be constructed by the 
connector manufacturer, so the pegs automatically securely 
lock to the board upon merely pressing the connector down 
against the board, the assembly cost for the customer could 
be significantly reduced. US-A-5,108,308 shows a 
clip which locks the peg in the hole. However, his clips 
are not reliably secured to the pegs prior to hole 
insertion, and his clip locks to the lower corner of the 
hole and does not permit removal of the connector. In accordance with the present 
invention, a board-mounted connector assembly of low cost is 
provided according to claim 1, which enables the connector to be mounted on the 
board by merely pressing the connector into place according to claim 5. 
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the connector includes a polymer-molded housing with a main part 
that lies above the board and with integrally molded pegs 
which each projects down into a board hole. A plurality of 
metal clips are provided, each mounted on one of the pegs 
and having resilient arms that press outwardly against the 
walls of the hole. The connector manufacturer installs the 
clips on the pegs, and the customer can mount the connector  
 
on a board by merely drilling round holes in a board and 
pressing down the connector so the pegs with the clips 
thereon move down into the board holes and automatically 
held in place. Each clip can be constructed with a band that 
mounts about a portion of the peg, a plurality of arms 
extending largely downwardly but with a bowed portion for 
bearing against the walls of the hole, and an upper portion 
which locks into place on the peg. The arms have free lower 
ends
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A board-mounted connector assembly which includes a circuit board (12) having 
upper and lower surface (100, 101) and a plurality of peg-receiving holes (14), and 

a connector (16) which has a housing (26) molded of a polymer which includes a 
main part that lies above said board and which includes a plurality of integrally 

molded pegs (34) which each projects downwardly into one of said board holes, 

characterized by
: 

a plurality of spring clips (32), each mounted on one of said pegs (34) so as to 
prevent substantial vertical movement of the clip (32) on the peg (34) and each 

having at least one resilient arm (36), all said arms (36) of said clips (32) pressing 
resiliently outwardly against only locations of walls of said holes (14) which lie 

above and are spaced from said lower (101) surface of said circuit board (12). 
The assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein: 

each of said clips (32) has an axis (42) and includes an upper portion (70) mounted 
on said peg (34), and each of said clips (32) includes at least one arm (36) having an 

upper end (60) extending largely downwardly from said clip upper portion (70), a 
free lower end (62) slidably supported against said peg, and an outwardly bent 

middle (64) that is resiliently deflected towards said axis (42) by the walls of said 
board hole (14) and which resiliently presses substantially radially outwardly away 

from said axis and against said hole walls. 
The assembly as claimed in at least one of claims 1 or 2, wherein: 

each of said pegs (34) forms at least two upwardly facing shoulders (48); 
each of said clips (32) has an axis (42) and is formed of sheet metal and has a band (52) 

and at least two 180Â° bent legs (72, 74) each forming a leg part lying radially within 
said band and having free end (76) substantially abutting one of said shoulders. 
The assembly as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 3, wherein: 

said connector housing main part has a lower wall (96) with a bottom surface (39) which 
rests on a face of said circuit board, and said lower wall has a recess (92) around the 

top of said peg (34), with a portion of said clip (32) lying in said recess. 
A method for mounting a connector (16) on a circuit board (12) by drilling a plurality 
of round holes (14) in said board, molding said connector of polymer material 

with a main bottom wall to lie against a surface of said board, and with a plurality 
of pegs (34) depending from said bottom wall to extend into said holes (14), 

and 

forming a sheet of metal into a plurality of clips (32) that each have an axis (42) and a plurality of resiliently bendable arms (36, 38) for entering into 
one of said holes (14) and pressing against the walls of said hole, characterized by: mounting each clip on one of said pegs (34) at the final position of the clip on the 

peg so as to prevent substantial vertical movement of the clip on the peg; 
after said step of mounting, lowering said connector (16) until said pegs (34) and 
clips (32) lie in line with said board holes and substantially against said board (12), 

and pressing down said connector to force said clips into said holes to a final full 
insertion position such that all of said arms (36, 38) press resiliently against only 

locations on the walls of said holes (14) which lie above the lower surface of said 
circuit board (12). 
The method claimed in claim 5, wherein: 

said step of molding includes forming each of said pegs with a plurality of upward-facing 
shoulder portions (48); 
said step of forming said clip includes forming each of said clips with a vertically 
extending axis (42) and with an upper portion that includes a band (52) for surrounding  

 
said peg and a plurality of locking legs (72, 74) initially extending upwardly from said 

band, and bending over each leg so an end portion (86) of the leg furthest from said 
band extends downwardly and lies radially inwardly of the leg end portion closest 

to said band (52) and so the tip (76) of the leg faces downwardly; 
said step of mounting includes pushing each clip upwardly onto a peg until said tips (76) 
of said legs each snaps into a position above one of said peg shoulder portions (48). 
The method claimed in claim 5 or 6, wherein: 

said step of molding includes forming said lower wall (96) of the connector, which 
rests on a face of said circuit board, with a recess (92) around the top of said peg
