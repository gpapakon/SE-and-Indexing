<ABSTRACT>
A nut or bolt with fine adjustment comprises a primary 
screw thread (100, 200) formed in the nut or on the bolt, and 

an axial extent on which is formed an external secondary screw 
thread (101, 201) the pitch of which is less than that of the 

primary screw thread (100, 200). A correspondingly internally 
threaded auxiliary nut (103, 203) is screwed onto the axial 

extent to provide an effective packing and/or micro-adjustment 
feature to the combination, the location of the secondary 

screw thread being such that it does not interfere with normal 
rotation of the nut or bolt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nut or bolt with fine 
adjustment. Conventional nuts and bolts are well-established for 
interconnecting components either with or without packing 
between the nut and/or bolt and the components being 
interconnected. The adjustment available from such nuts and 
bolts is determined by the pitch of the screw-thread on the 
nut and bolt. In certain circumstances, particularly with 
course-threaded nuts and bolts, it is not possible to achieve 
accurate adjustment therewith. It would be desirable to be able to provide a nut or bolt 
having a conventional associated thread but which was such as 
to enable fine or micro-adjustment to be achieved thereby. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
nut or bolt comprising a primary screw thread formed therein 
or thereon respectively, characterised in that said nut or 
bolt further comprises an axial extent on which is formed an 
external secondary screw thread the pitch of which is less 
than that of the primary screw thread, and a corresponding 
internally threaded auxiliary nut adapted to be received on 
said axial extent. The provision of the smaller pitched screw thread on the 
associated axial extent is such that it in no way interferes 
with the portion of the nut or bolt by which rotation thereof 
is achieved, the smaller pitch of the secondary thread being  
 
such as to enable the auxiliary nut to provide an effective 
packing or micro-adjustment feature. In one embodiment of the invention, a bolt includes a 
cylindrical shaft on which said primary screw thread is 
formed, and, at or adjacent the upper end of said shaft, an 
increased diameter axial extent on which said secondary screw 
thread is formed. The bolt may include a head portion extending axially 
beyond said increased diameter extent and by which said bolt 
is rotated. The diameter of said head portion may be greater 
than, smaller than, or the same as that of said increased 
diameter axial extent. Alternatively the upper surface of said increased 
diameter axial extent may be configured to enable rotation of 
the bolt, for example by including a polygonal recess therein 
to receive an associated wrench, or by having a groove formed 
therein to receive the blade of an associated screwdriver. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a nut 
comprises a body member through which extends a cylindrical 
bore having the primary screw thread formed therein, the body 
member including a first portion of polygonal external 
configuration by which the

A nut or bolt comprising a primary screw thread 
(100, 200) formed thereon or therein respectively, 

characterised in that said nut or bolt further comprises an 
axial extent on which is formed an external secondary screw 

thread (101, 201) the pitch of which is less than that of the 
primary screw thread (100, 200), and a correspondingly 

internally threaded auxiliary nut (103, 203) adapted to be 
received on said axial extent. 
A bolt as claimed in Claim 1 and including a 
cylindrical shaft on which said primary screw thread (100) is 

formed, and, at or adjacent the upper end of said shaft, an 
increased diameter axial extent on which said secondary screw 

thread (101) is formed. 
A bolt as claimed in Claim 2 and including a head 
portion (102) by which the bolt is rotated. 
A bolt as claimed in Claim 2 in which the upper 
surface of the increased diameter axial extent is configured 

to enable rotation of the bolt. 
A bolt as claimed in Claim 4 in which the upper 
surface of the increased diameter axial extent includes a 

polygonal recess (302) therein to receive an associated 
wrench. 
A bolt as claimed in Claim 4 in which the upper 
surface of the increased diameter portion has a linear gro
ove, 
a cross groove or a star groove for receiving therein the 

 
correspondingly shaped blade of an associated screwdriver. 
A nut as claimed in Claim 1 and comprising a body 
member through which extends a cylindrical bore having the 

primary screw thread (200) formed thereon, the body member 
including a first portion of polygonal external configuration 

by which the nut can be rotated, and a second portion, forming 
an axial extension of the first portion, on which said 

external secondary screw thread (201) is formed and onto which 
the auxiliary nut (203) is threaded.
