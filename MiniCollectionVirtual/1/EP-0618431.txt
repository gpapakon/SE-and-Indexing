<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a clinical thermometer for measuring 
the temperature of a living body in a noncontacting 

manner by receiving infrared radiation from an eardrum 
or a body surface. An infrared sensor senses infrared 

radiation incident through an opening portion for 
narrowing the angle of field of the infrared sensor. An 

electrical signal from the infrared sensor is converted 
into the value of the temperature of an object to be 

measured. A maximum value TP
ob
 of the converted 
temperature values is detected. In this manner, the 

maximum value TP
ob
 detected when a predetermined time 
has elapsed from the start of the measurement is 

determined as the temperature of the object to be 
measured. The predetermined time at which the 

measurement is ended is extended in accordance with the 

time elapsed when the maximum value TP
ob
 is detected, 
thereby determining the temperature of the object to be 

measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a noncontacting
clinical thermometer for measuring the temperature of
an eardrum or a body surface as an object of
temperature measurement.Conventionally, contacting clinical thermometers
for measuring the skin temperature of a living body
have been extensively used for general purposes. The
temperature of a body surface to be measured by such a
clinical thermometer is strongly influenced by an
environmental temperature. Therefore, the body surface
temperature is different in nature from a so-called
body temperature which is used in fields of medical
treatments and medical science for the purposes of
screening for the presence/absence and the condition of
a disease, and for the basal body temperatures of
women. For this reason, it is inadequate to measure
and use the skin temperature as a body temperature for
these purposes.Consequently, thermometry for an eardrum has begun
to be performed by using a noncontacting temperature
sensor. The clinical meaning of an eardrum temperature 
will be mentioned. A body temperature means a core
temperature at which homeostasis is held in a living
body, and a hypothalamus is considered to be the center
for regulating this core temperature. From an
anatomical viewpoint, an internal carotid artery
perfused in the hypothalamus as the thermoregulatory
center runs near an eardrum, which means that the
eardrum and the hypothalamus share blood. It is
therefore assumed that the correlation between the
eardrum and the hypothalamus with respect to a
temperature change is extremely high.For this reason, the eardrum temperature has long
attracted attention as a site reflecting the
temperature of the hypothalamus as the thermoregulatory
center of a living body. However, any conventional
contacting clinical thermometer cannot measure the
eardrum temperature, since thermometry using a
contacting sensor may give damages to an eardrum. A
radiation clinical thermometer using an infrared sensor
has been proposed to eliminate this danger of eardrum
damages and to make body temperature measurement within
a short time period possible.As shown in Fig. 13, however, a conventional
noncontacting eardrum clinical thermometer making use
of radiation has a wide angle of field (V1) of an
infrared sensor and an optical system associated with 
the sensor. Therefore, this clinical thermometer
captures not only an eardrum V2 but also an external
auditory meatus within the field of view of the
infrared sensor. Note that the wide angle of field of
the optical system
