<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carbon fiber reinforced
resin coil spring and method for manufacturing the same,
and more specifically to a coil spring consisting of a
spirally wound cord made of carbon fiber reinforced resin
and its manufacturing method.U.S. Patent No.2852424 proposes a fiber reinforced
resin coil spring which is more lightweight than a
conventional metal coil spring. The coil spring is made
of resin impregnated glass roving which is wound on a
mandrel for forming a coiled structure. In this resin
coil spring, the orientation of the reinforced fibers is
uniform and is parallel to the axis of the cord.Japanese Patent Laid Open No.56-18136 discloses a
coil spring in which the orientation of the fibers is
chosen relative to the axis of the cord. Namely, all the
reinforcing fibers are oriented with respect to the
direction in which the fibers are subject to a tensile
force when a load is applied to the coil spring. The
orientation angle is within the range of 30 ° ∼60°
relative to the axis of the cord. An equivalent technical
disclosure is made in GB-A-2056615. Japanese Patent Laid Open No.57-11742 discloses a
coil spring in which the reinforcing fibers are inclined
at a predetermined oblique angle with respect to the axis
of the cord. Further, the reinforcing fibers are wound in
the two different directions so that the two groups of
fibers cross over each other, the cross-over angle at the
center in the longitudinal direction being different from
the angles at both ends. Such an arrangement of
reinforced fibers allows regulation of torsional rigidity
and gives the coil spring a non-linear spring constant.Generally, carbon fiber is a material having
excellent mechanical properties; hence carbon fiber
reinforced resins have excellent features. However, the
carbon fiber reinforced resin also has the disadvantage
of relatively low compressive strength compared with
tensile strength.When weight or force is applied to the coil spring
having oblique reinforcing fibers with respect to the axis
of the cord which are wound in two different directions
and which cross each other, the cord receives a torsional
stress. This torsional stress causes a compressive force
to act on the first group of oriented fibers and a tensile
force to act on the second group of oriented fibers. Due
to this characteristic of the carbon fiber reinforced
resin composites, the fracture of the coil spring begins
in the layer in which the reinforcing fibers are oriented
in the direction of compression. In the above-mentioned
coil
