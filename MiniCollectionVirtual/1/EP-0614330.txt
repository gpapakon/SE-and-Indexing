<ABSTRACT>
In a cooler including a fan unit (3) attached to the top of, or buried into, a heat sink (2) fitted to a heat generation device 
(1), the present invention constitutes the heat sink (2) in various shapes so as to generate an effective air flow and to accomplish a 

uniform cooling operation. A cooling fan disposed away from the heat sink (2) or sideways of the heat sink (2) effectively cools 
the device through a ventilation path defined by a pipe or a cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cooling device
for cooling a heat-generating element or a heat-generating
unit, that is, a heat sink system, more
particularly relates to a heat-generating element cooling
device for cooling a heat-generating element or heat-generating
unit such as a high density integrated circuit
package.Relative small sized, but multi-functional and high
performance electronic equipment such as personal
computers (PCs), work stations, and other desktop type or
desk-side type computers make use of high density
integrated circuit packages. These become local sources
of heat. Usually, heat-radiating fins are provided
individually or in common for such high density
integrated circuit packages. Use is made of natural
cooling by natural ventilation or forced cooling by
common cooling fins for the equipment as a whole so as to
cool the same along with other elements and units.Some recent high integration LSI packages give off
several watts of heat. Further, along with the rise of
the clock frequency used, the amount of heat generated
increases. In particular, it is sometimes not possible to
obtain sufficient cooling with the above type of usual
heat sink in the case of an LSI package generating from 5
to 6 or more watts of heat. As the cooling fans for
forced cooling, use is made of, for example, 60 to 80 mm
square sized fans for the above-mentioned desktop type
personal computers or 120 mm square sized fans for desk-side
type computers, operated at a considerably high
speed of, for example, 3000 to 5000 rpm. Use of ones with
more powerful cooling capacities is not possible in view
of the size of the equipment, costs, and noise. That is, if the fans are made larger in size, the
size of the equipment increases accompanying this, the
costs increase, and the noise increases as well, but the
cooling capacity does not increase commensurate with the
same. Further, even if a number of fans are used arranged
in series or in parallel, the size of the equipment and
the costs increase in accordance with this, but the
resultant amount of cooling air does not similarly
multiply. Further, operating the fan at a higher speed is
difficult in view of the noise. Also, even if a large
sized fan is operated at a low speed, the merits in terms
of cooling effect and noise commensurate with the
demerits of the equipment size and costs cannot be
obtained. For these reasons, as a result, it is not
possible to supply sufficient cooling air for the heat
sink of a high heat generating LSI package for example as
