that an aliphatic, straight-chain, saturated or

unsaturated aldehyde having from 2 to 12 C atoms is
employed.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that an aliphatic, straight-chain, saturated or

unsaturated methyl ketone having from 2 to 12 C atoms
is employed.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that from 2 to 3 mol of hydrocyanic acid are employed

per mol of aldehyde or ketone.
