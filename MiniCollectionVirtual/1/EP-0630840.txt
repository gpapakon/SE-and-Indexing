<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a handling device comprising a track (1) constituting a rolling path for one or more moving objects, the said moving objects being entrained by a linear electric motor composed of an inductor (42, 43) carried by the moving object and extending parallel to the track and an armature (4, 5) carried by the track and extending along the latter so as to be able to interact with the inductor. According to the invention, as may be observed in transverse section, the said inductor (42, 43) has a rectangular shape defining three active faces and one inactive face and the said armature (4, 5) has a U-shape defining three active faces and adapted to accommodate the inductor so that the respective active faces of the inductor and of the armature interact together in pairs.

Handling device including a track (1) extending over 
a determined route and constituting a travel path for one or 

more mobile elements (30) disposed along it, the said track 
comprising guide means (58) for the mobile elements, the said 

mobile elements each comprising travelling means (53) for 
cooperating with the said travel path and drive means (40) 

for ensuring their individual movement along the track, the 
drive means including a linear electric motor composed of an 

inductor (42, 43) borne by the mobile element and extending 
parallel to the track, including a plurality of magnetic (45) 

poles distributed along the inductor and between which are 
placed a plurality of coils of conducting wire (48), and of 

an armature (4, 5) borne by the track and extending along it 
so as to be able to cooperate with the inductor, a spark gap 

of predetermined width being interposed therebetween,
 
characterized in that
 
   the said inductor (42, 43) and the said armature (4, 5) 

have, as viewed in cross section: 

the former, a rectangular shape defining three active 
faces and one inactive face, and 
the second, a U shape defining three active faces and 
adapted to house the inductor in such a way that the 

respective active faces of the inductor and of the armature 
cooperate with one another, two by two; 
 
   the said travel path of the track being constituted by 

one of the said active faces (8) of the armature, the 
travelling means (53) of each mobile element bearing upon the 

said face. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein the drive means 
for each mobile element include two linear electric motors 

identical with the aforementioned motor, comprising: 

two respective inductors (42, 43) carried by the 
mobile element, juxtaposed so as to extend parallel to one 

another, their respective inactive faces being located  
 

opposite one another; and 
two respective armatures (4, 5) carried by the track, 
juxtaposed so as to extend parallel to one another and facing 

one another. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the said guide means include a longitudinal free edge 

(58) defined by the said U shape of the armature (4, 5). 
Device according to claim 2, wherein the two 
armatures (4, 5) of the track extend in a general 

substantially horizontal plane, the said travel path of the 
track being constituted by two respective active faces (8) of 

the two armatures extending horizontally at a lowest level. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein each armature includes: 


- a channel (4, 5) extending along the track and having 
the said U shape, made of a material that is a good conductor 

of electricity; and 
- three longitudinal plates (12 to 14) having dimensions 
corresponding substantially to those of the three active 

faces of the said armature and disposed respectively against 
three external faces of the said channel, opposite the said 

three active faces, these plates being made of a 
ferromagnetic material.
