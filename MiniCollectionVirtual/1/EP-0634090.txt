<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to rotary hover mowers which 
are required to collect grass cuttings to leave a neat 

and tidy finish to a mown area. 
In more detail, the mower comprises a main body (1), a 
power source (6) supported on the main body (1), an impeller (8) for 

creating pressure air and a cutting member (10) each drivingly 
connected to the power source (6), at least two hoods (14,15) directly 

or indirectable attachable to the main body (1) and each 
opening downwardly towards ground datum, ducting for 

connecting each hood (14,15) with a passage (13,13A) for transmitting 
pressure air from the impeller (8) to each hood (14,15) whereby 

pressure air issuing from each hood (14,15) serves to at least 
support the mower above ground datum.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary hover mower, and in particular to such a mower
that is required to collect grass cuttings to leave a neat and tidy finish to a mown area.The type of hover mower which can presently collect grass has some disadvantages
which restrict overall performance of the product. In particular, known collecting hover
mowers, by virtue of their collection system, can only collect grass properly when the
product is used in a straight forward direction. This is a major disadvantage, since a hover
mower offers the unique facility to be used in all directions. A further disadvantage with
known grass collecting hover mowers is that, in order to alter the height of cut of the
mower, its blade needs to be removed, and blade spacing washers added or taken away
from between the blade and an abutment to alter the position of the blade relative to the
ground. Another limitation is that, since the machine collects grass in a collection device,
which is usually attached to the rear of the machine, it becomes unbalanced, which can
cause the front of the machine to lift slightly, allowing air and grass cuttings to be
exhausted from within a cutting chamber, causing a nuisance to the user, and a reduction
in performance. A known type of mower is described in EP-A-0045177.An aim of the invention is to reduce some or all of these product deficiencies, and
to offer advantages over products utilising existing technology.The present invention provides a rotary hover mower comprising a main body, a
power source supported on the main body, an impeller for creating pressure air, and a
cutting member, the impeller and the cutting member each being drivingly connected to the
power source, characterised in that at least two hoods are directly or indirectly carried by
the main body, each hood opening downwardly towards ground datum, and in that
passageway means are provided for transmitting pressure air from the impeller to each
hood, whereby pressure air issuing from each hood serves to support the mower above
ground datum.Conveniently, the mower further comprising a secondary body disposed within the
main body, the passageway means being formed between the main body and the secondary
body. Preferably, the secondary body includes an annular peripheral wall defining a
cutting chamber in which the cutting member is rotatably mounted. The impeller and the 
cutting member are preferably coaxially mounted, and the impeller extends substantially
across the annular peripheral wall for preferentially directing

<CLAIMS>
A rotary hover mower comprising a main body (1), a power source (6) supported
on the main body, an impeller (8) for creating pressure air, and a cutting member (10), the

impeller and the cutting member each being drivingly connected to the power source,
characterised in that at least two hoods (14 and 15) are directly or indirectly carried by the

main body, each hood opening downwardly towards ground datum, and in that
passageway means (13, 13A) are provided for transmitting pressure air from the impeller

to each hood, whereby pressure air issuing from each hood serves to support the mower
above ground datum.
A mower according to claim 1, further comprising a secondary body (12) disposed

within the main body (1), the passageway means (13, 13A) being formed between the
main body and the secondary body.
A mower according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the secondary body (12)
includes an annular peripheral wall (12C) defining a cutting chamber in which the cutting

member (10) is rotatably mounted.
A mower according to claim 3, wherein the impeller (8) extends substantially
across the annular peripheral wall (12C) for directing pressure air directly into the

passageway means (13, 13A).
A mower according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the impeller (8) and the
cutting member (10) are coaxially mounted.
A mower according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein one hood (14 or 15) is
disposed forwardly, and the other (15 or 14) rearwardly, of the main body (1) when

considered in the normal direction of use. 
A mower according to any one of claims 1 to 6, further comprising means for
adjusting the position of each hood (14, 15) relative to the main body (1).
