<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for 
decompressing compressed video data as for recording or 
transmission. Over the past two decades significant effort has 
been committed to the compression of digitized video signals 
for purposes of image storage and transmission. As a result 
many types of compression techniques have evolved 
including the use of discrete cosine transforms, sub-band 
encoding, pyramid transforms, intraframe encoding, 
interframe encoding and combinations of the above to name a 
few. 
Document EP-A-0 396 285 for example discloses a combination 
of inter- and intraframe encoding techniques. 
More recently the International Organization for 
Standardization has developed a video compression standard 
for use in video storage applications, e.g., CD-ROM. This 
proposed standard is described in the document "Coding of 
Moving Pictures and Associated Audio", ISO-IEC 
JTC1/SC2/WG11, MPEG 90/176 Rev.2; December 18, 1990. 
Hereinbelow this system will be referred to as MPEG. A feature of the MPEG standard is the use of both 
intraframe and interframe coding techniques in combination 
with discrete cosine transforms, run length encoding and 
statistical (Huffman) encoding. Intraframe encoding in 
general terms involves the encoding of an image frame from a 
single source frame to provide sufficient encoded data for 
reconstruction of an image from only the intraframe encoded 
data. Interframe encoding is the generation of encoded frame 
data from, for example, the differences between information 
from a current source frame and a frame predicted from prior 
frames. As such images may not be reconstructed from a 
frame of interframe encoded data without information from 
prior frames. The MPEG system incorporates two types of 
interframe encoding. The first develops predictive frames 
(designated P frames) from the current frame and a single 
prior frame. The second develops bidirectionally predictive 
frames (designated B frames) from the current frame and one  
 
or both of a prior and a subsequent frame. For example, 
assume that frames occur in a sequence F1, F2, F3, F4... and 
that frame F1 is to be intraframe encoded (designated I 
frame), frames F2 and F3 are to be B frame encoded and 
frame F4 is to be P frame encoded. The P encoded frame is 
developed from differences between frame F4 and a 
predicted frame generated from a decoded version of I frame 
F1 only. The B encoded frame representing frame F2 (F3) is 
developed from differences between frame F2 (F3) and 
predicted frames
