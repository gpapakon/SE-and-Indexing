<ABSTRACT>
Machine for automatically positioning and aligning 
containers, such as plastic bottles, including a hopper 

(26) for receiving randomly containers (4) to be sorted, a 
hopper bottom (27) with a peripheral edge portion spaced at 

a distance from the side wall of the hopper to provide a 
space thorough which the containers can drop by gravity 

towards a lower section, a rotatable container holder 
support means below the hopper bottom and container 

holders (3) supported on said structure for movement 
therewith and having recesses (1a,2a) therein for receiving and 

holding containers in a lying position. The container 
holder support means comprises at least two rows of 

openings (1a, 2a) surrounding said peripheral portion of 
said bottom (27) and covering means (25) separate said rows 

of openings in several non adjacent areas, staggered along 
said peripheral portion of said bottom. Below said rows of 

openings (1a, 2a) are a plurality of independently 
removable discharge chutes converging over a single 

annular plane which re-groups, in a single row (50), the 
whole of said containers (4) uprightly positioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machine intended for 
automatically positioning and continuously feeding 
containers, for example bottles or other hollow articles 
made from synthetic material, which may be of very 
different sizes and shapes. Taking into account that the 
speed of filling machines has increased with the passage of 
time it is therefore necessary to provide a positioning 
machine which has a sufficiently high rate of delivery of 
plastic bottles which are properly oriented and aligned to 
allow a high production filling machines or similar 
equipment to operate at its optimum capacity. Known machines of the type to which the present 
invention relates include in general: 
a) a hopper of any shape or dimension provided with an 
opening to receive in bulk containers that fall onto a 
bottom plane whose edges are at a distance from the side 
wall of the hopper providing a peripheral space allowing 
the passage of the containers; b) a structure provided with displacement means in enclosed 
circuit, located below the bottom plane, including, fully 
or in part: 
a plurality of detachable container holding elements 
removably mounted at the periphery of the structure 
defining a series of recesses adapted to receive containers 
in a lying position and provided with retaining means for 
one part of the containers, namely their neck, in such a 
way as to release them in a predetermined position, usually 
with the neck upward; a plurality of discharge chutes provided under the 
recesses for receiving and transferring the containers, 
correctly oriented an aligning them on a fixed bottom 
towards an exit conveyor that feed, for example, a bottling 
line; c) a plane or shelf, which may be adjustable in height, 
located below the recesses and over the chutes, designed to 
support the containers when they are conveyed by the 
holding elements defining the recesses for receiving and 
retaining them in a lying position, the plane or shelf  
 
being provided with an opening in an unloading area through 
which the containers fall when moved into position 
thereover by the container holding elements. Machines known to the applicant are the following 
grouped by the function they perform: 
a) Aidlin machine (U.S. Patent NÂº 3, 295, 659) which 
discloses the basic technical feature which facilitates 
carrying out the upright positioning of the containers, the 
machine comprising a hopper into which the containers or 
bottles which are to be sorted are randomly loaded, having 
an inclined axis, an inclined disc

container holder means for supporting containers (4) 

in a lying position in said recesses during movement 
of said container holder means; 
a discharge section in said support shelf means for 
discontinuing support of containers (4) at a 

predetermined location so that containers in said 
container holder means (3) pass through said discharge 

openings at said discharge section; 
tilting means (42) on said container holder means (3) 
engaging a part of each container (4) for tilting each 

container into a predetermined position as each 
container passes through said discharge openings at  

 
said discharge section; 
chute means mounted below and movable with said 
container holder means (3) for receiving, orientating 

and guiding containers (4) passing through said 
discharge openings into a predetermined position, 

moving said containers (4) along a fixed bottom (11) 
from which they are evacuated by an exit conveyor 

(50), 
characterized
