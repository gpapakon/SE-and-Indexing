<ABSTRACT>
A process monitors at least one hydraulic characteristic in a raw or waste water stream 
and/or system of said raw or waste water treatment process. At least one fluorescent specie(s) 

that has a maximum excitation wavelength of less than about 400 nm is added to a raw or waste 
water stream and/or system of said raw or waste water treatment process and at least one sample 

of water from said raw or waste water stream and/or system of said raw or waste water treatment 
process is analyzed for at least the presence of the fluorescent specie(s), and the presence of the 

specie of fluorescent specie(s) in such sample determines at least one hydraulic characteristic of 
the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field of industrial raw and waste water treatment 
processes (clarification and/or waste reduction processes) and more particularly in the technical 
field of monitoring the hydraulic characteristics of such raw and waste water treatment processes 
so as to increase the efficiency thereof. The hydraulic characteristics of industrial raw and waste water treatment processes have 
been monitored by adding to the water systems and/or water streams thereof chemicals such as 
lithium and visible dyes, and then monitoring such signature chemicals. The monitoring 
requires analysis of samples taken from the water stream and/or system to determine at least the 
presence, and often the concentration, of the signature chemical. Lithium analysis cannot 
normally be done outside of laboratory facilities and requires several days for completion. The 
delay due to the sample-transport and analysis time diminishes the value of lithium monitoring 
for raw and waste water treatment processes. The feedback information is inevitably days 
behind the sampling, and the hydraulic characteristics routinely have changed during the  
 
interval. This disadvantageous time delay between sampling and completion of the analysis has 
been avoided when visible dyes are used as the signature chemical. (Visible dyes, or dyes, as 
such terminology is used herein, and as understood generally in the chemical field, are colored 
substances that bring about a significant degree of coloration in other materials when dispersed 
therein, which coloration characteristic is due to their strong absorption of electromagnetic 
radiation in the visible region, which extends from about 4000 to about 7000 Angstroms, or 
from about 400 to about 700 nm.) The presence, and often the concentration, of visible dyes 
can be determined on-site when a sufficient concentration of such dyes are employed. The 
primary advantage in using visible dyes is to permit analysis by sight. The color imparted to the 
water stream and/or system by visible dyes is nonetheless often a major disadvantage. The color 
gives the treated water stream and/or system a sinister and/or tainted appearance. The color 
normally persists, and taints the appearance of effluents and/or recycled fractions. The persistent 
color can even at times diminish the recycling potential of a waste water treatment process. 
Moreover, the concentration of visible dyes required for their monitoring purposes can add to the 
organic loading of the water stream

A process of monitoring a characteristic of a raw or waste 
water treatment process which characteristic is effected by the 

movement of water within the raw or waste treatment process 
comprising: 

adding to said raw or waste water treatment process at least

wherein said analysis at least detects the presence of said 
fluorescent species(s) in said sample, and
