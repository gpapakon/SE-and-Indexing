<ABSTRACT>
An antenna for metal detectors utilizable as a 
transmitter and/or receiver comprising multiple 

cylindrical supports (6,7,8) in insulating material each 
of which supports a winding (1,2,3) formed by a set of 

coils substantially in the form of a parallelogram of 
helicoid or flat extension, positioned concentrically or 

otherwise and connected in an adequate way to excitation 
and/or detection means for the generation of magnetic 

fields and/or the detection of their variations. The 
system of multiple cylindrical supports with the 

respective sets of coils is housed inside a tubular 
insulating support (5) suitable to protect the windings 

from possible external stress of mechanical nature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiple type 
antenna for metal detectors. More precisely, the invention relates to a column 
type antenna which can be used both as a transmitter and 
a receiver in a device for detecting the movement of 
metal objects, such as fire-arms, through passageways of 
guarded places (banks, jewelry stores, airports and the 
like). The transmission and reception antennas of currently 
available detectors are basically of two types. The 
first is a two-dimensional, rectangular form with coils 
which alternate to produce discordant magnetic polarities 
in order to attenuate the effects induced by external 
parasitic fields, with a reduction of the disturbances 
originating from a certain preferential direction. The second type is a cylindrical form with coils 
which constitute a helicoid winding so that they 
originate discordant magnetic polarities in order to 
attenuate disturbances coming from any direction. In both types of detectors an electric screen is 
provided for composed of a winding which follows the 
coils with its beginning connected to ground and its end 
left free; this is done to reduce the parasitic effects 
introduced by possible electrostatic effects. In both solutions the alternation of the magnetic 
polarities in the windings make it so that the external 
parasitic electromagnetic fields have alternatively 
discordant induced effects and can therefore be 
attenuated. Furthermore, in both solutions, along the 
generatrices of the flat and cylindrical antennas, the 
electromagnetic field irradiated by the transducer, used 
as a transmitter, changes intensity reaching minimum 
values in correspondence with the inversion of the 
magnetic polarity.  
 In those areas of minimum irradiation, improperly 
called "magnetic holes", the intensity of the 
electromagnetic field is so low that it induces, in a 
hypothetical metallic object crossing such an area, 
induced currents that are too weak to produce secondary 
inertial effects in the receiving transducer sufficient 
to produce an alarm. In other words, a metallic object, 
and naturally a weapon, can pass through these areas 
without being detected. While in the two-dimensional rectangular solution 
with flat coils the point in which the intensity of the 
electromagnetic field is too weak is well-defined by the 
geometry of the winding, in the solution of cylindrical 
form, with coils constituting a helicoid winding, that 
minimum field point can be translated along the 
generatrices of the support, rotating

<CLAIMS>
Antenna of multiple type for a metal detector comprising a 

plurality of single antenna elements having a helicoid 
winding wound over a cylindrical support, said helicoid 

winding extending over the whole extension of said 
cylindrical support, characterized in that said antenna 

elements have windings (1, 2, 3) wound on cylindrical 
supports constituted of hollow cylinders (6, 7, 8) that 

are arranged substantially concentrically the one into the 
other, and that said hollow cylinders (6, 7, 8) are singly 

rotatable around their axis and/or shiftable along it, 
whereby an adjustment of the transmitting and/or receiving 

characteristics may be obtained through a rotational 
positioning and/or shifting of each hollow cylinder (6, 7, 

8) with respect to the other (-s), in order to maximize the 
detection capabilities of the metal detector and to reduce 

parasitic effects.
