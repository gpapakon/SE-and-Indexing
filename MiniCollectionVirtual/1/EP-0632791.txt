<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing cement from metallurgical slags, liquid slags from reduction processes and siderurgical processes, such as for example blast furnace and converter slags, are mixed together and with lime. In a first cooling phase at temperature above 1000  DEG C, preferably above 1200  DEG C, slag is cooled down more slowly than in a second, subsequent cooling phase, and the solidified product thus obtained is granulated and/or ground, in order to directly give a cement with improved hydraulic properties, in particular an increased final resistance.

A process for producing cement from metallurgical slags, 
in which liquid slags from reduction processes and steelworks 

processes, such as, e.g., blast furnace and converter slags, 
are mixed with each other and, if required, are supplemented 

with lime, characterized in that in a first cooling phase at 
temperatures of above 1000°C, preferably above 1200°C, cooling 

is effected more slowly than in a second cooling phase 
following thereupon and that the solidified product obtained 

is granulated and/or ground. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
chlorides and/or chlorine-containing waste substances are 

added. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the melt is adjusted to temperatures of above 1700°C by 

an exothermic reaction with CaO. 
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the viscosity of the melt is lowered by adding CaF
2
. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that blast furnace and converter slag melts 

are used at a ratio of 30 to 80 % by weight of blast furnace 
slag to 20 to 70 % by weight of converter slag. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that cooling in the first cooling phase is 

effected at air using a centrifugal wheel. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that, following the first cooling phase, 

cooling is effected by means of water vapor and/or water.  
 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the melt clinker is charged to a 

fluidized bed or a fluidized bed cascade and cooled by means 
of 1.5 to 3.5 Nm
3
/kg clinker of cooling air over a period of 
time ranging from 15 to 40 minutes, preferably 25 to 30 

minutes, while solidifying to clinker granules having 
diameters of below 4 mm, preferably approximately 2.5 mm. 
A process according to claim 8, characterized in that 
cooling air drawn off at temperatures of between 900°C and 

1100°C is used as preheated combustion air.
