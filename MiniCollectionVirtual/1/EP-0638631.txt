<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lubricating compositions, greases, and 
aqueous fluids containing a dithiocarbamate compound and an organic 
polysulfide. These compositions possess improved antiwear or extreme 
pressure properties. Lubricating compositions, greases, and aqueous fluids are used to 
maintain a film of lubricant between surfaces that are moving with respect 
to each other. The compositions minimize contact of the moving surfaces 
thus preventing harmful wear to the surfaces. The compositions generally 
also lower the coefficient of friction. To be effective, the compositions 
should have sufficient antiwear, antiweld, and extreme pressure properties 
to minimize metal damage from metal-to-metal contact under high load 
conditions. Polysulfides have been used to provide extreme pressure protection 
to lubricating compositions. High levels of polysulfides generally lead to 
higher extreme pressure protection. However, high levels of polysulfides 
can lead to copper corrosion, seal compatibility, oxidation stability, and 
thermal stability problems. It is beneficial to find a material that when 
combined with a polysulfide has good extreme pressure properties without 
the adverse effects caused by high levels of polysulfide. Dithiocarbamate acid esters and their preparation have been 
described in U.S. Patent 2,710,872 (Thompson et al.), 2,897,152 (Elliott 
et al.), 3,890,360 (Malec), 3,833,496 (Malec), 4,064,265 (Varsanyi et al.), 
4,758,362 (Butke), 4,885,365 (Lam), and 4,957,643 (Lam). The sulfurized compositions prepared from unsaturated compounds 
and olefinic compounds have been described in U.S. Patents 4,119,549  
 
(Davis), 4,119,550 (Davis et al.), 4,191,659 (Davis), and 4,344,854 (Davis 
et al.). The invention provides a lubricating composition comprising (A) at 
least one dithiocarbamate compound, (B) at least one organic polysulfide, 
optionally, (C) a phosphorus or boron antiwear or extreme pressure agent, 
and (D) a base fluid selected from (i) an oil of lubricating viscosity, (ii) 
water and a surfactant or thickener, and (iii) an oil of lubricating viscosity 
and a thickener. In one aspect, the invention relates to a lubricating composition 
generally comprising a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity, (A) 
at least one dithiocarbamate compound, and (B) at least one organic 
polysulfide. The invention also relates to greases and aqueous 
compositions which contain the combination of (A) and (B). The 
compositions of the invention have good antiwear or extreme pressure 
pro
