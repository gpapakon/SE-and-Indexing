<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
for recovering fresh water and an apparatus for 
concentrating liquid, to both of which a film having 
excellent performance for preventing the formation of 
stationary drops of dew is applied. In depopulated areas such as remote islands and 
secluded places in the mountains, it is very important to 
obtain and keep safe drinking water. In recent years, 
further, with the desertification of agricultural fields, 
the conversion of desert to agricultural land is an 
important issue of development as well as a population 
problem, and water supply is a great problem to be solved 
for accomplishing the conversion of desert to agricultural 
land. When a large amount of seawater is desalinated, 
there is used a large-scale plant which uses an ionexchange 
method, a diaphragmatic osmosis method, a reverse 
osmosis method or a multi-flash method. These methods are 
effective for treating a large amount of seawater, but 
great expense is incurred for installing the plant, and a 
large amount of energy is also required for desalinating 
seawater. Therefore, the cost for desalinating seawater 
is high, and in most cases, it is difficult to install 
such a plant on a remote island or in a secluded place in 
the mountains in terms of plant cost and the supply of 
energy for the operation of the plant. Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings 
illustrates a known apparatus for recovering fresh water 
or concentrating liquid by means of solar energy, which 
apparatus is shown, for example, in a literature "Series 
of Books on Energy Science, No 5, Natural Energy", pages 
15 and 16, by Takuya Honma, et al, published 5 May 1980 by 
Kyoritsu Shuppan K K. This apparatus has a roof member 10 
made of glass or plastic, a base member 14, a liquid 
reservoir member 18 provided in the base member 14 and a 
liquid recovery member 16 provided in the base member 14.  In the above apparatus, sunlight which has 
transmitted through the roof member 10 increases the 
temperature inside the apparatus, and evaporates seawater 
stored in the liquid reservoir member 18. The evaporated 
water is condensed on the inner surface (to be sometimes 
referred to as "ceiling" hereinafter) of the roof member 
10 due to a temperature difference between the roof member 
exposed to atmosphere and the ceiling, whereby distilled 
water is obtained. However, the above apparatus has the following 
problem. Steam is condensed on the ceiling of the roof 
member 10, and the condensed water drops from the ceiling

Apparatus for distillation of a liquid 
comprising: a reservoir (18) for containing the liquid to 

be distilled; a condensing surface (10,12) on which liquid 
evaporated from the reservoir can condense; and a liquid 

receiving means (16) for collecting liquid running-off 
from the condensing surface (10,12); characterised in that 

the condensing surface is treated to be wettable.
