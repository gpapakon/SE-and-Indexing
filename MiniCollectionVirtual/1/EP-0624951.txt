<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit for slowly turning off a 
solid-state power transistor, particularly for 

inductive loads, comprising means (R1,R2,18) for 
limiting the load current flowing through the switch, 

and timing and control circuits (19,6,11,12,13) to 
ensure, irrespective of the duration of a command 

pulse, slowed turn-off of the switch with a 
predetermined delay as to the time when the maximum 

load current value is reached, thereby keeping the 
power dissipation through the switch during the load 

current limiting phase within predetermined values and 
the turn-off overvoltage within predetermined levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control circuit 
for slowly turning off a power transistor which 
controls an inductive load. It is a well-known fact that today's driver 
circuits for electric loads make ample use of solid 
state switching power devices, such as bipolar 
transistors, MOS-technology field-effect power 
transistors, and the like. Such devices are preferably operated to 
either a fully opened or fully closed condition, as 
against an adjusted condition, in order to minimize the 
switch power losses which occur primarily during short 
transients in switching from the open state to the 
closed state, and vice versa. The use of such devices for controlling 
basically inductive loads poses some serious problems 
which are still without a fully satisfactory solution. Considering, for example, a bipolar power 
transistor (of the NPN type) with its emitter grounded 
(optionally through a low-value resistor for measuring 
the emitter current) and its collector connected to a 
positive voltage supply VS through an inductive load L, 
it may be appreciated that the transistor can be 
brought to a closed condition from an open one with  
 
substantially no switching losses, since the current 
begins to flow through the load with a null initial 
value that grows linearly with the load inductance. Where the load resistance is negligible, very 
high current levels may be attained over time which may 
harm both the load and the switch. The problem is still more serious with 
inductive loads which incorporate ferromagnetic 
circuits. In that case, at certain current levels, the 
magnetic circuit becomes saturated and the load 
inductance drops sharply and drastically, resulting in 
rapid increase of the load current. To avoid such overload situations, it has 
long been known that switches intended for controlling 
inductive loads must be switched on for limited time 
periods correlated to the load inductance and to the 
highest allowable current, or as an alternative the 
switches must be provided with automatically operated 
load-limiting circuits effective to drive the switch 
from a state of full conduction to an intermediate 
control state which holds the load current at a 
predetermined level. However, such practices can only partially 
solve the problem.  
 In the former case, in fact, the fast 
switching off produces an overvoltage at the transistor 
collector which is higher, the faster is the switching 
off thereby the component may fail or the load 
malfunction or be harmed undesirably. In the latter
