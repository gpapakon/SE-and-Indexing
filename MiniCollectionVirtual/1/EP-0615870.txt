<ABSTRACT>
A utility vehicle is described with a hydropneumatic level controlled axle suspension, which comprises at least one double-acting operating cylinder (1), the cylinder chamber (2a) of which, located above a piston (5), interacts with a first accumulator (16), which is connected by way of a level control valve block (7) to the vehicle's own hydraulic pump (11), and the cylinder chamber (2b) of which, located below the piston (5), interacts with a second accumulator (25), which can be charged with hydraulic fluid by the hydraulic pump (11) by bypassing the level control valve block (7). In order to reduce the number of control valves needed, the second accumulator (25) can be connected, as required, by way of the level control valve block (7) to the first accumulator (16) and the cylinder chamber (2a) respectively. In addition a non-return valve (26), opening in the direction of the level control valve block (7), is situated in the pressure line (8) from the hydraulic pump (11) to the level control valve block (7) between the branches to other consumers (V1, V2) and the branch to the second accumulator (25).

<CLAIMS>
Operating vehicle having a hydropneumatic, level-controlled 
spring suspension system, which comprises at 

least one double-action control cylinder (1), of which 
the cylinder chamber (2a) situated above a piston (5) 

cooperates with a first accumulator (16), which is 
connected by a level-controlling valve block (7) to a 

hydraulic pump (11) of the vehicle, and the cylinder 
chamber (2b) situated below the piston (5) cooperates 

with a second accumulator (25), which may be charged 
with pressure fluid by the hydraulic pump (11) 

bypassing the level-controlling valve block (7),
 
characterized in
 
that the second accumulator (25), when required, is 

connectable by the level-controlling valve block (7) to 
the first accumulator (16) and the cylinder chamber 

(2a) and in the pressure line (8) from the hydraulic 
pump (11) to the level-controlling valve block (7) a 

non-return valve (26) opening in the direction of the 
level-controlling valve block (7) lies between the 

branches leading to the further loads (V1, V2) and the 
branch leading to the second accumulator (25). 
Operating vehicle according to claim 1,
 
characterized in
 
that the level-controlling valve block (7) comprises 

two 2/2-way valves (14, 15) which are operable 
independently of one another. 
Operating vehicle according to claims 1 and 2,
 
characterized in
 
that the cylinder chambers (2a, 2b) may be shut off 

from the accumulators (16, 25) by means of shut-off 
valves (28, 29). 
Operating vehicle according to claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in
 
that the spring suspension system may be shut off  

 
either manually or automatically in dependence upon 

preset operating criteria such as, for example, the 
driving speed. 
Operating vehicle according to claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in
 
that the accumulator (25) has a greater capacity than 

the accumulator (16). 
Operating vehicle according to claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized by
 
a pressure switch (27) which monitors the pressure in 

the pressure line (24) for an upper and a lower limit 
value, a drop below the lower limit value temporarily 

effecting a connection to system of the pump (11).
