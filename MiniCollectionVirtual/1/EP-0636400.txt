<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for separating a multicomponent gas mixture 
comprising at least three components into three product streams by means of 

adsorbent membrane zones operating in series. Each product is enriched in 
a different component based upon the relative strength of adsorption of 

each component on the adsorbent material. A non-permeate primary component 
product is obtained by the selective adsorption and permeation through the 

adsorbent membranes of secondary components which are more strongly 
adsorbed than the primary components in the gas mixture. Two or more 

permeate streams enriched in more the strongly adsorbed components are 
withdrawn from the membrane zones as individual secondary products, each of 

which contains a different component distribution determined by the 
relative strength of adsorption of the secondary components on the 

adsorbent material. Increased recovery and product purity are realized by 
the integration of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and cryogenic separation 

systems with the adsorbent membrane zones. PSA reject gas is used as a 
membrane sweep gas to increase the permeation rates of secondary 

components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed towards the separation of gas mixtures by
adsorptive membranes, and in particular to the recovery and fractionation
of hydrocarbons from hydrogen-hydrocarbon mixtures.Gas separation by adsorbent membranes is a separation method
which exhibits superior performance characteristics for many gas mixtures
compared with well-known separation methods using polymeric or porous bulk
diffusion membranes. Adsorbent membranes are particularly useful for the
recovery of light gases such as hydrogen from mixtures containing other
components, wherein these other components selectively permeate through the
membrane and hydrogen is recovered as a non-permeate product at a pressure
only slightly below the feed pressure. By comparison, polymeric membranes
operate in an opposite mode in which the hydrogen selectively permeates
through the membrane and is recovered at a pressure far lower than the feed
pressure, and other components are recovered in a non-permeate stream at a
pressure slightly below the feed pressure. The characteristics and methods
of making adsorbent membranes are described in U.S. -A- 5,104,425.Staged membranes in series are disclosed in the art in which either
the permeate or non-permeate stream from a first stage is passed to one or
more additional stages to improve efficiency and/or recovery of the
component being recovered. U.S. -A- 4,180,388 discloses a two-stage
membrane system in which the non-permeate stream from the first stage
passes to a second stage for additional permeate recovery. The feed to 
permeate pressure ratio in the first stage is lower than the feed to
permeate pressure ratio of the second stage. Polymeric membranes are
taught for use in the process. U.S. -A- 4,435,191 teaches the use of
three membrane stages in series for recovering an aggressive gas such as
CO2 by permeation through polymeric membranes. The feed through the stages
is compressed between the stages such that each stage operates at a
successively higher pressure on the feed side. U.S. -A- 4,623,704
discloses the recovery of an enriched ethylene stream from polyethylene
polymerization off-gas containing unreacted ethylene. The recovered
unreacted ethylene stream comprises the combined permeate streams from
three membrane modules in series, each module having a solid semipermeable
membrane such as cellulose acetate. U.S. -A- 4,104,037 teaches a
multi-stage gaseous diffusion system for separating uranium isotopes in the
form of gaseous fluorides. The diffusion stages utilize porous membranes

A method for separating a gas mixture containing one or more
primary components and two or more secondary components, wherein said

secondary components are more strongly adsorbed on a certain adsorbent material
than said primary components, and wherein the relative adsorptive characteristics

of said secondary components on said adsorbent material range
from most strongly adsorbed secondary components to least strongly adsorbed

secondary components, said method comprising:

(a) passing a feed stream comprising said gas mixture successively
through two or more membrane zones in series, each membrane

zone having a permeable adsorbent membrane
which divides the zone into a feed side and a permeate side,

said membrane comprising said adsorbent material and a porous substrate so associated therewith that the adsorbent
material is a coating thereon or is at least partly contained within the pores thereof so that the separation effect is due

to the selective adsorption of the respective component by the adsorbent material and the
permeation of said adsorbed component through the membrane in the form of an adsorbed fluid

phase, 
wherein said feed stream passes successively in series through the

feed side of each membrane zone such that the nonpermeate gas from a
given membrane zone provides the feed to the succeeding membrane

zone, wherein said feed stream is depleted of the most strongly
adsorbed secondary components in the first of said membrane zones and

the least strongly adsorbed secondary components in the last of said
membrane zones, and withdrawing from the feed side of the last of

said membrane zones a final membrane product stream substantially
depleted of said secondary components; and
(b) withdrawing from the permeate side of each successive
membrane zone a secondary component permeate stream, wherein the

permeate stream from the first of said membrane zones is enriched in
the most strongly adsorbed secondary components and the permeate

stream from the last of said membrane zones is enriched in the least
strongly adsorbed secondary components;

wherein portions of said secondary components are adsorbed from said feed
