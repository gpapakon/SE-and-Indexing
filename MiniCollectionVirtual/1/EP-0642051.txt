<ABSTRACT>
A reconfigurable optical beam splitter (2) and method establishes 
replicated periods of optical phase shift regions across 

a liquid crystal cell (2) to form an optical grating in the 
liquid crystal. A non-linear pattern of phase shift regions 

is established within each period of the grating to split an 
input beam (16) into a multi-beam output (18a, 18b, 18c), or 

to combine multiple input beams (18a, 18b, 18c) into a single 
output beam (16). The desired pattern of phase shift regions 

is established by applying corresponding voltage differentials 
across the cell, between an electrode array (4) on one side 

of the cell and a common counter electrode on the other side. 
The voltage differential pattern can be dynamically changed 

to impart a corresponding dynamic reconfiguration of the output 
beam pattern. The most efficient voltage differential pattern 

for any particular output is established by initially selecting 
a tentative voltage differential pattern, determining the optical 

efficiency of the processing method with the tentative pattern, 
and then applying a non-linear optimization algorithm to derive 

a voltage differential pattern that corresponds to a maximum 
optical efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the division of an input 
optical beam into an array of multiple output beams, or the 
reverse process in which multiple input beams are combined 
into a single output beam, and more particularly to such a 
beam reconfiguration that is accomplished by controlling an 
electrode array in a liquid crystal cell. With the emergence of fiber optic communications and 
the extensive use of optical links in general, there is a 
need for systems that can manipulate optical signals with 
a greater degree of flexibility and adaptability than has 
previously been available (the term "optical" as used herein 
includes infrared, ultraviolet and other regions of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, and is not limited to visible 
light). One optical processing function that is of particular 
interest for the present invention is a star coupler, 
in which light from one input beam is distributed to multiple 
output beams that diverge from each other, or multiple 
converging input beams are combined into a single output 
beam. Optical beam division and combination have previously 
been performed by stationary or mobile mirrors with complete 
or partial reflectivity, refractive or holographic 
lenses, prisms and fixed grating rulings. For example, 
periodic mechanical structures in the form of grooves, multi-pinhole  
 
masks and faults in periodic structures are employed 
for beam splitting in Dammann et al., "Coherent optical 
generation and inspection of two-dimensional periodic 
structures", Optica Acta, Vol. 24, No. 4, 1977, pages 505-515, 
while a binary phase grating with arbitrarily shaped 
grooves to implement a star coupler is described in Killat 
et al., "Binary Phase Gratings for Star Couplers with High 
Splitting Ratio", Fiber and Integrated Optics, Vol. 4, No. 
2, 1982, pages 159-167. Such opto-mechanical devices are 
bulky and sluggish, and are designed to operate on a fixed 
number of optical beams at fixed prescribed angles and 
spacings. Major structural modifications are required to 
reconfigure the systems to handle beams with different angles 
of incidence and transmission. Dynamic control over beam processing has been achieved 
with the use of multiple electrode systems in a liquid crystal 
cell. However, these systems have been limited to 
deflecting a single input beam into a single beam output. 
While the angle of deflection can be dynamically varied, an 
incident beam is not divided into multiple outputs, nor are 
multiple converging inputs combined into a single output.
