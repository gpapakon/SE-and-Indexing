<ABSTRACT>
Bedding configurations (10) are disclosed having supporting surfaces (25) 
the firmness of which may be selectively adjustable by remote control 

means (28, 30), providing for a supporting surface (25) which may be 
quickly and easily adjusted by a user for maximum comfort. Various air 

chambers (26), cylinders, and tubes are disclosed for use in the central or 
"lumbar" portions of the mattresses (12) of such bedding configurations 

(10), which may be selectively inflated or deflated in order to provide 
corresponding firmness levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to bedding, and
more particularly to bedding configurations having
supporting surfaces the firmness of which may be
selectively adjustable by remote control means, providing
for a personnalized supporting surface which may be
quickly and easily adjusted by a user for maximum
comfort.In bedding configurations, a need has been recognized for
such configurations which provide comfortable supporting
surfaces. However, different users of bedding
configurations may have different concepts of comfort;
one user may desire a less firm sleeping surface while
another may desire a more firm surface. This problem is
compounded when two different users, such as a husband
and wife, have different bedding firmness preferences but
wish to sleep in the same bed.Difficulties can also arise if the same user has
different bedding needs at different times, such as when
that user's back pains prompt a need for a sleeping
surface having a different firmness than the norm.Therefore, it may be seen that a need exists for a
bedding configuration which provides an improved
supporting surface which may be adjustable to satisfy the
various needs of its users, has improved wear
characteristics, and is less likely to require periodic
turning of the mattress. The present invention provides an improvement over the
prior art by providing an improved supporting surface
which may be infinitely adjustable within a particular
firmness range, and also may be adjusted to exhibit
different firmness for each side of the bed.To this end, the present invention provides an
innerspring construction,
comprising a plurality of adjacent rows of barrel-shaped
pocketed coils having substantially parallel
longitudinal axes and being placed in a side-to-side
position, such a construction is for instance known
from US-A-4 566 926. The invention is
characterized in that a group of said barrel-shaped
pocketed coils is constituted by half-size
pocketed coils located at a predetermined area of the
construction and forming an upper layer of half-size
pocketed coils which terminate in flush aligment with the
upper surface of the full-size pocketed coils in the
construction, and in that an inflatable chamber is
positioned under the upper layer of half-size pocketed
coils and may be selectively inflated to displace
upwardly the upper layer of half-size pocketed coils.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
bedding configuration having an improved supporting
surface.It is a further object of the present invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An innerspring construction, comprising a plurality of
adjacent rows of barrel-shaped pocketed coils (88; 106)

having substantially parallel longitudinal axes and being
placed in a side-to-side position, characterized in that

a group of said barrel-shaped pocketed coils is
constituted by half-size pocketed coils located at a

predetermined area of the construction and forming an
upper layer (90) of half-size pocketed coils which

terminate in flush aligment with the upper surface of the
full-size pocketed coils in the construction, and in that

an inflatable chamber (91, 92; 108) is positioned under
the upper layer of half-size pocketed coils and may be

selectively inflated to displace upwardly the upper layer
of half-size pocketed coils.
An innerspring construction according to claim 1,
characterized in that said inflatable chamber (108)

occupies all the free space beneath the upper layer of
half-pocketed coils.
An innerspring construction according to claim 1,
characterized in that it comprises a lower layer (90) of

half-size pocketed coils positioned so that inflatable
chamber is sandwiched between the upper and lower layers

of half-size pocketed coils.
An innerspring construction according to claim 1,
characterized in that it further comprises a lumbar

support member (115) positioned a top said inflatable
chamber and beneath the upper layer of half-size pocketed

coils such that the half-size pocketed coils exhibit a
slight upward bulge.
An innerspring construction according to any preceding
claims, characterized in that it further comprises a top 

padding layer (85) positioned atop all of said pocketed
coils (88; 106).
An innerspring construction according to any preceding
claims, characterized in that it further comprises means

(93, 94, 96; 110, 11, 112) for inflating said inflatable
chamber.
An innerspring construction according to any preceding
claims, characterized in that it is used as a mattress

having a head region and a foot region each constituted
by full-size pocketed coils; and a center region

constituted by said area of half-size pocketed coils
under which is positioned said inflatable chamber.
