<ABSTRACT>
A solution for use in electroplating which comprises 
at least one monovalent metal such as copper, silver or 

gold which is complexed by a thiosulfate ion; and a 
stabilizer of an organic sulfinate compound such as, for 

example, one having the formula R-SO₂-X wherein R is an 
alkyl, heterocyclic or aryl moiety and X is a monovalent 

cation. The stabilizer is present in an amount 
sufficient to stabilize the thiosulfate ion when the 

solution is operated at an acidic pH of less than 7. 
Also, the solution is substantially free of cyanide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cyanide-free 
electroplating solution for depositing monovalent copper, 
silver, gold and other metals. Copper plating has been successfully accomplished 
for many years from cyanide-based plating solutions. In 
these solutions, copper is present as the monovalent 
copper cyanide complex. The solution may also contain 
free or uncomplexed alkali cyanide, alkali hydroxide and 
complexing agents such as alkali-tartrate to help 
dissolve copper anodes. Although these solutions have 
been successful, the industry has constantly been in 
search of a substitute for the poisonous cyanide ions. Acidic divalent copper solutions have been 
commercially successful and are free of cyanide; however, 
these divalent solutions require twice as much total 
current to deposit the same amount of copper as do 
monovalent copper solutions. Furthermore, the acidic 
solutions cannot achieve the proper adhesion of copper 
when plating directly onto steel. Alkaline divalent copper solutions have achieved 
limited commercial acceptance. These solutions are free 
of cyanide and are capable of plating directly onto steel 
with good adhesion. Since copper is divalent, however, 
the plating rate for a given amount of current is the 
same as that obtained from acidic divalent copper 
solutions. To date, there are no commercially successful 
monovalent copper plating baths that are free of cyanide, 
stable, and capable of plating directly onto steel with 
good adhesion.  
 Cuprous halides with excess alkali halides have been 
proposed in the form of chlorides or iodides. Neither of 
these have reached commercial acceptance. U.S. Patent 1,969,553 describes a process for 
plating monovalent copper based on a solution containing 
sodium thiosulfate and cuprous chloride. This process 
was studied further and reported at the 77th general 
meeting of the Electrochemical Society, April 26, 1940. 
A more recent study of the cuprous thiosulfate bath was 
reported in May 1981 at the annual technical conference 
of the Institute for Metal Finishing at Harrogate, U.K. 
These baths plated copper from monovalent solutions in 
which copper was complexed with a thiosulfate ion. It 
was reported that the stability of the bath was further 
improved with the addition of a sulfite ion. The pH of 
the solutions was in the range of 6 to 11, with the 
optimum range being 8.5 to 9.5. Acidic solutions having 
a pH of 6 or less were reported to be unstable and sulfur 
dioxide, resulting from the acidified sulfite ion,
