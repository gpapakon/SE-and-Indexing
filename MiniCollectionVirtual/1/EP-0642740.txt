<ABSTRACT>
Fermented milk having a value of b standing for the slope of more than 0.17 when, in the range giving the 
minimum decreasing rate of viscosity within the range of from r = 10⁻¹ to r = 10²S⁻¹ in the shear rate dependence test 

of static modulus, the decreasing rate is substituted into the formula 

y = ax
-b
 
. A process for producing said fermented 

milk which comprises blending a yogurt mix with a peroxidase and a whey protein concentrate and/or isolated whey 
protein followed by fermentation with lactic acid bacteria. Fermented milk, in particular, hard yogurt having a smooth 

texture and reduced separation of whey can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fermented milk with smooth
construction and reduced separation of whey and a processes
for the production thereof. The fermented milk has fine
velvety texture and smooth construction, thus mildly
disintegrate in the mouth with excellent sensory taste.Fermented milk is prepared by inoculation of lactic
acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus,
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium species to
milk or raw milk with added sweeteners, flavors, stabilizers
and so forth, hereinafter called yogurt mix, followed by
fermentation. The lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid
during fermentation process and the produced lactic acid
lowers pH of the fermented mixture to form gel by
coagulation of milk protein and to give fermented milk.The mechanism of gelling of fermented milk is not
completely elucidated but its physical properties are
largely depend on the fermentation conditions of lactic acid
bacteria and strict control of the quality of raw materials, 
activity of the microorganisms and fermentation temperature
are required to give product with satisfactorily quality.
However, no complete and satisfactory fermented milk has
always been obtained and numerous physical problems such as
separation of whey, and coarse and rough construction remain
to be solved. Particularly, consumers tend to dislike the
separation of whey. Generally, stabilizers such as gelatin,
pectin and agar, and whey protein concentrate (WPC) have been
added to fermented milk to give products with suitable
hardness and improved water retention, and soft and pleasant
feeling to the tongue.However, ameliorated water retention and smoothness by
the addition of physical property improving agents such as
stabilizers resulted in raised hardness and coarse and rough
feeling in the mouth. Heretofore, selection of optimal
strain of lactic acid bacteria and modifications of
production conditions have been applied in addition to the
use of stabilizers for the prevention of separation of whey.
However, no satisfactorily fermented milk has still been
obtained. For example, World Published Patent Application
WO 92/13064 discloses the addition of peroxidase at
concentrations of one mg/L or over to the fermented milk to
suppress the excessive raise of acidity of the products
during distribution and storage, and to maintain suitable
acidity during palatable period. Japanese Published
Unexamined Patent Application (Japan Kokai) No. 228224 
(1987) discloses
