<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides stable, aqueous, hygiene 
compositions comprising aqueous-insoluble or sparingly 

soluble organic peroxy acids can be prepared by the use of 

a water-immiscible solvent for the organic peroxy acid in 
the form of an emulsion in water. In the context of the 

present invention aqueous-insoluble or sparingly soluble 
organic peroxy acids are those peroxy acids having a 

solubility in water at 10°C of less than 100ppm. 
Compositions according to the invention comprise: at least 
100 ppm of a water insoluble or sparingly soluble hygiene 

agent (a), and, at least 0.1% of a water-immiscible 
solvent for (a), said solvent comprising the dispersed 

phase of a solvent/water emulsion. Typically the 
bleaching agent (a) is an organic peroxy acid. Typically, 

the peroxy acid is an imido peroxy-carboxylic acid, most 
preferably e-N-N-phthaloyl-amino-peroxycaproic acid (PAP).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in bleaching
and hygiene compositions and will be described with
particular reference to bleaching and hygiene compositions
for use on hard surfaces such as ceramics, plastics and
metals. The specification relates generally to
compositions which contain bleaching agents of low aqueous
solubility.For many years it has been known to employ hydrogen
peroxide as a water soluble bleaching and hygiene agent.
To a lesser extent, other peroxides such as sodium
peroxide have been employed, as have soluble peracids,
such as peracetic acid, either as such or as precursors
such as tetra acetyl ethylene diamine, as well as
performic acid and potassium mono persulphate.Aqueous-insoluble or sparingly soluble peracids have also
been investigated with particular reference to their use
in fabric bleaching compositions and in machine
dishwashing applications. If such compositions are
formulated as liquids, a thickening agent must be present
in order to suspend the insoluble or sparingly soluble
bleaching agent. US patent 3996152 discloses stable low-pH gels containing
almost insoluble peroxyacid bleach particles in a non-starch
thickening agent. Aqueous suspensions of diperoxydodecanedioic
acid (DPDA) are known for use as pourable
bleaching compositions from EP 0176124. Another form of
DPDA suspension useful as an aqueous liquid bleaching
composition is disclosed in EP 0160342. DPDA is an
organic peroxy acid, relatively stable to decomposition,
odourless and particularly effective as an anti-bacterial
hygiene agent as compared with hydrogen peroxide, but
suffers from the disadvantage that it can explode if
crystallised in relatively pure form.European patent application EP 0160342 (Unilever, 1984)
discloses aqueous liquid bleaching compositions containing
organic peroxyacid particles having a solubility of less
than about 1% in water, suspended in an acidic surfactant-structured
liquid containing alkyl benzene sulphonate and
electrolyte: the preferred peroxy acid being DPDA. It is
believed that the combination of alkyl benzene sulphonate
and electrolyte forms a lamellar-dispersion thickening
system which suspends the almost insoluble DPDA particles.EP 0435379 (AKZO, 1989) relates to the use of imidoperoxycarboxylic
acids in bleaching compositions in soaking
detergents and dishwashing detergents. Preferred
compositions include e-N-N-phthaloyl-amino-peroxy-caproic
acid (PAP) and DPDA, as mentioned above. PAP is less
explosive that DPDA and has comparable stability to
decompositio
