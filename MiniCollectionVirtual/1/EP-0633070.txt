A process of powder coating of workpieces, in which
initially a workpiece (10) is coated with powder (12), so that

the powder adheres to the workpiece (10), and the powder (12)
adhering to the workpiece (10) is subsequently irradiated with

electromagnetic radiation within a defined surface portion
(14), so that the powder within said defined surface portion

(14) will gelate and stick to the workpiece (10), and the
colour powder which adheres to the workpiece outside the

defined surface portion is removed after the electromagnetic
irradiation, characterised in that the emission wavelength of

the electromagnetic radiation is matched with the absorption
wavelength of the used powder (12, 16) so as to initiate a

crosslinking in the powder (12) after the electromagnetic
irradiation in an oven.
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
the workpiece (10) is irradiated with infrared light.
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
the workpiece (10) is irradiated with ultraviolet light.
The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the workpiece (10) is electrostatically

coated with colour powder (12) and that the colour powder
adhering to the workpiece outside of said defined surface area

(14) is removed by blowing.
The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that for coating the workpiece with different

colour powders said workpiece (10) is successively coated with
a respective one of said colour powders (12) and is irradiated

within a respective defined surface portion (14) allotted to 
the respective colour, and that excessive colour powder

outside of the respective allotted surface portion is blown
off, that the coating, irradiating and blowing operations on

the workpiece are repeated for every additional colour (16,
18), and that upon completion of the application of the

various colour powders (12, 16) to the workpiece (10) the
colour powders are baked in said oven.
The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims 2, 4
or 5, characterised in that an IR-laser (20) is used to emit

the infrared light, and scans the defined surface portion 814,
18) of the workpiece.
The process as claimed in any of claims 2, 4 or 5,
characterised in that a focused Nernst stylus (20) including a

suitable optical system is used to emit said infrared light,
said Nernst stylus emitting a flow of energy directed to said

defined surface portion (14, 18) of the workpiece (10).
The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims 3 to
5, characterised in that an UV-radiation source (20) is used

to emit said ultraviolet light and emits a flow of energy
directed to said defined surface portion (14, 18) of the

workpiece (10).
The process as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that
the IR-laser (20) is coupled to a computer so as to transfer a

digitised pattern directly onto the surface of the workpiece
(10).
The process as claimed in any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the powder (12, 16) adhering to the

workpiece (10) is heated upon irradiation for about 2 to 5
seconds at a maximum of about 160°C.
The process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the powder (12, 16) adhering to the 

workpiece (10) is heated upon irradiation for about 5 seconds
at about 160°C.
