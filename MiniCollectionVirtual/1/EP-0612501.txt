<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a patient examination 
table (1) for medical examinations, comprising a 

support structure (2), a patient rest surface (34), 
first movement means (19,26,30) to rotate the 

patient rest surface (34) in two directions about a 
horizontal axis (X), potentially covering an 

angular range of not less than 180 degrees, and a 
second movement means (5,10,11) to translate the 

patient rest surface (34) vertically in both 
directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an examination 
table which can be varied in height and angle for 
use in the performing of various medical 
examinations, especially radiological examinations 
such as stratigraphy, mammography, tomography, or 
endoscopic examinations, where wide-ranging 
patient position changes are needed in order to 
carry out all of the examinations correctly. Prior art examination tables relating to the above 
field are equipped with blocking elements to 
constrain the supine patient to the table, and are 
inferiorly solid to a slide element having a 
horizontal-axis part-cylindrical shape, with the 
arched portion inferiorly arranged. This slide 
element is inferiorly supported and can perform 
oscillations about its own axis on command of 
special movement means which bring the patient 
into all the positions necessary for the 
examinations, starting from a vertical position 
with head up to a slightly inclined position with  
 
respect to a horizontal plane, with the patient's 
head slightly below his feet. Owing to well-known 
geometrical problems, a so-conformed slide element 
together with its support elements cannot bring the 
patient into a position where his head is 
considerably below the level of his feet, nor, 
obviously, where the patient is in a vertical 
head-down position. Numerous examinations would be 
more efficiently carried out if the above-described 
positions were possible. In the Patent US-A-4 960 271 is disclosed an 
apparatus with a tilting table for X-ray 
examination. The structure of the apparatus for 
supporting a patient comprises a base anchored on 
the floor with an upright standard. The standard 
has vertical rails which are engaged by linear 
bearings on an carriage which rides up and down; on 
the carriage is a rotary bearing on which is 
attached a cantilever beam extending horizontally 
from the standard. At the free end of the 
cantilever beam there are two rotary bearings in 
which is journaled the stub shaft of a table 
bracket. To the table bracket is secured a table 
top adapted to support the patient under 
examination and extending at right angle to the  
 
longitudinal axis of the beam. For rotating the 
patient table, the latter comprises a screw 
mechanism driven by a motor. Due to the particular 
mechanism, only limited rotations of the table are 
permitted: this because such an inclination is 
directed only to the Trendelemburg effect. In the patent FR-A-2 291 733 is disclosed a patient 
support arrangement for an X-ray apparatus.

<CLAIMS>
A patient examination table for medical 
examinations, comprising a support structure (2), 

a patient rest surface (34) connected to the 
support structure (2), first movement means (19, 

26, 30) for rotating the patient rest surface 
(34) in two directions about a horizontal axis 

(X), said first movement means (19, 26, 30) 
comprising a support element (22, 23) and first 

motor means (30) coupled to said support element 
(22, 23) for performing such rotations; second 

movement means (5, 10, 11) for vertically 
translating the patient rest surface (34) up and 

down, said second movement means (5, 10, 11) 
comprising a frame (12, 15) provided with guide 

means (13), characterised in that said guide 
means (13) of the second movement means (5, 10, 

11) are disposed internally to the support 
structure (2) and supporting the patient rest 

surface (34); in that the support element (22, 
23) defines an aperture (16, 20), said support  

 
element (22, 23) being ro
tatably supported by 
said frame (12, 15); and in that said first 

movement means are keyed and acting on the 
support element (22, 23) in such a way that the 

patient rest surface (34) can rotate about the 
horizontal axis (X) to a range of not less than 

180 degrees. 
A patient examination table as in claim 1, 
characterised in that the second movement means 

comprise at least one screw-nut device (5, 11) 
equipped with a screw (5) and a nut (11); the nut 

(11) being connected to the patient rest surface 
(34), and second bi-directional motor means (10) 

being provided for setting each screw element (5) 
in rotation. 
A patient examination table as in claim 1, 
characterised in that the support element 

comprises a disc (23) having an axis which 
coincides with the horizontal axis (X); the 

first motor means (30) being supported on the 
disc (23).  

 
A patient examination table as in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that it 

comprises first sensor means (35, 16) of a 
vertical position occupied by the patient rest 

surface (34).  
 
A patient examination table as in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that it 

comprises second sensor means of the angular 
position occupied by the patient rest surface 

(34) with respect to the horizontal axis (X).
