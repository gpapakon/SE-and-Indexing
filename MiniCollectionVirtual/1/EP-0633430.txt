<ABSTRACT>
A fluidized bed combustion system in which a 
separator (30) receives a mixture of flue gases and entrained 

particulate material from a fluidized bed in a furnace (10). A 
pressure seal valve, in the form of two ducts (36,40), connects an 

outlet of the separator to the furnace for recycling the 
separated particulate material back to the furnace. A 

pressure head builds up in one of the ducts and air is 
introduced to the other duct to dampen pressure 

fluctuations in the furnace and promote the flow of the 
particulate material back to the furnace.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluidized bed combustion
system and method, and, more particularly, to such a
system and method in which an improved pressure seal is
provided between the furnace section of the fluidized bed
and the separating section.Fluidized bed combustion systems are well known and
include a furnace section in which air is passed through a
bed of particulate material, including a fossil fuel, such
as coal, and a sorbent for the oxides of sulfur generated
as a result of combustion of the coal, to fluidize the bed
and to promote the combustion of the fuel at a relatively
low temperature. These types of combustion systems are
often used in steam generators in which water is passed in
a heat exchange relationship to the fluidized bed to
generate steam and permit high combustion efficiency and 
fuel flexibility, high sulphur adsorption and low nitrogen
oxides emissions.The most typical fluidized bed utilized in the
furnace section of these type systems is commonly referred
to as a "bubbling" fluidized bed in which the bed of
particulate material has a relatively high density and a
well-defined, or discrete, upper surface. Other types of
systems utilize a "circulating" fluidized bed in which the
fluidized bed density is below that of a typical bubbling
fluidized bed, the fluidizing air velocity is equal to or
greater than that of a bubbling bed, and the flue gases
passing through the bed entrain a substantial amount of
the fine particulate solids to the extent that they are
substantially saturated therewith.Circulating fluidized beds are characterized by
relatively high internal and external solids recycling
which makes them insensitive to fuel heat release
patterns, thus minimizing temperature variations and,
therefore, stabilizing the sulphur emissions at a low
level. The external solids recycling is achieved by
disposing a cyclone separator at the furnace section
outlet to receive the flue gases, and the solids entrained
thereby, from the fluidized bed. The solids are separated 
from the flue gases in the separator and the flue gases
are passed to a heat recovery area while the solids are
recycled back to the furnace. This recycling improves the
efficiency of the separator, and the resulting increase in
the efficient use of sulphur adsorbent and fuel residence
time reduces the adsorbent and fuel consumption.In the circulating fluidized bed arrangements, it is
important that a pressure seal be provided between the
separator and the furnace section to prevent backflow of
gases, with entrained
