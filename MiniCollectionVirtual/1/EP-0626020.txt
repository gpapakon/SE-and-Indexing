<ABSTRACT>
Described is a knitted fabric made up of several layers, the outer layers (26) having a higher moisture-absorption power than the inner layers, moisture thus being transferred from the inner layers (18) (i.e. those close to the skin) to the outer layers.

Multilayer, highly elastic knitware for medical stockings, tights, 
gussets, fine ladies' stockings or the like, wherein the inner layer (18) 

close to the skin displays a lower moisture absorption capacity than the 
layer (19, 20) lying further outwards and the layer (19, 20) lying 

further outwards consists of a thread of multicapillary material, 
characterised thereby, that the article is circularly knitted of elastic 

or elastomeric yarns, the number of the single filaments of which in the 
layer (19, 20) lying further outwards is about equal to or greater than 

the number of the yarn thickness in dtex, wherein one layer with floating 
threads (14) functions as further, aforementioned inner layer close to 

the skin. 
Knitware according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the number 
of the capillaries is equal to or greater than the number of the yarn 

thickness (dtex). 
Knitware according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that 
three or more layers are present. 
Knitware according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby, that the inner layer is knitted with a thread of commercially 

usual polyamide. 
Knitware according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby, that the thread for the inner layer displays a fineness in the 

region of dtex 78 f 23. 
Knitware according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby, that the layers lying further outwards are knitted of a thread 

with a fineness in the region of dtex 78 f 78. 
Knitware according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby, that the layers lying further outwards are knitted of a thread 

with a fineness in the region of dtex 85 f 92.
