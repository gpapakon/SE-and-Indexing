<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain N-benzyl heterocyclic 
compounds, to processes for their preparation and 
to their uses as biocides, for example, as pesticides. N-benzyl heterocyclic compounds have been relatively 
widely investigated in the past. For example, JP 63287764 
(Nihon Tokushu Noyaku) discloses 1-(3-cyanobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)imidazoline, 
1-(3-cyanobenzyl)-2-(nitro-imino)imidazoline 
and 1-(3-cyanobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)tetrahydropyrimidine 
compounds. It is stated that the 
compounds are useful as insecticides, effective against 
Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera and Diptera. DE OS 25 14 402 A1 (Hoechst) discloses certain 2-(nitromethylene)imidazolidine 
and 2-(nitromethylene)hexahydropyrimidine 
compounds which are stated to be insecticidal. 
The document specifically discloses 1-benzyl-2-(nitromethylene)imidazoline 
and 1-benzyl-2-(nitromethylene)hexahydropyrimidine. DE OS 27 32 660 (Hoechst) discloses certain insecticidal 
2-(nitromethylene)imidazolidine compounds. 
Specific examples disclosed include 1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)imidazolidine, 
1-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-2(nitromethylene)imidazolidine, 
1-(2-chlorobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)imidazolidine 
and 1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)imidazolidine. European Patent Publication No. 136 636 (Nihon 
Tokushu Noyaku Seizo) discloses 2-(nitromethylene)tetrahydropyrimidine 
derivatives which are stated to be insecticidal. 
Specfic examples disclosed include 1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)tetrahydropyrimidine, 
1-(4-bromobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)tetrahydropyrimidine  
 
and 1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-2-(nitromethylene)tetrahydropyrimidine. This invention is based upon the discovery of interesting 
pesticidal activity of certain N-(3-fluorobenzyl)heterocyclic 
compounds. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a compound of general formula: 
in which n is 1, 2 or 3; R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ independently 
represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group; X represents 
an oxygen atom or a group >CR⁵R⁶, >NR⁷, >NCOR⁸ or >S(O)p, 
where R⁵, R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ independently represent a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group and p is 0, 1 or 2; A represents an 
optionally substituted 3-fluorobenzyl group; and Y 
represents a group =CH- or =N-. It has been found that the presence of a 3-fluorobenzyl 
group tends to lead to increased pesticidal 
activity of compounds of general formula I in comparison 
to similar compounds wherein A represents, for example, a 
3-chlorobenzyl, a 3-bromobenzyl or an unsubstituted benzyl 
gro
