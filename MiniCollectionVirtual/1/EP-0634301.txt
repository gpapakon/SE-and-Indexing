<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a structure for the manual acceleration 
in a vehicle comprising a steering wheel (1; 101; 102), a manual 

acceleration element (9; 109; 209'), a hub (4; 104; 204) integral with said 
steering wheel (1; 101; 102) and coupled to the steering column, a system 

comprising at least one rod element (8; 108; 208) and at least one bearing 
element (2; 102; 202) slidably coupled each other, provided between said 

steering wheel (1; 101; 102) and said manual acceleration element (9; 
109; 209), in such a way to allow the axial movement of the latter with 

respect to the steering wheel (1; 101; 102), and motion transfer means for 
transmitting the axial motion of the manual acceleration element to the 

vehicle accelerator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a structure for the manual
acceleration of a vehicle, and more specifically a structure of the above
mentioned kind that allows to obtain the transmission of the motion
manually communicated on the steering wheel to the accelerator pedal.Devices of the kind described in the present invention have
been realized and patented since many years ago.For example, the same Applicant has realized a manual
accelerator that was the subject of the Italian patent N° 1,035,222, and a
subsequent improvement described in the Italian N° 1,079,429,
corresponding to FR-A-2412437, on the basis of which the pre-characterizing
portion of claim 1 has been drafted.Particularly, in this last patent a solution is described wherein
an little steering wheel external with respect to the steering wheel is
provided, said little steering wheel acting on a star shaped element
mounted on a collar element rotating and translating togerther with the
little steering wheel, so that the rectilinear motion is transmitted to two
little rods connected with the accelerator.Afterwards, it has been filed by Mr. Gianini Bruno the patent
application N° 19244A/83, converted on the basis of a definitive decision
issued by the Milan Civil Court into Utility Model, wherein it is described a
structure having substantially the same features of the above mentioned
device, and wherein the motion transmission to the accelerator is
obtained by two little rods pushed by a ring connected to the little steering
wheel.The Applicant has now thought and realized a new solution the
main object of which is to provide a structure remarkably simpler and
more fittable to the vehicles that are manufactured, concerning the
manual acceleration solution.In fact, the solution that is proposed according to the present
invention can be used with any kind of transmission of the motion to the
accelerator pedal according to the known techniques, e.g. a linear
potentiometer, a hydraulic or mechanic transmission system, etc.Furthermore, the structure according to the present invention
can be adopted with the air-bag, as it now occurs in many vehicle of a
certain level. Moreover, the structure according to the invention can be made
completely collapsible, as it is provided by the safety rules in force in this
field in the most developed Countries.It is therefore specific object of the present invention a structure
for the manual acceleration in a vehicle, comprising a steering wheel,
having at a first side faced toward the driver a manual acceleration
