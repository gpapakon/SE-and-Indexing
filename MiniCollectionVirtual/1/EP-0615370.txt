<ABSTRACT>
System for communicating with a network (RE) comprising a computer (HOST) associated, by means of a bus (PSB), with a communications processor (NCC), itself linked to the special-purpose link of the network, the computer including a first operating system (SE1), and the processor including a second operating system (GPOS), organising transmission of the data from the bus to the network and reciprocally, characterised in that it comprises: - a telecommunications server (NCCD), associated with the first operating system, - a communications code (CC) belonging to at least one open-systems interconnection model, associated with the second operating system, the server supplying the first operating system with the means of access (TPAM, IS1, IS2) to the various layers of the code (CC), the latter implementing the specific protocols of each layer, so as to carry out transmission to the host or to the network. Application to telecommunications systems.

Communication system (SCI) with a network (RE)
comprising a computer (HOST) associated by means of a

bus (PSB) with a communication processor (NCC) itself
connected to a specific link of the network, the

computer comprising on the one hand a first operating
system (SE
1
) associated with a plurality of applications
(A
i
, B
i
) exchanging data with the terminals connected to
the network and, on the other hand, a first input-output

manager (GES
1
) organising, over the bus, the
transfer of data to a second input/output manager (GES
2
)
of the processor (NCC), which comprises a second

operating system (GPOS), organising the work of the
processor in order to transmit the data from the bus to

the network and vice versa,

characterised in that it comprises:

a telecommunication server (NCCD) associated with
the first operating system (SE
1
), including the
first input/output manager,
a communication code (CC) belonging to a first and
a second model of open system interconnection, of

the type OSI and TCP/IP respectively, associated
with the second operating system,

the server supplying to the first operating system the
means of access (TPAM, IS
1
, IS
2
) to the various layers
(C
2
 to C
4
) of the code (CC), the latter implementing,
for each of the layers composing it, the specific

protocols of the latter in order to ensure transmission
to the computer (host) or to the network.
Communication system according to Claim 1 characterised
in that the communication server (NCCD) comprises:


a first and a second interface (IS
1
, IS
2
) supplying
respectively the transport service to a first and

second set of sessions (S
1
, S
2
) each belonging
respectively to the first and second model of open 

system interconnection (OSI, TCP-IP), each session
of a set (S
1
, S
2
) corresponding to one of said
applications (A
i
, B
i
),
a module (TPAM) supporting the transport protocol
between the computer and the processor,
an input/output manager (GES
1
) associated with a
physical interface (IP
1
) specific to the bus
(PSB), controlled by said module.
Communication system according to Claim 2,
characterised in that the communication processor (NCC)

comprises:

a physical interface with the bus (IP
2
)
corresponding to the physical interface (IP
1
)
belonging to the telecommunication server (NCCD),
an input/output manager (GES
2
) corresponding to
the input/output manager of the communication

server,

the whole of the two layers constituted by the physical
interface and the input/output manager (GES
1
-IP
1
, GES
2
-IP
2
)
constituting the PLANET protocol,


the communication code (CC) being composed of the
communication layers C
4
 to C
2
, that is, the
transport, network and data-link layers,
an interface (HI) ensuring the dialogue between
the different layers C
4
 of the communication code
and one or other of the session interfaces (IS
1
)
belonging to the telecommunication server (NCCD)

and ensuring the transport service between the
communication code and one or other of the sets of

sessions (S
1
, S
2
)
means for connecting the processor (NCC) to the
network (RE).
Communication system according to Claim 3 characterised
in that the communication code (CC) is supported by a

third operating system (SE
2
) which is of the type CNS-A1, 
and comprises two communication modules (MOSI,

MTCP) concerning respectively the portion of the
communication code implementing the layers C
4
 and C
3
 of
the reference models OSI, TCP-IP, the communication

layer C
2
 being common to the two aforementioned
reference models.
