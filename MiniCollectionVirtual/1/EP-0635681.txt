<ABSTRACT>
An annular combustor system (10) is disclosed in use with a 
radial turbine-type gas turbine engine module (12), the system 

(10) having an annular housing (40) defining a single stage 
combustor, an external fuel/air premixer system (60) having a 

mixing chamber (68) and a compressed air valve (90) and a fuel 
valve (92) both under the control of a controller (94), to 

provide a preselected lean fuel/air ratio mixture for 
introduction to the combustion zone (54) of the annular housing 

(40). Compressed air conduits (80) are used to channel a 
portion of the total compressed air flow to the premixer (60) 

and the remainder to the dilution zone (56) of the combustor 
(10), and a fuel conduit (66) is used to deliver all of the 

fuel to the premixer (60). Convection cooling of the annular 
housing (40) is accomplished using compressed air without 

diluting the fuel air ratio in the combustion zone (54). The 
premixer (60) includes a venturi (68), a fuel nozzle (64) for 

spraying fuel into the venturi inlet (70) along the venturi 
axis (74), and a premixer housing (62) integrating the 

compressed air valve (90), the venturi axis (74) being aligned 
substantially tangentially to the annular housing axis (42) to 

provide a swirling admission of the premixed fuel/air mixture 
to the combustion zone (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combustion system for gas
turbine engines or other heat devices, which will produce
very little oxides of nitrogen or carbon monoxide.
Specifically, the present invention relates to a system,
process, and apparatus for combusting fuel in a gas turbine
engine module which dramatically lowers NOx and CO levels by
providing a nearly constant fuel/air ratio in the combustion
zone at all engine operating conditions in addition to
thoroughly pre-mixing the fuel and air prior to combustion
and, if necessary, completely vaporizing a liquid fuel.Although gas turbine engines do not produce the majority
of the nitrogen oxide emissions released into the earth's
atmosphere, reducing those emissions will reduce the total
and, in that regard, many countries have enacted laws
limiting the amounts that may be released. The reaction of
nitrogen and oxygen in the air to form nitrogen oxides, like
almost all chemical reactions, proceeds faster at higher
temperatures. One way to limit the amount of NOx formed is
to limit the temperature of the reaction. The NOx produced
in gas turbine engines is produced in the combustion process
where the highest temperature in the cycle normally exists.
Therefore, one way to limit the amount of NOx produced is to
limit the combustion temperature. Various attempts have been made to limit the combustion
temperature and thereby NOx production in both "single stage"
combustors (i.e., those having only a single combustion zone
where fuel and air are introduced) and "multistage"
combustors, including pilot burners where several, serial
connected combustion zones having separate fuel and air
introduction means are used. U.S. Patent No. 4,994,149, U.S.
Patent No. 4,297,842, and U.S. Patent No. 4,255,927 disclose
single stage gas turbine combustors where the flow of
compressed air to the combustion zone and the dilution zone
of an annular combustor are controlled to decrease the
concentration of NOx in the turbine exhaust gases. In the
above combustors, essentially unmixed fuel and air are
separately admitted to the combustor, with mixing and
combustion consequently occurring within the same chamber.
See also Japanese Laid-Open No. 55-45739. U.S. Patent No.
5,069,029, U.S. Patent No. 4,898,001, U.S. Patent No.
4,829,764, and U.S. Patent No. 4,766,721 disclose two stage
combustors. See also German Gebrauchsmuster, 99215856.0.
Again, however, fuel and air are provided to each stage at
least partially unmixed with complete mixing occurring within
the respective combustion
