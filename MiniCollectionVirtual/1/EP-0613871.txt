<ABSTRACT>
A composting chamber 1 for biologically decomposable kitchen, domestic and garden waste is proposed, which consists of a lower container part 2 which can be dug into the inhabited soil and of an upper container part 3 which projects above the surface level of the earth, the upper container part 3 being mounted detachably on the lower container part 2 and having at the top a filling opening which can be closed by a removable cover 25 or the like, while the lower container part 2 is provided at least in regions with openings 8 towards the surrounding earth for small living beings, moisture and air. For the purpose of improving the mode of action of the composting chamber 1, the lower container part 2 has a closed bottom 5 and its casing 6 is provided with openings 8 only at a minimum distance 7 above this bottom 5. An additional container or basket 4, which has a permeable bottom 13 and a likewise permeable casing region 16, is to be inserted into the lower container part 2. The additional container or basket 4 can be placed at least partly with its permeable casing region 16 against the permeable casing region 8 of the lower container part 2 and the region of the lower container part 2 close to the bottom forms a tank 9 for collecting and/or storing liquid.
