<ABSTRACT>
A hedge trimmer blade assembly preferably a double acting 
assembly having upper and lower reciprocating blades (27,28). 

Superimposed 
cutting teeth (29,30) extend laterally from the sides of the 

assembly from 
each of the blades. Guard portions (32) extend from the teeth of the 

upper blade (27) only on one side and from the teeth of the lower 
blade (28) 

only on the other side. The guard portions are asymmetrical with 
a straight side (38) and a tapered side (34,36), the taper 

preferably including 
a shallow bevel (34) near the base and a sharper bevel (36) near 

the tip (40) of 
the guard portion. The cutting teeth (29,30) of both upper and lower 

blades (27,28) on both sides form oval shaped cutting chambers (48) with 
cooperative hook configurations at the entry to the cutting 

chambers. The upper and lower blades (27,28) are preferably identical in 
configuration but inverted one relative to the other in the 

assembly. The straight sides (38) of the guard portions are all faced 
toward the power head of the trimmer to produce a hooking action as 

the user sweeps the trimmer during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hedge trimmers and more 
specifically to blade assemblies for hedge trimmers, the 
blades having cooperating teeth. Hedges as contemplated for trimming with the present 
tool, typically consist of vegetation with stem diameters 
ranging from the very slim or fine stems to stems having 
diameters approaching three-quarters of an inch. A trimmer 
having double acting blades operates with a scissors-like 
action in which the cutting edges of sharpened teeth 
projecting laterally from a pair of cutting blades move back 
and forth in opposite directions. The opposing 
reciprocation of the cutting teeth causes the teeth to first 
move apart to create an opening between the teeth in which 
the hedge materials enter and then they move together to 
sever those materials. Hereafter the openings between the 
cutting teeth are referred to as cutting chambers. The cutting chamber has an opening that allows entry of 
materials, and a hood shape is provided at the entry to the 
cutting chamber to grab and draw the hedge material into the 
opening. A guard portion extends outwardly of the cutting 
teeth of one of the blades, i.e., the guard portion protrudes 
beyond the cutting edge. The adjacent guard portions in 
response to an established safety regulation, cooperate to 
prevent entry of a circular stem having a 1.95 cm. (3/4 inch) 
diameter, that is, no portion of the 1.95 cm. stem is allowed 
to enter the cutting chamber. Thus, the guard portions are 
configured to have inwardly directed abutments spaced 
outwardly from the cutting chamber entry and forming a gate 
or throat through which the hedge materials must pass in 
order to enter the cutting chamber. A 1.95 cm. diameter stem 
will engage the abutments and thereby be prevented from 
entering the cutting chamber, so that the reciprocating 
cutting edges will not cut into the stem.  The above requirements for the guard portion generates 
several problems. The guard portion's outer tip cannot be 
allowed to have a broad edge that engages the hedge material. 
If the tip is broad, the hedge material is simply pushed away 
from and under the blade assembly and doesn't get cut. Thus, 
the guard portion is formed like an arrowhead, with the base 
of the head defined by the hook shaped entry into the cutting 
chamber, and with the sides angled inwardly first to the 
point of abutment (where the 1.95 cm. stem is rejected) and 
then to a narrow landing. Whereas the safety regulation, 
hook shaped grabbing, and narrow tip features are

<CLAIMS>
A hedge trimmer blade assembly comprising: 
   elongate upper and lower blades (27,28) each having 

opposed sides, the blades being connected together in 
superimposed relationship for relative lengthwise axial 

reciprocation, cutting teeth (29,30) laterally projecting 
from the same side of both the upper and the lower blades 

with the cutting teeth of the upper blade overlying the 
cutting teeth of the lower blade, the cutting teeth having 

cutting edges that define cutting chambers (48) and entries 
(46) into the cutting chambers, and the teeth (30) of one of 

the blades only having guard portions (32) laterally extended 
beyond the cutting chamber, adjacent guard portions 

cooperatively defining a restrictive throat leading to the 
cutting chamber entry, and each guard portion extending from 

a base at the cutting chamber entry to a tip at its extreme 
outer end, characterised in that each guard portion has a 

non-symmetrical configuration with one side (38) extending 
substantially perpendicular to the axial length of the 

assembly and the opposite side (34,36) tapered from the base 
to the tip, the throat between adjacent guard portions being 

formed by the straight side (38) of one guard portion and the 
tapered side (34,36) of the other guard portion and 

functioning to prevent oversize stems from entering the 
cutting chamber (48). 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the tapered side of each guard portion (32) has the 

form of a double bevel (34,36) to form a throat configured 
with a sharp angle starting at the tip and converting to a 

shallow angle into the cutting chamber entry (46). 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the tapered side of each guard portion (32) has a 

curved form. 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in claim 
 

1, 2 or 3 wherein the tapered side of each guard portion 
forms a narrow landing (40) at the tip of the guard portion. 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in claim 
1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein the cutting edges (68) of both the upper 

and the lower teeth (29,30) are concavely curved and define 
oval shaped cutting chambers (48), each cutting edge of 

adjacent teeth of both the upper and lower blades (27,28) 
thereby having a hook shape at the outer edge thereof that 

defines the cutting chamber entry (46) and cooperatively 
provides a hooking action to draw hedge material into the 

cutting chamber. 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the cutting teeth (29,30) extend 

laterally from both sides of both upper and lower blades 
(27,28) the guard portions (32) are provided on the teeth of 

the upper blade extended from one side and from the teeth of 
the lower blade extended from the opposite side, and the 

upper and lower blades have substantially similar overall 
configurations with one blade inverted relative to the other 

blade whereby both blades can be blanked and formed in a 
similar manufacturing operation. 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in any 
preceding claim arranged for one end thereof to be mounted to 

a power head of a hedge trimmer arranged for trimming in a 
sweeping action such that the opposite end of the assembly is 

moved in an arc (70), the guard portions (32) being arranged 
on the cutting teeth so that all the throats have the 

straight sides (38) thereof facing toward the power head end 
to provide a hooking as opposed to camming action of hedge 

materials engaged thereby. 
A hedge trimmer blade assembly as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the cutting blades (27,28) are 

captured between upper and lower mounting bars (52,50), both 
of the cutting blades being mounted to the mounting bars to 

 
be reciprocally moved relative to each other to provide a 

double acting trimmer blade assembly.
