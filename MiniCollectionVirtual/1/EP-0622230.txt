<ABSTRACT>
In bidirectional(63)printing(32), ink-drop 
time-of-flight effects undesirably operate in opposite senses 

(V
c
F, V
c
R), during operation in the two different printing 
directions (63
F
, 63
B
), respectively, to offset the actually 
printed ink position (34, 34'), 
in opposite directions
 (ΔX
F
, 
ΔX
R
), from any nominal ink-firing point (14a, 25b). When a 
common firing point (14a, 18a) is used for marks (34,35) that 

should be aligned, during bidirectional scanning, the two 
resulting sets (34,35) of image features are misaligned. To 

compensate for this adverse phenomenon, the firing points (14-a, 
25b), in the two directions (63
F
, 63
B
) respectively, are 
made to bracket each common, desired mark location (34, 34'); 

the bidirectionally flying drops (32, 32'') thus "lead" or 
approach each desired common mark location (34, 34') from 

opposite directions and can be made to align precisely. This 
can be done by addressing each position based on an 

earlier-arriving encoder-signal pulse (21b) and passing the 
signal through a delay line (81) -- during pen movement in 

just one (63
B
) of the two directions. A related approach is to 
use a subpixel spacing feature generally provided in the 

pen-positioning system, to back the firing position off in for 
example units of about 1/24 millimeter (1/600 inch)
 -- but 
during scanning in only one (63
B
) of two directions -- to 
roughly align the marks (34, 34'). The asymmetrical 

earlier-pulse selection (or "backing off") and delay improve 
alignment. Another technique is useful for certain situations 

in which the printer uses large amounts of ink -- relative to 
the amount of liquid that can be absorbed by or evaporated 

from the printing medium that is in use -- for example, when 
doing double-ink-drop printing on transparency stock. An 

unesthetic mottling effect arises in such situations. It has 
been discovered that, in this case, print quality is improved 

by purposely choosing relatively large jitter or random 
variation (t₄-t₁, t₄'-t₁') in firing time in each pixel column.

<DESCRIPTION>
Coowned U. S. Patent 4,789,874 of Majette et al., 
issued December 6, 1988, sets forth a representative 
interpolation (or, as it is sometimes designated, "extrapolation") 
system that is particularly useful in the practice 
of certain aspects of the present invention. That 
patent is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety 
into this document. This invention relates generally to machines and 
procedures for printing text or graphics on printing media 
such as paper, transparency stock, or other glossy media; 
and more particularly to such a machine and method that 
constructs text or images from individual marks created on 
the printing medium, in a two-dimensional pixel array, by 
a pen or other marking element or head that scans across 
the medium bidirectionally. The invention is particularly beneficial in printers 
that operate by the thermal-inkjet process -- which discharges 
individual ink drops onto the printing medium. As 
will be seen, however, certain features of the invention 
are applicable to other scanning-head printing processes 
as well. Bidirectional operation of any scanning-head device 
is advantageous in that no time is wasted in slewing or 
returning the print head across the medium to a starting 
position after each scan; however, bidirectional operation 
does present some obstacles to precise positioning of the  
 
printed marks, and also to best image quality. In order 
to describe these obstacles it will be helpful first to 
set forth some of the context in which these systems 
operate. In many printing devices, position information is 
derived by automatic reading of graduations along a scale 
or so-called "encoder strip" (or sometimes "codestrip") 
that is extended across the medium. The graduations 
typically are in the form of opaque lines marked on a 
transparent plastic or glass strip, or in the form of 
solid opaque bars separated by apertures formed through a 
metal strip. Such graduations typically are sensed electrooptically 
to generate an electrical waveform that may be characterized 
as a square wave, or more rigorously a trapezoidal 
wave. Electronic circuitry responds to each pulse in the 
wavetrain, signalling the pen-drive (or other marking-head-drive) 
mechanism at each pixel location -- that is, 
each point where ink can be discharged to form a properly 
located picture element as part of the desired image. These data are compared, or combined, with information 
about the desired image -- triggering the pen or 
other marking head to produce a mark
