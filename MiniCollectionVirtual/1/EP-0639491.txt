<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steering device for track laying gear with hydrostatic drive, consisting of planet wheel differentials which are coupled to one another kinematically. In order to be able to use different, existing transmission arrangements for wheel running gear of vehicles and automotive vehicles without a large degree of reequipment complexity, even for track laying running gear, the differential devices assigned to the drive wheels of the track are arranged in separate transmission housings 2; 3 and, in order to be positioned as a function of the respective constructional spaces and installation conditions, are attached to an existing gearbox housing 1 so as to be detachable and adjustable by an angle, while service brakes 21 which interact with the spider shafts 13 for the drive wheels of the track are provided on the outsides of the gearbox housings 2; 3.

A steering device for a track laying running gear 
including static displacement drive means, comprising 

differential means in the form of planetary gear units (13; 
15; 16; 22), each associated with the driving wheels of the 

track laying running gear, the ring gears (15) of the two 
planetary gear units being fixedly connected to the output 

shaft (23) of the shift transmission gear (1) of the vehicle 
drive (4), and the carrier shafts (13) of the planet wheels 

(22) being fixedly connected to one of the driving shafts of 
the driving wheels of the crawler track, with the sun gears 

(16) being kinematically coupled to each other through a 
compensating member (6; 17; 18, 19), characterized in that the 

planetary gear type differentials are arranged in separate 
transmission gear cases (2; 3) detachably fixed to the gear 

case of the shift transmission gear (1) to be pivotable by an 
adjustable angle Î±, and brakes (21) acting on the carrier 

shafts are provided on the outside surfaces of the 
transmission gear case, with the output shaft (14) of a 

steering gear being supported at least by one of the 
transmission gear cases (2; 3) and rotatably connected, 

through spur gears (19; 20), to the sun gear (16) and a shaft 
(6) constituting the kinematic coupling between the planetary 

gear type differentials, and the shaft (6) of the kinematic 
coupling being rotatably connected, through the spur gear (18) 

and an intermediate gear, to the sun gear (16) in the 
transmission gear case (2). 
A steering device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that a dustproof cover associated with the 

shaft (6) is provided between, and detachably fixed to, the 
transmission gear cases (2; 3). 
A steering device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that the cover is composed of tubular 

elements mating in a telescopic manner and longitudinally  
 

adjustable, between which a seal (9) is provided and which 
are, at the ends thereof, provided with a mounting flange. 
A steering device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the steering gear is a hydraulic motor 

which is directly attached to the transmission gear case (3).
