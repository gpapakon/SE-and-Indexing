<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed cover comprises a substantially cylindrical hollow 
body (2), an elastic compensating membrane (3) and a compensating 

spring (16). The hollow body (2) has at one of its ends (
C
) an inlet 
to which is coupled the functional extremity (5) of a hydraulic cylinder 

(
C
), and at the other end a closure face (10). The membrane (3) has a 
retaining extension (9) for its secured positioning and prevents the liquid 

(
F
) contained in the cylinder (
C
) to leak to the outside. The helical 
spring (16) actuates permanently in a compression mode and one 

of its ends bears against the inside of the closure face (10) while its 
other end bears against the internal face (9) of the membrane (3). The 

membrane (3) and the hollow body (2) define a compensation chamber 
(15) whose volume (
VC
) varies as a function of the pressure exerted by the fluid (
F
) on the external face (8) of the membrane 
(3). Application to the motor vehicle industry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydraulic pressurised piston-cylinder 
device having an internal volume variation compensating 
device. This invention has been developed within a research programme 
of wider general scope relating to the manufacture 
of hydraulic self-regulating devices for regulating, by 
way of permanent adjustment, the length of the cable, or 
linking member, connecting a mechanism with the corresponding 
control member. An example of such self-regulating 
devices are the devices for regulating the length of 
the control cable linking the clutch mechanism with the 
clutch pedal. The purpose of this regulation of the control 
cable length is to compensate for the wear of the 
clutch plate lining during use. A known embodiment of the hydraulic self-regulating devices 
for the clutch control cable length is disclosed in 
Spanish patent P 9002014 (equivalent to EP-A-0 494 276) 
which describes a device which, in essence, comprises a 
main body member, or cylinder, housing therein a piston 
which comprises a check valve, a regulating rod which is 
connected at one end thereof to the said piston and at 
the other end, which extends out from the main body member, 
it is connected to the control cable linking it with 
the clutch pedal and a liquid completely filling the interior 
space of the cylinder. Among its many possible  
 
applications, the device according to Spanish patent P 
9002014 (equivalent to EP-A-0 494 276) has proved to be 
highly efficient when used in the regulation of the 
length of the control cable extending from the clutch 
pedal to the pressure plate fork of the clutch mechanism, 
by automatically varying the length of the portion of the 
regulating rod housed within the cylinder appropriately 
to compensate for the wear of the clutch. In other words, 
the length of the outwardly extending portion of the rod 
increases, which is equivalent to increasing the operative 
length of the control cable, whereby, whenever there 
is a physically noticeable wear, the length of the cable 
increases, adjusting itself to the new situation arising 
from such wear. The self-regulating device according to Spanish patent P 
9002014 (equilvalent to EP-A- 0 494 276) is provided with 
volumetric compensation means designed permanently and 
automatically to absorb the variations of volume affecting 
both the cylinder and the liquid contained therein 
owing to changes in the ambient temperature of the place 
where the device is installed. The compensation means are 
also designed to absorb the
