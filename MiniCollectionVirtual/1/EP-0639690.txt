<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, a double wall pipe for propulsion, which is constructed such that an inner 
pipe and an outer pipe are relatively movable with each other in the longitudinal direction, is provided and a propulsive 

force is acted only on the outer pipe. With this arrangement, this double wall pipe for propulsion can be laid under 
the ground without damaging the rear end surface of the inner pipe and without generating an internal stress in the 

inner pipe, thereby achieving the laying being high in the reliability, in which pinholes, cracks and the like can be 
prevented from occurring in the inner pipe during the use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a double walled 
pipe, for example, a gas pipe or the like, having a double 
walled pipe structure, which is suitable for a jacking method 
in which an object is propelled under the ground to be buried 
underground, and a jacking method thereof, and further to a 
pipe end structure of a leading pipe which is used for 
leading the double walled pipe when it is propelled 
underground. It happens that as a pipe which is buried underground 
for transporting, for example, the high pressure gas, a 
double walled steel pipe is used. In such a double walled 
steel pipe, there is slushed the concrete or the like the 
space between the inner pipe and the outer pipe to maintain 
the strength of the pipe. Further, to bury such a double 
walled steel pipe under the ground, there may be adopted a 
so-called jacking method. According to the jacking method,  
 
burying of the double walled steel pipe is conducted in such 
a manner that a predetermined shaft is beforehand dug to 
propel the double steel pipe from the side wall of the shaft 
in the longitudinal direction, but not to bury the double 
walled steel pipe from the ground through open-cut of an 
elongated groove extended along the burying path. Figs. 35(A) and 35(B) are a side elevation and a 
section view, respectively, showing by way of example the 
conventional double walled steel pipe which will be used in 
adoption of the jacking method as described above. Referring to Figs. 35(A) and 35(B), a double walled 
steel pipe 31 basically comprises an inner pipe 33, an outer 
pipe 35 and a concrete 37 which fills up the space between 
the inner pipe 33 and the outer pipe 35. Where a front end 
portion 33a and a back end portion 33b of the inner pipe 33 
are not covered by the concrete 37 and thus exposed. There are prepared a plurality of pieces of such 
double walled steel pipe 31, and those are propelled 
underground in a direction as shown by the arrow in the 
figure. At that time, burying of those pipes is implemented 
in the following manner. A back end plane 33d of the 
preceding double walled steel pipe 31 and a front end plane 
33c of the subsequent double walled steel pipe 31 are coupled 
to each other and welded, and then the welded portion is  
 
fitted with one having a ring configuration in which a ring 
is segmented into a plurality of pieces, a back end plane 35b 
of the outer pipe 35 of the preceding double walled steel 
pipe 31 and a front end plane 35a of the outer pipe 35 of the 
subsequent double walled steel
