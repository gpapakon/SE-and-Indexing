<ABSTRACT>
A reversible blind having slats (2, 2a) which may be 
rolled up on a drum; guides (12) for conventional unrolling 

of the blind and guides (14) for reversed unrolling; a tile 
(32) which may rotate and is fixedly attached to fixing 

discs (34); a clutch associating the tile (32) with the drum 
(6). In one position of the clutch, the tile (32) and drum 

(6) rotate and the slats are rolled up; in another position, 
the tile (32) is locked at the top and the blind moves from 

the guides (12) to the guides (14), being reversed. The 
clutch comprises: a ring member (38) attached to the drum (6) 

and having axial bores (40); axial orifices (42) of the 
fixing disc (34) which may be aligned with the bores (40); a 

free disc (44) having an eye (46) and axial pins (48) passing 
through the orifices (42) and insertable in the bores (40); 

and a pin (50). Alternatively, the pins (48) are out of or in 
the bores (40) and the pin (50) is engaged in or disengaged 

from the eye (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reversible blind comprising: 
a series of hingedly connected slats; a roll-up drum mounted 
on a shaft for rotation and having slat pulling means; drive 
means for said drum; a first pair of guides for receiving the 
side edges of the slats, in a conventional rolled-down position 
thereof and a second pair of guides for receiving the 
same edges in a reversed rolled-down position thereof; a 
rotatable arcuate shell-like casing coaxial with at least the 
end portions of said drum; two fixing discs fixedly attached 
peripherally to said shell-like casing; a clutch device 
adapted to associate said casing to said drum; spring means 
urging said device; and locking means for said casing. As is well known, blinds have one side which, in the 
rolled-down position thereof, is on the inside of the opening 
receiving the blind, whereby it is perfectly accessible 
to the user and is easy to clean. On the contrary, the 
opposite side is either rolled up or is on the outside of 
the opening in which the blind is located. Therefore, when 
this opening is not accessible from the outside (as is the 
different cases of a balcony, terrace or like construction), 
this opposite side may not be cleaned by the user, unless 
costly and/or hazardous positions are adopted, either by 
hanging down from higher levels or climbing up from lower 
levels. Several solutions have been proposed for this problem, 
such as the fixing of brushes whose bristles engage the 
unaccessible side during the rolling-up and rolling-down 
movements of the blind. In Spanish patent application nÂº 9100911, which gave 
priority to EP-A-0 508 931, there is disclosed a blind roll-up 
system in which, at the user's will, the blind is 
alternatively operated between a conventional rolled-down 
position and a rolled-up position; or between the conventional 
rolled-down position and a reverse rolled-down position. 
In the latter, the opposite side of the blind, normally  
 
inaccessible, is exposed towards the interior of the 
opening; obviously, a second pair of guides are provided for 
the said reverse rolled-down position. Nevertheless, the blind referred to in the foregoing 
paragraph has certain minor drawbacks, some of which relate 
to the space, at times excessive, required for installing 
the roll-up drum, the clutch device and the drive means. It is an object of the invention to overcome these drawbacks, 
particularly those related to this device. This 
object is attained with a blind of the type first mentioned 
above

<CLAIMS>
1.- A reversible blind comprising: a series of hingedly 
connected slats (2, 2a); a roll-up drum (6) mounted on a 

shaft for rotation and having slat (2, 2a) pulling means; 
drive means for said drum (6); a first pair of guides (12) 

for receiving the side edges of the slats (2, 2a), in a 
conventional rolled-down position thereof and a second pair 

of guides (14) for receiving the same edges in a reversed 
rolled-down position thereof; a rotatable arcuate shell-like 

casing (32) coaxial with at least the end portions of 
said drum (6); two fixing discs (34) fixedly attached peripherally 

to said shell-like casing (32); a clutch device 
adapted to associate said casing (32) to said drum (6); 

spring means (52) urging said device; and locking means for 
said casing, characterized in that said clutch device comprises: 

a ring member (38) fixedly attached to said drum 
(6), situated at one end thereof and provided with axially 

extending bores (40); axially extending orifices (42) formed 
in said fixing disc (34) and which are adapted to be aligned 

with said bores (40); a free disc (44), coaxial with said 
drum (6), provided with an eye (46) and axially extending 

pins (48) passing through said orifices (42) and adapted to 
be inserted in said bores (40); and an operative means, 

provided with a locking pin (50) and adapted to move said 
free disc (44) axially between a first position in which said 

pins (48) are inserted in said bores (40) and said locking 
pin (50) is not engaged with said eye (46), and a second 

position in which said pins (48) are not in said bores (40) 
and said locking pin (50) is in said eye (46).
