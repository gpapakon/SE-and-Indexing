<ABSTRACT>
Images are printed using marks formed in pixel arrays 
by a scanning print head. 

Certain special techniques well-suited for plain-paper printing 
have been found undesirable for use with plastic media; 

these techniques include so-called "resolution-enhanced 
technology", bidirectional printing (particularly of 

black), and optical-density controlled printing speed. At 
top and bottom of each page or sheet of printing medium, 

where it is undesirable to operate with the pen partly off 

the edge of the sheet, and where also the printing medium 
is constrained from only one direction rather than being 

held taut beneath the pen, the print mask is rotated while 
the printing medium is held stationary -- thereby entirely 

avoiding reliance upon accuracy of print-medium advance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to machines and
procedures for printing text or graphics on printing media
such as paper, transparency stock, or other glossy media; 
and more particularly to a scanning thermal-inkjet machine
and method that construct text or images from individual
ink spots created on a printing medium, in a two-dimensional
pixel array. The invention employs print-mode
techniques to optimize image quality (primarily on transparent
and glossy media) vs. operating time, and also to
minimize image distortion (primarily on paper) imposed by
an ink-drying heater.To achieve vivid colors in inkjet printing with
aqueous inks, and to substantially fill the white space
between addressable pixel locations, ample quantities of
ink must be deposited. Doing so, however, requires subsequent
removal of the water base -- by evaporation (and,
for some printing media, absorption) -- and this drying
step can be unduly time consuming.In addition, if a large amount of ink is put down all
at substantially the same time, within each section of an
image, related adverse bulk-colorant effects arise: so-called
"bleed" of one color into another (particularly
noticeable at color boundaries that should be sharp),
"blocking" or offset of colorant in one printed image onto
the back of an adjacent sheet with consequent sticking of
the two sheets together (or of one sheet to pieces of the
apparatus or to slipcovers used to protect the imaged
sheet), and "cockle" or puckering of the printing medium.
Various techniques are known for use together to moderate
these adverse drying-time effects and bulk- or gross-colorant
effects.Among these
techniques is heating the inked medium to accelerate
evaporation of the water base or carrier. Heating, however,
has limitations of its own; and in turn creates other 
difficulties due to heat-induced deformation of the printing
medium.Glossy stock warps severely in response to heat, and
transparencies too can tolerate somewhat less heating than
ordinary paper. Accordingly, heating has provided only
limited improvement of drying characteristics for these
plastic media.As to paper, the application of heat and ink causes
dimensional changes that affect the quality of the image
or graphic. Specifically, it has been found preferable to
precondition the paper by application of heat before
contact of the ink; if preheating is not provided, so-called
"end-of-page handoff" quality defects occur -- this
defect takes the form of a straight image-discontinuity
band formed across the bottom of each

A method of printing desired images on a low-liquid-absorption
printing medium (33), by construction from individual

marks formed in pixel column-and-row arrays by a scanning

multiple-nozzle pen (31) that operates in conjunction with
a printing-medium advance mechanism (78), said method comprising

the steps of:

scanning the pen (31) repeatedly along a pen-scanning axis
across the medium (33), to place marks on the medium (33) within a

swath of pixel rows that is exposed to the multiple nozzles
of the pen (31), each nozzle corresponding to one pixel

row, wherein the total number of scans at each pixel row is exactly six;
periodically advancing the printing medium (33) relative
to the pen (31), along a printing-medium-advance axis that is

substantially orthogonal to the pen-scanning axis, to
bring a fresh portion of the medium (33) within the swath that

is exposed to the pen (31); and
in each scanning of the pen (31) across the medium (33),

column and thereby depositing, over the total

ink in each pixel position that is inked.

medium (33) by a number of pixel rows equal to substantially

one-sixth of the number of operating nozzles of the pen (31),

The method of claim 1, wherein:

the medium-advancing step comprises advancing the
