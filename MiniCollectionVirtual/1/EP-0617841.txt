A method of making semiconductor components, the method
being characterized by the following steps:


a) producing a semi-insulating or n-type substrate (1);
b) forming a separating layer (2) of a p
+
-type doped material on the
surface of said substrate;
c) forming an active layer (3) on said separating layer, the active
layer including at least a bottom layer with n-type doping;
d) making a set of semiconductor components (5) by etching and
metallizing said active layer, regions (7) of the separating layer

being bared by said etching between said components or groups of
said components;
g) fixing a common support plate (8) on the assembly made in this
way, thereby covering and holding the components together

mechanically; and
h) dissolving the material of the separating layer anodically and
without illumination while leaving the other materials intact, said

separating layer being attacked in the area of said bared regions,
and accordingly separating the substrate from said components

without dissolving the substrate, a rear face of said active layer (3)
of the components or groups of components being thus uncovered.
The method of claim 1 in which, said active layer also including
at least one p-type doped layer, further steps are provided between

steps d) and g) consisting in:

e) covering the set of components and the bared regions with a
protective layer (6) of a passivation material or of a photosensitive

resin; and
f) selectively etching said protective layer so as to bare the
separating layer in the area of said regions between the

components or groups of said components.
The method of claim 1 or 2, further including a step consisting
in: 


i) depositing a metallization (9) on said rear face of the active layer of
the components or groups of components uncovered by the

separation of the substrate at step h).
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, further including the
step consisting in:


k) separating the various individual components or groups of
components from said common support plate.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 4, further including a step
consisting in:


j) fixing the various individual components or groups of components
via their rear faces onto a common support member (10).
The method of claim 5, in which said common support member
carry component interconnection lines.
The method of any one of claims 5 or 6, in which said common
support member is optically transparent, and the components are

optoelectronic components.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 7, in which said common
support plate carry component interconnection lines.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 8, in which said common
support plate is optically transparent, and the components are

optoelectronic components.
