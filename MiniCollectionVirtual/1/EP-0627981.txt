<DESCRIPTION>
 HEAT RECOVERABLE TUBULAR ARTICLEBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to a heat recoverable tubular article which when heated recovers to or toward a specified angle with respect to the axis of the tube and to a method of preparing said article. It further relates to a method of bending an elongate substrate by positioning such a tubular article over the substrate and heating to cause recovery of the article thereby bending the substrate and to the resulting bent substrate.Wiring and plumbing systems require wires or tubing to be bent at specific angles in specific locations relative to interconnection and "feed-through" points. Common methods of accommodating bends while providing mechanical, electrical, and environmental protection include elastomeric molded parts and heat-shrinkable molded parts.Elastomeric parts require specialized tooling to fabricate and install, and they are difficult to incorporate in automatic assembly processes. When elastomeric parts are used a part of a connector or conduit assembly, they impart a "rubbery" feel to the connectors, making it difficult to assure the connectors are properly mated. Environmental sealing quality is limited with the "interference fit" method of displacing elastomeric parts. A substrate can be bent using elastomeric "elbow" parts by forcing the substrate through the part or by inserting a straight expandable tool into the part to straighten and enlarge it and then inserting the substrate. Removal of the tool causes the elastomeric elbow to return to its bent shape thus bending the substrate. Angles achieved with elastomeric bending devices are hard to control, as the substrates cause the elastomers to "spring back". Finally, the elastomeric parts are normally "slip fit" to connectors and conduits, and the quality of mechanical fit between the parts provides poor strain relief.Some limitations of elastomeric molded parts can be overcome with heat-shrinkable molded parts, but heat-shrinkable molded parts also have limitations. A heat-shrinkable part is easier 

to install, but it is much more difficult to fabricate. In addition, a conventional heat-shrinkable molded part does not have enough force when it is shrinking to bend wire or tubing substrates.My invention overcomes concerns associated with elastomeric parts while also addressing limitations of conventional heat- shrinkable molded parts.Summary of the InventionOne aspect of this invention comprises a heat recoverable tubular article comprising:(a) . a polymeric sleeve; and(b) a

Claims
1. A heat recoverable tubular article comprising:
(a) a polymeric sleeve; and
(b) a spring having a first configuration in which it is bent at a given angle and a second configuration in which it is substantially straight, said spring being held in said second configuration by said sleeve;
wherein when heat is applied to the article, the polymeric material of the sleeve softens to permit recovery of the spring to its bent configuration thereby bending the sleeve.
2. An article according to claim 1, wherein the sleeve is lined with a thermoplastic material in which the spring is embedded.
3. An article according to claim 2, wherein the thermoplastic material is a hot melt adhesive.
4. An article according to claim 1 wherein the sleeve is made of a heat recoverable polymeric material and shrinks radially when heated.
5. An article according to claim 1, wherein the spring is a helical spring.
6. An article according to claim 1 wherein the spring is made of a metal.
7. An article according to claim 6 wherein the spring is made of spring steel.
8. An article according to claim 6 wherein the spring is made of a nickel titanium shape memory alloy. 


9. A method of forming a bend in an elongate substrate which comprises:
(I) positioning over the substrate a heat recoverable tubular article comprising:
(a) a polymeric sleeve; and
(b) a spring having a first configuration in which it is bent at a specific angle and a second configuration in which it is relatively straight, said spring being held in said second configuration by said sleeve;
and
(II)
'
 heating the article to cause the polymeric material of the sleeve to soften thereby permitting the spring to recover toward its bent configuration which causes the substrate to bend.
10. A method of preparing a heat recoverable article which comprises:
(I) forming and setting a spring in a first configuration in which it is bent as a given angle; Φ
(II) straightening the spring and maintaining the spring in its straightened configuration;
(III) positioning a polymeric sleeve with respect to the spring such that it retains the spring in its straightened configuration.
11. An elongate substrate in which a segment thereof is bent by a heat recovered article comprising a polymeric sleeve and a spring, the spring having bent the substrate to the desired angle. 


12. A heat recoverable tubular article comprising:
(a) a polymeric sleeve; and
(b) a spring having a first configuration in which it is heat stable and bent at a given angle and a second configuration in which it is heat unstable and substantially straight, said spring being in said second configuration until sufficient heat is applied to cause the spring to transform into its first configuration, thereby bending the sleeve.
13. A heat recoverable article in accordance with claim 12 wherein the spring is made of a thermal shape memory alloy.
14. A heat recoverable article in accordance with claim 13, wherein the spring is made of a nickel-titanium alloy.
15. An article according to claim 1 wherein the bent configuration of the sleeve is at an angle of between about 20° to about 120°.
16. An article according to claim 15 wherein the angle is between about 45° to about 100°.
17. A method according to claim 9 wherein the spring is set to maintain the specific angle of the first configuration between about 20° and about 120°.
18. A method according to claim 17 wherein the spring is set to maintain the specific angle between about 45° and about 100°.
