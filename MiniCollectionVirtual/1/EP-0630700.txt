<ABSTRACT>
An upper tool for a press brake includes a push 
actuating section (9K, 107, 9U) for actuating upward an 

actuated member (17, 103P, 121) movable up and down, in a 
clamping force increasing mechanism such that an upper tool 

clamping force can be increased gradually when the actuated 
member (17, 103P, 121) mounted on an upper holder device 

(1) of the press brake is moved upward. An example of the 
push actuating section is a lower surface of an engage 

groove portion (9K) extending horizontally and formed in 
any of front and rear surfaces of the upper tool (9). 

Further, the engage groove portion (9K) is formed between a 
vertical position roughly the same as a holder contact 

surface (9F) formed at a shoulder portion of the upper tool 
(9) and another vertical position slightly lower than an 

upper end of the upper tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an upper tool in combination
with an upper tool holder for a
press brake
according to the preamble of claim 1.As is well known, the structure of a press brake is
such that an upper table (referred to as an upper apron,
sometimes) and a lower table (referred to as a lower apron,
sometimes) are provided so as to be opposed vertically to
each other and further any one of the upper and lower
tables is moved up and down relative to the other as a ram.Further, in the press brake, an upper tool is attached
to the lower portion of the upper table and a lower tool is
attached to the upper portion of the lower table.In the above-mentioned structure, work disposed
between the upper and lower tools can be bent when both the
tools are engaged with each other by moving the movable-side
table up and down.In the above-mentioned press brake, in order to
exchange an upper tool with another upper tool according to
the bending shape of work, a number of upper tool holder
devices are attached to the lower portion of the upper
table, and further a number of tools are removably supported
by a number of the upper tool holder devices, respectively. Here, in the conventional upper tool holder device, an
upper tool clamp is mounted on a holder body attached to the
lower portion of the upper table, and the upper portion of
the upper tool is strongly fastened and fixed between the
holder body and the upper tool clamp when the upper clamp is
fastened with fastening bolts.In the conventional upper tool holder device,
therefore, a great number of fastening bolts arranged on a
number of upper tool holder devices must be rotated in order
to exchange the upper tool on the upper table, thus causing
a problem in that the tool exchange work is complicated and
therefore troublesome.To overcome the above-mentioned problem, in DE-A1-39 32 629
an upper tool
and tool holder according to the preamble of claim 1
has been so far proposed such that
an hydraulic cylinder is attached for each upper tool holder
to fasten and unfasten the upper tool clamp with the
use of the attached hydraulic cylinder, respectively.In this conventional art upper tool holder device,
however, since a number of hydraulic cylinders must be provided
for a number of the upper tool holder devices independently,
and further since a hydropressure source is required additionally,
there exists another problem in that the structure is
complicated and therefore the manufacturing cost thereof is
high.Further, in the conventional art upper tool
