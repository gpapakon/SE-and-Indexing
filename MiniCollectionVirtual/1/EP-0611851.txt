<ABSTRACT>
The device mainly consists of a container (17) receiving the 
waste products flushed from a lavatory (1) and/or drained from 

any other sanitary appliance, a pressure control (26) installed 
inside the container (17), a pump (23) indirectly operated by the 

pressure control (26), pipes connected to the pump (23) for the 
pressure discharge of the waste products, the container (17) 

being completed by an openable lid (31) adequately sealed so as 
to prevent the overflow of any liquid or stench. 
The container (17) is divided into two compartments (19,20) by a 
partition wall (18), one of the compartments receives the waste 

products, while the other houses the pump (23), with the pipe 
fitting connected to the drain-pipe (21), the pressure control (26), 

the pump motor (27) and all the electrical installations and 
accessories required for its working.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is a well-known fact that it is not always possible to 
have a soil-pipe of the suitable slope and diameter 
required for adequately draining waste products and other 
solid matter, such as faeces, paper, etc., from 
lavatories. The problem may concern new drainage systems or systems 
where there is a short distance between the house drain 
and the sanitary appliances or, on the contrary, existing 
drainage systems where there is a considerable distance 
between the house drain and the sanitary appliances. Obviously, the two problems have different solutions, 
although the goal is a common goal. In the former case (a short distance between the house 
drain and the sanitary appliances), this invention 
provides for the installation of a container, located 
inside the lavatory, below the siphon, receiving the waste  
 
products coming from both the lavatory and/or the other 
appliances, when the water is flushed; said waste products 
being adequately triturated and then pressure discharged 
into the house drain. Furthermore, the invention also provides for the 
following: a triturator operating concomitantly with the 
pump in order to facilitate the trituration process, a 
pipe draining the water and the triturated waste products 
into the container, a second pump for draining the 
triturated and fluidized products from the container 
incorporated at the base of the lavatory to the house 
drain. As previously mentioned, this plant is particularly 
useful if the distance between the sanitary appliances and 
the pump is not too long; otherwise, the preferred device 
includes a container receiving the waste products from the 
lavatory and/or any other sanitary appliance, a pressure 
sensor located inside the container, a pump indirectly 
operated by the above mentioned pressure sensor, pipes 
connected to the pump for the pressure discharge of the 
waste products, the container being covered by an openable 
adequately sealed to prevent the leakage of any liquid and 
stench. This device may be better understood by reading the more 
detailed description which follows, making reference to 
the attached drawings:  Fig. 1, shows a vertical longitudinal section of a WC 
provided with this invention; Fig. 2, shows a vertical cross-section of the WC; Fig. 3, shows a schematical view of a device specifically 
devised in the case the lavatory is situated at a distance 
from the house drain; Fig. 4, shows an A---A cross-section of the device shown 
in fig. 3. With reference to figs. 1 and 2 of the lavatory 1, below

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for collecting and pressure discharging waste 
products from lavatories and/or any other sanitary 

appliances, as a rule featuring a container installed 
inside the lavatory bowl base and below the siphon, 

receiving the flushed waste products, after they have been 
triturated, and from which the sewage is then pressure 

discharged into the house drain. 
A device as per claim 1 also featuring the following: a 
triturator operating concomitantly with a pump, in order 

to facilitate the trituration process, a pipe carrying the 
water and triturated waste products into the container, a 

second pump for pressure discharging the triturated and 
fluidized waste products from the container and into the 

house drain. 
A device as per claim 1 in which the waste products and 
the water contained in the siphon reach the container 

through the siphon pipe and another pipe or opening 
leading to the container, along the way the waste products 

and other solid matter are triturated and then pass inside 
a pump which pressure discharges the triturated waste 

matter and water into the container. 
A device as per claim 1 in which the above mentioned 
container features an air-trap, while on the outside, but 

 
always within the base of the lavatary bowl, there is a 

pressure control and a condenser. 
A device as per claim 1 in which the container also 
receives the waste drained from the other sanitary 

appliances, the waste-pipe, if necessary, being provided 
with a stop valve, or any disconnecting system in general, 

preventing the backflow of the water into the water supply 
network. 
A device particularly adequate in the case the 
lavatory or sanitary appliance in general is far from the 

house drain, basically consisting of a container receiving 
the waste products flushed from the lavatory and/or 

drained from any other sanitary appliance, a pressure 
sensor installed inside the above mentioned container, a 

pump indirectly operated by the pressure sensor, pipes 
connected to the pump for pressure discharging the waste 

products, the container being closed with an openable lid 
adequately sealed so as to prevent the overflow of liquid 

or stench. 
A devise as per claim 6 in which the container is 
divided into two compartments by a partition wall, one of 

which receives the waste products, while the other houses 
the pump, with the pipe fitting connected to the drain-pipe, 

the pressure control, the pump motor and all the 
electrical installations and accessories required for its 

 
working. 
A device as per claim 6 in which the compartment 
designed to receive the waste products there is a probe 

communicating by means of a pipe with the pressure control 
housed inside a special water-tight box located inside the 

other compartment. 
A device as per claim 7 in which the probe, when the 
waste products enter or leave the compartment inside which 

it is housed, senses the change of pressure and sends a 
signal to the pressure control in order to switch the 

suction pump on or off, respectively. 
A device as per claim 1 provided with a check valve to 
prevent the back flow of the waste matter and a blowdown 

valve, with relative float, in the partition wall or 
elsewhere, with the height of suction in the compartment 

receiving the waste products.
