A floating ring seal for sealing off a rotary 
component, said seal
 being arranged between two pressure 
spaces subject to different pressures, comprising one or more 

floating rings, each floating ring being arranged in an 
annular space having mutually opposite wall surfaces arranged 

in radial and axial planes, characterized in that two wall 
surfaces (5 and 17) arranged at an angle to one another 

rotate at the speed of rotation of the rotary component (1), 
in that the wall surfaces (7 and 8) opposite to them are 

designed to be stationary, in that between stationary and 
rotary wall surfaces flow conducting sealing gaps are 

arranged, in that each floating ring (4) is arranged in a 
freely movable manner in an annular space (6) enclosed by the 

wall surfaces (5, 7, 8 and 17), regulating gaps (13, 14; 27 
and 28) being formed between the terminal sides (9 and 10) of 

the floating ring (4) and wall surfaces (5 and 8) opposite to 
the terminal sides (9 and 10) and in that the regulating gaps 

(13, 14; 27 and 28) are arranged at different diameters. 
The floating ring seal as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the external and/or internal peripheral 

surfaces of the floating ring (4) are provided with an open, 
honeycomb-like surface structure (24). 
The floating ring seal as claimed in claim 1 and in 
claim 2, characterized in that the wall surfaces opposite to 

the external and/or internal peripheral surfaces of the 
floating ring (4) are provided with an open, honeycomb-like 

surface structure (24). 
The floating ring seal as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 through 3, characterized in that the cross section 

of a floating ring (4) adapted to be employed as a vibration  
 

damper possesses a length able to be measured in the axial 
direction and equal to at least three times the height of the 

floating ring. 
The floating ring seal as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 through 4, characterized in that projections (11 and 

12) arranged on the wall surfaces (5 and 8) or on the 
terminal surfaces (9 and 10) of the floating ring extend into 

corresponding recesses (25 and 26) in the complementary 
surfaces. 
The floating ring seal as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 through 5, characterized in that the floating ring 

(4.1 and 4.2) is designed in two parts and is able to be slid 
axially. 
The floating ring seal as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that the floating ring halves (4.1 and 4.2) 

are arranged to be thrust apart by one or more springs (30).
