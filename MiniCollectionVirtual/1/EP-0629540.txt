<ABSTRACT>
There are provided a shock absorbing steering 
device and a method of manufacturing such a device. 

By this shock absorbing steering device a 
rotation of a steering wheel (7) is transferred to 

a steering gear (17) via a pipe-like first shaft (2) and 
a second shaft (3), which is inserted in the first shaft 

(2) so that transfer of rotation between the two shafts 
(2 , 3) and relative axial movement between the two 

shafts (2 , 3) are allowable. A ball (23) inserted in 
a through hole (20) formed through the first shaft (2) is 

held by a recess (21) formed on the outer surface of the 
second shaft (3), so that a portion of the ball (23) is 

projected from the outer surface of the second shaft (3). 
The inner surface of the first shaft (2) is plasticly 

deformed by the ball (23) by displacing the recess (21) 
away from the through hole (20) to form a groove (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shock absorbing 
steering device for absorbing a shock acting on a driver 
via a steering wheel in case of a car smash.  
 From EP-A-0 109 749 there is known a shock absorbing steering 
device which comprises grooves formed on the inner surface of 
the first shaft along the axial direction of the first shaft, 
recesses formed on the outer surface of the second shaft, and a 
plurality of balls a portion of which is projected from the 
outer surface of the second shaft, wherein the projected 
portions of the balls from the outer surface of the second shaft 
are inserted in the grooves and the grooves are formed by 
plastic deformation of the inner surface of the first shaft by 
the balls. This device incorporates a slide provided with 
deforming balls that roll tracks in the telescopic first and 
second shafts. The balls can roll in their tracks to permit 
relative sliding of the shafts on the application of a low axial 
load. The balls are received by holes of a ball guide which 
prevents that the balls come off the corresponding recess in the 
course of the manufacturing of the shock absorbing steering 
device. Only the plurality of balls will deform on the 
application of a shock energy to be absorbed by the device. Thus 
the manufacturing process is elaborate and the shock absorbing 
ability of this steering device may be insufficient resulting in 
a lack of reliability.  
 Fig.11 shows a conventional shock absorbing steering 
device (US-A-4,098,141) which comprises a column 
101 fitted on a vehicle body via a bracket 112, a pipe-like 
first shaft 102 inserted into the steering column 
101, and a second shaft 103 which is inserted in the 
first shaft 102 so that transfer of rotation between the 
two shafts 102, 103 and relative axial movement between 
the two shafts 102, 103 are allowable. The first shaft 
102 is connected to a steering wheel 113 via an input 
shaft 105 which is supported by the column 101 via a 
bearing 104. The second shaft 103 is connected to 
vehicle wheels via a steering gear (omitted from the 
figure). Two circumferential grooves 108 are formed on 
the outer surface of the second shaft 103. Each 
circumferential groove 108 faces two filler holes 109 
formed through the first shaft 102. Each circumferential  
 
groove 108 and each filler hole 109 are filled by 
synthetic resin 10 to form a shear portion. At the 
position away from the first shaft 102 to the steering 
gear side (i.e., to down side in Fig.11), a recess 103a 
is formed on the outer
