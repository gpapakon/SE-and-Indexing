<ABSTRACT>
A process apparatus whose chamber can be 
cleaned in a short time not exposed to air at all. At 

least two electrodes of first and second electrodes 
(107, 105) are provided in a vacuum vessel (108). A 

high-frequency power (112) having a first frequency is 
supplied to the first electrode (107), and a high-frequency 

power (101) having a second frequency different 
from the first frequency is supplied to the second 

electrode (105). A mechanism for supporting a wafer 
(106) is disposed on the second electrode (105), and a 

gas introduced into the vacuum vessel (108) is turned 
into a plasma by the powers. In this apparatus, a mechanism, 

by which the impedance between the second 
electrode (107) and a ground can be made enough 

larger than that between the first electrode and the 
ground, if necessary, is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process apparatus. In more 
detail, it relates to a process apparatus having a high 
performance provided with a self cleaning mechanism. The prior art will be described with reference to Fig. 
4. Fig. 4 is a sectional view of a vacuum vessel of a 
general plasma CVD apparatus. In Fig. 4, numeral 401 depicts a high-frequency 
generating apparatus, 402 an upper electrode, 403 a valve, 
404 a high-frequency matching circuit, 405 a lower 
electrode, 406 a wafer, 407 a heater for heating the wafer, 
408 a gas inlet, and 409 an evacuating port. In this apparatus, the wafer surface is accumulated 
thereon, for example, with SiO₂ film, a method of which is 
to dispose the wafer 406 on the lower electrode through a 
gate valve from another vacuum vessel (not shown). The 
wafer 406 is heated, for example, at about 400°C by the 
heater 407, and monosilane gas and oxygen gas are introduced 
thereto from the gas inlet 408. By means of the high-frequency 
generating apparatus 401, a high-frequency 
electric power, for example, having a frequency of 13.56 MHz  
 
is supplied on the upper electrode 402 to produce a plasma, 
then SiO₂ is accumulated on the wafer surface. At this 
time, the SiO₂ sticks not only on the wafer surface but also 
entirely on all inside surfaces of the vacuum vessel. The 
SiO₂ stucked on the inside surface of the vacuum vessel 
increases with the increase of the number of sheets of 
wafers processed, thus it separates and then sticks on the 
wafer surface, a production yield is considerably lowered, 
for example, in semiconductor manufacturing. To solve this problem, substances stucked on the inside 
surfaces of the vacuum apparatus are required to be removed 
by cleaning. A method of cleaning in the prior art includes a wet 
cleaning and a dry cleaning, which are described as follows. In the wet cleaning, the control proceeds to turn OFF 
the power supply to the heater 407, to lower a temperature 
of the lower electrode down to a room temperature, 
thereafter to closing the valve 403 of the evacuating port, 
and to introduce argon gas or nitrogen gas from the gas 
inlet 408. By thus introduced gas, an inside of the vacuum 
vessel is made into an atmospheric pressure from vacuum. 
After the inside of the vacuum vessel comes into the 
atmospheric pressure, gas supply from the gas inlet 408 is 
stopped and a cover (not shown) of the vacuum vessel is 
removed. Organic solvent such as isopropyl alcohol or 
ethanol or the like is suitably impregnated into cloth 
hardly
