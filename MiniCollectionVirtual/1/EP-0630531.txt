<DESCRIPTION>
 Ring Laser Pumped Optical AmplifierBackground of the InventionThe invention relates to optical amplification of optical signals in optical fibers, preferably telecommunication and CATV signals. Optical attenuation in fibers, splices, taps, couplers, and other components limit loss margins in transmission and distribution systems thus requiring signal amplification.Amplifiers for amplifying optical signals typically include electrooptic transducers which convert optical energy into electrical energy and vice versa, and hence tend to be complicated in design and expensive especially in high data rate or speed transmission systems.Recently, a lot of attention has been given to optical amplification as a solution to this amplification problem. Several types of amplifiers including Raman and semiconductor amplifiers have been investigated. However, for various technical reasons doped fiber amplifiers appear to present the closest approach for commercial application, the dopant being either rare earth or transition metals. One of the critical issues in doped fiber amplifiers is the method of pumping of the dopant atoms to achieve population inversion and optical gain while minimizing noise. Optical pumping at several wavelengths has been investigated, such as at 514 nanometers (nm), 635 nm, 820 nm, 980 nm and 1480 nm. Of these wavelengths, 980 nm and 1480 nm are most desirable due to their availability from semiconductor laser diodes.The amount of power available from semiconductor lasers is limited by thermal effects in the devices. The doped fiber amplifiers require the highest amount of power possible that can be handled by the doped fiber.This has led amplifier designers to try several approaches to maximize the power density of pump light which is coupled into the doped fiber core.One commonly accepted technique is to use dual laser pumps with each laser pump being coupled to an opposite end of the doped fiber. This approach suffers important drawbacks, the most significant of which is 

cross-talk between the two counter-propagating pump lasers. Another drawback is the need to coat the pump laser facets with multilayer reflective dielectric coatings. Such coatings add cost to the laser pumps and are a cause of laser failure. Coatings also reduce output power available for pumping. Furthermore, such coatings affect a wavelength of an output of the pump lasers which in turn affects the efficiency of pumping. This makes it necessary to have tight control of manufacturing the facet coatings, further
