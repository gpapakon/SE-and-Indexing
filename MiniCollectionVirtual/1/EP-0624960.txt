frequency response to a narrowband signal (104) having a sinusoidal component at 

ω

 radians per second. An illustrative embodiment comprises a signal divider (111), 
a signal combiner (119) and three signal paths (113,123,129) between them. The 

first signal path (113) advantageously comprises a first bi-phase attenuator (115), the 
second signal path (123) advantageously comprises a first delay element (125); and 

the third signal path (129) advantageously comprises both a second bi-phase

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric circuit design in general, and 
more particularly, to methods and apparatus which have a sloped frequency 
response. Many electric circuits have the adverse side effect of having a sloped 
frequency response such that the circuits attenuate, or amplify, signals having one 
frequency more, or less, than signals having a different frequency (often represented 
by a Bode plot with a linear frequency response curve having a non-zero slope). Embodiments of the present invention are capable of imparting a sloped 
linear frequency response to a signal while avoiding many of the costs and 
restrictions associated with prior methods. Specifically, embodiments of the present 
invention can be used in conjunction with utile circuits to correct the sloped 
frequency response characteristic of the utile circuit. Furthermore, embodiments of 
the present invention need not change the nominal phase, the center band amplitude 
or the group delay of the signal. These results are obtained in an illustrative embodiment of the present 
invention that comprises a first signal divider, a first signal combiner and three signal 
paths between them. The first signal path advantageously comprises a first bi-phase 
attenuator, the second signal path advantageously comprises a first delay element, 
and the third signal path advantageously comprises both a second bi-phase attenuator 
and a second delay element. The first delay element preferably makes the second 
signal path substantially close to 
2N + 18πω₀ 
seconds longer than the first signal path, 
where N is an integer and ω₀ is the frequency of a sinusoidal component in the 
narrowband signal input to the embodiment. The second delay element preferably 
makes the third signal path substantially close to 
2N + 14πω₀ 
seconds longer than the 
first signal path.  FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention. FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of another illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention. FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of yet another illustrative embodiment of 
the present invention. FIG. 4 shows a phase diagram of a typical signal on lead 109 of the 
illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 5 shows a phase diagram of a typical signal on signal path 113, 
upon entering signal combiner 119, of the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 6 shows a phase diagram of a typical signal on signal path 123, 
upon entering signal combiner 119, of the illustrative embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
