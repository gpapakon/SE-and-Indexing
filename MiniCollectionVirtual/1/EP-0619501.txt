<ABSTRACT>
A system for providing advance warning of underwater 
navigation hazards that threaten safe ship passage includes a 

sonar transmitter/receiver (16) adapted for mounting on the ship 
in a forward looking direction. A processor (24), in response to 

sonar returns produced by the sonar transmitter/receiver (16), 
produces a sonar produced slope profile (49) of a region of the 

sea bottom in front of the path of the vessel. A memory (44) 
stores a slope profile (52) of the region 
of the sea bottom in 
front of the vessel, such profile being developed from chartered 

depth data. The stored charted depth data developed slope 
profile (52) is compared with the sonar return produced slope 

profile (49) to determine whether the sonar produced slope 
profile and the chartered depth data slope profile are consistent 

with each other. If the sonar return produced slope profile in a 
region of the sea bottom is greater that a predetermined 

threshold level (selected to identify a potential forward 
undersea hazard) and the chartered depth data generated profile 

of such region does not indicate this potential hazard, an 
anomaly is identified and a signal indicating such anomaly is 

produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sonar systems and 
more particularly to sonar systems adapted to aid in the 
detection and avoidance of sea bottom hazards which could 
damage a sea going vessel's hull. As is known in the art, charted depth data is used as a 
primary navigation aid in avoiding reef and other sea bottom 
hazards. Sometimes this charted depth information changes 
over time because earth disturbances may create new, 
previously uncharted hazards. Thus, current underwater 
hazard avoidance techniques are supplemented with on-board 
sonar mapping of the sea's bottom. Current sonar imaging 
provides high resolution of the sea bottom profile when 
using a vertical, or substantially vertical, depth 
measurement. However, with the advent of large ocean-going 
vessels, particularly the new massive oil tankers, early 
warning of forward navigational hazards is required because 
of the relatively long intervals of time which are required 
either to slow down or to change course.  In accordance with the present invention a system for 
providing advance warning of underwater navigation hazards 
that threaten safe ship passage is provided. The system 
includes a sonar transmitter/receiver adapted for mounting 
on the ship in a forward looking direction. A processor, in 
response to sonar returns produced by the sonar 
transmitter/receiver, produces a sonar produced slope 
profile of a region of the sea bottom in front of the path 
of the vessel. A charted data produced slope profile is 
developed from charted depth data. The charted depth data 
developed slope profile is compared with the sonar return 
produced slope profile to determine whether the sonar 
produced slope profile and the charted depth data slope 
profile are consistent with each other. If the sonar return 
produced slope profile in a region of the sea bottom is 
greater that a predetermined threshold level (selected to 
identify a potential forward undersea hazard) and, if the 
charted depth data generated profile of such region does not 
indicate this potential hazard, an anomaly is identified and 
a signal indicating such anomaly is produced. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the system 
estimates the energy in sonar returns from a sea having a 
substantially flat bottom. The energy in sonar returns are 
then normalized by the estimated flat sea bottom energy to  
 
enhance the identification of hazardous high slope sea 
bottom profile regions.  For a more complete understanding of the concepts of 
the invention
