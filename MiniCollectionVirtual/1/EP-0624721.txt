<ABSTRACT>
By selectively changing the heating capacity of the lambda probe heating device and subsequently observing and evaluating the change in the temperature-dependent probe output voltage (ULS) caused thereby, faults in the mixture formation such as permanent lean or permanent rich mixture are distinguished from faults which relate to the lambda probe itself, such as short-circuit or breaks in the probe feed lines and only the fault which actually occurs is allowed to be stored.

<CLAIMS>
Method for distinguishing the sources of error in 
the mixture formation or mixture regulating system of an 

internal combustion engine in which a lambda regulator 
and a heated lambda sensor arranged in the exhaust duct 

of the internal combustion engine are used to regulate 
the fuel/air mixture fed to the internal combustion 

engine to a set-point value as a function of the output 
signal of the lambda sensor, 


the value of the sensor voltage (ULS) being continuously 
measured and 
compared with a lower diagnostic limit value (GWMIN) 
and an upper diagnostic limit value (GWMAX), 
the lambda regulator value (LAM) of the lambda regulator 
being varied in the direction of enrichment or 

leaning to the lambda regulation limit (LAM MAX, LAM 
MIN) when the lower or upper diagnostic limit value 

(GWMIN, GWMAX) is undershot or exceeded, and 
after the expiry of a time period (t1) during which 
there is no departure from the regulation limit (LAM 

MAX, LAM MIN), the heating output of the sensor heater 
being increased or lowered, 
and a permanently lean or permanently rich mixture 
formation error being inferred if the lower diagnostic 

limit value (GWMIN) for permanent leanness is exceeded 
again or the upper diagnostic limit value (GWMAX) is 

undershot again and 
otherwise a sensor fault being detected. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a time period (t2,t3) is allowed to elapse after  

 
variation of the heating output, and a counter is then 

initialized and the respective type of error is inferred 
when a maximum value (EPZ MAX) for the counter is 

reached. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the heating output of the sensor heater is increased 

to the highest possible value if the sensor voltage (ULS) 
drops below the lower diagnostic limit value (GWMIN). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sensor heater is switched off if the sensor 

voltage (ULS) exceeds the upper diagnostic limit value 
(GMAX).
