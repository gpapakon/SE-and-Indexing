<ABSTRACT>
The subjects of the invention are novel carbodiimides and/or oligomeric polycarbodiimides having terminal isocyanate, urethane and/or urea groups, obtainable e.g. by condensation with elimination of carbon dioxide of 1,3-bis(1-methyl-1-isocyanatoethyl)benzene and thereafter optionally partial or complete reaction of the free isocyanate groups of the resulting (poly)carbodiimides with aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or araliphatic amines, alcohols and/or alkoxypolyoxyalkylene alcohols, a process for their preparation and their use as a stabiliser against the hydrolytic degradation of polyaddition and polycondensation products containing ester groups.
