<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for use in adjusting an optical head 100 of a kind 
including a laser beam includes a Faraday rotator 101, a convex lens 103 

and a target 105 located on the beam optical axis. The Faraday rotator 
includes a coil surrounding a material exhibiting the Faraday effect for 

rotating the plane of polarization of the laser beam by applying a 
current to the coil, the convex lens is mounted upon a first mechanism 

which moves the lens along the optical axis in accordance with a first 
electrical signal, and the target is mounted upon a second mechanism 

which moves the lens transverse the optical axis in accordance with a 
second electrical signal. The target has at least one groove at its 

surface. The apparatus is used to generate servo signals equivalent to 
those generated by a reference disk conventionally used in adjusting an 

optical head.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for use in adjusting an 
optical head of a kind including a laser beam. An optical head is a device which applies a laser beam to an 
optical storage medium for reading information recorded on the medium 
through the reflected state of the laser beam. The optical head must 
have two functions. The first is an emitting function for applying a 
laser beam to an accurate position on the storage medium in an accurately 
focused state and, second, a signal detecting function for detecting the 
light reflected from the storage medium. Information is stored on an 
optical storage medium in accordance with the physical shape of the track 
at the surface of the disk or by means of the physical, chemical or 
magnetic state of the track. To read information, it is necessary to 
apply light accurately to the track and detect reflected light 
continuously. The following description refers to an optical disk as the 
optical storage medium, but the invention can be applied to other optical 
storage media. The emitting function comprises emitting a laser beam for recording 
and reproducing information onto and from the disk, accurately adjusting 
the focus of the laser beam by moving an objective lens along the optical 
axis by an actuator to focus the laser beam on a fine area on the disk, 
and tracking the laser beam to a track where a desired signal is 
recorded. These operations must be performed continuously while the 
laser beam is applied to the optical storage medium because fluctuations 
occur typically in a range of approx. 100 m in the optical axis direction 
during rotation of the optical disk due to planar inaccuracy of the 
medium, and fluctuations occur typically in a range of 50 to 100 m in the 
radial direction of the disk during rotation due to track inaccuracy. 
Therefore, it is necessary to continuously move the objective lens, by 
using the actuator, to apply the laser beam to the disk at the correct 
focus and in the correct tracking state. Information for detecting correct focus and a correct tracking 
state is included in the light reflected from the disk in the form of its 
intensity, wave front state and polarization. The reflected light also 
includes information recorded on the optical recording medium. These 
pieces of information are read by a signal detecting optical system which 
includes information detecting optics, focus signal detecting optics, and  
 
track signal detecting optics. Focus and tracking information is fed 
back to the actuator and
