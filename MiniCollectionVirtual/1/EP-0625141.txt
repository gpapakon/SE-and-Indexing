<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to amino acid derivatives, and more 
particularly to amino acid derivatives which possess anticholecystokinin 
activity. The invention also relates to 
methods for preparing such cholecystokinin antagonists and 
to compounds which are useful as intermediates in such 
methods. Cholecystokinins are peptides which have been found both in 
gastrointestinal tissue and in the central nervous system. 
Natural cholecystokinin is a 33 amino acid peptide (CCK-33), 
the C-terminal 5 amino acids of which are identical to those 
of gastrin and caerulein. Also found naturally is the C-terminal 
octapeptide (CCK-8) of CCK-33. The cholecystokinins are believed to be important in the 
regulation of appetite. They stimulate intestinal motility, 
gall bladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, 
and they also inhibit gastric emptying. A classification scheme for cholecystokinin receptors has 
recently been proposed in which the receptors coupled to 
contraction of the gall bladder are termed CCK-A, while 
those found in the brain are termed CCK-B. A number of cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists have been 
reported in the literature. Possible therapeutic uses for 
CCK-A antagonists include the control of appetite disorders 
such as anorexia nervosa, and the treatment of pancreatic 
inflammation, pancreatic cancer, biliary tract disease, 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and various psychiatric 
disorders. Other possible uses are in the potentiation of 
opiate (eg. morphine) analgesia, and in the treatment of 
cancers. Moreover, ligands for CCK-B receptors have been 
claimed to possess anxiolytic activity. EP-A-0433064 discloses a class of naphthylsulphonylalkanoic  
 
acid compounds which are said to be cholecystokinin 
antagonists. The compounds are of the general formula 
 
wherein R3 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 
1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group; 1 and m are the same 
or different and are an integer of from 1 to 4; n is 1 or 2; 
and the definitions of R1 and R2 include groups such as C1 to 
C6 alkyl, C3 to C6 cycloalkyl and C1 to C6 alkoxy groups. The present invention is based on the finding that the 
moiety 
 
which is an essential element of the compounds disclosed in 
EP-A-0433064, is not in fact essential for activity. We 
have found that it can be replaced by a 2-naphthylsulphonamido 
group, or by certain other arylsulphonamido 
groups. Also, we have found that certain 2-naphthylsulphonamido 
compounds and analogues possess 
antagonist activity at the gastrin
