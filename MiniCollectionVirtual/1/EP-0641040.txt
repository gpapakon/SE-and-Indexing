<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to push the female connector strip in by means of a flat stamp pressing against it from above, the fastening sections of the contact springs are guided in a clamping manner, parallel to the push-in parts (2), at least in certain areas between an inner insulating material body (4) and an outer insulation material body (6), and the contact springs are povided with in each case one recess (3) in the fastening section, into which recess (3) the inner insulating material body (4) engages, in each case by means of a tab (5), transversely with respect to the push-in parts (2).

A press-in spring strip for pressing into bores in a printed circuit
board,

having spring contacts which are each made from a strip of sheet metal and
comprise, as seen in the direction in which the strips extend, in each
 case a press-in part
(2), a securing portion and a contact part (1), and having a two-part insulating material

body (4, 6) in which the spring contacts are each individually arranged in chambers and
secured, the spring contacts being arranged in two rows and the securing portions being

guided, at least in certain regions, between an inner insulating material body (4) and an
outer insulating material body (6) in clamping manner parallel to the press-in parts (2),

   characterised

a) in that the spring contacts are provided in the securing portion with
a respective rectangular recess (3)
b) in which the inner insulating material body (4) engages
transversely with respect to the press-in parts (2) in each case by means of a lug

(5), and
c) in that the inner insulating material body (4) extends as a central
body between the two rows and the outer insulating material body (6) is pushed in

the manner of a hat onto the spring contacts and the inner insulating material body
(4).
A press-in spring strip according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
spring contacts in the contact part (1) are constructed as double contacts.
A press-in spring strip according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the spring contacts are held, by means of a respective protruding part (7) provided
in the securing portion, in clamping manner between the two insulating material parts (4,

6).
A press-in spring strip according to one of Claims I to 3, 
characterised in
that
 the spring contacts are bent in each case into an S shape in the region between the
press-in parts (2) and the regions of the securing portions guided parallel thereto.
A press-in spring strip according to Claims 3 and 4, 
characterised in that

the securing portions of the spring contacts each have in the order of the direction
extending from the press-in part (2) to the contact part (1) an S-shaped bend, a recess (3),

a protruding part (7) and a region (11) formed only by two narrow parallel outer webs.
A press-in spring strip according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in
that
 the press-in parts (2) are resilient and constructed in their cross-sectional geometry
such that a large lever arm is produced for the forces of deformation acting at the time of

pressing in. 
A press-in spring strip according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in
that
 for use as a sub-miniature plug connector a front sheet (8) is pushed onto the outer
insulating material body (6), the two insulating material parts (4, 6) being bracketed

together by means of sheet-metal brackets (9) integrally formed on the front sheet (8).
A press-in spring strip according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 below
the front sheet (8) a metal screen cage (12) reaching down as far as the printed circuit

board is provided.
A process for pressing in a press-in spring strip according to one of Claims
1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the tips of the press-in parts (2) are placed on the bores in a
printed circuit board, and 
in that
 then a flat die is used to press against the outer insulating
material body (6) in the direction of the printed circuit board until spacer feet (10) abut

against the printed circuit board.
