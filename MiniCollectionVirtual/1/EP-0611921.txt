<ABSTRACT>
A simulated solid fuel fire includes a rear reflector, 
which may be curved, a screen which diffusely transmits 

light and reflects light and a flag-like member positioned 
between a rear reflector and screen. Simulated fuel is 

positioned in front of the screen and means are provided to 
illuminate the fuel, the flag-like member and the rear 

reflector. A reflecting surface reflects light in such a 
way as to cause perception of colours. The rear reflector 

includes reflective regions situated below a darkened area. 
Luminous flame-shaped images, tinged with colour, can be 

perceived between shadows on the screen, the images 
emanating between the fuel and its reflected image. When 

the simulated fuel resembles logs, light illuminates the 
upper surfaces to promote realism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for simulating
flames in a solid fuel fire. A simulated solid fuel fire
may be part of, or embodied in a heating appliance, such as
an electric or gas fire, in order to create an impression of
flames due to burning fuel.Numerous attempts have been made in the past to improve
realism in a simulated flame display, or in devices which
simulate a solid fuel fire and use mechanical parts which
are illuminated in some way and set into motion to produce
a visual effect resembling flames. Whilst some of these
past attempts have achieved a degree of realism, many more
have been poor imitations of flames and therefore
unconvincing to the viewer. In view of the attraction of
real flames, the Electrical Industry has constantly sought
to achieve a form of realism that it is almost
indistinguishable from real flames, particularly for
creating the impression of combusting solid fuel (such as
burning logs or coal). Such an effect is highly important
in achieving commercial success with electrical fires.In our UK Patent No. 2 180 927 we disclosed means for
simulating fuel, a light source of illuminating the
simulated fuel and first and second reflective means
arranged to provide front-to-back multiple images of the
simulated fuel. The first reflective means was capable of
transmitting light as well as being capable of reflecting
light, the means for simulating fuel being provided between
the first and second reflective means. The reflective
means were arranged so that the multiple images could be
perceived, as a visible effect, from the exterior of heating
apparatus. This multiple image effect is particularly
useful in giving the impression of a deep or extensive fuel
bed and thereby provided a distinct advantage when designing
so-called "slim-line" electrical heaters. In our UK Patent No. 2 230 335, we disclosed apparatus
which included a source of light, simulated flame effect
means for reflecting the light to simulate flames, simulated
fuel means illuminated by the light source to simulate a bed
of combusting fuel, and screen means on which to view an
image of the simulated flames. The screen means was
positioned between the flame effect means and the simulated
fuel means and was capable of diffusely transmitting light
reflected by the flame effect means. This provided a
visual effect, on the screen means, which simulated flames.
The screen means was also capable of reflecting light from
the simulated fuel, so that the simulated flames appeared to
emanate from between the simulated

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for simulating flames of a solid fuel fire, the
apparatus comprising:


a screen capable of reflecting and diffusely transmitting
light (7);
simulated fuel (9) positioned in front of the screen so
that a reflected image of the fuel (9) is visible in the screen

(7);
means positioned behind the screen (7) for simulating
flames including a member or members (17) and means for causing

the member or members to move (16) so as to simulate flames;
means (10,11) for illuminating the simulated fuel (9) and
the member or members (17);

   characterized in that:

the apparatus further comprises rear reflecting means (3)
illuminated by the illuminating means (
10,11) and including an
upper darkened or blackened area (4) and reflecting regions

(5,6) situated below said darkened or blackened area (4), the
rear reflecting means further including a reflecting surface

adapted to diffract or refract the light from the illuminating
means (10,11) to produce reflected light of perceptible

colours; and
said member or members (17) are positioned between the
rear reflecting means (3) and the screen (7) such that said

member or members (17) randomly provide shadows on the screen
(7), and that luminous flame-shaped images tinged with colour

can be perceived between the shadows on the screen (7),
the arrangement being such that the flame-shaped images
appear to emanate between the simulated fuel (9) and its image

on the screen (7).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said rear
reflecting means (3) is concave about a vertical axis.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said member or
members (17) are apertured and shaped to assist in producing a

flame shaped image on the screen.
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said member (17) is
located centrally in front of the concave reflecting means (3)

whereby the simulated flames are perceived at different
positions along the width of the screen (7). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein the
member or members (17) comprise a flag-like piece of material.
Apparatus according to any of claims, wherein the flag-like
piece of material (17) is generally coffin-shaped and has

a slit (21) and a diamond shaped aperture (19) therein.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim further
comprising a fan (16) and whereby the member (17) is moveable

in the air stream of the fan so as to simulate flames.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim in which the
illuminating means (10,11) includes a source of substantially

white light.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim in which the
illuminating means includes a bulb or bulbs (10,11) which are

positioned at the side or sides of the member (17) to provide
said flame-shaped images and shadows on said screen (7).
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein said
reflecting surface comprises metallised film or foil which

diffracts or refracts light in such a way as to produce said
light of percepible colours.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim in which the
simulated fuel (9) is in the form of imitation logs and in

which illuminating means (14) also directs light onto an upper
surface of the logs to promote realism.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim further
including means for simulating sparks (22) in the simulated

flames comprising pieces of reflective material which move in
the airstream from the fan (16) and thereby reflect flashes of

light onto the screen (7) to simulate said sparks.
