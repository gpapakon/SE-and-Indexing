<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superconducting motor utilizing 
bulk-shaped superconductors. The device disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent publication 
No. 289344/1991 has been known as a superconducting motor. This superconducting mutor is comprised of a shaft, a disk-shaped 
armature secured to the shaft and superconducting coils 
disposed opposite to the armature. The superconducting coils also 
have a container for liquid helium and a radiation shield. This superconducting motor is of a type wherein a magnetic 
field generated from the excited superconducting coil provides the 
armature with a torque. Specifically, the superconducting coils have been cooled by 
liquid helium below the critical temperature thereof and are in a 
superconducting state. Therefore, the superconducting coils are 
easily excited by supplying an electric current thereto so that they 
are turned into magnets having a high magnetic flux density.  
 However, the above-described superconducting motor has problems 
as follows. First, quenching may occur at the superconducting 
coils. The term "quenching" means a phenomenon that a normal conducting 
area which has been locally generated expands continuously 
causing the entire superconductor to be rapidly transformed into a 
normal conducting state. Such quenching results from applying a 
current and/or a magnetic field higher than a critical current 
and/or a critical magnetic field specific to the superconductor. 
Further, such quenching is likely to occur especially in wires. In addition, a superconductor has an electric resistance in the 
normal conducting state. Therefore, Joule heat is generated corresponding 
to an electric current flowing therein. Therefore, when quenching occurs in the superconducting coils 
of the above-described superconducting motor, the Joule heat generated 
from the coils can cause the liquid helium to boil, resulting 
in damages in the liquid helium container etc. due to an 
increase in the pressure therein. The Joule heat can also melt 
down the coils themselves. Accordingly, the output of the conventional superconducting 
motor as described above is limited because attention must be paid 
to quenching. This also adversely affects its efficiency. Further, the boiling point of liquid helium is as low as about 4 
K. So, the liquid helium container must have a special adiabatic 
mechanism. Specifically, the special adiabatic structure must be 
provided, wherein liquid nitrogen is circulated around the container  
 
with a vacuum adiabatic
