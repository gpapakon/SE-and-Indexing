<ABSTRACT>
Illumination module for liquid-crystal matrix-configured instruments (1), comprising a case (5) including a bottom (8) and side walls (7), the said matrix closing the case on its face opposite the bottom, and at least one fluorescent tube (9) being arranged in the case near the bottom. The said bottom is reflecting and shaped into at least one parabolic cylindrical surface, the axis of the said fluorescent tube being substantially coincident with the focal line of the said surface.

<CLAIMS>
A lighting module for an instrument with a liquid
crystal matrix (1), comprising a casing (5) having a base

(8) and side walls (7), the said matrix closing the casing
on its face opposite the base, and at least one fluorescent

tube (9) being disposed in the casing close to the base, the
said base being reflective and shaped as at least one

parabolic cylindrical surface, and the axis of the said tube
being substantially merged with the focal line of the said

surface, 
characterised by
 the fact that the plane of
symmetry (12) of the said parabolic cylindrical surface is

inclined with respect to the plane of the said liquid
crystal matrix.
A lighting module according to Claim 1, in which the
said base is shaped as a plurality of parabolic cylindrical

surfaces whose focal lines are parallel.
A lighting module according to either one of Claims 1
and 2, comprising a diffuser (14) between the casing and the

liquid crystal matrix, at a distance from the base of the
casing such that the illumination resulting from the sum of

the lambertian flux coming directly from the tube and the
collimated flux reflected by the parabolic cylindrical

surface is substantially homogeneous.
