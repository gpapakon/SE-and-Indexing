Semiconductor photodetector with a channel (K), which connects two terminal
poles (E, E'), of semiconductor material, which is laterally and vertically bounded by

potential barriers and which is laterally limited at the edges with barrier regions (B, B') by
space-charge zones (R, R'), wherein the space-charge zones (R, R') lie in the light-sensitive

region of the photodetector and these are reducible by incident light,
characterised in that the potential barrier is formed vertically by a quantum wave structure.
Detector according to claim 1, characterised in that the layer sequence forming the
quantum wave structure is formed by a first layer (1') as buffer layer of GaAs, second layer

(2) as potential well layer of InGaAs and third layer (3) as cover layer of GaAs following on
a semi-insulating GaAs substrate.
Detector according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the barrier regions (B, B')
form pn transitions with the channel material.
Detector according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the barrier regions (B, B')
are executed as insulating regions.
Detector according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a substrate
carrying the detector structure is transparent to the light to be detected.
Detector according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the channel
consists of several part channels, which surround island-like insulated barrier regions.
Detector according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the barrier regions
have a trapezium-shaped structure.
Detector according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by control electrodes
arranged laterally of the channel for control of the sensitivity of the detector.
Detector according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the channel is
formed by one or more potential well layers. 
Detector according to one of claims 2 to 9, characterised by circuit elements which
apply such a voltage to the terminal poles (E, E') that a saturation of the channel current

occurs during operation of the detector.
Detector according to one of claims 2 to 10, characterised by a multiple
arrangement in the form of lineal arrays or areal arrays.
Method of producing a semiconductor photodetector according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the layer sequence forming the quantum wave

structure is formed on an insulating substrate and potential barrier regions for lateral
structuring of the flow channel are produced perpendicularly to the layer sequence.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the lateral potential barriers (4)
are produced by a selective insulation implantation by chemically indicated charge carrier

compensation without damage-induced crystal defects with oxygen ions by means of a
mask technique and subsequent temporary conducting out at temperatures above 600Â°C.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the lateral potential barriers (4)
are formed by insulation regions, which are produced by a damage-induced selective

insulation implantation by means of a mask technique or by damage-induced focussed ion
implantation.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the lateral potential barriers (4)
are formed by pn transitions, which are produced by a selective implantation by means of

a mask technique or a focussed implantation of doping ions with the respective charge
carrier type other than in the conductive layer (2, 5) and subsequent carrier activation by

curing.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that the lateral potential barriers (4)
are formed by vacuum regions and realised by a selective trench etching by means of wet-chemical

or plasma-chemical methods.
Method according to one of claims 12 to 15, characterised in that vertical potential
barriers are formed by use of heterostructures, which are produced by an epitaxial growth

method. 
Method of producing a semiconductor photodetector according to claim 1,
characterised in that the detector structure is produced thereby that the insulation regions

or doped regions of the charge carrier type other than in the conductive layers are
produced directly in the substrate wafer by use of selective implantation techniques or a

focussed ion beam and subsequently the conductive layers are realised by an epitaxial
overgrowth technique.
Method of producing a semiconductor photodetector according to claim 1,
characterised in that the conductive layers (2, 3) are produced with a selective

implantation process by ion bombardment or with a focussed ion beam within a non-conductive
layer.
