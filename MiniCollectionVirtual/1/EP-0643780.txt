<ABSTRACT>
A non-aqueous cleaning process uses an organic solvent for removing soil or surface contamination from contaminated articles such as printed circuit boards which are cleaned by immersion into a sump compartment of a cleaning tank contaning the organic cleaning solvent. The organic solvent is preferably a hydrocarbon solvent. The cleaned articles, now coated with the organic cleaning solvent, are then disposed in a rinsing sump containing a fluorocarbon based rinsing solvent having an affinity for the organic cleaning solvent. The organic solvent is thus removed from the articles which are then dried without waste water as in a conventional solvent vapor degreasing solvent process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of cleaning contaminated articles, and more particularly, to the defluxing
or degreasing of parts in a non-aqueous cleaning system utilizing an organic solvent for cleaning the parts and a
nonflammable hydrofluorocarbon solvent.Solvent vapor phase degreasing and defluxing is a process of immersing a soiled substrate (e.g., a printed circuit
board or a fabricated metal, glass, ceramic, plastic or elastomer part or composite) into a boiling, nonflammable liquid
such as a chlorocarbon or chlorofluorocarbon fluid or admixture, followed by-rinsing the part in a second tank or cleaning
zone by immersion or distillate spray with a clean solvent which is the same chlorocarbon or chlorofluorocarbon as
used in the first cleaning zone. The parts are then dried by maintaining the cooled part in the condensing vapors until
temperature has reached equilibrium.Solvent cleaning of various types of parts generally occurs in batch, hoist-assisted batch, conveyor batch, or in-line
type conveyor degreaser and defluxer equipment. Such in-line conveyor degreaser and defluxer equipment are
disclosed in co-pending U.S. Patent application Serial No. 07/410,216, filed September 21, 1989, (entitled Cold Air
Lock Vapor Seal"), now U.S. Patent 5,007,179, commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Parts
may also be cleaned in open top defluxing or degreasing equipment, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 07/587,893, filed September 25,1990, also commonly assigned. In both types of equipment, the entrance
and/or exit ends of the equipment are generally in open communication with both the ambient environment and the
solvent within the equipment. In order to minimize the loss of solvent from the equipment by either convection or
diffusion, a common practice in the art is to use water-cooled or refrigerant-cooled coils which create a condensed
vapor blanket over a hot or ambient zone region in the degreaser/defluxer tank, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent
4,261,111 to Rand.Therefore, in the foregoing solvent vapor phase degreasing process, it is generally known to use a single organic
chlorocarbon or chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) fluid to perform the cleaning, rinsing, and drying steps. The use of CFC-113
and Freon type solvents have been, in the past, particularly popular. However, the vapor diffusion thereof into the
environment has been implicated in recent scientific studies to be one of many possible contributing causes to the
undesirable global
