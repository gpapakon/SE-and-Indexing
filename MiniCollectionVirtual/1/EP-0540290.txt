<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an expandable 
stent (10) for implantation in a body lumen, such as an 

artery, and a method for making it from a single length 
of tubing. The stent (10) consists of a plurality of 

radially expandable cylindrical elements (12) generally 
aligned on a common axis and interconnected by one or 

more interconnective elements (13). The individual 
radially expandable cylindrical elements (12) consist of 

ribbon-like material disposed in an undulating pattern. 
The stents (10) are made by coating a length of tubing 

(21) with an etchant-resistive material and then 
selectively removing portions of the coating to form a 

pattern for the stent (10) on the tubing (21) to expose 
the portions of the tubing to be removed. This may be 

done by machine-controlled activation and relative 
positioning of a laser (24) in conjunction with the 

coated tubing (21). After the patterning of the tubing 
(21), the stent (10) is formed by removing exposed 

portions of the tubing (21) by an etching process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to expandable
endoprosthesis devices, generally called stents, which
are adapted to be implanted into a patient's body lumen,
such as blood vessel, to maintain the patency thereof.
These devices are very useful in the treatment of
atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels.Stents are generally tubular shaped devices
which function to hold open a segment of a blood vessel
or other anatomical lumen. They are particularly
suitable for use to support and hold back a dissected
arterial lining which can occlude the fluid passageway
therethrough.Further details of prior art stents can be
found in U.S. Patent 3,868,956 (Alfidi et al.); U.S.
Patent 4,512,338 (Balko et al.); U.S. Patent 4,553,545
(Maass et al.); U.S. Patent 4,733,665 (Palmaz); U.S.
Patent 4,762,128 (Rosenbluth); U.S. Patent 4,800,882
(Gianturco); U.S. Patent 4,856,516 (Hillstead); and U.S.
Patent 4,886,062 (Wiktor).Various means have been described to deliver
and implant stents. One method frequently described for
delivering a stent to a desired intralumenal location
includes mounting the expandable stent on an expandable
member, such as a balloon, provided on the distal end of
an intravascular catheter, advancing the catheter to the
desired location within the patient's body lumen,
inflating the balloon on the catheter to expand the stent
into a permanent expanded condition and then deflating 
the balloon and removing the catheter. One of the
difficulties encountered using prior stents involved
maintaining the radial rigidity needed to hold open a
body lumen while at the same time maintaining the
longitudinal flexibility of the stent to facilitate
its delivery.What has been needed and heretofore unavailable
is a stent which has a high degree of flexibility so
that it can be advanced through tortuous passageways
and can be readily expanded and yet have the
mechanical strength to hold open the body lumen into
which it is expanded.One prior art device which goes someway towards
addressing this problem is described in US-A-4,994,071.
The described stent includes a trunk
portion constructed from a series of generally
parallel oriented loops interconnected by a series of
half-hitch connections which extend along an axial
dimension. In combination the series of loops form a
generally cylindrical lattice or matrix.The present invention is directed to an
expandable stent which is relatively flexible along
its longitudinal axis to facilitate delivery through
tortuous body lumens, but which is stiff and stable
enough radially in an
