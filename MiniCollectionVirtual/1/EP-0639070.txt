<ABSTRACT>
Water-soluble borate-polyol complexes are useful as buffers and/or antimicrobials in aqueous ophthalmic compositions, including those containing polyvinyl alcohol. These compositions have greater antimicrobial activity than comparable compositions containing typical borate buffers and unexpectedly increase the antimicrobial efficacy of other antimicrobial agents when used in combination. In addition, use of the borate-polyol complexes avoids the incompatibility problem typically associated with the combination of borate buffer and polyvinyl alcohol; therefore, the compositions disclosed herein may also contain polyvinyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of borate-polyol
complexes in ophthalmic compositions. In particular, these
complexes are useful as buffers and/or antimicrobial agents
in aqueous ophthalmic compositions, including those
ophthalmic compositions containing polyvinyl alcohol.Ophthalmic compositions often include such
adjuvants as buffers, tonicity-adjusting agents and
viscosity-enhancing agents. Such adjuvants are discussed,
for example, in EP-A-109561, FR-A-1473318 and EP-A-0436726.Ophthalmic compositions are generally formulated
to have a pH between about 4.0 and 8.0. To achieve a pH in
this range and to maintain the pH for optimal stability
during the shelf life of the composition, a buffer is often
included. Borate is the buffer of choice for use in
ophthalmic compositions, since it has some inherent
antimicrobial activity and often enhances the activity of
antimicrobials. However, when polyvinyl alcohol(PVA) is
also an ingredient in the composition, borate and PVA form a
water-insoluble complex which precipitates out of solution
and acts as an irritant in the eye. This incompatibility of
borate and PVA in contact lens solutions is well-known, and
has been discussed, for example, in an article by P.L. Rakow
in Contact Lens Forum, (June 1988), pages 41-46. Moreover,
borate buffer cannot be effectively used below pH 7.0 due to
its low buffering capacity to lower pH.Since borate is incompatible with PVA, ophthalmic
compositions containing PVA are generally buffered with
acetate, phosphate or other buffers. There are
disadvantages of using these alternative buffers: for
example, acetate is a weak 
buffer (pKa of about 4.5), so a relatively large amount is needed; on the other
hand, phosphate is a good buffer but, when used in concentrations generally found
in ophthalmic formulations, it reduces the antimicrobial activity of preservatives.It is well known that small organic compounds, such as
benzalkonium chloride (BAC), chlorhexidine, thimerosal have excellent
antimicrobial activity; however, it is now known that these small organic
antimicrobials are often toxic to the sensitive tissues of the eye and can accumulate
in contact lenses, particularly soft, hydrophilic contact lenses. More recently,
polymeric antimicrobials such as Polyquad® (polyquaternium-1) and Dymed®
(polyhexamethylene biguanide) have been used in contact lens care products as
disinfectants and preservatives. While these polymeric antimicrobials exhibit a
broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, they generally have relatively weak
antif
