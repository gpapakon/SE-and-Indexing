<ABSTRACT>
A process for image-moderated metallisation of structured printed circuit boards is described, in which the finished structured printed circuit board is covered with a solder resist mask while leaving the solder contact points free, the solder resist mask is heated under conditions such that complete hardening does not yet take place and the copper surface of the printed circuit board remains practically unoxidised, metal from an aqueous bath is deposited on the exposed solder contact points and, after the metal deposition, the mask is heated for a suitable period of time to a suitably high temperature so that the mask is completely hardened. The incomplete prehardening prevents the solution from infiltrating into the mask during the metallisation, which would decrease the adhesion of the mask.

<CLAIMS>
A method of image-wise metallisation of structured printed circuit boards
with a copper surface thereon, in which the finished structured printed circuit board is

covered with a solder resist mask with the soldering contact locations cut out, the
solder resist mask is thermally hardened and metal is deposited from an aqueous bath

at the exposed soldering contact locations, 
characterised in that
 the solder resist mask
is heated prior to the metal deposit step under such conditions that only partial

thermal hardening is effected and the copper surface of the printed circuit board is
practically not oxidised, and the mask is completely hardened after the metal deposit

step by heating.
A method according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the solder resist mask is
produced by applying a layer comprising a mixture which is hardenable by exposure to

light and by heating to the structured surface, exposing the layer in image-wise
fashion with the soldering contact locations cut out, and removing the unexposed

regions of the layer by washing off with a developer.
A method according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the metal is deposited in
a current-less procedure from the aqueous bath.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 3 
characterised in that
 the metal is
tin, nickel and/or gold.
A method according to claim 2 
characterised in that
 the mixture which is
hardenable by exposure and heating includes


a) a compound with at least one terminal ethylenically unsaturated group
which can form a cross-linked polymer by radically initiated addition chain

polymerisation,
b) a water-insoluble polymer binding agent which is soluble in aqueous-alkaline
solutions, 
c) a radiation-activatable polymerisation initiator or a polymerisation initiator
combination,
d) a compound which is capable of cross-linking with itself, with the binding
agent (b) or with the polymer of compound (a) in heat, and
e) possibly a heat-activatable cross-linking initiator for the compound (d).
A method according to claim 5 
characterised in that
 the mixture additionally
contains


f) a finely divided mineral pigment.
A method according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the solder resist mask is
heated prior to the metal deposit step for up to 15 minutes to a temperature in the

range of 100 to 150°C.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 7 
characterised in that
 the solder
resist mask is heated prior to the metal deposit step with the exclusion of oxygen.
A method according to claim 8 
characterised in that
 the solder resist mask is
heated prior to the metal deposit step under a protective gas atmosphere.
A method according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the solder resist mask
is heated after the metal deposit step for 15 to 90 minutes to a temperature in the

range of 120 to 180°C.
