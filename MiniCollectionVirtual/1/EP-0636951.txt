<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrophotographic 
printer which can make printing first on the front side 

of a sheet of paper and then on the back side of the 
same sheet with conformity between the front and back 

sides in the head-bottom arrangement of the printed 
images. The printer has a photocounductive drum (20) which 

can be rotated both in a normal direction and in the 
reverse direction, an exposure unit (30) to produce 

electrostatic latent images on the drum surface, first 
developing means for developing the latent images with a 

toner when the drum is rotating in the normal direction, 
second developing means for developing the latent images 

with a toner when the drum is rotating in the reverse 
direction, a transfer unit (40) for transferring the 

developed images to a sheet of paper, and first and 
second fixing means (50A,50B) which are oppositely arranged with 

respect to the transfer unit. For printing on the front 
side of the paper sheet, the sheet is passed through the 

transfer unit (40) in a first direction toward the first 
fixing means while the drum is rotating in the normal 

direction. For printing on the back side of the sheet, 
the sheet is further conveyed by a returning route (60) which 

turns so as to reverse the sheet and extends to the 
transfer unit, and, while the drum is rotating in the 

reverse direction, the reversed and returned sheet 
passes through the transfer unit in the opposite second 

direction toward the second fixing means (50B).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic 
pinter which can perform printing on both sides of a 
sheet of recording medium such as paper. In conventional electrophotographic printers 
a photosensitive drum having a photoconductive layer on 
the cylindrical surface rotates on its center axis in a 
predetermined direction. In the printing process 
electrostatic latent images are produced on the 
photoconductive surface of the rotating drum, and the 
latent images are developed into visible images with a 
toner. Then a sheet of paper is forwarded so as to make 
contact with the rotating drum at a location where an 
image transfer means is provided, and the toner images on 
the drum surface is transferred onto the front side of 
the paper. After that the transferred images are fixed 
to the paper by application of heat. To successively perform printing on the back side 
of the paper sheet it is necessary to convey the sheet 
from the fixing station to the paper inlet of the image 
transfer means and reverse the sheet during this 
conveyance. In many cases the conveyor system for this 
purpose includes a switchback mechanism which has the 
advantage of being simple in construction. However, 
after the operation of the switchback mechanism the 
retrogressive movement of the paper sheet results in 
inversion of the head-bottom arrangement of the sheet. 
When the sheet is printed on both sides, the head of the 
page on the back side is at the back of the bottom of 
the front page. This is quite inconvenient for  
 
fastening similarly printed sheets of paper together. As a solution for the above problem, JP 63-54060 A 
discloses an electrophotographic printer in which the 
direction of rotation of the photosensitive drum is 
temporarily reversed at the initial stage of the process 
of printing on the back side of a sheet of paper after 
printing on the front side. That is, while the drum is 
reversely rotated a train of imaging information is 
supplied to the drum surface until the formation of 
latent images for one page. During this operation the 
developing and image transferring treatments are 
suspended. After that the drum is rotated in the normal 
direction, and the developing and image transferring 
treatments are made in the usual way to accomplish 
printing on the reversed sheet of paper. This printer 
employs a switchback mechanism to reguide the paper 
sheet printed on the front side to the transfer unit, 
permitting inversion of the head-bottom arrangement of 
the sheet, but the inversion is
