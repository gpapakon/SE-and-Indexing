<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides for both a pharmaceutical preparation and a method for inhibiting in vivo the replication of viruses. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical preparation is a complex of dextran and cytochalasin-D which may be administered in an appropriate dosage form, dosage quantity and dosage regimen to a patient suffering from a viral disease such as AIDS.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF CYTOCHALASINS FOR INHIBITING VIRAL REPLICATIONThis invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation and method for inhibiting replication of a family of viruses know as human immunodeficiency virus HTLV-III (AIDS) virus.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONCertain retrovirus infections have been known to depress immune functions in animals. In recent years, it has been discovered that a family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses causes T-cell proliferation leukemia, helper T-cell depletion, and immunosuppression in humans infected by these viruses. These viruses have become known as the HTLV family of retroviruses. A group of these viruses designated as HTLV-III has been isolated from patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and has become considered to be responsible for the development of this condition in humans. These are also known as HIV, particulary HIV-1 and HIV-2.A cell line representative of this group has been deposited under ATCC No. CRL 8543 by an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Since the epidemic was first recognized in 1981, rapidly increasing numbers of cases of AIDS have been diagnosed in the United States. Significant progress has resulted from research in selected areas including identification of the populations at risk for AIDS, the methods of transmission of the causative agent, isolation and characterization of the virus that causes AIDS and development of a serologic test that identifies most infected individuals.On the .other hand, little progress has been made toward effective treatment of AIDS. Azidothymidine (AZT), a drug that inhibits reverse transcriptase prolongs the lives of patients with AIDS and many patients who receive AZT have temporary 

 increases in the numbers of circulating helper (CD4 ) T- lymphocytes. However, the drug has significant adverse effects and HIV has been isolated from the blood of patients even while they are under treatment with AZT.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention provides for a pharmaceutical preparation for inhibiting in vivo the replication of viruses which comprises a complex of dextran-cytochalasin D in an appropriate pharmaceutical dosage form. The invention also provides a method for inhibiting jLn. vivo the replication of HIV viruses comprising the administration of a dextran-cytochalasin D complex in a pharmaceutically appropriate dosage form and quantity.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSIn the figures which disclose example embodiments of the invention, figure 1 is a graph indicating the

<CLAIMS>
 WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A pharmaceutical preparation for inhibiting in vivo the replication of various viruses including the various HIV viruses which comprises a compound selected from the class consisting of cytochalasins.
2. The pharmaceutical preparation of claim 1 wherein the cytochalasin is cytochalasin-D.
3. A pharmaceutical preparation for inhibiting in vivo the replication of various viruses including the various HIV viruses which comprises a complex of a compound selected from the class consisting of cytochalasins and a dextran sulphate or dextran of any molecular weight.
4. The pharmaceutical preparation of claim 3 wherein the cytochalasin is cytochalasin-D and the molecular weight of the dextran sulphate is 40,000.
5. The pharmaceutical preparation of claim 3 wherein the cytochalasin is cytochalasin-D and the molecular weight of the dextran sulphate or dextran is 8,000.
6. The pharmaceutical preparation of claim 3 or 4 wherein the dextran sulphate or dextran is substituted by a polysaccharide exhibiting a slow release mechanism.
7. _ The pharmaceutical preparation of claim 6 wherein the polysaccharide is dextrin or cyclodextrin.
8. The pharmaceutical preparation of the preceding claims including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
9. A pharmaceutical preparation for inhibiting in vivo the replication of viruses which comprises a complex of dextran 


sulphate or dextran and cytochalasin D in an appropriate pharmaceutical dosage form.
10. The pharmaceutical preparation of claim 9 wherein the viruses are HIV viruses.
11. A method for inhibiting in vivo the replication of HIV viruses comprising the administration of a complex dextran or dextran sulphate and cytochalasin D in a pharmaceutically appropriate dosage form and quantity.
12. A process for coupling dextran sulphate to cytochalasin-D comprising modifying the dextran sulphate to dextran dialdehyde by reacting the dextran sulphate with periodate, and thereafter reacting the dextran dialdehyde with cytochalasin-D.
13. A complex of dextran and cytochalasin-D when prepared by the process of claim 12.
