<ABSTRACT>
In order to establish data links between differently structured subscriber stations, the invention calls for a central modem (modem pool) to be connected into the circuit. When establishing links for which a central modem needs to be used, service-indicator data in conformity with the relevant ISDN protocol is generated to designate the service to be carried out by the modem on the destination side of the modem.

<CLAIMS>
Method for producing data connections in an auxiliary-exchange 
communications installation (KA), in 

which a central modem (MODPL) is inserted between the 
terminals involved in the setting up of the connection in 

dependence on terminals (T1, ..., T5) involved in a 
respective connection setup, characterized in that during 

the setting up of a connection originating from a terminal 
constructed as ISDN terminal implementing an A/B 

service (fax group 2, fax group 3, data via modem, vtx 
via modem) or of a data transmission service (64 kbit/s), 

this terminal forms a first service indicator information 
(SIN) in conformity with the relevant ISDN protocol, 

which designates the respective service, in that when a 
central modem (MODPL) is inserted and when a digital 

trunk module (TMD) is connected, a second service indicator 
information is formed for designating the service 

implemented on the destination side by the inserted 
central modem (MODPL), and in that the second service 

indicator information (SIN) or, when the central modem 
(MODPL) is not inserted, the first service indicator 

information (SIN), if it designates the data transmission 
service, is supplied to the digital trunk module (TMD) 

for ISDN signalling. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the insertion of the central modem (MODPL) is activated 

by an ISDN terminal by means of dialling information.
