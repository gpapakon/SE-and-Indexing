 .MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES SPECIFIC FOR HUMAN THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field The present invention relates, in general, to monoclonal antibodies and, in particular, to monoclonal antibodies that are specific for thymidylate synthase.Background Information The fluoropyrimidines are an important group of antineoplastic agents that are widely used in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, breast tumors, and epithelial tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract (Danenberg, P.V. (1977) Biochim. BiophÎ³s. Acta Acta 473. 73-92; Santi, D.V., McHency, C.S. and Sommer, M. (1974) Biochemistry 13. 471- 480; Moertel, C.G. (1978) N. Engl. J. Med. 299. 1049-1052). Thymidylate synthase (TS; EC 2.1.1.45) catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monphosphate (dTMP) . The de novo synthesis of dTMP is an essential step in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides and DNA biosynthesis (Santi, D.V. and Danenberg, P.V. (1984) In Folates and Pterins. eds. Blakley, R.L. and Benkovic, S.J. (Wiley, New York), pp. 345-398; Heidelberger, C. (1975) In Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Vol. 38. eds. Sartorelli, A.C. and Johns, D.G. (Springer Verlag, New York), pp. 193-231) . TS enzyme inhibition is one of the main biochemical events underlying the antineoplastic action of the fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) .SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 Once metabolized to FdUMP, this etabolist forms a tight-binding covalent complex with TS in the presence of 5-10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2H4PteGlu) . The TS enzyme exists as a di er of identical subunis, each 36 kD in size, and has been purified and well characterized from various sources. A striking degree of homology exists between the amino acid sequence of human TS and TS from other sources such as bacteria, parasite and yeast (Hardy, L.W. , Finer-Moore, J. , Montfort, W. , Jones, M. , Santi, D.V. and Stroud, R.M. (1987) Science 235. 448-4553). Since TS provides the sole de novo source of thymidylate, which is crucial for DNA synthesis, the maximal cellular TS activity occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle and is 20-fold higher in rapidly proliferating cells than in nondividing cells (Conrad, A.H. and Ruddle, F.H. (1972) J. Cell. Sci. 10. 471-486; Navalgund, L.G., Rossann, C., Muench, A.J. and Johnson, L.F. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255. 7386-7390; Johnson, L.F. (1984) In Recombinant DNA and Cell Proliferation, eds. Stein, G.S. and Stein, J.L. (Academic Press, New York), pp. 25-47).
