<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing an extracellular heme protein in increased yields, the process comprising culturing an apoprotein producing microorganism in a fermentation medium containing heme or a heme-containing material under conditions permitting the production of active, recombined heme protein, and recovering the resulting heme protein from the culture medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing heme
proteins in increased yields.The cloning and expression of varius heme proteins in bacteria
has previously been described. Thus, S. A. Ortlepp et al., J.
Biotechn.11, 1989, pp. 353-364, describe the expression and
characterisation of horseradish peroxidase C in E.coli. The
enzyme is expressed intracellularly as an insoluble aggregate so
that it has to be purified from lysed cells. Furthermore, the
enzyme is not expressed in active form and must be folded
separately in the presence of heme and Ca2+ to become functional.
Similarly, A.T. Smith et al., J. Biol. Chem.265(22), 1990, pp.
13335-13343, describe the expression of horseradish peroxidase
C in E.coli. The recombinant enzyme has less activity than
native horseradish peroxidase C and is produced in a yield of 2-3%
(of the purified, active enzyme). S. Loprasert et al., J.Bact.171(9), 1989, pp. 4871-4875, report the cloning and
expression in E.coli of peroxidase A from Bacillus
stearothermophilus. S.J. Hoffman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA87, pp. 8521-8525, describe the expression of functional
human hemoglobin in E.coli. Z. Wang et al., J. Biotechn.13,
1990, pp. 131-144, describe the cloning and expression of lignin
peroxidase from Streptomycesviridosporus in Streptomyces
lividans.Expression of human hemoglobins in yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae) has been described by M. Wagenbach et al,
Bio/Technology9, 1991, pp. 57-61. In yeast, hemoglobin is
expressed as a fully assembled, heme-containing tetramer.
However, the protein is not secreted from the yeast cells, but
remains in the cytoplasmic space and must be purified therefrom. It would therefore be advantageous to select a host organism,
such as a filamentous fungus, which is capable not only of
producing heme proteins but also of exporting them through the
cell membrane in active form, thereby simplifying purification
procedures.In recent years, procedures have been developed for the
transformation of filamentous fungi, including Aspergillusniger
and Aspergillusnidulans. US 4,885,249 (Allelix) describes a
general process for the transformation of A.niger, exemplified
by the introduction of plasmids carrying genes encoding
selectable markers. EP 215 594 (Genencor) describes the
expression and secretion of various proteins in A.nidulans,
using the signal sequences of different Aspergillus proteins to
provide secretion.Neither of these references indicates the possibility of
producing heme proteins in filamentous fungi. On the contrary,

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing an extracellular heme protein in
increased yields, the process comprising culturing a

filamentous fungus, which has been transformed with a
recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA sequence

encoding a heme protein, and which overproduces and secretes
the corresponding apoprotein, in a fermentation medium

containing heme or a heme-containing material, under conditions
where the heme group is bound to the apoprotein, and recovering

the resulting heme protein from the culture medium.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the DNA sequence
encodes a heterologous heme protein.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the filamentous
fungus is a strain of 
Aspergillus,
 e.g. 
Aspergillus oryzae
 or

Aspergillus niger.
A process according to any of claims 1-3, wherein the heme
protein is an oxidoreductase or a catalase.
A process according to claim 4, wherein the oxidoreductase
is a peroxidase or a haloperoxidase.
A process according to claim 5, wherein the peroxidase is
derived from a species of 
Coprinus,
 e.g. 
Coprinus macrorhizus

or 
Coprinus cinereus,
 or 
Arthromyces,
 e.g. 
Arthromyces ramosus.
A process according to any of claims 1-6, wherein the heme-containing
material is hemoglobin or red blood cells.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the fermentation

fermentation medium additionally contains a surface active

agent.
