<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave
filter (hereinafter referred to as a SAW filter) as claimed in
the preamble of claim 1. Such filter is already known from GB-A-2 116 387.A SAW filter is generally characterized in that the same is miniaturized
and has steep filter characteristics. In general, therefore,
SAW filters of various structures have been proposed and put into
practice.Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view showing a three IDTs type
SAW filter 1 as an exemplary conventional surface acoustic wave
filter. The SAW filter 1 comprises three IDTs 3 to 5 which are
arranged on a rectangular piezoelectric substrate 2. Numerals 6
and 7 denote reflectors. In the SAW filter 1, first comb
electrodes of the IDTs 3 and 5 are connected in common to define
an input end, while a first comb electrode of the IDT 4 serves as
an output end. Second comb electrodes of the IDTs 3 to 5 are
connected to earth potentials. Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view showing another exemplary
conventional SAW filter 8. The SAW filter 8 comprises two IDTs 9
and 10 which are arranged on an upper surface of a piezoelectric
substrate 2 along a surface wave propagation direction.
Reflectors 6 and 7 are arranged on both sides of the IDTs 9 and
10. In such a two IDTs type SAW filter 8, first comb electrodes
of the IDTs 9 and 10 are employed as input and output ends
respectively. Second comb electrodes of the IDTs 9 and 10 are
connected to earth potentials.Fig. 3 is a schematic plan view showing still another
exemplary conventional SAW filter 11. The SAW filter 11, called
an interdigited interdigital type (hereinafter reffered to as
IIDT type) SAW filter, comprises seven IDTs 12 to 18 which are
arranged on an upper surface of a rectangular substrate 2 along a
surface wave propagation direction. First comb electrodes of
the IDTs 12, 14, 16 and 18 are connected in common to be employed
as an input end, while first comb electrodes of the IDTs 13, 15
and 17 are connected in common to be employed as an output end.
Second comb electrodes of the IDTs 12 to 18 are connected to
earth potentials respectively.In such an IIDT type SAW filter 11 which is formed by
arranging a number of IDTs 12 to 18, it is possible to reduce
insertion loss.As hereinabove described, various structures of SAW filters
have been proposed for reducing insertion loss. When reduction 
of insertion loss is intended in a SAW filter, however, an amount
of attenuation cannot be much increased in the vicinity of its
pass band. Particularly in a SAW filter employing the
