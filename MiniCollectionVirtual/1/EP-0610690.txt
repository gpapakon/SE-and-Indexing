<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for implementing the method are proposed, with the aid of which a spigot end (3) can be formed on the end opposite the pipe bell of a concrete or reinforced concrete pipe (1), which has been shortened to fitting length, economically and accurately. In this case, after an initial radial saw cut which makes the fitting length of the pipe, an outer pipe end face (7) is produced, into which subsequently an axial stepped bore (18) is driven, which is exactly concentric with the pipe (1) and which produces the two different diameter steps (8, 9) and the intermediate central annular end face (10). Finally, by means of a further radial saw cut, if appropriate with cutting through of outer reinforcing bars (5), the end face (13) extending from the pipe external circumference to the inner end of the stepped bore (18) is produced and the cut-off annular waste piece is removed.

Method of making a spigot end with two steps in diameter on a 
concrete or reinforced concrete pipe, in which transverse faces 

lying in planes perpendicular to the pipe axis are created by 
radially guided saw cuts, if required with cutting through of 

the steel reinforcement, characterized in that: 

a) starting first from the axially outer transverse face, extending 
as far as the pipe internal diameter, an annular stepped bore 

concentric to the pipe axis is driven in the axial direction 
into the concrete or reinforced concrete pipe over the length of 

the spigot end with the creation of both diameter steps and of 
the middle transverse face situated axially between them, after 

which 
b) a radial saw cut forming the axially inner transverse face 
extending to the pipe external diameter is made right up to the 

inner end of the stepped bore, and finally 
c) the annular waste piece created by the stepped bore and the 
radial saw cut is removed from the spigot end. 
Method of making a spigot end with two steps in diameter on a 
concrete or reinforced concrete pipe, in which transverse faces 

lying in planes perpendicular to the pipe axis are created by 
radially guided saw cuts, if necessary with cutting through of 

the steel reinforcement, characterized in that, 

a) starting from the axially outer transverse face extending as far 
as the pipe internal diameter, the annular stepped bore 

concentric to the pipe axis is driven in the axial direction in 
the concrete or reinforced concrete pipe over the length of the 

spigot end with creation of both the diameter steps and of the  
 

middle transverse face situated axially between them, and 
finally 
b) first, a radial saw cut forming the axially inner transverse 
face extending as far as the pipe external diameter is made as 

far as the inner end of a stepped bore yet to be formed, 
whereupon 
c) the annular waste piece created by the stepped bore and the 
radial saw cut is removed from the end of the spigot. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, as 
first process step, 


a radial saw cut producing the exact pipe length and thus 
forming the axially outer transverse face, extending to the pipe 

internal diameter, is first made. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the stepped bore is produced in one operation. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the concrete or reinforced concrete pipe is rotated about its 

axis while the radial saw cuts are made, but is held stationary 
while the stepped bore is driven. 
Apparatus for performing the method according to at least one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized by 


a) a pipe holding bed (21) comprising a plurality of at least 
partly driven rollers (22), for the centring support of, 

rotational journalling of and peripheral friction drive of a 
concrete or reinforced concrete pipe (1),  

 
b) a pipe saw (19), mounted on the pipe holding bed (21) above the 
rollers (22) and movably guided perpendicularly to the pipe axis 

for adjustment in height and drivable for the feed, and 
c) a tool carrier unit (30) comprising a core drill (15), rotatably 
drivable about a drive axis, movably guided in the axial 

direction and drivable for the feed, the drive axis of which is 
adjustable to align with the pipe axis. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that, on the 

pipe holding bed (21), several spaced apart rollers (22) are 
mounted on each of two parallel, spaced apart shafts (23, 24), 

that one of the shafts (24) is rotatably drivable with the 
rollers (22) mounted thereon, and that the distance between the 

two shafts (23, 24) can be adjusted to suit the pipe external 
diameter. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that, for 
adjusting the distance between the two shafts (23, 24), the two 

shafts are each adjustable by equal distances but in opposite 
directions. 
Apparatus according to at least one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the pipe saw (19) is aligned with its 

circular saw blade (20) perpendicularly to the pipe axis and is 
fixed to a cantilever arm (26), which is guided by an adjusting 

slide block (27) on a vertical column (28) fixed laterally to 
the pipe holding bed (21). 
Apparatus according to at least one of claims 6 to 9,

motor block (33) is guided adjustably and displaceably in the 
three coordinate directions, and that a drive shaft (14) is

Apparatus according to at least one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that the core drill (15) is of two-step 

construction, comprising an outer core drill ring (16) creating
