<DESCRIPTION>
 -1- FAST FLUSH CATHETER VALVE Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to valves used in medical applications, and more particularly, to valves having both drip and flush flow rates. Background of the InventionFast flush valves are used in catheter systems in which the blood pressure of a patient is monitored. A typical catheter system includes a saline solution source that is connected by tubing to an inlet of a fast flush valve and an outlet of the valve is connected to a pressure transducer. Down¬ stream of the pressure transducer, a three way stop¬ cock is typically connected by tubing between the pressure transducer and a catheter that is inserted in the patient. This catheter system permits the flow of saline solution from the source through the valve, transducer, and stopcock to the catheter and then the patient.A capillary mounted within the fast flush valve reduces the saline solution flow to a drip rate 

 that prevents the blood of the patient at the catheter insertion site from-clotting. Thus, the saline solution in the tubing connecting the pressure trans¬ ducer to the catheter remains in fluid communication 5 with the blood of the patient. The fluid communica¬ tion between the saline solution at the pressure transducer with the blood of the patient permits the blood pressure of the patient to be monitored. When a larger volume of saline solution is needed to purge -J_Q impurities from the system, the valve is actuated to provide a flush flow through the valve which clears the system out.While the use of fast flush valves within such catheter systems is previously known, these ic valves have been relatively expensive to produce.Typically these valves require a number of components that require alignment and careful assembly to produce a reliable and fluid tight valve. The manufacturing process of such a valve can be either labor intensive0 or require intricate machinery to perform the assem¬ bling tasks. What is needed is a fast flush valve for use in a catheter system that is simple to construct and inexpensive to make. Summarv of the Invention5 It is an object of the present invention to provide a fast flush valve that can be used in a 

catheter system that is simple to manufacture and inexpensive to make.The object of the present invention is achieved in a flush valve easily constructed from a few simple components. The valve of the preferred embodiment of the invention includes a valve body having a longitudinal bore through the body for fluid flow. An elasto eric tube

-13- 1. A catheter fast flush valve comprising: a valve body having a longitudinal bore therethrough for fluid flow through said valve body and* a valve core bore substantially transverse to said 5 longitudinal bore and intersecting said longitudinal bore; a tube forming an elastomeric valve core inserted in said valve core bore, said tube normally blocking said longitudinal bore through said valve 10 body; a capillary longitudinally oriented in said longitudinal bore and extending transversely through said tube, said capillary providing a drip flow path through said tube; and •*_

 means for deforming said tube whereby fluid may flow around said tube through said longitudinal bore.
2. The valve of claim 1 wherein said body has a
20 vertical bore perpendicular to said longitudinal bore and said deforming means further comprising: an* actuating member slidingly received within said vertical bore perpendicular to said longitudinal bore in said valve body, said actuating member being slidable within said vertical bore to
25 project into said longitudinal bore to deform said tube to unblock said longitudinal bore for flush flow.

3. The valve of claim 2, said deforming means further comprising: resilient biasing means mounted about said actuating member to return said actuating member
5 within said vertical bore .to a position that permits said tube to substantially block said longitudinal bore.
4. The valve of claim 3, said resilient biasing 10 means further comprising: a resilient radial diaphragm connected to said actuating member; and a collar mounted about said actuating member and connected to said valve body, said radial dia- •
j
e phragm extending from said actuating member to said collar.
5. The valve of claim 4, said collar further comprising:
0 a pair of wings pivotably mounted to said collar, each of said wings having an outboard end adapted to engage said valve body to secure said deforming means to said valve body and to hold said tube within said valve core bore.

6. The valve of claim 5, said wings further comprising: a plug extending from said outboard end of said wing, said plug being received within said tube 5 to expand said tube within said valve core bore whereby said longitudinal bore blocking by said tube is improved.
7. The valve of claim 1, said longitudinal bore 10 further comprising: an inlet to permit fluid to enter said longitudinal bore; an outlet to permit fluid to exit said longitudinal bore; and 
]
_ a relief area located adjacent said tube and between said inlet and said tube whereby said relief area permits a back flow to overcome the blocking of said longitudinal bore by said tube and flow over said tube into said longitudinal bore towards said inlet.

8. A method for manufacturing a flush rate flow valve comprising: molding a valve body having a longitudinal bore, a valve core bore, and a vertical actuating
5 member bore, said longitudinal bore, said vertical actuating member bore, and said valve core bore being mutually orthogonal to one another; press fitting a valve core within said valve core bore to substantially block said longitudinal
10 bore; inserting a capillary into said valve core substantially blocking said longitudinal bore; inserting a first end of an actuating member into said vertical actuating member bore; and resiliently connecting a second end of said 5 actuating member to the exterior of said valve body.
9. The method of claim 8 further comprising: mounting a seal about said actuating member; and 0 securing said seal about said actuating member.
