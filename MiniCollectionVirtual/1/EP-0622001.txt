<DESCRIPTION>
 IMAGE INPUT DEVICE HAVING OPTICAL DEFLECTION ELEMENTS FOR CAPTURING MULTIPLE SUB-IMAGES Background of the InventionThe present invention relates to an imaging system for selectively providing either a low resolution real-time image or a high resolution scanned image. More particularly, the invention relates to a camera-like imaging system in which high resolution digital capture of an image is provided by combining a series of sequentially obtained sub-images.It is known to increase the resolution of a video camera either by increasing the number of pixels in the image sensor or by increasing the number of image sensors. Either approach typically increases the cost of the camera.An alternative method of increasing resolution uses just one image sensor, but uses that image sensor to capture only a portion (sub-image) of the desired image. A series of sub-images called "tiles" are sequentially captured and stored in the memory of an image processor. The image processor combines ("stitches") the tiles together to form a composite ("mosaic") image. Tiling systems, however, present a number of problems involving the capture of the sub-images. The sub-images should fit together tightly, avoiding both overlap of tiles or gaps between tiles. A high degree of repeatability in the tile 

 capture process is desirable, because repeatable (characterizable) errors can be corrected. Because of the complexity involved in acquiring the tiles, known tiling systems have been limited to highly sophisticated and costly applications, such as satellite imaging of the earth. The present invention uses tiling to provide a low cost scanner for commercial applications. A low cost tiling system, incorporated as part of a scanning camera, could find application, for example, as an aid to the visually impaired, as the imaging component of a face-up copying system for books, as an x-ray film scanner, as a variable resolution desktop scanner, as a microfilm copying system or as a video teleconferencing input device.It would be desirable to provide a scanning camera with both a real-time mode and a high resolution mode.It would also be desirable to provide a scanning camera with a highly repeatable, low cost tiling system.It would further be desirable to provide a tiling mechanism with minimal settling time.It would still further be desirable to provide a scanning camera with zoom and prescan capabilities.Summary of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide a scanning camera with both a real-time mode and a
