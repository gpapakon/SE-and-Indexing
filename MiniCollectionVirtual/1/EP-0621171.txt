<ABSTRACT>
A steering system is described for the front 
wheel (R) of a motor vehicle, the hub (10) of which is 

connected to the suspension (1, 7) by pivot means (9) 
which define the steering axis, said axis being suitably 

inclined to the rear to form the necessary trail (AV). In 
this system said hub possesses an upward extension (10A) 

connected to the handlebars (12) by a linkage comprising: 
at the end of said extension (10A, 110) a first pivot 

(24) of transverse axis connecting it to a first end of 
a connecting rod (16); and a control bar (18) connected 

at a first end, via a Hooke-type joint or equivalent 
(20), to the axis of the handlebars (12), and at the 

second end, via a second pivot (22) of transverse axis, 
to the other end of said connecting rod (16). Means 

(16; 22; 24) are also provided to enable the control bar 
(18) to swing with respect to the hub extension (10A, 

110) about an essentially longitudinal axis lying in the 
vertical mid plane of the wheel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a steering system for the
front wheel of a motor vehicle, the hub of which is
connected to the suspensions by pivot means which
define the steering axis, said axis being suitably
inclined to the rear to form the necessary trail.More particularly, the invention relates to a
steering system of the kind including: a handlebar; a
supporting member or hub for the front wheel; a
suspension to which said supporting member is hinged
about a steering axis; and a link assembly connecting
said handlebar to said supporting member, said link
assembly including a control bar a first end of which
is linked to said handlebar by means of a Hook-type
joint or equivalent, and a connecting rod a first end
of which is hinged via a first pivot having a
transverse axis to a second end of said control bar,
the second end of said connecting rod being connected
to said supporting member via a second pivot having a
trasverse axis.Such a steering system is known from
EP-A-0 235 040. In this known system the control bar
and the connecting rod are of equal length and are
mutually connected by a pivot. The connecting rod is
subject to both torsional as well as flexural or
bending stresses.This known steering system is not suitable for use
in small-wheeled motorcycles or motor scooters.Further steering systems have been designed, all of
which have several disadvantages, both in term of
mechanical complexity as well as in cost of production.The front suspension of the present-day motor
vehicles is generally formed by an elastically
telescopic fork supporting the wheel pin on both sides
of the wheel. As an alternative, a rigid fork may be 
employed, whose lower ends carry pivots for two
swinging arms supporting the wheel pin. The assembly
involves a trailing wheel if the pivots of the swinging
arms are ahead of the axle of the wheel and a leading
wheel if said pivots are behind it. In other
embodiments the suspension is formed on one side only
of the wheel to make it easy to remove. Only half the
fork remains, and is strong enough to support the
swinging arm and the wheel in a side-mounted
arrangement.All these systems have in common the fact that the
pivot on which the wheel is steered is located above
the wheel on the mid plane of the vehicle inside a
tubular member of the frame called, as on bicycles, the
headset. This system entails some elasticity in the
steering of the wheel, heavy loads on the steering
bearings, especially during braking, owing to the
height of these bearings off the ground, and large
bend

<CLAIMS>
A steering system for the front wheel (R, R1) of
a motor vehicle having a single front steering wheel,

including: a handlebar (12); a supporting member (10A;
110) for the front wheel; a suspension (1, 7, 101, 201)

to which said supporting member (10A; 110) is hinged
such as to be pivotable about a steering axis; and a

link assembly (16, 18, 20) connecting said handlebar
(12) to said supporting member (10A), said link

assembly including a control bar (18) a first end of
which is linked to said handlebar (12) by means of a

Hook-type joint or equivalent (20), and a connecting
rod (16) having a longitudinal axis (A-A), a first end

of which is hinged via a first pivot (22), having an
axis transverse to the vertical mid plane of the wheel

(R; R1), to a second end of said control bar (18), the
second end of said connecting rod (16) being connected

plane of the wheel (R; R1); 
characterized in that
 said
first pivot (22) and said second pivot (24) are

mutually connected by said connecting rod (16) in such
a way that during steering the axes of said pivots can
