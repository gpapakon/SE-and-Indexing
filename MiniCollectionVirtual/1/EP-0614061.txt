<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compact plate-type
heat exchanger/control device assembly, easy to install and
maintain, particularly intended for wall-mounted heating
boilers of the combined type and associated exchanger.It is known that self-contained heating systems are
ever more often adopted for family dwelling buildings, to
perform the dual functions of space heating in wintertime
and producing hot water for household use.The "heart" of those systems is the heat generator,
which usually takes the form of a wall-mounted boiler and
is to fill several basic demands, such as demands for
reliability, efficiency, compactness, and ease of
maintenance.The essential components of a wall-mounted boiler
include the heat exchanger between the primary fluid, i.e.
the system heating circuit, and the sanitary fluid, i.e.
the delivery water, as well as devices for controlling the
primary flow through the exchanger to meet the demand for
heated sanitary water.It should be clear, in fact, that for efficient
overall operation of the system, the primary fluid should
only be supplied to the exchanger and transfer its heat
contents to the sanitary fluid on actual demand for
sanitary water, thereby to avoid wasted heat and load
losses across the primary circuit while no actual demand
for heated water exists.These components should be compact and easy to install
and maintain.Plate-type heat exchangers have been known which are
compact, efficient, occupy a very small volume of about of
80 x 180 x 35 mm, and comprise a plurality of plates
juxtaposed to form two sets of intercalated flow-through
chambers for the primary and the sanitary flows,
respectively. Such exchangers, which are generally parallelepipedic
in shape, carry, on a larger rectangular face thereof, four
unions for connection to delivery and discharge pipes,
respectively for the primary and the sanitary fluid.An example of such exchangers is provided by GB-A-2234337,
where it is shown that union pairs may be located
on the two opposed, larger rectangular end faces of the
exchanger.By reason of the exchanger construction and
operability, the unions are positioned near the corners of
the rectangular face (or opposed end faces), at aligned
locations to internal openings arranged to put the
chambers of one set into mutual communication.This considerably restricts the possible coupling
arrangements between the exchanger and the control device
which is also provided, in general, with inlet/outlet
unions for the primary and sanitary fluids whose relative
spacings
