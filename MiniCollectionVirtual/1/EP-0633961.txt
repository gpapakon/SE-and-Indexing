<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of treating a fibre suspension to alter its liquid content, wherein the suspension is fed into a rotationally symmetrical displacement space (12) whose outer limiting surface (4A) rotates around the axis of symmetry, which surface (4A) is permeable to fluid and is affected by a fluid under pressure acting from the outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention relates to a method and a 
device for treating fibre suspensions, in particular for 
washing a fibre suspension in the form of cellulose pulp. It is well known that fibre suspensions exhibit 
very special properties which demand special measures in 
connection with treating such suspensions. Washing a 
fibre suspension is an example of a treatment of this 
nature which requires special measures because of the 
special behaviour of a fibre suspension. More or less 
complicated apparatus for this purpose is already known. 
A feature possessed in common by these known processes 
and devices is, however, that, in connection with the 
actual liquid penetration phase, there is physical contact 
between a significant part of the fibre suspension 
and some form of sieving device. In connection with pulp 
production, in particular, such physical contact is 
undesirable since it gives rise to friction between the 
pulp bed and the sieving device, which in turn can cause 
disturbances in the feed-through of the pulp bed. An object of the present invention is to present 
a method and a device which make it possible to change 
the liquid content of a fibre suspension in an effective 
manner without exposing the pulp bed to undesirable 
physical stresses. The above mentioned object is achieved with the 
aid of a method according to the invention which is 
described in Patent Claim 1 and with the aid of a device 
as described in Patent Claim 10. From EP-A-0337 432 there is known a method of 
treating a fibre suspension to alter its liquid content, 
whereby the suspension is fed into a displacement space 
(12) whose outer limiting surface (2B) rotates around the 
axis of symmetry, which surface (2B) is permeable to 
fluid and is affected by a fluid under pressure acting  
 
from the outside. In this known method for washing a 
fibre suspension there is physical contact between a 
significant part of the fibre suspension and the sieving 
device of the washing apparatus. Further the displacement 
space is divided into several compartments, which 
increases the total area of pulpcontacting surfaces of 
the washing apparatus and which also eliminates the 
possibility of layering of the suspension as a result of 
the centripetal acceleration. Accordingly there are 
essential differences between a method known from EP-A-0337 
432 and our invention which is characterised in that the 
displacement space is an undivided annular space and is rotated 
with a rotational speed sufficient to establish, by

Method for treating a fibre suspension to alter its liquid content, wherein the 
suspension is fed into a displacement space (12) whose outer limiting surface (2B) 

rotates around an axis of symmetry, the surface being permeable to fluid and is 
affected by a fluid under pressure from the outside, 
characterized
 in that the 
displacement space is an undivided annular space and is rotated with a rotational 

speed sufficient to establish, by centripetal acceleration of the fibre suspension, a fibre 
layer between the fluid supplied through the permeable outer surface of the 

displacement space and the liquid of the fibre suspension, the fibre layer 
providing a pressure against the outer limiting surface of displacement space 

which at least essentially is balanced by the pressure from the fluid. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the fibre layer forms an 
unbroken ring-shaped fibre layer enclosing an inner liquid. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the pressure from the 
fluid acting from the outside is equal to or exceeds the pressure with which the fibre 

layer acts against the outer limiting surface, which latter pressure is dependent on the 
centripetal acceleration. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the fluid is forced 
through the fibre layer due to the pressure on t
he fluid. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the 
fluid forms a layer between the fibre layer and the limiting surface, and the fibre layer 

and the liquid layer are moved through the displacement space in a direction 
corresponding to the axis of symmetry. 
Method according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the liquid layer is 
withdrawn from the displacement space by an outlet member arranged in a radial 

direction relative to the axis of symmetry of the displacement space. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the displacement space 
is at least partially delimited by an inner limiting surface.  

 
Method according to claim 7, 
characterized
 in that the inner surface is 
liquid permeable. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
 
in that the fibre suspension is fed into the displacement space via a channel (9) or 

several channels (11) which at least in part are located at a shorter radial distance 
from the axis of symmetry than the displacement space. 
Device for carrying out the method according to claim 1, comprising 
an axle (1), which is arranged to be rotatable by means of a bearing element (7) and 

which possesses a suitable element (8) for driving, a rotationally symmetrical housing 
(2) which is connected to the axle (1) so that it rotates with it and which is at least 

partially liquid-permeable, an inlet element (9) for the fibre suspension and a first 
channel system (11) communicating with it, which system opens into an undivided 

annular displacement space (12) inside the housing (2), a second channel system (13) 
which leads from the displacement space (12) to an outlet element (14) for the fibre 

suspension, a fluid space (3) which encloses the outer periphery (2A) of the housing 
(2), a third channel system (5) which is connected to an inlet (6) for a fluid and which 

leads to the fluid space (3), and a fourth channel system (15) which connects at least 
one opening (15A), which has been arranged in a radial direction at a shorter distance 

from the axis of symmetry than the displacement space (3), with an outlet element 
(16) for withdrawal of fluid and of substance possibly separated from the suspension. 
device according to claim 10, 
characterized
 in that the second channel 
system (13) is limited outwards by an element (4C), which is at least partially 

rotationally symmetrical and which converges in the direction towards the outlet 
element (14).
