<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an external filtration device, 
particularly for aquariums and ornamental water tanks, which 

includes a container formed by a lower hollow part (2) that 
is closed at the top by a detachable lid (3) and internally 

accommodates a filtration chamber (6) and a pump (11) which 
are connected to the outside by an inlet connector (8) and 

an outlet connector (15). A priming suction chamber (18) is 
located upstream of the pressure chamber (12) of the pump 

(11) and downstream of the filtration chamber (6). The 
suction chamber (18) has a removable upper plug (25) and is 

connected to the pressure chamber (12) of the pump (11) by 
an horizontal passage (20) and to the filtration chamber (6) 

by a vertical duct (22). A discharge chamber (26) is located 
directly downstream of the pressure chamber (12) and is 

directly connected to the outlet connector (15). Safety 
hooks (27) engage the lid with the lower hollow part (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an external filtration 
device particularly for aquariums and ornamental water 
tanks, of the type including a hermetically closed container 
that internally accommodates a pump and a filtration chamber 
which are connected to the outside by a suction connector 
and a discharge connector. As is known, in devices of the above indicated type the 
suction and discharge connectors are generally connected to 
the tank of the liquid to be filtered by virtue of ordinary 
flexible hoses. These devices should open in order to allow periodic 
maintenance of the filter. Accordingly, such devices are 
generally composed of two parts that can be coupled 
hermetically by locking hooks or other manual closure 
devices. In some known devices, the container is formed by a lower 
cup-shaped part adapted to receive a filter cartridge and by 
an upper part or lid that encloses an electric pump together 
with the suction and discharge connectors. The pump can be 
arranged upstream or downstream of the filter component. In order to ensure pump startup, the pump must be primed by 
keeping the impeller constantly submerged, avoiding if 
possible the forming of air pockets in the ducts. In a known device provided with an upstream pump, the pump  
 
is located at the base of the container. This arrangement 
facilitates the priming of the pump but causes unfiltered 
liquid to flow through some of its internal components, with 
consequent greater wear and risk of seizing. Furthermore, 
the pump can be rather noisy, especially after an initial 
period of use. In another conventional device the pump is arranged 
downstream of the filtration component, for example built 
into the lid, and in order to prime the pump it is necessary 
to first of all fill the container with liquid and expel the 
air from the circuit. An example of such conventional device 
is shown in US-A-4,895,646 in which the priming means are 
provided by an external vacuum pump other than the water 
pump located in the lid. Both arrangements have drawbacks that compromise the 
durability and efficiency of the pump or the practicality 
and functionality of the device as a whole. An additional drawback of conventional external filtration 
devices arises from the components for closing the 
container, which are generally constituted by lever-like 
hooks. These components are in fact difficult to operate and 
do not have an easily identifiable open or closed position. 
This can cause unintentional opening of the device and 
therefore
