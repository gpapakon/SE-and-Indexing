<ABSTRACT>
An amplifier is described which has a two stage arrangement in which 
the second stage is pumped with the pump signal not used in the first stage. The 

amplified signal plus remaining pump energy from the first amplifier section 7 are 
passed to a multiplexer/demultiplexer 9 which separates off the signal into a loop 15 

which includes an interstage isolator 155 or 153. The signal and pump energy are 
then applied to the second amplifier stage 11. In one embodiment (FIG. 1), the 

signal, on completing the loop, is coupled to the second stage 11 by the 
multiplexer/demultiplexer. In another embodiment (FIG. 2), the second stage 11 is 

in the loop, so that the pump energy and the signal pass through in opposite 
directions, so that on completing the loop, the twice-amplified signal is coupled to 

the output. The interstage isolator in the loop reduces amplified spontaneous 
emission, thus improving gain/noise performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of optical amplifiers and 
particularly to the field of optical amplifiers using doped laser fiber amplifiers. The field of optical communications systems using optical fibers, 
although relatively new, is now well developed with many tens of thousands of 
optical fibers spanning millions of kilometers installed. An important consideration 
in the design of such systems is the distance the optical signal can travel through a 
fiber and still be reliably detected. The optical fibers attenuate the signals, and the 
first optical communication systems used repeaters to span long distances; signals 
are detected at the end of one fiber and then regenerated and launched into another 
fiber. The process is repeated as many times as necessary to span the desired 
distance. Repeaters, however, require complicated electronic systems to detect and 
regenerate the signals. A conceptually simpler system periodically amplifies the 
optical signal without necessarily regenerating it. Although many types of optical amplifiers have been studied and 
considered for use in optical communications systems, the most widely used at the 
present time is the rare earth doped fiber amplifier with erbium being the most 
commonly used dopant. When optically pumped at suitable power and wavelength, 
the doped fiber amplifies an incoming signal such as one with a commonly used 
wavelength such as approximately 1.3µm or 1.5µm. Such amplifiers are now well 
known in the art and need not be described in detail. The optical amplifier is, of course, subject to design constraints imposed 
by system considerations. For example, it should have both high gain and low noise 
for use in a practical system. It should also be easily implemented. Single stage 
amplifier configurations can not readily met these design constraints with respect to 
noise and gain. Backward and forward traveling amplified spontaneous emission 
(ASE) reduces the state of inversion of the fiber. This both decreases the gain and 
increases the noise figure. In a tandem amplifier, insertion of an isolator between the 
sections suppresses the backward traveling amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) 
and avoids degradation of the noise figure, but the gain is still limited. See, for 
example, Lumholt, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 4 , pp. 568-570, June 1992. 
Additionally, in a single stage amplifier, a significant amount of pump power leaves 
the active fiber and is wasted.  
 Accordingly, two stage designs using multiple
