<ABSTRACT>
A natural vitamin E preparation, i.e. vitamin E extracted from natural sources, 
comprising one or more of the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-tocopherol forms, either 

as the tocopherol itself, or as a derivative, such as the acetate, in which the total 
concentration of Wendt PAHs is less than 100 ppb.

<DESCRIPTION>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of compounds which are 
near ubiquitous in the environment. Some of these compounds are carcinogenic. They 
are produced in the course of many different types of industrial activity and are present 
in substantial amounts in the atmosphere. They are picked up by plants from the 
atmosphere and so, paradoxically, some of the foods which are regarded as healthy are 
the most contaminated. Wendt described the major PAHs likely to be present in foodstuffs and identified 
in particular 6 "light" and 7 "heavy" PAHs (see Table 1). The heavy PAHs are the ones 
which are most likely to be toxic. We produce vegetable oils and are concerned to ensure that PAH levels in 
products for sale are kept well within appropriate levels. Recently what is regarded as 
an unacceptable level of PAHs was found in a finished product to which had been added 
natural vitamin E. The PAH levels in the oil itself were well within acceptable limits. 
After a great deal of investigation of all possible sources of PAH contamination it was 
concluded that the excess PAH had been added in the natural vitamin E. This was 
surprising, since we had not previously known of any reports of PAH contamination of 
vitamin E. However, natural vitamin E comes from plant sources, usually soya or 
wheat, and is prepared by a series of concentration steps which could well concentrate 
the PAHs as well as the vitamin E. There are three major manufacturers of natural vitamin E in the world, and 
samples were obtained from all three. The samples were analysed for the 13 PAHs in 
the Wendt classification. The results are shown in Table 1 below. The Table sets out  
 
the 13 PAHs identified by Wendt as possible important contaminants of foods and their 
levels in commercial samples of d-alpha-tocopherol acetate supplied by three 
manufacturers. All figures are in ppb.

Total52636465560 As can be seen from Table 1, while the samples vary, they all contain 
unacceptably high levels of one or more PAHs. Thus natural vitamin E preparations,  
 
either used by themselves or added to other foods or food supplements, could prove to be 
significant sources of human PAH intake. The final end
