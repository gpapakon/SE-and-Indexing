<ABSTRACT>
Mirror, in particular rear view mirror for a vehicle, having a mirror surface (1) which is provided with a reflecting layer (5) and a non-scratch protective layer (4) on the surface facing the person (3) looking into the mirror. Between the mirror surface (1) and the reflecting layer (5) and/or between the reflecting layer and the non-scratch protective layer there is arranged an adhesive layer (2) which is essentially composed of a silicone jelly.

<CLAIMS>
A mirror comprising a mirror plate (1, 1') provided with a reflecting
layer (5, 5') and with a scratch-proof protective layer (4, 4') on the

surface facing the observer (3, 3'), a silicone adhesive layer (2, 2')
being disposed between the mirror plate (1) and the reflecting layer

(5), and/or between the reflecting layer (5') and the scratch-proof
protective layer (4'),
characterised in that
 the adhesive layer (2, 2') is substantially a
gel-like vulcanised silicone gel made from a two-component silicone

rubber.
A mirror according to claim 1, characterised in that the mirror plate
is substantially of thermoset plastics material or preferably

thermoplastic material, which is electrically conductive.
A mirror according to claim 2, characterised in that the mirror plate
(1, 1') is made substantially from polyphenylene sulphide (PPF).
A mirror according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
mirror plate (1, 1') is heatable, preferably by conduction, by a

heating device.
A mirror according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
reflecting layer (5) is applied to the back of the scratch-proof

protective layer (4) remote from the observer (3), and the said back

is an optical surface, e.g. polished.
A mirror according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
silicone gel adhesive layer (2') is disposed between the reflecting

layer (5') and the scratch-proof protective layer (4'), and an 
electrically insulating layer (6) is disposed between the mirror plate

(1') and the reflecting layer (5').
A mirror according to claim 6, characterised in that the electric
insulating layer (6) is a lacquer film or another adhesive layer made

substantially of silicone gel.
A mirror according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
reflecting layer (5, 5') is substantially made of Cr, Al or TiO
2
.
A mirror according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
scratch-proof protective layer (4) is a translucent layer of an

inorganic material, e.g. a thin glass or a thin-glass sheet, or an
organic material such as a scratch-proof coated
