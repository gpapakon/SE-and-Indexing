Gripping device for emptying refuse containers 
into a refuse collection vehicle, 


the gripping device (30) being equipped with two 
different holders (32, 46) for different types of containers 

(10, 20), and it being possible in each case to 
bring a specific holder into engagement with a specific 

container (10, 20) by a respectively different rotated or 
pivoted position of the holders (32, 46) on the gripping 

device (30),
 
characterized in that 
one holder (46) can be inserted into an undercut 
receptacle pocket (22) which is integrally moulded on the 

outer wall (14) of a first container (20) and the other 
holder (32) can be inserted in the manner of a comb 

beneath the upper turned-over rim (12) of a second 
container (10), 
these holders (32, 46) in the rest position of 
the gripping device can be moved into an upwardly 

directed position by turning, pivoting, folding, displacing 
or helically rotating them, in such a manner that 
the gripping device can in each case only be 
brought into engagement with one kind of containers (10, 

20). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that 


the two different holders (32, 46) are part of a 
holder body (40), 
this holder body (40) is mounted such that it can 
rotate about an axis (42), in that 
depending on the rotational position of the 
holder body (40) and thus of the holders (32, 46) in each 

case only one of the two different holders (32, 46) can 
be brought into engagement with a container (10, 20), 
this axis (42) is arranged essentially horizontally 
in the rest position of the gripping device. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that  

 

a positioning device (60), which can be used to 
limit the position for a specific type of container (20), 

is present on the gripping device (30). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that 


a bracket member (60, 72) is held adjustably on 
the gripping device (30), 
a spring member (66) is present, by means of 
which the bracket member (60, 72) can be adjusted into a 

first position, 
a trigger member (76), by means of which the 
bracket member (60, 72) can be adjusted into a second 

position counter to the force of the spring member (66), 
is present on the gripping device (30). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the trigger member (76) is present on the holder 

body (40) of the gripping device (30). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the holders (32, 36) and/or the 

gripping device is provided in a partially or completely 
exchangeable manner.
