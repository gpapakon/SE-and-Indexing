<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (15) for making insert pockets or book covers has a machine frame (14), in which a welding punch (16) is movably guided. Opposite the welding punch (16) there is a sonotrode arrangement (17), in order to weld the films forming the book covers or insert pockets between the welding punch (16) and the sonotrode arrangement (17) in a way corresponding to the contour of the covers or pockets. Furthermore, a description is given of a welding punch (16), the contours of which are designed such that the profile is open on both sides, with respect to the running direction of the articles to be produced. In this way, the limit between two successive insert pockets lies within the pattern of welded edges. As a result, wastage of film between successive insert pockets or book covers is avoided.
