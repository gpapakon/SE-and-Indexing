<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ionic cis-triamino 
platinum (II) complexes of general formula I 
[(am)2 Pt H2N-R Cl]+ Cl- (HCl)n (H2O)m 
wherein: 
am is an amino monodentate ligand selected from the 
group consisting of NH3, straight or branched C1-C5 
alkylamine, straight or branched C1-C3 dialkylamine, 
cyclopropylamine, cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine; or 
both am groups, taken together, from a bidentate amino 
ligand selected from the group consisting of a C2-C8 
alkyl-1,2-diamine or a straight or cyclic C3-C8 alkyl-1,3-diamine; R is a group of formula p-NH2-C6H4-CO-X-(CH2)2-NRaRb 
where X is selected from the group consisting of O, NH 
and CH2, Ra and Rb, which are the same or different, 
are each a straight or branched C1-C4 alkyl and n and 
m, independently each other, are 0 or 1. Further objects of the present invention are a 
process for the preparation of compounds of formula I 
and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. A straight or branched C1-C5 alkylamine is preferably 
propylamine, isopropylamine, n-pentylamine. A straight or branched C1-C3 dialkylamine is preferably 
diisopropylamine. A straight C2-C8 alkyl-1,2-diamine is preferably 
1,2-ethylenediamine or 1,2-butanediamine (1-, d-, dl-or 
meso). A cycloaliphatic C3-C8 alkyl-1,2-diamine is preferably  
 
1,2-cyclopentanediamine (1-, d-, dl- or meso), 
1,2-cyclohexanediamine (1-, d-, dl- or meso) or 1,2-cycloheptanediamine 
(1-, d-, dl- or meso). A straight C3-C8 alkyl-1,3-diamine is preferably 
1,3-propylenediamine. A cyclic C3-C8 alkyl-1,3-diamine is preferably 
1,1-bis-aminomethylcyclopentane or 1,1-bis-aminomethyl-cyclohexane. The most particularly preferred ligand am is the 
monodentate ligand NH3; said amino monodentate ligands 
am are specifically cis-oriented with respect to the Pt 
atom. Ra and Rb are preferably both ethyl. X is preferably O. When n is the integer 1, the compounds of the 
invention are addition salts, when m is the integer 1, 
the compounds of the invention are solvates and contain 
a molecule of crystallization water. A particularly preferred compound of the invention 
is cis-diamino-chloro-4-[diethylammoniumethoxycarbonyl 
phenyl]amino-platinum (II)+ bis-chloride monohydrate. Antitumor platinum triamine complexes 
containing aniline or substituted aniline as a ligand 
are disclosed in EP-A-0409528 (23-1-1991) whereas J. 
Nat. Cancer Inst., 1990, 82(2), 677-84, discloses 
mixtures of diamino dichloro platinum with procaine 
hydrochloride. The compounds of the invention of formula I are 
obtained
