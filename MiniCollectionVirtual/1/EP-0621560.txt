<ABSTRACT>
Information-dispensing installation (1, 1') for supplying 
information to customers, at least provided with an information-dispensing 

unit (2) for issuing to the customers vouchers (59; 71, 
72, 73) on which the said information is shown, which installation 

also comprises printer facilities (30, 31) for printing the information 
on the vouchers (59; 71, 72, 73), which printer facilities 

(30, 31) comprise at least a reprogrammable memory (34 or 35 or 36) 
for storing the information, and the installation (1, 1') being 

provided with input means (9, 12, 13, 14, 15), which can be coupled 
to the reprogrammable memory (34 or 35 or 36), for entering the 

information in the reprogrammable memory (34 or 35 or 36); in one

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an information-dispensing installation 
for supplying information to customers, at least provided with 
an information-dispensing unit for issuing to the customers 
vouchers on which the said information is shown, printer facilities 
to print information on the vouchers, the printer facilities comprising 
at least reprogrammable memory means to store the information, 
input means connectable to the reprogrammable memory means 
and to input the information to the reprogrammable memory means. Such an installation is known from United States Patent 
5,176,224. The voucher issued by the known system entitles the 
customer who receives the voucher to a discount on a predetermined 
product for sale in a supermarket or other retail establishment. 
The computer controllable printer facilities includes a panel having 
a set of electronic displays which are controlled by the manufacturer 
of the product. The electronic displays are able to indicate 
the products for which discount vouchers are available. Moreover, 
further displays are provided to show the actual discount per 
product. Besides, the panel includes several push-buttons to be 
operated by the customers. Operation of a push-button causes the 
printer facilities to print a discount voucher for the product 
related to that push-button and causes a dispenser to discharge the 
new printer voucher. Since the panel comprises several push-buttons 
and several displays to show different sets of information the 
known system may form a bar to be used by people, especially older 
people, who are not able to or not used to operate electronic systems. 
Moreover, no voucher is available for a customer passing by 
the system: each customer first has to push a button before he may 
receive a voucher. This time delay may form a bar to the use of the 
known system by people entering the supermarket in a hurry or may 
cause a waiting queue to occur. Another information-dispensing installation is known from 
European Patent Application 0,086,199. The purpose of the installation 
disclosed in this publication is to make it possible for, for 
example, the customers of a bank to select a specifically desired 
service window, for example dealing with mortgages only, with the 
aid of a sequence number system. To this end the known installation  
 
comprises at least one sequence number allocating unit, operator 
terminals for staff, a display unit for displaying the sequence 
number next in turn for service, a selection unit provided with a 
large

Information-dispensing installation for supplying information 
to customers, at least provided with 


an information-dispensing unit (2) for issuing to customers 
vouchers (59; 71, 72, 73) on which the said information is shown; 
printer facilities (30, 31) to print information on the 
vouchers, the printer facilities comprising at least reprogrammable 

memory means (34, 35, or 36) to store the information, 
input means (9, 12, 13, 14, 15) connectable to the 
reprogrammable memory means and to input the information to the 

reprogrammable memory means,
 
   characterized by 
detector means (57) to detect the presence of a voucher in 
a predetermined location where it can be taken away by customers 

and to generate a detection signal for the printer facilities (30, 
31) when the voucher is taken away, wherein the printer facilities 

(30, 31) are arranged to print a new voucher and to supply the new 
voucher to the predetermined location upon receipt of the detection 

signal. 
Information-dispensing installation according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the input means (9, 12, 13, 14, 15) comprise

which can be connected to the interface (9) via a cable (11), which 
interface (9) comprises at least one reprogrammable memory for 

storing the information to be given on the vouchers and the time 
and dates when the information has to be shown, and which interface 

can be disconnected with the aid of connectors (8, 8′).
