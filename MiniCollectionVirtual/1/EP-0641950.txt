<ABSTRACT>
A caliper brake set engages a brake disk (4) on a 
machine shaft or drive sheave (6) to hold an elevator 

car in place at a landing. Brake shoes (20) are mounted 
on brake arms (16) pivoted about pins (18), and are 

urged into contact with disk (14) by a spring (28). 
Latch (10) includes a solenoid (36), plunger (38) and 

levers (42). Movement of the plunger (38) from an 
extended to a recessed position causes upturned fingers 

(43) of the levers (42) to contact the brake arms (16) 
and compress the spring (28) to lift the brake shoes 

(20) from the disk (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved brake 
assembly for use in holding an elevator car at a 
landing, which is also operable to stop the car under 
emergency conditions, as in a power failure or 
overspeed. More particularly, this invention relates to 
a caliper brake assembly for engagement with a disk 
secured to the elevator machine shaft or drive sheave to 
hold the latter against rotation. Disk brakes which act upon a disk secured to an 
elevator machine shaft to hold the elevator car in place 
at landings are known in the prior art. Disk brakes in 
the prior art which have been adapted for elevator use 
have been full plate disk brakes wherein the brake shoes 
are operable to engage the periphery of the disk to hold 
the car in place. Full plate disk brakes may be prone 
to dirt and moisture problems, and are not amenable to 
solenoid stroke variations due to their mode of 
operation. They are also noisy due to the difficulty in 
controlling motion in the relatively short stroke of the 
flat faced armature. A disk brake is also known from DE-A-2646736 for 
use with handling equipment, such as travelling cranes, 
in which the disk is braked by a pair of opposed pads 
mounted on sprung levers and actuated by an 
electromagnet. This invention relates to a disk brake assembly for 
use in an elevator system wherein the disk brakes are 
caliper-type brakes which are operative to engage a 
brake disk mounted on the machine shaft or drive sheave 
to hold the car in place at landings. More 
particularly, the disk brake assembly of this invention 
comprises: 
a) a pair of brake shoes mounted on an associated 
pair of brake arms, the brake shoes having  
 
opposed braking surfaces; b) a brake disk interposed between the brake 
shoes, the brake disk having opposite side 
surfaces facing respective ones of the braking 
surfaces;  
   and 
c) spring means which act on the brake arms to 
bias the brake shoes toward each other; characterised in that the assembly 
further comprises d) latching means including: 
i) a pair of pivotally mounted levers for 
engagement with the brake arms to hold 
the latter against the bias of the spring 
means; and ii) solenoid latch actuating means including 
a solenoid plunger operably engaging the 
levers to selectively hold the latter 
against the brake arms, the plunger being 
reciprocally movable between latch-on and 
latch-off positions to selectively latch 
and release the brake arms. The association of a latching solenoid and plunger 
with levers that engage with the brake
