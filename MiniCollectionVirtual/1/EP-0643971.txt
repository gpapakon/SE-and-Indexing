<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides, among others, a method of 
increasing the sensitivity of a fungal cell to an antifungal 

agent by administering an antifungal agent in combination with a 
potentiating agent. The invention also provides a method of 

testing for the ability of an agent to potentiate the activity 
of an antifungal compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The incidence of serious, life-threatening, fungal 
infections is increasing at an alarming rate. The number of 
Candida albicans bloodstream infections in non-teaching 
hospitals increased by 370% between 1980 and 1990. At the 
same time the incidence of bloodstream infections by C. 
albicans in teaching hospitals increased by 487% in the same 
time period. With the exception of coagulase negative 
staphylococci, statistically, C. albicans represents the 
fastest growing area of concern in hospital acquired 
bloodstream infections (Banerjee et al., 1991, American 
Journal of Medicine 91(3B):86S-89S). The rising incidence of nosocomial fungal infections is 
being fueled by changing medical practices, including 
invasive surgical procedures addressing such problems as 
joint replacement and open heart surgery, increased use of 
cancer chemotherapy, and the AIDS epidemic. All of these 
processes compromise the immune system and provide an 
environment in which fungal infections can be established. Approximately 90% of nosocomial fungal infections are 
represented by species of Candida. The remaining fungal 
infections are for the most part comprised of Aspergillus 
species, Cryptococcus species, and Pneumocystis carrinii. 
Unfortunately, diagnosis of fungal infections is difficult 
and time consuming. Rather than waiting for the results of 
diagnostic tests, empirical antifungal therapy must 
frequently be initiated with a compound such as amphotericin 
B (which has a high toxicity liability) or one of the azoles 
(to which fungal species are rapidly developing resistance). 
Thus, having an antifungal with a broad spectrum of activity 
coupled with a low toxicity profile would be very desirable.  The discovery and development of antifungal compounds 
for specific fungal species has met with some degree of 
success. Because Candida species represent the majority of 
fungal infections, screens for new antifungal compounds have 
been designed to discover anti-Candida compounds. During 
product development, anti-fungal activity has generally been 
optimized based on activity against Candida albicans. As a 
consequence, these anti-Candida compounds frequently do not 
possess clinically significant activity against other fungal 
species. However, it is interesting to note that at higher 
concentrations some of these compounds are able to kill other 
fungal species, suggesting that the antifungal target is 
present in these organisms as well. In retrospect, such 
results indicate that these organisms possess
