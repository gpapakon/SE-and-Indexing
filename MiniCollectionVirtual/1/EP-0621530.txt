<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a printing system for producing prints from a print job written in
one of a plurality of page description languages with the print job assuming the form of a print

job stream (20). The printing system includes a plurality of page description language
analyzing units (202) for sampling the print job stream, each analyzing unit outputting an

information signal (I
0
....I
n
) which provides information regarding the print job stream. A filter
(204), which receives the information signals, processes the information signals and outputs a

filtered signal which indicates the page description language in which the print job is written.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a printing system and, more particularly, to a
technique which facilitates the interpretation of a print job written in a page description language by
determining the page description language in which the print job is written.Personal computers have become commonplace on the desks of most office workers.
Typically, much of the work product of such computers is intended to be transformed into hardcopy
via a printer using digital imaging technology.Xerox® Corporation presently is marketing a server for a printing apparatus, the server
being referred to as the DocuTech® Network Server ("DocuTech Network Server" is a trademark of
Xerox Corp.) This server is adapted to translate a job written in a first page description language
("PDL"), such as Postscript® ("PS") or Hewlett Packard Printer Control Language ("HP-PCL"), into
a second PDL, such as Interpress, for printing of the job on a Xerox® compatible printing
apparatus. At the heart of the server are two interpreters, one of which is adapted to translate PS
and the other of which is adapted to translate HP-PCL. Each interpreter contains software, written
by either Adobe® Systems Inc. or Peerless® Corp. to facilitate the translation process.A PDL is a method of describing printed page(s) in a printer independent format. A PDL
establishes an interface between a print driver or client and a print server or printer. The following

1990As is noted in art cited above, the control of, and software for, printers in a system or
network environment can be in the printer itself. Commonly, however, a major part of the system
printer integration software operation may be in the print server connected into the system,
(typically a stand alone but dedicated small computer or PC). The server typically functions as a
"spooler" to buffer the jobs that are sent to it, as well as a page description language (PDL) 
"decomposer", for converting the PDL files (e.g., "Interpress™" or "PostScript®") to bitmapped files
for application to the printer.The electronic printing standard includes a specific set of instructions for printing in a
standard for representing documents digitally. The Interpress™ standard for representing printed
pages is supported by a wide range of Xerox® Corporation other

<CLAIMS>
A printing system for producing prints from a print job written in one of a
plurality of page description languages with the print job assuming a form of a print job

stream, the system comprising:

an input source for generating the print job and transmitting the print job stream;
a plurality of page description language analyzing units (202) for sampling the
print job stream, each analyzing unit (202) outputting an information signal which

provides information regarding the print job stream; and
a filter (204), receiving each of the information signals, for processing the
information signals and outputting a filtered signal which indicates the page description

language in which the print job is written;
characterized in that

   said filter (204) is programmable and includes criteria for the processing of the
information signals, and

   said input source includes means for over-riding one of the criteria.
A printing system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a print server
(25) for interpreting the page description language of the print job to prepare the print job

for printing, and wherein said server (25) includes means for over-riding one of the
criteria.
A printing system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the print job stream
includes an operator representative of the page description language in which the print

job is written, wherein one of the information signals indicates the presence of the
representative operator in the image data stream.
A printing system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the print job stream
includes a plurality of operators
 representative of the page description language in which 
the print job is written and sets of selected operators follow a distribution, wherein a

certainty factor, varying as a function of the distribution, is outputted from one of said
page description language analyzing units (202).
A printing system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the page description
language of the print job possesses a characteristic signature recognized by one of said

page description language analyzing units (202), wherein said one of said page
description language analyzing units (202) translates the characteristic signature into one

of the information signals.
A printing system as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further
comprising a binary filter, sampling the print job stream and communicating with said

filter, for providing said filter with an indication of the percentage of binary characters in
the print job to prevent erroneously indicating that the print job is written predominantly in

one page description language when it is written predominantly in another page
description language.
A method of determining a page description language of a print job, the
print job being written in one of a plurality of page description languages and assuming a

form of a print job stream, comprising the steps of:

communicating (208) the print job stream to a plurality of page description
language analyzing units;
generating (218) a plurality of information signals from the plurality of page
description language analyzing units, each of the information signals providing

information regarding the print job stream;
transmitting (222) the information signals to a filter; and
processing (224) the information signals with the filter for generating a filtered
signal that indicates the page description language in which the print job is written;
characterized in that

   said processing step (224) includes processing the information signals with
selected criteria,

   further comprising the step of transmitting a signal to the filter for over-riding one
of the criteria. 
A method as claimed in claim 7, in which the selected criteria is part of a
configuration file, further comprising the step of programming the configuration file.
A method as claimed in claim 7 or 8, in which the page description
language is 
characterized by
 an operator, wherein said generating step (218) includes
providing one of the plurality of information signals with a certainty factor for indicating

the frequency of occurrence of the operator in the print job.
A method as claimed in claim 7 or 8, in which the page description
language is one of a plurality of versions, further comprising the step of indicating, with

the certainty factor, which one of the plurality of versions is present in the print job
stream.
A method as claimed in claim 7 or 8, in which the page description
language is 
characterized by
 a signature, wherein said generating step includes
indicating, with one of the information signals, the presence of the signature.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 11, in which the print job
includes a plurality of characters, further comprising the step of informing the filter of the

percentage of binary characters in the print job so that the filter can determine accurately
the page description language of the print job.
