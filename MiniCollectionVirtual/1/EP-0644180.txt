<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
purifying a polar vinyl compound such as N-vinylcarboxamides.
More particularly, it is concerned with
a process for obtaining a highly purified polar vinyl
compound from a mixture of a polar vinyl compound,
impurities such as polymerisation inhibiting substances and
starting materials used in preparation of the polar vinyl
compound, that is, from a polar vinyl compound containing
impurities (hereinafter referred to as "crude polar vinyl
compound").A wide variety of useful polymers are obtained by
polymerizing a vinyl compound through an addition
polymerization, e.g., a radical, a cationic or an anionic
polymerization. This polymerization proceeds through a
chain reaction, so that, when the vinyl compound contains
chain terminating or chain transferring compounds as formed
during the production of the vinyl compound, adverse
effects are caused such as retardation of the
polymerization reaction and decrease of the molecular
weight of the obtained polymer. Many of these
polymerization inhibiting substances give adverse effect on 
the polymerization reaction even if their amount is very
small. Therefore, it is needed to completely eliminate the
above polymerization inhibiting substances, for imparting
excellent polymerizability (polymerization activity) to the
vinyl compound.A polymerization inhibitor is often added to a vinyl
compound having a radical polymerization activity during or
after the production thereof in order to inhibit the
polymerization during the production, storage and
transportation. Therefore, although a polymerization
initiator is often added in an amount sufficient to
countervail the effect of the polymerization inhibitor in
the polymerization of the vinyl compound, it is preferred
that the polymerization inhibitor be removed from the vinyl
compound prior to the polymerization, for obtaining a
polymer of high quality.However, it is often difficult to remove the
polymerization inhibitor and other polymerization
inhibiting substances from a vinyl compound containing an
oxygen, a nitrogen or a sulfur atom, i.e., a vinyl compound
having a polar group (polar vinyl compound). When the
polar vinyl compound is purified by distillation, it is
generally required to withdraw the same in vacuum and
simultaneously at a temperature not lower than the melting
point thereof because the boiling and melting points of the
polar vinyl compound are relatively high, so that the
operating conditions of the distillation are often 
extremely restrained. Further,
