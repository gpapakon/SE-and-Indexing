<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a semiconductor memory with a built-in 
parallel bit test mode, which has a special test mode 

for pre-die sort that can output redundancy data and 
perform a parallel test on a plurality of bits for each 

cell array. The semiconductor memory comprises a memory 
circuit including memory cell arrays (11) formed on a 

semiconductor chip area and laid out as a plurality of 
blocks, the memory circuit having a redundancy function 

for allowing each memory cell array to be saved independently 
by spare rows (112) or spare columns (113), a 

first test circuit, provided in the memory circuit, for 
writing the same data to a plurality of bits of memory 

cells in the memory circuit and simultaneously reading 
the data from the plurality of bits to determine whether 

or not each piece of the simultaneously read data 
matches with each other to thereby perform a parallel 

test on a plurality of bits in a first parallel bit test 
mode specified when the semiconductor chip area is 

sealed in a package or is in a wafer state, and a second 
test circuit, provided in the memory circuit, for performing 

a parallel test on a plurality of bits of memory 
cells in the memory circuit with a degree of reduction 

of bits, less than a reduced number of bits of data read 
in the first parallel bit test mode, in a second 

parallel bit test mode specified when the semiconductor 
chip area is in a wafer state. Those bits reduced in 

the second parallel bit test mode are included in a unit 
of redundancy replacement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory and, more particularly, to a semiconductor memory
with a built-in parallel bit test mode.Recent dynamic semiconductor memories (DRAMs) have
a parallel bit test mode for performing a parallel test
of a plurality of bits in order to shorten the test
time.This parallel bit test mode is to access a plurality
of bits of a DRAM even with a x1 bit structure,
instead of performing writing/reading one bit at a time
to test the memory function bit by bit, or to access
more bits than the number of inputs/outputs (I/O) for a
DRAM with a multi-bit structure, thereby testing the
functions of many bits simultaneously. That is, this
test mode simultaneously writes the same data in n-bit
memory cells, simultaneously reads the n-bit data in
read mode to determine if each piece of data matches
with each other, and outputs "1" or "0" in accordance
with the matched/unmatched result.This parallel bit test mode can reduce the number
of cycles to access all the bits to 1/n (n: the number
of bits) and can significantly shorten the test time.An 8-bit parallel bit test mode that was standardized
in JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering
Council) has been implemented in a 4M DRAM with a structure
of 4M words × 1 bit to which the parallel bit test 
mode was introduced first.As the degree of the integration of DRAMs was
increased, the number of bits to be simultaneously
tested in parallel bit test mode was also increased to
minimize an increase in test time. It is the current
tendency of the individual makers to implement a 16-bit
parallel mode in 16M DRAMs with a structure of
16M words × 1 bit and implement a 32-bit parallel mode
in 64M DRAMs.In discriminating the test result of a DRAM having
a structure of 64M words x 1 bit, for example, 32-bit
data is read simultaneously, the discrimination result
is output to the output pad, and "1" is output if 32
bits are all "0" or "1", or "0" is output if 32 bits contain
both "0" and "1."This discrimination method can ensure a 32-bit
parallel test for checking if the writing/reading of
cells can be performed correctly, thus greatly shortening
the test time.For devices with a multi-bit structure, which
have an output pad as wide as the bit width, it is
typical to employ a method for collectively outputting
the results of the test for the entire to-be-tested
bits to specific I/O terminals, as mentioned above, not
outputting the results of discrimination on the
properness/defectiveness of a subset of cells of a cell
array to the
