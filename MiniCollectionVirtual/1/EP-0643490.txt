<ABSTRACT>
Method of compressing an incoming flow of hexadecimal digital values {0, 1, 2 ... 9, A, B, ... F} being presented in the form of a series of source bytes each containing the coded digital value {'0', '1', '2', ... '9', 'A', 'B', ... 'F'} obtained according to a code capable of coding a set of characters, each of the coded characters obtained according to this code being formed by high-order bits common to certain characters and by low-order bits specific to this character, and the said coded hexadecimal digital values not all having the same high-order bits, characterised by the stages consisting in:   (a) for each source byte (O1, O2, ... Oi, ... On), transposing some of the said coded digital values into other coded characters so as to obtain the same high-order bits, (b) extracting the four lowest-order bits (Oib3, Oib2, Oib1, Oib0) of each of the bytes obtained at stage (a) in order to give a quartet (I) representing, in a one-to-one way, the corresponding initial hexadecimal digital value; and (c) concatenating the successive quartets obtained at stage (c) in order to give resulting coded bytes (O'1, O'2, ... O'i, ... O'm), fewer in number (m) than that (n) of the source bytes.
