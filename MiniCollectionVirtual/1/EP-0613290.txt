<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for binary image coding, and particularly to a
method and an apparatus for data compression to be executed
with reference to mixed binary images including
documents, paintings, calligraphic works, diagrams,
halftone images and photographs.An MH (Modified Huffman) coding method or an MR
(Modified READ, Modified Relative Element Address Designate)
coding method applied in the G3 facsimile industry
is known as a typical coding method for binary images in
which each pixel is represented by numeral 0 or 1. These
methods are established by CCITT (Comité Consultatif
Internationale de Télégraphique et Téléphonique, International
Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee) as
international standards. Although the MH coding and the
MR coding are suitable for use in facsimile transmission
of business documents, their function is not satisfactory
for executing the high definition transmission of mixed
binary images which includes text, diagrams, halftone
images or photographs, and is not appropriate for displaying
images on the user's terminal when it is necessary 
in such operations as image data base retrieval.Therefore, a JBIG (Joint Bi-Level Image coding experts
Group) method has been proposed for a coding system
as an international standard which deals with binary
static image data and which can encode the data with a
high compression rate even when the data includes mixed
texts, diagrams, halftone images or photographs, and can
also perform the progressive display on the user's terminal.
A binary image data compression apparatus according
to the JBIG coding method is composed of, in brief, a
modeling part for performing modeling activity according
to the binary Markov model which refers to 10 pixels surrounding
a current pixel to be encoded and an encoder for
performing entropy encoding. As for entropy encoding, an
arithmetic encoding method is employed. It was decided to
use a QM code (hereinafter referred to as the QM-Code)
developed based on the Q code and Mel code as a standard
code. The JBIG method will be further described below
with reference to Figs. 1 and 2.Fig. 1 illustrates a conventional binary image data
compression apparatus according to the JBIG method. The
figure shows the input binary image scanning in progress
by a raster scanning method which scans the image pixel
by pixel from the upper left of the image. In Fig. 1,
xi,j represents a pixel (attentional pixel) to be inputted
to the j-th place on the i-th line. This apparatus
