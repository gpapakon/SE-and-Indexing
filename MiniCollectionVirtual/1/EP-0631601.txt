<DESCRIPTION>
Curable compositions containing epoxy and 
polyamide resins are known in the art. For example, 
EP-A-0157478 
describes adhesive compositions prepared by mixing solid 
particles of polyamide resins with solid particles of 
epoxy resins. If desired, the composition also contains a 
polymeric binder. Prior to application as an adhesive, 
the polyamide and epoxy composition is preferably 
dispersed in a non-solvent. Hastings et al., US-A-3945964, 
describes stable aqueous emulsions of epoxy resins 
containing, as emulsifying agents, ethylene oxide 
propylene oxide block polymers of specified formulae. 
Curing agents described as useful with the epoxy resin 
emulsion include polyamides. Aelony et al., US-A-2899397, 
describes mixed aqueous emulsions of polyamide and epoxy 
resins prepared by mixing a solution of epoxy resinous 
material with a solution of polymeric polyamides, 
combining the two solutions in the presence of an aqueous 
medium containing a water soluble organic carboxylic acid 
and agitating the combined solutions to produce an 
emulsion.  
 DE-A-1955008 is directed to mixed dispersions 
of polyamide and epoxy resins and methods for their 
preparation. The dispersions are disclosed as being 
rendered stable by incorporating therein an aralkyl 
diquaternary ammonium compound, for example, N-9(10)-phenyloctadecyl-N,N,N',N',N'-pentamethyl 
trimethylene 
diquaternary ammonium chloride. The Derwent abstract of JP-A-59-230074 is 
directed to carpet lining adhesive compositions 
containing (a) a high molecular weight dispersion, 
for example, general latex for carpet lining 
treatment, such as methyl methacrylate butadiene 
copolymer rubber latex, (b) a filler, for example, 
calcium carbonate, and (c) an amino acid, for 
example, glycine. One problem with many of the prior art 
epoxy/polyamide resin compositions, however, is the 
rapid reactivity of the mixed resins, producing in a 
relatively short amount of time an infusible, 
insoluble composition.  
 Where such compositions are intended for use as laminating 
agents, adhesives, potting and casting resins, and the 
like, this brief reaction time requires that the resin 
mixture be prepared at point of use and in relatively 
small quantities. Attempts have been made to lengthen the 
shelf life of these compositions, however, such attempts 
have met with little success. In addition, relatively 
large amounts of volatile organic solvents used in these 
processes (i.e. toluene, isopropanol, methylethyl ketone) 
are flammable and environmentally
