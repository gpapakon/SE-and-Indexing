<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polymer support with highly 
accessible reactive groups encompassed in a meshed fabric 
onto which desired functional groups or metals can be 
attached, a functionalized polymer support and a process 
for its preparation. The invention further relates to a 
product useful as an intermediate for the preparation of 
the polymer support. A polymer support in the form of a felt-bag is extremely 
easy to handle and can further be functionalized for 
tailored applications, e.g. for use as a polymer support 
for reagents and catalysts in organic reactions and 
reactive separations. The most advantageous feature of a 
polymer support in the form of a felt-bag is the ease of 
separation: The felt-bag can manually be removed from a 
reaction solution, which stays free from suspended catalyst 
particles during and after the reactions. Furthermore, the 
felt-bag can be prepared in several forms and with desired 
amounts of loaded reagent, which is very important for use 
in organic syntheses. A polymer supported reagent prepared 
in this way is especially suitable for use in batch 
applications e.g. in small-scale laboratory work, but it 
can also preferably be used in continuous flow processes. The idea of using polymers as supports for catalysts has 
been known since the late 1950's and the polymers used as 
supports have mainly been crosslinked polystyrene or 
polyvinylpyridine based materials. Reagents supported on 
crosslinked polymer matrices have many advantages compared 
with low-molecular weight species, like ease of separation, 
reuse of catalysts, adaptability to continuous flow 
processes, reduced toxicity and odor. The main  
 
disadvantages with these crosslinked reagents are higher 
cost, lower reactivity due to diffusional limitations and 
greater difficulty of analysis of the supported species and 
impurities. Furthermore, they are mostly in the form of 
powders which always have to be filtered from the reaction 
media (Hodge, P., Sherrington, D. C., (Eds.), Synthesis and 
separations using functional polymers, John Wiley & Sons, 
New York, (1988); Ford, W. T., (Ed.), Polymeric reagents 
and catalysts, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, 
(1986)). A polymer support used in a particular application should 
fulfill a number of important functions simultaneously. 
First, the support must possess the correct mechanical 
properties. For example, in column or batch applications, 
supports must be mechanically strong to resist compression 
and fraction into fine
