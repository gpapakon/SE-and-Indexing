 DRUG SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR HIV THYMOCYTE DEPLETIONINTRODUCTION Technical Field The field of this invention is the screening of drugs and treatment for HIV.BackgroundThe Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a serious and expanding pandemic. While extraordinary efforts have been made to find ways to protect humans from its etiologic agent, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) , to date there has been little other than palliative treatments available. For the most part, drugs have been directed to slowing the intractable course of the disease and to treating various of the opportunistic infections which often accompany it.It is recognized that a major consequence of infection with HIV is the substantial loss of "helper" T-cells, which are identified by the CD4 marker. In the normal ratio, helper T-cells are a substantially larger population than "suppressor/cytotoxic" T-cells, which are CD8+. During the course of the disease this ratio is reversed and ultimately there are substantially no helper T-cells in the external circulation. As a result, full-blown AIDS occurs as an inevitably fatal disease.There is therefore substantial interest in identifying procedures which may substantially slow the disease, or therapies where long-term maintenance may be achieved while 

allowing the diseased patient to carry on substantially normal functions.Relevant LiteratureStudies of the progression and treatment of HIV infection and AIDS can be found in Ameisen, J.C. and Capron, A., Immunology Today, (1991) , 12:102-105; Yarchoan, R. , et al., Blood, (1991), 78:859-884; McCune, J.M. , et al., Science, (1990), 247:564-566; Yarchoan, R. , et al . , New Engl.
