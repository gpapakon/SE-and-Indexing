<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is disclosed for filtering slurries of minerals or other fine particles. The apparatus includes a filter plate (8) having a microporous metal filtration layer with a filtration surface (14) overlying a support layer. The apparatus includes a device for drawing a partial vacuum across the filter plate (8) to form a filter cake (22) on said filter and plate (8) at a cake forming station (Fig. 3(a)). The device further includes structure to move the filter plate (8) containing the cake to a drying station (Fig. 3(b)), a cake discharge station (Fig. 3(c)) and a cake cleaning station (Fig. 3(d)). At the cake discharge station a device for applying pulsed fluid to backwash the filter plate (8) is employed along with vibrations (26) to dislodge the filter cake (22) from the filter plate (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
 I APPARATUS FOR FILTERING MINERAL SLURRIESBACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to apparatus for filtering fine particles from a liquid carrier and more specifically relates to an improved apparatus for dewatering aqueous slurries of very fine particle size minerals, including industrial minerals such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonates, and the like, as well as slurries of fine particle size coal, metalliferous ores, and the like.In the course of processing numerous minerals, a step of dewatering by filtration is commonly utilized. Such a requirement may be exemplified by considering the processing of crude industrial minerals such as kaolin clays and ground calcium carbonates, where the crude materials are commonly subjected to a series of steps intended to remove undesired impurities such as discolorants, so as to ultimately provide a refined product which is susceptible to the particular use for which it is intended. In the instance, for example, of kaolins, such beneficiation may in some instances be accomplished by dry processing techniques, as for example by air flotation. More commonly, however, especially where the impurities or contaminants to be removed are in some manner chemically combined or intimately associated with the mineral, wet processes of various types are employed. These include such well-known processes as froth flotation, reductive and oxidative bleaching, and high intensity magnetic separation. This is in addition to wet classification, which can also be regarded as a beneficiation step achieving some of the aforementioned objectives.Thus, in a typical procedure wherein the initial starting material is a crude sedimentary kaolin clay, including 

from about 1-2% titania, the said crude may be subjected to a separation process to reduce the titania content to below 0.8% by weight. More generally, the titania will be reduced to the range of from about 0.2 to 0.8. Where a froth flotation process is used for such purposes, the clay may be initially blunged and conditioned by forming an aqueous alkaline dispersion of the clay (pH adjusted to about 7-10 with ammonium hydroxide) . The dispersion may include as a deflocculating agent various compounds known to be useful for such purposes, such as sodium silicate. Other useful agents include a water-soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid or polymethacr lic acid preferably having an average molecular weight in the range of from about 500-10,000. Oleic acid or other collector agent is added during the conditioning process.
