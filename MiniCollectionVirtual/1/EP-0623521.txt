<ABSTRACT>
A protective transparent holder (10), consisting of two tubular parts (10.1, 10.2) which are closed at their one end in each case apart from ventilation openings (12) and which are designed to be pushed one inside the other in the region of their other and open ends to close the protective holder (10), at least one of the two parts (10.1) of the protective holder (10) being made from an elastically deformable plastic material and being provided, in its overlap region (13) with the other protective-holder part (10.2), with at least one catch projection (14) or one catch opening for a catch projection of the other holder part (10.2).

<CLAIMS>
A transparent protective case, particularly for toothbrushes, consisting of two tubular 
parts which are each closed at one end except for ventilation apertures, and which are 

constructed at their other, open ends so that they can slide within one another in order 
to close the protective case, characterised in that at least one of the two parts (10.1) 

of the protective case (10) is manufactured from an elastically deformable plastic 
material so as to form a flexible wall, and is provided in its region of overlap (13) 

with the other protective case part (10.2) with at least one locking projection (14) or 
with a locking aperture (15) for a locking projection of the other protective case part 

(10.1, 10.2). 
A transparent protective case according to claim 1, characterised in that the protective 
case part (10.1, 10.2) which is provided with an elastically flexible wall is provided 

with a locking projection (14) or a locking aperture on each of two mutually opposite 
sides. 
A transparent protective case according to claim 1, characterised in that at least the 
protective case part (10.1, 10.2) which is provided with an elastically flexible wall 

is manufactured from polypropylene. 
A transparent protective case according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the at least one locking projection (14) of the locking closure consists of a 

locking tab, which runs transversely to the longitudinal axis (L) of the protective case 
(10), which is formed on one of the two protective case parts (10.1), the longitudinal 

edge (14/1) of which which faces the protective case aperture (16.1) is bevelled and 
the other longitudinal edge (14/2) of which is of sharp-edged construction, and that 

a matching rectangular locking aperture (15) in the other protective case part (10.2) 
is associated with the locking tab (14).  

 
A transparent protective case according to claim 4, characterised in that both 
protective case parts (10,1, 10.2) are manufactured from elastically deformable plastic 

material and the length of the region of overlap (13) on the longitudinal axis (L) of 
the case is limited in the known manner by stops (17).
