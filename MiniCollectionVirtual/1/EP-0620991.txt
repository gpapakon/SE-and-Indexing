includes, for each tray (1), clutch means comprising: 


a wheel (7) mounted to rotate about a vertical axis 
and passing through said side window (9), the wheel being 

adapted to be in engagement simultaneously with the drive 
shaft (4) and with the drive surface (10) of the tray; and 
means (11, 13) for selectively either coupling said 
tray (1) to the drive shaft (4) by means of said wheel (7), 

or else decoupling said tray (1) from the drive shaft (4). 
A cabinet according to claim 1, in which, for each tray, 
said drive surface (10) is constituted by inside teeth, and 

said wheel (7) is a gear wheel. 
A cabinet according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which, for 
each tray, said wheel (7) is permanently engaged with the 

drive surface (10) of said tray (1), and said means (11, 
13) for selectively either coupling said tray (1) to the 

drive shaft (4) by the means of said wheel (7) or else 
decoupling said tray (1) from the drive shaft are means for 

selectively coupling said wheel (7) to the drive shaft (4) 
or for decoupling it from the drive shaft (4).  

 
A cabinet according to any preceding claim, in which, 
for each tray, said clutch means further includes 

mechanical coupling means (6) integral with the drive shaft 
(4), said wheel (7) is axially displaceable parallel to the 

drive shaft (4) between a clutched position where it is in 
engagement both with said tray and with said mechanical 

coupling means (6) integral with the drive shaft, and a 
declutched position in which it is not in engagement both 

with said tray and with said mechanical coupling means (6) 
integral with the drive shaft, and said means (11, 13) for 

selectively either coupling said tray to the drive shaft by 
the means of said wheel, or else decoupling said tray from 

the drive shaft comprise: 

means (11, 12) for displacing the wheel (7) towards 
its clutched position independently of the position of the 

wheels (7) corresponding to the other trays (1); and 
means (13, 14, 15, 16) for displacing the wheel (7) 
towards its declutched position. 
A cabinet according to any preceding claim, in which 
said hollow vertical post (2) is made up of cylindrical 

elements (8) that are superposed and secured to one 
another. 
A cabinet according to claim 5, in which said 
cylindrical elements (8) on which the trays (1) are mounted 

to rotate, are all identical. 
A cabinet according to claim 5 or claim 6, in which the 
drive shaft (4) is made up of lengths (4a) that are 

disposed end-to-end and that are constrained to rotate with 
one another, each length (4a) including mechanical coupling 

means adapted to couple the length to one of the wheels 
(7), with each length (4a) being mounted to rotate by being  

 
engaged in two bearings forming parts of two respective 

adjacent ones of the cylindrical elements (8). 
A cabinet according to claim 4, in which the means (13, 
14, 15, 16) for displacing the wheels (7) towards their 

declutched positions comprise:

(15a) and mounted to slide vertically between a rest 

position in which the transverse arms (15a) do not 
interfere with the wheels (7), and an active position in 

which the transverse arms (15a) urge all of the wheels (7)
