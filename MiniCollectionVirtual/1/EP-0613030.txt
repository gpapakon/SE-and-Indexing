<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an optical fiber connector wherein, when housings (11, 
13) are connected to each other, slidable contact of pushing pieces (18) causes 

elastic elements (31) to be deformed to push down locking elements (32) and 
abutment of an opening effector (16) causes guide pins (33) to move upwardly 

to rotate a hood body (28) in an exposing direction, and when the housings (11, 
13) are separated from each other, abutment of a closing effector (17) causes 

the guide pins (33) to move downwardly to rotate the hood body (28) in a 
covering direction, whereby an end surface of an optical fiber (14) is covered 

and exposed by the rotation of the hood body (28). The end surface of the 
optical fiber (14) is completely covered and protected while the elastic elements 

(31) are prevented from being subjected to plastic deformation, and the 
reliability of the end surface protection of the optical fiber (14) is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber connector
for connecting an optical fiber to a photoelectric
element.A conventional optical fiber connector is constructed
as shown in Figs. 25 to 28, for example.Figs. 25 and 27 are perspective views of an optical fiber
housing in different states. Figs. 26 and 28 are right
side sectional views of the optical fiber housing, with
some portions corresponding to those of Figs. 25 and 27 removed
respectively.The optical fiber housing 1 is thin and hollow in construction.
A threading portion 1b of a mounting element 4
for mounting a protective tube 3 of an optical fiber 2 is
formed integrally with a grip portion 1a provided on the
rear end side of the optical fiber housing 1. A front end
of the optical fiber 2 inserted in the tube 3 fitted to the
mounting element 4 is inserted into the optical fiber housing
1. A small box-like hood 5 having an opened rear surface
is slidably mounted along a guide recess 1d to a coupling
portion 1c to be coupled to a module housing (not
shown) provided on the front end side of the optical fiber
housing 1. Although not shown, an engaging mechanism is
provided to the hood 5 and the coupling portion 1c so as to
prevent the hood 5 from disengaging from the coupling portion
1c.Two ferrules 6 receiving the front ends of two optical
fibers 2 are provided within the hood 5 and mounted to the
coupling portion 1c of the optical fiber housing 1. Two apertures
7 are formed in the front side surface of the hood
5 so that the tips of the ferrules 6 project therethrough
out of the hood 5 when the hood 5 slides rearwardly. Before
the rearward sliding of the hood 5, the ferrules 6 are 
housed completely within the hood 5 which protects the end
surfaces of the optical fibers 2. The rearward sliding of
the hood 5 causes the front ends of the ferrules 6 to project
outwardly of the hood 5, permitting the connection between
two photoelectric elements in the module housing and
the end surfaces of the optical fibers 2 when the module
housing not shown is coupled to the optical fiber housing
1.Four elastic pieces 8 are formed integrally with the
optical fiber housing 1, two of the elastic pieces 8 having
upwardly urged front ends on the upper surface of the coupling
portion 1c of the optical fiber housing 1, the other
two having downwardly urged front ends on the lower surface.
The front end of each elastic piece 8 is thicker than
the rear end thereof, so that the front ends of the upper
elastic pieces 8 protrude upwardly of the upper surface of
the
