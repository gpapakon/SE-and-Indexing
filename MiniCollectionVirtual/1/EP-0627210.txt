<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article (10) comprises a substantially liquid-impermeable 
outer cover member (30) having a length (90) and 

a width (92). The outer cover (30) provides a rear waistband 
portion (14) and a front waistband portion (12), and has a 

layer of polymer film material on an outer surface of the 
front waistband portion (12) of the outer cover (30). A 

liquid permeable topsheet layer (28) is provided for 
contacting a wearer's skin, and an absorbent body (32) is 

interposed between the outer cover (30) and the topsheet 
layer (28). The absorbent body (32) has a length (94) and 

width (96) which are smaller than the outer cover length (90) 
and width (92), thereby providing end margins and side 

margins of the outer cover. An adhesive fastening mechanism 
(36) adheres to the film layer to secure the front and rear 

waistband portions (12,14) of the outer cover (30) about the 
wearer. An elastic member (82) is connected to provide 

elasticized gathers along a cross-direction of the rear 
waistband portion (14) of the outer cover (30). An outermost 

layer (84) of substantially nonwettable, resilient material 
is connected to overlie the polymer film of the outer cover 

along the front waistband portion (12) of the outer cover 
(30), thereby sandwiching the polymer film between the 

topsheet layer (28) and the outermost layer (84) of resilient 
material. The outermost resilient material (84) has a 

lengthwise extent (86) which is less than the length (90) of 
the outer cover (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to absorbent articles,
particularly absorbent personal care products.Absorbent articles, such as disposable diapers,
have included elasticized front and rear waistband sections
which have been elasticized with soft elastic members
composed of nonwoven fabric components. The
soft nonwoven elastomeric members may be located on
the outward surface or the bodyside surface of a substantially
liquid impermeable polymer film backsheet
layer, and may extend the total cross-directional widths
of the waistband sections. For example, see U.S.P.
4,861,652 issued August 29, 1989, to M. Lippert et al.Conventional diapers have been configured
with a transverse edge portions which can be folded
along a fold line to provide a smaller diaper for newborn
infants. For example, see U.S.P. 4,475,912 issued October
9, 1984, to F. Coates; U.S.P. 4,537,591 issued
August 27, 1985, to F. Coates; U.S.P. 4,681,581 issued
July 21, 1987, to F. Coates; and U.S.P. 4,728,326 issued
March 1, 1988, to J. Gilles.Other conventional, disposable diapers have
incorporated a V-shape or U-shape notch cut away from
the front waistband edge of the diaper to avoid contact
with the umbilical cord region of a newborn infant.Conventional diapers, such as those described
above, have not, however, provided a desired combination
of comfort and resistance to leakage. Structures
that require complicated folding can be excessively difficult
to configure on a moving infant, and typically
employed materials have permitted excessive wicking
of liquids out from the absorbent Cutouts at the front
waistband edge of the diaper have exhibited the problem
of excessive wetness and/or leakage at the waistband.The edges of the cutouts can also excessively
irritate the wearer's skin. From EP-A-0 433 951 an
absorbent article is known having a liquid-permeable
topsheet, an absorbent body, a liquid-impermeable
backsheet and fastening means. The absorbent article
according to this document furthermore contains a
breathable panel which is located on the backsheet at
its front and/or waist end portions. The breathable panel
is provided for improved vapor transmission and the
document does not address the problem of a reduction
of leakage or a reduction of irritation of the wearer's
skin. As a result, there has been a continued need for
improved structures which provide a desired combination
of comfort and leakage resistance at the front waistband
area of a disposable garment. More particularly,
there has been a continued need for a diaper which
avoids
