<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistive read sensor incorporates a granular multilayer 
sensing element comprising a plurality of layers of generally flat 

particles (31) of a ferromagnetic material embedded in a nonmagnetic 
electrically conductive material. A bias layer (45) separated from the 

magnetoresistive sensing element by a spacer layer (43) 
provides a magnetic 

field to bias the magnetoresistive sensing element at a desired non-signal 
point. The ferromagnetic and the nonmagnetic materials are 

mutually immiscible, or may be miscible or partially miscible and 
processed in a manner to control interdiffusion. The magnetoresistive 

sensing element is formed by alternatively depositing layers of 
ferromagnetic material and layers of nonmagnetic conductive material on a 

substrate and then annealing the structure. During the annealing cycle, 
the layers of nonmagnetic material above and below the ferromagnetic 

layers penetrate at grain boundaries and break the continuity of the 
ferromagnetic layers to form layers or planes of ferromagnetic particles 

embedded in a matrix of nonmagnetic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to magnetic transducers for
reading information signals recorded in a magnetic medium.It is well-known in the prior art to utilize a magnetic read
transducer referred to as a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor or head for
reading high density recorded data from magnetic media. An MR sensor
detects magnetic field signals through the resistance changes of a read
element fabricated of a magnetic material as a function of the strength
and direction of magnetic flux being sensed by the read element. These
prior art MR sensors operate on the basis of the anisotropic
magnetoresistive (AMR) effect in which a component of the read element
resistance varies as the square of the cosine (cos2) of the angle between
the magnetization and the direction of sense current flow through the
read element. A more detailed description of the AMR effect can be found
in "Memory, Storage, and Related Applications", D.A. Thompson et al.,
IEEE Trans. Mag. MAG-11, p. 1039 (1975).U.S. Patent No. 4,896,235 entitle "Magnetic Transducer Head
Utilizing Magnetoresistance Effect", granted to Takino et al on January
23, 1990, discloses a multilayered magnetic sensor which utilizes the AMR
and comprises first and second magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic
layer in which at least one of the magnetic layers is of a
material exhibiting the AMR effect. The easy axis of magnetization in
each of the magnetic layers is set perpendicular to the applied magnetic
signal such that the MR sensor element sensor current provides a magnetic
field in the magnetic layers parallel to the easy axis thus eliminating
or minimizing Barkhausen noise in the sensor. "Thin Film MR Head for
High Density Rigid Disk Drive" by H. Suyama et al, IEEE Trans. Mag., Vol.
24, No. 6, 1988 (pages 2612-2614) discloses an multilayered MR sensor
similar to that disclosed by Takino et al.A second, different and more pronounced magnetoresistive effect has
also been described in which the change in resistance of a layered
magnetic sensor is attributed to the spin-dependent transmission of
conduction electrons between ferromagnetic layers via a nonmagnetic layer
separating the ferromagnetic layers and the accompanying spin-dependent
scattering at the layer interfaces. This magnetoresistive effect is
variously referred to as the "giant magnetoresistive" or "spin valve" 
effect. Such a magnetoresistive sensor fabricated of the appropriate
materials provides improved sensitivity and greater change in resistance
than observed in sensors utilizing
