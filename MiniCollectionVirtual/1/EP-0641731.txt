<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a seal in the gap between the border of a building opening (1) and the rear of a vehicle, having a deformable, elastic apron (2, 3, 5, 8) which can be moved compliantly by the vehicle in the direction of the building (1) and of which the side strips (2) are fastened, laterally on the outside, on vertical metal profiles (7) which are guided by oblique connecting rods (6) and from which side tarpaulins (8) extend to the building (1), the two thickened borders (9, 10) of the side tarpaulins (8) being mounted displaceably in undercut grooves (11, 12) of the metal profiles (7, 13) and/or grooves (11, 12) of further metal profiles (13) fastened on the building (1), but being fixed locally against displacement. In order also to permit seals of this type with obliquely downwardly directed connecting rods (17), then, according to the invention, the building-side borders (13) are altogether secured against displacement, e.g. at the top and bottom (20, 21), and the front borders are secured against displacement only in their top end region (22).

Deformable seal for sealing the gap between the 
edge of a building opening (1) and the rear of a vehicle 

being positioned thereat, having a deformable apron 
which is elastically resiliently displaceable towards 

the building if impinged by the vehicle, the lateral 
strips (2) of said apron being mounted laterally 

externally on vertical metal profiles (7), which are 
guided by inclined guide means (17), lateral covers (8) 

extending from said metal profiles to the building, the 
two thickened edges of the lateral covers (8) being 

displaceably mounted in undercut grooves (11) in the 
metal profiles (7) and/or in grooves (12) in additional 

metal profiles (13) mounted on the building, but said 
edges are prevented from becoming displaced in a 

localised manner by securement, characterised in that 
the guide means (17) are orientated inclinedly 

downwardly from the building, and in that all of the 
edges (10) provided adjacent the building, e.g. at the 

upper and lower ends, and only the front edges (9) in 
the upper end region are prevented from becoming 

displaced. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that 
on each side of the seal, only one guide means (17) is 

provided, which co-operates in the lower end region with 
its metal profile (7), which is suspended elastically 

resiliently from the top portion, more especially a 
cross-piece member (4), which portion serves to suspend 

a transverse member (3) of the apron in a curtain-like 
manner.  

 
Seal according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the top portion is raisable. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the guide means (17) are elastically bendable.
