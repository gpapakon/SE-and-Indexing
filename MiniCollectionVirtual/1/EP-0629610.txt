<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing iodopropargyl carbamate compounds comprising forming N-alkyl(C₁-C₆)propargyl 
carbamate by

 
either A) reacting together an alkyl(C₁-C₆)amine, liquid supercritical carbon dioxide, 

propargyl alcohol, and optionally a catalyst;
 

or B) reacting a dialkyl(C₁-C₃) carbonate with propargyl alcohol in the presence of a 
first catalyst under conditions to produce dipropargyl carbonate, and then reacting said 

dipropargyl carbonate with an alkyl(C₁-C₆)amine, optionally in the presence of a second 
catalyst;

 
then reacting said N-alkyl(C₁-C₆)propargyl carbamate with an iodinating agent, is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns chemical processes for preparation of iodopropargyl 
carbamates. POLYPHASE® fungicide is one of the leading paint mildewcides in the market 
place currently. The active ingredient is N-butyl iodopropargyl carbamate. US 3,923,870 discloses what is presumed to be the commercial process for preparing N-butyl 
iodopropargyl carbamate. EP 0014032A discloses reacting an alkynol with an isocyanate 
and followed by iodination. These two processes use butyl isocyanate which is presumably 
produced from the reaction of butyl amine with phosgene. Isocyanates are generally toxic and 
are hazardous materials to handle. A more recent process patent, GB 222 0000A published 
June 23, 1989, discloses a method which uses as a starting material alkynyl chloroformate 
which is presumably produced from the reaction from propargyl alcohol and phosgene. 
Alkynyl chloroformate is also toxic, unstable, and hazardous. Although phosgene is a cheap 
raw material, it is also a very hazardous material. It is likely that the cost of production of N-butyl 
iodopropargyl carbamate is greatly influenced by the procedures necessary for the safe 
handling of phosgene. EP 539092A also discloses a process for the preparation of N-butyl iodopropargyl 
carbamate that avoids the use of phosgene and isocyanates. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for preparation 
of iodopropargyl carbamates. A further object is to provide a process in which phosgene or 
butyl isocyanate and other hazardous raw materials used in prior art processes need not be 
handled, and reduced amounts of solvent may be used. A further object is to provide a 
process where any unreacted propargyl alcohol can be recycled. The present invention provides a process for preparing iodopropargyl carbamate 
compounds, comprising forming N-alkyl(C₁-C₆)propargyl carbamate by
 
either A) reacting together an alkyl(C₁-C₆)amine, liquid supercritical carbon dioxide, 
propargyl alcohol, and optionally a catalyst;
 
or B) reacting a dialkyl(C₁-C₃) carbonate with propargyl alcohol in the presence of a 
first catalyst under conditions to produce dipropargyl carbonate, and then reacting said 
dipropargyl carbonate with an alkyl(C₁-C₆)amine, optionally in the presence of a second 
catalyst;
 
then reacting said N-alkyl(C₁-C₆)propargyl carbamate with an iodinating agent. While the process can be used to produce N-alkyl(C₁-C₆) iodopropargyl carbamates, the 
preferred product is N-butyl iodopropargyl carbamate.  For process route A, the
