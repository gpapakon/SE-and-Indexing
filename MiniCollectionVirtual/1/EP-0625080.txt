<ABSTRACT>
A precision twist drill including two helical teeth separated by flutes. The diameter is equal to the minimum diameter of the hole to be drilled +0.005 mm, the heel (3) has a width of 0.1-0.2 mm, the teeth have no foreside; the end is ground according to two angles with a central radiate pit (4); the cutting edges (1, 2) of the two pits (4) are symmetrical and all the drill surfaces are polished with an accuracy of under 0.1 micron Ra.

<CLAIMS>
A drill bit comprising a generally cylindrical-shaped body having 
one end in the shape of a cone, presenting helical grooves (5) 

extending over the cylindrical body, said body having an axis of 
rotation passing through the tip of the end cone, the cylindrical 

body presenting two helical edges separated by the grooves, and 
terminated at the front of the drill bit by two sharpened teeth (1, 

2),
 
the drill bit being characterized in that: 


each front tooth (1, 2) presents two slopes and a pit (4), each 
pit (4) radiating into the groove, one-third on the edge side and 

two-thirds on the groove side so as to have a cutting positive-section 
edge; 
the helical edges of the body presenting a cylindrical land (3) 
of width 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm; 
the outside diameter of the tool is 0.005 mm greater than the 
nominal diameter of the hole to be drilled; 
the cutting edges of each tooth (1, 2) and of the pits (4) are 
exactly centered relative to the tip of the cone; and 
all of the surfaces of the tool are polished to within an 
accuracy of less than +0.1 microns Ra.
