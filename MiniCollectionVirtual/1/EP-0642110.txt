<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, there is provided 
a tamper evident security seal suitable for tying the 

neck of a bag or the like. The seal comprises a strap 
(1) having a free end and a housing (2) at its opposite 

end. The housing has a passage therethrough into one end 
of which the free end of the strap can be slidingly 

inserted and passed out through the other end of the 
passage so that the strap forms a loop. Teeth (8) 

project obliquely into the passage between its ends so 
as to engage with the strap inside the passage, the teeth 

being made of material which is hard relative to the 
material of the strap, whereby the teeth permit sliding 

insertion of the strap into the passage but resist 
sliding withdrawal therefrom. The end surfaces of the 

teeth (8) in engagement with the strap (1) form cutting 
edges, so that attempted forced withdrawal of the strap 

from the passage will cause the teeth to cut the strap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a security seal, and more 
particularly to a tamper evident security seal suitable 
for tying the neck of a bag or the like. Some examples of tamper evident security seals for 
tying bags are known. They generally comprise a strap, 
usually of plastics material, with a housing at one end. 
The housing includes a non-return passage into which the 
free end of the strap can be slidingly inserted, but not 
slidingly withdrawn therefrom. The strap can thus form 
a loop, which can be tightened around the neck of a bag. 
Such security seals are used for tying the necks of bags 
containing valuable items, in such a way that any 
unauthorised interference with the neck of the bag during 
transit of the bag is immediately evident. The strap is 
thus tightened around the neck of the bag before transit. 
After transit, the security seal is checked to make sure 
there has been no interference, and it is then cut or 
broken by authorised personnel. In known examples of such security seals, the strap 
is of plastics material and circular in cross section. 
The passage in the housing is correspondingly circular, 
and incorporates between its ends a metal spring grip 
comprising teeth, usually four equally spaced around the 
circle, which project obliquely into the passage. As the 
free end of the strap is inserted into and passed through 
the passage, these teeth are deflected in the direction 
of insertion, so that the strap can be inserted in the 
passage to any desired extent, thus enabling the strap 
to be tightened around the neck of the bag. However, if 
an attempt is made to withdraw the strap from the 
passage, the teeth dig in to the plastics material of the 
strap and resist such withdrawal.  
 In another example, the strap comprises a succession 
of portions of varying diameter, the diameter of each 
portion being least where closest to the free end of the 
strap, and increasing gradually towards the end of the 
portion, where there is a sudden decrease in diameter, 
forming a flat circumferential shoulder, before the 
beginning of the next successive portion. During 
insertion of the strap into the passage, the teeth are 
deflected by the increasing diameter of each portion, but 
on attempted withdrawal, the teeth will abut against the 
flat shoulder portion and thus resist such withdrawal. An illustration of the above type of seal is to be found in GB-A-2 205 279. A disadvantage of the above known seals is that they 
are susceptible to unauthorised interference. By 
gradually

<CLAIMS>
A tamper evident security seal suitable for 
tying the neck of a bag or the like, comprising a strap 

(1) having a free end and a housing (2) at its opposite 
end, the housing having a passage (3) therethrough into 

one end of which the free end of the strap can be 
slidingly inserted and passed out through the other end 

of the passage so that the strap forms a loop, and teeth 
(8) projecting obliquely into the passage between its 

ends so as to engage with the strap inside the passage, 
the teeth being made of material which is hard relative 

to the material of the strap, whereby the teeth permit 
sliding insertion of the strap into the passage but 

resist sliding withdrawal therefrom, characterised in 
that the end surfaces of the teeth (8) in engagement with 

the strap (1) form cutting edges, so that attempted 
forced withdrawal of the strap from the passage will 

cause the teeth to cut the strap. 
A security seal according to Claim 1, in which 
the strap (1) is made of plastics material and the teeth 

(8) are made of metal. 
A security seal according to Claim 1 or 2, in 
which the strap (1) is a flat strap, having a width 

several times greater than its thickness. 
A security seal according to Claim 5, in which 
the teeth (8) form at least one pair of opposed cutting 

edges, each engaging with a flat side of the strap (1). 
A security seal according to Claim 4, in which 
the teeth form two pairs of opposed cutting edges.  

 
A security seal according to any of Claims 3 
to 5, in which the ends of the teeth are chamfered.
