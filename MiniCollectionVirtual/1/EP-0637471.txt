<ABSTRACT>
Device to retrieve and discharge short bars, which is 
associated with a counting and separation zone (16) of bar 

feeder means (12) upstream of a station for the formation of 
bundles of bars, the bars (11) being substantially butted 

at a first side of the device and being fed forwards in a 
direction perpendicular to their lengthwise extent, the bars 

(11) of a required length protruding at the second side of 
the device from their feeder means (12), a means (19) to 

perform temporary retention being included in cooperation 
with the counting and separation zone (16) and with the 

second side of the device and defining an extraction station 
(15), which is equipped with a first plurality of 

separator/extractor rolls (27) within the bar feeder means 
(12) and with a second plurality of extractor rolls (28) 

outside the bar feeder means (12) and at the opposite side 
to the temporary retention means (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device to retrieve and discharge
short bars, as set forth in the main claim.The bars with which the invention is concerned are rolled
or drawn bars sheared to size, which are conveyed on a
conveyor means to a packaging station.The device to retrieve and discharge short bars according
to the invention is employed in cooperation with bar feeder
means such as conveyor chains, for instance, so as to
retrieve and discharge, upstream of the counting and
separation zone, the bars which have a length shorter than
the nominal pre-set length.The state of the art covers the problem of retrieving and
discharging short bars included in a plurality of bars being
fed parallel and side by side on a conveyor chain means in a
direction perpendicular to the lengthwise extent of the
bars.The especially important requirement in this field is to
be able to extract the short bars from the plurality of bars
without affecting or slowing down the output.This means that the extraction has to be carried out on
each occasion without stopping the feed of the layer of bars
and without occupying the extraction station for too much
time, for otherwise that station would not be productive.The short bars have to be removed when they not meet the
requirements of a pre-set length and do not fall within the
limits of an accepted dimensional tolerance.These too short bars are removed so as to ensure the
formation of homogeneous bundles consisting of bars all of
which have a minimum length that complies with the specified
requirements.The state of the art contains a solution whereby the short 
bars are removed during their forward feed on substantially
horizontal conveyor chains by including at a given
determined point in those conveyor chains a separation
channel having its axis parallel to the axis of the bars
being fed and therefore substantially perpendicular to the
direction of feed of the bars.Bridge-type supporting means are fitted at the separation
channel and are spaced apart transversely and extend
lengthwise so as to straddle the separation channel
completely.The transverse gap between the supporting means is such
that the bars having a length greater than the required
minimum rest with their ends on the supporting means, which
are associated with chain means that ensure the onward feed
of the bars.The bars which do not reach the pre-set minimum length
fall when they reach the separation channel since they are
no longer upheld by the conveyor chains or by the supporting
means.This system entails the

<CLAIMS>
Device to retrieve and discharge short bars, comprising
feeding means (12) for feeding the bars along a direction

perpendicular to their longitudinal axis towards a counting
and separation zone (16), said feeding means including a

first longitudinal side and a second longitudinal side, and
means for causing the bars (11) to be butted with respect

to said first longitudinal side and partly protruding with
respect to said second longitudinal side, the device being

characterised in that retention means (19) are provided
upstream of said counting and separation zone (16) and

located at said second longitudinal side for the temporary
retention of the bars protruding from the second

longitudinal side against said feeding means (12), said
retention means (19) defining an extraction station (15)

comprising a first plurality of separator/extractor rolls
(27) in a zone included between said first longitudinal

side and said second longitudinal side and a second
plurality of extractor rolls (28) arranged outside said

feeding means (12) and in correspondence with said first
longitudinal side which is opposite to said retention means

(19). 
Device as in Claim 1, in which the retention means (19)
consists of at least one movable trolley (20) able to

advance at the same speed as, and beside, the bar feeder
means (12).
Device as in Claim 1, in which the retention means (19)
consists of a first rotary endless articulated conveyor

(29).
Device as in Claim 2 or 3, in which the retention means
(19) comprises electromagnet means (22).
Device as in Claim 2 or 3, in which the retention means
(19) comprises in its upper portion a momentarily actuable

clamping element (23).
Device as in Claim 3 or 4, which comprises a second
overlying endless articulated conveyor (32) with pressure

means. 
Device as in any claim hereinbefore, which includes a
counting screw means (17) downstream of the extraction

station (15).
