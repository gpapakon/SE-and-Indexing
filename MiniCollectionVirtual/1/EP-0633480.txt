<ABSTRACT>
In MRI data acquisition according to the GRASE (gradient and spin-echo) 
sequence, trajectories (562, 563) in 
k
-space are arranged such that different coordinates 
(
k
x
, 
k
y
) in that space have monotonic relations with parameters (
t
, τ) that are related to 
physical effects, such as magnetic field inhomogeneities, T₂*-effects and motion, that 

causes artefacts in the image. By doing so, the artefacts are reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for magnetic resonance imaging of a 
body placed in a stationary and substantially homogeneous main magnetic field, the 
method comprising 
applying an excitation radio-frequency pulse (RF-pulse) for excitation of nuclear 
dipole moments in at least a portion of the body, followed by applying a plurality of refocusing RF-pulses separated by intervals, switching, during said intervals, a plurality of gradient magnetic fields including 
reversal of gradient magnetic fields, for generating a plurality of magnetic resonance 
signals in the excited portion, measuring signal samples of said magnetic resonance signals, and transforming said signal samples into an image. The invention also relates to an apparatus for magnetic resonance imaging 
of a body placed in a stationary and substantially homogeneous main magnetic field 
according to such a method, the apparatus comprising means for establishing the main 
magnetic field, means for generating gradient magnetic fields superimposed upon the 
main magnetic field, means for radiating RF-pulses towards the body, control means for 
steering the generation of the gradient magnetic fields and the RF-pulses, and means for 
receiving and sampling magnetic resonance signals generated by sequences of RF-pulses 
and switched gradient magnetic fields, said control means being arranged for 
applying an excitation radio-frequency pulse (RF-pulse) for excitation of nuclear 
dipole moments in at least a portion of the body, followed by applying a plurality of refocusing RF-pulses separated by intervals, switching, during said intervals, a plurality of gradient magnetic fields including 
reversal of gradient magnetic fields, for generating a plurality of magnetic resonance 
signals in the excited portion, measuring signal samples of said magnetic resonance signals, and  transforming said signal samples into an image. Such a method is known from the Article "GRASE (Gradient and Spin-Echo) 
MR imaging: A new fast clinical imaging technique" by D.A. Feinberg and K. 
Oshio, published in Radiology, Vol. 181, pages 597-602 (1991). In this technique a 
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence of RF-pulses is applied in which during 
the occurrence of the spin-echo, a plurality of field or gradient echo signals is generated 
by means of gradient reversals. In between each pair of refocusing RF-pulses a signal is 
sampled with different phase encoding. This allows fast sampling in k-space and 
provides sufficient information for a complete image in
