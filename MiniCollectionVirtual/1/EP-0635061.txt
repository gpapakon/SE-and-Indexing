<ABSTRACT>
The survival of cells is limited by introducing into the cells a regulatably expressible gene whose expression results in the formation of a cytoplasmatically active hydrolytic enzyme. Populations of cells containing, in addition to such a regulatably expressible gene, a DNA coding for an immunologically active, pesticidally active or environmental pollutant-degrading gene product, may be useful in immunologically active compositions, pesticidally active compositions and environmental pollutant-degrading compositions, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a novel system of biological
containment of genetically engineered microorganisms. The
invention relates to a cell or a population hereof
which does not constitute a human or animal body containing
a regulatably expressible gene whose expression results in
the formation of a cytoplasmatically active hydrolytic exo-enzyme
at a rate which leads to cell function limitation; to a
recombinant replicon containing such a regulatably expressible
gene; to methods of limiting the survival of a population
of cells which does not constitute a human or animal body containing the expressible gene, to a method of
containing an extrachromosomal recombinant replicon to a
first kind of cells and of stochastically limiting the survival
of a cell population which does not constitute a human or animal body.There is also provided an immunologically active composition,
a pesticidal composition and an environmental pollutant-degrading
composition, all of which contains a cell population
as defined above wherein the cells further contains a
DNA sequence coding for a gene product which is immunologically
active, pesticidally active or environmental pollutant-degrading,
respectively.The increasing application of recombinant DNA technology to
engineer novel microorganism which are industrially useful
have caused concerns in both the scientific community and the
general public over potential risks. These concerns are
primarily related to the potential harm to humans and to
undesirable and/or uncontrollable ecological consequences
upon deliberate or unintentional release of such genetically
engineered microorganisms (GEMs) into the environment. These
concerns have led to the establishment of official guidelines 
for the safe handling of GEMs in laboratories and production
facilities where such organisms are applied. Up till now,
such guidelines have primarily been directed to measures of
physically containing GEMs in laboratories and production
facilities with the aim of reducing the likelihood that
workers in such facilities were contaminated, or that the
GEMs were to escape from their primary physical environment,
such as a fermentation vessel.It is presently being recognized that the level of safety in
the handling of GEMs can be increased by combining physical
containment measures with biological containment measures to
reduce the possibility of the survival of the genetically
engineered organisms if they were to escape from their primary
environment.Lately, however, concerns have become
