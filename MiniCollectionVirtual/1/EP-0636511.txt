<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a folding seat, with a restoring spring (9) and a stop (7), which transmits the torque of a folded-down seat surface (2) to the wall (1), in which a hinge has a mounting support (5) attached to a wall (1), a bearing support (4) fixed on the seat surface (1) and a shaft (3). It is recommended that the shaft (3) be mounted rotatably relative to the mounting support (5), that the stop (7) be fastened on the shaft (3), that the bearing support (4) be connected to the shaft (3) via a securing pin (6) which shears off in the event of an overload, and that the restoring spring (9) act on the shaft (3) and the mounting support (5). Alternatively, it is proposed that the shaft (3) be mounted rotatably relative to the mounting support (5), that the stop (7) be mounted on the shaft (3), that the bearing support (4) be connected to the shaft (3) by means of an overload coupling (12) and that the restoring spring (9) act on the shaft (3) and the mounting support (5).
