<ABSTRACT>
A centreless grinding machine for surfaces of revolution comprises a machine table (11), a grinding wheel (12), a regulating wheel (14) and a workpiece-supporting device (16) arranged between the circumferential surfaces (23, 24) of the said wheels. A workpiece (17) to be worked is placed upon the workpiece-supporting device and held between the said wheels. The grinding wheel is arranged on an X slide (32) which is mounted on a Y slide. The grinding wheel is displaceable relative to the machine table in a first direction (22) substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the workpiece-supporting device and in a second direction (20) perpendicularly thereto. A measuring device (25) is coupled to the X slide (32) and can be moved with the said slides lying opposite relative to the regulating wheel (14) up to the workpiece. With an extendable measuring head (26) having sensing arms (27, 28), the workpiece diameter can be automatically measured without the workpiece having to be removed from the workpiece-supporting device for this purpose. The measuring device is less expensive compared with an externally arranged measuring apparatus, since mechanisms for removing and supplying workpieces are unnecessary. The hold-up times of the machine are short, since the workpiece can, if necessary, be immediately further worked after a measuring operation without a handling being necessary.
