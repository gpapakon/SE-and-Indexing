<ABSTRACT>
A damping and positioning arrangement for actively damping the oscillations of suspended loads during traversing movements of the suspension point, having guide ropes, running between a crane or suspension-rail conveying system and the load, for damping the oscillating movement of the load. According to the invention, it is proposed that at least two guide ropes (6a-6h) be provided for each pendular oscillation plane, and that the guide-rope drums (5) be arranged on a frame (3, 14) hung on the crane or the suspension-rail conveying system and that they be subjected to a tensile force which always acts against the oscillation of the load. The tensile force is produced via a drive unit, the output force or moment of which is controlled independently of the rotational speed of the guide-rope drums. The length of the guide ropes (6a-6h) can be varied independently of one another and also during the operation of the crane or the suspension-rail conveying system.
