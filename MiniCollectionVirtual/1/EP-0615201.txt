<ABSTRACT>
A document detection system using a detection result 
presentation that can facilitate a user's quick 

comprehension of the relevancy of each detected document. 
In this system, a user's input for commanding a document 

detection is analyzed to extract keywords and viewpoints 
relevant to each keyword contained in the user's input, and 

a detection command is constructed from the keywords and 
the viewpoints extracted from the user's input. Then, the 

detection operation is executed to detect those documents 
among a plurality of stored documents which match with the 

constructed detection command as detected documents for a 
detection result. The detection result can be presented in 

the multi-dimensional display formed by setting the 
viewpoints to axes with the detection command as an origin 

and using distances of the detected documents with respect 
to the o
rigin for each viewpoint as coordinates of the 
detected documents with respect to each axis representing 

each viewpoint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document detection system
and method for detecting desired documents from a large number
of documents stored in a document database. It is to be
noted that the term "retrieval" is often used in the
literature of the field instead of the term "detection"
used in the following description. The present
specification adheres to the use of the term "detection"
throughout.In recent years, due to the significant progress and
spread of computers, the electronic manipulations of
documents are becoming increasingly popular as in the
electronic news and electronic mail systems and the CDROM
publications of data sources such as dictionaries and
encyclopedia that had only been available on papers, and it
is expected that this trend of the electronic manipulations
of documents will continue at an increasing pace in future.In conjunction with such electronic manipulations of
documents, much attentions have been attracted to a
document detection system for detecting desired documents
from a large number of documents efficiently, so as to
enable the effective utilization of the documents stored in
a database system in advance.As a conventionally available document detection
system, there has been a system which uses keywords in
combination with logic operators such as AND, OR, NOT or
proximity operators for specifying numbers of characters, 
sentences, and paragraphs that can exist between keywords,
and detects a document by using a specified combination of
keywords and operators as a detection key.However, in such a conventional document detection
system, the detection result has been informed by
displaying either a number of detected documents or titles
of the detected documents alone, so that in order for the
user to check each of the detected documents to see if it
is the desired document or not, it has been necessary for
the user to read the entire content of each of the detected
documents one by one, and this operation has been
enormously time consuming.Moreover, in the conventional document detection
system, in displaying the titles of the detected documents,
the titles are simply arranged in a prescribed order
according to the user's query such as an order of
descending similarities to the keywords used in the
detection key. For this reason, it has been impossible for
the user to comprehend the relative relationships among the
detected documents and the level of similarity with respect
to the detection command for each of the detected documents
from the displayed detection
