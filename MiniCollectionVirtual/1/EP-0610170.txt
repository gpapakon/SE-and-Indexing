<ABSTRACT>
Gas lasers having hollow cylindrical plasma (3) generated using coaxial electrodes (1, 4) are susceptible, especially when the energy supplied is relatively high, to instabilities which lead to pinching of the hollow cylindrical plasma (3) and/or of the hollow cylindrical laser beam (9), which is in conflict with optimum beam power. These instabilities can be avoided by subdividing the discharge space into chambers (6) and the concomitant subdivision of the plasma (3) and of the hollow cylindrical laser beam (9) in the azimuthal direction by dividing walls which run in the radial direction and are insulating and heat-resistant. In this case, a hollow cylindrical laser beam which is also coherent in the azimuthal direction is achieved by having the dividing walls (5) extend at most over the full length of the electrodes (1, 4) and having free spaces being left in front of the mirrors (7, 8), in which the partial beams produced by the action of the dividing walls (6) can again come to interact, which leads to azimuthal (circumferential) coupling and ultimately to coherence of the total beam.

A gas laser with a light-amplifying medium (3) which flows through a cavity 
which is disposed between mutually coaxial electrode arrangements and is arranged 

between resonator mirrors, with separating walls (5) being distributed over the 
circumference of the cavity between said electrode arrangements, which walls extend 

in the radial direction to the axis of the electrode arrangements and subdivide the 
light-amplifying medium and the hollow-cylindrical laser beam into several segments 

(9a to 9h) over the circumference of the arrangement, and the separating walls (5) 

only extend between the two ends of the electrode arrangements, as seen in the 
direction of the axis of the arrangement, and end before the resonator mirrors (7, 8), 

so that between the separating walls (5) and the resonator mirrors (7, 8) there is a 
cavity which is not subdivided by the separating walls (5), as a result of which the 

laser beams created in the individual chambers (6) between adjacent separating walls 
have the possibility of a synchronization and coupling at least in the zones adjacent to 

the two mirrors, so that a wave field which is coherent over the circumference of the 
arrangement can be created, with a cooling for the light-amplifying medium by a gas 

flow supplied to the electrode compartment being provided, characterized in that the 
separating walls (5) extend over only a part of the full electrode length and consist of 

several separating wall sections which are arranged coplanar with respect to one 
another.
