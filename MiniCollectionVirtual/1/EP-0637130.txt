<ABSTRACT>
A receiver comprises an AGC circuit including a 
low noise amplifier for amplifying a reception input 

signal and an AGC amplifier, a level detection circuit 
for producing a strength indication signal indicative of 

an input field strength, and a demodulator. The receiver 
has a function of controlling a gain to keep an amplitude 

of a demodulator input signal at a constant level. A 
bias control circuit controls on and off of a bias 

voltage source to allow and inhibit supply of a bias 
voltage to the low noise amplifier when the strength 

indication signal has a signal level lower than and not 
lower than a first threshold level, respectively. When 

the signal level is thereafter decreased to a second 
threshold level lower than the first threshold level, the 

bias control circuit turns on the bias voltage source to 
supply the bias voltage. A level output circuit serves 

to keep the strength indication signal at a predetermined 
high level when the bias voltage source is turned off.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a receiver, especially such a receiver
for use in a digital communication system and, in particular, to a receiver
with an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit for controlling a gain so as to
keep an average amplitude of a demodulator input signal at a constant
level. The invention also relates to a method of receiving.Among a wide variety of digital communication
systems, a US digital cellular system, for example, is
known as a digital communication system using a modulated
signal modulated in a QPSK (π/4 quadrature phase shift
keying) modulation system. In a receiver for use in the
digital communication system of the type described, a
demodulator input signal supplied to a demodulator must
have an average amplitude kept at a constant level and be
free from distortion. Otherwise, a reception input
signal can not be correctly demodulated. It is therefore
required to keep the average amplitude of the demodulator
input signal at a constant level even if a reception
input level or an input field strength is fluctuated due
to fading or the like. To this end, the receiver of the
type described comprises an AGC circuit including a low
noise amplifier connected to a reception antenna and an 
AGC amplifier located at an input side of the
demodulator.In such a conventional receiver with an AGC
circuit, however, the AGC amplifier is saturated when the
input field strength is increased. This is because the
low noise amplifier has a high gain. In this event,
distortion is caused in the demodulator input signal. As
a consequence, the demodulator can not normally operate
so that a demodulated signal inevitably contains an
error.Taking economic efficiency into account, the
AGC amplifier is allowed to have a dynamic range as wide
as about 70dB at most. Thus, the AGC amplifier is
normally operable at the input field strength between
-115dBm and -45dBm. When the input field strength is
higher than -45dBm beyond the above-mentioned range of
the AGC amplifier, the average amplitude fluctuates.
In order to avoid fluctuation of the average amplitude,
the AGC amplifier must have a high saturation level and a
wide dynamic range. This inevitably increases the scale
of the AGC circuit and the amount of electric current
supplied thereto. It is therefore difficult to
efficiently realize a high saturation level and a wide
dynamic range.The present invention therefore preferably seeks to
provide a receiver with an AGC circuit capable of
expanding a dynamic range of an AGC amplifier in response 
to variation
