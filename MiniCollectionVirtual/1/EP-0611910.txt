<ABSTRACT>
A pipe coupling for repair, comprising the separate housings 
1 and seal rings 2 to be accommodated in the receiving portions 

formed in said housings, wherein a holding portion is formed 
on the internal diameter side of the separate end face 12 in 

the individual housing to receive the projecting seals 22 
formed at the separate ends of the above seal rings and wherein 

the seal rings form multiple string-shaped ring seals as a 
single unit between both ends of the above projecting seals by 

surrounding the portion to be repaired, and having a blocking 
plug in the above housing for a hole to test the sealing 

conditions after fixing to a pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pipe coupling and particularly, 
though not exclusively to a pipe coupling that permits the 
simple, precise repair of leaky joints or piping of a laid 
pipeline without interrupting water passage or gas supply. It is known, for example from US-A-3954288, to provide a pipe 
coupling comprising two complementary portions which are bolted 
around a join in a pipe and which seal with the pipe. 
US-A-3954288 also discloses forming an interspace between first 
and second gaskets and pressurising the interspace to check the 
integrity of the seal. Water services pipes and gas pipes may, due to the passage of 
time, leak as a result of: cracks and wear due to aging; 
corrosion and damage to packing, pipes and joint materials; or 
degradation of welding. The conventional method adopted for repairing such leakage is 
to replace faulty portions. In some cases, filing material is packed into the portions 
where leakage occurred. Such a method of replacing faulty portions can indeed attain 
a repair. However, when water or gas passes through a 
pipeline, this flow must be interrupted, resulting in 
disruption and inconvenience to consumers living in all  
 
downstream areas. Furthermore, to replace a faulty pipe member, operations must 
necessarily be performed on the adjacent members connected 
thereto. Therefore, such replacement requires a considerable 
number of man hours, and is especially labour-intensive in the 
case of underground pipes. The method of packing filling material into leaking portions 
is primitive. When it is difficult to stop effectively leakage 
due to aging or corrosion, this method will result in further 
deterioration of the leaking portions. In particular, this 
method can be rarely adopted these days for a pipeline used at 
very high pressures. Such repair is naturally temporary and unsightly and further 
repair must be executed within a short time. According to the present invention, there is provided a pipe 
coupling for use in repairing a leak in a pipe, the coupling comprising 
first and second complementary housings, each housing having an associated 
unitary seal comprising two interconnected semi-annular 
portions which, in use, cooperate with each other to form a 
seal between pipe sections on opposing sides of the joint and 
with the housings, characterised in that the housings cooperate 
to define a chamber of sufficient size to accommodate a pre-existing 
pipe joint.  
 Preferably a holding portion is formed on the internal diameter 
side of a

A pipe coupling for use in repairing a leak in a pipe, the coupling 
comprising first and second complementary housings (1), each housing (1) 

having an associated unitary seal comprising two interconnected 
semi-annular portions (21) which, in use, cooperate with each 

other to form a seal between pipe sections on opposing sides 
of the joint and with the housings (1), characterised in that 

the housings cooperate to define a chamber of sufficient size 
to accommodate a pre-existing pipe joint. 
A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 1, characterised by a 
holding portion formed on an internal diameter side of a 

divided end face (25) of the individual housings (1), in which 
the holding portion is arranged to receive projecting seals 

(22) interconnecting the semi-annular portions, the semi-annular 
portions of the opposing housings cooperate, in use, 

to form ring seals, and a blocking plug is provided in said 
housing for removably blocking a hole to test the sealing 

conditions after fixing to the pipe. 
A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that 
the lateral faces (22a) of the projecting seals parts and semi-annular 

portions (21c) are planar. 
A pipe coupling according to claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein a 
groove (23) is formed in the centre of the side face of the 

inner side of the semi-annular portions (21) forming the ring  
 

seal, and lips (24) are provided on both sides of the groove 
(23) so that said lips (24) contact a side face (51) of the 

clamping seats of the existing pipe joint (5).
