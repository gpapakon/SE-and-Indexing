<ABSTRACT>
The electrical cable includes at least one layer of metallic wires (4) around a tube shaped core cable (2). The core cable contains optical fibres (3), has the same outer dia. as the individual wires of the immediately adjacent layer, and is formed as a metal tube. The optical fibres are loosely arranged in the metal tube with an over-length which is greater than 5o/00. The tube may be formed from a metal tape, formed into a tube shaped and welded at the edges.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical stranded conductor (1) for high-voltage-free cabling for simultaneous
power and data transmission with at least one layer of metal wires (4)

which are twisted around a central metallic tube (2) containing an optical fibre
(3), 
characterised in that
 the central metal tube (2) has the same external
diameter at least as the individual wires (4) of the immediately adjacent layer

and that the optical fibres (3) are loosely arranged within this metal tube (2)
with an excess length 
>
 5 â€° based on the length of the tube in the manufactured
state, without winding or twisting on carriers.
Stranded conductor in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
metal tube (2) is a steel tube.
Stranded conductor in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that

the wires (4) in the layer immediately bordering on the metal tube (2) support
one-another in an arched manner.
Stranded conductor in accordance with Claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims 
characterised in that
 the layer of wire (4) immediately surrounding the
metal tube consists of aluminium-wrapped steel wires (6).
Stranded conductor in accordance with Claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims 
characterised in that
 at least the wires (4) of the wire layer immediately
surrounding the metal tube (2) are provided with a heat-resistant lubricant.
Stranded conductor in accordance with Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the
heat-resistant lubricant also contains a corrosion-inhibiting ion-exchanger.
