<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing targeting errors encountered 
when trying to locate contaminant particles in a high-magnification 

imaging device (16), based on estimates of 
the particle positions obtained from a scanning device (10). 

The method of the invention includes 
scanning a semiconductor wafer in a scanning device, then preferably moving the wafer 

to a different orientation, and scanning the wafer again, to obtain at least two sets of 
particle coordinates that may differ slightly because of uncertainties in the scanning 

process. The multiple sets of coordinates are averaged to reduce the targeting errors, but 
only after transforming the coordinates to a common coordinate system. The transformation 

step includes computing transformation parameters for each possible pair of particles 
detected in at least two scans, averaging the results, and then transforming all of the 

particle coordinates to the common coordinate system. Optionally, the method may 
include discarding any transformation parameters that deviate too far from the average, 

and then computing the average transformation parameters again.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to techniques for the identification and 
analysis of contaminant particles on semiconductor wafers and, more particularly, to 
techniques for locating particles more reliably when using a high-magnification imaging 
device, such as a scanning electron microscope. Semiconductor fabrication technology 
today deals with wafer sizes up to 200 mm (millimeters) and feature geometries with 
dimensions well below 1µm (micrometer). The presence of a particle larger than about 
a tenth the width of a conductive line on a wafer can lead to failure of a semiconductor 
chip made from the wafer. Therefore, a critical task facing semiconductor process 
engineers is to identify and, as far as possible, to eliminate sources of surface 
contamination. A well known approach to identification and analysis of contaminant 
particles involves the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to locate particles 
on an unpatterned semiconductor wafer, referred to as a mirror wafer. Scanning X-ray 
spectroscopy or optical microscopy systems may also be used for this purpose. Because 
critical particles sizes may be as small as 0.1 - 0.2 µm, the SEM must use a magnification 
of approximately 2000x to allow the smallest critical particles to be seen by the 
human eye, which has a resolution limitation of approximately 0.2 mm. At this high 
level of magnification. it is extremely difficult to find a particle on the wafer unless its 
position is known quite accurately before the SEM or similar system is used. Because the SEM must be operated only at high levels of magnification,  
 
it is not a useful instrument to obtain an overview of particles on an entire wafer. Other 
devices have been developed for this purpose and a two-stage process for locating and 
analyzing particles is normally employed. In the first stage, the wafer is raster-scanned 
with a laser beam to locate practically all of the particles on the wafer or in an area of 
interest on the wafer. The manner in which the laser beam is scattered from the particles 
yields signals from which the approximate sizes and locations of the particles can be 
deduced, for output to a computer display screen. However, because the scattering 
mechanism is not completely understood, the signals are of little help in identifying the 
type, chemical composition, and possible source of contaminant particles. This 
information can only be obtained with the help of a high-magnification imaging device, 
such as an SEM. As already mentioned, locating a
