<ABSTRACT>
A method of coating a piezoelectric substrate with a semi-conducting material by chemical vapour deposition so as to form a coated object which can be easily bonded to another material such as glass. Chemical vapour deposition of a semi-conducting material is performed such that a layer of desired smoothness is deposited on the piezoelectric substrate. Such a method is particularly applicable for piezoceramic ink-jet printers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of coating a 
piezoelectric substrate, preferable a piezoceramic wafer, 
with a substantially uniform layer of a semi-conducting 
material. The invention further relates to a method of 
producing a droplet ejector arrangement according to the 
preamble of claim 11. The invention relates yet further to 
the use of the above-mentioned method. In his work in the field of piezoelectric pumps, the 
present applicant has recognised a need for a means of 
coating piezoelectric substrates with a semi-conducting 
material which is susceptible to doping or other techniques 
to impart electrically-conducting properties to the 
coating. Such substrates are particularly suitable for use 
in ink-jet printing devices of the type described in 
Applicant's International patent application No. 
PCT/EP90/02119, filed 6 December, 1990, in which a 
piezoceramic wafer having planar opposite first and second 
surfaces has grooves or channels extending inwardly 
therein. The groove or grooves of the first face lie offset 
to the groove or grooves of the second face with the 
grooves partially overlapping in the direction of their 
depth. Each groove of one of the faces is intended to 
function as a droplet ejector channel. This is achieved by 
providing defined areas of the piezoceramic wafer with a 
conducting coating, thereby forming electrodes for each 
ejector channel. Thereafter the material is polarized by  
 
applying an electrical voltage between the electrodes. An 
electrical pulse is subsequently applied across the 
electrodes, causing a rapid decrease in volume of the 
ejector channel and thereby effecting discharge of the 
liquid from within the channel. Discharge of the liquid in 
a longitudinal direction is assured by covering the open 
longitudinal extension of the ejector channels with a cover 
plate. This cover plate also serves to impart stability to 
the piezoceramic wafer. Whilst the above-described type of ink-jet printing device 
offers, in theory, a much more versatile printing system, 
its usefulness has until now been hampered by the 
difficulty in obtaining a satisfactory bond between the 
cover plate and the coated piezoceramic wafer. Satisfactory 
bonding is very much dependent on the smoothness of the 
surfaces which are to be bonded. It is relatively easy to 
obtain an adequately smooth surface on the cover plate 
since in most cases the cover plate is made from glass. 
Difficulties arise, however, with the coated piezoceramic 
wafer. A satisfactory degree
