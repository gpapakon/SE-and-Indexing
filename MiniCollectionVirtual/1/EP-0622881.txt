<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spark plug insulator 
of an internal combustion engine and a method of making 
the same for use in an automobile or aircraft, and 
particularly concerns to a spark plug insulator which is 
improved to be superior in insulation and thermal-shock 
resistance. In an internal combustion engine, a spark plug 
insulator is exposed to the ambient temperature as high 
as 2000 °C at an explosion stroke, and then exposed to an 
air-fuel mixture which has a temperature equivalent to 
the atmosphere at an intake stroke. This causes to 
alternately subject the insulator to a heat-and-cool 
cycle repeatedly so as to give the insulator repetitive 
thermal stress. This type of the insulator has been made 
from a sintered ceramic material with aluminum oxide 
(alumina) as a main component. With the recent demand of a high output with a  
 
high fuel efficiency of the internal combustion engine, 
it has been increasingly difficult to cope with an 
enhanced temperature of the combustion gas which causes a 
thermal shock on the insulator made of the aluminum oxide 
based ceramic material. It is found that the thermal 
shock finally induces cracks on the insulator made of the 
aluminum oxide based ceramic material depending on bench 
test conditions. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to 
provide a spark plug insulator which is capable of 
improving a thermal-shock resistance due to repetitive 
thermal stress so as to prevent cracks on the insulator. JP-A-4-098783 discloses a spark plug insulator 
inducting between 0.5 and 10% by weight of Boron Nitride and a metal oxide. According to the invention, there is provided a spark 
plug insulator comprising a sintered body including boron 
nitride and a metal oxide, characterised in that the boron 
nitride comprises 80% by weight or greater of 
the sintered body and the sintered body has a thermal 
expansion coefficient of less than 5.0 x 10-6/°C. Preferably, according to the invention, the metal 
oxide is selected alone or combination from the group 
consisting of magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, silicon oxide, 
boron oxide, yttrium oxide and aluminum oxide.  
 According further to the invention, there is provided 
a method of making a spark plug insulator comprising the 
steps of: mixing a powder of boron nitride (BN), a metal 
oxide additive and ethanol to form a mixture within a nylon 
pot mill by means of nylon ball, the boron nitride being 
equal to or greater than 80% by weight of the 
mixture; drying the mixture for about 10 hours in a
