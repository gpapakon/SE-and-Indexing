<ABSTRACT>
A method for synthesizing sulfurized oligonucleotide analogs, such as phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate analogs, is provided that employs a thiuram disulfide as a sulfurizing agent. The method of the invention may be used to sulfurize any phosphorous(III)-containing intermediate. Preferably, the method is practiced on a commercial DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite and/or phosphorthioamidite intermediates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the synthesis
of oligonucleotides, and more particularly, to a method
for sulfurizing oligonucleotides with thiuram
disulfides to form phosphorothioate and/or
phosphorodithioate analogs thereof.With the development of efficient methods of
synthesis, interest has arisen in the use of anti-sense
oligonucleotides to treat a variety of diseases,
particularly viral infections, e.g. Matsukura et al,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 86, pgs. 4244-4448 (1989).
An antisense oligonucleotide is a synthetic
oligonucleotide of varying length, usually in the range
of about 12 to 30 nucleotides, or nucleotide analogs,
whose sequence is complementary to a predetermined
segment of the RNA, either freshly transcribed or the
messenger (mRNA), critical to some viral function. It
is believed that when an antisense oligonucleotide
hybridizes to its target RNA, it either blocks
translation or processing of the RNA or makes it
susceptible to enzymatic degradation.One problem with this approach has been the
difficulty of getting the antisense oligonucleotide to
its target RNA in sufficient concentration and for
sufficient duration to be effective in shutting down 
the synthesis of undesired proteins, e.g. viral
enzymes, coat proteins, and the like. The
susceptibility of the phosphodiester linkage of the
oligonucleotides to nuclease digestion is believed to
be an important cause of this difficulty, and has
prompted the development of a variety of nucleoside
oligomers linked by nuclease-resistant analogs of the
natural phosphodiester bond, e.g. Miller et al, U.S.
patent 4,511,713 and Ts'o U.S. patent 4,469,863
(methyl- and arylphosphonates); Miro et al, Nucleic
Acids Research, Vol. 17, pgs. 8207-8219 (1989)
(phosphoroselenoates); Brill et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
Vol. 111, pg. 2321 (1989) (phosphorodithioates); and
Matsukura et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 84, pgs.
7706-7710 (1987), and Gene, Vol. 72, pgs. 343-347
(1988) (phosphorothioates).The phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate
analogs are especially promising because they are
highly nuclease-resistant, have the same charge as
natural oligonucleotides, and are taken up by cells in
effective amounts.Phosphorothioates are conveniently synthesized by
automated DNA synthesizers using hydrogen phosphonate
chemistry, which permits the phosphonate backbone to be
sulfurized in a single step off of the automated
synthesizer after synthesis. This is advantageous
because the phosphonate moieties are sulfurized by
exposure to elemental sulfur dissolved
