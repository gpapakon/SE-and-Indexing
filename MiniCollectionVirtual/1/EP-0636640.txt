<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
catalytic N-oxidation of polyamines.One of the most persistent and troublesome problems
arising during modern fabric laundering operations is the
tendency of some colored fabrics to release dye into the
laundering solutions. The dye is then transferred onto
other fabrics being washed therewith.Certain polyamine N-oxide polymers have been found to be
very efficient in eliminating transfer of solubilized or
suspended dyes during laundering operations. Such polyamine
N-oxide polymers are described in copending European Patent
Application No. 93201198.4.This copending European Patent Application also describes
a process for making such polymers by the N-oxidation of 
polyamines using an excess of hydrogen peroxide in the
presence of glacial acetic acid. Whilst such a process
represents an efficient synthetic route to the polyamine N-oxide
polymers its implementation on an industrial scale
presents a number of problems. These problems are largely
associated with the presence of the glacial acetic acid.The combination of glacial acetic acid and hydrogen
peroxide may lead to formation of peracetic acid in the
reaction vessel. Industrially, this presents a safety
problem in that when the peracetic level exceeds certain
critical levels there is a risk of explosion. This risk is
accentuated if the reaction is carried out at a temperature
above room temperature.Since glacial acetic acid is by nature highly corrosive
special reaction vessel materials must be employed for a
process in which it is a necessary component. The
environmental hazards associated with glacial acetic acid
also necessitate that it be recycled at the end of any
process in which it is employed. Both of these constraints
lead to additional complexity and expense in the carrying
out of a process utilising large amounts of glacial acetic
acid.There is an additional problem inherent in the polyamine
N-oxidation process described above. Residual glacial
acetic acid will tend to remain as an impurity in the
polyamine N-oxide product giving the product a vinegary
malodour. This malodour is particularly undesirable where
the polyamine N-oxides are to be incorporated as components
of household laundry detergent products.The Applicants have now discovered an alternative,
efficient N-oxidation process for the formation of
polyamine N-oxide which does not require the use of glacial
acetic acid. This alternative process involves the use of a 
tungstate, vanadate or molybdate catalyst. The reaction is
carried
