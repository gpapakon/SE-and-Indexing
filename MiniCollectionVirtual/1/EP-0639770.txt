<ABSTRACT>
Calibration arrangement (250/420/520) and method 
for calibrating an inspection instrument. The calibration 

arrangement comprises a frame (270/430/530), the frame 
having a slot (290/480/550) therethrough for receiving a 

sonic coupling medium therein. A plurality of channels 
(300/490/560) extend through the frame and are in communication 

with the slot. A plurality of solid reflector rods 
(320) matingly extend through respective ones of the channels 

and into the slot for reflecting sonic energy produced 
by a pulsed ultrasonic transducer (260) mounted on the 

frame and spanning the slot. A pulser (370) stimulates the 
transducer so that the transducer transmits pulsed sonic 

energy through the coupling medium (30) which resides in 
the slot. The sonic energy is reflected by the rods that 

pass through the slot. The reflected sonic energy or 
echoes are received by the transducer, which generates 

transducer output signals that are received by a receiver 
(380). The receiver provides analog output signals that 

are converted by an analog-to-digital converter (390) into 
digital output signals. A computer (400) connected to the 

analog-to-digital converter evaluates the digital output 
signals. A display (410) is connected to the computer for 

viewing the digital output signals. The digital output 
signals viewed on the display are therefore indicative of 

the orientations of the reflector rods in the frame for  
 

calibrating the transducer with respect to the orientations 
of the reflector rods in the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to calibration apparatus
and methods and more particularly relates to a calibration
arrangement and method for calibrating an inspection
instrument, such as an ultrasonic inspection instrument
of the kind typically used to inspect nuclear reactor
pressure vessels.There is a remote possibility that during its service
life, the material comprising the pressure vessel may
indicate anomalies. Such anomalies, if they were to occur,
may be due, for example, to neutron radiation embrittlement
and/or the corrosive effects of the borated moderator
coolant. Therefore, it is desirable that reactor pressure
vessels be inspected for anomalies during the service life
of the pressure vessels.It is current practice to perform this inspection
using ultrasonics. During the inspection, an ultrasonic
inspection device is moved by remote means over a portion
of the interior of the pressure vessel, such as over the
pressure vessel interior wall, nozzles and weldments, to
detect the size and severity of any anomalies therein. See,
in this regard, US-A-4169758, FR-A-7817220 and EP-A-0159484.
See, in addition, US-A-3933026. However, the
operating response or output signals of the ultrasonic
inspection device may vary on a daily basis or even hourly
due to "drift", instrument component aging, or the like.
Such variation in the operating response of the ultrasonic
inspection device may lead to inaccurate inspection results
unless the inspection device is periodically re-calibrated
by appropriate means.To perform the initial calibration, a so-called
"calibration block" is used to calibrate the ultrasonic
inspection device. See, in this regard, US-A-4169758. See
also US-A-4903523. The calibration block of current practice 
comprises a 127.0 to 228.6mm (five to nine inch) thick
and relatively heavy steel block having at least one void
hole therein to simulate an anomaly of the type that may be
encountered in the pressure vessel (e.g., the pressure
vessel wall, nozzles and weldments) . In this regard, an
ultrasonic transducer is brought into contact with and
moved on the surface of the calibration block to direct
ultrasonic energy in the direction of the hole, which is
located at a predetermined distance or depth within the
block. The steel material of the block serves as the sound
transmission or sonic coupling medium that sonically couples
the hole to the ultrasonic transducer, so that a
response is obtained from the hole. More specifically, the
ultrasonic transmission, which may be either a shear
