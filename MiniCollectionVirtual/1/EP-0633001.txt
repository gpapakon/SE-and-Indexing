<ABSTRACT>
A laser targeting device for use during surgical procedures provides 
means for the precise 

co-axial alignment of a narrow laser beam (23) with an x-ray beam (7). 
The device has a case (13) 

which contains a reflecting mirror (92) mounted at 45Â° on a low mass 
assembly. The mirror 

lies directly in front of a radio-opaque cruciform target (88). The case 
is adjustably mounted so 

that the image of the crosshair target may be accurately centred on the target head. A 
calibration aid (117) is used to pinpoint the emanation point of the 

x-ray beam from the source 
cone of the image intensifier (5). 
The angle at which the laser beam strikes the mirror may be varied in two planes. When 
the crosshair image is centred and the laser beam is directed onto the emanation point the 

two beams are rendered precisely co-axial. Accurate drilling along the laser beam path 
without further recourse to x-ray screening is more accurate and eliminates direct 

exposure of the surgeon to irradiation during orthopaedic procedures. A series of special 
drapes (129,147) is provided for the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for achieving precise co-axial alignment of a narrow laser 
light beam to a beam of x-rays generated within an image intensifier system. This is 
achieved without significant degradation of a useful image captured by the system. X-ray 
image intensifier systems are used by surgeons to locate the positions of radio-opaque 
artefacts in relation to nearby anatomical or implanted structures in order that they may 
check, place, augment, fix or remove them. Conventional image intensifiers in clinical use typically comprise the major elements of an 
x-ray source and a target both supported on a rigid and relatively massive structure that 
maintains them substantially at 180 degrees to one another. The x-ray source and target 
are spaced apart by sufficient distance to allow part or all of the patient to be interposed 
between them. The support is generally referred to as a 'C' arm. The system also includes 
a monitor screen that displays the image of the body part lying in the x-ray beam. X-rays and the machines that generate them are hazardous, not only to patients but also to 
those working with or near them and it is well established that cumulative doses can cause 
cancer, cataracts and gonadal damage. Operating theatre and radiographic department 
staff at risk wear lead aprons to protect them from exposure but in some procedures, 
especially in the field of orthopaedics, the surgeon in particular may have to take a 
calculated risk and knowingly expose himself to x-radiation. This practice has increased in recent years with the introduction of reliable intramedullary 
devices for the fixation of fractures of long bones. Although these devices have led to 
substantial improvements in fracture management, the techniques for their satisfactory 
implantation are somewhat demanding. For example, one device that is increasingly widely used in femoral and tibial fractures is 
the Grosse-Kempf intramedullary nail. This is a metal tubular structure, with a single slit 
down its long axis. The diameter of the nail is such that it may be accommodated within 
the intramedullary canal of the bone. Under general anaesthesia the nail is introduced into 
the surgically exposed upper end of the proximal bone fragment. The nail is then driven 
carefully down its length. The fracture is reduced by manipulation of the distal fragment 
using an image intensifier to ensure that the fragments are correctly aligned. The nail is 
then driven down into the distal fracture fragment. In order to
