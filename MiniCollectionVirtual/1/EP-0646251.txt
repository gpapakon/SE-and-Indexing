<ABSTRACT>
A radiation coupling device (10) incorporates a rectangular multimode beamsplitter waveguide (20) connected at one end to a set of input waveguides (18). The input waveguides (18) have inserted within them respective fibre optic waveguides (22). The input waveguides (18) are connected at periodic positions across the beamsplitter waveguide's transverse cross section. The beamsplitter waveguide (20) is also connected at its other end to retroreflecting mirror (24). Radiation propagating in fundamental mode in any one of the input waveguides (18) passes along the beamsplitter waveguide (20) and is retroreflected at the mirror (24). On return, it becomes divided between the input waveguides (18) by virtue of modal dispersion (multimode interference) in the beamsplitter waveguide (20). The device (10) therefore acts as a star coupler.

<DESCRIPTION>
WAVEGUIDE STAR COUPLER USING MULTIMODE INTERFERENCEThis invention relates to a radiation coupling device for coupling a single input to a plurality of outputs.The present invention provides a radiation coupling device incorporating a lrtulti ode waveguide, and wherein:(1 ) a plurality of subsidiary waveguides arranged for fundamental mode operation are connected to the multimode waveguide, (2) reflecting means are arranged to return to the subsidiary waveguides radiation received by the multimode waveguide therefrom, and(3) the relative dimensions and positioning of the subsidiary and multimode waveguides and the reflecting means are arranged to provide for input radiation propagating as a fundamental mode of any one of the subsidiary waveguides to undergo modal dispersion within the multimode waveguide and thereafter to excite the fundamental mode of each of the subsidiary waveguides after return from the reflecting means.The invention provides the advantage that it lends itself to construction in compact form with relatively efficient radiation intensity coupling. It may be implemented in differing waveguide media, such as hollow waveguides suitable for coupling to fibre optics and solid waveguides suitable for optical micro-circuitry.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the subsidiary waveguides are of square cross-section, the multimode waveguide is of rectangular cross- section, the reflecting means is retroreflecting, the subsidiary waveguides are ported centrally to respective like subdivisions of the multimode waveguide's transverse cross-section, and the path length of radiation within the multimode waveguide is 8b^/位K, where K is the number of subsidiary waveguides, b is half the transverse width of the multimode waveguide and 位 is the radiation wavelength within the multimode waveguide. 

The subsidiary waveguides may be arranged for connection to respective fibre optic waveguides. The subsidiary and multimode waveguides may be hollow cored with alumina ceramic waveguide walls. The subsidiary and multimode waveguides may alternatively be ridge waveguides of semiconductor material.In order that the invention might be more fully understood, embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-Figure 1 is a schematic sectional plan view of a coupling device of the invention;Figures 2 and 3 are sectional side views on lines II-II and III-III respectively in Figure 1 ;Figure 4 illustrates transverse electric field
