<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tactile reading
device using a bimorph piezo-electric actuating element
as an actuating source.As disclosed in, e.g., Jpn. UM Appln. KOKAI
Publication No. 62-164380, in a conventional braille
type cell, a plurality of bimorph piezo-electric
actuating elements corresponding to a number of sensing
rods constituting a braille type unit of display are
provided in the horizontal direction in a required
number of steps, with the sensing rods being mounted on
the free end portions of the piezo-electric actuating
elements. When a required piezo-electric actuating element
is selectively driven, the corresponding sensing
rod is vertically moved by the vertical displacement of
the free end portion of this piezo-electric actuating
element, so that the distal end portion of the sensing
rod projects from a finger touch scanning portion,
thereby displaying braille type information.In this conventional tactile reading device, since
the piezo-electric actuating elements are arranged in
the horizontal direction, a large horizontal space is
required. In addition, since the sensing rods move in
the vertical direction, the space must also be large in
the vertical direction, making it difficult to downsize
a braille type cell module constituted by necessary
constituent elements including the piezo-electric 
actuating elements and the sensing rods. In order to
display character information occupying a large number
of lines or graphic information, sensing rods must be
provided at a high density on a necessary sensing surface.
However, in the conventional tactile reading
device in which the piezo-electric actuating elements
are arranged in the horizontal direction, it is difficult
to display such information due to structural
problems.In order to solve these problems, there is provided
a braille type cell in which piezo-electric actuating
elements are arranged in the vertical direction, sensing
rods which are driven in the vertical direction are provided
above the piezo-electric actuating elements, the
sensing rods being driven through a means for converting
the horizontal movement of the free end portions of the
piezo-electric actuating elements to a vertical movement.
As a result, character information occupying a
large number of lines and graphic information, to a certain
degree, can be displayed.See, for example, DE-A-39 23 967 which discloses a tactile reading device according to the preamble of claim 1.However, a strong demand has arisen for further
down-sizing of a braille type system
