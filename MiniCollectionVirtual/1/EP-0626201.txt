<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst which 
is useful in the production of acetic acid and/or 
methyl acetate from methanol, and a process for 
producing acetic acid and/or methyl acetate by using 
methanol as a starting material through a one-stage 
reaction in a gas phase. Acetic acid has been industrially produced in a 
large amount by the methanol carbonylation method, 
i.e., so-called Monsanto's method. In this method, 
methanol is reacted with carbon monoxide in a liquid 
phase in the presence of a catalytic system containing 
a rhodium catalyst and an iodide. However, it is necessary in these methods to use 
rhodium which is highly expensive. Further, the 
conditions of location of the factory are restricted 
because it is necessary to obtain carbon monoxide of a 
high purity. Furthermore, there is a problem that 
methyl iodide, which is used as an iodide, corrodes  
 
the apparatus. In addition, since the above-mentioned 
reaction is usually effected in a liquid phase system 
containing water, the recovery of the acetic acid thus 
formed requires much energy. Meanwhile, there has been proposed the use of an 
Ru-Sn heteronuclear cluster (a polynuclear compound) 
containing an anion comprising [Ru(SnCl₃)₅L]³⁻ (wherein 
L represents a ligand) as a catalyst for producing 
acetic acid and methyl acetate from methanol through a 
one-stage reaction in a liquid phase [Sumio Shinoda 
and Tetsu Yamakawa, "One-step Formation of Methyl 
Acetate with Methanol used as the Sole Source and 
Catalysis by RuII-SnII Cluster Complexes", J. Chem. 
Soc., Chem. Commun., p.p. 1511 - 1512 (1990)]. However, the above-mentioned heteronuclear 
cluster has a solubility in methanol as small as about 
0.05 mM. In addition, since the above heteronuclear 
cluster is an anionic complex, the solubility of the 
above heteronuclear cluster is smaller not only in the 
acetic acid formed but also in common organic 
solvents. Thus, it is impossible to elevate the 
concentration of the catalyst, and therefore, the 
reaction rate also can not be enhanced. Furthermore, 
it is sometimes observed that formaldehyde is formed 
by the dehydrogenation of methanol and the metal  
 
contained in the catalyst is reduced and precipitated 
by the formaldehyde, which causes the deactivation of 
the catalyst within a short period of time. In 
particular, the catalyst is liable to be deactivated 
when reacted at a high temperature. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a novel catalyst which has a high 
catalytic
