A process for the removal of inorganic salts from 
aqueous solutions of organic salts, acids or nonionic 

surfactants capable of micelle formation, in which the 
aqueous solutions are subjected to ultrafiltration and 

the organic salts or acids or the nonionic surfactants 
are recovered from the retentate. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the aqueous solutions can be adjusted to a solids 

content of 1 to 80% by weight, preferably 10 to 50% by 
weight and more preferably 20 to 40% by weight. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the ultrafiltration is accompanied by dialysis 

with water until the predetermined residual salt content 
is established in the retentate. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that anionic surfactants, cationic 

surfactants and/or amphoteric surfactants are used as the 
organic salts or acids capable of micelle formation. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that anionic surfactants, cationic 

surfactants, nonionic surfactants or amphoteric surfactants 
with a molecular weight of at least 100 g/mole and 

preferably 150 to 500 g/mole are used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the aqueous solutions are subjected 

to ultrafiltration using membranes with a pore diameter 

of 0.001 to 0.01 Âµm under pressures of 1 to 20 bar. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that membranes of cellulose acetate, 

fluorine polymers, polysulfones, polyether sulfones, 
polyacrylates or of zirconium dioxide, aluminium oxide or 

carbon are used.
