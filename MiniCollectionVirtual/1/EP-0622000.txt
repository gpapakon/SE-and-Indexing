<ABSTRACT>
Video images (102) are received by the present invention and processed to directly provide a video output having the appearance of a motion-picture-film-recorded image. The output of the invention may be provided directly for a television broadcast or recording on video tape. Simulation of film frames is provided by progressively scanning an imager (106) at a rate similar to the frame rate of a motion picture film camera. Addition of filtered noise (118) to provide the appearance of grain in photographic film and alteration of the apparent contrast (124) provide variable artistic attributes which are adjustable for the desired film appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
field of video camera images. More specifically, the
invention provides a method and an apparatus for
rendering a video camera image to provide the
appearance of a motion-picture-film-recorded image to
be output directly for television broadcast or
recording on video tape.Two basic approaches exist for recording of
moving picture images. The first and older process
employs photographic film, exposed using a motion
picture camera, which is developed and printed to
projection film which may then be shown using a
projector and screen. Film frame rates for use in
cameras and projectors have been standardized at 24
frames per second, which provides the appearance of
near continuous motion to the human eye. Thirty
frames per second is occasionally employed for films
for television. The photographic film and various
processing requirements to produce the end product
are expensive and require skilled technicians and
appropriate facilities for production. Despite the cost, however, certain attributes of
the film process provide an appearance which is
aesthetically pleasing and, to some extent, may
influence the artistic quality of the recorded
images.The chemical composition of the film and
development processes create the "grain" of the film
which alters the appearance. Furthermore, contrast
of the images on the film varies nonlinearly as a
function of light level or exposure. The combination
of grain and contrast may be varied by processing
techniques and original photographic film composition
to provide the desired "look".The second major process for recording motion
pictures is video taping where images are recorded
directly on magnetic tape from a television or video
camera. Video recording has been designed to conform
to standard television formats. In the United
States, the basic television broadcast format
comprises 525 lines of information, of which
approximately 480 lines are displayed on a television
screen. Scanning of the entire 525 lines is
accomplished 30 times a second. Each television
frame of 525 lines is broken into two separate fields
of 262 lines and 263 lines. These "even" and "odd"
fields are transmitted alternately at 60 fields per
second. The lines of the even and odd fields are
alternately interleaved to provide the full 525 line
frame once every 1/30 second (thirtieth of a second)
in a process known as interlacing. Many other
standards in the world use 625 lines of information,
and interlace 312 and 313 lines at 50 fields per
second.Unlike
