<ABSTRACT>
A rope traction device includes a sheave (20) 
having an annular rope receiving groove (23) and being 

driven and rotated with a traction rope (22) received in 
the rope receiving groove to cause the traction rope to 

be wound on the sheave and the rope traction device 
thereby moves along the traction rope. The sheave 

includes a pair of side walls (24, 24) made of an 
elastic material and formed integrally with the sheave 

for forming the rope receiving groove. The interval 
between inner surfaces of the side walls (24,24) in a 

rope holding portion is made smaller than the diameter 
of the traction rope by a predetermined value. The rope 

receiving groove may be formed in a U-shaped section, a 
V-shaped section of a section which is a combination of 

the U-shaped section and the V-shaped section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rope traction device
and, more particularly, to an improvement in a rope traction
device suitable for use in construction, loading and
unloading and conveying machines including moving scaffolds,
elevators and cranes.A rope traction device is a type of winding instrument
used for construction, loading and unloading and
conveying machines and is capable of moving up and down
along a rope with the rope wound around its sheave by
only one or few windings and without winding the rope
around and feeding it from a drum.An example of a prior art rope traction device used
for moving up and down a moving scaffold for performing a
work along an exterior wall surface of a building is
shown in Fig. 9. This rope traction device includes a
frame 1, a drive shaft 2 mounted on the frame 1, a motor
(not shown) provided on the outer periphery of the drive
shaft 2 through a bearing and a sheave 4 driven by this
motor. The rope traction device further includes a traction
mechanism 6 for holding a rope 5 wound about this
sheave 4 by one winding for preventing the rope 5 from
slipping off the sheave 4.This traction mechanism 6 includes an L-shaped 
pivoting arm 8 provided in the vicinity of a point at
which the rope 5 is disengaged from the sheave 4. A pair
of rollers 9, 9 are rotatably mounted at one end of the
pivoting arm 8 to press the rope 5 inwardly from a
straight tightened state thereof. Another pair of rollers
10, 10 are rotatably mounted on a pivoting arm 11
which is pivotably mounted at the other end of the pivoting
arm 8.There is another type of prior art rope traction
device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. Hei 5-32395. In this rope traction device, as shown
in Fig. 10, side plates 13, 13 which come into contact
with the side surfaces of a rope 12 are made of leaf
spring separately from a sheave main body 11. The two
side plates 13, 13 are provided at sides of the sheave
main body 11 in such a manner that the interval between
the inner surfaces of the side plates is made smaller
than the diameter of the rope by a predetermined value
and the side plates 13, 13 are fixed to the sheave main
body 11 by means of bolts 14 alternately or at opposite
positions in the circumferential direction of the sheave.According to this prior art rope traction device,
since the side plates made of leaf springs are secured to
the sides of the sheave by means of bolts alternately in
the circumferential direciton of the sheave, and the interval
between the inner surfaces of the side

<CLAIMS>
A rope traction device (15) including a sheave (20)
having an annular rope receiving groove (23) which

sheave (20) is driven and rotated with a traction
rope (22) received in the rope receiving groove (23)

to cause the traction rope (22) to be wound on the
sheave (20) and said rope traction device (15)

thereby moving along the traction rope (22), said
sheave (20) of the rope traction device (15) including

a pair of elastic side walls (24) for forming
the rope receiving groove (23) wherein the interval

(A) between inner surfaces (24a) of the side walls
(24) in a rope holding portion is smaller than the

diameter (D) of the traction rope (22) by a predetermined
value, whereby the traction rope (22) is

gripped on both sides thereof between the inner surfaces
(24a) of the side walls (24) throughout the

entire rope receiving groove (23) in which the traction
rope (22) is received,
characterized in that

the elastic side walls (24) are formed integrally
with the sheave (20) and that the side walls (24)

are formed continuously along the entire circumference
of the sheave (20) to define said rope receiving

groove (23) continuously along the entire circumference
of the sheave (20).
A rope traction device as defined in claim 1 wherein
said rope receiving groove (23) is formed in a substantially

U-shaped section with the inner surfaces
(24a) of the side walls (24) which come into contact 

with the rope (22) being formed in parallel planes
relative to each other and extending in the radial

direction of the sheave (20) and with a bottom surface
(25) of the groove (23) being formed substantially

in the shape of the semi-circle.
A rope traction device as defined in claim 1 wherein
said rope receiving groove (23) is formed in a substantially

V-shaped section with the inner surfaces
(24a) of the side walls (24) which come into contact

with the rope (22) being formed in inclined surfaces
defining a radially outwardly enlarging taper (T)

and with a bottom surface (25) of the groove (23)
being formed substantially in a flat surface.
A rope traction device as defined in claim 1 wherein
said rope receiving groove (23) is formed in a section

which is a combination of a V-shaped section
and a U-shaped section with the inner surfaces (24a)

of the side walls (24) which come into contact with
the rope (22) being formed in inclined surfaces defining

a radially outwardly enlarging taper (T) and
with a bottom surface (25) of the groove (23) being

formed substantially in the shape of a semi-circle.
