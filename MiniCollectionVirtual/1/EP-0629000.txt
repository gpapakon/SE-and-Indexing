<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-density assembly of integrated circuits, of MCM (multi-chip module) type, the assembly being of high reliability due to its design and due to the techniques employed in its production. The essential characteristic of the assembly is the presence of one (or more) interconnection substrate(s) (11), in addition to at least one substrate (1) carrying a plurality of bare electronic chips (3,4), these chips being connected to the interconnection substrate(s) by the conventional microcabling techniques, preferably through one or more window(s) (12) formed in this or these substrate(s) (11). Advantageously, the interconnection substrate(s) (11) is or are of multi-layer type. The assembly is intended to then be encapsulated in a hermetic case in a way which is conventional for MCMs. According to several variants, the bare chips can be fixed onto only one or onto both faces of a carrier substrate (1), with the use respectively of one or of two interconnection substrate(s) (11) with windows (12); several sets of two or three substrates thus formed may be stacked, either in a single casing, or in separate casings designed for stacking; the integrated circuits may be conventional two-dimensional chips or ''3D'' blocks of integrated circuits in three dimensions. The invention also relates to the method of production. Applications in the space and military domains, and all on-board or portable electronics with high calculating power or considerable memory size.
