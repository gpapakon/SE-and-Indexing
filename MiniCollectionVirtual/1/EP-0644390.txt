<ABSTRACT>
The cooling water of the compression apparatus (1) is cooled by an air refrigeration apparatus (18). Supplementary (make-up) water which is colder than the water treated by this apparatus passes first through a heat exchanger (8) mounted on the delivery conduit of the compression apparatus then supplies the refrigeration apparatus (18).   Application to air distillation installations.

Process for compressing a gas, of the type in which make-up 
water is supplied to an air refrigeration apparatus (18), 

for the cooling water of a gas compression apparatus (1), 
characterized in that, at least when the make-up water is 

colder than the water treated by the refrigeration apparatus 
(18), the make-up water is put into a heat exchange 

relationship (in 8; 7A) with gas delivered by the final stage 
(4) of the compression apparatus (1), and the make-up water is 

then conveyed to the refrigeration apparatus (18). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
gas delivered by the final stage (4) of the compression 

apparatus (1) is put into a heat exchange relationship first 
of all (in 7) with water treated by the refrigeration 

apparatus (18) and then (in 8) with the make-up water. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
gas delivered by the final stage (4) of the compression 

apparatus (1) is put directly into a heat exchange 
relationship (in 7A) with the make-up water. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the compression apparatus (1) is the main air 

compressor of an air distillation installation, the air cooled 
by heat exchange with the make-up water (in 8; 7A) being 

directly conveyed to an apparatus (31) for purifying air by 
adsorption or to the main heat exchange line of this 

installation. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the compression apparatus is an air pressure booster 

of a distillation installation, the air cooled by heat 
exchange with the make-up water being conveyed to the warm end 

of the main heat exchange line of this installation.  
 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the compression apparatus is a nitrogen compressor of 

the cycle of an air distillation installation, nitrogen cooled 
by heat exchange with the make-up water being conveyed to the 

warm end of a nitrogen liquefaction heat exchanger of this 
installation. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that for the said heat exchange (in 8, 7A) a flow of make-up 

water is used in excess of the requirements of the 
refrigeration apparatus (18), and the excess make-up water is 

compensated for by purging (in 21) from this apparatus and/or 
by evacuating make-up water (in 32) upstream from this 

apparatus. 
Assembly for compressing a gas, of the type comprising a 
compression apparatus (1) associated with a water cooling 

circuit, comprising an apparatus (18) for cooling the return 
water with air, and a pipe (24) supplying the refrigeration 

apparatus with make-up water, characterized in that the pipe 
(24) supplying the make-up water passes through a heat 

exchanger (8; 7A) mounted on the supply pipe of the final 
stage of the compression apparatus (1), before reaching the 

refrigeration apparatus (18). 
Assembly according to claim 8, characterized in that it 
comprises a pre-heat exchanger (7) supplied by water treated 

by the refrigeration apparatus (18), mounted on the said 
supply pipe between the compression apparatus (1) and the said 

heat exchanger (8). 
Assembly according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
said heat exchanger (7A) is mounted directly on the delivery 

line of the final stage (4) of the compression apparatus (1). 
Assembly according to any of claims 8 to 10, 
characterized in that the pipe (24) supplying the make-up  

 
water comprises a selective by-pass (25) at the terminals of 

the said heat exchanger (8; 7A), and in that means (27, 28) 
are provided for selectively supplying this exchanger with 

water treated by the refrigeration apparatus (18). 
Assembly according to any of claims 8 to 11, 
characterized in that the compression apparatus (1) is the 

main air compressor of an air distillation installation, the 
said heat exchanger (8; 7A) being positioned between this 

compressor and an apparatus (31) for purifying air from the 
installation by absorption or between this apparatus and the 

warm end of the main heat exchange line of the installation. 
Assembly according to any of claims 8 to 11, 
characterized in that the compression apparatus is an air 

pressure booster of an air distillation installation, the said 
heat exchanger being positioned between this air pressure 

booster and the warm end of the main heat exchange line of the 
air distillation installation. 
Assembly according to any of claims 8 to 11, 
characterized in that the compression apparatus is a nitrogen 

compressor of the cycle of an air distillation installation, 
the said heat exchanger being positioned between this nitrogen 

compressor and the warm end of a nitrogen liquefaction heat 
exchanger of this air distillation installation.
