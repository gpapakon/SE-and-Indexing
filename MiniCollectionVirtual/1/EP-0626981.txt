<DESCRIPTION>
 ACID ACCEPTOR FOR POLYMERS CONTAINING ACID MOIETIESTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a synthetic calcium aluminum hydroxide, its method of preparation and its use as an acid acceptor in polymers. In particular, the present invention relates to tricalcium aluminum hexahydrate which is used as an acid acceptor in halogenated polyolefinÎµ, recycled or post-consumer plastics, polyarylene sulfides and other polymeric systems containing acid moieties.Background of the InventionMany polymeric systems are known to contain trace amounts of acidic moieties which over time or processing produce undesirable side effects, e.g., color instability, odor, physical degradation, irregular cure patterns or corrosion of processing equipment. In order to overcome these limitations in polymeric systems, a type of additive, generally referred to as an acid acceptor or acid scavenger, is incorporated therein to preferentially react with these acid moieties to prevent or delay these undesired side effects.It is known that thermoplastic polymers, which embrace both homopolymers and copolymers blend/alloys and elastomers, containing halogens derived from polymerization catalysts and/or attributed to the after- halogenation of the polymers, such as olefin polymers or copolymers produced by using Ziegler-type catalysts comprising a halogen-containing compound as a catalyst component and/or a carrier component, or the after 

halogenated products of these polymers, frequently corrode processing or compounding machines during their molding operation, or discolor or degrade the resulting molded articles, because of the halogens contained therei .Compositions of poly(arylene sulfide) also often suffer from mold corrosion difficulties. It would desirable to produce a poly arylene sulfide molded composition which exhibited low mold corrosiveness, improved insulating properties and retention of strength in moist environments.It also has been found that when post-consumer thermoplastic polyolefin articles are subject to the recompounding and recycling process, offensive odors from absorbed contaminants (e.g. milk, halogens) inpart an offensive odor. Further, many post-consumer polyolefins suffer . from unacceptable cross-linking during reprocessing as a result of these contaminants. Acid acceptors may also be used in post-consumer thermoplastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthate (PET), PBT, polyphenyl sulfide, and polyvinyl chloride, which contains undesirable organic acids from' impurities, acidic
