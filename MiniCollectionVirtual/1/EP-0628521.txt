<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
vitrifying soot preforms from which optical fibers are 
produced. Optical fibers or Glass fiber lightguides have been 
used for a transmission path for optical communication. 
Optical fiber is usually fabricated from a preform. As examples of a 
method of producing preforms from which optical fibers are 
formed by drawing, the so-called VAD (Vapor Phase Axial 
Deposition) process and OVD (Outside Vapor Phase 
Deposition) process are known. This VAD or OVD process is based on flame 
hydrolysis and includes the step of 
sintering soot preforms which are a porous aggregation of glass 
particles. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,032,079; 
5,114,338; 5,236,482; and 4,969,941 disclose apparatus 
for sintering the above-mentioned soot preforms.  
 An apparatus for vitrifying, by heating under reduced 
pressure, a porous glass soot preform produced by vapour 
deposition on a seed rod, according to the preamble of 
claim 1 is known from JP-A-04362035. A similar apparatus for 
heat treatment of synthetic vitreous silica bodies is known 
from WO-A-93/23341. A process for thermal treatment of glass 
optical fiber preforms is also known from EP-A-405 580. In this 
process, it is known to provide a SiC layer on the inside of 
a highly pure carbon muffle tube for vitrifying a porous 
glass preform. The SiC layer is chemically polished at its 
surface on account of the reaction with SiF4, which forms the 
atmosphere within which the preform is heated. One object of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus for vitrifying soot preforms for optical fibers, 
which can improve the through-put of the products. This object is solved in accordance with the present 
invention by an apparatus comprising the features of claim 1. 
Detailed embodiments are described in the dependent claims.  
 That is, the apparatus comprises a main vacuum 
chamber adapted to be set a first condition of a 
predetermined pressure; a muffle tube, for accommodating 
the soot preform, provided in the main vacuum chamber, 
the muffle tube including a graphite tube with base and a 
SiC layer covering on an inner wall of the graphite tube; 
a heater system for heating the soot preform, the heater 
system provided in the main vacuum chamber and located so 
as to surround the muffle tube; an auxiliary vacuum 
chamber adapted to be set a second condition of a 
predetermined pressure, the auxiliary vacuum chamber 
attached to the main vacuum chamber; and a transfer robot 
for supporting and rotating the soot
