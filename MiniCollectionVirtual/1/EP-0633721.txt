<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the
inactivation of contaminants in material intended for
in vivo use, and in particular the inactivation of
microorganisms in blood preparations prior to long term
storage and transfusion.Whole blood collected from volunteer donors for
transfusion recipients is typically separated into its
components: red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.
Each of these fractions are individually stored and
used to treat a multiplicity of specific conditions and
disease states. For example, the red blood cell
component is used to treat anemia; the concentrated
platelet component is used to control bleeding; and the
plasma component is used frequently as a source of
Clotting Factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia.Ideally, all blood cell preparations should be
from freshly drawn blood and then immediately
transfused to the recipient. However, the logistics of
operating a blood donor center preclude this
possibility in the vast majority of cases.
Transfusions are needed day and night and it is
difficult, if not impossible, to arrange for donor
recruiting at unusual hours. Consequently, modern
blood donor centers must use stored blood products.In the United States, blood storage procedures are
subject to regulation by the government. The maximum
storage periods for the blood components collected in
these systems are specifically prescribed. For
example, whole blood components collected in an "open" 
(i.e. non-sterile) system must, under governmental
rules, be transfused within twenty-four hours and in
most cases within six to eight hours. By contrast,
when whole blood components are collected in a "closed"
(i.e. sterile) system the red blood cells can be stored
up to forty-two days (depending upon the type of
anticoagulant and storage medium used) and plasma may
be frozen and stored for even longer periods.Murphy and Gardner, New Eng.J.Med. 280:1094
(1969), demonstrated that platelets stored as
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) at 22°C possessed a better
invivo half-life than those stored at 4°C. Thus, more
acceptable platelet concentrates could be transfused
after storage at room temperature. Until recently, the
rules allowed for platelet concentrate storage at room
temperature for up to seven days (depending upon the
type of storage container). However, it was recognized
that the incidence of bacterial growth and subsequent
transfusion reactions in the recipient increased to
unacceptable levels with a seven day old platelet
concentrate. Platelet concentrates may now be stored
for no more

preparation is exposed to said intensity for approximately

five minutes.
The method of any of claims 1 to 7, wherein said furocoumarin
is a psoralen.
The method of claim 8, wherein said psoralen is 8-methoxypsoralen.
