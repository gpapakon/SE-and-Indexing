<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel peptides having 
a nootropic effect and being useful as medicines, particularly 
as antidementia agents. Vasopressin has been previously known as a compound 
having a nootropic effect, i.e., intelligence developing 
effect. Recently, it has been reported that peptides 
seemingly corresponding to a vasopressin fragment, for 
example, those having the following formulae: 
have such a nootropic effect as that of vasopressin in 
Science, 221, pp.1310-1312 (1983) and Brain Research, 371, 
17(1986). Further, there is also reported that a peptide having 
the following formula: 
has a nootropic effect in Japanese Patent Provisional 
Publication No. 59(1984)-93036.  It is an object of the present invention to provide 
new peptide derivatives which are superior in the nootropic 
effect to the known vasopressin as well as to the known 
peptides corresponding to vasopressin fragments. The present invention provides a novel peptide having 
the formula (I): 
wherein A and B represent amino acids; wherein
 
   in the case that A is D- or L-Pro, B is Har or Cit;
 
   in the case that A is D-Pro, B is D-Arg; and
 
   in the case that B is D- or L-Arg, A is Sar, Pip, Aze 
or Arg,
 
its functional derivative, and a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof. Further, the invention provides an antidementia agent 
containing, as a pharmaceutically active component, an 
effective amount of the peptide having the above formula 
(I), a functional derivative or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable 
carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a novel peptide having the 
formula (II): 
wherein
 
   A is cyclopentylcarbonyl, Pro or pGlu; B is Gly or 
β-Ala; W represents a hydrogen atom or a group having 
the formula (III): 
or a peptide having the formula (IV): 
wherein A and B have the same meanings as mentioned 
above, respectively, a functional derivative and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Further, the invention provides an antidementia 
agent containing, as a pharmaceutically active 
component, an effective amount of the peptide having 
the above formula (II), a functional derivative or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The above-mentioned peptides, their functional 
derivatives, and their pharmaceutically acceptable 
salts show a prominent nootropic effect in passive 
avoidance tests using rats, and are prominently 
effective as active component of pharmaceutical
