Method of reducing the susceptibility to tearing of
a heat-restorable material web to produce a cover, which is

formed from a plastics material web comprising a
cross-linkable polymer or polymer mixture and is, more

especially, shrinkable onto a cable connection and/or cable
branches, according to which method the plastics material

web is produced by extrusion, cross-linked, stretched by
heating and subsequently cooled in the stretched state,

characterised in that the polymer or polymer mixture is
extruded at a processing temperature with a specific,

stable or temporary cross-linking density characterised by
the rubber-elastic modulus, and then the obtained plastics

material web is cooled; and in that the plastics material
web is subsequently heated whilst generating a temperature,

which decreases towards its core or towards the side
situated opposite the heat source and is stretched with an

orientation extending over the cross-section of the
plastics material web at a temperature of the core or of

the side situated opposite the heat source below the
crystallite melting temperature of partially crystalline

polymers or polymer mixtures, or respectively below the
glass temperature of amorphous polymers or polymer

mixtures.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the polymer or polymer mixture is of such a high molecular

weight that, following extrusion, an adequate number of
stable-acting cross-linkings still remain during the

shrinking process.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the cross-linking density of the polymer or polymer

mixture is sufficiently increased prior to its extrusion
and/or during the course of its extrusion and/or after its

extrusion by means of energy-rich rays and/or chemical 
means such as peroxides, sulphur compounds, phenolic

vulcanisation systems and cross-linking accelerators on
their own or mixed with one another or by combining the

individual methods with one another.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the polymer or polymer mixture,

having a rubber-elastic modulus within the range of between
10
-4
 N/mm
2
 and 10 N/mm
2
, is used as a parameter for the
cross-linking density.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the plastics material web is cooled

incompletely or completely after its extrusion.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the extruded plastics material web is

heated on one or both sides, in order to generate a
temperature which decreases towards the core or towards the

side situated opposite the heat source.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, according
to which the plastics material web, comprising a

cross-linkable polymer, contains peroxide, characterised in
that the plastics material web is extruded at a temperature

below the reaction temperature of the peroxide(s); in that
the plastics material web is thereafter partially

cross-linked and is cold-stretched at a temperature below
the crystallite melting points, or respectively in the

transitional region from the glass to the rubber-elastic
region of the partially cross-linked plastics material web;

and in that the plastics material web is subsequently only
fully cross-linked in a heat-shrinking process which takes

place later.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
a mixture of peroxides, having variable reaction 

temperatures and variable reaction times, is used.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
a partial cross-linking is effected by rays, or peroxides,

and/or silanes.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
the plastics material web is partially cross-linked by

peroxide in a salt bath or by steam, the network density,
or respectively the degree of the cross-linking with a

given quantity of peroxide, being adjustable by the transit
time and the temperature.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
the partial cross-linking is accomplished by peroxide

utilising a heated calibration with surface lubrication.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
a subsequent cross-linking is effected by peroxide via a

microwave heating process and simultaneous surface cooling.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
the partially cross-linked plastics material web is

stretched to a stretch dimension in a
temperature-controlled liquid such as oil, oil mixtures or

the like at a temperature below the crystallite melting
point, or respectively in the transitional region from the

glass to the rubber-elastic state.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that
heating to the stretching temperature of the plastics

material web below the melting temperature of the
crystalline regions, or respectively into the transitional

area from the glass to the rubber-elastic region, Is
effected by microwaves.
Material web for producing a cover, which is more 
especially shrinkable onto cable connections and/or cable

branches, in the form of an extruded plastics material web
which contains peroxide and is formed from a cross-linkable

polymer, characterised in that the plastics material web is
produced from an extrusion material which comprises a

mixture having the main components 0 to 95% polyethylene,
preferably 60 to 80%; 0 to 95% ethylene interpolymers,

preferably 10 to 20%; 0 to 95% ethylene-propylene co- or
terpolymers, preferably 5 to 20%; carbon black at 3 to 25%;

stabilisers and flame protection at 1 to 20%; and peroxide
or peroxide mixture at 0.2 to 20%.

for example, a hexamethyl-1,2,3,5-tetraoxacyclononane
(HMCN) peroxide.
