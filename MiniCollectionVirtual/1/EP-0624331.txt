<ABSTRACT>
Mounts (10) are provided on the inside surface of the 
left and the right sides of a seat cover (3) on the 

underside of a chair (1), and positioning pins (11) with 
heads and fastening members (12) are provided on the upper 

surfaces of the bases of armrests (2). Each mount (10) 
includes positioning holes (14) respectively having holes 

for the heads of the positioning pins (11) to be passed 
through and slits (14b) of a width allowing the rods of the 

positioning pins (11) to be fitted in, and a support hole 
(15) for the fastening member (12) to be engaged in. When 

the positioning pins (11) are located at the rear ends of 
the slits (14b) of the positioning holes, the armrests (2) 

is fixed to the mounts (10) through the support holes (15) 
by the fastening members (12). Thus the armrests (2) are

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an office chair, 
specifically a chair with armrests which are removable from 
the chair body. As shown in FIG. 14, a conventional chair used in 
offices, etc. has armrests c, c on both ends of a seat b of 
the chair a for resting arms (see, e.g., Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication No. 60813/1985). The arm rests c, c of the chair of this type each have 
the bases e, e thereof secured to a base plate d fixed to 
the underside of the seat b by means of bolts f, f. The 
chair with armrests is manufactured as one chair, and is 
handled as a whole chair throughout in a process from 
storage before shipment to distribution. But to meet various demand, in the above-described 
conventional structure, chairs with armrests c, c of 
various kinds of designs and colors have to be manufactured 
and distributed. To this end, a large number of types of 
chairs has to be stocked, which makes their manufacture and 
stocking difficult, and resultantly their manufacturing 
costs go up. The present invention was made in view of this problem. 
An object of the present invention is to provide a chair 
which can be distributed in the form of a body of the chair 
with armrests removed therefrom, the chair body of which 
can be furnished with armrests of a design and a color in 
accordance with a demand to be supplied, and which permits 
the armrests to be attached to the body by one touch. The chair according to the present invention comprises 
mounts provided on the inside surface respectively on the 
left and the right sides of a seat cover on the underside 
of a seat; positioning pins each having a head, and a 
fastening member provided on the upper surface of the base 
of each armrest: each mount including positioning holes  
 
each having a hole for the head of the associated 
positioning pin to be inserted into, and a slit having a 
width which allows the rod of the positioning pin to be 
inserted into, and a support hole for the associated 
fastening member to be engaged in, the fastening member 
fixing the associated armrest to the associated mount 
through the support hole when the positioning pins are 
located at the rear ends of the slits of the positioning 
holes. In the chair of such structure according to the present 
invention, in attaching armrests to the seat cover on the 
underside of the seat, the heads of the positioning pins of 
the bases of the armrests are inserted into the holes of 
the positioning holes in the mounts from below the seat 
cover, and then the rods of
