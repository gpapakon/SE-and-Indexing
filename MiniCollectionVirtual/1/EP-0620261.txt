<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a latent heat storage 
material composition comprising 70 to 90 wt% of sodium sulfate 

decahydrate, 3 to 17 wt% of ammonium chloride, 1 to 13 w% of 
sodium chloride and 1 to 13 wt% of ammonium sulfate. The 

composition can be frozen with cooled water of 4 to 5°C, has a 
melting point of 10
 to 13°C, has large latent heat at the melting 
point and exhibits excellent long-term performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel latent heat 
storage material composition suitable for use in air 
conditioning systems. Heretofore, latent heat storage materials used in air 
conditioning systems which have melting points in the range of 5 
to 10°C have been considered useful. Examples of the known 
conventional organic compounds having melting points of around 5 
to 10°C include tetradecane (C14H30, melting point: 5°C; Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 53-24182) and pentadecane (C15H32, 
melting point: 9.9°C), which are paraffinic compounds, and 
polyethyleneglycol #400 (melting point: 4 to 8°C; Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-open No. 62-19968) and 1-decanol (melting 
point: 5°C), which are non-paraffinic compounds. However, 
these compounds are scarcely used now, as they have low thermal 
conductivity and a relatively low heat of melting. On the other hand, several compositions of inorganic 
compounds have been reported which are composed of inorganic 
salt hydrates having large heat of melting and melting points 
of around 5 to 10°C. For example, a binary composition composed 
of disodium hydrogenphosphate dodecahydrate and dipotassium 
hydrogenphosphate hexahydrate (melting point: 5°C; Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 52-11061) which has outstanding problems 
in the prevention of supercooling and, which therefore, has 
faced difficulties in practical use. A ternary composition 
composed of sodium sulfate decahydrate, ammonium chloride and  
 
ammonium bromide (Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-56912), 
which although possesses a melting point of within the range 
of 6.3 to 10.1°C, is also not suitable for practical use because 
of its insufficient stability in long-term performance. Another ternary composition composed of sodium sulfate 
decahydrate, ammonium chloride and sodium chloride is 
illustrated in Maria Telkes, SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE (ASHRAE 
JOURNAL, SEPTEMBER, 1974), but this composition has been known 
to have a melting point of 12.8°C. In addition, a ternary 
composition composed of sodium sulphate, water and ammonium 
chloride (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2-92988) has 
a melting point of within the range of 8.6 to 9.6°C. However, 
the freezing point of this composition is low (i.e. 3.8 to 4.6°C) 
and, therefore, since the temperature of the cooled water used 
for freezing the composition is as low as about 1 to 2°C it 
cannot be used in general purpose refrigerators. The preferable melting point of latent heat storage 
materials used for air conditioning
