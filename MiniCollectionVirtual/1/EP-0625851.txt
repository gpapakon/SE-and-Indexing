<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for and a method of reproducing digital 
video signals at a varied speed, adapted to insert information 

about the maximum coded lengths of digital video signals in 
slices resulted from encoding and compression of the digital 

video signals by a digital video signal transmitter so that 
the inserted information can be transmitted together with the 

compressed digital video signal, and to insert slice condition 
information and slice length information in slice headers of 

slices upon reproducing the digital video signals recorded on 
a tape at a varied speed so that the inserted slice condition 

information and slice length information can be deformatted 
together with the slices, thereby capable of decoding the 

digital video signals for macroblocks preceding the macroblock 
involving a discontinuous interval, based on the maximum coded 

length information, slice condition information and slice 
length information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital video cassette 
tape recorder (VCR) connected between a digital video signal 
transmitter and a digital video signal receiver, and more 
particularly to an apparatus for and a method of reproducing 
digital video signals at a varied speed in such a digital VCR. Generally, NTSC broadcast signals are transmitted at a 
bit rate of about 200 Mbit/s. However, digital video signals 
as the next generation broadcast signals are transmitted at a 
bit rate of about 1.2 Mbit/s. For transmitting such digital 
video signals via the channel of VHF of about 6 MHz or UHF, 
the digital video signals are typically compressed at a 
compression ratio of 5:1 or 10:1 in a digital video signal 
transmitter to have the form of bit stream. After transmitted via the transmission channel, bit 
streams of data compressed by the digital video signal 
transmitter are recorded on a tape by a digital VCR. In a 
reproduction mode, the bit streams recorded on the tape are  
 
reproduced by the digital VCR and then decoded by a digital 
video signal receiver to be displayed on a screen. For producing such a digital VCR on a commercial scale, 
it requires functions capable of reproducing digital video 
signals recorded on the tape in normal and reverse directions 
at various speeds. When a speed-varied travel mode or a reverse travel mode 
is selected in such a digital VCR having the above-mentioned 
functions, bit streams recorded on the tape are 
discontinuously reproduced. As a result, the reproduced bit 
streams have the form of discontinuous data bursts different 
from that of the recorded bit streams. This will be described in detail, in conjunction with 
FIGS. 1A to 1D. When the speed-varied travel mode is selected, 
reproduction heads of the digital VCR travel along a trace 
across recording tracks on a tape. Assuming that the 
reproduction heads travel along a trace extending across a 
recording track Fi and a recording track Fi+1 adjacent to the 
recording track Fi, as indicated by an arrow in FIG. 1A, bit 
streams reproduced have an envelope including intervals A 
enabling a detection of digital video signals and an intervals 
B disabling the detection of digital video signals, as shown 
in FIG. 1B. The intervals A and B are repeatedly generated in 
an alternating manner.  As shown in FIG. 1C, each of the detection enable 
intervals A includes an interval portion A1 enabling the 
detection of digital video signals and an interval portion A2 
with digital video signal discontinuously
