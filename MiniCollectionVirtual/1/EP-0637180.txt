<ABSTRACT>
Cellular radio communications system comprising cells subdivided into P sectors, each sector having its own time base, the data transmission in the said system following the principle of time-division multiple access, so that it is performed by trains of data, or bursts, each burst being transmitted for a time interval, called channel, of predetermined order with respect to a reference of the time base of the sector in question, N time intervals forming a frame which is repeated periodically, and, for each sector, one channel, called control channel, being reserved for the transmission of data known as signalling and control data, a separate control channel being associated with each sector, characterised in that the time base of each sector is offset by a predetermined number of time intervals with respect to the time basis of the other sectors of the same cell, and in that the offsets are such that the control channels relating to each sector are conveyed at different instants.
