<ABSTRACT>
A multi-media data processing device has a visual display, storage, and a 
user interface with voice input and a manually actuatable remote control. In particular, 

the remote control and the voice input device are physically integrated to a hand-sized 
unit. Combining discrete manipulatory control signals and voice input signals allows to 

select and annotate transiently displayed pictures. Advantageously, the hand-sized unit is 
wireless.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a multi-media data processing device having
visual display means, storage means, user interface means including voice input means
and manually actuatable remote control means. Multi-media implies a selected
combination among character-based text, film material, graphics, graphs, photographs,
audio sequences, and possibly other elements that are suitable for producing human
sensory experience. Those elements are in some way stored in storage of appropriate
type, such as electrically, optically, or magnetically, and may be selectively accessed
for temporary or transient display. Various fields of application have seen the need for
audio annotation, and also for remote control according to what is colloquially called the
zap! mechanism. A particular field is the viewing of medical pictures produced by
technology such as nuclear magnetic resonance, computer tomography, infrared
scanning, dynamic physiological cinema, and various others. However, many other
fields of use would see similar interactivity features. A relevant publication is EP
402,911, corresponding Japanese Patent Application No. 149,628/89, priority 890614 to
Hitachi, Ltd. Now, the combination of remote control
means and audio inputting means puts appreciable inconvenience on the human user, in
particular, when the two mechanisms are used in frequent alternation, because one hand
of the operator is needed to hold the remote control unit, whereas it is also necessary to
keep his head close to the microphone and vice versa: if the microphone is in a fixed
position, this would detract from the remote control ergonomy, whereas, if the
microphone is hand-held, this will occupy the second hand of the operator as well. By
itself, it is known to have necklace and buttonhole-worn microphones, but the provision
of a second, physically separate peripheral device causes much confusion and
inconvenience. The document EP-A-0 538 794 teaches a computer mouse device provided with an integrated
voice input means for the purpose of attaining a user friendly voice recording function
in a data processing system.Accordingly, amongst other things it is an object of the present
invention, as defined in detail in the appended claims, 
to provide a physical realization of such double interactivity means as recited above,
that keeps the interactivity field to the user as unobstructed as possible, and to also
improve the operability features thereof from an ergonomical point of view. According
to one of its aspects, the invention is
