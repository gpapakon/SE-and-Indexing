<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for use in the production of linear low density 
polyethylene is prepared by contacting a silica carrier with an 

organomagnesium compound in a carrier liquid so that magnesium is 
transferred onto the carrier by precipitation and reaction with 

surface hydroxyl sites on the carrier. The resultant solid supported 
magnesium compound is then treated with a tetravalent titanium 

compound in a carrier liquid. 
On activation, the catalyst is found to be effective in 
producing linear low density polyethylene having a density of 0.930 

and below by polymerization of ethylene with hexene in the gas 
phase.

 PREPARATION OF A CATALYST FOR AND A METHOD
 OF PRODUCING LINEAR LOW DENSITY POLYETHYLENE
 The present invention relates to a preparation of a catalyst for and a method of producing linear low density polyethylene.


 Linear low density polyethylene polymers possess properties which distinguish them from other polyethylene polymers such as homopolymers of polyethylene. Certain of these properties are described in the Anderson et al U.S. Patent No. 4,076,698.


 The Karol et al   U.S.    Patent No. 4,302,566 describes a process for producing certain linear low density polyethylene polymers in a gas phase, fluid bed reactor.


 The Graff U.S. Patent No. 4,173,547, Stevens et al U.S.


Patent No. 3,787,384, Strobel et al U.S. Patent No. 4,148,754 and the
Ziegler, deceased et al U.S. Patent No. 4,063,009 each describe various polymerization processes suitable for producing forms of polyethylene other than linear low density polyethylene, per se.


 The Graff U.S. Patent No. 4,173,547 describes a supported catalyst obtained by treating a support with both an organoaluminum compound and an organomagnesium compound followed by contacting this treated support with a tetravalent titanium compound.


 The Stevens et al U.S. Patent No. 3,787,384 and the Strobel et al U.S. Patent No. 4,148,754 describe a catalyst prepared by first reacting a support (e.g., silica containing reactive hydroxy groups) with an organomagnesium compound (e.g., a Grignard reagent) and then combining this reacted support with a tetravalent titanium compound.


According to the teachings of both of these patents, no unreacted organomagnesium compound would seem to be present when the reacted support is contacted with the tetravalent titanium compound. 
 The Ziegler, deceased et al   U.S.    Patent No. 4,063,009 describes a catalyst which is the reaction product of an organomagnesium compound (e.g., an alkylmagnesium halide) with a tetravalent titanium compound. This reaction with the tetravalent titanium compound takes place in the absence of a support material.  


 In one aspect, the present invention resides in a process for preparing a catalyst for use in the production of linear low density polyethylene, comprising the steps of:
 a) transferring magnesium from a liquid medium onto a solid
 porous carrier in contact with the liquid medium, the carrier
 containing reactive, surface hydroxyl groups, the liquid
 medium containing at least one organomagnesium composition
 having the empirical formula   EnMgR    (2-n)' where R is a
 stable

CLAIMS:



 1. A process for preparing a catalyst for use in the production of linear low density polyethylene, comprising the steps of:
 a) transferring magnesium from a liquid medium onto a solid

 porous carrier in contact with the liquid medium, the carrier
 containing reactive, surface hydroxyl groups, the liquid

 medium containing at least one organomagnesium composition
 having the empirical formula   RIMSR'      (2-n)   where R is a

 stable organic moiety and R' is a stable organic moiety or a
 halogen atom, and n is a rational number between 0.5 and 2,

 the magnesium being transferred in chemically combined form
 onto the carrier by reaction between the organomagnesium

 composition and the surface hydroxyl groups and by
 precipitation onto the carrier to produce a supported

 magnesium composition,

 and
 b) reacting the supported magnesium composition produced in

 step (a) with at least one tetravalent titanium compound in a
 liquid medium such that the molar ratio of the titanium

 compound in the liquid medium to the reacted magnesium in the
 supported magnesium composition is greater than unity, the

 tetravalent titanium compound being soluble in said liquid
 medium, and said supported magnesium composition being

 essentially insoluble in said liquid medium, the reaction
 producing on said carier a reacted form of titanium which is

 insoluble in said liquid medium.



 2. A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the number of moles of magnesium in said liquid medium of step (a) exceeds the number of moles of reactive hydroxyl groups in the carrier.  



 3. A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the ratio of the number of moles of magnesium in said liquid medium of step (a) to the number of moles of reactive hydroxyl groups is 1.1 to 2.5.



 4. A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the organomagnesium compound is a Grignard reagent.



 5. A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the organomagnesium compound is ethylmagnesium chloride.



 6. A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the ratio of the number of moles of titanium present in the liquid medium of step (b) to the number of moles of magnesium on the supported magnesium composition is 3 to 6.



 7. A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the carrier is silica, alumina or a combination thereof.



 8. A process as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the carrier is silica which has been heated prior to step (a) to 750 8500C to remove water therefrom so that the concentration of reactive, surface hydroxyl groups is 0.3 to 0.7 mmol/gm of the silica.

 10. A method of producing a linear low density polyethylene polymer having a density of 0.93 g/cc or less, said polymer being a polymer of ethylene with l-hexene and said process comprising conducting the polymerization in the gas phase in the presence of catalyst prepared by a process comprising the steps of:
 (i) transferring magnesium from a liquid medium to a solid,

 porous carrier, said carrier being in contact with said
 liquid medium, said liquid medium containing at least

 one organomagnesium composition having the empirical    formula RnM9R'(2 n) where R and R' are the same or   
 different and represent stable organic moieties,

 provided that R' may also be halogen and n is a rational
 number from about 0.5 to 2; 


 and
 (ii) reacting said supported magnesium composition of step

 liquid medium, said tetravalent titanium being soluble

 in said liquid medium, and said supported magnesium
 composition, including the supported material thereof,

 being essentially insoluble in said liquid medium, whereby a reacted form of titanium which is insoluble in said liquid medium becomes supported on said carrier.
