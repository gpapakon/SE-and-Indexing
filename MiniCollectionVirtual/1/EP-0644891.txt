<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to pharmaceutical agents for lowering serum
cholesterol in a hypercholesterolemic individual, and more particularly relates to novel
antihypercholesterolemic compounds. The invention also relates to methods and pharmaceutical
compositions for treating hypercholesterolemic individuals.Atherosclerosis is a condition in which abnormal amounts of lipids are deposited in certain
arteries, resulting in intimal thickening. The condition manifests itself by circulatory occlusion,
principally of the coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arteries. Ensuing complications can lead to
coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and some forms of peripheral vascular disease.
These conditions are the major causes of death in the United States. It has long been known that
there is a relationship between atherosclerosis and high levels of plasma lipids, particularly
cholesterol. In fact, hypercholesterolemia is a primary risk factor for coronary heart disease. In
humans, more than one-half of total body cholesterol is derived from de novo synthesis.Many individuals can lower their elevated cholesterol levels by dietary management of the
amounts of cholesterol and fat they ingest. However, for patients who require therapeutic
intervention for proper management of their serum cholesterol levels, only a few drugs are
available, and many of these patients are unable to use these drugs because of the attendant side
effects. There is accordingly a need in the art for agents which can lower serum cholesterol levels
without giving rise to deleterious side effects.The present invention is addressed to the aforementioned need in the art, and is premised on
the discovery that certain synthetic oxysterols are extremely useful in inhibiting the biosynthesis of
cholesterol. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors herein postulate that these
new agents act by either inhibiting or down-regulating the levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme
A reductase ("HMG-CoA reductase"), or by inhibiting or down-regulating the levels of
low-density lipoprotein ("LDL") receptors, or a combination thereof. The present compounds are
surprisingly effective in inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis; the compounds may also have utility
as prophylactic agents for general use against atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.FR-2390960A discloses certain 15-oxygenated sterol compounds and their use to
inihibit the biosynthesis of mevalonic acid. The preparation of the compound,
