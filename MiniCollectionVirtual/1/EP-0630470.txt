<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an in situ probe failure detection method for probes which deliver an electric signal on account of a change of the concentration of a substance to be measured. An example of such a probe failure may be caused by, for example, fouling of the membrane as the relative change in signal may be interpreted as a change in the concentration of the substance to be measured. More in particular the invention relates to a method for detecting the need for calibrating probes, which probes deliver an electric signal on account of a change of the concentration of a substance to be measured, characterized by: (a) subjecting the probe to a stepwise change of the concentration of the substance to be measured; (b) calculating the value of the probe respons time constant tc of the obtained measurement curve with the help of the following main equation (1): tcdy/dt=-y+ alpha 0+ alpha 1t wherein t=time (time), tc=probe response time constant (time), y=substrate probe signal (mass volume

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD FOR CALIBRATING PROBESThe invention relates to a method for detecting the need for calibrating probes which probes deliver an electric signal on account of a change of the concentration of a substance to be measured.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA general problem with probes as indicated above, for instance, dissolved oxygen measuring probes (DO probes) is that probe failure caused by, for example, fouling of the membrane may be interpreted as a change in the concentration of the substance to be measured.Normally this problem is solved by calibrating the probe on a regular time basis. However this solution is not without problems, because by periodically calibrating the probe, the calibration can be either too late or too early. When the calibration is done too early it costs too much working-hours and if the calibration is too late the probe had produced false Values during an unknown period.INVENTIONThe above-indicated problem has been solved with the invention presented below. It has been found that the probe response time constant can be calculated periodically and that this parameter can be used for probe diagnosis. The method is based on the fact that the response of the probe after an instant change in concentration can be modelled as a first order model. The probe response time constant from this model can be used for probe diagnosis. In the method according to the invention the concentration of the substance to be measured is changed periodically and each time after such a change the probe response time constant is calculated. As long as the probe response time constant doesn't vary there is no problem. As soon however as the probe response time constant changes there is a probe failure and the probe has to be cleaned and calibrated. By using the method according to the invention described a new calibration is always done in time.To prove the method Applicant has carried out research with a 

continuous flow-through respiration meter (EP-B- 257057). The continuous flow-through meter measures the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration at the inlet and at the outlet of a closed respiration chamber through which the sludge is pumped continuously [Span ers H. and Klapwi k A. , (1990) , On-line meter for respiration rate and short-term biochemical oxygen demand in the control of the activated sludge process.
