<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control system for regulating the amount of 
torque applied by a starter/generator to a gas turbine engine during 

startup. The control system senses engine speed, compares the engine's 
actual acceleration with a predetermined acceleration, and adjusts 

the torque to the engine so that the engine accels along the 
predetermined schedule. The predetermined schedule is a function of 

the engine's speed or time, inlet conditions and oil temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system for regulating the
amount of torque applied by a starter/generator to a gas turbine engine
during startup.A gas turbine engine includes in flow series arrangement a
compressor, a combustor, and a turbine. The compressor and the turbine
are mounted for rotation on a shaft which drives a gearbox. Coupled to
the gearbox are accessories such as an AC electric generator and lube
pump.To start a gas turbine engine, a starter motor applies torque
to the engine's shaft. As the shaft starts to rotate, air is inducted into the
compressor, compressed and then discharged in the combustor.
Concurrently, the engine's fuel control system feeds fuel into the
combustor in accordance with a preprogrammed fuel schedule to
precisely maintain the proper fuel to air ratio in the combustor. At a
rotational speed of about 10 to 20 percent of the engine's operating
speed, the conditions in the combustor become such that the fuel/air
mixture can be ignited. This condition is generally referred to as light-off.
Should the fuel to air ratio be either too rich or too lean, light-off will not
occur and the engine will experience a hung start. After light-off the
starter motor torque is augmented by torque from the engine's turbine. At
about 50 percent of operating speed the starter motor is shut off, the
engine is now self sustaining and accelerates itself to operating speed.DC motors are commonly used as starters. A disadvantage
of DC motors is that for a given power supply their torque versus speed
characteristic is fixed. Consequently, the DC motor must be sized to
produce starting torque under the worst condition, (i.e. greatest engine
drag), which is a cold soaked engine. As a result, DC motors are not
efficient at warmer temperatures. Another disadvantage to DC motors is
that they cannot dwell at a particular speed or in any way change their
output as a function of energy consumption. JP-A-2131377 discloses a system for compensating for changes in the resistance of a power
cable leading from a constant DC power source to a starter for a gas turbine. Such changes
would have the result that the torque supplied to start the turbine would deviate excessively
from a desired range, and thereby the aceleration of the engine would be too fast or too slow.
The torque is increased or decreased in response to changes in acceleration of the engine
being started by switching resistors in or out of the circuit from the power supply, thereby
increasing or decreasing the current.US-A-3793826
