<ABSTRACT>
The brush (1) includes a core (2) formed from a metal wire curved into the shape of a U and the branches of which are twisted in order to trap between them the radial bristles (3), the core (2) being fastened to the end of a wand (rod) (6). The branches of the core are twisted by turning to the left (clockwise), in order to form spirals which turn clockwise around the axis (X) of the core when progressing from the wand towards the end of the brush, whilst the bristles (3) of the brush form helical sheets (layers) (S) rising from left to right in the zone located between the core and an observer who is holding the brush in front of her substantially vertically with its tip (point) turned upwards.

Make-up brush, particularly for applying mascara 
to the eyelashes, including a core formed from a metal 

wire bent into a U and the branches of which are twisted 
to trap radial bristles between them, the core being 

fixed to the end of a wand, characterized in that the 
branches (4, 5) of the core (2) are twisted, turning to 

the left, to form turns which, viewed along the axis (X) 
from that end of the core which is fixed in the wand, (6) 

turn in the clockwise direction about the axis of the 
core when progressing from the wand (6) towards the end 

of the brush, whereas the bristles (3) of the brush form 
helical layers (S) rising from left to right in the area 

located between the core (2) and an observer who holds 
the substantially vertical brush (1) in front of him/her 

with its tip pointing upwards. 
Brush according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the angle of inclination (B) of the layers of bristles 

(S) with respect to the axis (X) of the brush is 
approximately 35Â°. 
Brush according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
wand (6) carrying the core includes, at its other end, 

distant from the core, a stopper (8) provided with a 
screw thread (9) for screwing onto the neck (11) of a 

container (R) containing the mascara, this neck (11) 
being equipped with a wringing device (12) through which 

the brush passes when it is withdrawn from the container, 
characterized in that the branches (4, 5) of the core (2) 

of the brush are twisted to form turns turning in the 
same direction as the screw thread (9) of the stopper. 
Brush according to Claim 3, for which the 
direction of screwing of the stopper (8) relative to the 

container (11) is the clockwise direction, characterized 
in that the branches (4, 5) of the core (2) are twisted 

so that the turns turn in the clockwise direction about 
the axis (X) of the core, when progressing from that part 

of the core which is fixed in the wand towards the free 
end of the core. 
Method for manufacturing a make-up brush,  
 

particularly for applying mascara to the eyelashes, 
according to which method, after having folded a metal 

wire (
f
) over into a U and after having placed bristles 
(3) between the branches (4, 5) of the U, the branches of 

the U are twisted, characterized in that, to twist the 
branches, the bent part of the U is turned in the 

anticlockwise direction (
g
) relative to the free ends of 
the branches (4, 5).
