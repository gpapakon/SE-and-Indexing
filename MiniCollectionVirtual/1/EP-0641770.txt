<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cyclohexane and a
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivative for inhibiting the
aggregation of platelets, and a pharmaceutical composition for
the treatment and prophylaxis of thrombotic diseases comprising
as effective ingredient at least one of these derivatives.Cardiovascular diseases are increased along with the
change of dietary habits and the increase of advanced ages.
Almost fifty percent of these diseases may be caused by
thrombus.Platelets in plasma are mainly associated with the
formation of thrombus in organisms. For the purpose of the
treatment and prophylaxis of thrombotic diseases in clinical
practice, there have been used a medicine which suppresses the
functions of platelet or inhibits the aggregation of platelets,
for example, aspirin which inhibits cyclooxygenase and
ticlopidine which activates adenylcyclase.In recent years, glycoproteins on platelet membrane have
been progressively analyzed. As the results, it has been
elucidated that the glycoprotein called GPIIb/IIIa is a receptor
of fibrinogen. This has therefore led to the expectation that a
GPIIb/IIIa antagonists would become an inhibitor of platelet
aggregation having a novel action mechanism effectively used for
the treatment and prophylaxis of the thrombotic diseases (Trends
in Pharmacological Science, 13, 413, 1992). The compounds as the
GPIIb/IIIa antagonist include a monoclonal antibody (Ann. New
York Acad. Sci., 614, 193, 1991), a tripeptide derivative
comprising arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (J. Med. Chem., 35,
2040, 1992), amidinophenyl derivative (J. Med. Chem., 35, 4393,
1992; Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 264068/1992 and
334351/1992), and a tyrosine derivative (J. Med. Chem., 35, 4640,
1992). It is also desired to be developed a medicine having no
side effects such as hemorrhage and a highly selective function
as a therapeutic or prophylactic agent of thrombotic diseases.The present inventors have now found that a certain kind
of a compound becomes a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist.Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a
novel compound inhibiting the aggregation of platelets.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
pharmaceutical composition comprising a novel compound having the
aforementioned effect.Further object of the present invention is to provide a
therapeutic or prophylactic method of thrombotic diseases which
comprises administering a novel compound having the above
activity.Further object of the present invention is to provide the
use
