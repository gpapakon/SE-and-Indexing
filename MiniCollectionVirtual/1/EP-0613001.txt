<ABSTRACT>
In the method for measuring the pH of a solution using glass electrodes with simultaneous calibration of the electrodes, the potentials arising on the pH glass electrode and the reference electrode are processed in a pH meter having temperature compensation and electrode slope formation. The potentials from a reference electrode (4) and two pH glass electrodes (2,3), which have different internal buffers (6,7), are processed in a first (8) and a second pH meter (9). From the processed potentials, the electrode slope is formed and, simultaneously, the measured value is formed using the slope.

A method of measuring the pH value of a test
solution with glass-electrode measuring cells and of

simultaneously calibrating the measuring cells, in
which method the potentials occurring at the pH glass

electrode and the reference electrode are processed in
a pH meter with temperature compensation and measuring-cell

slope derivation, which comprises processing the
potentials from a reference electrode (4) and two pH

glass electrodes (2, 3), which have internal reference
solutions (6, 7) having different pH values and which

are arranged in the test solution together with the

reference electrode (4), in a first (8) and a second pH
meter (9) and deriving the measuring-cell slope from

the processed potentials and, together with the slope,
simultaneously deriving the measured value.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
potential of one of the pH glass electrodes (2, 3) is

divided by the quotient which is derived from the
individual slopes of the pH glass electrodes at room

temperature.
A measuring arrangement for carrying out the
method as claimed in claim 1, comprising:


a) a first glass electrode (2) containing a first
internal reference solution (6) 
b) a second glass electrode (3) containing a second
internal reference solution (7),
c) a reference electrode (4),

where

d) the pH value of the first internal reference
solution (6) is different from that of the second

internal reference solution (7),
e) the first glass electrode (2) is connected,
together with the reference electrode (4), to a first

pH meter (8), and
f) the second glass electrode (3) is connected,
together with the reference electrode (4), to a second

pH meter (9).
A pH glass electrode, in particular for carrying
out the method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the

electrode space of the glass electrode is subdivided
into two spaces (11, 12) by a partition (10) and each

space (11, 12) is provided with a reference electrode
and an internal reference solution (6, 7) and is sealed

from the test solution by a common pH-sensitive glass
membrane (15), the internal reference solutions (6,7)

having different pH values.
The pH glass electrode as claimed in claim 4,
wherein the partition comprises a glass tube (16) which

is disposed concentrically in the electrode space of
the glass electrode and subdivides it into two spaces

(11, 12) which each contain a reference electrode (13,
14) and the internal reference solutions (6, 7) and

which are sealed from the test solution by a common pH-sensitive
glass membrane (15).
