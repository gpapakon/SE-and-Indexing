<ABSTRACT>
This invention prevents terminals 4 and 5 from being 
abraded or ground at contacting portions due to vibrations. 

An end of a male terminal 5 is secured in a part of a 
stepped hole 16 in a rear wall portion 12 and the other end 

of the terminal 5 is coupled to a female terminal 4. Even 
if the female terminal 4 is displaced due to vibrations in 

a coupled position relative to the male terminal 5, the male 
terminal 5 can elastically deflect in another part of the 

stepped hole 16 in accordance with a displacement of the 
female terminal 4. Consequently, an abnormal contacting 

pressure caused by vibration at contacting portions of the 
male and female terminals 5 and 4 can be absorbed to reduce 

wear or abrasion between them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector and more
particularly to an electrical connector which secures a male terminal to a
male connector housing.For convenience of explanation, a construction of a prior electrical
connector will be explained by referring to FIG. 12. FIG. 12 is a
longitudinal sectional view of the prior electrical connector.Heretofore, an electrical connector having a male connector
housing 1 in which male terminals 5 are secured by an insert molding or a
pressingly insertion is known as a connector for directly connecting
devices or a connector for a printed circuit board. The conventional male
connector housing 1, as shown in FIG. 12, supports the male terminal 5
with its rear end being directly attached to a printed circuit board B and
its front end passing through and being fixed in a rear wall 12 of the
housing 1. The male terminal 5 is adapted to be coupled to a female
terminal 4 mounted in a female connector housing 2. The housing is
provided on its lower portion with a support base 19 which serves to
horizontally support the housing 1 on the board B.However, as shown exaggeratedly in FIG. 12, in the case that such
type of the electrical connector is used for a wiring in a motive vehicle,
vibrations in the motive vehicle are transferred to the female terminal 4
through a cable W. Then, misalignment of axes of the male and female
terminals 5 and 4 causes a friction in a contacting portion of them,
thereby wearing or abrading the contacting portion. Consequently, both
terminals will be brought into a bad contacting state during long term use. We are aware of FR-A-2 396 438 in which co-operating electrical
contact members are resiliently mounted in bores in complementary
housings to compensate for relative movement between the housings.We are also aware of US-A-4 697 864 which discloses an electrical
connector forming the pre-characterising portion of Claim 1.According to our invention in an electrical connector comprising a
female housing adapted to receive a plurality of female terminals, and a
male housing having a front hood, and a rear wall, and male
terminals attached to the male housing, in which the male terminals are
adapted to contact the female terminals when the female housing is in the
front hood in a coupled position, the rear wall has a plurality of
stepped holes, each comprising a reduced diameter portion
and an enlarged diameter portion located inwardly of the reduced diameter portion in an
axial direction of the stepped hole, and elastic members having

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector comprising a female housing (2) adapted to
receive a plurality of female terminals (4), and a male housing (1) having

a front hood (11), and a rear wall (12), and male terminals (5) attached to
the male housing (1), in which the male terminals (5) are adapted to

contact the female terminals (4) when the female housing (2) is in the
front hood (11) in a coupled position, characterised in that the rear

wall (12) has a plurality of stepped holes (16), each
comprising a reduced diameter portion (161) and an enlarged diameter

portion (162) located inwardly of the reduced diameter portion (161) in an axial direction of the stepped hole,
and elastic members (20a - 20d) having bores therethrough are received in

the stepped holes, each male terminal (5) extending through the bore in a
respective elastic member and being attached and secured to the male housing (1) by a

respective one of the reduced portions (161), whereby the male
terminal (5) are elastically supported by the elastic members (20d) to

facilitate and maintain a good contacting state with the female
terminals (4) in the coupled position.
The electrical connector of Claim 1, wherein the elastic
members (20a) are housed in the enlarged diameter portions (162).
