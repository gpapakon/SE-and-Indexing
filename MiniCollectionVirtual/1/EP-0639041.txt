<ABSTRACT>
An improved anode (127, 157) for a plasma arc spray 
gun to give a spray gun having higher deposition efficiency 

and longer lasting anodes (127, 154) and cathodes (130) 
than prior spray guns. Such spray guns carry particles in 

a stream of primary gas. The anode (127) of a relatively 
low velocity subsonic spray gun has an interior with five 

sections, two of which have cylindrical inner surfaces 
(137, 145) and three of which have frusto-conical surfaces 

(141, 149, 153). The cathode tip (150) is located within 
the anode interior such that the electrical arc between the 

anode (127) and cathode (130) attaches to the anode (127) 
at a circular line at a junction of a cylindrical surface 

and a frusto-conical surface. Relatively high velocity 
subsonic versions of the plasma arc spray gun utilize 

anodes (157) with three interior sections (163, 165, 167) 
and streamlined passages for vortex stabilized flow of the 

primary gas. The primary gas flows in a vortex such that 
the point of attachment of the arc to the anode (157) 

travels continuously along the circular line to reduce 
anode wear. The improved gas dynamics cools the cathode tip 

(151, 179) and thereby increases its service life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to thermal spraying, and more
particularly to an improved anode for guns, and improved
guns for spraying metallic and ceramic particles onto a
substrate.Various equipment has been developed to coat a
substrate made of a first material with a layer of a
different material. Such equipment includes plasma arc
spray guns, in which fine particulate matter is entrained
in, heated, and accelerated by a plasma stream. The
plasma stream is directed to the substrate such that the
coating particles are deposited onto the substrate.
Creation of the plasma stream is normally accomplished by
an electric arc. The plasma stream may have subsonic or
supersonic speeds. Typical examples of prior plasma arc
spray guns may be seen in U.S. Patents 3,740,522;
3,823,302; and 4,127,760.A commercially available plasma arc spray gun is
manufactured and marketed by Miller Thermal, Inc. of
Appleton, Wisconsin, under Model SG-100. In Figures 1
and 2, reference numeral 1 refers to a typical subsonic
version of the Miller Thermal, Inc. Model SG-100 plasma arc
spray gun. The plasma arc spray gun 1 includes a rear
housing 3, a centre housing 5, and a front housing 7. The
rear housing 3, centre housing 5, and front housing 7 are
generally tubular in shape and have a common longitudinal
axis 9. Suitable screws, not shown, connect the rear
housing, centre housing, and front housing together by
means of longitudinally extending holes 11 in the centre
housing and co-operating threads, not shown, in the rear
housing and counter-bored holes, also not shown, in the
front housing. A front cover 13 is attached to the front
housing, as by screws, not shown, passing through
counter-bored holes 15 in the front cover 13. Retained inside the rear housing 3 and the centre
housing 5 of the plasma arc spray gun 1 is a cathode holder
16, the back end of which is formed with a fitting 19.
There is a groove 30 around the outer diameter of the
cathode holder 16 that co-operates with an internal surface
of the centre housing to form a circumferential passage 31.
The front end 23 of the cathode holder 16 is tapped to
receive a cathode assembly 25. The cathode assembly 25
includes a tip 29 and a fitting section 106. There is a
distinct step 104 between the outer surface 107 of the
fitting section 106 and the adjacent outer surface 98 of
the tip 29.Located inside the centre housing 5 and the front
housing 7 of the plasma arc spray gun 1 is a tubular anode
33. The anode 33 has a longitudinal axis that is co-axial
with the axis 9. The
