<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for
detecting a rotation angular velocity using an angular
velocity sensor comprising an oscillator, and, more
particularly, to a circuit for detecting a rotation
angular velocity which can provide highly accurate
measurements and is adapted to mass production.Mechanical rotation-type gyroscopes have been
conventionally used as an instrument for inertia
navigation of airplanes and ships. Although these
gyroscopes exhibit stable performances, they are large
and expensive. It is difficult to fabricate them into
small-type equipment.The use of oscillator-type angular velocity sensors
which detect Corioli's force from a detecting element on
a vibrating object is being developed in recent years.
In these sensors the mass of a gyroscope is vibrated at a
specific frequency. When a rotation force is applied to
the mass, a Corioli's force at the same frequency is
created to the direction perpendicular to the vibration
of the mass. The principle of the oscillator-type
angular velocity sensor consists of measuring the mass 
vibration of this force for the determination of the
angular velocity.A circuit for detecting an angular velocity using an
angular velocity sensor based on this principle is
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open (kokai) 172711/1991. The oscillator disclosed
in this patent application is a coupling oscillator of a
tuning-fork structure which comprises vibrator units,
each consisting of a driving section and a detection
section joined perpendicularly to each other, and
coupling blocks connecting these vibrator units.Conventionally, elastic-invariable metals, such as
Elinvar, or PZT-type piezoelectric ceramics have been
used as oscillators. In the case of oscillators using an
elastic-invariable metal, electrodes are formed on the
metal surface, a thin piezoelectric element is adhered to
the electrodes, then electrodes are again formed on the
piezoelectric element.An oscillator circuit for vibrating an oscillator
principally consists of an amplifier and a feedback
circuit. The following formulas (1) and (2) apply to the
vibration conditions of the circuit,
|α| • |β| > 11 + 2 = 360°
wherein α is the amplification factor of the amplifier, 
1 is the transmission rate of the feedback circuit, β is
the transmission rate of the feedback circuit, and 2 is
a phase lag. In order to satisfy the condition of the
formula (2) conventional vibrator circuits for angular
velocity circuits take a system of acquiring the phase
lag of 360° for
