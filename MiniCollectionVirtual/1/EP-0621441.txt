<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire has a bar grating (10) in front of the light emission window 
(4) in order to protect the luminaire against impacts. The bar grating is secured in 

rubber buffers (20) which are fixed to the housing (1) of the luminaire. The bar grating 
may be secured by a snap connection (21) along a first side (5) of the window, whereas 

it is hingeable in buffers (20) along an opposite side (5) thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a luminaire comprising: 
a housing with a reflector member and means for accommodating an 
electric lamp therein, which housing has a light emission window; a bar grating connected to the housing and protecting the light emission 
window. Such a luminaire is known from DE GM 1 918 784. The known luminaire 
is suitable for illuminating playing areas in sports halls. The bar grating protects the 
luminaire during use, especially the lamp or lamps and the reflector member, against 
impacts of balls. Such an impact could destroy the lamps and damage the reflector 
member, whereby the light-concentrating effect thereof would be lost. The bar grating of the known luminaire is rigidly connected to the housing 
along the short sides of the rectangular light emission window by means of bolts. When 
two mutually opposing bolts have been removed, the bar grating can slide over the two 
remaining mutually opposed bolts accommodated in slotted holes in the grating, after 
these bolts have been loosened, and can then hinge for the replacement or cleaning of 
the lamp and the reflector member. It is a disadvantage of the luminaire that the bar grating is comparatively 
heavy and, partly as a result of this, intercepts comparatively much light. It is an object of the invention to provide a luminaire of the kind 
described in the opening paragraph with a construction which renders possible the use 
of a comparatively light bar grating. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the bar grating 
is held in rubber buffers which are mounted to the housing. Owing to the measure according to the invention, a substantial portion of  
 
the impulse of an impact is absorbed by the buffers. Only a comparatively small portion 
need be neutralized by a elastic deformation of the bar grating itself. Consequently, the 
bar grating may be of a lighter construction, for example, comprising bars of 4 mm 
lateral dimension instead of bars of 6 mm lateral dimension. This leads to a major 
reduction in the interception of light. An advantage of the luminaire according to the 
invention also is that the bar grating is mounted rattle-free to the housing. In a favourable embodiment, moreover, the buffers keep the bar grating in 
position at a distance from the housing. This embodiment has the advantage that there is a greater freedom in the 
design of the luminaire as regards the number, shape, and dimensions of the buffers in 
order to realise the desired buffering action in each and every case. The
