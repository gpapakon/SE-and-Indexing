<ABSTRACT>
An electric conductor (10, 20, 30) provided with an insulating layer (11, 21, 31) and a protective layer (12, 22, 32), surrounding the conductor, in the form of a polymer material containing at least stabilized polyethylene. To said polyethylene there is added a combined antioxidant and voltage stabilizer, in the form of 5,10-dihydroindeno(1,2-b)indole or substituted forms thereof such as methyl, methoxy, dimethylamino or other donor substituents to counteract degradation as a result of electric load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric conductor with a 
surrounding insulation in the form of a polymer material. 
More particularly, the invention relates to an electric 
conductor with a surrounding insulation containing polyethylene 
with addition of a combined antioxidant and voltage 
stabilizer to better resist the degrading effects to which a 
polymer material is subjected as a result of electric load 
or by the influence from other external fields of force. Polymeric materials are influenced by electric fields, which 
results in chemical changes such as crosslinking, chain-scission, 
the occurrence of double-bond formations, gas evolution 
and oxidation. To resist these degradation mechanisms, 
polymers are stabilized by additives. Electric insulating 
material is stabilized preferably by voltage stabilizers 
and antioxidants. Voltage stabilizers, also known as "energy scavengers", protect 
the polymers against degradation by capturing electrons 
which function as carriers of energy in the electric field 
acting on the polymer. To prevent degradation of such an 
electrically insulating material for cables on the basis of 
polyethylene, it is known, for example from US-A 3 629 110, 
to add voltage stabilizers in the form of aromatic hydrocarbon 
compounds such as phthalic acid anhydride, benzoguanamine, 
triphenyl formazan, quinoline, isoquinoline, indene, 
indole and quinaldine in contents of between 0.1 and 10 per 
cent by weight. According to this specification, the voltage 
stabilizer is also supplemented with an antioxidant, sterically 
inhibited thiophenol. Certain of the compounds such as 
quinoline and isoquinoline, which exhibit the greatest  
 
effect on preventing degradation of polyethylene as a result 
of electric load, also exhibit an undesired toxicity. Oxidation in electric insulating materials is initiated and 
propagate preferably by means of radicals which are formed 
under the influence of electric fields. This degradation of 
the polymer is counteracted by the addition of an antioxidant, 
a radical scavenger, which reacts with the radicals 
and interrupts the degrading chain reactions. From EP-B 404 
536, an antioxidant in the form of 5,10-dihydroindeno[1.2-b]indole, 
and substituted forms thereof, is known. The 
antioxidant is preferably intended to be included in medical 
preparations intended for treatment of diseases in which the 
biological tissue is broken down as a result of the 
influence of radicals. In addition, it is indicated that
