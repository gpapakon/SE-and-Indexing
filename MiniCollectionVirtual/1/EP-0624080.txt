<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suture ring e. g. for a prothesis for use in the
surgical correction
of certain mitral or tricuspid valve disorders. There are two atrio-ventricular
valves in the heart. That on the left side of the heart known as the mitral
valve, and that on the right side known as the tricuspid valve. Both valves
are subject to damage that requires that the valves be repaired or replaced.
Clinical experience has shown that repair of the valve, where this is
technically possible, produces better long term results than does valve
replacement. The mitral and tricuspid valve differ significantly in anatomy.
Whereas the annulus of mitral valve is somewhat "D" shaped, the annulus of
the tricuspid valve is more nearly circular.The effects of valvular dysfunction vary. Mitral regurgitation has more
severe physiological consequences to the patient than does tricuspid valve
regurgitation, a small amount of which is tolerated quite well. In patients
with valvular insufficiency it is increasingly common surgical practice to retain
the natural valves, and to attempt to correct the defects. Many of the defects
are associated with dilation of the valve annulus. This dilatation not only
prevents competence of the valve but also results in distortion of the normal
shape of the valve orifice. Remodelling of the annulus is therefore central
to most reconstructive procedures on the mitral valve.Many procedures have been described to correct pathology of the
valve leaflets and their associated chordal tendinae and papillary muscles. In
mitral repairs it is essential to preserve the normal distance between the two
fibrous trigones. The trigones almost straddle the anterior leaflet portion of
the annulus. Between the left and right fibrous trigones the mitral annulus
is absent (as described by Tsakiris AG. "The physiology of the mitral valve
annulus" in The mitral valve - a pluridisciplinary approach. ed Kalmanson
D. Publishing Sciences Group, Acton, Ma 1976, pg 21-26). This portion of
the mitral valve apparatus is formed by the change of the anterior portion of
the base of the aorta into the (so called) sub-aortic curtain, and hence into
the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. A significant surgical diminution of
the inter-trigonal distance could cause left ventricular outflow obstruction.
Thus it is highly desirable to maintain the natural inter-trigonal distance 
during and following mitral valve repair surgery. Consequently, when a
mitral valve is repaired (be it the posterior or anterior leaflet) the
