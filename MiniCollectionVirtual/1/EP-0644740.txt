<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stereotactic
mammography biopsy apparatus for performing
stereotactically guided biopsy localisation .Since the publication of an article entitled
"Stereotaxic Instrument for Needle Biopsy of the
Manna" by Jan Bolmgren et al, published in the
American Journal of Roentgenology Vol. 129, Page 121
in July 1977, needle biopsy of breast lesions to
minimize unnecessary surgical invasion of the
patient's tissue has achieved increasing acceptance.
Guidance of the biopsy needle by stereotactic X-ray
exposures traditionally required development of the
two X-ray film images and their comparison to
determine the X, Y and Z coordinates of the lesion in
question. Insertion of the biopsy needle via a
carefully placed needle guide directed toward the
lesion site could be verified only by additional
stereo X-ray film exposures.Mammograms made while the patient sits erect
before the X-ray equipment may introduce unavoidable
patient movement and resulting inaccuracy, while
conventional tables supporting the patient in the 
prone position with the breast pending through a suitable aperture in the table generally
require a patient's arm to be raised, tensing arm muscles, straining or distorting the breast
tissue and again introducing inaccuracies. In addition, relatively flat and rigid tables often
impose undue stress and discomfort on the patient's joints and vertebra, inducing
undesired restless movements.In particular, document IUS-A-3 973 126 discloses a table assembly for
mammography procedures comprising essentially a patient-supporting platform
with a breast-receiving aperture and a pivoting C-arm which supports an X-ray
tubehead and an image receptor and which rotates 360° around the aperture.The present invention provides an X-ray table assembly for supporting a female
patient in a prone position for mammography procedures, comprising:
a base having a front portion and a rear portion,a rear pedestal upstanding from the rear portion of said base,a substantially flat and horizontal patient-supporting platform having a rear
longitudinal edge and a front longitudinal edge, the patient-supporting platform being
supported cantilever-fashion from said rear longitudinal edge by said rear pedestal, said
front longitudinal edge being a free unsupported edge, and said patient-supporting
platform having a concavely-dished shallow torso-receiving recess extending across its
central portion from said pedestal to said front longitudinal edge,means centrally positioned in said platform recess forming an
