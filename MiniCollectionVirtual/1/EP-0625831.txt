<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver-transmitter apparatus equipped with a signal changeover 
switch which is capable of properly dealing with a high-power radio frequency 

signal and ensuring a desired insertion loss and superior isolation characteristic. 
The switch has a signal input terminal (12/22), a signal output terminal (14/24) 

and a signal input-output terminal (11/21), and comprises a 1st FET unit (15/25) 
connected to the input terminal (12/22) and the input-output terminal (11/21), a 

2nd FET unit (16/26) connected to the input terminal (12/22) and the ground, a 3rd 
FET unit (18/28) connected to the output terminal (14/24) and the input-output 

terminal (11/21), and a 4th FET unit (17/27) connected to the output terminal 
(14/24) and the ground. The gate width of each transistor in the 1st FET unit 

(15/25) is so determined as to render the source-drain saturation current greater 
than the maximum current amplitude of the input signal fed from the input 

terminal, and each of the 2nd and 3rd FET units (16,18/26,28) consists of one or 
more transistor stages equal in number to the result of rounding up the numerical 

value which is obtained by dividing the maximum voltage amplitude of the input 
signal fed from the signal input terminal, by the withstand voltage of the 

transistors in the 2nd and 3rd FET units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a
signal changeover switch such as an SPDT (single-pole-dual-through) switch
which is adapted for selectively changing input and output signals between the
apparatus and an antenna.In the TDMA communication apparatus, there is employed an SPDT switch
for selectively outputting a radio frequency signal to an antenna or inputting such a
signal therefrom. Fig. 1 is a conceptional circuit diagram of an exemplary SPDT
switch . As shown, the SPDT switch comprises four units of field-effect transistors
(FETs) and has a signal input terminal IN, a signal output terminal OUT and a signal
input-output terminal IO.One end of the 1st FET unit 5 is connected to the signal input terminal IN 2,
while the other end thereof is connected to the signal input-output terminal IO 1.
One end of the 2nd FET unit 6 is connected to the signal input terminal IN 2, while
the other end thereof is grounded. One end of the 3rd FET unit 9 is connected to the
signal output terminal OUT 3, while the other end thereof is connected to the signal
input-output terminal IO 1. And one end of the 4th FET unit 8 is connected to the
signal output terminal OUT 3, while the other end thereof is grounded. These FET
units are composed of mutually equivalent field-effect transistors. In this
specification, each FET unit signifies a configuration consisting of one or more
stages of field-effect transistors. The signal input terminal IN 2 is connected to a
transmitter of the communication apparatus, and the signal output terminal OUT 3 is
connected to a receiver of the communication apparatus, and the signal input-output
terminal IO 1 to the antenna, respectively.When the SPDT switch is in a transmission mode for outputting a radio
frequency signal from the transmitter of the communication apparatus to the
antenna, the 1st FET unit 5 and the 4th FET unit 8 in the SPDT switch are turned on,
while the 2nd FET unit 6 and the 3rd FET unit 9 are turned off. Therefore the radio
frequency signal received at the signal input terminal IN 2 is delivered via the 1st
FET unit 5 to the signal input-output terminal IO 1. Meanwhile, when the SPDT
switch is in a reception mode for inputting a radio frequency signal from the antenna
to the receiver of the communication apparatus, the 3rd FET unit 9 and the 2nd FET 
unit 6 in the SPDT switch are turned on, while the 4th FET unit 8 and the 1st FET
unit 5 are turned off. Therefore the radio frequency signal received at the signal
input-output terminal IO 1 is delivered via the 3rd FET unit
