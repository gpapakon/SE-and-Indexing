<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for reducing the ammonia
content of a gaseous effluent from urea production plants.All industrial urea production plants are based on the following
direct synthesis reaction starting from ammonia and carbon
dioxide:
2NH3 + CO2 = CO(NH2)2 + H2OIn industrial plants of total recycle type the ammonia, generally
liquid, and the carbon dioxide, generally gaseous, are fed in quantities
slightly exceeding the stoichiometric values. The difference is
due to ammonia and carbon dioxide losses which, either as such or
in the form of urea, escape to atmosphere and can pollute the
environment.Said losses can be continuous or discontinuous, liquid or gaseous,
the latter possibly containing solid products (urea) or gaseous
products (ammonia).All can result in environmental pollution of a more or less
serious extent depending on the amount of loss and the plant
position (extent of area population), and is continuously
monitored to satisfy local regulations, which vary greatly but in 
general tend to become increasingly restrictive.It is therefore important to provide a process which virtually
nullifies the ammonia content of a gaseous effluent from
industrial urea production plants, so nullifying its pollutant
effect.In said plants, after a reaction stage and a number of recycle
stages the aforesaid reaction leads to an aqueous urea solution of
about 75 wt% concentration which still contains a small percentage
of ammonia which has not been converted into urea.This solution is concentrated to 96-99.8 wt%, during which
concentration a large part of the ammonia is removed from the
solution together with the water, and is recovered in the plant.The final solution, practically in the form of molten urea, still
contains a small percentage of ammonia, which during the final
concentration stage is increased by a further quantity which forms
during said final concentration stage by the effect of the
reaction:
2CO(NH2)2 = NH2-CO-NH-CO-NH2 + NH3
which results in one mole of biuret plus one mole of ammonia from
two moles of urea.After said final concentration stage, the urea solution (molten
urea) still containing ammonia but in a quantity of the order of
0.1 wt% or less is solidified into small beads, the solid product
obtained being known as prilled urea if solidification is by a
prilling process, or granulated urea if solidification is by a
granulating process.Both said solidification processes consist of bringing the molten 
urea, divided into droplets in the case of prilling or finely
sprayed

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing solid urea in a urea production plant, which
process comprises concentrating an aqueous urea solution into a vacuum

concentration section to obtain an aqueous urea solution concentrated to
96.0-99.8% by weight, still containing ammonia, transferring said

concentrated solution to a solidification section and bringing it into contact
with an air stream, whereby a substantially pure solid urea is obtained and a

gaseous effluent with an ammonia content of below 8 mg/Nm
3
,
characterised in that an inorganic acid is added to said urea solution before

it enters said solidification section, in an amount sufficient to neutralise the
contained ammonia.
Process according to claim 1, wherein said amount of inorganic acid
is comprised from 0.25 to 0.45 % by weight with respect to the weight of the

concentrated urea solution.
Process according to claims 1 to 2, wherein the residual ammonia
contained in said concentrated urea solution is 0.1% by weight or less.
Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein said
inorganic acid is sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid.
Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein the
solidification section is a prilling section or a granulating section.
Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein said
substantially pure solid urea contains from 0.3 to 0.6 % by weight of

ammonium phosphate or sulphate.
