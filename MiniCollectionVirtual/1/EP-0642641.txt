<ABSTRACT>
A cryostat assembly comprises an outer vessel (1) within which is provided an inner vessel (5) for containing an item, such as an electromagnet (9), to be cooled. The inner vessel (8) is suspended from the outer vessel (1) by a number of low thermal conductivity support members (17) secured at one end to points on the outer vessel (1) substantially at the height of the centre of gravity of the system constituted by the assembly and item in use and at the other end to the inner vessel (8) at points not higher than the said points on the outer vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cryostat assembly. 
Cryostat assemblies are used in a variety of fields to 
provide a cooled region within which is positioned an 
instrument such as a detector or a magnet particularly 
where it is desired to provide a superconducting magnet. One of the problems with conventional cryostats is 
that they are susceptible to low frequency vibrations 
which, in the case for example of a spectrometer, can lead 
to deterioration in the accuracy of the results which are 
obtained. The reason for the deterioration is that the 
time varying perturbation of the magnetic field on the 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or ion cyclotron resonance 
(ICR) sample which results from the vibrations will lead to 
undesirable artifacts in the measurements made. US-A-4721934 describes a horizontally oriented 
cryostat suspension system in which a helium vessel is 
supported by a vacuum vessel via a number of radial and 
axial straps. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a cryostat assembly comprising an inner vessel for 
containing an item to be cooled, characterised in that the 
inner vessel has a substantially uprightly oriented bore, 
and in that the inner vessel is suspended from the outer 
vessel by a number of low thermal conductivity support 
members secured at one end to points on the outer vessel 
substantially at the height of the centre of gravity of the 
system constituted by the assembly and item in use and at 
the other end to the inner vessel at points not higher than 
the said points on the outer vessel. We have realised that conventional assemblies arrange 
for the various vessels to be supported towards the top 
from the outer, usually vacuum, vessel leading to a 
"pendulum" effect in response to low vibration input. In 
contrast, the invention arranges for the inner vessel to be 
suspended from the outer vessel from points between the  
 
ends of the outer vessel, typically substantially mid-way 
along the outer vessel substantially in line with the 
centre of gravity of the system. A modal analysis of an 
assembly constructed according to the invention has shown 
that the lowest modal frequencies are significantly higher  
 
with the invention than those obtained with conventional 
assemblies. In practice, the one ends of the support members do 
not need to exactly align with the centre of gravity of the 
system, and for example the one ends of the support members 
may be secured to the outer vessel at points situated 
within 10% of the overall height of
