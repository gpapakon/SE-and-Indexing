<ABSTRACT>
A simulated battlefield mine (1) for an electronic 
shooting game provides improved visual effects and new 

challenges for players. A flash beacon (10) is operated 
to flash repeatedly to provide a warning before a 

simulated mine explosion. In a vulnerable mode of 
operation the mine (1) may be hit by radiation from a 

shooting game gun as recorded at a sensor/transmitter unit 
(11). This may delay or prevent an explosion occurring. 

When an explosion occurs, strobe lights (9) are operated 
in a flashing mode, a siren (16) is activated, and a 

speaker (15) emits a sound simulating an explosion. At 
the same time, radiation is transmitted from the units 

(11) to hit players who are in the line of radiation. 
Many variations in the mode of operation are possible 

under computer (3) control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a game of the electronic shooting 
or arena type. Such a game is described, for example, in 
British Patent Specification No. GB-A-2,216,813 
(Haselhurst). Heretofore, the technical developments in providing for 
the playing of such a game have been in the area of the 
body armour or vest worn by the players, in the guns and 
in central controllers. There have also been developments 
in the architectural layout of the arena itself. From a commercial point of view, possibly the most 
important thing in success of an electronic shooting game 
is the novelty by way of new variations which are provided 
to players as they become more and more familiar with the 
game and thus require new challenges. This is 
particularly important now that electronic shooting games 
have become more commonplace. However, there is a limit 
to the number of new game variations which may be provided 
by technical developments in the body armour and 
controllers. It is an object of the invention to provide an additional 
game apparatus which can integrate into existing 
electronic shooting game arenas and which provides for 
significantly more excitement for players who are already 
familiar with existing electronic shooting games. According to the invention, there is provided a game 
apparatus for a game of the electronic shooting type, the 
apparatus comprising :
 
 
   a housing having an appearance similar to a 
battlefield mine and comprising means for mounting 
in a shooting game arena;
 
   a player signal output means mounted on the 
housing; and
 
   a controller connected to the output means and 
comprising means for activating the output means 
to simulate a mine explosion under predetermined 
conditions in playing the game. In one embodiment, the controller comprises means for 
activating the output means to provide a warning of a 
simulated explosion. Ideally, the game apparatus further comprises a radiation 
transmitter mounted on the housing and connected to the 
controller, and wherein the explosion simulating means 
comprises means for activating the transmitter to emit 
radiation to shoot players in the line or field of 
radiation during the simulated explosion. Preferably, there are a plurality of radiation 
transmitters mounted to emit radiation in different 
directions. In another embodiment, the game apparatus further 
comprises a radiation sensor mounted on the housing and 
connected to the controller, and wherein the controller 
comprises means for delaying or preventing a

playing the game. 
A game apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the controller comprises means for activating the 

output means (10) to provide a warning (Fig. 6(b)) 
of a simulated explosion. 
A game apparatus as claimed in claims 1 or 2 
further comprising a radiation transmitter (11) 

mounted on the housing (7) and connected to the 
controller (3), and wherein the explosion 

simulating means comprises a means for activating 
the transmitter (11) to emit radiation to shoot

the simulated explosion. 
A game apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
there are a plurality of radiation transmitters 

(11) mounted to emit radiation in different 
directions. 
A game apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim 
further comprising a radiation sensor (11) mounted 

on the housing (1) and connected to the controller 
(3), and wherein the controller comprises means 

for delaying or preventing a simulated explosion 
if the sensor detects radiation from a shooting 

game gun. 
A game apparatus as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein at least portion of the housing (7) 

is of translucent material, and the housing 
comprises an internal support (18) for a light 

source (8) mounted within the housing (7) to 
provide a glowing visual effect (Fig. 6(a)).
