<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel injection systems for spark-ignited
internal combustion engines.One type of fuel pressure regulator valve for a fuel injection system
comprises a hollow housing that is divided by a diaphragm assembly into
two chambers, one of which is a control chamber and the other of which is
a fuel chamber. The fuel chamber has an inlet via which pressurized fuel
enters and an outlet via which excess fuel returns to tank. The diaphragm
assembly carries a valve element that coacts with a valve seat disposed in
communication with the fuel return outlet. The control chamber houses a
helical spring which biases the diaphragm assembly, with the attached
valve element, toward the valve seat to thereby establish the regulation
pressure. The control chamber has a vacuum port via which it
communicates with a variable vacuum source, typically engine intake
manifold vacuum, so as to keep the pressure drop across the fuel
injectors fairly insensitive to changes in intake manifold vacuum.One example of a fuel pressure regulator of this known type is
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,928,729, which is owned by the assignee
of the present invention.
Another known fuel pressure regulating
device is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,729,360.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,649,884 and 4,653,528 relate to fuel pressure
pulsation absorbers and dampers. In U.S. Patent No. 4,649,884, a fuel
rail has a flexible metal membrane disposed therein to absorb pulsations.
While that fuel rail design does act to minimize fuel pulsations to a certain
extent, it still requires a fuel pressure regulator which is separate and
independent from the membrane. The patent does disclose a plurality of
cylindrical sockets which sealedly receive fuel injectors therein.Fuel injection systems which utilize only a single fuel injector are
known and have been used in connection with throttle body injection (TBI) 
systems. While a TBI system also utilizes a fuel pressure regulator to
control pressure of fuel supplied to the injector, the fuel pressure
regulator is typically remote from the fuel injector.Many types of electromechanical operated fuel injectors are
known and are commercially available. One illustrative type is a
top-feed, solenoid-actuated fuel injector described in commonly
assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,971,254.EP 0 116 742 A1, which represents the closest state of the art,
teaches a conventional fuel rail having a
plurality of fuel injectors spaced the length of the fuel rail and a fuel
pressure regulator mounted to the fuel rail. In this

<CLAIMS>
A combination fuel pressure regulator (10) and fuel injector
which comprises:


a housing (12) having a hollow interior divided into a fuel
chamber (44) and a control chamber (42) by a pressure regulating

diaphragm (46) that carries a valve member (58);
an inlet (22) via which pressurized fuel is delivered to the
fuel chamber (44);
a valve seat (29) disposed within the fuel chamber (44) for
coaction with the diaphragm-carried valve member (58) and leading to

an outlet (26) via which excess fuel is returned from the fuel
chamber (44) to tank;
a spring (70) that biases the diaphragm (46) and valve member (58)
toward the valve seat (29) for establishing the regulation pressure;
an injector-receiving socket (32;232,233); and
an electromechanical fuel injector (34) having an inlet
received in the injector-receiving socket (32;232;233) in a fluid-tight manner and receiving

pressurized fuel from the fuel chamber (44);

   characterized in that said injector-receiving socket (32;232;233) is disposed directly on
the cylindrical sidewall of the housing (12) in a fluid-tight manner and

in direct fluid communication with the fuel chamber (44).
A combination fuel pressure regulator and fuel injector as
set forth in Claim 1, characterized further by a second injector-receiving

socket (232, 233) disposed directly on the cylindrical sidewall
of the housing (12) in direct fluid communication with the fuel 

chamber (44) and spaced circumferentially of the first-mentioned
socket; and

   a second electromechanical fuel injector (34) having an inlet
received in said second injector-receiving socket (232,233) in a fluid-tight manner and

receiving pressurized fuel from the fuel chamber (44).
