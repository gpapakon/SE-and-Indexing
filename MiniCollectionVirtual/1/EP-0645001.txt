<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to the terms 
of a contract DAAL01-85-C-0153. This invention is directed to the field of microbolometer infrared radiation 
sensors. Particularly described herein is the use of a new detector material (ABx) in 
the microbolometer sensor. A monolithic integrated focal plane sensitive to both mm-waves (typically 
94GHz) and (typically 3-5x10-6m and 8-12x10-6m) IR radiation is constructed on a silicon 
wafer by selective anisotropic etching to fabricate microbolometer radiation sensors in 
a linear or two-dimensional array. Sensors intended for IR detection are coated with 
an IR absorbing material. Those intended for mm-wave sensing are connected to 
metal film antennas deposited on the surface of the silicon wafer. In this structure 
there is combined known silicon IC processing techniques with a rugged high-g-load-tolerant 
structure that permits the thermal conduction losses to approach the radiative 
losses of the element. Of particular importance is the combining and interspersing of 
millimeter wave sensors with high performance infrared sensors and electronics on the 
same silicon chip, and fabricating in the same processing steps. The fabrication of novel three-dimensional microelectronic devices in a 
semiconductor crystal, typically silicon has been accomplished by fabricating the 
device through many techniques including isotropic and anisotropic etching. These 
techniques utilize the cystalline structure of a single crystal semiconductor. An 
example is the Johnson et al. US patent 4,472,239, "Method of Making Semiconductor 
Device", assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. The referenced 
patent shows that the technique is known to manufacture micromechanical devices by 
etching into single crystal silicon. The citation of this patent is provided merely as  
 
background and is not deemed as prior art to the specific invention claimed in this 
application. In the prior art, such as US Patent 3,801,949, there has been taught an infrared 
sensitive solid-state imaging device which is small in size and which has a two-dimensional 
array of IR detector elements in an integrated microcircuit. The detector 
array is fabricated on a single crystal silicon substrate coated with a thin layer of 
electrical insulating material, such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. Etched openings 
are made in the silicon beneath the insulating layer wherever a sensing element is desired 
for the purpose of thermally isolating the
