<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a railway goods wagon, consisting essentially of a loading platform (1) and two wheel sets, two sets of double-axle running gear or two bogeys, the suspension being provided via laminated bearing springs (6) which are suspended from spring brackets (3) with suspension links (4). The object of the invention has consisted in constructing the railway goods wagon in such a way that using simple economical means a possible way is provided of moving the railway goods wagon under items to be loaded, in particular interchangeable containers, of raising the loading platform and lowering the loading platform again into the travel position after the items for loading have been picked up, in order to permit the railway goods wagon to be loaded and unloaded independently of loading devices external to the wagon. This object is achieved in that with a railway goods wagon of the type mentioned at the beginning a lifting element (10, 12) is interconnected between each suspension link (4) and the associated spring bracket (3) of the loading platform (1) or of the bogey frame, by means of which lifting element (10, 12) the loading bridge (1) can be raised with respect to the wheel sets (2) or the double-axle running gear or with the bogey frame with respect to its wheel sets (2).

<CLAIMS>
Railway goods wagon, comprising a loading platform 

and two wheelsets, two double-axle running gears or 
two bogies, the loading platform being cushioned against 

the wheelsets or the double-axle running gears or the 
loading platform with the bogie frame being cushioned 

against the wheelsets of the bogies by means of leaf 
suspension springs suspended by links from spring 

brackets and the guidance of the wheelsets or of the 
double-axle running gears below the loading platform or 

the guidance of the wheelsets into the bogie frame 
allowing a vertical displacement and limitedly horizontal 

out-turn of the wheelsets relative to the loading platform 
or to the bogie frame respectively or of the double-axle 

running gear relative to the loading platform, 
characterized in that between each suspension ring (7) 

and the associated spring bracket (3) of the loading 
platform (1) or bogie frame there is interposed a lifting 

element (10, 12) by means of which the loading bridge (1) 
can be raised relative to the wheelsets or to the double-axle 

running gear respectively or, with the bogie frame, 
relative to its wheelsets. 
Railway goods wagon according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the lifting element (10, 12) comprises a 

lever (10) which is hinge-mounted on the spring bracket 
(3) and can be actuated by a drive mechanism (12). 
Railway goods wagon according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the drive mechanism (12) comprises a 

hydraulic or pneumatic working cylinder, an electric 
motor or a mechanical gear system. 
Railway goods wagon according to Claims 2 to 3, 
characterized in that the lever (10) is configured as an 

angular lever [lacuna], hinge-mounted by a central pivot 

bearing (11) on the spring bracket (3), is connected at 
one free end in an articulated manner to the suspension 

ring (7) and at the other free end in an articulated 
manner to the drive mechanism (12). 
Railway goods wagon according to Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the lever (10) is configured as a  

 
double lever and each respective part of the double lever 

is mounted on a respective side of the spring bracket 
(3). 
Railway goods wagon according to Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the suspension rings (7) are 

mounted on the lever (10) by means of a link bolt (9), 
the link bolt (9), when the loading platform (1) is 

lowered, bearing with its contacting surface frontally 
against the spring bracket (3). 
Railway goods wagon according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the link bolt (9) exhibits, at a distance 

from its longitudinal ends, at least one transverse cover 
[sic]
 (9a), which, when the loading platform (1) is 
lowered, is connected, horizontally in the transverse 

direction of the vehicle, positively to the spring 
bracket (3). 
Railway goods wagon according to Claims 6 to 7, 
characterized in that the link bolt (9) exhibits two 

spaced apart transverse stops (9a), which, when the 
loading platform (1) is lowered, bear from one side each 

against the spring bracket (3).
