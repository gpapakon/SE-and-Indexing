<ABSTRACT>
The antitheft security tag comprises a backing film (2) for a continuous, soft-magnetic metal strip (4) and a recording carrier (6) adhesively attached on to the metal strip. In order that the antitheft security tag is not evident as such and looks like a conventional paper tag, the recording carrier (6) is provided with a layer (5) of low transparency on the side facing the metal strip (4).

<CLAIMS>
An antitheft security tag, comprised of a carrier
film (2), an electromagnetic security element (4)

and a recording medium (6) adhesive-bonded to the
security element (4), wherein provision is made for

a first opaque layer (5) in the wavelength region of
the visible light, which layer is arranged on the

side of the recording medium (6) facing the security
element (4),
characterized in that
 the first opaque layer (5) is
an opaque coat of paint or an opaque layer of dia-magnetic

or paramagnetic metal.
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 a second opaque layer in the
wavelength region of the visible light is applied to

the carrier film (2).
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 1 or
2,
characterized in that
 provision is made for a carrier
web (1) having detachably adhered thereto the

side of the carrier film (2) facing away from the
security element (2).
The antitheft security tag as claimed in any one of
the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 the security element (4) is a
continuous, soft magnetic metal strip (4).
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that
 the metal strip (4) is covered
with lengths of hard magnetic metal band (3)

arranged in spaced relationship to each other. 
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 4 or
5,
characterized in that
 the second opaque layer
applied to the carrier film (2) is made of diamagnetic

or paramagnetic metal.
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 6,

   
characterized in that
 said metal is aluminum.
The antitheft security tag as claimed in any one of
the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 the security element (4) is
constructed as a soft magnetic thin-film layer

applied to the carrier film (2).
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 8,
characterized in that
 a hard magnetic metal foil is
disposed above and/or underneath the soft magnet
ic
thin-film layer.
The antitheft security tag as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that
 the metal foil is made of
nickel.
The antitheft security tag as claimed in any one of
the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 the security element (4) is a
resonant circuit.
The antitheft security tag as claimed in any one of
the claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that
 the recording medium (6) is of
a cardboard-like construction.
