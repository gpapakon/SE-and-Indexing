<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic control
valve apparatus used in hydraulic drive systems for construction
machines, and more particularly to a hydraulic
control valve apparatus which includes a flow control valve
of spool type and has an auxiliary flow control function
and a load check function, and to a hydraulic drive system
having the hydraulic control valve apparatus incorporated
therein.As to hydraulic control valve apparatus or hydraulic
drive systems for use in construction machines such as
hydraulic excavators, the following prior arts are known:
(1) JP, A, 60-5928(2) JP, A, 62-38496(3) JP, U, 59-51861(4) JP, A, 60-11706(5) JP, A, 2-134402(6) JP, A, 58-501781(1) JP, A, 60-5928, (2) JP, A, 62-38496 and (3) JP, U, 
59-51861 describe hydraulic drive systems using valve apparatus
which include flow control valves of center bypass
type. The term "flow control valve of center bypass type"
means a valve of the type that a center bypass passage for
communicating a pump port with a reservoir is throttled
depending on the amount of movement of a spool. With the
center bypass passage throttled, the pump delivery pressure
is raised to supply a hydraulic fluid to an actuator via a
feeder passage and a meter-in variable throttle. A load
check valve for preventing the hydraulic fluid from flowing
reversely is installed in the feeder passage.Also, the hydraulic drive systems described in (1) JP,
A, 60-5928, (2) JP, A, 62-38496 and (3) JP, U, 59-51861 are
arranged to be used with hydraulic excavators. Of them, in
the hydraulic drive system of (1) JP, A, 60-5928, a swing
preference switch valve operable in response to a swing
pilot pressure is connected between an arm flow control
valve for supplying a hydraulic fluid to an arm cylinder of
the hydraulic excavator and a pump port so that, when a
swing flow control valve for supplying the hydraulic fluid
to a swing motor and the arm flow control valve are simultaneously
driven, a flow of the hydraulic fluid supplied to
the arm flow control valve is throttled to raise a pressure
of the hydraulic fluid supplied to the swing flow control
valve.In the hydraulic drive system of (2) JP, A, 62-38496,
for the same purpose, a variable sequence valve operable in
response to the swing pilot pressure is connected between 
the arm flow control valve and the pump port.In the hydraulic drive system of (3) JP, U, 59-51861,
for the same purpose, the pressure at an inlet port of the
swing flow control valve is introduced as a pilot pressure
to a load check valve
