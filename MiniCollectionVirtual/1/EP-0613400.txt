<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a test device comprising a plate 
containing a multiplicity of wells. The invention also relates to a 
metering device suitable for the simultaneous introduction of equal volumes 
of reagent into different wells of the test device. In addition, the invention 
relates to a method for carrying out a (bio- and/or immuno) chemical 
test using the test device and/or the metering device and the invention is 
aimed at a kit which comprises the test device and the metering device. A test device comprising a plate containing a multiplicity of wells 
has already been known for years in the form of the so-called microtitre 
plate. The known microtitre plate is of the order of 12.5 cm × 8.0 cm in 
size and comprises 96 wells. The diameter of each well is about 0.6 cm and 
the depth of each well is about 1.0 cm, so that each well can contain at 
most a 250 µl sample. The wells are separated by material barriers with a 
width of approximately 2.0 mm. The known microtitre plate is used when carrying out diverse bio- and/or 
immunochemical tests. In tests of this type, photometric detection 
is frequently used. A very well-known example of such a test is the ELISA. 
In the case of photometric determinations, the bottom of a well must be 
uniformly covered with a layer of the sample to be analysed in order to 
obtain reliable results. Furthermore, this layer must have a thickness 
which is at least such that detectable absorption occurs. In practice, this 
generally implies that samples are used which have at least a volume of 
50 µl. In WO-91/06859 an assay method is described for detecting the 
response or activation of cells including lymphocytes. A method for 
detecting immunological sensitisation in a subject which involves the 
introduction of a cell activating substance which causes an enzyme of the 
cells to become available for reaction and the measurement of the enzymatic 
reaction using a substrate which generates a detectable product and a kit 
for performing such assays are disclosed. Use of a sample volume of 30 µl 
is mentioned as a sample of preference to be used in a microtitre plate 
well with a diameter of 6 mm. A reaction vessel is claimed with a diameter 
of 6 mm and a height of 0,5-6 mm with a preferred height of 1-2 mm. In the 
cited document the vessel is designed to optimize physiological control of 
the reaction allowing adequate exchange of gasses such as oxygen and CO2,  
 
sufficiently rapid pH equilibration, adequate diffusion of molecules and 
dissipation
