<ABSTRACT>
A helical type tape recording and reproducing system records blocks of user data of predetermined size by reformatting the user data blocks into physical blocks that are recorded on tape. The system format includes helical tracks in which user data blocks are recorded and longitudinal tracks for storing address information relating to the physical layout of the tape and to the content of the recording in the helical area. The system includes a partition access bookkeeping feature that stores information relating to locations at which searching or recording has been performed during a current load of a tape in the system, which is useful in accomplishing efficient searching for user data recorded on the tape. The present invention is directed to system search capabilities, including longitudinal searching along the tape and searching in the helical recording area of the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more particularly, to
recording and reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high density recording of
digital information at very high transfer rates. The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous industries
ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these
high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of
storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly
pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create huge amounts of data that need to
be accessed in seconds rather than minutes, hours or even days.Magnetic disks remain the preferred media for direct access to frequently used files
because of their fast access times. However, because of their high cost per-unit of storage (such
as a megabyte) and their limited capacity, magnetic disk recorders are prohibitively expensive and
therefore impractical for large-scale data storage. With the advances in magnetic tape technology,
tape based systems remain the preferred choice for mass data storage. In addition to cost,
magnetic tape exceeds the storage density of any other medium, at least from a volumetric
standpoint, because tape is a much thinner medium than, for example, magnetic disks, and tape
can be tightly packed. A general discussion of such technology may be found in Mass Storage
Technologies, by S. Ranada, published in 1991 by Meckler Publishing.The tape format basically defines the recording path used to record signals on the
tape. There are many different recording formats developed for data recording and reproducing.
A commonly used format for high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multi-track tape cartridge
format in which the tape transport employs a stationary head and records data along longitudinal
tracks. Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan recorders, a technology developed originally
for video recorders, have been used for recording data. In helical scan recorders, the tape is
transported past a rapidly rotating head along a helical path whereby data is recorded diagonally
across the tape. Compared to longitudinal recorders, helical scan recorders generate high
recording densities and lower tape speeds for a given data transfer rate.The present invention is directed to a magnetic recording and reproducing
