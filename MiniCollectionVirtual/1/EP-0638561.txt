<ABSTRACT>
1-Substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones of the formula (I) 

wherein 

R
is alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted 
phenyl or aralkyl, 
 
can be obtained in very good yields by reacting, in a 

polar solvent, an isocyanate of the formula R-NCO   (II) 
with sodium azide (NaN₃) in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 and in 

the presence of aluminium chloride (AlCl₃), followed by 
the addition of water and a mineral acid in excess.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of 1-substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones. Tetrazolinone derivatives can be employed as industrially 
useful active substances such as medicines, agricultural 
chemicals, etc., for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application Publication No. Hei-2-24272, for example. For 
producing 1-substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones, starting materials 
for the above-mentioned tetrazolinone derivatives, J. Am. Chem. 
Soc., vol. 81, p.p. 3076 - 3079 (1959) discloses a process 
wherein an isocyanate selected from a number of isocyanate 
derivatives is reacted with sodium azide in tetrahydrofurane and 
in the presence of aluminum chloride. However, that process has such disadvantages that, to 
obtain a good yield, use must be made of as much as three 
equivalents of sodium azide per equivalent of isocyanate as well 
as of tetrahydrofurane as the solvent. That is a very expensive 
compound, so it is not attractive in view of industrial and 
economical considerations to employ that process.  
 Further, a process is disclosed in J. Org. Chem. vol. 45, 
p.p. 5130 - 5136 (1980), wherein an isocyanate selected from a 
number of isocyanate derivatives is reacted with trimethylsilyl 
azide,but this process has also been found to be inappropriate 
industrially because trimethylsilyl azide is an expensive 
material and about two equivalents must be used per equivalent of 
isocyanate to obtain a satisfactory yield, further requiring such 
severe reaction condition as refluxing under heating in the 
absence of solvent. To solve these problems, there has now been found a process 
for the production of 1-substituted-5(4H)-tetrazolinones of the 
general formula (I)

Ris C1-6 alkyl, C1-4 haloalkyl, C3-8 cycloalkyl,

which comprises reacting, in a polar solvent selected

acetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and 1,3-dimethylimidazolinone, 
an isocyanate of the formula (II)

wherein R has the same meaning as mentioned above, 
with sodium azide in an equimolar ratio (1:1) and in the

water and a mineral acid in excess. According to this process where use is made, as a polar 
solvent, of N,N-dimethyl formamide, for example, it has been
