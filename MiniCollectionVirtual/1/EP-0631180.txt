<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color filter which 
is used e.g. for producing a solid state camera element or a 
gas sensor. Color filters have been used in e.g. CCD and LCD. The color filters were usually dyed by a 
combination of three dyes of the three primary colors or 
of the three complementary colors. As the production method for the color 
filters, e.g. dyeing methods, electrodeposition methods, 
printing methods and resist methods have been used. 
However, dyeing a filter made of gelatin often causes 
problems such as uneven dyeing, swelling of materials or 
cracking. Electrodeposition methods and printing 
methods also have such a problem that a thick color 
filter is required in order to obtain a deep colored 
color filter. According to the resist methods, a deep 
colored color filter cannot be obtained. Thus all of the methods above mentioned have 
some problems. The object of this invention is to solve the 
above-mentioned problems and to provides a color filter 
which is excellent in various properties such as 
resolution, color tone, color reproductivity, and 
color depth.  
 The subject matter of this invention is a color filter having a 
thickness of 3 µm or smaller and, on a substrate, having 
two or more kinds of color filter elements which have 
different colors, wherein the color filter 
element is made from a resist composition comprising an 
alkali soluble resin and dyes having a specific color 
within the wave length range from 400nm to 700nm and 
each of the color filter elements has a minimum light 
transmittance of 25% or smaller. Preferred color 
filters have a thickness of 2 µm or smaller 
and a minimum light transmittance of 20% or 
smaller. The color filter having a thickness of 1 µm 
or smaller is more preferable. The light transmittance 
can be obtained, for example, by measuring light 
transmittance of each of color filter elements formed on 
a quartz glass by a spectrophotometer. Though the method for producing is not 
critical, the color filter of this invention is usually 
produced by a resist method. Preferable color filters 
can be produced according to the following process a)-d). 
a) A resist composition comprising an alkali 
soluble resin, an organic solvent and a dye having a 
specific color within the wave length range from 400nm 
to 700nm is coated and dryed to form a coated film. b) Specific parts of the coated film thus formed 
are exposed to irradiation.  
 c) The resulting coated film is developed by an 
alkaline developer to form a resist pattern i.e. a
