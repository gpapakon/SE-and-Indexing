<ABSTRACT>
Polyarylene thioethers containing recurring units of the formula  [-(S-E-)a-(-SO-E-)b-(SO2-E)c-] in which E, independently of one another, are phenylene, naphthylene or biphenylene, a and c, independently of one another, have values of from 0 to less than 1, and b has a value of from greater than 0 to less than 1, with the proviso that the sum a + b + c is equal to 1 and at least two of the indices are greater than 0, are obtained by oxidation of polyarylene sulfides in two steps, where, in the first step, a polymer in solid form is oxidised using ozone in a suspension medium, and the resulting reaction product is reacted, in the second step, with hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid in the presence of catalytic amounts of concentrated sulfuric acid and/or with the addition of equilibrium peracids. The polyarylene thioethers are suitable for the production of high-temperature-resistant and highly chemicals-resistant mouldings.

<CLAIMS>
A process for oxidizing polyarylene sulfides in two
stages, which comprises in the first stage oxidizing

a polymer in solid form in a suspension medium with
ozone at a reaction temperature of from minus 10°C

to +80°C and a reaction time of up to 2 hours, with
the sulfide group being converted partially or

completely into the sulfoxide group, and in the
second stage reacting the resulting reaction product

in acetic acid with the addition of equilibrium peracids
and/or in acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide

in the presence of 0.1-10% by volume of sulfuric
acid, with the oxidant being added in amounts such

that compounds comprising arylene units and sulfide/
sulfoxide/sulfone units or sulfoxide/sulfone units

are obtained.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
suspension medium used in the first stage is a

mineral acid, an aliphatic alcohol, an aliphatic
carboxylic acid each having 1-6 carbon atoms in the

alkyl radical, a carboxylic ester of these
compounds, halogenated or non-halogenated

hydrocarbons having 1-12 carbon atoms or a mixture
of the specified compounds.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
equilibrium per-acid is peracetic acid.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the acetic acid used is concentrated

acetic acid.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
4, wherein a polyarylene thioether is used which has

repeating units of the formulae:

The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, wherein a polyphenylene thioether is used which

has an average molecular weight of from 4,000 to
200,000 and an average particle size of from 5×10
-6

to 500×10
-6
 m.
The process as claimed in claims 1-6, wherein, in a
further process step, molded and functional parts

are produced.
The process as claimed in claim 7, wherein molded
parts having high temperature resistance and high

resistance to chemicals are produced.
