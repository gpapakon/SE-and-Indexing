<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for recognizing a 
script written character. 
The character is entered using character entering means and digitised 
by appropriate means. The digitised character is then stored in, for example, 

a memory. Codes representing topological vector features of the character are 
extracted from the character, then the topological and vector features of the 

character are compared with a set of reference topological and vector features 
stored in a memory. Each of the set of reference characters corresponding with 

a specific script written character. A logic process is then performed to 
determine which of the set of reference features most closely corresponds to the 

topological features of the digitized character thereby identifying the script 
written character. The relative weighting of the topological effect and the 

vector effect can be varied for different types of script to enable still more 
accurate rec
ognition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for character
recognition, particularly the recognition of letters, numerals and other symbols
such as Japanese characters, musical symbols, simple drawings and the like.In keyboardless input schemes for computer systems, for example,
instructions or data can be input by the user of the system by means of a pen-like
stylus on an input/output screen. An example of such a screen is a touch
sensitive monitor. The input instructions or data can be handwritten script,
numbers, or any other form of handwritten character. In these types of systems
it is essential for the computer to "understand" the input it has been given by
the user and to recognize and read the input characters.There are a number of known systems capable of recognizing and
reading input characters. One such system is disclosed in US 4,972,496. This
patent discloses a system including a transparent input screen that generates
positional information corresponding to the positions at which a stylus contacts
the screen (i.e. the positional information of the character) and also displays
to the user the input that has been entered. The system further includes a
computer which is programmed to compile the positional information into
"Strokes" made by the stylus. The strokes are analyzed to identify the starting
point of each stroke, the end of each stroke, the slope of the stroke, the stroke
centriod, the rate of change of the slope, and where a character comprises more
than one stroke whether it was the first, second, etc. Once the stroke alone has
been analyzed a personalized data base which is unique to a specific user is
accessed to identify the character which most closely corresponds to the
character under analysis. This system is relatively complex to implement using dedicated
hardware for stroke analysis due to the detailed stroke analysis which must
be conducted. In addition it relies on a personalized data base for each user.
This can mean that a large amount of memory is wasted if a given system is
used by many users. If no personalized data base is set up the degree of
recognition of the system can fall to an unacceptable level. Since this system
relies only on stroke analysis it is important for all users to write the
characters in a predetermined conventional manner. Recognition is severely
inhibited when the user adopts a writing style where the strokes are different
from the predetermined conventional manner. Even though the free style
characters may look very similar to the
