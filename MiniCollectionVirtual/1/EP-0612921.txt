<ABSTRACT>
An improved actuating fluid inlet manifold 
(36) for a plurality of hydraulically-actuated fuel 

injectors (18). The manifold (36) includes fluid 
dynamic tuning apparatus (38) for controlling the flow 

of relatively high pressure actuating fluid between 
the common rail passage (42) of the manifold (36) and 

the injectors (18). The fluid dynamic tuning 
apparatus (38) includes a predetermined flow 

restriction defined in each of the rail branch 
passages of the manifold (36). Advantages of the 

fluid dynamic tuning apparatus (38) include improved 
injector performance and/or a reduction in structural 

stresses of various engine components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to hydraulically-actuated fuel injector systems and, more particularly to inlet manifolds for supplying actuating fluid to the injectors.Known hydraulically-actuated fuel injector systems and/or components are shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,168,855 issued to Stone on December 8, 1992, U.S. Patent No. 5,176,115 issued to Campion on January 5, 1993, and U.S. Patent No. 5,033,435 issued to Ostarello et al. on July 23, 1991.In such fuel injector systems, the cyclic operation of the injector and the intermittent communication of high pressure actuation fluid to each injector can i) undesirably add to the structural stresses imposed on various engine components, ii) cause the initial rate-of-injection pressure to be steeper than desired resulting in excessive engine noise and emissions, and/or iii) reducing mean injection pressure.For example, the fuel injector system disclosed in Fig. 2 of Stone or Campion shows a relatively high pressure actuating fluid inlet manifold comprising a common rail passage and a plurality of rail branch passages. Each rail branch passage intersects a respective annular cavity associated with a respective injector. The annular cavity communicates with an actuating fluid inlet passage of the injector which is selectively opened and blocked by an electronically-controlled valve. When the valve is opened to admit high pressure actuating fluid into the injector, intense pressure waves may propagate between the manifold and the respective injector. These pressure waves may generate unacceptable stresses in the cylinder head generally at the intersection of the rail branch passage and the annulus which may cause component failure. Similarly, when the valve closes to block further communication of actuating fluid into the injector, intense pressure waves may propagate between the manifold and the respective injector which again may induce excessive stresses at the rail branch passage/annulus intersection.The hydraulically-actuated injectors disclosed in Stone and Campion have a certain amount of inherent control over the initial rate of injection pressure. However, such control may not be always adequate for meeting future stringent emissions standards in some engine applications.Moreover, conventional hydraulically-actuated injectors typically can have a relatively short injection duration at engine idle conditions. This short injection duration may cause excessive engine noise at idle conditions.Studies have been conducted in the field

An actuating fluid inlet manifold. (36) adapted for a hydraulically-actuated injector fuel system (10) having

pressurizing means (34) for pressurizing actuating fluid and

a plurality of hydraulically-actuated injectors (18) adapted to be supplied with actuating fluid from the manifold (36),

the manifold (36) being adapted to be positioned in fluid communication between the pressurizing means (34) and the injectors (18), and having a common rail passage (42) and a plurality of rail branch passages (44) extending from the common rail passage(42), each rail branch passage (44) being adapted to be positioned in fluid communication between the common rail passage (42) and a respective injector (18),
characterized by

said manifold-(36) having fluid dynamic tuning means (38) including a flow restriction positioned in each rail branch passage (44) of the manifold at a location which is closer to the common rail passage (42) than to the respective injector (18), said flow restriction always permitting fluid flow and having a predetermined effective cross-sectional flow area and length;
