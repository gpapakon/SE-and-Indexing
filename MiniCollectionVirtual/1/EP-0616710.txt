<ABSTRACT>
A signal processing system includes a superior control processor (2) and a number of digital signal processors (4-10), which are controlled by the control processor and normally operate internally with real time applications. A shared data memory (18) is included with a bus (20), on which the control processor normally is bus master, and to which the signal processors have access. An arbitration logic (28) controls the access of the processors (4-10) to the shared data memory. The signal processors (4-10) are directly connected to the bus (20) and normally keep their data and address buses (22) on a high impedance level with respect thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SiÏƒnal handling system with a shared data memory.Technical field of the invention.The present invention relates to a signal processing system, including a superior control processor, a number of digital signal processors, which are controlled by the control processor and normally operate internally with real time applications, a shared data memory with a bus, on which the control processor normally is bus master, and to which the signal processors have access, and an arbitration logic, which controls the access of the processors to the shared data memory.Description of related art.Common to known earlier circuits of the kind defined by way of introduction is that they require external buffers between each signal processor and the bus.Through SE-B-442,352 a data processing system of essentially the kind indicated by way of introduction is known. The system includes a central computer, a bus, a memory, a plurality of peripheral computers, and an arbitration logic controlling the access of the computers to the memory. As appears from page 2, from line 14, in this document, has normally, however, in this system only the central computer access to the memory via the bus, whereas the peripheral computers are disconnected from the bus line.Through GB-A-1,600,756 a processor system is known including a superior control processor and a number of subordinate processors. An arbitration circuit controls all access to a common memory from buses connecting together the subordinate processors and includes address lines and data lines. A bus assigning function in the arbitration circuit provides sequencial bus access for the subordinate processors. A bus access logic in each such processor controls request for access to the bus.US-A-5,067,071 describes and shows a multiprocessor system with a memory shared by all processor modules. A bus arbitration function is arranged in a system control module for 

 controlling the access of the processors to the common memory.The data buses and address buses of the processor modules are connected via tranceivers to the common system bus. The system handles request and access.ES-A-4,499,538 relates to access arbitration for a system with several processors and a common bus. A common resource consists of a number of memories. A plurality of processors can via a bus obtain access to the common resource.Each one of the processors has assigned thereto an own arbitration function.In EP-Al-464,708 there is described a bus system with a number of processors and a common memory.
