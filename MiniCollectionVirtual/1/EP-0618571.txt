<ABSTRACT>
In an optical disk apparatus according to the present 
invention, the cathodes of detectors (D1, D2) of a 

photodetector (8) for generating a tracking signal and 
an information reproduction signal are connected to each 

other at a common connection point (56), and the anodes 
thereof are connected to servo amplifiers (52, 54). A 

high-speed operational amplifier (50) is connected to 
the common connection point (56). Since an addition 

current of currents flowing through the detectors (D1, 
D2) flows to the common connection point (56), a signal, 

which is amplified by the high-speed operational 
amplifier (50) at the common connection point, is output 

as a reproduction signal. A difference signal between 
detection signals amplified by the servo amplifiers (52, 

54) is supplied to a tracking control circuit as a 
tracking signal. The high-speed operational amplifier 

(50) is fixed to a carriage in the movable section of 
the apparatus, on which an optical head is mounted, and 

the servo amplifiers (52, 54) are fixed to the fixed 
section of the apparatus. Therefore, a low-noise reproduction 

signal can reliably be generated, without exercising 
an adverse influence on a tracking detection 

signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk 
apparatus for recording/reproducing information on/from 
an optical disk having recording tracks and, more particularly, 
to an optical disk apparatus having an 
improved signal transmission circuit for transmitting a 
signal detected by an optical head. An optical disk apparatus for recording/reproducing 
information on/from an optical disk having recording 
tracks by a laser beam emitted from a semiconductor 
laser mounted on an optical head, is put into practical 
use. In this type of optical disk apparatus, an optical 
head is moved in the radial direction or the tracking 
direction of an optical disk rotated at high speed by a 
linear motor or a linear actuator, and a light beam from 
the optical head is directed to a target track, from 
which information is read out. Whenever a target track 
of the rotating optical disk is irradiated with a light 
beam, information is optically read out from the optical 
disk. The optical head is provided with an object lens 
for converging a light beam on the optical disk to 
read information therefrom. The object lens can be 
moved in the direction of its optical axis, i.e., in the 
focus direction, and slanted toward the tracking direction 
in order to trace a desired track with a light  
 
beam. The object lens is supported by a focus drive 
coil and a tracking drive coil. Furthermore, the optical 
head includes a focus detection optical system and 
its corresponding focus detector in order to form the 
minimum beam spot on the optical disk while the object 
lens is in focusing state. The optical head also 
includes a tracking detection optical system and its 
corresponding tracking detector in order to correctly 
trace a tracking guide with a light beam while the 
object lens remains in a tracking state. A focus control 
circuit for processing a detection signal supplied 
from the focus detector to generate a focus signal, a 
tracking control circuit for processing a detection signal 
supplied from the tracking detector to generate a 
tracking signal, and a signal processing circuit for 
processing a detection signal supplied from the tracking 
detector to generate a reproduction signal, are fixed 
outside the optical head. The focus drive coil and 
tracking drive coil are driven in response to the focus 
signal from the focus control circuit and the tracking 
signal from the tracking control circuit, and the object 
lens is kept in the focus and tracking states. In these 
states, the reproduction signal is
