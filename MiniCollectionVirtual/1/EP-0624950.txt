<ABSTRACT>
A delay matching circuit has a first node (48), a second node 
(50), a first loading circuit (54, 56), a second loading circuit (58, 

60), a third loading circuit (64) and a buffer circuit (62). The first 
loading circuit couples a first logic state to the first node 

responsive to a first state of a control signal. The second loading 
circuit couples a second logic state to the first node responsive to a 

second state of the control signal. The buffer circuit electrically 
couples the first and second nodes. The first loading circuit, second 

loading circuit and buffer circuit are characterized by a first, a 
second and a third predetermined electrical impedance, respectively. 

The third loading circuit is coupled to the second node and is 
characterized by a fourth predetermined electrical impedance. The 

disclosed delay matching circuit propagates a clock signal input 
with a delay equal to the Clock-to-Q delay associated with a flip-flop 

constructed with similar circuit elements. The disclosed delay 
matching circuit is useful in circuits, such as phase locked loops, 

where the simultaneous propagation of two signals is critical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to digital circuits, and
more specifically to a delay circuit for use with a flip-flop.Flip-flops are one of the fundamental circuit blocks used by
digital circuit designers. The term flip-flop refers, generically, to a
device that receives either a logic high or logic low state as an input
and saves the input for use at some later time. Typically, a flip-flop
samples and saves its input at a time indicated by a clocking signal.
Otherwise, the flip-flop ignores the logic state at its input. Flip-flops
are generally the simplest example of a binary memory circuit.Flip-flops are often used in applications where signal
propagation delays are critical. For instance, a phase locked loop
(hereafter simply "PLL") is a device that synchronizes an output
clock signal to a master or input clock signal in both phase and
frequency. The output clock signal is fed back to an input of the PLL
where the phase and frequency of the output clock signal are
continuously compared to the phase and frequency of the master
clock signal. Therefore, a PLL generates an output clock signal
slaved to a master clock signal. A PLL may be modified to generate
an output clock signal whose frequency is a particular ratio of the
frequency of the input clock signal. Such a circuit is useful in data
processors that use an internal clock signal that has a higher
frequency than the frequency of an input bus clock signal. A designer 
may control the ratio of the bus and internal clock frequencies by
inserting a circuit that reduces the frequency of the signal in the
PLL feedback loop by a certain factor, typically, two, four six, eight,
etc.. The PLL synchronizes the input clock signal and the "reduced
frequency" clock output. Therefore, the input to the frequency
reducing circuit is two, four six, eight times, etc., greater than the
frequency of the input clock signal. The input to the frequency
reducing circuit is then used as the "output" of the PLL.Flip-flops are often used to build the frequency reducing
circuits described above. Unfortunately, a frequency reducing
circuit incorporating a flip-flop introduces delay into the feedback
loop of the PLL. This delay causes the two clock signals to become
misaligned with respect to phase if the input of the frequency
reducing circuit generates the output of the PLL. In some
applications this delay may be unacceptable. Also, this delay may be
so small that it may not be possible to model the delay prior to
circuit manufacture with enough accuracy to design
