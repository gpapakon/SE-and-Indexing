<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an energetic composition, a 
process for its preparation and its uses. More particularly it relates to 
azidohydrocarbons such as 1,6-diazidohexane, an energetic diazidoalkane 
useful as a component in a propellant or combustion system. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide energetic 
azidohydrocarbons which are relatively insensitive to impact and are 
thermally stable. Another object of this invention is to provide a process of 
preparation of the diazidoalkane 1,6-diazidohexane with the aforementioned 
properties.  According to the invention, these and other objects are attained by 
providing a process for producing azidohydrocarbons comprising introducing 
at ambient temperature and pressure into a suitable reaction vessel 
kerosene as a reactant carrier. To the kerosene is admixed sodium azide 
and a phase transfer catalyst followed by the addition of halogenated 
hydrocarbons under controlled conditions, reacting the mixture and 
recovering the reaction product azidohydrocarbon. The preferred class Of phase transfer catalysts comprises 
tetraalkylammonium and tetraalkylphosphonium salts which include 
tetrabutylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium bromide, 
tetrabutylammonium azide, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 
methyltributylammonium chloride, methyltributylammonium azide, 
tricaprylmethylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium azide, 
tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylphosphonium chloride, 
tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, tetrabutylphosphonium azide, 
tetrapropylphosphonium chloride, tetrapropylphosphonium bromide, and 
tetrapropylphosphonium azide. Although the azidohydrocarbon of the present invention may be 
prepared as described above, there are some recommended steps to be 
followed if a product of high purity and yield is to be realized. The 
product and process of the invention are further described and illustrated 
by the example hereinunder set forth.  In a suitable reaction vessel equipped with a stirrer and heater 
element was introduced at ambient temperature and pressure about 100 grams 
of kerosene of C₁₂ to C₁₈. To the kerosene was next added sodium azide 
(NaN₃) (71 gm. 1.09 mole or 2.4% excess) and 31 grams (0.11 mole) of 
tetrabutylammonium azide [CH₃(CH₂)₃]₄N-N₃ to form a slurry. 
Next, 81 grams (0.523 mole) of 1,6 dichlorohexane [Cl(CH₂)₆Cl] was 
added to the slurry mixture over a period of about 25 minutes. The 
reaction was initiated at about 100°C for about 45 minutes and then at 
105°C for about 2 hours
