<ABSTRACT>
The cassette (box, case) is used for the storage of articles, in particular tools such as cutting tools, drilling tools and the like, and comprises a cassette lower part (1) formed of front wall (2), rear wall (3), two side walls (4) and a bottom part (5), furthermore a lid part (6) hingedly connected to the rear wall (3), and at least one insert part (7) which is arranged in the cassette lower part (1) between the side walls (4), is adjacent to the front wall (2) and can be fully extended out of the cassette lower part. Connected to the insert part (7) are at least two cantilever arms (9) which run parallel to the side walls (4) and at their free end have a stop face (10), limiting the extending movement, for a projection (11) protruding from the side wall (4) at the upper edge. The projection (11) at the same time forms the boundary, opposite the front wall (2), for the insert part (7). At their underside facing the bottom part (5), the cantilever arms (9) are each provided with a cutout (12) into which the upper edge of the front wall (2) reaches when the insert part (7) is extended.

A case for the storage of articles, in particular tools such as 
cutting tools, drilling tools and the like, comprising a case bottom member 

(1) formed from a front wall (2), a rear wall (3), two side walls (4) and a 
bottom portion (5), a lid member (6) hingedly connected to the rear wall 

(3) and at least one insert member (7) which is arranged in the case bottom 
member (1) between the side walls (4) and which adjoins the front wall (2) 

and which can be completely extended out of the cassette bottom member, 
characterised in that connected to the insert member (7) are at least two 

cantilever arms (9) which extend parallel to the side walls (4) and which 
at their free end have an abutment surface (10), which limits the extension 

movement of the insert member, for a projection (11) which projects at the 
upper edge from the side wall (4), wherein the projection (11) at the same 

time forms the delimitation, which is opposite to the front wall (2), for 
the insert member (7), and that at their underside which faces towards the 

bottom portion (5) the cantilever arms (9) each have a respective recess 
(12) into which the upper edge of the front wall (2) engages when the 

insert member (7) is extended. 
A case according to claim 1 characterised in that the part of 
the cantilever arm (9) which extends beneath the insert member (7), at its 

lower edge, forms an inclined contact runner (13) which extends as far as 
the recess (12). 
A case according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the 
recess (12) is arranged in the edge region of the insert member (7). 
A case according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 

the cantilever arms (9) are in the form of angle profiles in the region 
which extends beneath the insert member (7). 
A case according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that 
the insert member (7) is provided with a handle element (14) for lifting it 

out of the case bottom member (1).  
 
A case according to claim 5 characterised in that the handle 
element (14) is connected to two lug portions (15) which project downwardly 

at the front edge of the insert member (7), wherein the front wall (2) of 
the case bottom member (1) is provided with a recess (16) in the region of 

the lug portions (15). 
A case according to claim 6 characterised in that the two lug 
portions (15) are provided at their lower free edge with a slightly angled 

part (17) which is directed towards the cantilever arms (9). 
A case according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in that the 
lug portions (15) are cut free from the bottom of the insert member (7) and 

are positioned at a right angle. 
A case according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that 
arranged on the cantilever arm (9) is an entrainment finger (19) for 

raising a pivotal insert (18) for receiving tools, which pivotal insert 
(18) is hingedly connected in the case bottom member (1) in the region of 

the front wall (2). 
A case according to claim 9 characterised in that the pivotal 
insert (18) is provided with laterally projecting mounting tongues which 

are held in mounting plates (21) provided with mounting openings (20). 
A case according to claim 10 characterised in that disposed 
beneath the pivotal insert (18) is a support portion (22) which is also 

held by mounting tongues in the mounting openings (20) and which, at its 
edge remote from the mounting tongues, has an abutment bar (23) which is 

bent up at a right angle, for the tools.
