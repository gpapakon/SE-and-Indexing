<ABSTRACT>
An automatic process is disclosed for controlling a device for cutting curves in a textile web along a cutting line that defines a periodically repetitive pattern (M) comprising two pattern segments. Different control strategies are used for critical and non-critical pattern segments (MS2, MS4, MS1, MS3, MS5). In non-critical pattern segments (MS1, MS3, MS5), the cutting head (10) of the curve cutting device is controlled on the basis of the detected relative position of the cutting head (10) with respect to the light slit (LS) of the textile web (TB). When critical pattern segments (MS2, MS4) are reached, however, the mode of operation is switched and the cutting head (10) is controlled on the basis of stored relative displacement values from the moment the end point of the preceding non-critical pattern segment (MS1, MS3, MS5) is reached.
