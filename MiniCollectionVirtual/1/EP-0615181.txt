<ABSTRACT>
It is the object of the invention to use a drive for a drafting machine which is more cost-effective and, at the same time, achieves higher automation and a higher precision for setting the speed ratios between the operational elements. The total drive power is distributed, with respect to operational elements of a drafting machine, between a main motor 5 and a plurality of separate motors 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The distribution of the drive power is carried out in such a way that the main motor 5 delivers a constant drive power, which represents the larger proportion of the total drive power. All the separate motors 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, which supply selectably variable drive power, together supply the smaller proportion of the total drive power. In device terms, the mechanical transmission coupling of all operational elements with each other is coupled at the same time with individual drives for all operational elements.
