<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (60) is provided for 
insulation displacing termination of ribbon cable (12) 

having conductors (14) in predetermined close centerline 
spacing. The connector includes a dielectric housing (15) 

having a mating face (20), an opposed cable-receiving face 
(22) and a plurality of terminal-receiving passages (24) 

extending between the faces for receiving a plurality of 
terminals (26). Each terminal includes a mating portion 

(28) toward the mating face and slotted U-shaped insulation 
displacement portion (30) toward the cable-receiving face. 

The insulation displacement portions of the terminals are 
arranged staggered in at least two rows. A dielectric 

cover (62) forces the conductors into the U-shaped 
insulation displacement portions and embraces the cable 

between the cover and the cable-receiving face of the 
housing. The cover includes a surface (74, 78, 80, 82) for 

engaging the cable and holes (72) in the surface for 
receiving the U-shaped insulation displacement portions of 

the terminals. Recessed areas (90) are provided adjacent 
the holes in the cover which receive the insulation 

displacement portions of the terminals. Therefore, the 
conductors on opposite sides of any given conductor being 

terminated can float into the recessed areas as a 
respective insulation displacement portion is forced into 

termination with the given conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical
connector assembly for terminating a multi-conductor flat
cable such as a ribbon cable.Electrical connectors have been provided in a
wide variety of configurations for terminating multi-conductor
cables such as integral flat or ribbon cables.
With the ever-increasing miniaturization of electrical
connectors and the ever-increasing numbers of wires in
multi-conductor cables, electrical connectors of the
character described have become increasingly complicated in
order to accommodate relatively large numbers of conductors
terminated in relatively small connectors. For instance,
a ribbon cable may have conductors on close centerline
spacing on the order of 0.064 cms (25 mils). Connectors
for such high density ribbon cables are used in a variety
of applications, such as installing disk drives in small
computers.Most electrical connectors for terminating ribbon
cables are of the insulation displacing termination type.
These connectors generally include a housing having a
mating face, an opposed cable-receiving face, and at least
two rows of terminal-receiving passages extending between
the faces. A plurality of terminals, most often stamped
and formed of sheet metal material, are received in
respective passages, each terminal having a mating portion
toward the mating face of the housing and a generally U-shaped 
insulation displacement portion toward the cable-receiving
face of the housing. Some form of secondary
housing component, such as a cover, is provided for forcing
conductors of the ribbon cable into the U-shaped insulation
displacement portions of the terminals, with the cover
embracing the ribbon cable between the cover and the cable-receiving
face of the housing. Such a connector is disclosed in US-A-5 118 306.One of the problems with connectors of the
character described immediately above, centers around the
high density of the conductors in the ribbon cable.
Because of the close spacing of the conductors, the
insulation displacement portions of the terminals are
arranged in two generally spaced-apart staggered rows with
adjacent terminals located in opposite rows. Therefore, a
conductor to be terminated in an insulation displacement
portion located in a back row will necessarily have to pass
between two insulation displacement portions located in a
front row. Such close spacing may create problems and may
result in shorting, especially since the narrow insulation
displacement beams of a
