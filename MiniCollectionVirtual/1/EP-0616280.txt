<ABSTRACT>
A clock switcher circuit for providing at least one 
set of clock signals selected from a plurality of clock 

sources. A first clock signal having a first pulse 
length and a second clock signal having a second pulse 

length are circuit inputs. Another circuit input is a 
clock selection input. When the clock selection input 

indicates a new output clock signal, different from the 
then current output clock signal, should be output by the 

circuit, the circuit provides a means for switching to 
output the new output clock signal. In switching to 

output the new output clock signal, the circuit prevents 
the occurrence of the output clock signal ever having a 

pulse shorter than the normal pulse length of the then 
current output clock signal, whether the then current 

output clock signal is the first clock signal or the 
second clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a clock switcher electrical 
circuit which allows for switching between clock signals 
of a plurality of clock signal sources,
 
such as a clock switcher circuit which allows 
for switching between clock signals of the plurality of 
clock signal sources without resulting in arbitrarily 
short clock pulses. In digital electronic circuits, clock sources 
provide pulsed timing signals which allow for appropriate 
timing and ordering of events occurring within the 
circuits. It is desirable in certain of those circuits 
to allow the clock source for the circuit to be switched 
from time to time between any of a plurality of clock 
sources. It is hard, if not impossible, to exactly 
synchronize timing signals generated by more than one  
 
clock. Therefore, switching between clock sources can 
result in arbitrarily shortened or lengthened pulses 
during the switch. The problem with arbitrarily shortened or lengthened 
pulses during a switch between clock sources is that 
operations within particular circuits may necessarily 
depend upon an absolute time, i.e., pulse length, for 
appropriate completion of the steps of those operations. 
For example, in the case of a shortened clock pulse 
during a switch between clock sources, some flip flops of 
a certain circuit block will see the pulse but others may 
not since the pulse is shorter than the normal pulse. 
This problem could be prevented if one could sufficiently 
study the circuit block to confirm that all flip flops 
will see every possible arbitrarily shortened pulse; 
however, such a study is not practical in most cases and 
may even be impossible. A lengthened pulse typically 
does not present the problems which may result in the 
case of a shortened pulse. It is, therefore, in most 
cases suitable to have arbitrarily lengthened pulses and 
still guarantee appropriate circuit block operation 
Arbitrarily shortened clock pulses, on the other hand, 
are a problem. Others have attempted to resolve the problem of 
arbitrarily shortened clock pulses during switching  
 
between clock sources. One example of such an attempt 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,099,140 to Mudgett. That 
patent discloses a synchronizing circuit, responsive to 
a detector for disabling a gate in synchronism with the 
old clock source and thereafter enabling the gate in 
synchronism with a new clock source. In the case of that 
solution, synchrony of the signals from the clock sources 
is mimicked by the particular circuit due to the 
disabling and then
