<DESCRIPTION>
 TERMINAL SELF-RELEASING FLUID RESERVOIRFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention generally pertains to a capping device forconnectable tubing used in medical procedures, and more specifically,to a capping device containing a fluid reservoir releasabie when joinedto a connector in fluid communication with a patient catheter or a fluidadministration set, for example.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVarious medical procedures involve the intermittentadministration of drugs or fluids through medical tubing to a patientcatheter. This allows the patient to be ambulatory between and/orduring the medical procedures. Procedures such as the intermittentinfusion of antibiotics often involve an intravenously placed catheter.Procedures such as peritoneal dialysis involve a surgically implantedcatheter. These catheters terminate outside the patient's skin withtube connectors mateable to the disposable administration tubing setof the fluid or drug sources.It is very important to protect and disinfect the reusableconnector on the patient catheter before and after the procedure so asto reduce the possibility of infection. For example, it is important toreduce the risk of peritonitis infection in peritoneal dialysis patients 

 since peritoneal membrane injury may lead to premature termination ofperitoneal dialysis therapy.Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) allows apatient to perform peritoneal dialysis during a near normal dailyroutine. The CAPD patient manually performs 3 to 6 fluid exchangesdaily wherever he may be. However, due to the number of exchanges andthe variety of environments, CAPD has a high peritonitis rate.There are currently a number of connector caps in use for sealingand protecting the catheter connection after disconnecting from thedialysis solution administration set. Many of the caps require the userto apply a separately packaged disinfectant to the cap in order todisinfect the connector of the peritoneal catheter. This procedure istime consuming, messy and prone to accidential spills. Often, thedisinfection is only partially accomplished which increases the chanceof infection. Other connector caps, such as disclosed in theantibacterial protective cap of Genatempo et al., U.S. Patent No.4,440,207 are provided with absorbents containing a disinfectant.However, these absorbents may dry out, may not contain enoughdisinfectant to provide effective disinfection, or do not deliver thedisinfectant to the area of contamination. Also these caps tend to leakwhen being connected.

WE CLAIM:
1. A terminal reservoir device for a connectable tube
connector, comprising:
a hollow member having first and second open ends;
first means for sealing said first open end, said first
sealing means being inwardly displaceable into the hollow member;
second means for sealing said second open end;
an enclosed chamber defined by said hollow member, said
first sealing means and second sealing means; and
means axially extending from said first end of said
hollow member for engaging and advancing the connectable tube
connector toward said chamber so as to inwardly displace the first
sealing means into said chamber.
2. The terminal reservoir device of claim 1 further
including a medical substance contained in said enclosed chamber.
3. The terminal reservoir device of claim 2 wherein
said first sealing means is a first plug member sealingly engageable
in the first open end of the hollow member from the direction of the
second end. 


 4. The terminal reservoir device of claim 3 wherein
said first open end includes a radially inward extending annular
flange defining an orifice and wherein said first plug member
includes a plug portion and a flange portion, said plug portion having
a sealing friction fit in said orifice and said flange portion abutting
said annular flange.
5. The terminal reservoir device of claim 4 wherein
said second sealing means is a member adapted to sealingly close the
second open end after the medical substance is positioned in said
hollow member.
6. The terminal reservoir device of claim 5 wherein
said closing member is a second plug member including a second plug
portion sealingly engageable in the hollow member and a second
flange portion abutting said second open end.
7. The terminal reservoir device of claim .6 wherein
said flange portion of said first plug has a smaller diameter than
said hollow member so that said first plug is sealingly engaged in
said orifice and said chamber is partially filled with said medical
substance before said second plug is sealingly engaged in said second
open end. 


 8. The terminal reservoir device of claim 7 wherein
said engaging and advancing means includes an internally threaded
axial extension.
9. The terminal reservoir device of claim 7 wherein
said engaging and advancing means includes an externally threaded
axial extension.
10. The terminal reservoir device of claim 7 wherein said
medical substance is a disinfectant.
1 1. The terminal reservoir device of claim 10 wherein
said disinfectant is povidone iodine.
12. The terminal reservoir device of claim 2 wherein
said medical substance is a disinfectant.
13. The terminal reservoir device of claim 2 wherein
said medical substance is a therapeutic drug.
14. The terminal reservoir device of claim 2 wherein
said medical substance is a dignostic fluid.
15. The terminal reservoir device of claim 1 wherein
said chamber is an empty reservoir suitable for collecting a fluid
sample.
