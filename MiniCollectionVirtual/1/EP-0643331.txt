<ABSTRACT>
A halftone phase shift photomask having a sufficiently 
high transmittance for light of short wavelength and usable 

for high-resolution lithography effected by exposure using 
deep-ultraviolet + radiation, e.g., 

krypton fluoride excimer laser light. The 
halftone phase shift photomask has on a transparent 

substrate a halftone phase shift layer which includes at 
least one layer composed mainly of a chromium compound. The 

chromium compound contains at least fluorine atoms in 
addition to chromium atoms. A transmittance higher than a 

predetermined level can be obtained even in exposure carried 
out at a relatively short wavelength. The photomask can be 

used for exposure using deep-ultraviolet + radiation, e.g., 

krypton fluoride excimer laser light 
(wavelength: 248 nm). Thus, high-resolution lithography can 

be realized. Since the photomask can be formed by 
approximately the same method as in the case of the 

conventional photomasks, it is possible to improve the yield 
and reduce the cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photomask used for
producing integrated circuits of high integration density,
e.g., large-scale integrated circuits (LSI), very large-scale
integrated circuits (VLSI), etc., and to a photomask
blank used to produce the photomask. The present invention
also relates to a method of producing the photomask blank.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
halftone phase shift photomask whereby a projected image of
very small size can be obtained, and also to a halftone
phase shift photomask blank for producing the halftone phase
shift photomask. Further, the present invention relates to
a method of producing the halftone phase shift photomask
blank.Semiconductor integrated circuits, e.g., IC, LSI, VLSI,
etc., are produced by repeating lithography processes using
photomasks. To form semiconductor integrated circuits of
very small size in particular, use of a phase shift
photomask has heretofore been considered, as disclosed, for
example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI)
No. 58-173744 (1983) and Japanese Patent Application Post-Exam
Publication No. 62-59296 (1987), and phase shift
photomasks having various arrangements have been proposed.
Among them, what is called halftone phase shift photomask
such as is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
(KOKAI) No. 4-136854 (1992), U.S. Patent No. 4,890,309,
etc. has attracted attention from the expectation that it
will soon be put to practical use, and some proposals have
been made with regard to arrangements and materials of the
halftone phase shift photomask, which enable an improvement
in yield and a reduction in cost as a result of a reduction
in the number of manufacturing steps required. For example,
see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 5-2259
(1993) and 5-127361 (1993). From JP-A-63-081426 a photomask blank and a photomask are
known. A photomask blank comprises a light transmittive
substrate and a see-through thin film coated on a principal
surface of the light transmittive substrate. The see-through
thin film contains chromium and nitride, oxide, or fluoride of
chromium. Further, a photomask comprises a light transmittive
substrate consisting of quartz glass and a see-through thin
film pattern formed on a principal surface of the light
transmittive substrate. The see-through thin film pattern is
obtained by patternizing selectively the see-through thin film
of a photomask blank and contains chromium and nitride, oxide,
or fluoride of chromium.JP-A-2-242252 also
