<ABSTRACT>
The material has mutually linked micro- and anisodiametric macropores, the latter being located substantially on its 
periphery. The volume ratio between the macro- and micropores equals 1:3-7. The method provides for freezing the polymer 

dispersion at the temperature providing for the ratio between the dispersed phase and the non-crystallized dispersion 
medium of 3-11:1, and conditioning of the linked dispersed system at the temperature and during the time which are 

sufficient for the conversion of the phases, with its subsequent defreezing. A polymer dispersion is used which contains a 
liquid dispersion medium capable of crystallization and a polymer phase capable of autohesion at temperatures lower than 

the temperature of the melting point of crystals of the dispersion medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous polymer 
material and a process for its production from 
polymer dispersions. Widely known in the prior art are the processes 
for the production of polymer materials involving 
coagulation of polymer dispersions by ionic 
deposition, electrodeposition, drying and thermosensibilization. 
The indispensable prerequisites 
for implementation of these processes include constant 
properties of polymer dispersions, high concentration 
of polymer dispersed phase from 40 to 
60 wt.-%, strict control of temperature and time 
parameters, employment of coagulants. These processes are good mainly for the production 
of polymer films. Control of structure and, 
consequently, physicomechanical properties of such 
materials in the desired direction is hardly attainable 
due to the technological difficulties in 
maintaining said parameters within the necessary 
interval. Known in the prior art is a process for the 
production of a microporous polymer leather-like 
watertight sheet material (US, A, 3.376.158) which 
involves applying an aqueous polymer dispersion-latex 
to a porous flexible fibrous substrate, coagulating 
polymer latex by freezing at minus 100 to 
minus 10째C, and drying the resulting product.  
 The process envisages treatment of polymer latexes 
capable of coalescing within a temperature interval 
from 10 to 100째C and characterized by a secant 
module which is not under 22 Pa at a 5% tension. 
Concentration or the polymer dispersed phase 
ranges from 10 to 75 wt,-%, when a layer or latex 
0.07 to 2.3 mm thick is deposited on the fibrous 
substrate. Before depositing, the latex is thickened 
to 10-40 P with caseinate and ammonium alginate, 
methyl cellulose and sodium polyacrylate. The polymer 
latex is also treated with crosslinking agents, 
accelerators and crosslinking activators, thickeners 
and fibrous additives. All these ingredients, 
particularly in presence of an additional destabilizing 
factor, in this case freezing, tend to create 
an orderly structure and speed up thin process, 
thus forming a microporous polymer structure. It 
should be noted, that this structure is also largely 
defined by the structure of the porous fibrous 
substrate to which latex is applied. In realizing the above process, freezing and 
resulting coagulation form a discrete polymer structure 
on the substrate. Owing to the effect of crosslinking 
agents and the coalescing capacity of the 
used polymers said structure is transformed by drying 
into a thin polymer coating of
