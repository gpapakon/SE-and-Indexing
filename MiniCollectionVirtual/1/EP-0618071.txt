<ABSTRACT>
Device to apply in line a plastic coating to both sides of a 
support, the device being suitable to apply plastic films 

(11-111) continuously to supports (12) of a paper type, to 
woven fabrics, to metal sheets, etc. for the purposes of 

protection, reinforcement and/or surface finish, the support 
(12) being continuous or consisting of sheets and being fed 

along a plane (15) of application of the plastic coating, 
the device comprising calenders (16) which consist of at 

least one first heated chromium-plated steel roll (17) 
polished to a mirror finish and a second unheated rubberised 

roll (18) of a smaller diameter, the device comprising two 
substantially equal calenders (16a-16b) positioned in 

succession on the common and substantially horizontal plane 
(15) of application of the plastic coating to the support 

(12), the calenders (16a-16b) being arranged reciprocally 
rotated substantially by 180° in relation to the common 

plane (15) of application of the plastic coating, so that 
the respective surface of the support (12) affected by 

application of the plastic film (11-111) cooperates with the 
respective chromium-plated steel roll (17) polished to a 

mirror finish.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus to apply and line a plastic coating to both sides of a
support, the device being suitable to apply plastic films continuously to supports of a paper
type, to woven fabrics, to metal sheets, etc. for the purpose of protection, reinforcement
and/or surface finish, the support being continuous or consisting of sheets, and the device
comprising two substantially identical calenders, each consisting of two rolls, one of which
having a smaller diameter and being arranged on the side of the support or the first plastic
film which has been already applied, the two calenders being positioned in succession along
the path of the support.In a device of this type, as described in US-4,096,018, each calender has two heated rolls.
The calenders lie in different planes which are arranged orthogonally to each other. For
enabling a good connection of the plastic films to the support, the support runs through three
loops which are arranged in a drying chamber. After an adhesive has been applied to one
side of the support, it is led through the first loop in the drying chamber. Then, a first plastic
film is applied to one side of the support. This is repeated in a second loop through the drying
chamber for applying the second plastic film in the second calender. For ensuring a good
connection of the plastic films to the support, the laminate has to pass through a third loop in
the drying chamber. This device is rather complicated and needs a plurality of different paths
for applying the plastic films to the support by means of the calenders. The drying chamber is
heated in order to condition the support for connecting the plastic films thereto. It takes a
considerable time until the support is preconditioned and the plastic film can be applied
thereto. The speed of production has to be reduced if a sufficient quality of the product is
desired. EP 0 319 252 A2 describes a device for applying a layer to one side of a support material.
The layer is led through an oven where it is preheated and an adhesive which is applied
thereto is dried. The laminate is combined with a conveyor in a calender consisting of a
heated nip roller and a rubber-surfaced pressure roller. This calender needs the oven for
preheating for applying one laminate to a side of the support.EP 0 488 870 A1 discloses a calender for applying plastic films to each side of a support. The
calender comprises two heated rolls forming a nip to which the two plastic films and the
support are simultaneously fed. Each plastic film

Apparatus to apply in line a plastic coating to both sides of a support, the
device being suitable to apply plastic films (11, 111) continuously to supports

(12) of a paper type, to woven fabrics, to metal sheets, etc. for the purpose of
protection, reinforcement and/or surface finish, the support (12) being

continuous or consisting of sheets, and the device comprising two
substantially identical calenders (16), each consisting of two rolls (17, 18),

one of which having a smaller diameter and being arranged on the side of the
support (12) or the first plastic film which has already been applied, the two

calenders being positioned in succession along the path of the support (12),
characterized in that

each calender (16) consists of at least one first heated chromium-plated steel
roll (17) polished to a mirror finish and arranged on the side of the respective

plastic film to be applied, and of a second unheated rubberized roll (18)
having said smaller diameter, the calenders (16) being positioned in

succession on a substantially horizontal plane (15) for application of the
plastic coating to the support (12), and being arranged reciprocally rotated

substantially by 180° in relation to the common plane (15) of application of the
plastic coating, and the plane in which the calenders (16) lie being arranged

at an angle of around 90° and transverse to the common plane (15) of
application of the plastic coating, the plastic film (11, 111) cooperating with the

respective chromium-plated steel roll (17) over at least 90° of the surface
thereof. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein a station (21) for spreading adhesive
