<ABSTRACT>
An automatic injector/aspirator, a mechanically powered injector, medicine injection cartridges (2431) used therewith, and methods of using same to administer fluid medicaments by injection are disclosed. The injector/aspirator and injector include a chamber for receipt of the prepackaged medicine injection cartridges (2431), a rod (2440) for applying force to drive fluid medicament from the cartridges (2431) through an injection needle (2423) into a subject, and a source (2013) of such driving force. The injector/aspirator includes means for controlling the rate, direction and extent of needle insertion and withdrawal, and injection or aspiration of fluid, means for data storage and programming the injector/aspirator to predetermine and vary rates according to medically relevant factors, and sensors and indicators for monitoring performance. The force to drive a mechanical injector of the invention may be provided by release of a compressed spring (2013) or gas. Locking means (2031 and 2417) are provided for preventing accidental discharge of needles (2423) or medicine from the injectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to injection/aspiration
devices, injection devices, and to
cartridge vials for use with either or both, all for
medical and research purposes and more particularly to
devices designed for injecting medicines and other
fluids into human beings and other subjects using a
hollow injection needle.The injection/aspiration component and some of
the cartridge vial components of the invention are
also configured to aspirate blood and/or other fluids.
A mechanical actuator device of the invention can be
adapted to use with many of the cartridges of the
invention.In the conventional medical procedure for
injecting medicines or for aspirating blood or fluids,
a syringe with a hollow injection/aspiration needle,
such as a standard hypodermic needle, is used. Needles
are repugnant to many patients, particularly those who
must have regular injections of medicine or blood
samples taken. Among these are elderly patients and
people who must have daily injections of insulin or
other drugs. Similarly, pediatric patients are
particularly afraid of needles. Exposed or visible
needles are undesirable because they create fear and
apprehension in many subjects.Another problem in the medical field is that of
the communication of infectious diseases caused by
used needles and syringes and fluids therefrom coming
into contact with doctors, nurses, or other medical
personnel. Needle tips often remain exposed after aspiration of a
fluid or blood from a subject, or after injection of a
medicine into a subject and medical personnel are
sometimes accidentally pricked with such tips. This
problem is particularly acute in situations where a
syringe and needle have been contaminated with
particularly virulent organisms such as the AIDS virus or
the hepatitis virus. The risk of puncture with a
contaminated needle point is of particular concern after
an injection because a finger, hand or other part of the
person administering the injection is typically in close
physical proximity to the needle during its removal from
the subject's tissues, during replacement of a needle or
the needle cover or during removal of the needle from a
syringe for disposal.There is also danger of such exposures to personnel,
such as maintenance people, other than medical personnel,
when a used needle and/or syringe is laid aside or
discarded with a needle tip still exposed. This danger
continues even when a used needle and/or syringe are
placed in a disposal container. For instance, it is a
routine medical procedure to use a device
