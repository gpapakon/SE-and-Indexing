<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dispensing device of the
kind comprising a cylinder, dispensing means (e.g. a piston
device, an extendable membrane or a combination of a piston
and an extendable membrane) movable within the cylinder and
separating the cylinder into a first chamber containing
fluent material and having a discharge outlet and a second
chamber containing an electrolyte, and a galvanic element comprising a sacrificial first
electrode and a gas-releasing second electrode electrically
connected to the first electrode, the first and second
electrodes being of different gavanically active materials,
e.g. metallic or carbon, and which, on activation of the
device, are brought into contact with the electrolyte so as
to electrochemically generate gas within, and increase the
pressure within, said second chamber thereby causing the
dispensing means to move within the cylinder to discharge
said fluent material through the discharge outlet. The
invention primarily relates to lubricant dispensing devices
which are mounted on machinery and dispense lubricant into
lubricating channels of bearings of the machinery at a
steady rate over a prolonged period of time, e.g. from one
to twelve months. However the invention may also find
application in the automatic dispensing over a period of
time of other types of fluent material, such as other
liquids, pastes, gels or even powder material. The
invention also relates to a method of dispensing fluent
material at a controlled rate over a period of time.A known dispensing device of the kind referred to for
dispensing lubricant is described in GB-A-1401535. In this
known device the first and second electrodes are formed as
a bi-polar galvanic element which is initially contained in
a third chamber separated from the second chamber by a
common frangible wall. A separate screw-threaded activating
member is inserted into the third chamber and, on being
turned, pushes the galvanic element against the common
frangible wall fracturing the latter and pushing the
galvanic element into the electrolyte contained in the 
second chamber. The second chamber has flexible,
elastomeric walls and a piston device and, as gas is
electrochemically generated, the second chamber expands
moving the piston device towards the discharge outlet. Such
known dispensing devices are well proven in practice and the
means for activating the device to initiate and preserve the
steady electrochemical generation of gas has been both
accurately predictable and reliable. However there is a
disadvantage
