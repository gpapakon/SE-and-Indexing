<ABSTRACT>
A direct dispensing, surgical suture package 
is disclosed. The package comprises a first 

rectangular panel 1 and a second rectangular panel 2. 
The second panel is foldably connected to a short side 

of the first rectangular panel. The package also 
comprises a first rectangular flap 3 which is foldably 

connected to a long side of the first rectangular 
panel. Further, the package comprises a second 

rectangular flap 4. The second flap is foldably 
connected to a long side of the second rectangular 

panel. The package further comprises means for 
accessing a surgical needle between the second 

rectangular panel and flap. The package is useful for 
dispensing a suture from it without having to open, 

tear or mutilate any of the panels or flaps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surgical suture 
package. The package is self-contained and permits 
direct dispensing of a single-armed or double-armed 
suture, with or without a pledget. The significance of packaging is most evident 
in the packaging of surgical sutures. It is essential 
that the package protect the product and maintain 
sterility throughout its period of potential use. 
Sutures may be stored in hospitals for several years, 
although the usual storage time is much shorter. It is 
also essential that the package provide rapid and 
positive means of identification, and release of the 
undamaged product, ready for use by the surgeon. There are many sizes of sutures, and many 
materials of construction such as catgut or 
polyglycolic acid for absorbables, and silk, cotton, 
nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, 
stainless steel, insulated stainless steel and other 
materials for use as non-absorbables. There are 
several different needle types in common use including 
pointed straight, pointed curved, three cornered 
straight, three cornered curved, curved both regular 
and reverse cutting, and needles with side cutting 
edges of various types. The variations and 
combinations of each of the above, to meet the  
 
preferences of many surgeons for different operative 
procedures, means that the suture manufacturer needs to 
supply different suture package combinations. These 
suture package combinations can run into the thousands. 
The importance of positive identification while 
maintaining an efficient, economical package can thus 
be readily appreciated. It is also important to provide convenience 
to the surgeon and to limit the risk of accidentally 
enclosing foreign items in the patient by limiting the 
number of extraneous packaging materials associated 
with use of the product in the operating theater. A 
count is often kept to ensure that each item is 
accounted for and removed from the operating field. 
Considering the ramifications of accidentally enclosing 
such material in the patient during the surgical 
procedure, is it absolutely essential to minimize this 
hazard. Finally, it is essential in a package 
containing a surgical needle or needles, that the 
suture is protected from contact with the sharp point 
or cutting edge of the needle, which could partially 
cut the suture or the package. Also, the armed needle 
edges and point need to be protected to maintain their 
sharpness. The prior art generally discloses a surgical 
suture or sutures package in a strippable
