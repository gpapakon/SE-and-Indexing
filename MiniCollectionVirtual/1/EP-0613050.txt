<ABSTRACT>
Improved chemically amplified negative tone 
microlithographic resist compositions and methods for the 

use thereof are disclosed. The compositions comprise, in 
admixture, a crosslinking agent, a polymeric binder, and 

a compound that generates acid upon exposure of the 
resist composition to imaging radiation. The invention 

is particularly related to compositions having a 
crosslinking agent which does not plasticize the 

polymeric binder or alternatively does not reduce the 
glass transition temperature thereof. This minimizes the 

diffusion of the acid component from exposed regions of 
the resist to unexposed regions, and helps maintain 

relief image dimensional control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides improved chemically 
amplified negative tone microlithographic resist compositions 
and methods for the use thereof. The compositions 
comprise, in admixture, a crosslinking agent, a polymeric 
binder, and a compound that generates acid upon exposure 
of the resist composition to imaging radiation. The invention 
is particularly related to compositions having a 
crosslinking agent which does not plasticize the polymeric 
binder or alternatively does not reduce the glass transition 
temperature thereof. This minimizes the diffusion of 
the acid component from exposed regions of the resist to 
unexposed regions. Such compositions are especially useful 
in the fabrication of integrated circuit devices by 
microlithographic techniques. In the fabrication of integrated circuits, the exposure 
of a photoresist to radiation is an integral process 
step. The production of high density circuits having sub 
micron dimensions requires that such exposure be accomplished 
within close processing tolerances. For example, 
it is important to control the linewidth of the imaged and 
developed photoresist so that any deviation from the nominal 
design linewidth is small, typically less than ± 10%. The use of acid sensitive resist compositions is well 
known in the art. Such resist compositions are especially 
useful in conjunction with deep UV (180-300 nm) and X-ray 
exposure tools, in light of their high photospeed requirements. 
Although positive working resists are preferred 
for printing contact holes, negative working resists are 
gaining in popularity because of their usefulness in phase 
shift lithographic methods. Negative working resists  
 
provide higher yields in some lithographic applications 
and tend to reduce or eliminate the bias observed when 
printing isolated lines and line and space pairs with the 
same mask. Most negative working compositions depend upon a 
crosslinking agent to react with a polymeric binder to 
form a base-insoluble film comprised of a higher molecular 
weight polymer. An exception is a resist disclosed in 
US-A 4 491 628 which may be processed to form negative 
tone relief images by means of a polarity change in the 
polymer binder which renders exposed regions insoluble in 
organic developer while the unexposed regions dissolve and 
are removed. Organic developers are generally less desirable 
and pose a safety hazard because of flammability or 
toxicity issues. Aqueous developers are preferred in 
manufacturing. Thus, aqueous developable resist
