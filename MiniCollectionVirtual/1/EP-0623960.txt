<ABSTRACT>
An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is disclosed, the collector region (7) and source region (8) of which can be produced by means of a self-aligning process. This produces an IGBT which is distinguished by a homogeneous switch-off current distribution. For this purpose, the width W of the source region (8) is chosen to be small enough for holes coming from the anode which flow through the collector region (7) to the cathode contact to flow laterally around the source region. In this case, it must be ensured that the voltage drop across the PN junction of the source region and collector region always remains less than the inherent threshold voltage. The IGBT according to the invention is therefore particularly insensitive to latch-up.
