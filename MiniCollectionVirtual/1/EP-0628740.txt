<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composite material
having two layer compositions of different materials and
to the manufacturing method of said composite material.
More specifically, this invention relates to said type of
composite material suitable for lubricationless bearings
of comparatively small diameter having fluorine resin
applied on the inner surface of metallic members, and to
the manufacturing method thereof.In general, lubricationless bearings called Dry
Bearings using no lubricant are often used in the rotating
and sliding parts of smaller apparatusses such a
cassettetape recorder, videotape recorder and the like
due to no pollution by lubricant and simple structure of
this type of bearings. Particularly, the lubricationless
bearings using any suitable bearing material such as fluorine
resin on the rotating or sliding parts thereof are most
preferred due to the low friction coefficient of the used
bearing material.Fig.9 is a longitudinal cross-section view of such a
lubricationless bearing 1 used generally. This
lubricationless bearing 1 comprises a cylinder of material
2 which is made from a rod or pipe of fluorine resin 
having a low friction coefficient, for example
polytetrafluoroethylene(referred to as PTFE hereinbelow)
by cutting into determined size and shape. However, this
type of lubricationless bearing 1 has to have a
comparatively larger wall thickness owing to the low
mechanical strength of its material 2 of PTFE resin, for
example a wall thickness of 1.5mm or more for its internal
diameter of 3 mm. Accordingly, a lubricationless bearing
1 having higher diameter needs to use a higher quantity of
high-price PTFE with higher cost. Since the wall thickness
of PTFE resin is higher, the deformation of resin for
applied loads becomes larger when the resin is used at a
high PV value. Further, heat generated due to the relative
movement between said PTFE resin and rotating shaft not
shown is accumulated within said resin to cause a
considerable heat expansion, so that the clearance between
said resin and said shaft has to be larger.Further, said heat generated by relative movement
between the lubricationless bearing 1 and the shaft causes
softening of the resin and the increase of abrasion
thereof thereby to shorten the life thereof.For the purpose of eliminating the above described
disadvantages, lubricationless bearings 4 are used
nowadays which are produced from composite material 3 as
shown in Fig.10. The composite material 3 comprises a flat
steel plate 5 covered by a sheet of
