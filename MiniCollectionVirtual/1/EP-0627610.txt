<ABSTRACT>
A two-stage detection noncontact positioning apparatus comprises a light 
position-detecting mechanism 3 which includes a first light position 

detector 15 having a slit 17 at a central location corresponding to an 
optical axis K₄, and a light position detector 16 for receiving a measuring 

beam S₉ having passed through the slit 17. The first light position 
detector 15 can be switchably operated such that while the second light 

position detector 16 receives the measuring beam, the first light position 
detector 15 is made inoperative not to detect light. The apparatus also 

includes an optical mechanism 2 having focusing lenses 13 and 14 provided in 
a manner corresponding to the first and second light position detectors 15 

and 16, respectively. As the measuring beam, a semiconductor laser beam, a 
He-Ne laser beam or the like is suitably employed, which enables the two-stage 

detection noncontact positioning apparatus to perform highly accurate 
positioning without being adversely affected by scattered lights.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a two-stage detection noncontact positioning 
apparatus which is capable of focusing on a surface of an object in a 
noncontacting and highly accurate manner. It is a technically very difficult problem to achieve optical focusing in a 
noncontacting manner upon objects of various size, shape, and physical 
properties. As a focusing technique generally practiced heretofore, there 
is an image processing technique using a computer. Such an image processing technique, however, has difficulties in that it 
requires a large-scale apparatus, and is slow in performing focusing 
operations because of image scanning to be executed therein, with 
insufficient reliability due to susceptibility to influence of luminance 
distribution. To overcome these difficulties, the present inventor previously proposed a 
noncontact positioning apparatus (Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 
(Kokai) No. 62-75411 corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,843,228 and EP 
Publication No. 0273 717 B1) which utilizes a laser beam. The proposed 
noncontact positioning apparatus comprises a laser beam-emitting mechanism 
for emitting a laser beam as a measuring beam, an optical mechanism having  
 
mirror means for reflecting the measuring beam in a direction parallel to an 
optical axis, an objective lens for refracting the measuring beam toward an 
object and for refracting again the measuring beam reflected from the object, 
and a focusing lens for causing the measuring beam reflected from the object 
and refracted by the objective lens to focus on a position located on the 
optical axis, a light position-detecting mechanism of a split-in-two type 
for receiving the measuring beam passed through the focusing lens to deliver 
a position signal, and a focusing mechanism responsive to the position signal 
from the light position-detecting mechanism for moving at least one of the 
object and the objective lens to thereby automatically focus the measuring 
beam on a surface of the object. In WO-A-8801367 the problem of extraneous light is solved by the inclusion 
in the arrangement of a beam splitter and an additional photodetector. This allows 
the extraneous light to be isolated (on photodiodes 34) and its effect to be measured and appropriately subtracted. It is an object of the invention to further improve the aforementioned 
positioning apparatus proposed by the present inventor, thereby providing an 
positioning apparatus which is capable of focusing with even higher accuracy 
by making the apparatus
