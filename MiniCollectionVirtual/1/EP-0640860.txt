<ABSTRACT>
In a waveguide-type optical device, two optical waveguides (2a,2b) 
are formed in a substrate (1) of LiNbO₃ or LiTaO₃. On the 

substrate and the two waveguides, a blocking layer (7) is formed to 
block a diffusion of Li ions from the substrate. On the blocking 

layer, a buffer layer (3) made from SiO₂ is formed. Each of electrodes 
(4a,4b) from which operation voltages are supplied covers each coupling 

part of the two optical waveguides, respectively via the blocking 
layer (7) and the buffer layer (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a waveguide-type optical device
which performs amplitude modulation of an optical signal and
switching of optical paths, and more particularly to a waveguide-type
optical switch formed on a LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 substrate having
an electro-optical effect.A conventional waveguide-type optical switch fabricated
on a LiNbO3 crystal substrate has the characteristic of low light
absorption and low loss and high efficiency due to its high electro-optical
effect.The conventional waveguide-type optical switch is
disclosed, for example, in Shoji Yamada et al., "DC Drift Phenomena
in LiNbO3 Optical Waveguide Devices", Japanese Journal of
Applied Physics, Vol. 20, No. 4, April 1981, pp. 733-737.Referring to Figs. 1A and 1B, the conventional waveguide-type
optical switch is described. Fig. 1A is a perspective view
of the structure of the conventional waveguide-type optical switch
and Fig. 1 B is a sectional view of the structure.In the optical switch of Figs. 1A and 1 B, a buffer layer 3
is formed on a LiNbO3 substrate 1 which includes two Ti-diffused
optical waveguides 2a and 2b. Electrodes 4a and 4b of a metallic 
material are formed on a coupling portion 5 of each of the optical
waveguides 2a and 2b via the buffer layer 3, respectively.The buffer layer 3 prevents light propagating along the
optical waveguides 2a and 2b from being absorbed by the electrodes
4a and 4b, etc. SiO2 is used as the buffer layer 3 because
its refraction index is 1.45, which is smaller than the refraction
index of about 2.2 of an LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 substrate and because
SiO2 shows little light absorption. When the refraction index is
small, it is more feasible to reduce the thickness of the buffer layer
3 in order to prevent the absorption of light when using SiO2 than
in the case of a material having a larger refraction index.When switching voltages are applied to the electrodes 4a
and 4b, an external electric field concentrates on the buffer layer 3
because the dielectric constant of the buffer layer is smaller than
that of the substrate. Therefore, the electric field in the substrate is
relatively small. The magnitude of the switching voltages needed
for the switching and the modulation becomes higher for larger
thickness of the buffer layer 3.Since SiO2 has a small refraction index and extremely
small absorption of light, there is no other material for the buffer
layer 3 which is superior to SiO2.However, when SiO2 is used as the buffer layer 3 and a
DC voltage is applied between electrodes 4a and 4b, Li ions which
