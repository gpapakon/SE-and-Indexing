<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved method for scan­
ning for flaws on a surface (5) utilizing a novel dynamic 

averaging signal correction technique. Each individual scan 
signal is divided into a large number of samples, each sam­

ple representing a predetermined position in the scan. A 
dynamic average is computed for each of the scan positions 

by averaging samples from the same position of a predeter­
mined number of previously derived scan signals. Each 

time a new scan line is scanned and divided into samples, 
each sample is compared with its corresponding dynamic 

average to provide a signal indicative of surface condition. 
This technique is especially useful to detect flaws on high 

quality tubing, such as used for nuclear reactor fuel rods 
or for nuclear reactor steam generator tubing.
