<ABSTRACT>
A fluid coupling device (4) for coupling an in-line blood sampling unit (2) to a blood sampling container (6) includes a housing (40) having an anterior section formed with an open end capable of being applied to the blood sampling unit (2), a posterior section formed with an open end capable of receiving the blood collecting container (6), and a needle (51) extending axially of the housing. Both sections of the needle terminate sufficiently short of the respective ends of the housing such as to be protected against accidentally puncturing a user's skin. The housing is attached to the blood sampling unit with the anterior section of the needle penetrating the blood sampling unit perpendicularly to the flow of blood therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blood sampling system according to the
preamble of claim 1.One known technique for drawing samples of blood
uses a double-ended needle, one end of which is to be
inserted into the subject's blood vessel, and the opposite
end of which is to be coupled to a blood collecting
container under vacuum such as to draw the blood into the
container. Examples of this type of device are described in
European Patent EP-A-0 428 723 and US Patents
3,877,465 and 4,934,012.It is also known to draw a sample of blood via an
in-line blood sampling unit already in place for another
purpose. For example, where a blood collecting assembly is
already connected to a subject donating blood, it may be
desirable to extract a sample of the blood for diagnostic or
testing purposes. This may be done by providing the blood
collecting assembly with an in-line blood sampling unit, as
described, for example, in US Patents 4,763,648, 4,920,970
and 4,981,140.From WO A-91 00115 a fluid transfer system is known comprising a channel
member. On both ends of the channel member a part of a duct is introduced so that the
flow channel comprises a duct, a channel member having a slightly different outer
diameter and again a second part of the duct having a slightly smaller diameter.According to the present invention there is provided a blood sampling system
having the characterising feaures of claim 1. According to further features in the described
preferred embodiment, the attaching means comprises a pair
of bayonet-type slots formed in the opposite sides of the
housing anterior section, each slot having an axially-extending
portion starting from the open end of the housing
anterior section and terminating in a circumferentially-extending
portion inwardly of the open end.Further features and advantages of the invention
will be apparent from the description below. The invention is herein described, by way of
example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings,
wherein:
Fig. 1 illustrates a blood sampling system
including one form of fluid coupling device not within the range of the claims;Fig. 2 is a three-dimensional view, partly broken
away to show internal structure, of the fluid coupling
device illustrated in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 illustrates the attachment of the fluid
coupling device of Fig. 2 to the in-line blood sampling unit
of the blood collecting assembly of Fig. 1;Fig. 4 is a view similar to that of Fig. 2 but
illustrating another form of fluid coupling device
not within the range of the claims; andFig.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A blood sampling system including a fluid coupling device (4) and an in-line blood
sampling unit, wherein said fluid coupling device (4) is arranged for coupling said in-line blood

sampling unit (116) of a blood collecting assembly (2) to a blood sampling container (6), said
fluid coupling device comprising: a housing (40) having an anterior section (41) formed with an

open end capable of being applied to the blood sampling unit, a posterior section (42) integral
with said anterior section and formed with an open end capable of receiving the blood sampling

container, and a transversely-extending member (43) between said anterior and posterior
sections; a needle (50) secured to said transversely-extending member so as to extend axially of

said housing; said needle having anterior (51) and posterior (52) sections extending within said

anterior and posterior sections of the housing, respectively; both the anterior and posterior
sections of the needle terminating sufficiently short of the open ends of the anterior and posterior

sections of the housing such as to be protected against accidentally puncturing a user's skin; and
attaching means (54) for attaching said housing to the blood sampling unit with the anterior

section of the needle penetrating the blood sampling unit perpendicularly to the flow of blood
there through said blood sampling unit (116), comprising a further housing (118) having two ports (124),

one in an anterior section thereof and one in a posterior section thereof and a tube (112) threaded
through said ports, 
characterised in that
 said tube (112) is threaded through said further housing (118),
such that a portion of said tube extends continuously between said two ports

and a plug (126) closing said housing and aligned with the
portion of the tube located within the further housing and wherein

said section of said tubing is penetrated by the anterior section (51a) of the needle when
penetrating the blood sampling unit. 
System according to Claim 1, wherein said
attaching means (54) comprises a pair of bayonet-type slots

formed in the opposite sides of the housing anterior
section (41), each slot having an axially-extending portion (54a)

starting from the open end of said housing anterior section 
and terminating in a circumferentially-extending portion (54b)

inwardly of said open end.
System according to either of Claims 1 or
2, wherein said transversely-extending member (43) is a

transverse wall dividing the interior of the said housing (40) into
said anterior and posterior sections (41, 42).
System according to any one of Claims 1-3,
wherein said housing is of cylindrical configuration.
System according to Claim 3, wherein the
anterior section of the said housing (40) is of larger diameter than

the posterior section of the said housing (40).
System according to any one of Claims 1-5,
wherein said posterior section (52) of the needle (50) has a sharpened

tip (52a) and is covered by a protective sheath (53) which is
penetrated by said sharpened tip when the fluid coupling

device receives the blood sampling container.
System according to any one of Claims 1-6,
wherein the anterior section (51) of the needle (50) also has a

sharpened tip (51a) to penetrate the said plug (126) of the in-line blood
sampling unit (116) when attached thereto.
System according to any one of Claims 1-7,
wherein the plug is pre-slitted and wherein the anterior section of the needle has a blunt tip (151a)

to penetrate this pre-slitted plug of the in-line blood
sampling unit when attached thereto.
