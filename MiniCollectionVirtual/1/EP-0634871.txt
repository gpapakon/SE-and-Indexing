<ABSTRACT>
High-resolution, progressive format video signals (on C3100) 
having high frame rates may be encoded by a base layer encoder 

(C3140) and an enhancement layer encoder (C3180) to provide two 
kinds of encoded video signals which share a common output channel 

(C3260). These encoded video signals are received at an input 
(C3270) of a video receiver which may use one or both of the two 

kinds of encoded video signal. Relatively lower performance 
high-definition televisions may thus receive video signals from 

higher performance transmitters and produce satisfactory pictures. 
Higher performance HDTVs will be able to utilize the full 

performance capabilities of these video signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to encoding and decoding of 
video signals. More particularly, this invention relates to 
multi-level encoding and decoding of high-resolution video 
signals, such as high-definition television (HDTV) signals. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now has 
before it several different proposals regarding 
standardization of high-definition television (HDTV) 
systems. These proposals envision a short-term solution to 
the problem of standardization involving both interlaced 
format video and reduced resolution progressively scanned 
video. For example, these proposals involve interlaced 
format video comprising a full 1,050 horizontal lines of 
picture elements (pels) per frame (960 active lines), 
progressive format video comprising 787.5 horizontal lines 
of pels per frame (720 active lines) at frame rates of 60 
Hz, 30 Hz, or 24 Hz, and progressive format video comprising 
1,050 horizontal lines of pels per frame (960 active lines) 
at a frame rate of 30 Hz or 24 Hz. At some unspecified time 
in the future, HDTV standards are expected to migrate to a 
full resolution progressively scanned format. For example,  
 
it is expected that HDTV standards may evolve to a 
progressive format video comprising a full 1,050 horizontal 
lines of pels at a full 60 Hz frame rate. In the meantime, 
it is expected that a large amount of expensive, relatively 
low capability HDTV equipment will be made and sold which 
will use the early low-capability standards. It will be 
necessary for any high-capability future HDTV standards to 
permit reception of reasonable pictures on these earlier 
low-capability systems. During the transition period from the short-term 
systems to the later higher performance implementations, it 
will be necessary for older HDTV sets to receive the new 
signals and display reasonably good-looking pictures from 
those signals. An advantageous way to provide for this 
capability is through a technique of scalable coding of high 
resolution progressive format video signals whereby a base 
layer of coding and an enhancement layer of coding are 
combined to form a new encoded video signal. Older HDTVs 
will discard the enhancement layer and derive their pictures 
only from the base layer, which is made compatible with the 
initial short-term FCC standards. Newer HDTVs will be able 
to utilize both of the base layer and the enhancement layer 
to derive high-resolution, high-frame rate, and progressive 
format pictures.  In a specific example of this invention, a
