<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of feeding 
female birds with a feed formulation which enhances the hatchability 

of the eggs laid, as evidenced by an increase in hatching 
percentage. Poultry diets of this invention include an amount of 

a carnitine, such as L-carnitine or a L-carnitine salt. The 
amount present in the diet is such that the hatchability of eggs 

laid by hens fed this diet is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the general field of poultry
farming and relates to the feeding of fowl, including layers
and broiler breeders. In a particular aspect, it relates to a
method of feeding female birds with a feed formulation which
enhances the hatchability of the eggs laid, as evidenced by an
increase in hatching percentage. Poultry diets
used in the method
of this invention
include an amount of a carnitine, such as L-carnitine or
a L-carnitine salt. The amount present in the diet is such
that the hatchability of eggs laid by hens fed this diet is
increased.JP-1247046 (Patent Abstr. of Japan, Vol. 13, no. 589) describes
a feed for chicken which is capable of suppressing the
excessive accumulation of intraperitoneal fat or outbreak of
fatty liver and is obtained by incorporating a conventional
feed for chicken with 5-2,000 ppm (preferably 20-1,000 ppm) of
L-carnitine.DD-A-291 697 relates to a method of preparing a feed formulation
for agriculturally productive livestock, preferably pigs
and poultry, which involves the intermixing of nutrients and
roughage with additives of various kinds containing as essential
nutritive components a biomass formed by the microbiological
metabolism of substrates, said biomass having a content
of odd-numbered fatty acids and other fatty acids, said method
comprising the admixing to an animal feed composition, already
prepared or to be prepared, carnitine or carnitine-analogous
active substances or precursors thereof in such a way that the
feed formulation contains the carnitine or carnitine-analogous
active substances or their precursors in an amount of between
0.001 and 10 g/kg of dry matter, said carnitine or carnitine-analogous
active substance or their precursors being added, if
necessary, in an encased, encapsulated or otherwise protected
form or that the feed formulation contains as essential components
substances that are decisive for maintaining the required
carnitine potential in the animal organism, preferably 
lysine, methionine and, if necessary, vitamin C, vitamin B6,
iron(II) ions as well as nicotinic acid amide. The required
concentration of L-carnitine in the feed formulation is preferably
achieved by adding L(-)carnitine or DL-carnitine or
gamma butyrobetaine or croton betaine or O-acylcarnitines,
which may be prepared biotechnologically or chemosynthetically,
or by adding dried blood plasma of slaughter cattle,
ultrafiltration permeate of such dried blood plasma, crushed
and dried muscle tissue of productive livestock, carnitine-containing
biomas
