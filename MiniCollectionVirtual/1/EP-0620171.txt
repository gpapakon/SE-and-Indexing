<ABSTRACT>
In order to permit sorting, sheets, especially panes of glass (4), are fed to an erecting machine (6), in which a pane (4) of glass can in each case be placed upright against a wall (18), in front of which the pane of glass is held tight in a certain position by means of a stream of air fed by a fan (22). A pane of glass is respectively drawn from this position by means of displaceable tongs (7) into a sorting carriage (8). The sorting carriage (8) is then moved in front of a fan carriage (10) and the panes of glass situated in the sorting carriage (8) are ejected from the sorting carriage (8) by means of the tongs (7) and inserted into the corresponding compartment of a fan carriage (10). The apparatus is of simple design, operates in an especially rational manner and handles the pane of glass as gently as possible.

<CLAIMS>
An installation for the sorting of plate material, 
in particular glass plates (4), comprising at least one 

compartment carriage (10) for containing and transporting 
plates (4), and a sorting carriage (8) having several 

compartments for the controlled insertion of plates 
into determined compartments of said compartment carriage, 

conveyor means (7) being provided for the purpose 
of introducing plates into said sorting carriage and 

from the latter to said compartment carriage (10), characterised 
in that each compartment of said sorting carriage 

(8) has an associated conveyor device (7) which is 
capable of being extended in order to effect both the 

insertion of plates (4) into said sorting carriage (8) 
and the transfer of plates from said sorting carriage to 

said compartment carriage (10). 
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said conveyor device comprises a pair of displaceable 

nippers (25, 26) for seizing the edge of a plate 
(4). 
Installation according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that the path of the conveyor device 

(7) is program controllable in such a manner that plates 
(4) are transported according to their dimensions in the 

transport direction. 
Installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
comprising a raising device (6) for the purpose of 

uprighting the plates (4) for their takeover by said 
conveyor device (7), characterised in that means (21 - 

23) are provided for producing an air flow between a 
wall (18) and a plate (4) uprighted against said wall,  

 
said air flow holding said plate in a determined distance 

from said wall (18).
