<ABSTRACT>
The bottle (1) comprises a body (5) closed by a capsule (8). 
Within the capsule (8) there is a separator element (9) which 
closes its concavity to prevent mixing of the substances contained 

in the capsule (8) and in the body (5) respectively. To mix the 
substances the separator element (9) is removed by deforming the 

capsule (8). 
To prevent the bottle (1) being able to be opened without mixing 
of the substances having taken place, the outer surface (15) of 

the capsule (8) and the inner surface (6) of the container mouth 
(4) carry respectively an annular projection (14) and an undercut 

ledge (7) which mutually engage only by the effect of the radial 
expansion of the capsule (8) when the separator (9) is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bottle for containing substances in a
separated condition.Bottles in accordance with the classifying part of claim one are
known from DE-A-4238819.Such bottles were invented mainly to increase the preservation
time of compounds which if bottled ready for use would have been
chemically very unstable. Such containers are commonly used in
the pharmaceutical field to maintain a solute in powder or granule
form separate from a liquid solvent.It happens however that persons lacking in experience remove the
capsule and ignore its contents. This happens mainly if the
solute is contained in a particularly small quantity such as to be
practically invisible from the outside of the capsule even if this
is of a transparent plastics material. It is apparent that in
such cases the administration of the medicine has only a
psychological effect and hence hardly therapeutic.The object of the present invention is to obviate the aforesaid
drawback, which occurs with a greater frequency than might be
thought, by providing a bottle which enables a solute to be 
preserved separated from a solvent while at the same time making
it impossible to administer one without the other.This object is attained by a container in accordance with claim
one, herein rewritten for the sake of brevity.In this container it is not possible to remove the closure element
and hence open it if the separator element has not been previously
removed from the interior of the capsule. This ensures that the
solute and solvent meet by gravity before the container is opened.The invention is illustrated by way of non-limiting example in the
figures of the accompanying drawings.
Figure 1 is a partly sectional view showing a bottle according to
the invention undergoing closure by the relative device;Figure 2 is a partly sectional view showing the bottle closed;Figure 3 is a partly sectional view showing the bottle during the
removal of the stopper portion from the interior of the capsule;Figure 4 is an enlarged detail of the bottle closure element.With reference to the aforesaid figures, the bottle according to
the invention, indicated overall by 1, is formed from a container
2 and a closure element 3. The container 2 and the closure
element 3 are both preferably of plastics material, but of
different characteristics. Specifically, the container 2 is of
substantially rigid material whereas the closure element 3 is of
substantially flexible material. The container 2 comprises a
mouth 4 and a container body 5. The mouth 4 is provided

<CLAIMS>
A bottle (1) for preserving in a separated condition
substances to be mined together before dispensing, comprising

a closure element (3) and a container (2),
whereby said closure element (3) is applicable to the

mouth (4) of said container (2), said closure element
(3) comprising a capsule (8) of deformable material and

a separator element (9) which closes the concavity of
said capsule (8) by means of a stopper portion (16) arranged

to engage the inner surface (13) of said capsule
(8), said closure element (3) being applicable to said

mouth (4) such that said stopper portion (16) faces the
interior of said container (2), the outer surface (15)

of the capsule (8) and the inner surface (6) of the
mouth (4) of the container (2) are intended to mutually

engage and carry mutual locking means which comprise at
least one projection (14) arranged to cooperate with at

least one undercut (7) as the stopper portion (16) is
inserted into the capsule (8), said closure element (3)

includes means (17) by which said stopper portion (16)
can be disengaged from said inner surface (13) of said

capsule (8) when said closure element (3) is arranged in
the mouth (4) of said container, 
characterized in that
,
the elasticity of the capsule (8) causes radial contraction

of the end portion of said capsule (8) when said
stopper portion (16) is disengaged from said inner surface

(13) of said capsule (8) whereby the locking means
on the outer surface (15) of the capsule (8) disengages

the locking means on the inner surface (6) of the mouth
(4) of the container (2). 
A bottle as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
projection (14) is provided on the outer surface (15) of the

capsule (8), the undercut (7) Being provided on the inner surface
(6) of the mouth (4) of the container (2).
A bottle as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the outer projection (14) is annular.
A bottle as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the separator element (9) is formed from a stopper portion (16), a

stem (17) and a stop disc (18) positioned on said stem (17) and
arranged to engage at least one projection (11-12) provided on the

inner surface (13) of the capsule (8), to prevent the separator
element (9) from falling into the container (2) on mixing. 
A bottle as claimed in one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised by comprising a security seal (10).
A bottle as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the
security seal (10) comprises a tubular element (19) of circular

cross-section fixed to the capsule (8) by predetermined breakage
strips (20) and extending to cover the point of engagement of the

capsule (8) with the container (2).
A bottle as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the
strips (20) are positioned at the upper end of the flange (23),

said flange (23) being relatively rigid and having its lateral
surface shaped with steps having a decreasing diameter in the

downward direction.
