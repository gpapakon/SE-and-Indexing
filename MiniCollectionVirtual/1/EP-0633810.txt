<ABSTRACT>
Components, usually but not exclusively gaseous components, are removed in a liquid medium from gas streams and chemically converted into an insoluble phase or physically removed. Specifically, hydrogen sulfide may be removed from gas streams by oxidation in aqueous chelated transition metal solution in a modified agitated flotation cell. The same principle may be employed with other procedures in which a gaseous phase is dispersed in a liquid phase to effect an interaction between components present in such phases, for example, to treat or strip or react a component of the liquid phase. A gas-liquid contact apparatus, which may be a combined chemical reactor and solid product separation device, also is described. In order to effect efficient mass transfer and rapid reaction, gas bubbles containing hydrogen sulfide and oxygen are formed by rotating an impeller at a blade tip velocity of at least about 350 in/sec. to achieve the required shear. To assist in the reaction, a surrounding shroud has a plurality of openings, generally of aspect ratio of approximately 1, of equal diameter and arranged in uniform pattern, such as to provide a gas flow therethrough less than about 0.02 1b/min/opening in the shroud. In general, the gas velocity index of gas through the openings in the shroud is at least about 18 per second per opening, preferably at least about 24 per second per opening. Each of the openings has an area correspoding to an equivalent diameter less than about one inch.

 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EFFECTING GAS-LIQUID CONTACTFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to method and apparatus for effecting gas-liquid contacting, for example, for the removal of components from gas streams, in particular by chemical conversion or removal of gaseous components while in contact with a liquid phase or slurry, or for the removal of components from a liquid phase, in particular, for the chemical conversion or removal of components from a liquid phase while in contact with the gaseous phase. REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 863,720 filed April 3, 1992, which itself is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 622,485 filed December 5, 1990 (now U.S. Patent No. 5,174,973) which itself is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application Serial No. 582,423 filed September 14, 1990 (now abandoned) which itself is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 446,776 filed December 6, 1989 (now abandoned) .BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Procedures for effecting contact between a gas phase and a liquid phase have been devised for a variety of purposes, for example, to remove a component from the gas or liquid phase. In this regard, many gas streams contain components which are undesirable and which need to be removed from the gas stream prior to its discharge to the atmosphere or to further processing. One such gaseous component is hydrogen sulfide, while another such component is sulfur dioxide.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 Hydrogen sulfide occurs in varying quantities in many gas streams, for example, in sour natural gas streams and in tail gas streams from various industrial operations. Hydrogen sulfide is odiferous, highly toxic and a catalyst poison for many reactions and hence it is desirable and often necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide from such gas streams.There exist several commercial processes for effecting hydrogen sulfide removal. These include processes, such as absorption in solvents, in which the hydrogen sulfide first is removed as such and then converted into elemental sulfur in a second distinct step, such as in a Claus plant. Such commercial processes also include liquid phase oxidation processes, such as Stretford, LO-CAT, Unisulf, SulFerox, Hiperion and others, whereby the hydrogen sulfide removal and conversion to elemental sulfur normally are effected in reaction and regeneration steps.In Canadian Patent No. 1,212,819 and its corresponding United States
