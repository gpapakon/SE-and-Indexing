<ABSTRACT>
A differential apparatus comprises: a casing (1) 
rotated by an external power; a first shaft (9) rotatably 

supported by the casing; a second shaft (11) rotatably 
supported by the casing; a first side gear (17) formed 

integral with the first shaft; a second side gear (19) 
formed integral with the second shaft; and a helical pinion 

gear assembly (29,31) geared between the first and second 
side gears within the casing filled with a viscous fluid. 

Therefore, a differential limiting force can be generated 
by gearing between the helical pinion gear assembly and the 

first and second side gears, when the viscous fluid is 
pressurized and circulated within the casing by a gear 

pumping action of the helical pinion gear assembly caused 
by differential motion between the first and second side 

gears, even if the torque applied to one of the side gear 
is zero (as when one tire is floated perfectly from a road 

surface). The differential apparatus is provided with the 
differential limiting characteristics of both the torque 

sensitive type and the rotation difference type, in spite 
of a simple structure and a low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a differential apparatus according to the preamble of
claim 1 suitable for use with an automotive vehicle, for instance.Such a differential apparatus is known from US-A-5169370. Said differential
apparatus has helical gears and generates a limiting force if said helical gears are in
pressure contact.When a vehicle runs on a muddy road and thereby one
of the vehicle wheels is being slipped, it is impossible to
transmit a sufficient driving power to the other (non-slipping
side) of the vehicle wheels. To overcome this
problem, the differential apparatus used for automotive
vehicles is usually provided with a differential limiting
mechanism for limiting the differential motion thereof.The above-mentioned differential limiting mechanism
can be roughly classified into torque-proportional type (as
disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined (Kokai) Patent
Application No. 64-87940) and rotation difference sensitive
type (as disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined (Kokai)
Patent Application No. 2-197426).Fig. 1A shows the above-mentioned differential
apparatus having a torque-proportional type differential
limiting mechanism. In the drawing, the differential
apparatus is composed of a rotatable differential casing
131 driven by an engine power; first and second output
shafts 133 and 135 both rotatably supported by the
differential casing 131; first and second side gears 137
and 139 formed integral with the outer circumferences of
the first and second output shafts 133 and 135,
respectively so as to be rotatable within the differential
casing 131; worm wheels 145 and 147 rotatably supported by
the differential casing 131 via shafts 141 and 143 and 
geared with the first and second side gears 137 and 139,
respectively; and spur gears 149 and 151 geared with the worm
wheels 145 and 147, respectively.In the above-mentioned construction, when one
vehicle wheel is slipped, an engine power can be
transmitted to the non-slipping vehicle wheel on the basis
of the friction and thrust forces generated between the
worm wheels 145 and 147 and the first and second side gears
137 and 139, respectively. In the above-mentioned torque-proportional
type differential limiting mechanism, as shown
in Fig. 2A, a differential limiting force can be generated
in a region C enclosed by the two lines A and B (where TL
denotes the left side vehicle wheel torque and TR denotes
the right side vehicle wheel torque), so that it is
Dossible to obtain an excellent steering stability.In the torque-proportional
