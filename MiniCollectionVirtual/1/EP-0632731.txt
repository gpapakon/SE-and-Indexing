<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collapsible and
expandable fluid collection container. Such a container,
corresponding to the pre-characterising part of claim 1,
below, is disclosed in EP-A-92313.Various autotransfusion containers which operate under a
vacuum to collect blood from a patient during surgery also
may be used to reinfuse the collected blood into the
patient. Prior art containers traditionally were formed from
non-collapsible glass blood collection bottles. The art then
evolved to pliable plastic collection bags which, when
compressed, would increase the reinfusion flow of the
collected liquids.To prevent the vacuum from collapsing the container, the
pliable prior art containers are distended mechanically
during the collection procedure. The following patents are
representative of such prior art devices. U.S. Patent No.
4,443,220 discloses the expanding of a cylindrical blood
collection bag by engaging a plurality of sleeve-like loops
annularly spaced about the collection bag with the elongated
tines of a stent. U.S. Patent No. 4,838,872 discloses a
collapsible blood collection bag which is distended by
compressing stiffener members connected to the bag. U.S.
Patent No. 4,943,288 discloses a reinfusion bag which is
maintained in an open configuration by separating frame
members attached to the bag with a pair of crossed-locking
arms which extend across the top and bottom of the reinfusion
bag. US Patent No. 5,011,470 discloses an autotransfusion
unit with a bag to the outside of which is bonded a
plurality of rectangular panels. The panels are spread
in a cylindrical configuration by spreader frames, one at
each end of the cylinder.The prior art also discloses non-mechanical means for
holding the collection bag in an open or expanded 
configuration during the vacuum influenced fluid collection
procedure. U.S. Patent No. 3,866,608 discloses the
application of a second vacuum between the surface of the
collection bag and a rigid outer container to prevent
container collapse. U.S. Patent No. 4,781,707 discloses a
hermetically sealed chamber between a flexible collection bag
and an outer container which prevents the collection bag from
collapsing during the blood collection process.These prior art devices have certain disadvantages. The
portions of the plastic collection bags which are not
directly attached to the mechanical support structure tend to
partially collapse when the vacuum is applied to the
container interior. Consequently, the volume scale provided
on these plastic containers

<CLAIMS>
A fluid collection container (10), comprising:

a collection bag having a variable volume interior
which extends between a first bag end and a second bag end

and which can assume a collapsed disposition and a
distended disposition;
at least two spaced apart stent-engaging members (18)
attached to and spaced about said collection bag, each

extending lengthwise on the bag, with opposed long edges
extending between the first bag end and the second bag end;
a rigid stent (16) releasably engageable to said
spaced stent-engaging members to maintain said collection

bag in a distended disposition;
said collapsible collection bag including a first port
(20) in communication with said variable volume interior

and having a proximal end which is connectable to a source
of suction, and a second port (22) in communication with

said variable volume interior and having a proximal end
which is connectable to a tube for conducting the fluid to

be collected 
characterised in that
:

i) said collection bag includes a non-collapsible,
rigid front wall (12) and a flexible rear wall

(14) which is collapsible and distendible relative to said
non-collapsible, rigid front wall (12), with the stent-engaging

members (18) being rigid, flat and located on the
outside of the rear wall (14);
ii) the rigid stent (16) extends along the length
of the bag and across the space between the or each

adjacent pair of stent-engaging members (18), the long
edges of the respective stent-engaging member which define

each side of the said space being provided with an elongate
stent-receiving space (110) and the stent (16) being

slidably received within said elongate stent-receiving 
space (110), thereby providing structural support between

adjacent stent-engaging members (18) by engaging with each
of the adjacent stent-engaging members (18) to space them

apart and resist collapse of the rear wall (14) from the
distended disposition.
A fluid collection container as claimed in claim 1 wherein
when said rear wall (14) is collapsed said stent-engaging

members (18) are arranged side by side with their adjacent
long edges contiguous.
A fluid collection container as claimed in claim 1 or 2
wherein said flexible rear wall (14) includes a plurality

of collapsible and distendible walls (76, 78, 80) and
wherein said stent-engaging members (18) are connected to

at least some of said plurality of collapsible and
distendible walls, at least one of stent-engaging members

(18) having a perimeter substantially coextensive with the
perimeter of a collapsible and distendible wall to which it

is connected.
