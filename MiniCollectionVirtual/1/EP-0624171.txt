<ABSTRACT>
A novel thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) which comprises (i) polymeric A blocks in which there are side chains comprising crystallizable moieties having a melting point Tq, and (ii) at least one amorphous polymeric B block having a glass transition point, Tgs, which is less than (Tq - 10) DEG C. The relative proportions and molecular weights of the A and B blocks can be adjusted so as to produce desired physical properties with comparatively little change in Tq, which depends chiefly upon the nature of the crystallizable moieties, which may be for example n-alkyl groups containing 12 to 50 carbon atoms. The novel TPE's show a sharply reduced viscosity in the region of Tq, and can be melt-processed at temperatures close to Tq. The novel TPE's are useful in the form of compositions, shaped articles and assemblies which comprise one of the novel TPE's and a second component which is mixed with, or surrounded by, or surrounds or otherwise provides a substrate for, the TPE. Preferred second components are explosives and other energetic materials, pharmaceuticals, seeds, perfumes, deodorizers, pest control agents, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, biologically active materials, agrichemicals, and disinfectants. Second components can be released from such a composition or shaped article by a natural increase in the ambient temperature or by heating the composition or article to a temperature at least equal to Tq by means of heat which is (i) generated artificially or (ii) generated by a mammalian body and/or (iii) is conveyed artificially to the composition, article or assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomers. Thermoplastic elastomers, which are often referred to as TPE's, are well known. 
The TPE's in general use contain (i) polymeric blocks (usually referred to as "hard" blocks 
or A blocks) which (a) are amorphous and have a second order transition point, Tgh, which 
is well above room temperature, or (b) have a crystalline polymer backbone and have a 
crystalline melting point, Tmc, which is well above room temperature, and (ii) amorphous 
polymeric blocks (usually referred to as "soft" blocks or B blocks) which have a glass 
transition point, Tgs, which is well below room temperature. Each soft block is linked to at 
least two hard blocks, so that at temperatures between Tgs and Tmc, or Tgs and Tgh, the 
amorphous B blocks are tied together, resulting in elastomeric behavior. Above Tmc or 
Tgh, melting or softening of the hard blocks permits viscous flow of the polymeric chains, 
resulting in thermoplastic behavior. Known TPE's are described for example in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,361,526 (Allen), 4,483,978 (Manser), 4,764,586 (Manser), 4,778,852 
(Futamura), 4,806,613 (Wardle), 4,919,737 (Biddle et al), 4,952,644 (Wardle et al), and 
4,976,794 (Biddle et al) and in the articles in Polymer, 29 (7), 1233-1239 (1988) Kallitsis 
et al; J. Appl. Poly. Sci 37 (1), 267-281 (1989) Murphy et al; J. Poly. Sci, Part A, Poly 
Chem, 28 (9) 2393-2401 (1990) Talukder et al; Makromol Chem, 190, 1069-1078 (1989) 
Khan et al, 191, 603-614, 615-624, and 2341-2354 (1990) Fakirov et al, and 191 2355-2365 
(1990) Gogeva; and Macromolecules 18 (2), 123-127 (1985) Miyamoto et al, and 23, 
333-337 (1990) Chow. We have now realized that very valuable novel TPE's comprise A blocks which are 
crystalline and in which at least a part of the crystallinity results from the presence of 
crystallizable side chains. In particular such novel TPE's can exhibit a much more rapid 
change in viscosity in the region of the crystalline melting point of the side chains in the 
TPE (referred to herein as Tq) than is exhibited by known TPE's in the region of Tmc or 
Tgh. This rapid change in viscosity results in a number of important advantages. One 
advantage is that the novel TPE's can be processed at temperatures not far above Tq, e.g. 
below about (Tq + 10)°C, whereas known TPE's are typically processed at temperatures at  
 
least 40°C above Tmc or Tgh. Known TPE's are typically processed at temperatures above 
100°C, whereas the preferred TPE's of the invention can be processed at temperatures
