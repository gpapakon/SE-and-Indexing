<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns ligands which are 
intended mainly for radiopharmaceutical use. The 
ligands are capable of chelating radiometal species. 
The ligands are adapted to be bound, or are already 
bound, to biological targeting molecules. The conventional approach to radionuclide 
labelling of biological targeting molecules is to 
attach known radiometal complexes to the targeting 
molecule. Relatively little consideration, however, 
has been given to the impact which the radiometal 
complex may have on the biodistribution of the 
targeting molecule. Thus introduction of a complex 
which exhibits high plasma protein binding may 
significantly increase the blood levels of the complex. 
Similarly, attachment of a charged hydrophilic 
radiometal complex may adversely affect the cell 
membrane permeability of the targeting molecule. In 
both cases the biodistribution of the radiolabelled 
targeting molecule complex no longer corresponds to 
that of the unlabelled targeting molecule. The ligands DADS(1) and MAG₃ (Fritzberg, US 
4,980,147) form technetium complexes which are 
hydrophilic anions and useful as kidney function 
agents. The diaminedithiol ligand BAT (Kung, EP 
0,200,211 A1) forms a neutral lipophilic technetium 
complex which can cross the blood-brain barrier. Jones and Davison (US 4,746,505) disclosed 
the S-functionalised N₂S₂ thioether ligand shown. It 
forms a neutral technetium complex which is unstable 
with respect to S-dealkylation regenerating the parent 
DADS complex(2) . The technetium complexes of 
monoaminemonoamide (MAMA) ligands have been 
described(3). The main thrust of the work was towards 
ligands with more favourable labelling kinetics than 
diamidethiols (such as DADS). US 4,988,496 (Fritzberg) 
discloses that bifunctional MAMA derivatives are useful 
for antibody/protein labelling. US 4925650 claims the technetium complexes of 
N₂S₂ and N₃S ligands with pendant carboxyl groups as 
kidney function agents. The only ligand described is 
the diaminedithiol shown: 
   Brandau et al.(4) have described the renal 
imaging properties of a technetium complex of the 
carboxyl-substituted amine/amide/thioether/thiol ligand 
shown: 
   The nature of the technetium complex is not 
made clear in the abstract. There is a vast literature on the use of 
bifunctional chelating agents for the attachment of 
ligands to relatively high molecular weight biological 
targeting entities such as monoclonal antibodies (or 
their fragments) and proteins. Much less work has been  
 
done on coupling
