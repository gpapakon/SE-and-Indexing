<ABSTRACT>
A refractory monoblock stopper of substantially 
cylindrical configuration having an axial bore (2) provided 

therethrough for the passage of an inert gas, the outer 
surface of the stopper rod (1) being provided with an odd 

number of axial grooves (5) thereby reducing the weight of 
the stopper without loss of strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stopper used as part of a 
valve mechanism in the control of flow of molten material 
from a vessel through a submerged outlet. More 
particularly, it relates to refractory monoblock stoppers, 
i.e. one piece ceramic stopper rods as currently used to 
control the flow of molten metal exiting from a nozzle 
mounted in the bottom of a melt-containing vessel, e.g. 
ladle or tundish. This is typically applied in the casting 
of steel through an opening in the base of the tundish via 
nozzles and shrouds into a water-cooled mould. Typically, such stoppers consist of an elongate 
cylindrical refractory ceramic body of isostatically-pressed 
graphite/alumina having at the lower end a rounded or 
tapered profile suitable for engagement in the throat of a 
corresponding exit nozzle, and at the upper end some form of 
connecting means to fasten the stopper onto an external 
lifting mechanism by which the flow is controlled. Operation of the stopper is simple in principle. A 
mechanical lifting system is used to vertically lift the 
stopper rod from a seating position on the nozzle to ease or 
restrict the volume of the molten metal flowing through the 
nozzle. However, in practice, such a stopper rod has to 
operated under harsh environmental conditions such as being 
submerged in the molten metal for long periods of time and 
must be able to withstand the high thermal shocks 
encountered in the pouring processes. The present invention aims to provide an improved 
stopper. According to one aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a refractory monoblock stopper of substantially 
cylindrical configuration having an axial bore provided 
therethrough for the passage of an inert gas, the outer 
surface of the stopper rod being provided with an odd number 
of axial grooves thereby reducing the weight of the stopper 
without loss of strength. Preferably, the grooves in the outer surface of the 
stopper rod are concave in cross-section.  Advantageously, 3 or 5 grooves are equispaced in the 
outer surface of the stopper rod. Therefore this invention provides a refractory 
monoblock stopper which is characterised in that the 
exterior surface of the stopper has an undulating contour 
comprising alternate lobes and recesses to provide a fluted 
design which surprisingly retains the strength of a regular 
cylindrical stopper as known for example from EP-A-0074988 
or EP-A-0179837 yet results in significant savings in 
material. One embodiment of the present invention will now be
