constituting a part of an ink chamber (22) is displaced by a 

piezo-electric transducer (1), pressure of ink in the ink chamber 
(22) is raised and ink drops are discharged through a 

nozzle opening (13a), is characterized in that said vibrating 
membrane (20) is constituted by thin film (20a) made of macromolecular 

resin and a rigid projection portion (20b) directly 
fixed to the thin film made of the macromolecular resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording head of 
an ink jet recording apparatus of the on-demand type which 
spouts forth ink droplets toward a recording medium, such as 
a recording paper, in accordance with a print signal, thereby 
forming an ink image on the recording paper, and a method of 
manufacturing the recording head, and more particularly to 
the construction of a island-having vibrating film which forms one of the 
walls defining an ink chamber for discharging ink droplets 
and functions to transfer a vibration from a piezoelectric 
transducer to the ink chamber. An ink jet head of the called on-demand type which 
spouts forth ink droplets in accordance with a print signal 
is categorized into two types according to the type of the 
ink discharging force generating means. The first type of 
the ink jet head is a called bubble jet type of the ink jet 
head in which a heater for instantaneously vaporizing ink is 
located at the nozzle tip, and ink droplets are generated and 
spouted forth by an expanding pressure when ink is vaporized. 
The second type of the ink jet head is constructed such that 
a part of an ink chamber forming an ink reservoir is 
constructed with a piezoelectric transducer which is deformed  
 
according to a print signal, and ink droplets are impelled to 
emit forward by a pressure generated in the ink chamber by 
the deformation of the piezoelectric transducer. The on-demand type of the ink jet head as the second 
type of the ink jet head, as disclosed in Published 
Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Nos. Sho. 58-119870 
and 58-119872, is constructed such that a vibrating film 
(called a diaphragm in both the publications) forming an ink 
chamber is coupled with a second end of a piezoelectric 
transducer fastened at a first end to a base, with an island-like 
protrusion (called a leg in both the publications) 
inserted therebetween. The expanding and contracting actions 
of the piezoelectric transducer cause the piezoelectric 
transducer to push the leg and to deform the vibrating film. 
The deformed film causes ink of the ink chamber to forcibly 
emit forward in the form of ink droplets through a nozzle 
opening. Neither of the above-mentioned publications discloses 
any specific method of forming the vibrating film and the 
leg. The leg takes a complicated construction where it is 
fitted into a bearing. Therefore, it is very difficult to 
accurately manufacture and assemble the leg member and the 
bearing member for the purposes of size reduction and high 
de
