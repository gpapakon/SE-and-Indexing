<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to seal the pressure measuring connection (1), designed as a hose connection, with a closure screw (5) remaining in the internal thread (11) of the connection (1) even during the measuring process, the internal thread has three or four axially aligned interruptions (12), distributed over its periphery, which form gas passage channels in the case of the screw being loosened. In the case of the screw being tightened, a sealing surface (8) provided on the underside of the head of the screw bears on a peripheral seating edge (9) of the measuring connection (1).

Pressure measuring tap for a gas control apparatus comprising a tube-shaped 
connection branch (1) suitable for pushing thereon a flexible pressure measuring tube 

and having an internal thread (11) into which a closure screw (5) can be screwed 
tightly, 
characterized in that
 said internal thread (11) has interruptions aligned in axial 
direction which, when said closure screw is loosened, but still is held in said thread, 

form at least one axial gas flow channel. 
The pressure measuring tap of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 at least 
three gas flow channels formed by interruptions (12') of said thread are distributed 

uniformly around the circumference of said thread. 
The pressure measuring tap of claim 2, 
characterized in that
 four gas 
flow channels formed by interruptions (12a to 12d) of said thread are distributed 

uniformly around the circumference of said thread. 
The gas pressure measuring tap according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 a circumferential surface (8) of the screw head 
(7), facing the threaded portion (6) ofthe closure screw (5), together with a 

circumferential seat surface (9) within said connecting branch (1) constitutes a sealed 
closure means of said connecting branch (1) when said screw is tightened. 
The pressure measuring tap of claim 4, 
characterized in that
 said 
circumferential seat surface (9') is recessed with respect to the end (14) of said 

connecting branch by about the height of the screw head. 
The pressure measuring tap according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by
 such a steepness of the thread (6, 11) that for opening the flow 
channels (12) a half turn of said closure screw (5) is sufficient.
