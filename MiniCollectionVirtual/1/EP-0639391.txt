<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski consisting of an elongate beam (1) having a curved part (2) of length (LC) between a front contact line (20) and a rear contact line (21); the said central part comprising a region for mounting the bindings (5). The ski comprises two dampers (6, 7) arranged in the central part (2) and each on either side of the said mounting region (5). One of the ends (60, 70) of each damper is connected to the beam by a complete linkage (8); the other end (61, 71) is connected by a partial linkage means which is free to translate along a longitudinal direction and is composed of an elastic and/or viscous element (90, 91) which opposes the longitudinal displacement of the said damper; the part (62, 72), of length (IT1, IT2) of each damper between the two linkages being left free, at least in translation, with respect to the beam; the ratio (IT1) of the front damper (6) to (IT2) of the rear damper (7) lying between 1.5 and 2.5 and (IT1 + IT2)/LC lying between 0.15 and 0.25. The invention is an improvement to known ski damping devices.

Ski constituted by an elongated beam (1) having an arched 
central portion (2) of a length (LC) between a front contact 

line (20) and a rear contact line (21), a front portion (3) 
turned up into a shovel and a rear portion (4) legs raised 

into a tail, said central portion (2) comprising a binding 
mounting zone (5) corresponding to the standardized zone, said 

ski comprising two transmitters (6, 7) arranged in said 
central portion (2) and each on both sides of said binding 

mounting zone (5), one of the ends (60, 70) of each 
transmitter being connected to the beam by a fixed connection 

(8); the other end (61, 71) of each transmitter being 
connected by a partial connection means, free in translation 

along a longitudinal direction and composed of an elastic 
and/or viscous element (90, 91) that opposes the longitudinal 

displacement of said transmitter, the portion (62, 72) of 
length (l
T1
, l
T2
) of each transmitter between the two 
connections being left free in translation, at least with 

respect to the beam,
 
   characterized in that the ratio of the free length (l
T1
) 
of the front transmitter (6) to the free length (l
T2
) of the 
rear transmitter (7) is comprised between 1.5 and 2.5, and the 

ratio (l
T1
 + l
T2
) to LC being comprised between 0.15 and 0.25. 
Ski according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
and (60, 70) of each transmitter, which is connected by a 

fixed connection, is located on the side towards the front 
portion (20) or rear portion (21), respectively, the other end 

(61, 71) being located on the side towards the mounting zone 
(5).  

 
Ski according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
distance (d1) separating the front end (60) of the front 

transmitter (6) from the front contact line (20) is comprised 
between 0.18 LC and 0.25 LC. 
Ski according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that 
the distance (d2) separating the rear end (70) of the rear 

transmitter (7) from the rear contact line (21) is comprised 
between 0.16 LC and 0.21 LC. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that under flexional stress, the displacement 

(Δ1) of the rear end (61) of the front transmitter (6) with 
respect to the beam (1) is greater than the displacement (Δ2) 

of the front end (71) of the rear transmitter (7), such that 
the ratio (Δ1/Δ2) is comprised between 1.2 and 2.5. 
Ski according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
stiffness (K1) of the elastic and/or viscous means (90) of the 

front transmitter (6) is greater than the stiffness (K2) of 
the elastic and/or viscous means (91) of the rear transmitter 

(7), such that the ratio (K1/K2) is comprised between 1.2 and 
5. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the partial connection means (90, 91) is 

constituted by an interface layer of elastic or viscoelastic 
material connecting at least the lower surface of the end (61, 

71) of each transmitter (6, 7) above the beam (1), in order to 
work in shearing through the longitudinal displacement of said 

end (60, 70) with respect to the beam.  
 
Ski according to any of claims 1-6, characterized in 
that the partial connection means (90, 91) is constituted by 

a spring/abutment assembly (903, 900) connected to the beam
