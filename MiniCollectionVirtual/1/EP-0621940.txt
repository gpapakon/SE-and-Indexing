<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a plate heat exchanger for evaporation of a liquid, comprising a number of thin heat transfer plates (4), provided with corrugation pattern in the form of ridges and grooves, which in each second plate interspace for supply of said liquid have several inlet openings (18) distributed horizontally across the width of the heat transfer plates. According to the invention the heat transfer plates comprise a horizontal portion (28) having less pressing depth than the rest of the corrugation pattern, which is formed such that the heat transfer plates (4) in the area of said portions (28), abut against each other in the plate interspaces for said liquid and are separated from each other in the plate interspaces for a heating fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a plate heat exchanger for evaporation of a 
liquid, comprising a number of vertically orientated thin heat transfer plates having a 
pressed corrugation pattern in the form of ridges and grooves, the heat transfer plates 
being in abutment with gaskets arranged there between to delimit in each second plate 
interspace a flow space for said liquid and to delimit in the remaining plate interspaces 
flow spaces for a heating fluid, and several inlet openings horizontally distributed 
across the width of the heat transfer plates for supply of liquid to each flow space for 
liquid. GB-A-1299481, GB-A-1412414, GB-A-1425176 and WO-A-91/06818 
disclose plate heat exchangers in the form of falling fill evaporators in which the flow 
space for the liquid have a number of openings for inflowing liquid, for instance milk 
or saltwater to be desalted. Due to these inlet openings, between the heat transfer 
plates, one or a small number of relatively narrow rills of liquid appear. These narrow 
rills shall later be divided so that the flow or parts of the flow will be spread to an 
unbroken liquid film across the width of the heat transfer plates. For certain applications a completely even distribution of the liquid film is 
strived for. In other cases a certain uneven distribution, with larger flow per unit of 
width on some parts of the plate and lower on other parts, may be optimum depending 
on downstream conditions. Such uneven flow distributions may be obtained by 
varying the relative flow of the different rills, or by spreading the location of the rills 
unequally across the width so that rills lying closely together correspond to a larger 
flow per unit of width. Along the heat transfer surface of a falling film evaporator the liquid flow is 
gradually evaporated and it will be difficult to maintain a completely covering liquid 
film. To avoid dry surface portions the right flow distribution must be achieved in the 
upper part of the heat transfer plates. This flow need not be evenly distributed, but it 
should cover completely. Thus, in connection with falling film evaporators usually all of the heat transfer 
surface should be covered by liquid film, to avoid dry parts on the heat transfer 
surface, which would give no or insignificant heat transfer. If the liquid to be  
 
evaporated also contains non-evaporative products, a contamination of the heat 
transfer plates may occur, especially in or at dry areas, In the case of concentration of 
milk products, strong

Plate heat exchanger for evaporation of a liquid, comprising a number of 
vertically orientated thin heat transfer plates (4) having a pressed corrugation pattern 

of ridges and grooves, the heat transfer plates being in abutment with gaskets (13, 14, 
16, 25) or the like arranged there between to delimit in each second plate interspace a 

flow space for said liquid and to delimit in the remaining plate interspaces flow spaces 
for a heating fluid, and several inlet openings (18) horizontally distributed across the 

width of the heat transfer plates for supply of liquid to each flow space for liquid, 
characterised in that adjacent heat transfer plates have opposed horizontally extending 

portions (28) having a corrugation pattern with essentially less pressing depth than the 

remaining part of the corrugation pattern of the heat transfer plates, that the ridges in 
said portions (28) of two adjacent heat transfer plates (4) are crosswise arranged, and 

that the corrugation patterns are so configured that the heat transfer plates (4) in said 
portions (28), via the crosswise arranged ridges, abut against each other in the flow 

space for said liquid, but are essentially separated from each other in the flow space for 
the heating fluid. 
Plate heat exchanger according to claim 1, characterised in that said portions 
(28) of the heat transfer plates (4) are located close to the inlet openings (18) for the 

liquid. 
Plate heat exchanger according to any of the claims 1-2, characterised in that 
the corrugation pattern in said portion (28) of a heat transfer plate (4) has a smaller 

pitch than the remaining corrugation pattern. 
Plate heat exchanger according to any of the claims 1-3, characterised in that 
the corrugation pattern in said portion (28) of a heat transfer plate (4) is formed such 

that it provides larger flow resistance for said liquid than provided by the remaining  
 

corrugation pattern. 
Plate heat exchanger according to any of the claims 1-4, characterised in that 
said portion (28) of a heat transfer plate (4) has a vertical extension which is less than 

the distance between the inlet openings (18). 
Plate heat exchanger according to any of the claims 1-5, characterised in that 
said portion (28) of a heat transfer plate (4) has separate projections pressed to full 

pressing depth so that supporting means are formed between the plates in said 
remaining flow spaces. 
Plate heat exchanger according to any of the claims 1-6, characterised in that 
said remaining flow spaces have inlets for entry of a gaseous heating fluid such as 

steam. 
Plate heat exchanger according to claim 1-7, characterised in that said inlet for 
the heating fluid is so located that the fluid and said liquid will have essentially the 

same flow direction through said portions (28) in the respective flow space. 
Plate heat exchanger according to any of the claims 1-8, characterised in that- 
the angle between crossing ridges of said portions (28), in the flow direction of said 

liquid, is 60° - 80° and that the pressing depth is about 3mm.
