<ABSTRACT>
After placing an original document on a document 
platen (2) of a copying apparatus main body (1), when a detection 

switch (6) detects a predetermined angle of ϑ of a document 
cover (4) in the course of closing the document cover(4), a 

light-emitting device (51) of a distance-measuring sensor (5) is 
driven. Light released from the light-emitting device is 

projected onto the original document (3) or the document 
cover (4), and the reflected light is received by a light-receiving 

device (52). A signal corresponding to the 
light-receipt point of the light-receiving device is 

released, and a measurement is made to find the distance 
from the sensor (5) to the original document (3) or to the 

document cover (4) based on the signal. A discrimination is 
made as to the presence or absence of original document 

based on the measured distance, and copying control 

suitable for the result of the discrimination is carried 
out. At this time, if external light or other light is 

received by the light-receiving device (52), the output of the 
light-receiving device exceeds a predetermined range. 

This state is regarded as no original document is located 
above the related distance-measuring sensor, and the 

corresponding process is carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document detection
device for detecting an original document, and also
relates to a copying apparatus, provided with the document
detection device, which carries out a copying operation
while executing related operations such as, for example,
selection of copy sheets in accordance with the size of
the original document that is detected by the document
detection device.In a conventional copying apparatus, an image of an
original document is projected onto a photoreceptor that 
functions as a recording medium; an electrostatic latent
image derived from the projected image is formed thereon;
a toner image derived from the developed electrostatic
latent image is transferred onto a copy sheet that has
been positioned at a set time; the toner image on the copy
sheet is fixed thereon through a fixing device; and the
copying sheet is ejected out of the copying apparatus.The copying apparatus provides copying control
suitable for a particular original document by detecting
the presence or absence of the original document. In
order to execute the copying control, a detection means,
which detects the presence or absence of an original
document placed on a document platen where an image
exposure is made, is provided so that copy start control
is executed in accordance with the detection indicating
the presence or absence of the original document, or a
plurality of means, which detect the presence or absence
of the original document as well as detecting the size of
the original document, are provided so that automatic
selection of copying sheets or automatic setting for
copying magnification, etc. is made in accordance with the
detected size.A conventional document detection device has a
construction provided with a sensor that allows a
light-emitting device (LED), installed, for example, below 
a transparent document platen placed on the top of the
copying apparatus, to emit light toward the original
document side as well as allowing a light-receiving device
to receive the reflected light or the transmitted light,
and this construction makes it possible to detect the
presence or absence of the original document. Further, a
plurality of those sensors capable of detecting the
presence or absence of the original document are installed
in the document detection device in accordance with the
sizes of original documents to be placed thereon; this
construction makes it possible to detect the presence or
absence of the original document as well as detecting the
size of the original
