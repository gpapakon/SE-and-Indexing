<ABSTRACT>
When, for example horizontal lines are displayed on a display screen of a 
display device, they may exhibit a field distortion, predominantly in the form of gulling 

distortion which becomes manifest as a sinewave-shaped line instead of the horizontal 
line to be displayed. 
To correct this field distortion, a correction is generated by means of a 
field distortion correction circuit and a resonant circuit, dependent on the location on 

the display screen, which correction is added to the field deflection current so that the 
picture to be displayed is corrected for this error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display device comprising a display tube with a 
display screen, a deflection unit for deflecting at least one electron beam generated in 
the display tube, said deflection unit comprising at least a line deflection coil and a field 
deflection coil, and a field distortion correction circuit coupled to the deflection unit for 
correcting the field deflection. The invention also relates to a field distortion correction circuit. A display device of the type described above is known from European 
Patent Application EP-A 201336. The display device described in this Patent 
Application comprises a field distortion correction circuit using a non-linear reactor, for 
example a saturable transformer, in which a first modulation current having a frequency 
which is a harmonic of the line frequency is applied to an input winding of the 
reactor/transformer. This first modulation current is modulated by means of a signal at 
the field frequency. This makes it possible to correct pincushion distortion and/or 
gulling distortion. A drawback of this known display device including a field distortion 
correction circuit is that the reactor (saturable induction)/transformer used therein is 
expensive and that it is a large, complicated component having many branches, while 
the reactor does not have a satisfactory temperature stability. A further drawback of the 
reactor/transductor is that this element has a very detrimental influence on other 
elements of the display device.  It is an object of the invention to provide a display device which does not 
have the above-mentioned drawbacks. To this end a display device according to the 
invention is characterized in that the field distortion correction circuit comprises a 
resonant circuit with a series arrangement of an inductance and a capacitor and a 
bidirectionally conducting line frequency-controlled switch, the inductance being 
coupled to the field deflection coil and the field distortion correction circuit being 
adapted to receive an uncorrected field deflection current and line deflection current at a 
first and a second input, respectively, and to supply a corrected field deflection current 
at an output. By controlling the field distortion correction circuit by means of a 
bidirectionally conducting switch, it is ensured that the reactor/transductor required in 
the known display device can be dispensed with so that a simpler and more accurate 
correction of the field distortion (pincushion) and gulling distortion can be obtained.
