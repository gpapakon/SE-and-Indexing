<ABSTRACT>
For the evaluation of a prescribed combination of bits, represented by high and low intensity levels, of a plurality of optical signals, the signals having a high intensity level in the prescribed combination are converted into optical signals of low intensity, using an optical inverting device, the signals thus available being combined by means of a coupler and fed to a detection device which emits a significant result only when the sum of the intensities of the signals led together is smaller than the high intensity level of an individual optical signal. Further refinements relate to the asynchronous detection of signal words carried along in a serially transmitted optical signal and having characteristic bit sequences, and to the detection of random combinations of the plurality of optical signals.

Arrangement for evaluating a prescribed
combination of bits, represented by high or low

intensity levels, of a plurality of optical signals
(S1...S4), comprising


a plurality of glass fibre lines for guiding in
each case one optical signal,
a coupler (KOP) whose inputs are connected to the
glass fibre lines, for summing the optical signals

fed to its inputs,
a detector (DET) with a threshold discriminator
whose input is connected to the output of the

coupler,

characterized in that

respective inverting devices (INV1, INV2) are
inserted into the fraction of glass fibre lines

which, given the presence of the prescribed
combination of signals, guides bits represented by

high intensity levels, and
a significant result can be supplied at the output
of the detector only if the signal fed to its

input has a lower intensity level than the high
intensity level of an individual optical signal.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized

in that

a glass fibre line is provided for guiding a
serially transmitted optical signal in which a 

prescribed sequence of characteristic bits forms a
signal word,
the glass fibre line is connected via a splitter
(SP) to the majority of glass fibre lines for

feeding the optical signal, and
a time-delay device (VER1...VER4) is arranged in
each of the plurality of glass fibre lines in such

a way that the optical signal is delayed by the
order of priority of a characteristic bit inside

the signal word.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the detector is provided by an

optical inverter.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the inverting device is provided

by an optical inverter.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 3 or 4,
characterized in that the optical inverter is provided

by the series connection of a photodiode and a light-emitting
semiconductor element.
Arrangement according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the light-emitting semiconductor element is

provided by a laser diode.
Arrangement according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the light-emitting semiconductor element is

provided by a light-emitting diode (LED).
Method for evaluating a prescribed combination
of bits, represented by high or low intensity levels,

of a plurality of optical signals, in accordance with
which


the optical signals are combined and
the sum of the intensities of the combined optical
signals is evaluated,

characterized in that

the bits, represented by high intensity levels, of
the prescribed combination are inverted into low

intensity levels before being combined, and 
a significant result is determined only if the sum
of the intensities of the combined signals is

smaller than the high intensity level of an
individual optical signal.
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in
that


the plurality of optical signals (S1..S4) are
generated by splitting a serially transmitted

optical signal (SÃœS) into the plurality of
signals, and
each split signal is delayed inside the serially
transmitted optical signal in accordance with the

order of priority of a high or low intensity
level.
Method according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized
in that each individual one of the plurality of optical

signals can be switched to be inactive.
