<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process
for recovering energy from a combustible gas generated
during gasification of cellulose waste liquors, the
improvement comprising a cooling zone, wherein the
combustible gas is cooled to a temperature below 150°C,
simultaneously recovering sensible and latent heat in
one or more heat exchangers, discharging the cooled
combustible gas for use as fuel in a water and/or steam
injected recuperative gas turbine cycle.The kraft process is currently the dominant chemical
pulping process. During pulping large quantities of
recoverable energy in the form of black liquor is
generated. Worldwide some 2.8 billion GJ (780 TWh) of
black liquor was produced in 1990 at kraft pulp mills.The kraft recovery system has two principal functions:
i) Recovery and recure of the inorganic pulping
chemicals.ii) Recovery of the energy value of the organic material
as process steam and electrical power.The chemical recovery process contributes significantly
to the capital intensity of the kraft process. About
35% of the capital cost of a modern pulp mill is attributable
to the recovery process.The predominant method today for recovery of chemicals
and energy from black liquor is the Tomlinson recovery
boiler, a technology which was introduced well over
fifty years ago. Although an established technology,
there are some wellknown disadvantages with conventional
recovery technology.Most often the recovery boiler with its inherent inflexibility
constitutes the main production bottleneck
in the pulp mill. Economics of scale dictate large
capacity units.Other disadvantages include the low thermal efficiency
and risk of smelt water explosions which in turn constitute
a safety problem.These and other areas of concern have been the driving
force for development of new methods and principles for
recovering chemicals and energy from black liquor. One
of the more promising routes is gasification of the
liquor in entrained or fluidized beds. In some cases
these alternative processes can be installed as incremental
capacity boosters, providing an opportunity to
eliminate the recovery boiler bottleneck.One of the major driving forces for development of new
recovery technology has been to improve thermal efficiency
accompanied with higher power to steam output
ratios. The present invention relates to a major 
improvement in this area, using technology based on
gasification and energy recovery in a recuperated gas
turbine cycle.Gasification of black liquor can be performed at various
temperatures
