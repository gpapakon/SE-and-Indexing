<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vibration-damping constructions and a method 
useful for damping vibratory and/or noise emitting structures and component 
parts of devices such as automohiles, aircraft, industrial equipment, and 
appliances. This vibration-damping construction comprising at least a single 
layer of a thermoset resin. This invention further relates to a process of 
preparing the thermoset resins. As technology moves toward energy conservation with the concomitant 
drive towards light weight structures that move at faster speeds and operate at 
higher temperatures, the acoustic and vibratory responses become larger and 
less desirable. It has long been known that the vibration of component parts of devices 
and structures that vibrate under the influence of an applied internal or external 
force can be substantially reduced by the attachment of a layer of viscoelastic 
material. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,640,836 (Oberst et al.) describes a 
vibration-damping laminate in which the viscoelastic layer is a polymer 
comprised of ethylene, vinyl acetate and acrylic and/or methacrylic acid. U.S. 
Patent No. 3,847,726 (Becker et al.) describes a viscoelastic adhesive 
composition of a polyepoxide, a polyether amine, a heterocyclic amine, and a 
phenol useful as vibration-damping material over a -25° to +60°C range. Such 
compositions, however, are not effective for vibration-damping over prolonged 
periods of time at elevated temperatures. U.S. Patent No. 3,833,404 (Sperling et al.) describes viscoelastic 
damping compositions comprising an interpenetrating polymer network 
composition consisting essentially of 5-95 % by weight of a polyalkyl acrylate  
 
elastomer, for example, polyethyl acrylate or polybutyl acrylate, polyvinyl 
acetate, polyurethane, polybutadiene, natural rubber, silicone rubber, butyl 
rubber, chloroprene, ethylene propylene terepolymer elastomers, polyvinyl 
alcohol, thiol rubber, and copolymers thereof; and 95-5 % by weight of a 
plastic, such as polystyrene, poly-α-methyl styrene, polyalkyl acrylates, for 
example, polymethyl methacrylate or polyethyl methacrylate, poly-1-alkenes, 
for example, polypropylene, polyacrylic acid, and copolymers thereof, together 
with an outer plastic constraining layer. Epoxies have traditionally been used as constraining layers in damping 
constructions since they do not exhibit any significant damping due to their 
highly crosslinked networks. Although U.S. Patent No. 3,833,404 considers 
epoxy for the constraining layer, epoxy is not
