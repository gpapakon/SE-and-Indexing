<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates principally to a method of producing a covering (1), particularly for floors, to a covering obtained by means of this method, as well as to a method of laying the said covering. According to the invention, grooves (2) are made, for example in sheets of wood, which are filled with flexible adhesive (3). After the adhesive has set, an ablation of the material between the grooves, advantageously over a depth less than the depth of the groove, uncovers the projecting contact strips.

A process of manufacture of a surface covering, especially a
ground covering comprising stages consisting of:


a) making in a plank or lath of wood (1) of more or less constant
thickness, first ablations forming first recesses (2, 2,1) ;
b) filling the first recesses (2, 2.1) with a flexible adhesive flush
with the surface of the plate or lath (1);
c) leaving the adhesive to solidify,

characterised in that it comprises a stage consisting in ;

d) making a second ablation of wood in the face of the plate or lath
(1, 11) including the depositing of adhesive flush with the surface while clearing

away protruding deposits of adhesive likely to form contact strips (3.1).
A process in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that the
depth (E3) of the second ablation is constant over the whole surface of the plank

or plate (1,11), this depth (E3) being between 0.5 and 5 mm.
A process in accordance with claim 2, characterised in that the
depth (E3) of the second ablation is between 1 and 3 mm.
A process in accordance with any one of the preceding claims
characterised in that in stage a) or between stages a) or b) a third ablation is

made forming second recesses (2.2), preferably of a depth less than the depth of
the first ablation, in that in stage b), in addition to the first recesses (2.1 ), the third

recesses (2.2) are filled with adhesive, and in that between stages b) and c), the
planks or laths (1) are stacked to form a block of wood which is cut into sections

forming planks or laths (11).
A process in accordance with claim 4, characterised in that the
third recesses (2.2) are filled in stage b) with an adhesive having mechanical

properties different from those of the adhesive applied to fill the first recesses
(2.1).
A process in accordance with claim 5, characterised in that the
filling adhesive of the third recesses presents in the solid state a rigidity greater

than that of the adhesive applied to the filling of the first recesses (2,1).
A process in accordance with claims 4, 5 or 6, characterised in
that the filling adhesive of the third recesses (2.2) is a coloured adhesive.
A process in accordance with any one of the preceding claims.
characterised in that the recess or recesses (2.1, 2.2) is (are) filled with adhesive

by injection or extrusion.
A process of making a floor covering, characterised in that it
comprises stages consisting of:


a) making in a plank or lath of wood (1) of more or less constant
thickness, initial ablations forming first recesses (2, 2.1) ;
b) filling the first recesses (2, 2.1) with a flexible adhesive flush
with the surface of the plate or lath (1);
c) leaving the adhesive to solidify ;

characterised in that it comprises a stage consisting in :

d) making a second ablation of wood on the face of the plate or lath
(1, 11) comprising the depositing of adhesive flush with the surface while

clearing away protruding deposits of adhesive likely to form contact strips (3.1); 
e) bringing the obtained ground covering contact strips (3.1) into
direct contact with a support (4).
A process in accordance with claim 9, characterised in that the
depth (E3) of the second ablation is constant over the whole surface of the plank

or plate (1, 11); this depth (E3) being between 0.5 and 5 mm, preferably between
1 and 3 mm.
