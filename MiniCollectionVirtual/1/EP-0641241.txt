<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
installation and maintenance of systems for distributing 
highly purified gases in controlled environments, such 
as integrated circuit manufacturing equipment. More 
particularly, it relates to a method for purifying 
such distribution systems after their fabrication or 
maintenance procedures that introduce contamination to 
the gas distribution system. The fabrication of integrated circuits requires the 
use of large quantities of purified gases, such as 
nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and helium that are as 
particle free as possible, used in a clean room or 
laminar flow hoods. The presence of contaminants, such 
as particulate matter or unwanted moisture in the gases 
will result in defective integrated circuits, either 
reducing yields of acceptable circuits or making it 
impossible to fabricate any circuits that meet 
specifications. In order to distribute the purified 
gases to an integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing  
 
equipment, a gas distribution system free of contaminants 
is required. It is conventional practice in the industry to 
fabricate the components of the gas distribution system 
themselves in a clean room environment. However, when 
such components are assembled together to make the gas 
distribution system, working with pipes, including 
brazing or welding them, contaminates components which 
are initially free of contamination with particulate 
matter. Because it is impossible as a practical matter 
to carry out all of the gas distribution system assembly 
in a controlled environment, such as a glove box, 
unwanted moisture is also introduced into the gas 
distribution system. Particulate and moisture 
contamination is also introduced into existing purified 
gas distribution systems whenever those systems are 
disturbed, such as during maintenance or modification 
of the systems. Conventional practice in the industry for 
eliminating such contamination is to run purified gas 
through the system until the output from the system is 
pure enough, e.g., until the moisture content and 
particulate level in the gas are low enough. This 
approach consumes large amounts of the purified gas in 
a wasteful manner until a steady state purified condition 
is reached. Such an approach is also time consuming, 
since it will often take considerable time, such as a 
matter of several days, before the steady state purified 
condition is reached. A need therefore exists for an 
improved method for purifying such gas 
distribution systems.

<CLAIMS>
A method for purifying a gas distribution 
system, which comprises connecting a heater through a 

filter to the gas distribution system, supplying gas to 
the heater, heating the gas with the heater to produce 

heated gas, supplying the heated gas to the filter, 
filtering the heated gas with the filter to produce 

heated and filtered gas, supplying the heated and 
filtered gas through the gas distribution system to an 

outlet, measuring moisture level and particulate level 
of the gas at the outlet until predetermined moisture 

and particulate levels are obtained at the outlet, and 
stopping flow of the heated and filtered gas through the 

gas distribution system when the predetermined levels 
are obtained. 
The method of Claim 1 in which the heater is 
an electrical resistance heater. 
The method of Claim 8 in which the gas is heated 
to a temperature of at least about 100Â°C.
