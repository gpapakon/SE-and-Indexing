<ABSTRACT>
The method is essentially characterised in that a sensitive element is arranged on the surface, which sensitive element initially takes on a temperature substantially corresponding to that of the surface, and a first heating phase, up to a temperature greater than the temperature of the surface, then a cooling phase, down to a temperature lower than the temperature of the surface, are caused on this sensitive element, and a comparison is made between the ratio of the duration of the first heating phase (to) to the rise in temperature during the heating ( DELTA T) and the ratio of the duration of the cooling phase (t'1) to the decrease in temperature during the cooling, a significant difference between these two ratios being indicative of a risk of condensation on the surface. The device includes all the elements allowing the method to be implemented. It may, in particular, comprise a Peltier effect module.

Process for detecting a risk of condensation of
water on a surface lying in contact with a volume of

humid air, according to which the following steps are
carried out:


a) on the surface (1) is arranged a sensitive
element (2; 40) which initially takes a temperature

corresponding substantially to that of the surface (1),
b) a first phase of heating up to a temperature
greater than the temperature of the surface (1) is

effected on this sensitive element (2; 40) with the aid
of a means of heating (5, 7; 35),
c) a phase of cooling is effected on the sensitive
element (2; 40), characterized in that the cooling

phase is effected with the aid of a means of cooling (4,
6; 35) having the same thermal power as the means of

heating (5, 7; 35), the cooling taking place down to a
temperature below the temperature of the surface (1),

   and in that the following additional step is
executed:

   d) a comparison is made between the ratio of the
duration of the first heating phase (to) to the rise in

temperature during the heating (ΔT) and the ratio of the
duration of the cooling phase (t
1
, t'
1
) to the reduction
in temperature during cooling (2ΔT), an appreciable

difference between these two ratios being indicative of
a risk of condensation on the surface (1).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the upper temperature corresponding to the temperature

of the sensitive element (2; 40) at the end of the 
first heating phase is fixed in advance by adding a

predetermined temperature deviation (ΔT) to the temperature
(Tinit) of the surface (1); and in that the lower

temperature corresponding to the temperature of the
sensitive element (2; 40) at the end of the cooling phase

is fixed by deducting the same predetermined temperature
deviation (ΔT) from the temperature (Tinit) of the

surface (1); and in that the duration (t
0
) of the first
heating phase is compared with half the duration (t
1
) of
the cooling phase.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that a second phase of heating of the sensitive element

(1) with the aid of a means of heating (5, 7; 35) is
carried out after the cooling phase, in such a way as to

bring the temperature of the sensitive element (1) back
to that which it had (Tinit+ΔT) before the cooling phase.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the duration (t
0
) of the first heating phase is
compared with a quarter of the total duration (t) of a

cycle consisting of a cooling phase and of a second
heating phase.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the comparison is made between the first heating

phase and the second heating phase.
Process according to any one of Claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that the total duration of a cycle which

is known not to have given rise to any condensation is
stored; and in that the duration of the subsequent cycles

is compared with this stored duration.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that a Peltier effect module (35) is

used as sensitive element and as means of heating and
cooling, the temperature variations of the sensitive

element being evaluated by measuring the Seebeck component
of the voltage at the terminals of the Peltier

effect module (35).
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the Seebeck component (Up) of the voltage (U) at the

terminals of the Peltier effect module (35) is obtained 
by eliminating a constant component (aUo) representative

of the voltage due to the internal resistance of the
Peltier effect module (35) at constant temperature in the

voltage (U) at the terminals of the Peltier effect module
(35).
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the Seebeck component (Up) of the voltage (U) at the

terminals of the Peltier effect module (35) is obtained
by eliminating a variable component due to the internal

resistance of the Peltier effect module (35) at the mean
temperature of the said Peltier effect module (35) in the

voltage (U) at its terminals.
Device for implementing the process according to
any one of Claims 1 to 9, including: a sensitive element

(2) able to be applied against the surface (1) and to
take a temperature substantially equal to that of the

surface (1); a means of heating (5, 7) and a means of
cooling (4, 6) which are able to heat and respectively

cool the said sensitive element (2); a means (3) of
measuring the temperature of the sensitive element (2);

a comparator of the temperature measured in the sensitive
element (2) with upper and lower values fixed in advance;

a control facility which triggers a phase of heating
until the temperature of the sensitive element (2) has

reached the upper value, then a phase of cooling until
the temperature of the sensitive element (2) has reached

the lower value; characterized in that the means of
heating and the means of cooling exhibit the same thermal

power; and in that the said device furthermore includes a
clock for measuring the duration (t
0
) of the heating
phase and that (t
1
) of the cooling phase,and a comparator
for comparing the ratio of the duration of heating (t
0
)
to the rise in temperature during heating (ΔT) and the

ratio of the duration of cooling (t
1
) to the drop in
temperature during cooling (2ΔT), the comparator warning

of the risk of condensation in the event of an appreciable
difference between these two ratios.
Device for implementing the process according to
any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that it 

includes a Peltier effect module (35) supplied with
current (I) through an electronic circuit (36) which

reverses the direction of the current (I) each time the
Seebeck component (Up) of the voltage (U) at the

terminals of the Peltier effect module (35) exceeds a
predetermined value (Uc, Uf).
