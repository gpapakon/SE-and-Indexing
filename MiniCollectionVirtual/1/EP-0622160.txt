<ABSTRACT>
A method of precision cutting fabric material (206) while obtaining 
cleanly 

cut edges involves placing the material (206) on a flat support surface 
(302), identifying 

one or more regions of material to be cut, placing adhesive tape 
(202,204) on both sides 

of the material (206), and then using an appropriate tool (302,304,306) 
to first squeeze the tape 

into the fabric at the cutting region, and effecting the cutting of the 
taped 

material. A reinforcing woven fabric constituent for incorporation into a 
metal matrix composite, produced by the method, is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the cutting of fabric materials, and
more particularly to a method for cutting mesh fabric materials
so as to obtain cleanly cut edges which are also true to the shape intended
where cutting has taken place.Present day materials used for advanced design aerospace structures
must exhibit exceptional structural strength characteristics, while at the
same time permit significant reduction in overall weight. One class of these
materials are typically referred to as "composites", and include both organic
and metal reinforced matrices. Reinforcing materials typically used in composites are provided as
fibers. Generally, the fibers consist of materials such as metals, a
combination of carbon and graphite, or ceramics. These fibers may be
incorporated in a matrix material as randomly arranged pieces, as an ordered
arrangement of tow, as an ordered mesh arrangement including one or more
layers of the fibers, or as an arrangement of continuous fibers woven in a
fabric.One of the most difficult problems faced today in the use of fabric
reinforcing materials is the cutting of the material so as to achieve a
cleanly cut edge true to the angular curvilinear or straight line
configuration intended to be formed.Typically, the reinforcing fibers are stiffest in one direction (e.g.
in the axial direction of the fibers themselves) and the soft cross-weave
fibers (e.g., materials such as molybdenum and titanium-niobium) in the some
other direction. As a result, the fabric material has a tendency not to lay
flat or straight, and handling causes the soft cross-weave to shift, pinch or
break. When the material is cut at any angle other than parallel to the axial
direction of the reinforcing fibers, these problems are multiplied and the
fabric material fails to behave in a manner conducive to attaining the desired
result. In fact, the fabric material, cut in such an "off-axis" direction,
typically yields an uneven, jagged edge and exhibits multiple breaks in the
cross-weave fibers. The more acute the angle, the greater the problem. The current practice of using a paper cutter or of cutting the
material manually with a utility knife or scissors has consistently yielded
undesirable results. In addition, such conventional techniques for cutting,
when applied to this type of material, are time consuming, extremely cost
inefficient and impractical, especially when working with larger size pieces
(e.g., over two feet in length or width).Further, attention is drawn to the Patent abstracts of Japan,

A method for cutting reinforcing fibers woven as a fabric, where
(he edges of the cut fabric along the lines of the cut are clean and

continuous, comprising:

placing the fabric on a substantially flat surface (302),
smoothing and flattening the fabric against the surface (302),
covering the surface of the fabric facing away from said support
surface (302) with adhesive tape (202; 204),
turning said fabric over and covering the surface of the fabric
now facing away from said support surface with said adhesive tape (202; 204), and
cutting said fabric with a tool (306) to form an edge, wherein

   the step of cutting the fabric
with a tool to form an edge includes squeezing opposite

sides of the tape-covered fabric prior to severance be
ing effected, so that in the region in which the cut

edges are subsequently formed the tape is pressed into
the mesh of the woven fibres.
The method of claim 1, wherein said edge is linear.
The method of claim 1, wherein said edge is curvilinear. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said tool (306) is an automated tool.
The method of claim 1, wherein said tool (306) is a conventional hand
tool.
The method of claim 1, wherein said steps of covering said
fabric surfaces with said adhesive tape (202; 204) includes pressing said tape

against said fabric to cause said tape (202; 204) to flow into the spaces (212)
between the fabric fibers and thereby maintain the spacing between

the fibers.
The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein after squeezing opposite sides of
said tape-covered fabric, said fabric is severed in a predetermined

manner to remove a portion thereof having a predetermined
configuration. 
The method of claim 7, wherein said portion has a rectilinear
configuration.
The method of claim 7, wherein said portion is polygonal in
configuration.
The method of claim 9, wherein said polygonal configuration is a
square.
The method of claim 9, wherein said polygonal configuration is
a rectangle.
The method of claim 7, wherein said portion has a curvilinear
configuration.
The method of claim 7, wherein said portion includes a
preexisting edge of said fabric.
