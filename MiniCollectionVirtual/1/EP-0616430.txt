<ABSTRACT>
An output buffer circuit for limiting ground bounce 
or output signal ringing. The output buffer utilizes 

two pull down transistors connected to two separate 
grounds as well as two pull up transistors connected to 

two separate V
DD
 power supplies. When the buffer output 
is switched from high to low, a one shot switching means 

is provided for switching on a first pull down 
transistor connected to a noisy ground for a short time 

delay period allowing ground bounce to occur on the 
noisy ground, and then switching on the second pull down 

transistor connected to a quiet ground while switching 
the first pull down transistor off. Similarly, the one 

shot switching means switches between the two pull up 
transistors to limit output signal ringing on a quiet V
DD
 
power supply. The buffer circuit further includes a 

lead frame with separate noisy and quiet ground leads 

terminating in a single pin, with the noisy and quiet 
ground leads overlying a floating conductive plane to 

reduce mutual inductance. Further, buffer input signal 
polarity control is provided with a limited number of 

gate delays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to buffers 
such as output buffers with 
circuitry to reduce ground bounce and increase circuit 
operation speed. A preferred arrangement of the present 
invention relates to output buffers for programmable 
array logic (PAL) devices. Attempts to achieve higher speed from output buffers 
has resulted in sacrificing output signal distortion due 
to ground bounce or output signal ringing. Ground bounce has two outward manifestations: 
First, with all inputs of a chip referenced to chip 
ground, if the ground bounce is high enough, 2.4V for 
instance, an input at a TTL high can momentarily appear 
to be a low. Second, an output which is in a low state 
can momentarily bounce to a high state because the 
output is effectively connected to chip-ground through 
the pull-down output transistor. Fig. 1 illustrates the ground bounce effect with a 
typical prior art output driver consisting of two output 
buffers 100 and 102 connected to a common ground lead 
108. Assume initially that pull down transistor 104 of 
buffer 100 is off making output 1 high while pull down 
transistor 106 is on making output 2 low. When 
transistor 104 turns on switching output 1 from high to 
low with transistor 106 remaining on, the increase in 
current through the ground lead 108 results in a ground 
bounce that shows up on output 2. Output 2 may thus 
momentarily appear to be in a high state.  
 
As can be seen from Fig. 1, ground bounce is an undesirable 
effect often associated with high speeds output buffers 
used on devices containing multiple output buffers such as 
the AmPALCE22V10 manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, 
Inc. Fig. 2 shows a block diagram for the AmPALCE22V10 with 
output buffers 200(a-j). Output buffers 200(a-j) receive 
a signal from programmable array logic through output logic 
macrocells 202. the output logic macrocells 202 allow 
selection of whether the output if registered or 
combinatorial. When a number of output buffers, such as 
buffers 200(a-j), are hooked to capacitive loads and are 
switched from high to low simultaneously, the current 
through the ground lead will increase by an amount equal to 
the slew-rate times the capacitive load per output times 
the number of outputs being switched. Ground bounce is 
equal to the rate of change of this current times the 
inductance of the ground lead. In prior art PAL devices ground bounce has been 
controlled by limiting the slew-rate of the output buffer. 
In fact, the slew-rate is programmable on the AmPALCE22V10 
as
