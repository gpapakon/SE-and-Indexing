<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a glider with a head portion (1), a 
connecting portion (3) and a bottom portion (4), the 

connecting portion (3) having a smaller side than the 
bottom side of the head portion or the upper side of the 

bottom portion, the bottom portion being asymmetrical, and 
an eye(10), intended to bear a curtain hook towards one 

side, having been shifted to an outer surface (14) of the 
bottom portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a glider for hanging a curtain on 
a curtain rail, comprising a head portion having a lower 
surface with a first width, below the head portion a 
connecting portion with a second width smaller than the 
first width, and underneath it a bottom portion with a 
third width greater than the second width, the connecting 
portion being widthwise located halfway the head portion 
and the bottom portion, and the bottom portion being 
provided with an eye, in which a curtain hook attached to a 
curtain can be inserted, which eye, seen widthwise, is 
located on one side of the width of the bottom portion. Such a glider is known from the Swiss patent CH-A-539.414. 
With such a glider, with the eye for a curtain hook located 
at one side, it becomes possible to hang curtains that 
extend above the curtain rail. Also with the suspension 
point for the curtain hook shifted to one side, the forces 
exerted by the weight of the curtain on the glider are no 
longer only in a vertical direction. Specially with long 
and heavy curtains a considerable force is exerted on the 
eye, and the attachment of the eye to the glider. The eye of the known Swiss glider is formed by two slits in 
a plane, the slits being perpendicular to each other. One 
of the slits divides the plane in two separate parts and 
the other slit cuts into the said two parts. As a result 
the attachment of the eye to the glider is only along two 
short boundary lines of the said two parts, which two lines 
are perpendicular to the component of the force acting 
perpendicular to the two parts. As a result of which that, 
with heavy curtains, part of the eye may break of the 
glider or that the parts give way to such extent that the 
curtain hook may slip out of the eye. The invention aims to provide a glider with an eye located 
at one side with an attachment of the eye to the glider 
that is of sufficient strenght to hold even the heaviest  
 
curtains, without raising the cost price of the glider. The aforementioned aims are attained in accordance with the 
invention by providing that the eye has a first wall and a 
second wall, the second wall is located opposite the first 
wall, which is the outside wall, and the second wall is 
lying on a curved surface that runs from a point parallel 
to the first wall to approximately the middle of the 
gliders width. Besides sufficient strength, with this construction also an 
attractive appearance is obtained. As a matter of fact, the glider may be of a type known per 
se. It is, for

Glider for hanging a curtain (25) on a curtain rail 
(18), comprising a head portion (1) having a lower surface 

(2) with a first width, below the head portion a connecting 
portion (3) with a second width smaller than the first 

width, and underneath it a bottom portion (4) with a third 
width greater than the second width, the connecting portion 

being widthwise located halfway the head portion and the 
bottom portion, and the bottom portion being provided with 

an eye (10), in which a curtain hook attached to a curtain 
can be inserted, which eye, seen widthwise, is located on 

one side of the width of the bottom portion, 
characterized 
in that
 the eye (10) has a first wall (14) and a 
second wall (15), the second wall (15) is located opposite 

the first wall (14), which is the outside wall, and the 
second wall (15) is lying on a curved surface that runs 

from a point parallel to the first wall (14) to 
approximately the middle (16) of the gliders width.  

 
Glider as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
first wall (14) of the eye is located in a surface that on that 

side is aligned with the adjoining end of the bottom 
portion's width. 
Glider as claimed in claims 1-2, 
characterized in that
 
the glider is made of rigid elastic synthetic material and 

that it accommodates a slit (5) in the middle of the head 
portion (1). 
Glider as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
slit (5) has a trapezium-shaped profile, its short parallel 

side (6) being parallel to the bottom surface (2) of the 
head portion.  

 
Glider as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
short parallel side (6) is situated approximately at the same 

height as the bottom surface (2) of the head portion. 
Construction comprising a curtain rail (18) which has in its 
bottom side a slot (19) and at the upper corners a slightly 

protruding reinforcement rib (20), a ceiling support (17) 
clutching around said ribs, 
characterized in that
 the 
construction comprises a glider as claimed in any of the preceding 

claims.
