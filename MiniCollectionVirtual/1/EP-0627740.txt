<ABSTRACT>
A data register structure includes a 
plurality of memory cells (32 - 47; 225 - 272) 

connected to a word line and grouped into groups 
assigned to respective different addresses, each of the 

memory cells being connected to first and second bit 
lines paired, a write control unit (53, 54) for 

controlling potentials of the first and second bit 
lines connected to memory cells into which data is to 

be written, and a read control unit (55 - 58) for 
detecting potentials of either first or second bit 

lines connected to memory cells from which data is to 
be read.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
semiconductor integrated circuit devices, and more
particularly to a semiconductor integrated circuit
device such as a one-chip microcomputer device. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a data
register provided in a data processing device such as a
one-chip microcomputer.Fig. 1 shows a one-chip microcomputer device.
As shown in Fig. 1, the device includes a chip body 1,
a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 2, a ROM (Read Only
Memory) 3, a RAM (Random Access Memory) 4, a peripheral
circuit 5, and an I/O (Input/Output) port 6. The ROM 3
is mainly used to store programs executed by the CPU 2.
The RAM 4 is mainly used to temporarily store data.
The peripheral circuit 5 is, for example, an A/D
(Analog-to-Digital) converter, or a D/A (Digital-to-Analog)
converter.The CPU 2 is configured as shown in Fig. 2
which shows an essential part of the CPU 2. A program
counter (PC) 7 outputs the address of an instruction to
be fetched. An instruction register (IR) 8 stores the
taken-out instruction. An instruction decoder (DEC) 9
decodes the instruction stored in the instruction
register 8. A data register (DR) 10 is used as a "note
or working area". An arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
11 performs arithmetic and logical operations. Read
data is output to read buses 12 and 13. A write bus 14
is used to supply the data register 10 with write data
to be written into the data register 10.Fig. 3 shows an essential part of the data 
register 10. As shown in Fig. 3, the data register 10
includes memory cells 1511 through 1545, write-use word
lines WL11, WL21, WL31, WL41, and read-use word lines
WL12, WL22, WL32, WL42, WL13, WL23, WL33, and WL43.
Further, the data register 10 includes write-use bit
lines BL11, BL12, BL21, BL22, BL31, BL41, BL42, BL51
and BL52, read-use bit lines BL13, BL14, BL23, BL24,
BL33, BL34, BL43, BL44, BL53 and BL54.The memory cells 1511 through 1545 have an
identical circuit configuration. By way of example,
the memory cell 1511 is shown in Fig. 4. The memory
cell 1511 has an SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)
cell structure, and includes a flip-flop 16 having two
inverters 17 and 18 connected in a ring formation, two
nMOS (n-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistors
19 and 20 for use in writing data, and two nMOS
transistors 21 and 22 for use in reading data. These
transistors 19 - 22 function as transfer gates.When data is written into the memory cell
1511, the word line WL11 is switched to a high (H)
level and the word lines WL12 and WL13 are
