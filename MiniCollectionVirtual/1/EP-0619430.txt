<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an internal gear pump which can also be designed as a pump with suction control. It is an object of the invention to prevent the undesirable cavitation effects in the pressure zone and to make it possible for oil to flow out from the shrinking delivery cells (17.1, 17.2) between the teeth of the gear wheels. To this end, an impedance-controlled transfer port (33) is provided whose orifices (30, 31) towards the moving delivery cells are alternately opened and closed by the teeth of at least one of the gear wheels (2, 3).

Internal ring gear pump for a wide speed range, 
comprising 


a housing (1, 41) containing a gear chamber (2), 
a ring gear (3, 43) in the housing (1, 41), 
a pinion (4, 44) which has one tooth or only a few 
teeth less than the ring gear (3, 43), meshes with the 

ring gear (3, 43) and is arranged in the latter, 
the teeth of which form together with the teeth of 
the ring gear (3, 43) increasing and again diminishing 

consecutive displacement cells (13, 17, 17.1, 17.2) 
for the working liquid and seal said cells with 

respect to each other, 
inlet and outlet passages (12, 21, 52, 61) passing 
through the housing (1, 41) for the supply and 

discharge of the operating liquid, 
which open into the gear chamber (2) on both sides of 
the point (7) of deepest tooth engagement, 
said openings (11, 20, 51, 62) being passed over by 
the displacement cells (17, 17.1, 17.2, 13), 
and furthermore the end of the opening (20, 62) of the 
outlet passage (21, 61) lying remote from the point of 

deepest tooth engagement is located so close to the 
point (7) of deepest tooth engagement that between it 

and the point at which the displacement cells (17) 
start to diminish there is always more than one 

displacement cell (17, 17.1, 17.2), 
 
characterized in 


that in the region of diminishing displacement cells 
in the wall of the gear chamber (2) peripherally 

spaced from the opening (20, 62) of the outlet passage  
 

(21, 61) at least one orifice (30, 31, 70, 71) is 
located over which alternately displacement cells (17, 

17.1, 17.2) and teeth defining said cells pass, 
that the orifice (30, 31, 70, 71) is connected via a 
connecting passage (33, 73) to the outlet passage, and 
that the orifice (30, 31, 70, 71) on each passage of a 
tooth thereover is covered by said tooth completely or 

at least to a major degree, and 
that the orifice (30, 31, 70, 71) is formed as groove 
in the endwall (22) of the gear chamber (2) extending 

in the peripheral direction near the foot circle of 
the toothing of the pinion (4), or as is preferred, of 

the ring gear (3). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the orifice (30, 31, 70, 71) is small compared 

with the opening (20, 62) of the outlet passage (21, 
61) and the cross-section of the connecting passage 

(33, 73) is small compared with that of the outlet 
passage (21, 61). 
Internal gear pump according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the extent of the orifices (30, 31, 70, 

71) in the radial direction is one fifth to one third 
of the height of the teeth passing thereover. 
Internal gear pump according to any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the connecting passage (33, 

73) is formed as groove in the wall (22) of the gear 
chamber (2) covered by the body of the gear (3, 43) 

carrying the teeth passing thereover.  
 
Internal gear pump according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the connecting passage (33, 73) branches off 

radially from the orifice (30, 31, 70, 71). 
Internal gear pump having the tooth nunber difference 
one according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that the spacing of the orifice (30, 
31, 73) from the opening (20, 62) of the outlet passage 

(21, 61) in the peripheral direction is substantially 
equal to half the distance between the end of the 

opening of the inlet channel and the end of the opening 
of the outlet channel. 
Internal gear pump with the tooth number difference of 
more than one and comprising a filling piece (60) in the 

space between the head circles of the gears (43, 44) 
opposite the point of deepest tooth engagement according 

to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
spacing, measured in the delivery direction, of the 

orifice (70) from the pressure-side end of the filling 
piece (60) is substantially equal to zero. 
Internal gear pump according to one of the claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that in the case of a plurality of 

orifices (30, 31, 70, 71) arranged consecutively in the 
peripheral direction said orifices are spaced apart a 

distance of about half a tooth pitch.  
 
Internal gear pump according to claim 8, characterized 
in that the orifices (30, 31, 70, 71) are connected via 

a common connecting passage (33, 73) to the outlet 
opening (20, 62).

9, characterized in that it comprises a suction control 

having a fixed or variable throttle (14, 54) arranged 
in the inlet passage (12, 52). 
Internal gear pump according to one of the claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the extent of the orifice 

(30, 31, 70, 31) in the peripheral direction is 
substantially equal to the thickness of the teeth

11, characterized in that the distance of the orifice 

(31, 73) from the opening (20, 62) of the outlet
