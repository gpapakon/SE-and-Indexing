<ABSTRACT>
A discovery underlying this invention is the concordance between particular cellular signaling mechanisms and cancer cell growth and metastasis. It has now been discovered that certain compounds inhibit the signal transduction required for the maintenance and driving of the malignant process. These compounds are also effective for the in vivo treatment of solid tumors and related disease states. This invention provides a method for the use of these compounds to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of malignant solid tumors in mammals. This invention further provides a method for using related compounds to treat diseases involving aberrant signal transduction pathways. Some of the compounds used in the methods of the present invention are novel and constitute another aspect of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The development of new and more effective chemotherapeutic agents for
cancer treatment requires consideration of a variety of factors including cytotoxicity,
tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conventional anticancer agents have
typically been identified on the basis of their cytotoxicity alone, as the signaling
pathways required for the maintenance and driving of the malignant process were not
known. These pathways are now being elucidated in terms of signal transduction.Signal transduction is the processing of chemical signals from the cellular
environment through the cell membrane, and may occur through at least three distinct
mechanisms: phosphorylation, activation of ion channels, and effector enzyme activation
via guanine nucleotide binding protein intermediates.Linkage of selected signal transduction pathways to malignant behavior has
been demonstrated using molecular biologic techniques. Three different guanine
nucleotide-binding protein-linked receptors have been transfected into normal recipient
cells and upon specific ligand activation caused malignant behavior.Tumor formation and ligand-specific focus formation was found when the
serotonin 1c receptor was placed into NIH-3T3 cells and stimulated with a receptor
specific ligand. Julius, et al., Science,244:1057-1062 (1989). Serotonin stimulation of
the transfected 5HT1c receptors resulted in mobilization of calcium, leading to a
proposed link between receptor activation of the signal pathway and the biologic function
of tumor formation. A similar outcome was seen when an adrenergic alpha-1B receptor was put
into NIH-3T3 and Rat-1 cells. Allen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA88:11354-11358
(1991). In that experiment, catecholamine stimulation of the transfected receptor
produced foci formation and increased cellular proliferation in culture as well as
tumorigenic behavior in nude mice. Allen, et al. further demonstrated the functional
coupling of the transfected receptor to production of total inositol phosphates which can
secondarily cause internal release and influx of calcium, suggesting a link between these
signal transduction pathways and the malignant response.Lastly, transfection of the odd-numbered muscarinic receptors into NIH-3T3
cells has been shown to stimulate internal calcium release and uptake, arachidonic
acid release, and generation of inositol phosphates. See, Bonner, et al., Neuron, 1:403-410
