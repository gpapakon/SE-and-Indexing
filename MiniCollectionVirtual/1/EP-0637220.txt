<ABSTRACT>
An insertable intracavity probe (10) for use in magnetic resonance imaging of an area of interest in a relatively inaccessible region of the body is disclosed. The probe has an internal pickup coil (18) carried at the distal end of a shaft (12) for rectal insertion of the coil and an inflatable anti-migration cuff (72) to hold the probe in position and prevent outward migration thereof during a procedure. The anti-migration cuff (72) is carried on an outer sleeve (16) which is slidably and rotatably mounted on the shaft. The coil (18) is carried on a resilient tip structure (38) at the distal end of the shaft which is flexible in the plane normal to the plane of the coil. Deflection of the coil assembly is controlled by a pair of control lines (46 and 48) attached to the distal end of the tip structure. The lines may be selectively tensioned to deflect the coil in the direction of tension by a thumb wheel control (56) at the handle (26) of the probe.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENDORECTAL PROBE WITH PLANAR MOVEABLE MRI COILBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to a receiving device in the form of an intracavity probe for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy systems to enhance the imaging performance and spectroscopy sensitivity of such instruments when evaluating anatomical regions small in size relative to the body, and deep within the body, but proximate a location where an insertable pickup probe may be used. More particularly, the present invention relates to an intracavity pickup probe which is externally directable within the body cavity to allow for optimum placement of the probe relative to the intended target.In the field of MRI systems, also commonly known as NMR imaging systems, external pickup probes are typically used for receiving radio frequency signals from the anatomical region of interest. See, for example, copending, commonly assigned Application No. 07/771,419, filed October 7, 1991, titled "Probe for MRI Imaging and Spectroscopy Particularly in the Cervical Region" for a discussion of such probes. For optimum performance when imaging certain select parts of the body, the pickup probe should be insertable for intracavity use and include a radio frequency receiving coil to be positioned as close to the region of interest as possible. It is important, therefore, that a suitable MRI probe be provided which may be selectively and accurately positioned within the body cavity proximate the deep body target whose image is sought to be received by the pickup. 

The internal placement of the pickup, once inserted within the body cavity, must be capable of adjustment and control at the proximal end of the probe, outside the body.In order to manipulate the MRI probe within the body cavity, it is desirable to have a probe tip which is rotatable and deflectable, in order that the pickup coil may be rotated to the proper orientation within the body cavity, and positioned accurately and firmly against the target region. It is also desirable to be able to direct the probe toward the anatomical area of interest through a body cavity which may curve. It is desirable as well to be able to control the rotation and deflection of the probe tip, and therefore, its orientation, remotely, that is, outside the patient's body.Summary of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide an insertable intracavity pickup probe capable of being placed in close proximity to a region of interest to improve the quality of the magnetic

probe is inserted in a body cavity to prevent outward migration of the probe from the cavity.
4. A method of magnetic resonance imaging a region of interest internally of a patient comprising providing the insertable intracavity probe according to claim 1, inserting the balloon structure of the probe into a body cavity of a patient, using said deflecting means to facilitate navigation through the body cavity until the coil is proximate said region of interest, and inflating the internal balloon such that the peripheral channel is positioned adjacent said region of interest.
5. A probe as in claim 1 wherein said tip structure includes a resilient blade aligned substantially coplanarly with said pickup coil.
6. A probe as in claim 1 wherein the anatomical area of interest is the cervix.
7. A method as in claim 1 wherein said area of interest is the cervix and said body cavity is the rectum.
8. An insertable intracavity probe for use in magnetic resonance imaging of a region of interest within a body cavity comprising an elongate shaft having a proximal end, a distal end, a handle on the proximal end of the shaft, and a balloon structure on the distal end of the shaft, the balloon structure including an outer balloon, a pickup coil in the outer balloon 


lying in a plane, the probe further comprising an electrical lead for connecting the coil to an interface network, and means connected to the coil within the outer balloon for selectively deflecting the coil in a plane normal to the plane of the coil, wherein the balloon structure includes an elongate member having a substantially triangular cross section attached to said defecting means, and said coil is mounted to one side of said member.
