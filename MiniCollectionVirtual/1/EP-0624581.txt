<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to compounds of the formula 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used in formula I, and 
throughout the specification, the symbols have the following meanings:
 
   a, b and d are all carbon atoms or one of a, b and d is a 
nitrogen atom or -N(O)- and the others are carbon atoms;
 
   A is a single bond, -CH₂-, -O-, -S- or -N(R)- where R is 
hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkyl;
 
   R¹ is hydrogen, alkyl, halo, haloalkyl, nitro or cyano;
 
   R² is hydrogen, alkyl or halo;
 
   R³ is -COR, -CO-amino, -CO-substituted amino, 
-NRCOOR*, -NRCO-amino or -NRCO-substituted amino (where R* is the 
same or different R, as defined above);
 
   R⁴ is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl or 
(cycloalkyl)alkyl; or R³ and R⁴ together with the carbon and nitrogen atoms  
 
to which they are attached, form a fused imidazole ring, optionally 
substituted at an available carbon atom of the imidazole portion with one or 
more substituents selected from hydrogen, alkyl, cyano, -COR, -COOR, 
-CO-amino, -CO-substituted amino, -NRCOOR*, -NRCO-amino or 
-NRCO-substituted amino;
 
   R⁵ is hydrogen, hydroxy or -OC(O)R (R as defined above);
 
   R⁶ and R⁷ are each independently hydrogen, alkyl or 
arylalkyl, or R⁶ and R⁷ taken together with the carbon atom to which they 
are attached form a 5- to 7-membered carbocyclic ring;
 
   R⁸ is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, 
arylalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, -CN, -NO₂ -COR, -COOR, -CONHR, 
-CONR⁵, -CF₃, S-alkyl, -SOalkyl, -SO₂alkyl, 
halogen, amino, substituted amino, -O-alkyl, -OCF₃, 
-OCH₂CF₃, -OCOalkyl, -OCONRalkyl, -NRCOalkyl, -NRCOOalkyl or 
-NRCONR⁵;
 
   R⁹ is hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxy, -O-alkyl, amino, substituted 
amino, -NHCOR, -CN or -NO₂; and
 
   n is an integer of 1 to 3, provided that when a, b and d are 
carbon atoms, R³ is -NRCOOR* and R⁴ is hydrogen, that one of R¹ or R² 
is other than hydrogen. These compounds possess antiischemic activity and are useful, for 
example as cardiovascular agents. The present invention provides for compounds of formula I, 
pharmaceutical compositions employing such compounds and for methods 
of using such compounds. Listed below are definitions of various terms 
used to describe the compounds of the instant invention. These definitions 
apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless they 
are otherwise limited in specific instances either individually or as part of a 
larger group.  The
