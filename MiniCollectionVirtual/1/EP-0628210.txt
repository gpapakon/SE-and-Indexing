<ABSTRACT>
An encoding instrument (60, 96) held in substantially the palmar axis of a hand (10, 116) has a convexo-curved keypad surface (66, 102) accessibly equidistant to the thumb (14, 120) of the holding hand. The primary surface of the keypad (62, 98) is substantially not coincidental with a handle (64, 100). Encoding switches (68, 104, 138, 156) mounted on the keypad are connected by cable or wireless signal transmission to operate selected functions. A movement control device (70, 106, 140) mounted at the thumb end of the handle is operated by the thumb of the holding hand. Analog switch movement (82, 84; 111, 112) is positively and negatively manipulated by digit fingers (12, 88, 118) of the holding hand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of encoding
instruments, and more particularly to one-handed encoding, controller
and communication instruments.In the past, it has been known to provide encoding,
controller, and communication instruments designed to be held
by a single hand and having thereon a plurality of switching
elements, such as, for example, switch buttons. Such instruments
are usually connected in remote circuit with other units
such that there is switch signal transmitting interaction between
the instruments and such other units.Hereinafter, in this specification, the term "encoder",
or perhaps "encoding instrument", or "encoding device",
will be used generally to refer to such instruments, even
though the specific application may be for communications, such
as a cellular telephone set, or for a controller, such as a
remote controller for, e.g., a television set.One such device may be representatively seen in Letters
Patent No. 4,517,424, which shows an encoding instrument 
operated by short digital movements within an encircling frame.
Another representative example of such encoding instrument may
be seen in Letters Patent No. 4,620,287 having finger operated
switches mounted to an adjustable handle. See also the table
mounted one-hand encoding device shown in Letters Patent No.
4,260,892.In the past, it has also been known to use encoding
instruments designed to be grasped by a hand having switch or
switches operable by the thumb. A representative example of
such an instrument can be seen in Letters Patent No. 4,739,128
which shows an operating control stick, sometimes called a
"joystick," having multiple-position switches designed to be
operated by a thumb. Such thumb-operated encoding instruments
have only a limited number of switch positions or control options
which can be selected.Another known hand held control device 2 shown in WO-A-90/08392
has a handle portion extending in a generally longitudinal
direction and a keypad extension with control elements on a flat
or planar surface which extends in generally the same direction
as the longitudinally extending handle portion.In none of these devices is there shown a hand-held
encoding instrument described having control switches or buttons
positioned for "non-retraction" access by digits or thumb
with movements beginning from the digits' repose position.
Hereinafter in this Specification, the term "digit" will be
used to include the thumb of a hand unless otherwise specified,
but the term "finger" will be used to exclude the thumb

<CLAIMS>
A hand held encoding instrument comprising a keypad
(62) with a keypad surface (66) having a plurality of

manually operable switch means (68, 70) on said surface for
selectively switching circuit connections, and a handle (64)

connected to the keypad (62) and adapted to be grasped by
flexion of non-thumb fingers of a hand (10), the handle

extending in a longitudinal direction (122) substantially
co-incidental with a palmar grip axis (56) of a hand (10)

when grasping the handle by flexion of the non-thumb
fingers, said switch means (68, 70) on said keypad surface

(66) being accessible to a thumb (14) of an operator's hand
(10) grasping the handle (64), 
characterised in that
 said
keypad surface (66) is either substantially concavely curved

or substantially planar at an angle of less than 180Â° to said handle
longitudinal direction (122) to facilitate operation of the

switch means (68, 70) by the thumb of an operator's hand
when the non-thumb fingers of the latter grasp said handle

(64).
An instrument according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 it further comprises transmitting means (76, 90)
connected to said switch means (68, 70) for transmitting

signals over substantial distances in response to movement
of said switch means (68, 70).
An instrument according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 said keyboard surface (66) is
substantially concavely curved and has at least one radius

of curvature. 
An instrument according to Claim 3,
characterised in that said keypad surface (66) has an apex and a plane

tangential with said keypad surface and co-incidental with
said apex, and wherein the angle between said handle longitudinal

direction (122)
and said tangential plane at said apex is less than

180 degrees.
An instrument according to claim 3, characterised in that
the radius of curvature of said keypad surface

is defined by at least the radius defined by said keypad
surface and a metacarpal-phalangeal joint of the thumb of

said hand.
An instrument according to claim 3, characterised in that
the radius of curvature of said keypad surface is

defined by at least a combination of the radii defined (i)
by said keypad surface and a metacarpal-phalangeal joint

of the thumb of said hand, and (ii) by said keypad surface
and a saddle joint of said hand.
An instrument according to claim 6, characterised in that
the radius of curvature of said keypad surface is

defined further by, in combination, said keypad surface
and the inter-phalangeal joint of the thumb of said hand.
An instrument according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the instrument

further comprises at least one handle switch means (82, 84) for
selectively switching circuit connections and mounted on

said handle (64) grasped by said non-thumb fingers and positioned 
to be operatively engaged and switched by at least

one of said non-thumb fingers.
An instrument according to claim 8, characterised in that
said handle switch means (82, 84) comprises a progressive

analog switch adapted to be engaged by one of said
non-thumb fingers and moved in response to flexion and

moved in an opposite direction in response to extension of
said one non-thumb finger, said switch having a

selectively progressive engagement determined by the
movement of said one non-thumb finger.
An instrument according to claim 8, characterised in that
said handle switch means (82, 84) further comprises a

plurality of switches mounted on said handle, each of said
switches being adapted to be engaged and operated by

movement of a corresponding non-thumb finger.
An instrument according to any one of the preceding claim, characterised

in that said switch means comprises a prime mover switch (70) mounted on said
keypad (62) in a position adapted to be

contacted by a tip of a thumb of said hand when said hand
grasps said handle (64) and said thumb is in repose.
