<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analytical rotor for the
use with a centrifuge, the rotor comprising a rotor body having an axis
of rotation, a top layer, and a bottom layer, a receptacle on a layer of
the rotor body for receiving a post on the centrifuge and means in the
rotor body for releasing a liquid in response to mounting the rotor body
in the centrifuge, said liquid being held by a container sealed by a
seal.The invention further relates to a method of delivering a predetermined
volume of liquid from a container sealed by a seal to a receiving
chamber within an analytical rotor for the use with a centrifuge,
said rotor being provided with a chamber for inserting the container
and with a receptacle for inserting a post.Blood plasma and other biological tests frequently require
that predetermined volumes of liquids be quickly and completely mixed
with a biological fluid for analysis in a variety of optical tests or
assays. It is also desirable to separate potentially-interfering cellular
components of the material from the biological fluid prior to
testing. Such mixing and separation steps have heretofore been typically
performed by centrifugation to separate, for instance, blood plasma from
the cellular components, followed by manual or automated pipetting of
predetermined volumes of the blood plasma into separate test wells for
optical analysis. Such procedures are labor-intensive and time consuming,
and various automated systems and methods have been proposed for
providing multiple aliquots of plasma suitable for testing in a more efficient
manner.Prior art rotors have frequently utilized complex designs
which are difficult and costly to manufacture. Often, the rotors require
various separable parts or components which are brought together or separated
at different points in the centrifugation procedure. Previous
centrifugal rotors have often been limited in the number of discrete
samples and test wells which they can provide, and in some cases require
the use of a separate displacement fluid to effect flow of blood and
plasma through the system.For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide improved 
centrifugal rotors and methods suitable for quickly and easily delivering
a predetermined volume of liquid to a receiving chamber in the rotor.
The methods should be simple and be capable of being performed in
relatively short times. In particular, the methods should require relatively
few steps and should be capable of being performed with little or
no intervention or manipulation by the

An analytical rotor for the use with a centrifuge, the rotor
comprising a rotor body (2) having an axis of rotation, a top layer

(56), and a bottom layer (4), a receptacle (60) on a layer of the rotor
body (2) for receiving a post (58, 76) on the centrifuge and means in

the rotor body (2) for releasing a liquid in response to mounting the

(52) is a foil seal held in place by restraining posts (75) and in that

the container (62) comprises a rigid side (72) having a scribe mark (74)
along which the container (62) is capable of being opened in response to

the insertion of the post (76) into the receptacle (60).
