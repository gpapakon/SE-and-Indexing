<ABSTRACT>
A control system for an internal combustion 
engine (l) corrects an amount of supply fuel to the 

engine (l) based upon operating conditions of the 
engine (l) as well as an estimated amount of adherent 

fuel adhering to the inner surface of the intake 
passage (2) and an estimated amount of fuel carried off 

from fuel adhering to the intake passage (2) inner 
surface and carried into combustion chambers. 

According to the invention, the adherent fuel amount 
and the carried-off fuel amount are corrected based 

upon a calculated amount of exhaust gases (recirculated 
by recirculation means 20) and a detected operating 

mode or valve timing (changeable from low to high speed 
valve timing by means l9) of at least one of intake 

valves and exhaust valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system for
internal combustion engines, and more particularly to a
control system which controls the supply of fuel
injected into an intake pipe in a manner compensating
for a fuel amount adhering to the inner surface of the
intake pipe.In conventional internal combustion engines of
the type that fuel is injected into an intake pipe,
there is a problem that some of injected fuel adheres
to the inner surface of the intake pipe, so that a
required amount of fuel cannot be drawn into the
combustion chamber resulting in a difficulty of
accurately controlling the air-fuel ratio of a mixture
supplied to the engine. To solve this problem, there
has been proposed a fuel supply control method which
estimates a fuel amount which is to adhere to the inner
surface of the intake pipe and one which is to be drawn
into the combustion chamber by evaporation from the
fuel adhering to the intake pipe, and determines a fuel
injection amount in dependence on the estimated fuel
amounts (Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 61-126337).To improve this fuel supply control method, a
supply fuel amount correction method has been proposed
by the assignee of the present application, which
calculates a fuel amount adhering to the inner surface
of the intake pipe by the use of coefficients Ae and Be
which are obtained by correcting a direct supply ratio
(the ratio of a fuel amount injected into the intake
pipe and directly drawn into the combustion chamber to
the whole amount of fuel injected into the intake pipe)
and a carry-off ratio (the ratio of a fuel amount
carried off the inner surface of the intake pipe and
drawn into the combustion chambers to the amount of 
fuel adhering to the inner surface), in dependence on
the rotational speed of the engine, etc., the two
ratios being determined based upon the temperature of
engine coolant and pressure within the intake pipe, and
corrects the fuel amount to be supplied to the
combustion chamber by the use of the amount of fuel
adhering to the inner surface and the coefficients Ae,
Be (Japanese Patent Application No. 3-283694, and
corresponding U. S. Serial No. 07/945,489 filed
September 16, 1992) (Prior Art A).Further, in internal combustion engines
equipped with exhaust gas recirculation systems, it has
been conventionally known to correct the supply fuel
amount during operation of the exhaust gas
recirculation system. Usually, an exhaust gas
recirculation system has a recirculation control valve
arranged across an exhaust gas
