<ABSTRACT>
A method for fermentation of especially highly viscous substrate is carried through with a controlled mixing of air. The addition of air takes place in two steps, where in the first step a small amount of substrate is mixed with a larger amount of air such that a foam containing air bubbles is formed. In the second step the foam is distributed and mixed into the substrate in a mixing zone, at which very small air bubbles are formed. The rising speed of the bubbles is so low that the degree of utilization of oxygen in the added air is above 20 %. An arrangement for addition of air in highly viscous substrate comprises a tube (1) for addition of air to a rotating foam forming means (2) which is submerged in the substrate in a fermentation tank. The means comprises two elements where at least one of the elements has a side with a structure with lowered and/or raised parts. The elements are arranged to be movable in a transversal way in relation to each other with a mutual distance corresponding to the desired size of the liquid lamella. The spaces which are present in the lowered parts in the structure are connected to the tube for addition of air and surrounding substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for fermentation
of especially highly viscous substrate in a fermentation
tank with a controlled mixing of air and an
arrangement for mixing air into the substrate.It is necessary to supply air to the fermentation tank
in order to make the microorganisms grow in aerobic
fermentations. Such arrangements for supply of air may
be designed in many ways. One known arrangement for
supply of air consists of a tube coil provided with
holes which is arranged close to the bottom of the
fermentation tank. The curtain of air bubbles which is
formed is then distributed in the tank by means of a
mixer of turbine type.Air addition must take place also when waste liquids are
purified biologically. In this connection surface
aerators as well as different kinds of submerged
aeration arrangements are used. In SE 351 198 there is
described an arrangement comprising an impeller and an
unperforated tube for addition of gas which tube leads
to the vicinity of the impeller boss.When this kind of aerator is used the liquid flows
through a distinct aeration zone, where the air is
powerfully mixed with the liquid. The mixture of air and
liquid then flows towards the surface. The liquid which
passes the aeration zone is saturated with oxygen, but
it is only a smaller part of the liquid in the fermentation
tank which passes the aeration arrangement. In the
tank there are consequently partial volumes which are 
saturated with oxygen and partial volumes which miss oxygen. It is very energy
demanding to dimension the capacity for mixing in such way that the whole volume
in the tank is brought to flow past the aeration arrangement.DE-A-2449212 and DE-B-2250827 also describe arrangements with rotary
impellers mounted at the lower ends of tubes, in both cases the foam which collects
at surface of the liquid becomes drawn down through the tube with the air for
further mixing with the liquid by the action of the impeller. JP-A-62023499
discloses an arrangement in which air is introduced by a diffusion device and the
foam produced rises through a draft tube.In industrial fermentations with uniform cell cultures there are many
possibilities to control the fermentation. In spontaneous fermentations or wild
fermentations as biological purification of waste water or liquid composting control
of the addition of oxygen is one of few possible control methods. The present
invention aims to provide a method and apparatus enabling more effective addition
of oxygen in a fermentation process.According to the
