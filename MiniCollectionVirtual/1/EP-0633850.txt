A pneumatic booster with electromagnetic servo control, 
especially for motor vehicle brake systems, comprising 


a booster casing (10) inside which a first chamber (12) and 
a second chamber (14) are separated from each other by a 

movable wall (16), 
a valve housing (22) which is connected to the movable wall 
(16) for joint axial relative movement with respect to the 

booster casing (10) and which includes a first valve seat 
(24), 
a sealing member (60) which is arranged to be axially 
movable inside the valve housing (22) and is biased in a 

direction towards the first valve seat (24), 
a piston (42) which is guided in the valve housing (22) so 
as to be axially displaceable and designed to transmit actuating 

forces from an actuator member (44) to an output member 
(50), 
a valve closing member (30) which is guided in the valve 
housing (22) so as to be axially displaceable with respect to 

the piston (42) and has a second valve seat (32) for cooperation 
with the sealing member (60), 
an abutment member (52) which projects to the outside substantially 
radially through a recess (36) formed in the valve 

housing (22) and defines an inoperative position of the piston 
(42) with respect to the booster casing (10) by abutting 

against a stop (54) formed at the booster casing (10), when 
the actuator member (44) is not actuated, 
a valve spring (38) which biases the valve closing member 
(30) in the direction of the sealing member (60), and 
an electromagnet (40) which, when energized, moves the 
valve closing member (30) away from the sealing member (60) 

against the resistance of the valve spring (38),
characterized
 in that the abutment member (52) is connected 
firmly to the piston (42) and received in the recess (36) of 

the valve housing (22) and in a corresponding radial recess 
(34) of the valve closing member (30) with an axial clearance  

 
of such dimensions that the valve spring (38) holds the valve 

closing member (30) against the abutment member (52) when the 
electromagnet (40) is not energized, simultaneously holding 

the second valve seat (32) against the sealing member (60) 
when the piston (42) is in its inoperative position. 
The booster as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the recess (34) in the valve closing member (30) is dimensioned 

such that the abutment member (52) is loaded by almost the 
entire force of the valve spring (38), in the joint position 

of rest of the valve closing mebmer (30) and the piston (42), 
while the sealing member (60) is loaded only by a minor residual 

force of the valve spring (38). 
The booster as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
the sealing member (60) is loaded by a spring (62) which counteracts 

the valve spring (38) and is weaker than the valve 
spring (38). 
The booster as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the valve closing member (30) is sealed 

off against the piston (42) in an area between the second 
valve seat (32) and the recess (34) formed in the valve closing 

member (30) by a seal (56) whose effective sealing diameter 
corresponds at least approximately to the effective diameter 

of the second valve seat (32). 
The booster as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the electromagnet (40) is installed in 

the valve housing (22) and the valve closing member (30) is 
designed as a magnetic armature. 
The booster as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the electromagnet (40) is enclosed by an annular space (68) 

which is part of a passage (28) controlled by the valve seats 
(24, 32) and the sealing member (60).  

 
The booster as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the valve spring (38) is disposed between the piston (42) 

and an extension (66) of the valve closing member (30) which 
extension is surrounded annularly by the sealing member (60).
