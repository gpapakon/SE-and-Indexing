<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR INDUCING TUMOR IMMUNITYBackground of the Invention This invention relates to methods and reagents for enhancing in vivo tumor cell immunity.(The following is a general discussion of relevant art and not an admission that any is prior art to the claimed invention. All of the cited or referenced art is hereby incorported by reference.) •In general, tumors that arise de novo are poorly immunogenic, thereby escaping host antitumor responses (Hewitt et al., 33 Br. J. Cancer 241, 1976). The reasons for this poor immunogenicity are poorly understood. A major objective in the field of tumor immunotherapy is the development of strategies for enhancing tumor immunogenicity, with potential applications in both tumor prevention and cure.•Several experimental strategies have been reported for enhancing tumor immunogenicity, for example, use of mutagen or drug treatment (Van Pel and Boon, 79 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 4718, 1982; Frost et al., 159 J____ Ex . Med♦ 1491, 1984; and Frost et al. , Maloy and Nicolson (eds.), in "Occult Nodal Metastasis in Solid Carcinoma", Cancer Research Monographs, Vol. 5, New York, Praeger Publishers, 1987) ; by transfection with a foreign gene encoding an exogenous antigen such as influenza hemagglutinin (Fearon et al. , 38 Cancer Research 2975, 1988) ; by transferring a gene expressing interleukin-2 (Fearon et al., 60 Cell 397, 1990); and by transferring a gene expressing interleukin-4 into a tumor (Tepper et al., 57 Cell 503, 1989, and Golu bek et al., 254 Science 713, 1991) . 

 The role of cytokines and growth factors in tumor cell growth has been discussed in the literature. See, for example, Walsh et al. , 155 Western Journal of Medicine 152, 1991; Foekens et al. , 63 Cancer 2139, 1989; oenuma et al., 80 Japanese Journal of Cancer Research 51, 1989; Antoniades et al. , FASEB Journal Abstracts 4716, 1991; Aaronson, 254 Science 1146, X991; Macaulay et al. , 50 Cancer Research 2511, 1990; Korc-Grodzicki et al», Eighty-Second American Association for Cancer Research Proceedings Vol. 32, Abstract 300, 1991; Culouscou et al. , 40 International Journal of Cancer 646, 1987; Roholl et al., 16 Histopathology 455, 1990; Estrov et al. , 9 Journal Clinical Oncology 394, 1991; Rodeck et al. , 97 Journal Investigative Dermatology 20, 1991; and Theodorescu et al. , 148 Journal of Cellular Physiology 380, 1991. Others have suggested a relationship between receptors for such cytokines and tumorigenicity. See, for example, Noguchi et al., 82 Japanese Journal of Cancer Research 1199,
