<ABSTRACT>
A plasma mass spectrometer has a plasma ion source (1). The source has associated 
with it an electromagnetic excitation means (2), which may be one or more induction 

coils. The excitation means is powered by an RF generator (3). Ions are sampled from 
the plasma ion source through an interface (15) into a vacuum chamber (16). The 

stream of ions is directed by an ion optics element (4) through a mass analyser (5) to 
an ion detector (6). 
The excitation means may include means (7) for altering the axial component of the 
electromagnetic field sustaining the plasma. Alternatively or additionally, the 

spectrometer may include signal detecting means (11,17) to provide feedback enabling 
optimisation of parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to the adjusting of a
plasma mass spectrometer. It relates particularly but not
exclusively to an improved adjustment mechanism for a
plasma ion source and to a feedback mechanism allowing fine
tuning of plasma parameters.The most commonly used type of plasma mass
spectrometer is an inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometer. Other types include the glow discharge plasma
mass spectrometer and the microwave induced plasma mass
spectrometer. The improvements described in this
specification relate
to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers.A plasma mass spectrometer comprises a plasma ion
source, an interface, at least one ion optics element for
directing a stream of ions, a mass analyser and an ion
detector. The plasma ion source for an inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometer normally comprises an argon
plasma, into which the sample to be analysed is introduced.
A radio frequency (RF) induction means having one or more
coils surrounds the argon plasma and sustains the plasma.
In a microwave plasma mass spectrometer the plasma is
sustained by microwave radiation, and in a glow discharge
plasma mass spectrometer the plasma is created by the
effect of electrical discharge on a solid which is to be
analysed. Particles from the plasma are typically extracted
into a vacuum chamber through one or more orifices in a
plasma/mass spectrometer interface, and the stream of
ionized particles thus created is directed through the
vacuum chamber by means of ion optics lenses and a mass
filter to an ion detector.In the operation of plasma mass spectrometers, a
frequently desired objective is that the ratio of signal to
background noise measured at the ion detector be maximized.
In order to improve the quality of measurements, it is
necessary to reduce the relative amount of background 
noise. A different objective which is sometimes desired is
the maximization of the net signal level of ions. Another
objective is minimization of ions arising from molecular
species; another objective is control of the level of ions
carrying multiple positive charges rather than the usual
single positive charge. Various known plasma parameters can
be adjusted to achieve these objectives.One such parameter which can be adjusted is the
location of the plasma ion source relative to the interface
orifices. Slight changes in location may result in
substantial changes in analyte ion flux through the
orifices.Another parameter which can be adjusted is the rate of
flow of the gas carrying the sample to be
