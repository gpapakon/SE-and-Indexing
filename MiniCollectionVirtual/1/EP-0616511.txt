A guide device for a drill for making the hole, 
extending substantially perpendicularly to a medullary nail 

inserted in the femur, for the insertion of a femur neck 
screw, comprising a drilling template (5) detachably 

connectable to the proximal end (2) of the medullary nail 
(1), said drilling template (5) comprising at least two 

drilling holes (3, 4), characterised in that the drilling 
template may pivot about a horizontal axis (A - A) extending 

perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the medullary 
nail (1) and perpendicularly to the orientation of the femur 

neck and is vertically adjustable in parallel with the 
longitudinal axis of the medullary nail (1), and in that the 

drilling holes are at a horizontal distance (a) from each 
other corresponding at least to the diameter of the medullary 

nail (1), said horizontal distance being oriented 
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the medullary 

nail (1) and perpendicularly to the orientation of the femur 
neck. 
A guide device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the drilling template (5) is in block format and the 

drilling holes (3, 4; 3a, 4a) are inclined with respect to 
the horizontal oriented perpendicularly to the longitudinal 

axis of the medullary nail (1) and extending in parallel with 
the orientation of the femur neck, said inclination 

corresponding to the angle of connection of the femur neck to 
the femur bone. 
A guide device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised by a crossbeam which may be attached to the 

proximal end of the medullary nail (1) so as to be rotatable  
 

about the longitudinal axis of the medullary nail (1) and to 
whose free end there is connected in parallel the drilling 

template (5), which is height adjustable along the 
longitudinal axis of the medullary nail (1). 
A guide device according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the drilling template (5) is connected to the crossbeam 

(6) so as to be swivellable about a horizontal axis (A - A) 
perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the medullary 

nail (1) and perpendicularly to the orientation of the femur 
neck. 
A guide device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a plurality of drilling holes 

(3, 3a and 4, 4a) are arranged one below the other in the 
vertical direction and in parallel with the longitudinal axis 

of the medullary nail (1). 
A guide device according to any one of preceding 
claims 3 to 5, characterised by a thread at one end of the 

crossbeam (6), which may be screwed into a threaded 
connection (8) at the proximal end of the medullary nail (1). 
A guide device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the axes (x and y) of the 

drilling holes (3, 4; 3a, 4a) perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the medullary nail (1) and in the 

direction of orientation of the femur neck coincide in such a 
way that these axes meet behind the head of the femur 

(Fig. 2).
