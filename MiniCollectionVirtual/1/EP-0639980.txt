<ABSTRACT>
A method of accelerating corneal wound healing and/or improving the quality of wound healing in a mammal comprises: (1) providing an ophthalmically compatible solution of platelet-derived growth factor; and (2) applying the solution to the cornea of a mammal at the time of or subsequent to occurrence of a corneal wound in a quantity sufficient to accelerate clinically detectable healing, the healing being accelerated through proliferation of epithelial cells and/or keratocytes of the cornea stimulated by application of the platelet-derived growth factor to the cornea. The method also improves the quality of wound healing. The platelet-derived growth factor can be selected from the group consisting of the AA isoform, the AB isoform, the BB isoform, and mixtures thereof. A preferable form of platelet-derived growth factor is a recombinantly-derived refolded B-chain homodimer of 119 amino acids, having the amino acid sequence of S-L-G-S-L-T-I-A-E-P-A-M-I-A-E-C-K-T-R-T-E-V-F-E-I-S-R-R-L-I-D-R-T-N-A- N-F-L-V-W-P-P-C-V-E-V-Q-R-C-S-G-C-C-N-N-R-N-V-Q-C-R-P-T-Q-V-Q-L-R-P-V- Q-V-R-K-I-E-I-V-R-K-K-P-I-F-K-K-A-T-V-T-L-E-D-H-L-A-C-K-C-E-T-V-A-A-A- R-P-V-T-R-S-P-G-G-S-Q-E-Q-R. The concentration of platelet-derived growth factor in the solution can be from about 10  mu g/ml to about 1000  mu g/ml, preferably from about 50  mu g/ml to about 500  mu g/ml, and most preferably about 100  mu g/ml. The invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions for application to the cornea of a mammal for accelerating corneal wound healing and/or improving the quality of wound healing and tablets for preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF PLATELET DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR IN OPHTHALMIC WOUND HEALINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to the use' of platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF) to stimulate ophthalmic wound healing, particularly wounds to the cornea.Corneal wounds frequently arise from trauma t the eye, such as may occur in automobile accidents, industrial accidents, and wounds caused by weapons. Wounds to the eye also occur as the unavoidable consequence of surgery, such as cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty, glaucoma filtering surgery, retinal surgery such as retinal reattachiiient, and refractive surgery such as laser corneal ablation or radial keratotomy. Non-healing corneal ulcers may also arise from pathological non-traumatic causes, such as diabetes.The healing of these wounds can frequently be slow and difficult, complicating recovery from trauma o the post-operative course of surgery. There is, therefore, a need for a readily applicable method of accelerating ophthalmic wound healing, particularly of corneal wounds.Additionally, the quality of healing of corne wounds is frequently poor, leading to scarring and othe vision-impairing consequences. Therefore, there also i 

 a need for a method that can improve the quality of healing of corneal wounds.Recently, much attention has been paid to the use of growth factors to accelerate wound healing, particularly of skin. Growth factors are agents which cause cells to migrate, differentiate, transform, or mature and divide. These factors are polypeptides which can usually be isolated from many different normal and malignant mammalian cell types. Some growth factors can be produced by genetically-engineered microorganisms such as bacteria fEscherichia coli) and yeasts. See, for example. Chapters 10 and 11 of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair (1986) , incorporated herein by reference. Among these growth factors are included epidermal growth factor (EGF) , transforming growth factors alpha and beta (TGFα, TGF/3,, and TGF32) , fibroblast growth factor (FGF) , insulin-like growth factor (IGF) , nerve growth factor (NGF) , and platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF) . These are describe in U.S. Patent No. 4,939,135" o Robertson et al. , incorporated herein by this reference.The use of PDGF to accelerate wound healing in skin and connective tissue has been studied (Antoniades et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:565-569 (1991); Cromack et al. , . Trauma 30:S129-133 (1990); Ross et al., Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. fBiol.V 327:155-169 (1990) ) .
