<ABSTRACT>
Lever, particularly usable in ski boots of the type 
including a shell (2) with which at least one quarter (4) is 

associated, including a freely movable lever arm (6) and a 
support (7) which is associated with the quarter. The lever 

arm and the support have at least one seat for guiding at 
least two cables which are connected, at their ends, 

respectively to the quarter or to the shell and to the 
support. The two traction elements connect the lever arm to 

the support in a hinge-like manner, so as to give the lever 
arm the required orientation in open condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lever, particularly
usable in ski boots, as defined in the preamble of claim 1
and known, for example, from FR-A-2 577 118.Currently, in ski boots it is known to use many types
of lever for applying tension to traction elements, such as
cables or bands, that allow for example to secure the flaps
of a quarter or of a shell.Conventional levers are usually constituted by a lever
arm which is pivoted, at one end, at a pair of shoulders
protruding from a base which is in turn rigidly coupled at
the shell or at the quarter.These conventional levers have drawbacks: since the
lever arm is subject to accidental impacts during sports
practice and especially during breaks, when one walks with
the boot open and thus with the lever arm raised,
deformations are imparted to the shoulders of the base as a
consequence of these impacts; consequently the need arises
to replace the entire lever-base assembly.Furthermore, the use of a base entails additional costs
due both to the component and to the production step
required to couple it to the quarter or to the shell and to
pivot it to the lever arm.French patent no. 2,450,575 is known as a partial
solution to these drawbacks; it discloses a lever device for
locking and/or securing a ski boot, which has multiple
profiles that form a rack and are orientated along the
longitudinal axis. The profiles are arranged between two
retention bars which have longitudinal openings at which a
cable is passed; said cable can be manually made to interact
at the required point of the rack. One end of the lever arm can be arranged at a desired
point formed to the rear of the quarter.Although this solution eliminates the use of a base
with its associated shoulders for the pivoting of the lever
arm, drawbacks are still observed: in fact, once the skier
has opened the lever arm, thus disengaging it from the
quarter, said lever arm dangles to the rear of the boot and
can assume random positions due to the loosening of the
cable.Thus, on one hand the lever arm interacts with the
ground, for example while walking, so that the risk of
impact and breakage is not fully eliminated; on the other
hand its random arrangement can make the skier tend to close
it in an incorrect position or can force him to otherwise
restore the correct position for said lever, all this
constituting an undoubtedly awkward operation, since it
forces the skier to visually check an element located to the
rear of the boot.Furthermore, the cable must be arranged at the rack
manually by the

<CLAIMS>
Lever, particularly for ski boots that comprise a
shell (2) with which at least one quarter (3,4) is

associated, comprising a freely movable lever arm (6) and a
support (7) which is associated with said at least one

quarter (4), said lever arm and said support having at least
one seat (13) for guiding a traction element (24,25;124,125), characterized

in that it comprises at least two traction elements
(24,25;124,125) which are interconnected to said lever arm

(6) and, at their ends, to said support (7) and to said
shell (2) or quarter (3,4) such as to provide a selected

opening and closing movement of said at least one quarter
depending upon a selected position of said lever arm and

such as to connect said lever arm (6) to said support (7) in
a hinge-like manner. 
Lever according to claim 1, characterized in that
the lever arm (6) is constituted by a body

which is freely movable and distinct with respect to said
support (7) which is associated with said at least one

quarter, in a region adjacent to the upper perimetric edge
of said quarter.
Lever according to claim 2, characterized in that
said lever arm (6) is constituted by a body which has a

first freely movable end (9) that can be gripped by the user
and a second end (10) which is rounded or shaped like an

inclined plane which delimits an obtuse angle together with
the base (11), assigning a positive value to

counterclockwise rotation.
Lever according to claim 3, characterized in that
said second end can be arranged adjacent to a

complementarily shaped third end (12) of said support (7), a
first seat (13) being formed axially with respect to said

lever arm, starting from said second end, said first seat 
being connected, proximate to said first end, to a second

annular seat (14) which acts as a guide and is in turn
connected to a third seat (15) and to a fourth seat (16)

which are formed laterally to said first seat, within the
body of said lever arm.
Lever according to claim 4, characterized in that
said third and fourth seats are connected, through a pair of

first openings (17a,17b), to the upper surface (18) of said
lever arm which is opposite to said base.
Lever according to claim 5, characterized in that a
pair of second openings (19a,19b) is formed at said first

openings along the same axis and at said third end of said
support, said second openings affecting a pair of

longitudinal protrusions (20a,20b) that protrude above said
support on the side opposite to the surface that interacts

with said at least one quarter.
Lever according to claim 6, characterized in that
said pair of second openings is connected to a pair of fifth

seats (21a,21b) formed axially with respect to said pair of
longitudinal protrusions.
Lever according to claim 7, characterized in that a
sixth seat (22) is formed between said pair of protrusions

(20a,20b) and has the same axis as said first seat formed on
said lever arm, said sixth seat being connected to said

quarter (4), through a pair of adapted guides (23a,23b)
formed below said pair of longitudinal protrusions and

generally below said support.
Lever according to claim 8, characterized in that it
comprises a first traction element (24) and a second

traction element (25) which are constituted by a first and a 
second cables which have a fourth end (26a,26b) connected to

said at least one quarter or to said shell.
Lever according to claim 9, characterized in that,
starting from said fourth end, said first and second

traction elements affect said pair of guides, arranging
themselves at said sixth seat formed on said support and

then at said first seat formed on said lever arm.
Lever according to claim 10, characterized in that,
starting from said first seat, said first and second

traction elements are guided at said second annular seat and
subsequently pass respectively at said third and fourth

seats formed on the body of said lever arm and then exit
through said pair of first openings outside said lever arm

and said support and then re-enter, through said pair of
second openings, said pair of fifth seats formed on said

pair of longitudinal protrusions that protrude from said
support.
Lever according to claim 11, characterized in that
the fifth ends of said first and second traction elements

respectively are associated within said pair of fifth seats.
Lever according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the passage of said first and

second traction elements between said pair of first and
second openings formed on said lever arm and on said support

allows said hinge-like connection between said lever arm and said
support.
Lever, according to claim 1, characterized in that
it comprises a first traction element (124) and a second
