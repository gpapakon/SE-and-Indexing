<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held compact diagnostic device (14) is provided 
with a pair of instrument heads (26,28) each requiring an independent 

source of illumination. The instrument heads may 
be rotated into a fully extended position and once therein, 

may be smoothly turned through 360 degrees in consecutive 
ninety degree intervals to accommodate any preferred 

orientation desired by the user. Each instrument head is 
biased in the fully extended position and a rotated closed 

position. Each instrument head is also adjustably biased 
to an aligned position for proper closure by the interaction 

of an adjustment collar (86) with a pair of ball detents (64). 
The adjustment collar further biases each head in three 

additional positions at ninety degree intervals for use 
when fully extended. A pair of central terminals maintain 

continuous contact between each rotatable head (31) of the 
device while a pair of radial terminals (52,54) are in electrical 

contact only when the instrument head is in a fully 
extended position. When the instrument head is rotated 

into the closed position, the radial terminals disengage 
to open the circuit between the source of illumination in 

the instrument head and a battery source contained within 
the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to portable or hand-held 
medical diagnostic devices and, in particular, to a 
compact device having an adjustable adaptor for accommodating 
a variety of different heads. More specifically, 
but without restriction to the particular embodiment 
hereinafter shown and described, this invention relates to 
a compact device having a pair of instrument heads which 
are independently extendable and, once extended, smoothly 
turnable through 360 degrees in consecutive ninety degree 
increments. The art of hand-held compact diagnostic devices has 
been contributed to by a number of proposed devices 
including, for example, the handle-case disclosed in 
United States Patent No. 3,812,847 which issued to W.C. 
Moore et al. May 28, 1974. These devices are conveniently 
carried by doctors and practitioners periodically or 
throughout the entire work day, thus making them readily 
available when needed. The Moore et al. device includes a pair of illuminated 
medical instrument heads which are each permanently 
secured to a corresponding base contained in the handle-case. 
When the case is opened, the base allows the 
instrument head to be folded out with a predetermined 
orientation. Once the instrument is folded out, it is 
positionable in any one of six possible orientations 
relative to the handle-case. The six orientations include 
the predetermined orientation which is required to fold 
the instrument into the case and properly close the cover 
thereover. In other prior devices wherein the instrument head 
is releasable from the base, the predetermined orientation  
 
aligned for proper closure requires precise and costly 
machining to time the threads on the base to those provided 
in the neck of the instrument head so that when the 
instrument is tightly screwed to the base, the head 
obtains the desired predetermined orientation. It is only 
with this predetermined orientation that the cover may be 
properly closed against the case. Since the typical 
instrument head has an irregular shape, folding the 
instrument into the case with any other orientation would 
result in a portion of the instrument projecting out of 
the case thus interfering with the cover and preventing 
proper closure. The precise machining required to give 
the instrument head the desired orientation serves as an 
impediment to providing the device with optional instrument 
heads. This is true because of manufacturing 
difficulties encountered in providing a new instrument 
head having a different
