<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is the use of stellite 
material for all contact surfaces between moving parts 

and a metering pump pumping silver photographic emulsion. 
All parts that are in contact with the solutions 

containing silver made of stellite will prevent failure 
of rotating assemblies due to metallic silver plateout 

between rotating parts. Prior art pumps exhibited silver 
plateout after very few hours of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of 
pumps for delivering silver photographic emulsions. More 
specifically, the present invention is a pump which 
prevents silver plateout of silver photographic 
emulsions. A major problem with existing metering pumps 
when delivering silver photographic emulsions is the 
failure of the metering pumps due to seizing from silver 
plateout between the rotating parts. This failure 
necessitates interrupting coating events to replace 
seized pumps or scheduling frequent pump changes to 
reduce unscheduled interruptions which also involves 
production shut down. All commercially available 
metering pumps are made of stainless steel or other 
alloys which have a problem with silver plateout. In U.S. Patents 4,318,672 and 3,576,377, the 
use of stellite, a cobalt-based metal, has been shown to 
improve wear resistance and abrasion resistance in blade 
fans and turbines. Likewise, in U.S. patent 4,443,152 
the use of stellite for the blades of an axial slurry 
pump to improve abrasion resistance is suggested. 
Finally, in U.S. patent 4,475,866 the use of stellite and 
a liquid metal mechanical pump to improve wear resistance 
is also taught. However, the use of stellite to prevent 
silver plateout in a photographic emulsion processing 
pump is not suggested by these references. The present invention solves the problem of 
silver plateout in silver photographic emulsion 
processing pumps. This is accomplished by providing a 
pump for pumping silver halide containing fluid 
compositions wherein all parts of the pumps in direct  
 
contact with the silver halide composition have a 
stellite surface. The present invention is a method and apparatus 
for eliminating silver plateout from silver photographic 
emulsions. The method includes subjecting the 
photographic emulsion to shear by pumping the 
photographic emulsion through a pump which has been made 
from stellite such that the silver in the photographic 
emulsion which contacts the pump surfaces do not plateout 
silver. All surfaces of the pump in direct contact with 
the silver halide containing fluid composition and the 
surfaces in frictional contact with each other are made 
of stellite. The apparatus of the present invention is a 
pump which includes a pump housing made of stellite, a 
rotatable drive shaft made of stellite axially positioned 
through said housing, a stationary drive shaft made of 
stellite axially positioned through said housing, pump 
gears made of stellite fixedly secured to said rotatable 
sha
