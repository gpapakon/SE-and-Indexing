An electric switch comprising a switching mechanism including at least two 
contact pieces (17), which are disposed in a housing (1), from which terminals 

(4) extend, which are connected to the contact pieces (17), and comprising 
actuating means for at least one of the contact pieces (17), which is mounted 

on a contact spring (5, 10), wherein the housing (1) consists of a base (2) and 
a cap (3), which is adapted to be closed by the base (2), and at least the terminal 

(4) for the contact piece (17) which is to be actuated extends out 
through and is sealed to the base (2) and at least the contact spring (5, 10) 

extends into the cap (3) in such an arrangement that the contact spring (5) is 
adapted to be deflected by a pivotal movement of the cap (3),
characterised in
 that the cap (3) when it is in its closed position is adapted to 
be pulled from the base (2) to a position for use in which the cap (3) is pivoted 

to the base (2). 
A switch according to claim 1, 
characterised in
 that two pins (6) are provided 
on the base (2) and the cap (3) is pivoted to said pins (6). 
A switch according to claim 2, 
characterised in
 that the cap (3) is provided at 
its open end with two mutually opposite extensions (7), each extension (7) is 

formed with an aperture (8) for receiving one of the pins (6), each aperture (8) 
has two portions, which are separated by a waist (9) and serve to receive the 

associated pin (6), and the width of the waist (9) is smaller than the diameter 
of the pin. 
A switch according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
 that each 
contact piece (11) is mounted on a contact spring (5, 10).  

 
A switch according to claim 4, 
characterised in
 that a third contact spring is 
arranged between two mutually opposite contact springs (5, 10) and the cap 

(3) deflects one of the two outer contact springs (5) as the cap (3) is pivotally 
moved in one direction and the other (10) of the two outer contact springs (5) 

as the cap (3) is pivotally moved in the other direction. 
A switch according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
 that a 
stop (13) for the respective contact spring (5, 10) to be deflected is provided 

in the cap (3). 
A switch according to claim 6, 
characterised in
 that the stop (13) is 
adjustable. 
A switch according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
 that the 
cap (1) is a loose part and can entirely be pulled from the base (2). 
A switch according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
 that for 
its actuation the cap (3) is pivotally movable in two directions form a position 

of rest and in doing so carries different contact springs (5, 10) along.
