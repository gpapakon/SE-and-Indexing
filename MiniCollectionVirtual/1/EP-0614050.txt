<ABSTRACT>
Heater having a burner which is supplied from a pipe for forming the gas mixture and upstream of which there is arranged a fan (blower) on the input side and which is assigned a gas feed pipe which projects through an air inlet into the pipe for forming the gas mixture and in which there is arranged a pressure measuring point which is intended for detecting the pressure of the mixture and is connected via a measurement channel to a gas fitting which controls a gas pressure control valve. The fan and a combustion chamber surrounding the burner are arranged in a low-pressure chamber provided with a feed opening for the fresh air. In order in the case of such a heater to detect an abnormal operating condition quickly, it is provided to arrange on the measurement channel (11) and on a further channel (12), which ends in the low-pressure chamber (4), an analogue pressure transmitter (6) which is connected to a tone decoder which, for its part, is connected to a tachometer generator which monitors the fan (1). In the event of deviation of the frequency response of the signal of the pressure transmitter (6) from a prescribed characteristic, the tone decoder supplies a blocking signal for the gas valve (16) as a function of the speed of the fan (1).

Heating arrangement with a burner (7) fuelled from a gas mixture formation 
tube (2), such burner having a blower (1) on its input side and, via a gas 

supply control unit (5) including gas valves (16), a gas pressure control valve 
(17) and a gas nozzle (19), being associated with a gas feeder tube (3) 

which extends through an air inlet and projects into the gas mixture 
formation tube (2), with a first measuring channel (11) for measuring the 

mixture pressure (P
K
) ending in the said mixture formation tube (2), such 
measuring channel being connected with a pressure controller (27) of the 

gas pressure control valve (17) of the gas supply control unit (5), and with 
the blower (1 ) and a combustion chamber (8) which surrounds the burner (7) 

being arranged in a partial-vacuum chamber (4) provided with an open-ing 
(13) for admitting fresh air, with a second measuring channel (12) for 

measuring the pressure (P
L
) ending in the said partial-vacuum chamber (4), 
such second measuring channel being likewise connected with the said 

pressure controller (27), 
characterized in that,
 in addition to the pressure 
controller (27) there is linked to the first measuring channel (11) and to the 

second measuring channel (12) an analogous pressure sensor (6) comprising 
a sound decoder (24) which, in turn, is connected with a tachogenerator  

 
monitoring the blower (1), with the sound decoder (24), in the event that the 

frequency response of the signal of the pressure sensor (5) deviates from 
the response characteristic predetermined by the speed of the blower, supplying 

an inhibiting signal for the gas valves (16). 
Heating arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
pressure sensor (6) is associated with a storage for disturbing oscillations. 
Heating arrangement as claimed in Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
first measuring channel (11) and the second measuring channel (12) ending 

in the partial-vacuum chamber (4) extend through a connecting bracket (9) 
which is provided on the outside of the partial-vacuum chamber (4) and accommodates 

both the gas supply control unit (5) and the pressure sensor 

(6). 
Heating arrangement as claimed in Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
analogous pressure sensor (6) is designed as a differential pressure gauge 

whose two pressure chambers are connected with the first measuring channel 
(11) and the second measuring channel (12). 
Heating arrangement as claimed in Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a 
control device comprising a microprocessor is provided, which is linked with 

a recording memory capable of storing the interruptions caused by the inhibiting 
signal of the sound decoder (24) and reading out the stored data via 

a recording interface.
