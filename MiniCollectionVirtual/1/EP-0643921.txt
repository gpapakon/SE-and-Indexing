<ABSTRACT>
In charging a fluid molding material in an elastic 
molding die (1) composed of a die body (2) having an opening 

(3) and a film-formed die support portion (4) extending from 
the opening (3) to the outside by pouring the molding 

material from the opening (3) into the die body (2), the 
molding material in an amount of 1/5 to 3/5 of a volume of 

the die body (2) is first charged, a molding material-charged 
portion (7) of the die body (2) is then crumpled or 

pinched, and then the entire die body is filled up with the 
molding material, thereby charging the fluid 

molding material in the die body of the elastic molding die 
without occurrence of air voids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for charging a molding
material in an elastic molding die comprised of a hollow die
body having an opening and a film-formed die support portion
extending from said opening to the outside wherein pouring of
said fluid molding material from said opening into said die
body comprises the following method steps:
(a) first charging 1/5 to 3/5 of the volume of said die body
with a first quantity of the molding material;(b) processing the portion charged with the first quantity of
the molding material; and(c) then charging the remainder of the volume of said die
body by filling up the entire portion of said die body
with the molding material;The elastic material of which the molding die can be made
is e.g. rubber.Heretofore, there has been known a method for molding a
fluid molding material using an elastic molding die. In
this method, using an elastic molding die comprising a
hollow body (molding die) having an opening and a film-formed
die support portion, for example, conically extending
continuously from the opening to the outside, a fluid
molding material is poured into the molding die from the
opening to fill in the die, heated or cooled to solidify the 
molding material, and then the solidified molding is removed
from the elastic molding die through the opening utilizing
the elasticity of the molding die. This molding method is
suitable for molding chocolate, jelly, cheese, boiled fish
paste, lipsticks, and the like, compared to a molding method
using a rigid split molding die, and the resulting molding
has a good appearance and the molding cost is low.However, this method involves various problems in
charging the fluid molding material in the elastic molding
die body. For example, when molding chocolate by the
method, since molten chocolate has a viscosity of 5,000 to
12,000 cps, it is difficult to charge the material to fine-structured
corners of the die body. That is, an air void
occurs in a small projection in the die body, which is hard
to be filled with chocolate. As a result, surface
irregularities or pinholes occur in the molding, resulting
in an inferior appearance, and it is difficult to obtain a
product of a predetermined design.To eliminate such defects, a method has been proposed
in which the entire elastic molding die is covered with a
cup having a hole, the cup is evacuated from the hole to
inflate the elastic molding die and, with the elastic
molding die in the inflated condition, the molding material
is poured from the opening into the elastic molding

<CLAIMS>
A method for charging a molding material in an
elastic molding die (1) comprised of a hollow die body (2)

having an opening (3) and a film-formed die support portion
(4) extending from said opening (3) to the outside wherein

pouring of said fluid molding material from said opening (3)
into said die body (2) comprises the following method steps:


(a) first charging 1/5 to 3/5 of the volume of said die body
(2) with a first quantity of the molding material (7);
(b) processing the portion charged with the first quantity of
the molding material (7); and
(c) then charging the remainder of the volume of said die
body (2) by filling up the entire portion of said die

body (2) with the molding material (7);

characterized in that said processing is a crumpling operation
made such that the portion of the die body (2) charged with

the first quantity of the molding material (7) is passed
between


(i) two plates (31, 32) or
(ii) conveyor belts (41, 42) disposed in two rows or
(iii) rollers (51, 52) disposed in two rows

so that there are wider portions at the inlet and at the
outlet and the portion between them is narrower.
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the
portion of the die body (2) charged with the first quantity of

the molding material (7) is passed between the plates (31, 32)
or conveyor belts (41, 42) or rollers (51, 52) disposed so

that a central portion between the inlet and the outlet is the
narrowest.
