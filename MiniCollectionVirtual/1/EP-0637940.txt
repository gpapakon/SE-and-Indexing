<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRICALLY HEATED SURGICAL BLADE AND METHODS OF MAKINGThis invention relates to heated surgical instruments, particularly to improved blade structures for thermally autoregulated hemostatic instruments, such as scalpels.Background of the InventionThe control of bleeding during surgery accounts for a major portion of the time involved in an operation. In particular, bleeding that occurs when tissue is incised obscures the surgeon's vision, delays the operation, and reduces the precision of cutting.One technique for minimizing the bleeding of tissue as it is being severed is known as hemostatic surgery. This technique uses a heated instrument to contact bleeding tissue. The heat is transferred from the instrument to the incised (or torn) tissue to reform thermally collagen, thereby producing a thin collagenous film that seals over the severed blood vessels and capillaries, thereby reducing bleeding. Because heat is applied locally to tissue that contacts the heated region of the instrument, there is little tissue necrosis or damage that, if present, would retard healing.One such hemostatic instrument is known as a hemostatic surgical scalpel. This scalpel has a sharp cutting edge similar to that of a conventional steel 

scalpel blade, and a heating element proximate to the cutting edge to heat the blade. During cutting, the scalpel blade is heated and the heat is transferred to the tissue being cut. One commercial device using this technique is the Shaw Hemostatic Scalpel, manufactured and sold by the Hemostatic Surgery Corporation, San Francisco, California, and described in U.S. Patents 3,768,482, Re. 30,190, 4,481,057, and 4,485,810. This device uses a multi-segmented resistive heating element whereby the current flowing through each segment is individually controlled to maintain each segment, and hence the blade, within a narrow range of user-selected temperatures. A drawback of previously known hemostatic heated scalpel blades has been the inability to deliver an adequate quantity of heat in close proximity to the cutting edge, to maintain a sharp durable cutting edge, and to be usable for sustained surgery under a wide variety of surgical cutting applications. Sufficient thermal delivery is critical to seal promptly the blood vessels and capillaries being severed. The quantity of heat that must be delivered increases with the rate at which the scalpel is being moved through the tissue and the degree of vascularization of the tissue. These conditions have limited the cutting rate and depth that
