<ABSTRACT>
In a method of forming a stator for a stepping 
motor, the present invention first performs the 

cutting and bending process for forming comb teeth (16) 
by cutting a flat section (12) of a plate formed with a 

cylindrical section (14) around the flat portion (12) and 
bending the comb teeth (16) up to a first angle. Next, 

in the bending and thickness reducing process, the 
comb teeth are bent up to a second angle larger than 

the first angle and the thicknesses of the comb teeth 
are reduced so as to be uniform. Then, the first 

drawing process is performed to draw the cylindrical 
section at least one time. Finally, in the bending 

process, the comb teeth are bent up to a right angle. 
Thereby, the occurrence of cambers of the comb teeth 

and inclinations of comb teeth in the peripheral 
direction can be inhibited. Also, the squareness of 

the comb teeth can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a stator for a stepping motor and more 
particularly to a method of manufacturing a stator 
for a micro stepping motor whose outer cylindrical 
section has the diameter of 30 mm or less or a stator 
for a small size stepping motor having an outer 
cylindrical section drawn deeply. Generally, a stepping motor has, as shown in 
Fig. 1, a rotor 1, a shaft 2 and stators 31, 32, 41 
and 42. The stators 31, 32, 41 and 42 are each 
formed with a plurality of magnetic pole teeth (comb 
teeth) 3a, 3b, 4a or 4b at regular intervals in the 
peripheral direction. It is preferable to form the 
length of the comb teeth 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b long in 
order to increase the effective magnetic flux 
generated by the excitation of excitation coils 5a 
and 5b. However, when the comb teeth are formed by 
blanking simply a center of a single frame plate as 
conventional, the length of the comb teeth becomes 
less than half a blanking diameter, so that there 
is a limitation to obtain large effective magnetic 
flux. Although Japanese Patent Publication No.  
 
57-211964 discloses a method for solving the above 
problem, study was made to investigate a further 
problem upon manufacturing and a method was proposed 
in a United States Patent Application filed on 
March, 1, 1994. However , when the stepping motor is formed 
to be a micromotor or the outer cylindrical section 
of the stepping motor is drawn further deeply, above 
methods are not conducted much, since the outer 
cylindrical section is shaped so as to be drawn 
deeply as shown in Figs. 3 to 5. Such a method 
wherein the cylindrical section is drawn deeply has 
been proposed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 
3-53854. In this method, as shown by a cross section 
in Fig. 12A, first, a frame plate 10 is subjected to 
a drawing process to form a cylindrical section 14 
on the outer periphery of a flat section 12 such 
that the diameter of the flat section 12 becomes D1. 
Next, as shown in Fig. 12B, a plurality of comb teeth 
16 are cut from the flat section 12 and raised from 
the flat section 12 at a right angle such that the 
inside diameter of a concentric circle drawn by the 
root portions of the comb teeth becomes d1 and tips 
of the comb teeth are located close to the outer 
periphery of the flat portion 12. Next, as shown in 
Fig. 12C, the cylindrical section 14 is further  
 
subjected to a drawing process to make the diameter 
of the flat section 12 becomes D2. Finally, as shown 
in Fig. 12D, the
