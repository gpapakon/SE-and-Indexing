<ABSTRACT>
A device for transporting a roll (10) of a film material and loading it on a machine comprises: a roll-carrying cartridge (100) including, on the one hand, a frame formed from two lateral plates (flanges) (110,120) connected by spacers (130,140) and each provided with a central notch (111,121) intended to receive a spindle passing through a central opening (12) in the roll and, on the other hand, two pairs (151,152;161,162) of legs separated by a distance greater than the width of a first handling apparatus (1) on which the roll is delivered, the legs of each pair being, on the one hand, of a height such that the notches (111,121) are at a height above that of the central opening (12) in the low position of the first apparatus (1) and, on the other hand, connected by a crosspiece (170,180) of a length longer than the width of a second handling apparatus (2) intended to transport the cartridge (100). Application to the handling of supply rolls of thermoforming machines used in the agrifoodstuffs industry.

Device for transporting and installing on a machine 
(20) a reel (10) of a film material, characterised in that, 

the said reel is delivered on a first handling device (1) 
and the said device consists of: 


a reel-carrier cartridge (100) comprising on the one hand 
a frame formed by two side flanges (110, 120) linked at 

their ends by cross-pieces (130, 140) of a length greater 
than the width of the reel (10), the said cross-pieces 

being separated by a distance greater than the diameter of 
the said reel (10) and the said flanges each being provided 

with a central indentation (111, 121) designed to receive 
one end of a mandrel (11) passing through a central 

aperture (12) of the reel and, on the other hand, two pairs 
(151, 152; 161, 162) of feet, separated from each other in 

the direction of the side flanges (110, 120) by a distance 
greater than the width of the first handling device (1) , 

the feet of each pair being on the one hand of a height 
such that the said indentations (111, 121) are at a height 

greater than that of the central aperture (12) of the reel 
(10) when the handling device (1) is in the lowest 

position, and on the other hand, linked by a cross-piece 
(170, 180) parallel with the cross-pieces (130, 140), of a 

length in excess of the width of a second handling device 
(2) designed to transport the reel-carrier cartridge (100) 

to the machine (20), the distance thereof from the ground 
being less than the difference between the distance from 

the ground of the centre of the indentations (111, 121) and 
the radius of the reel (10), 
a receiving compartment (200) for the reel-holder 
cartridge (100), integrated in the machine (20), and having 

a side aperture (210) and a device (220) for inserting the 
reel-carrier cartridge (100) in the receiving compartment 

(200). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
said inserting device consists of two telescopic slide bars 

(221, 222) on which the said cross-pieces (132, 133; 142, 
143) rest. 
Device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that it 
has an indexing and adjusting device whereby the telescopic 

slide bars (221, 222) are moved laterally in steps. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it has a brake consisting of at least 

one hinge-mounted arm (310, 320) integral with the reel-carrier 
cartridge (100), on one end of which a brake 

fitting (311, 321) is mounted which acts on the mandrel 
(11) and is controlled at another end by a jack (330) 

integral with the receiving compartment (200). 
Method of transporting and installing a reel (10) of 
film material on a machine (20) by means of the device as 

claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
it consists of the following operations: 


the reel-carrier cartridge (100) is placed around the 
reel (10) arranged beforehand on the said first handling 

device (1), so that the central aperture (12) of the reel 
(12) opens at the lower part of the central indentations 

(111, 121) of the side flanges (110, 120), 
the reel (10) is mounted by means of the first handling 
device (1) such that the central aperture (12) of the reel 

(10) is released, 
the mandrel (11) is inserted inside the said central 
aperture (12), 
the reel (10) is lowered by means of the first handling 
device (1) and positioned such that the ends of the mandrel 

(11) are supported on the indentations (111, 121) of the 
side flanges (110, 120), 
the first handling device (1) is released under the 
cross-pieces (111, 121) of the pairs (151, 152; 161, 162) 

of feet,  
 
the second handling device (2) is installed under the 
cross-pieces (111, 121) of the pairs (151, 152; 161, 162) 

of feet, 
the reel-holder cartridge (100) fitted with the reel (10) 
is mounted and transported to the machine (20) by means of 

the second handling device (2), 
the reel-carrier cartridge (100) is positioned parallel 
with the machine (20) at the inlet of the receiving 

compartment (200), 
the inserting device (221, 222) is placed in position, 
the reel-carrier cartridge (100) is inserted in the 
receiving compartment (200).
