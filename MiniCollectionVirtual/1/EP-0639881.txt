<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical . 
power supply. The invention is particularly useful with 
respect to AC/DC power supplies for energizing relatively 
small load devices, such a small suction/compressor pump 
motors, and is therefore described below with respect to 
this application. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
power supply of the foregoing type having a number of 
advantages as will be set forth more particularly below. DE-A-40 11 790 discloses a battery backed-up power supply having the features of the preamble of Claim 1. According to the present invention, there is provided a power supply as defined in claim 1. 
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating one form of 
power supply constructed in accordance with the present 
invention; Fig. 2 is an electrical circuit diagram more 
particularly illustrating the construction of one form of 
power supply in accordance with the present invention; Fig. 3 diagrammatically illustrates the packaging 
of the power supply within a small portable housing for use 
with a portable compressor or suction pump.  
 Fig. 4 is an elevational view illustrating the 
rear side of the housing of Fig. 3; and Fig. 4a is a fractional view of Fig. 4 
illustrating a second position of a protective shutter 
mounted on the housing. The power supply illustrated in the drawings is 
particularly useful for connection to either an AC source or 
a DC source for supplying DC voltage to an electrical motor 
for driving a small suction/compressor pump. Thus, the 
block diagram illustrated in Fig. 1 shows the motor M as 
being supplied either via an AC input connector 2 or a DC 
input connector 4. When supplied via the AC input connector 
2, the AC is passed through an RFI (radio frequency 
interference) filter circuit 6, and a rectifier 8 to a 
switching and conversion circuit 10. The latter circuit is 
controlled by a control circuit 12 so as to provide, to a 
second rectifier circuit 14, an AC output of a frequency 
higher than the AC input 2 and having a duty cycle 
controlled by the control circuit 12. The second rectifier 
circuit 14 applies DC voltage to the electrical motor M via 
a manual switch SW1. The circuit illustrated in Fig. 1 further includes 
a battery BAT which is selectively charged from the second 
rectifier 14 under the control of a battery charging circuit 
16. The arrangement is such that the battery is connected 
to the electric motor M when the manual switch SW1 is closed 
and the AC input 2 is not connected to the circuit,
