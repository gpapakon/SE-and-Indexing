<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an assembly 
method, for head units (H) mounting 

a plurality of head chips (C) for discharging 
ink onto a frame (28), in which relative 

positions among head chips (C) are determined 
and which the head chips are 

secured onto the frame (28) so as to 
maintain the relative positions, to an 

assembly apparatus for head units (H) based 
on the method, and further to an ink 

jet output apparatus incorporating 
those head units (H). According to this 

invention, correction by each image output will not be required because the 
head unit (H) is able to complete adjustments 

of shifts of arrival positions of ink 
at its assembling stage, thereby making the apparatus compact and simple. In 

addition, correction of positional shifts will not be required when the heads 
are replaced, so that maintenance of the ink jet output apparatus will be easy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method and apparatus for assembling an ink jet head
unit.An ink jet type output method in which an image is formed by
discharging ink droplets is widely used in these days for it makes a printer
low noise and compact. In such ink jet method, a plurality of head chips
having linearly arrayed nozzles for discharging ink is arranged onto a carriage
with a fixed space between them, and each color ink is discharged through
the corresponding head chip to obtain a color image. In such a color ink jet
recording apparatus, arrival accuracy of ink discharged from each head chip greatly
affects image quality. For example, in the case of recording of 360 dpi, each
recording pitch is around 70 Âµm per recording spot. If the line shifts more
than a half recording spot, the image quality would be extremely impaired.
In particular, each chip may be subject to its tendency developed during its
process, so that ink may arrive with slight positional shifts. Therefore,
effective correction of such shifts would be required to keep high image
quality. A conventional ink jet recording apparatus of a serial type with a carriage
mounting plural head chips has corrected such shifts in the following manner.
In one method, where the recording apparatus is built with head chips individually
mounted onto the carriage, each head chip's tendency is checked, and the
mounting position thereof is adjusted to correct positional shifts of arrival
positions of ink.In another method, where the recording apparatus is built with head
chips formed in a united body with an ink cartridge, ink is discharged from
the head chips at a time that the recording apparatus is operated; the arrival positions of
ink are measured to provide information to be stored in a memory; and
timings of discharging ink are electrically controlled based on the information
stored.A method and an apparatus comprising the features of the pre-characterizing clauses of claims 1 and 9, respectively, are known through the last-mentioned method.Any method described above, however, makes an assembly line of the
recording apparatus complicated and thereby increases production costs. In addition, in
the method in which each head chip is adjusted and mounted, special skill is
required to replace the head units, so that users can not replace the head units and no
one can do maintenance of the recording apparatus easily. In the method in which
positional shifts are electrically adjusted, the recording apparatus may be formed in a
large size, and therefore,
