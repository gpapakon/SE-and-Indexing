<ABSTRACT>
The positioning control device of a hand welder helmet visor 
(9) comprises a control being fitted on the welding tool 

handle (2) and manageable by its holding user's hand, and 
insures that the welding tool only will be put in operation 

if the visor is brought down. 
One of its embodiments includes lever means (1), a flexible 
wire (4) slidable inside a sheath (5), a spring (6) fitted on 

the hinge of the visor (8) and blocking means (3) which 
hinders the welding tool operation whenever the visor is 

brought up. 
It will be also possible to use a pneumatical, hydraulic, 
electrical and electromagnetical radiation transmission 

between the tool handle and the visor. 
The technical field of the invention embraces the operator 
protection helmets for welding operations and similar ones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a positioning control device of a 
hand welder protection helmet visor manageable according to 
its user's conveniences or for operators doing similar 
workshop operations. Said device is conditioned in order to 
insure that the welding tool only will may be put in 
operation if the visor is brought down; on the other hand, 
its control is fitted near the welding tool handle so that it 
may be operated by the welder without needing to withdraw one 
of his hands from the piece to be welded as it has been 
necessary up till now. Some workshop operations must be practiced forcing their 
operators to work under the protection by a helmet for their 
eyes against the harmful bright radiation action or against 
the strike of solid particles or dust being thrown at high 
speed or fumes, for instance, welding, air jet cleaning 
operations, emery grinding, inter alia, the helmet being 
fastened on their heads and having a visor that must be 
brought down whenever the tool is in operation and may be 
brought up when the operation is interrupted and the operator 
wishes to relax the eyes or to examine in detail the piece 
being treated. On the presently existing and known helmet 
models for protecting a welder, the positioning of the visor 
thereof is directly accomplished by the operator using one of 
the hands and therefore having only a hand available for the 
work execution, or the bringing up and the bringing down of 
visors is obtained by means of a liquid crystal control 
operating independently of the operator's intention. On the 
other side, the operator can bring up the visor, even if the 
physical integrity of his eyeballs may be exposed to danger, 
and can also begin the work without the visor duly brought 
down. It should be emphasized that this fact has a very special 
interest just in the case of welding operations where the  
 
visor is meant for absorbing the ultraviolet radiation which 
are emitted during the welding process and for preventing 
damages to the welder's eyeballs (namely, the retina 
separation) ; however, the visor also absorbs strongly the 
visible radiations and renders extremely difficult the vision 
of the piece to be welded when the operation of the welding 
device is cut off. Usually, the bringing down and the 
bringing up of the welding helmet visors are accomplished by 
the welder with one of his hands while holding the flame 
torch or the welding pliers with the other. The consequences 
of such a fact are as follows: the over-all welding process 
is

<CLAIMS>
A positioning control device of a hand welder helmet 
visor, manageable according to its user's conveniences, 

characterized in that its control is fitted on the welding 
tool handle so that it may be operated by the user's 

holding hand and conditions the operation feasibility of 
the tool only to the case where the visor is brought down. 
The positioning control device of a hand welder helmet 
visor, according to claim 1, characterized in that said 

device includes: 

(a) lever means (1) fitted on the welding tool handle (2) 
being able to assume one of two stable positions, 

selected by the user according to his conveniences, 
corresponding respectively to the brought down or to the 

brought up position of the visor, and which acts as the 
control of the device; 
(b) a flexible wire (4) slidably encased within a sheath 
(5); 
(c) a spring (6) fitted on the hinge (7) of the helmet 
visor (8); and 
(d) blocking means (3) which hinders the welding tool 
operation whenever the visor is brought up. 
The positioning control device of a hand welder helmet 
visor, according to claim 2, characterized in that said 

blocking means (3) consists of an electric current 
switch, when the welding tool is electrical welding 

pliers. 
The positioning control device of a hand welder helmet 
visor, according to claim 2, characterized in that said 

blocking means (3) consists of a shut-off valve fitted on 
the gas feeding tubing, when the welding tool is a flame 

torch. 
The positioning control device of a hand welder helmet 
visor, according to anyone of preceding claims, 

characterized in that said visor (8) is a visor which is 
either an usually brought up one or an usually brought 

down visor. 
The positioning control device of a hand welder helmet 
visor, according to claim 1, characterized in that said 

control has a pneumatical, hydraulic, electric or 
electromagnetic radiation transmission system between the 

handle and the visor and uses the corresponding fittings.
