<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic resin composition is provided 
comprising an aromatic polycarbonate resin, rubber 

modified vinyl aromatic-vinyl cyanide graft 
copolymer, and glass fibers which have been treated 

with polyolefin wax and optionally a functionalized 
silane. The nature of the coating on the glass 

fibers provides the composition with improved impact 
strength over binding glass. The composition is 

useful as molding material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to glass
reinforced blend of aromatic polycarbonate resin and
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene graft copolymers
which contain uniformly dispersed therein finely
divided fibrous glass which contains a particular
coating agent thereon, and more particularly relates
to such compositions wherein the coating agent
comprise a polyolefin wax and with a optionally
functionalized silane binding agent.Fibrous glass, when incorporated with a
thermoplastic polymer, beneficially aids the
mechanical properties of the polymer which results in
greater application thereof. In the manufacture of
the fibrous glass, filaments are first formed through
the use of various processes. The filaments are then
gathered into a bundle known as a strand. In order
to bind the filaments into a strand so that the
strand can be handled, a binder or binding agent is
applied to the glass filaments. Subsequently, the
strand can be chopped into various lengths as
desired. These are called chopped strands. Some of
these binding agents are polymers such as polyvinyl
acetate, particular polyester resins, starch, acrylic
resins, melamine, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene
oxide, polyurethane, polyepoxide, or polyvinyl
alcohol. In the particular area of thermoplastic
aromatic polycarbonate resins, the fibrous glass 
enhances some of the mechanical properties of the
polycarbonate resin. Unfortunately, in such
polycarbonate resin compositions, the addition of
such glasses can substantially lower the room
temperature Notched Izod impact strengths of the
fiber reinforced compositions, and it can also
substantially reduce the biaxial impact (instrument
impact) energies of such compositions. Glass fibers
employing a non-bonding olefinic sizing agent which
does not chemically bond with the polycarbonate resin
have been previously employed in fiber reinforced
polycarbonate resin compositions and have resulted in
improved notched Izod impact strengths thereof
compared to other glass filled polycarbonate
compositions. Utilization of such glasses in blends
of polycarbonate with other resins would not be
expected to show such improvements due to bonding the
likelihood of the glass bonding with the non-polycarbonate
resinous components of the blend
compositions.Polymer blends containing an aromatic
polycarbonate resin, and rubber modified graft
copolymer, such as a acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene
(ABS) graft copolymer, a styrene acrylonitrile
copolymer (SAN) and glass fiber reinforcements have
in the past typically shown
