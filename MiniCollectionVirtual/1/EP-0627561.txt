Radial blower with a spiral housing (1), which begins
at a housing tongue (2) extending the shell of the

spiral housing with an edge (5) at its free end, which
together with the end region of the shell of the spiral

housing defines a discharge opening of the blower, and
with an impeller (3) housed in the spiral housing and

having vanes (4), which with their external edges (6)
remote from the impeller axis run past the housing

tongue edge (5), which is curved with a turning point
and is inclined in relation to the external edges (6)

and covers at least one space between two consecutive
external edges (6), characterised in that the housing

tongue edge (5) has the largest gradient in relation to
the external edges (6) of the vanes (4) in the region

of the central plane (7) of the impeller (3).
