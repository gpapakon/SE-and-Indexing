<ABSTRACT>
A humanized antibody is provided, which is obtained by transplantation of the complementarity determining region of a mouse monoclonal antibody B-B10 specific to a human IL-2 receptor into a human antibody. The antibody has a very low antigenicity, and therefore, it is useful for treatment of carcinoma expressing IL-2 receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a humanized
antibody specific to a human IL-2 receptor. More
particularly, it relates to a humanized antibody obtained
by transplantation of the complementarity- determining
region (hereinafter, referred to as CDR) of a mouse
monoclonal antibody B-B10 specific to a human IL-2 receptor
into a human antibody, and a composition comprising said
antibody as an active ingredient.The structure and function of the antibody
related to the present invention will be first explained.
Namely, such structure and function are described in
details in Kabat et al.: Sequences of proteins of
immunological interest, 4th Ed., 1989, NIH, U.S.A. as well
as Roitt et al.: Immunology, 2nd Ed., 1989, Gower Medical
Publishing, U.S.A. & U.K.The antibody (immunoglobulin) is an antigen-specific
glycoprotein as produced by B lymphocytes when a
subject is sensitized with an antigen which is a foreign
substance to the subject. As the human immunoglobulin,
there are known 5 classes, i.e., IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and 
IgE. In case of IgG, it has two light chains (L chains) of
polypeptide having a molecular weight of about 25,000 and
two heavy chains (H chains) of polypeptide having a
molecular weight of about 51,000. Between H-L chains and
between H-H chains, there is usually present a disulfide
bond connecting two chains. An amino acid sequence
consisting of about 100 amino acids at N terminal of each
of the H and L chains is antigen-specific and represents an
antigen-binding site. This part is called a variable (V)
region. Subsequent amino acid sequence consisting of 400
amino acids in H chain or 150 amino acids in L chain is
called a constant (C) region which is identical among all
immunoglobulins belonging to a Ig Class such as IgG or IgM
Class, or those belonging to a subclass such as igG1 or
IgG2. It is known that human IgG may have Cκ or Cλ in L
chain and Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3 or Cγ4 in H chain. L and H chains
having one of these identified partial structures are
called κ, λ, γ1, γ2, γ3 and γ4 chain, respectively.H and L chain contain "domain structures". For
instance, H chain is composed of VH, CH1, CH2, CH3 domains
and hinge regions connecting CH1 and CH2 domains.The variable region comprises four framework
regions in which relatively conservative amino acid
sequences are retained among various antibodies and three
CDRs which are relatively variable in the amino acid 
sequence among different antibodies. In one molecule of an
antibody which comprises two H chains and two L chains,
there ar present six CDRs
