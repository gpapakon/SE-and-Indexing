signal, and a tone generator (28) coupled to the level shifter 

(27) for generating an audible tone whose frequency is a function 
of the relative motion of moving objects (30) detected by the 

system (10). Further associated is an FM transmitter (14)

transmitting the audible tone indicative of the motion of a 
moving object (30); and an FM receiver (16) adapted to receive 

the audible tone produced by the FM transmitter (14) and to 
reproduce the tone to indicate the presence of moving objects 

(30) detected by the system (10)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion detecting
continuous wave (CW) radar system that is adapted to detect
motion of a moving object, said system comprising:
a CW radar transmitter comprising an oscillator, a CW
antenna, and a mixer coupled to the oscillator and the CW
antenna,a receiver coupled to the CW radar transmitter that
comprises a signal processor that includes amplifiers adapted
to receive output signals from the mixer, detectors coupled
to the amplifiers for receiving the output signals of said
amplifiers, and a tone generator coupled to the detectors for
generating an audible tone indicative of the motion of moving
objects detected by the system,a transmitter comprising an antenna coupled to the receiver
for transmitting the audible tone indicative of the motion of
a moving object, anda receiver adapted to receive the audible tone produced
by the transmitter and reproduce the tone to indicate the
presence of moving objects detected by the system. Such a radar system is known from EP-A-0 058 032. The present invention relates generally to radars, and more particularly, to a
motion detection radar system that is adapted to produce radar warnings signals
regarding the presence of moving objects that are located behind structural barriers, and
the like.Law enforcement agencies have an urgent need for a low cost, easily portable,
system for detecting the presence of people inside buildings or behind walls where the
subjects cannot be seen. The system must have the capability to penetrate most
common building materials such as wood, stucco and concrete. It is also necessary for
the system to penetrate bushes, shrubs, and other foliage. It must provide a positive
indication of people moving at distances of at least 6.10 m (20 feet) on the other side of the
barrier. It must be able to look through both common floors and ceilings. The system
must be battery operated and provide for remote, wire free operation.A number of different types of radars have been developed that can detect the
motion of a person in a clear environment. Most of these radars are doppler radars. A
doppler radar measures the motion of a object in terms of the difference in frequency of
the received radar signal as compared to the frequency of the transmitted radar signal.
The motion of the object causes this change in frequency in the same way that the
sound of the whistle of a passing train changes. The doppler frequency difference is
equal to two times the speed of the object (toward or away from the radar) times the
opera
