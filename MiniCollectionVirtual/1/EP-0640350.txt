<ABSTRACT>
Ferrite particles obtainable by coprecipitation of 
ferrous and ferric salts from aqueous solution, are free of 

hydrous oxides chelatable with EDTA. They are thus 
particularly pure, and suitable as vectors for therapeutic 

or diagnostic use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ceramic particles of the
type that can be used for therapeutic or diagnostic
purposes, and to their preparation.The preparation of inorganic, metal oxide particles
for therapeutic delivery is described in WO-A-9204916.
Such particles can be prepared with a dextran or other
polymer coating. The particles may be prepared by
coprecipitation of ferrous and ferric salts from aqueous
solution.Kronick et al, J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 12 (1986) 73-80, also
discloses particles produced by precipitation from ferrous/ferric ions in the presence of dextran.According to the present invention, known such
particles, coated with a biologically - tolerable polymer such as dextran, are free of hydrous oxides. As illustrated in
the Example, the preparation of the particles gives
desirable homogeneity and avoidance of water-soluble
materials that may adversely affect the desired slow
metabolism. The Example obviates column chromatography,
for which the use of centrifugal concentrators has been
substituted, and involves the corresponding omission of
NaCl elution buffers. EDTA is used as a chelating agent in
the buffer used in the first washing steps. This
apparently dissolves the iron in the hydrous oxides, but
does not dissolve the well-formed ferrites. The result is
a stable and uniform particle preparation with low toxicity
(because it is a substantially pure ceramic preparation).DNA, RNA, plasmids, ribosomal particles, nucleic acid
binding-proteins, and any other necessary molecules may be
caused to adhere to the outer surface of any one of a
variety of metal oxide or mixed metal crystals of coated or
uncoated type or to be attached to the surface of or
included in the body of a variety of other types of
biodegradable particles of appropriate size and capable of
surface attachment to a cell adhesion molecule. There may
be included on the surface one of a variety of nerve
adhesion molecules or muscle adhesion molecules which bind
to the surface of nerve and muscle cells, but preferably to
muscle cells. When such particles are constructed and then
administered by routine percutaneous intramuscular
injection, an exceedingly safe and efficient transfection
process is initiated. The particles adhere to the outer
surfaces of muscle cells and to the outer surfaces of the
axon termini of motor nerve cells or preferably to the
dendritic or sensory process of sensory axons within the
muscle. After adherence, the particles are ingested into
the nerve and muscle cells by a natural process termed
adsorpti
