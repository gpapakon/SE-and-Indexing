<ABSTRACT>
An AC-coupled receiver is provided which allows data with long 
periods of no signal sent on a fiber optic bus to be received 

without the normally required preamble. The receiver provides 
a voltage signal (21) which is AC-coupled (23) to one side of 

a differential amplifier (25) with a delayed (37) voltage 
signal AC-coupled (41) to the other input of the differential 

amplifier (25). If the time constant of the AC coupling 
network (23, 41) is much longer than the signal baud time, 

low-frequency variations at the two inputs of the differential 
amplifier (25) will be nearly identical and the low frequency 

signals will effectively cancel each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to AC-coupled fiber optic 
receivers and more particularly to an AC-coupled fiber optic 
receivers that do not require message preambles for proper 
operation. Optical receivers translate pulses of optical energy into 
equivalent electrical signals. The optical pulses produce 
small currents in a photosensitive semiconductor, which are 
amplified and processed by electronic circuits to produce an 
electrical signal that duplicates the optical pulses. The signals can be of two general types: DC-coupled and AC-coupled. 
DC-coupled circuits respond to the magnitude of the 
optical signals no matter how much time elapses between signal 
transitions. These circuits are always prepared to translate 
the magnitude of the optical input to a high or low logic 
value. This feature is desirable when processing data that 
comes in unpredictable bursts. The major disadvantage of DC-coupled 
circuits is that their signals drift with temperature 
and age. They are especially difficult to use when high 
amplification is necessary. Most optical receivers use AC-coupled circuits which cannot 
respond to signals that change too slowly. AC-coupled 
circuits do not suffer the disadvantages of signal drift with 
temperature and age that the DC-coupled circuits are subject 
to, but the AC-coupled circuits are not always prepared to 
process data. AC circuits need time to settle and stabilize 
after the input signal begins before they can properly 
interpret the data. To compensate for this characteristic of  
 
AC-coupled receivers, data is prefixed with a "preamble" 
string of pulses that prepares the receiver to receive data. It is an object of the present invention to provide an AC-coupled 
fiber optic receiver that does not require a preamble 
before the data to be processed. It is another object of the present invention to provide an 
AC-coupled fiber optic receiver that is easy to use with any 
two-level data format independent of the time between optical 
signal transitions. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an 
AC-coupled fiber optic receiver with an increased signal to 
noise ratio. In one aspect of the present invention an AC-coupled receiver 
for extracting a digital signal from a digitally encoded 
analog signal is provided. A first AC coupling network 
couples the analog signal to the first input of a differential 
amplifier. A delay means is coupled to the analog signal and 
provides a delayed analog signal, the delay time being short 
relative to the baud
