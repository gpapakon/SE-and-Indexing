<ABSTRACT>
Polyester or polyamide compositions of intermediate and high molecular weights which are attained by reacting at least one lower molecular weight polyester or polyamide with an effective amount of a lactamyl phosphite. The reaction may be carried out by blending these constituents and any other optional constituents and is preferably formed by melt blending.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLYESTER OR POLYAMIDECOMPOSITIONS COMPRISING LACTAMYL PHOSPHITESAS CHAIN EXTENDING AGENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to polyester or polyamide compositions, more particularly to compositions and processes which are related to chain extended polyester or polyamide compositions.2. Description of the Prior ArtPolyester and polyamide compositions are known as useful in a wide range of applications as engineering materials due to their favorable physical properties. See for example, US Patent 4,568,720; 5,037,897 and EP Published Application Nos. 0 232 878 and 0 232 879.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect of the invention, there are provided polyester compositions of intermediate and high molecular weights which are attained by reacting with at least one lower molecular weight polyester or polyamide with an effective amount of a lactamylphosphite as a constituent. The reaction may be carried out by biending these constituents and any other optional constituents in a melt. The lactamyl phosphate acts as chain extender to the polyesters and polyamides, and thereby proving materials which exhibit improved physical characteristics than those provided in the art. 

 Further aspects of the invention not particularly recited here will become apparent upon a reading of the accompanying specification of the preferred embodiments and the claims below.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSCompositions of the present invention include the reaction product of one or more polyesters or one or more polyamides with one or more iactamyl phosphites.Polyesters which may be employed in the process of this invention are linear or branched polyesters, which may be used singly or in mixture of two or more types of polyesters. The particular polyester or polyesters selected may be hompolyesters, copolyesters or mixtures thereof. Generally the polyesters used are the condensation product of an organic dicarboxγlic acid and an organic diol, which will be more particularly described below. The type of polyester is not critical and the particular polyester chosen for use in any particular situation will depend essentially on the ultimate physical properties of the final article of manufacture.Suitable polyesters include those which are the condensation reaction products of aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic dills.Particularly suitable aromatic diols include those having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as but not limited to:
