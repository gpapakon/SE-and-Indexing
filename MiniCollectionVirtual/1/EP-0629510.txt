<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an image receiving material 
containing on a support an image receiving layer having as a 

principal component the hardened product of (i) a vinylchloride-based 
resin containing active hydrogens, (ii) an aliphatic 

polyisocyanate having 3 isocyanate groups as specified in the claims 
and (iii) a polydialkylsiloxane containing active hydrogens. The 

present invention further relates to a method for making an image 
receiving element and to a method for obtaining images therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to receiving elements for use 
according to thermal dye sublimation transfer. Thermal dye transfer methods include thermal dye sublimation 
transfer also called thermal dye diffusion transfer. This is a 
recording method in which a dye-donor element provided with a dye 
layer containing sublimating dyes having heat transferability is 
brought into contact with a receiver sheet and selectively, in 
accordance with a pattern information signal, heated with a thermal 
printing head provided with a plurality of juxtaposed 
heat-generating resistors, whereby dye is transferred from the 
selectively heated regions of the dye-donor element to the receiver 
sheet and forms a pattern thereon, the shape and density of which is 
in accordance with the pattern and intensity of heat applied to the 
dye-donor element. The dye-image receiving element for use according to dye 
sublimation transfer usually comprises a support, e.g. paper or a 
transparent film, coated with a dye-image receiving layer, into 
which the dye can diffuse more readily. An adhesive layer may be 
provided between the support and the receiving layer. Means for 
improving the releasability of the receiving element from the donor 
element after transfer is effected are normally provided in the very 
receiving layer or on the top of it, a separate release layer may be 
coated. As resins constituting the dye-image receiving layer there are 
known various thermoplastic vinylcopolymers having glass transition 
temperatures in the range of 50°C to 100°C such as copolymers of 
vinylchloride and vinylacetate, aromatic polyesters and styrene-acrylonitrile 
acrylates. Receiving elements for use in thermal dye diffusion transfer 
have been described in e.g. EP 133012, EP 394460, US 4.985.397, EP 
543441 and WO 93/07002. The dye layer of a dye donor element can be a monochrome dye 
layer or it may comprise sequential repeating areas of different 
coloured dyes like e.g. of cyan, magenta, yellow or optionally black  
 
hue. When a dye-donor element containing three or more primary 
colour dyes is used, a multicolour image can be obtained by 
sequentially performing the dye transfer process steps for each 
colour. One of the possible applications of thermal dye sublimation 
transfer printing is the production of hard copies of medical 
diagnostic images. Although such a hard copy can be produced on a 
reflective support such as paper, in most applications hard copies 
are produced on transparencies. These hard copies can be 
monoch
