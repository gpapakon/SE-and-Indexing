<ABSTRACT>
An electrical instruction signal transmitter which can be actuated as desired is present in the switching device for lighting the interior of motor vehicles, in which device a control device automatically switches the interior lighting on and off according to a predetermined switching program as a function of operating state parameters of the motor vehicle, which electrical instruction signal transmitter is connected to the control device. When driven by the instruction signal transmitter, the control device switches the switching program off and switches the interior lighting on continuously.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit arrangement for internal lighting for motor vehicles, in which a 
control equipment (1') switches the internal lighting on and off automatically 

following a prescribed switching programme, depending on the parameters 
of the operational condition of the vehicle, 
characterised in that
 a selectively 
operable electrical controller (12) is present, which is connected to the 

control equipment (1') via a lightly loaded control wire, and that the control 
equipment, on command from the controller, switches the switching 

program off and the internal lighting continuously on. 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
switched on period of the internal lighting is limited in time. 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
internal lighting is switched off on locking the vehicle doors. 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the internal lighting can be switched off, if a representative switching 
condition of the on-board circuit is present for the removal from service of 

the vehicle. 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the switching programme can be restored by a fresh command to the  
 

control equipment from the controller. 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised 
in that
 the internal lighting can be switched continuously off by the 
activation of a different type of command from the contoller (12). 
A circuit arrangement according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the 
switching command can be initiated by activation of the controller (12) for 

a prescribed switching time of a few seconds, 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised 
in that
 the controller (12) is a push-button switch. 
A circuit arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised 
in that
 the controller (12) is integrated into an internal lighting unit (4).
