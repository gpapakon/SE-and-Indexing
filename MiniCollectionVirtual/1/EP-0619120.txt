<ABSTRACT>
A therapeutic agent for cat respiratory diseases 
which contains a human interferon as an effective ingredient. 

The therapeutic agent exerts a strong efficacy on cats with 
only a small dose even if administered to them orally or 

parenterally, and reduces the labor and burden of veterinaries 
and cat owners by a large margin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medicament for
animals directed to cats, more particularly, to a therapeutic
agent for cat respiratory diseases which contains a human
interferon(s) (sometimes abbreviated as "HuIFN(s)" hereinafter)
as an effective ingredient.Recently, the number of people, who find their mental
richness in their daily lives with pet animals, has been
increasing as the improvement of their incomes and life-styles.
Among pet animals, especially cats and dogs are the most
popular ones from ancient times, and a variety of species of
them have been produced by successive breedings for many years.
Some of the species are amazingly costly. As is evident from
the above-mentioned recent tendency, the number of tame cats
has been remarkably increasing, and this results in an
increment of cats brought to veterinary hospitals.Excluding cats with traumas and fractures requiring
for surgery, the number of other cats, suffering from
infectious diseases, especially, respiratory diseases, i.e.
"feline cold", and being brought to veterinary hospitals, is
increasing. The main inducer of feline cold has been deemed 
to be viruses infected to feline airways, and felines infected
with viruses mostly show common cold-like symptoms such as
cough, rhinorrhea, drooling, fever, inflammation of superior
airway, pneumonia, stomatitis, glossitis, conjunctivitis,
granular adenitis, lingual ulcer, ulcer of nasal end,
systematic skin ulcer, turbinal ulcer, scours, vomiting,
anorexia and reduction of vitality. More particularly, when
felines are infected with feline immunodeficiency virus
(sometimes abbreviated as "FIV" hereinafter), they become more
apparently to show the above-mentioned symptoms and rapidly
weaken. At present, there exists no treatment worth mentioning
for feline virus diseases as well as feline respiratory
diseases, and actually these diseases are only treated with
symptomatic treatments such as trophotherapy by administering
to felines to be treated nutrient feeds in order to relieve
their dehydration symptoms and to recover their physical
vitality, as well as administering antibiotics to them to
prevent multiple or secondary infections and physically
removing viscous secreta.Recently, it was reported by Tomiya UCHINO et al.,
in Shodobutsu-Rinsho, Vol.11, No. 6, pp.11-25 (1992) that an
intravenous administration of several millions of international
units of a recombinant feline interferon to a feline suffering
from respiratory diseases exerted a considerably-high
therapeutic effect. In order to

<CLAIMS>
Use of a natural human interferon α derived from BALL-1
cells for the manufacture of a therapeutic agent for the

treatment of cat respiratory diseases induced by viral
infection of feline airways.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the treatment
comprises administration of the interferon α at a dose of

0.005-5000 IU/kg weight of cat.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the agent is in
the form of an oral or parenteral agent.
Use according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein:

(a) the therapeutic agent is in the form of a
dehydrated injection, gel, powder or granule form

and
(b) the natural human interferon α has a specific
activity of at least 10
5
 IU/mg protein.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
agent further comprises a member selected from the group

consisting of cat serum albumin, gelatin, and maltose.
A therapeutic agent for cat respiratory diseases
induced by viral injection of feline airways, which is in

the form of a dehydrated injection, gel, powder or granule
form and comprises:


(i) as an effective ingredient a natural human
interferon α which is derived from BALL-1 cells and 

which has a specific activity of at least about 10
5

IU/mg protein; and
(ii) a member selected from the group consisting of
cat serum albumin, gelatin and maltose;

said natural human interferon α being incorporated in said
agent in an amount which can be administered to a cat at a

dose of about 0.005-5000 international units per kg weight
of said cat.
