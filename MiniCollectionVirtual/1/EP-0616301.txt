<ABSTRACT>
2.1 As devices for recording road-use charges, there are known toll systems which require on-road arrangements, such as, for example, barrier systems, at all the possible exits of the chargeable road sector. 2.2 The new device contains a road-storage arrangement (1) which stores electronically, in addition to a road network, parameters representing a charge fraction due for each segment of the road network, as well as means (5) for vehicle-position determination and a computer unit (6) which determines the road-use charge for covering a specific distance by vehicle at least as a function of the parameter and position data. An adaptation to changing charges is possible in a simple way with this device by means of the storage of new and/or further charge-influencing parameters. 2.3 Use in road vehicles.

Device for determining the toll for a vehicle
travelling over a route section, comprising


a road storage device (1), arranged to be vehicleborne,
in which data of at least one road network

are electronically stored, and
means (5), arranged to be vehicle-borne, for determining
the position of the vehicle,

characterized in that

in the road storage device (1), data of at least one
entire toll-chargeable road network with associated

road toll parameters, which are in each case allocated
to a particular road section of the road

network and represent a proportional road toll due
for the use of this section, are stored, and
a computer unit (6), arranged to be vehicle-borne,
is provided which is connected to the road storage

device (1) and the positioning means (5) and determines
the toll due for the use of the route sections

travelled by the vehicle at least from the data of
the position determining means and the road storage

device.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the road storage device contains an erasable memory

(2), a receiver unit (3) for receiving updated data of
the road network and/or the road toll parameters and an

input unit (4) for writing the received updated data into
the memory (2).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
by a storage device (7), connected to the computer unit

(6), for electronic storage of the data of environmental 
toll parameters which represent a proportional toll

dependent on the current environmental situation of the
vehicle and taken into consideration by the computer unit

in the determination of the toll.
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the environmental toll parameter storage device (7)

contains an erasable memory (8), a receiver unit (3) for
receiving updated environmental toll parameter data and

an input unit (9) for writing the received updated data
into the memory (8).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
by a storage device (11), connected to the

computer unit (6), for the electronic storage of data of
vehicle-related toll parameters which represent a

vehicle-related proportional toll which is taken into
consideration by the computer unit during the determination

of the toll.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the vehicle toll parameter storage device (11)

contains an erasable memory (12), means for registering
the values of the vehicle toll parameters (14) and an

input unit (13) writing the output data of the latter
into the memory (12).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the computer unit (6) determines the

value of the in each case currently accrued toll and
outputs it via an output unit (15) to a visual display

unit (16).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the computer unit (6) determines the

value of the total toll accrued during a trip and outputs
it via an output unit (17).
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the output signal of the output unit for the total

toll (17) is supplied to the visual display unit (16).
Device according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized in
that the output signal of the output unit for the total

toll (17) is supplied to a debiting unit (18), which can
be fed with a user card (19) for debiting the toll.
