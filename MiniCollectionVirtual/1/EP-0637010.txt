<ABSTRACT>
A display device controller has digital RGB colour signal lines and 
horizontal and vertical sync signal lines (7, 8). NAND gates (9) 

detect in respect of at least one of the RGB colour signal lines when 
the digital signal on that line corresponds to a black level, and a 

D/A converter (10) and an adder (+) add to at least one of the 
horizontal and vertical sync signal lines a signal corresponding to 

the black level signal so detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display device controller, for 
example for display devices for personal computers, such as CRT 
display devices and liquid crystal display devices. The colour display on a computer display device is based upon on an 
additive mixture process of three primary colours red, blue and green 
(referred to as RGB). By individually adjusting the luminous intensity 
of each of the three colour components RGB, in principle it is 
possible to display all colours falling within a triangle formed by 
connecting the three points of the RGB primary colours in a 
chromaticity diagram. Therefore, displaying a black image on the 
display device can be accomplished by properly adjusting the luminous 
intensity of each of the three RGB components for each picture element 
of the screen which is to be black. The interface between a personal computer display device and its 
controller is typically configured as shown in Fig. 1, where a display 
device controller 2 to which video data to be displayed is input, and 
which is provided within a personal computer 1, is connected to a 
display device 3 such as a CRT display device or liquid crystal 
display by five signal lines: three RGB signal lines, one for red (R), 
one for green (G) and one for blue (B), and vertical (V) and 
horizontal (H) synchronous (sync) signal lines. Generally, for analog RGB processes, three RGB analog signals having 
an amplitude of from 0V to 0.7V are transferred from the controller to 
the display device via the RGB colour signal lines. For each of the 
RGB analog signals, 0V corresponds to black and 0.7V corresponds to 
white, and the colour intensity of each primary RGB colour is 
individually adjusted in the range from 0V to 0.7V according to the 
particular colour to be displayed. In a CRT display device, for 
example, each analog RGB signal thus supplied to the CRT is amplified 
proportionately to provide a signal having a voltage ranging from a 
black level potential to a white level potential and applied to the 
CRT cathode.  
 CRT and other display devices generally have a manual control for 
adjusting brightness, allowing the user to change the brightness of 
the display screen. To make brighter the screen of a CRT display, for 
example, by moving the manual control, the entire colour signal being 
amplified within the display device is shifted from the black level 
potential towards the white level potential and the voltage applied to 
the CRT cathode is increased; thus the whole screen is made brighter.
