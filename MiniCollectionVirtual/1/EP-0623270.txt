<DESCRIPTION>
 VIDEO TELECONFERENCING SYSTEMField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a video teleconferencing system. Specifically, the present invention relates to a video teleconferencing system that provides a wide aspect ratio, panoramic view at each teleconferencing site. This is accomplished using a single NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) camera and projector at each site and using NTSC transmission facilities.Background of the InventionThe goal of a video teleconferencing system is to bring teleconferencing participants as "close together" as possible. Ideally, the effect obtained in a good teleconferencing system should be one of "being there". The traditional video teleconference facility puts extreme limitations on the normal human protocols for interaction. Most traditional teleconference facilities offer some version of NTSC video which is displayed on a small-sized, home-television-like monitor. When the number of teleconference participants at the sending end of a conference is larger than one, the image of each participant occupies a small portion of an already small viewing area. As a result, it becomes difficult for viewers at the receiving end of such a teleconference to pick up non-verbal cues from a speaker's face and body. Indeed, in many cases, it is often difficult to discern at the receiving end who of the many participants at the sending end is actually talking.To overcome this problem, it is desirable for a video teleconferencing facility to replace the conventional 

 monitor with a larger monitor which provides a wide aspect ratio, panoramic view of the remote teleconferencing site. An ordinary NTSC monitor is relatively square, having an aspect ratio which is four units in the horizontal direction to three units in the vertical direction (i.e., 4x3=1.33x1) . Because of this, it is not desirable to simply replace the conventional small-sized teleconference monitor, with a large-sized monitor having the same NTSC aspect ratio. The reason is that in many cases a plurality of teleconference participants at a remote site sit side- by-side. When an image of the remote site is locally displayed on an NTSC monitor of any size, good interaction with the participants at the remote site is not achieved, as the relatively square aspect ratio of the NTSC monitor does not permit a wide enough view of the remote conference site. Accordingly, it is desirable to replace the small- sized NTSC monitor of the conventional teleconference facility with a monitor having a wide aspect

 CLAIMS 1. A teleconferencing system comprising a transmitting station comprising an NTSC camera and a transformation element coupled to said NTSC camera for introducing a transformation into an image produced by said NTSC camera to map a wide aspect ratio field of view into said image produced by said NTSC camera, and a receiving station connected to said transmitting station by a transmission channel, said receiving station comprising means for receiving said NTSC image generated by said NTSC camera including reversing means for reversing said transformation introduced into said NTSC image at said transmitting station and means for displaying said image on a screen having a wide aspect ratio to provide a wide aspect view of said transmitting station at said receiving station.
2. The teleconferencing system of claim 1 wherein said transformation element is an optical element.
3. The teleconferencing system of claim 2 wherein said optical element comprises an anamorphic lens optically coupled to an optical input of said NTSC camera.
â€¢

 8. The teleconferencing system of claim 1 wherein said means for reversing said transformation comprises a second anamorphic lens.
9. A teleconferencing system comprising first and second stations in communication with each other, each station including means for generating a video image for transmission to the other station and for receiving a video image transmitted from the other station, each station including means for transforming an aspect ratio of a video image generated by it and means for reversing an aspect ratio transformation in a video image received by it.
10. The teleconferencing system of claim 9 wherein said video image generating means at each station is a video camera.
11. The teleconferencing system of claim 10 wherein said video camera is an NTSC video camera.
12. The teleconferencing system of claim 9 wherein said transforming means comprises an optical element. 13. The teleconferencing station of claim 9 wherein said transforming means comprises an electronic circuit. 14. The teleconferencing system of claim 9 wherein said aspect ratio transformation is between a wide aspect ratio and an NTSC aspect ratio. 15. A video teleconferencing station comprising an NTSC camera for generating a first NTSC video image for transmission to a remote station, transformation means for transforming said first video image to map a wide aspect field of view into said first NTSC video image, an NTSC projector for receiving a second NTSC video image from a remote location including means for reversing a transformation introduced into said second NTSC 


 video image at said remote location for forming a wide aspect ratio image for display at said station.
16. The video teleconferencing station of claim 15 wherein said transformation means comprises an optical element coupled to an optical input of said camera.
17. The video teleconferencing station of claim 15 wherein said transformation means comprises a resampling circuit connected to an electronic output of said camera.
18.
