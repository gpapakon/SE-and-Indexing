<ABSTRACT>
There is described an assay system for the assessment of unoccupied specific ligand binding sites on proteins in biological fluids. The assay is carried out with a multilayer assay element and is based on the principle of equilibrium distribution in which a ligand distributes itself between unoccupied sites on the proteins and the remainder of the element. The ligand can be labeled with a detectable moiety or it may be unlabeled and detected through the use of another detectable species. In one embodiment the assay format is utilized to estimate the number of sites on thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) which are not occupied by thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to assays for the 
assessment of unoccupied binding sites on proteins in 
biological fluids such as thyroxine binding proteins in 
serum or plasma samples. Thyroxine (T4) is a hormone produced by the 
thyroid gland which is essential for growth and 
development. In blood more than 99% of the total T4 
present is bound to serum proteins, mainly TBG. When 
assaying for T4 it is necessary to ascertain the total T4 
content of the sample and how much free T4 is present as 
well. Uptake tests for thyroid function have been known 
for many years. Generally, this test, which is commonly 
referred to as a thyroid hormone binding assay, provides 
an assessment of the degree of unsaturation of the 
protein binding sites, primarily that of TBG, by thyroid 
hormones and is an indirect index of the patient's 
thyroid status. The tests typically involve the  
 
partitioning of labeled T3 or T4 conjugate between serum 
and a secondary binder which is a function of the binding 
sites on the thyroid binding proteins which are free of 
T4. Many of these tests require a separation step 
to separate the secondary binder from TBG. The tests 
typically require the addition of an external reagent. It is desirable to have an integral uptake test 
for thyroid function which does not require the addition 
of external reagents. The present invention provides a diagnostic 
assay system for the assessment of unoccupied specific 
ligand binding sites on proteins, such as serum proteins 
in biological fluids. The assay is carried out with a 
multilayer assay element and is based on the principle of 
equilibrium distribution in which a ligand distributes 
itself between unoccupied sites on the proteins and the 
remainder of the element. The ligand can be labeled with 
a detectable moiety or it may be unlabeled and detected 
through the use of another detectable species. The impermeability of the layers of the assay 
element to large molecules such as proteins, e.g. TBG, 
keeps these species physically separate from the lower 
layers of the element. The ligand is able to establish 
an equilibrium distribution which is directly 
proportional to the unoccupied sites on the proteins. 
The assay element includes a light-blocking layer which 
is arranged so as to make possible an optical bound/free 
separation of the ligand which is exploited to provide a 
readout signal. In a preferred embodiment the assay system of 
the invention is utilized to provide an indirect estimate 
of the binding sites on TBG which
