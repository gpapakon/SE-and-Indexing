<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superconducting system 
using liquid helium for its operation, and to a permanent 
current switch and a system thereof applied to a superconducting 
system employing a permanent current loop created 
by a superconducting material developing superconductivity 
when cooled.  In a superconducting apparatus utilizing the permanent current 
state, a permanent current switch and a superconducting 
coil are connected to each other for operation. 
However, since superconducting wirings adopted in permanent 
current switches lead to an increase in the electric resistance 
in the OFF state, there is used in many cases a configuration 
in which a multiplicity of superconducting filaments 
are buried in a metal base material having a high 
resistivity such as cupronickel. In such a superconducting 
wiring, the metal base material has quite a low heat conductivity 
as compared with a low-resistance metal such as 
copper. Consequently, even when heat is generated therein 
due to quite a small external disturbance, there locally 
appears a great increase in temperature and hence there is 
likely to occur an abrupt transition to a normal conduction 
state (quenching). In consequence, there have been devised 
many ideas to prevent generation of such an unstableness as 
disclosed, for example, in JP-A-59-96786, JP-A-60-7781, JP-A-60-22383, 
JP-A-60-37790, and JP-A-60-46084. However, 
there has not been obtained a satisfactory stability in the 
present stage. In addition, there has been proposed a technology of fabricating 
a permanent current switch with an oxide superconducting 
material having a high Tc, for example, in JP-A-1-194310, 
JP-A-1-196685, JP-A-1-194310, and JP-A-4-176174. In 
any one of the above cases, considerations have not been 
given to processing of a large amount of heat generated to 
keep the OFF state of the permanent current switch, which  
 
leads to the problem of quite a great loss of liquid 
helium. In each of JP-A-59-96786, JP-A-60-7781, JP-A-60-22383, JP-A-60-37790, 
and JP-A-60-46084 of the prior art, the connecting 
portion is strongly fixed in a mechanical fashion 
to prevent the quenching due to frictionally created heat. 
In such a conventional technology, as a superconducting material 
used in the permanent current switch, there has been 
adopted a substance having a superconducting critical temperature 
(Tc) equal to or less than 20 K, leading hence to 
a reduced temperature margin. In consequence, for a stable 
operation of the permanent current
