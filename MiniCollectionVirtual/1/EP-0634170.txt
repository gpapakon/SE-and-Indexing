<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of 8-hydroxyquinoline 
in free form for the manufacture of a medicament for the 
topical treatment of inflammatory proliferative skin diseases, 
especially psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with the rapid turnover of 
skin cells (hyperproliferation) accompanied by a loss of 
differentiation so that silvery white scales form on the 
surface of the skin. Additionally, the capillaries become 
tortuous and dilated and an inflammatory reaction occurs, 
so that the skin reddens. The elevated silvery white 
scales on a contrasting red background produce the 
unsightly lesions characteristic of psoriasis. A number of methods are used for the topical 
treatment of psoriasis, but none is entirely satisfactory. 
Historically, the earliest form of therapy involved the use 
of coal tar derivatives. These are sometimes effective but 
are extremely messy. Subsequently, the use of dithranol 
(1,8-dihydroxy-9-anthrone) was developed. This substance 
is very effective, but it causes irritation of the skin and 
staining both of the skin and adjacent materials, which are 
disadvantages especially in home treatment. Topical 
corticosteroids have also been used. Although these are 
clean and convenient to use, they are only suppressive in 
action and therefore only provide short term relief of 
symptoms. In addition, psoriasis treated with 
corticosteroids tends to relapse in a more resistant form,  
 
so that more aggressive therapy is later required. The latest form of topical treatment of psoriasis is 
the use of synthetic Vitamin D derivatives. These 
derivatives are reasonably effective but have to be used in 
extremely low concentrations in order to avoid systemic 
calcitropic effects. Thus, it has been shown that 
increasing the concentration of the derivative in the 
composition above 0.005% w/w is liable to cause an increase 
in plasma calcium levels and, even at the 0.005% w/w level 
used in the marketed licensed product, there have been 
reports of increased plasma calcium levels. Such 
preparations moreover rarely clear the psoriasis, perhaps 
because of the very low strength used. Patients therefore 
have to continue treatment for extended periods which 
increases the risk of systemic side effects. Furthermore, 
a significant proportion of patients experience irritation 
and this restricts usage, particularly on delicate areas of 
the skin such as the face. Although it is not known for 
certain, the Vitamin D appears to alter calcium metabolism 
in the epidermal cells, which
