<ABSTRACT>
The auger pump for the continuous conveyance of dust-like and fine-grained bulk materials has a conveyor worm (4) which is mounted on one side and which conveys the bulk material out of an entry space (6), which is under ambient pressure, via a non-return flap (12) arranged at its discharge end, into a pressure chamber (11). Arranged at the discharge end of the conveyor worm (4), between the latter and the non-return flap (12), is a stabilising grating (2) preferably designed as a cross. This stabilising grating or stabilising cross counteracts a rotation of the slug of material downstream of the discharge end of the conveyor worm, that is to say this rotation is prevented in order thereby to reduce the wear of the corresponding components, especially of a dust bush (18) arranged there, and to ensure quiet running along with stable and effective conveyance.
