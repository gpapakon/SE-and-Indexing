<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to purified thermostable DNA polymerases from Pyrodictium 
species, such as Pyrodictium occultum or Pyrodictium abyssi, which polymerases catalyze 

the combination of nucleoside triphosphates to form a nucleic acid strand complementary to a 
nucleic acid template strand. The preferred polymerases are characterized by their ability to 

function efficiently in a polymerase chain reaction, wherein said reaction includes repeated 
exposure to a denaturation temperature of about 100°C. Most preferably the polymerases 

display 5'→3' exonuclease activity, i.e. are proofreading enzymes. The invention also 
provides DNAs encoding the DNA polymerase activity of the said Pyrodictium species, 

which DNAs can be used to construct recombinant vectors and transformed host cells for 

production of polypeptides having said activity. The invention also relates to the preparation 
of said thermostable DNA polymerases, to the use of said polymerases to amplify nucleic 

acids as well as to kits comprising a polymerase of the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermostable DNA polymerases from hyperthermophilic
archael Pyrodictium species and means for isolating and producing the enzymes. Thermostable
DNA polymerases are useful in many recombinant DNA techniques, especially nucleic
acid amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Extensive research has been conducted on the isolation of DNA polymerases from
mesophilic microorganisms such as E. coli. See, for example, Bessman et al., 1957, J.
Biol. Chem. 223:171-177, and Buttin and Kornberg, 1966, J. Biol. Chem. 241:5419-5427.Interest in DNA polymerases from the thermophilic microbes increased with the invention
of nucleic acid amplification processes. The use of thermostable enzymes, such as those
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,165,188, to amplify existing nucleic acid sequences in
amounts that are large compared to the amount initially present was described United States
Patent Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202, which describe the PCR process. These patents are
incorporated herein by reference. The PCR process involves denaturation of a target nucleic
acid, hybridization of primers, and synthesis of complementary strands catalyzed by a DNA
polymerase. The extension product of each primer becomes a template for the production of
the desired nucleic acid sequence. These patents disclose that, if the polymerase employed is
a thermostable enzyme, then polymerase need not be added after every denaturation step,
because heat will not destroy the polymerase activity.The thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus (Taq) has been cloned,
expressed, and purified from recombinant cells as described in Lawyer et at., 1989, J. Biol.
Chem. 264:6427-6437, and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,889,818 and 5,079,352, which are incorporated
herein by reference. Crude preparations of a DNA polymerase activity isolated from
T. aquaticus have been described by others (Chien et at., 1976, J. Bacteriol. 127:1550-1557,
and Kaledin et at., 1980, Biokhimiya 45:644-651).U.S. Patent No. 4,889,818, European Patent Application, Publication No. 258,017,
and PCT Publication No. WO 89/06691, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by
reference, all describe the isolation and recombinant expression of an ∼94 kDa thermostable
DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus and the use of that polymerase in PCR. Although
T. aquaticus DNA polymerase is especially preferred for use in PCR and other recombinant
DNA techniques, a number of other thermophilic DNA polymerases have been purified,
cloned, and expressed.
