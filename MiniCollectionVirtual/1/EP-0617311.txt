<ABSTRACT>
A high definition, high quality active matrix type liquid crystal 
display is provided by excluding electrodes from a single side of two 

transparent substrates to reduce extra space, whilst also providing 
transfers in the remaining space. On the side of liquid crystal inlet 

14, as on other sides, a plurality of transfers 19 are provided outside 
seal 24. From transfers 19 on the side of liquid crystal inlet 14, a 

wiring pattern is formed inwardly, intersecting seal 24, to connect to 
extended conductor 21 formed in parallel with seal 24. Extended 

conductor 21 is led toward the side where signal line lead electrode 18 
is provided, again crossing seal 24 to be connected with transfer lead 

electrode 20 formed on that side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid crystal displays and, more 
particularly, to the arrangement of transfer elements (hereafter called 
"transfers") or electrical contacts as means for supplying counter 
electrode potential for opposing transparent substrates comprising a 
liquid crystal display. The liquid crystal display has two transparent substrates which 
have transparent electrodes, oriented film, and nonlinear elements 
incorporated therein, and have liquid crystal sealed therebetween. 
Voltage is applied across the electrodes on the two transparent 
substrates in order to create a display. In recent years, the mainstream in large liquid crystal displays 
has been the active matrix type, which uses a nonlinear element in each 
pixel. Large scale integrated circuits for driving signal lines which 
are used in the active matrix type liquid crystal display (AM-LCD) have 
been changing their output voltage to that of 5V in order to improve the 
driving rate or lower the cost of LSI chips. To use these 5V LSIs, the 
AM-LCD driving method has also been changing from one which basically 
locks counter electrode potential (Vcom) to a certain reference 
potential, to another which modulates counter electrode potential in 
response to the timing of output signals. For the method of modulating counter electrode potential (Vcom), it 
is necessary to transfer the modulation signal for the transparent 
counter electrode with as short a delay as possible. It is difficult to 
reduce the specific electrical resistance of the transparent counter 
electrode formed of transparent conductor film such as ITO in its forming 
process. Therefore, an increasing number of AH-LCDs have been employing 
a multi-transfer structure with an increased number of transfers, which 
has conventionally been provided only on the four corners of the LCD 
substrate, in order to electrically connect the counter electrode 
substrate to the active matrix substrate in a way which reduces effective 
time delay. This multiple transfer structure is particularly useful in 
large, high definition liquid crystal displays. Figure 1 shows a top view of an active matrix type liquid crystal 
display (AM-LCD) employing a conventional multi-transfer structure. In  
 
many applications, signal lines 17 are drawn alternately upward and 
downward to connect to the "Terminal Anchor Blocks" (TABs) (not shown), 
on which a signal line driving LSI is mounted via signal line lead 
electrodes 18 in order to provide a vertical striped RGB arrangement.
