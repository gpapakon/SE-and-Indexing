<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for the releasable connection of two pipe parts which can be plugged one into the other by one or their ends, in the case of which arrangement the pipe part (1) which can be plugged over the other exhibits an L-shaped cutout (7) which extends from the end edge of the relevant end (6) and whose L-leg (8) running in the axial direction of the pipe part (1) is designed as a plug-in groove for a radially outwardly projecting lug (4) which is provided on the pipe part (2), which can be plugged into the other, and, by rotating the pipe parts (1 and 2) with respect to one another, can be introduced in the L-leg (9) running in the circumferential direction of the pipe part (1), in the case of which arrangement, furthermore, the pipe parts (1 and 2) are secured in the end position of the lug (4) in the relevant L-leg (9) by latching. The pipe parts can be secured in the plugged-together state without additional components in that there is provided on the interconnectable end regions of the pipe parts, for the purpose of mutual latching, in each case at least one latching and counter-latching element which utilises the capacity for radial expansion of the pipe parts.
