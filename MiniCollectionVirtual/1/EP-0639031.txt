<ABSTRACT>
In a system for compressing stereoscopic video signals, 
left and right stereoscopic video image signals are provided by a 

pair of, for example, synchronized cameras (10,11). The left video 
image signal is applied to compression apparatus (12-19) which 

compresses the left video signal according to a flatfield signal 
compression protocol such as the MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts 

Group of the International Standards Organization) moving 
pictures compression protocol. The right video image signal is also 

applied to compression apparatus (23-28) which compresses the 
right video images according to a predictive process wherein the 

predictions are made, at least in part, with respect to images of 
the left video image signal. The compressed left and right image 

signals are conditioned (20,29) for transmission. The compressed 
left image signals may be received by standard receivers for 

reproduction of the left (flatfield) images, and the compressed left 
and right signals may be received by enhanced receivers for 

reproduction of stereoscopic images.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to generating, transmitting and 
receiving compressed video signals for reproducing stereoscopic 
images. Advances in integrated circuit technology and video 
signal compression processes are tending to make the 
transmission and reception of stereoscopic video signals 
economically practical. Nominally, to reproduce real stereoscopic 
images, pairs of right and left images are required. The right and 
left images are produced by separate cameras which are 
separated by a small horizontal distance, such as the average 
distance separating people's eyes. Since the right and left images 
are relatively mutually exclusive, the bandwidth required to 
transmit stereo images would appear to be double the bandwidth 
required to transmit normal flatfield images. The double 
bandwidth channel or two channels of normal bandwidth required 
to transmit a stereo signal is economically, and to some extent 
technically unacceptable. The present invention is a method and apparatus for 
producing and conveying stereoscopic video signals without 
significant increase in transmission bandwidth, and with only 
nominal extra coding and decoding apparatus relative to single 
channel flatfield video systems. As used herein, "flatfield video" 
is meant to connote standard non-stereoscopic video signal. Left and right stereoscopic video image signals are 
provided by a pair of, for example, synchronized cameras. The 
left video image signal is applied to compression apparatus which 
compresses the left video signal according to a flatfield signal 
compression protocol such as the MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts 
Group of the International Standards Organization) moving 
pictures compression protocol. The right video image signal is also 
applied to compression apparatus which compresses the right 
video images according to a predictive process wherein the 
predictions are made, at least in part, with respect to images of 
the left video image signal. The compressed left and right image 
signals are conditioned for transmission. The compressed left 
image signals may be received by standard receivers for  
 
reproduction of the left (flatfield) images, and the compressed left 
and right signals may be received by enhanced receivers for 
reproduction of stereoscopic images. FIGURE 1 is a pictorial diagram of a predictive video 
signal compression process, useful in describing the invention. FIGURES 2, 3 and 4 are pictorial diagrams of 
alternative video signal compression processes embodying the 
invention.
