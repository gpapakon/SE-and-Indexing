<ABSTRACT>
A rotary slide valve (1) for power assisted steering systems of motor vehicles has a rotary slide (2) rotatively guided in a limited manner in a control bushing (3). The control bushing (3) is rotatively linked to a valve output member (7). The rotary slide (2) is linked to the valve output member (7) by a torsion bar (9) and by a dead travel (10). The dead travel coupling (10) consists of a driving profile (16) of the valve output member (7) and of recesses (17) shaped at the free end of the rotary slide (2). The rotary slide (2) is manufactured with its control longitudinal grooves (12, 13) and with its recesses (17) by a non-cutting shaping process. In order to simplify this production process and to reduce the size of the rotary slide valve (1), the recesses (17) of the rotary slide (2) are arranged in the control longitudinal grooves (13) of the rotary slide (2), which are open towards one end.

Rotary slide valve for power-assisted steering systems of 
motor vehicles, having a rotary slide (2) which is 

connected non-rotatably to a valve input member (4), and 
having a control bush (3) which is connected non-rotatably 

to a valve output member (7), 

the valve input member (4) and the rotary slide (2) 
being connected to the valve output member (7) by a 

backlash coupling (10), 
the rotary slide (2) being disposed with rotary 
motion coaxially in the control bush (3) and the two 

parts being rotatable relative to one another at 
most by the rotation angle (18) of the backlash 

coupling (10), 
the control bush (3) having internal and the rotary 
slide (2) having external longitudinal control 

grooves (11, 12, 13), which are partially delimited 
in their axial length and partially open towards at 

least one end and which cooperate with one another 
to direct a pressure medium to and from two working 

chambers of a servomotor, and 
the backlash coupling (10) being formed by a driving 
profile (16) of the valve output member (7) and by 

recesses (17) at the free end of the rotary slide 
(2), into which recesses the driving profile (16) 

engages, 
 
characterized in that the recesses (17) of the backlash 

coupling (10) on the rotary slide (2) together with the 
longitudinal control grooves (12, 13) are manufactured by 

a non-cutting process. 
Rotary slide valve according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the recesses (17) of the rotary slide (2) are formed 

in the longitudinal control grooves (13) of the rotary 
side (2), which are open towards one end.  

 
Rotary slide valve according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the recesses (17) of the rotary slide (2) are 

disposed in the outer peripheral surface of the rotary 
slide (2) between the longitudinal control grooves (13) 

of the rotary slide (2), which are open towards one end. 
Rotary slide valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the rotary slide (2) with its 

longitudinal control grooves (12, 13), its control edges 
and its recesses (17) is manufactured by cold forming. 
Rotary slide valve according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the recesses (17) at the ends of the open 

longitudinal control grooves (13) are wider than the 
longitudinal control grooves (13) in their control 

region. 
Rotary slide valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the longitudinal control grooves 

(13) which are open towards one end are connected to the 
return line leading to a container. 
Rotary slide valve according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the ratio of the total number of 

longitudinal control grooves (12, 13) of the rotary slide 
(2) to the number of recesses (17) is 2:1.
