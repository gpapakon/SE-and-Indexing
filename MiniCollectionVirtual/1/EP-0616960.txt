<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for distributing, loosening and uniformly discharging solid materials on a transporting or conveying belt or other types of moving, sheet-like arrangements, the device being designed to be rotatable in the manner of a roller and exhibiting openings on the roller surface, through which openings the material which is to be distributed can move. The present invention further relates to an method for distributing material and the use of the device, according to the invention, for distributing mixtures of refuse materials.

Device for distributing solid waste materials on conveyors, which is designed as 
a cylindrical apparatus, and can be rotated by a driving engine and consists of 

two disks, which are connected at the circumference by rod-like construction 
elements, which are arranged parallell to the rotation axis in a distance to each 

other, whereby the rod-like construction elements are arranged furthermore in 
such a way that they form the outer surface of the cylindrical apparatus and the 

distances are chosen at least to the extent that the material to be distsributed 
can pass through between the rod-like construction elements, whereby the 

cylindrical device can be adjusted with regard to its altitude and the speed of 
rotation of the cylindrical device is adjustable depending on the load of the 

cylindrical device, on size and kind of the material to be distributed and 
dispersed, on the number of slots between the rod-like construction elements 

and on the transport rate of the feeding conveyer and the removing conveyer, 
the speed of rotating of the cylindrical device amounts to 3 to 100 rotations per 

minute, the width of the cylindrical device is 0,4 to 4 m, preferably 0,8 to 2,5 m, 
the diameter of the cylindrical device is 0,4 to 2,5 m, preferably 0,8 to 2 m, the 

cylindrical device exhibits 3 to 10 rod-like construction elements, a feeding 
conveyer with a transportation rate of 20 mm/sec to 60 mm/sec and a removing 

conveyer with a transportation rate of 0,1 to 2 m/sec is related to the cylindrical 
device and the rod-like construction elements are rotatable rolls. 
Device according to claim 1, charactenzed in that elements exist on the rod-like 
construction elements, which support the distributing operation. 
Device according to claims 1 and 2,characterized in that the rod-like 
construction elements are rotatable rolls with driving engines. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the speed of rotation of the 
rotatable rolls is 50 to 150 rotations per minute. 
Device according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the cylindrical device is 
rotatable in both directions. 
Device according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the elements on the rod-like 
construction elements are disc-like. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the discs are freely rotatable. 
Device according to claims 1 to 7,characterized in that the cylindrical device ist 
adjustable with regard to its altitude.  

 
Device according to claims 1 to 8, characterized in that several cylindrical 

devices are present. 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that the cylindrical device can be 
positioned at variable altitude and horizontal direction. 
Device according to claims 9 and 10, characterized in that the cylindrical 
devices can be variably positioned to each other. 
Use of at least one of the devices of claims 1 to 11, for a steady removal and 
distribution of waste materials on conveyers. 
Process for the distribution of solid materials on conveyers by using at least one 
of the devices according to claims 1 to 11.
