<ABSTRACT>
A refuse receptacle (10) has a receiving container (12) with standing space (20) for individual receptacles (22) which can be tilted and removed forwards and to which there is assigned in each case, below a covering (18), a manual pressing plate (30) which can be pulled forward in sliding guides (40, 58), can be pivoted down in the end position (50), and has at the rear on each side a sliding/rotating bearing (34) and on its underside a pressing body (60) which projects inwards/downwards and whose upper side forms a depression (32) which is accessible from above/outside and is bridged by a gripping strip (78). The pressing body (60) is carried along forwards during the forward tilting by the upper rear edge (68) of the individual receptacle (22). Each individual receptacle (22) is supported at the front by a bottom step (44; 46) on a tilting-bearing rib (54) of a container base (52) and can selectively be tilted by means of a foot pressure strip (26) or a handle (28) and/or can be removed by means of a carrying handle (64). A sealing stop (48) on the front panel (24) at the top rests against the front edge (74) of the covering (18) in the rest position of the receptacle.

A waste container system (10) having a receptacle box (12), which has a 
stowage space (20) limited by walls (14; 16) and a cover (18) for at least one 

individual container (22) is located underneath a compactor (30) and that can 
be tilted forward out of the box front and be removed, wherein said compactor is 

designed as a manual pressing plate (30) that moves forward under said cover 
and in a front limit position (50) swings downwards into said forward-tilted 

individual container (22). 
System according to claim 1, wherein the individual container (22) and the 
manual pressing plate (30) have a substantially oblong basic form whose 

narrow sides face forwards and rearwards into the receptacle box (12) while its 
wide sides are parallel to the side walls (14) of the receptacle box (12). 
System according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said manual pressing plate 
(30) has on either side at the rear a sliding bearing (34) that doubles as a pivot 

bearing in the front limit position (50). 
System according to claim 3, wherein said manual pressing plate (30) has 
sliding grooves (58) with run-out ends (72) on lateral rails (40), said ends (72) 

leaving said rails (40) in the front limit position (50) for enabling the downward 
swing movement of said manual pressing plate (30) about the sliding bearings 

(34). 
System according to claim 3 or claim 4, wherein parallel strips (40), rails or the 
like underneath the cover (18) laterally guide the sliding bearings (34) of the 

manual pressing plate (30). 
System according to any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein the sliding bearings are 
designed as sliding heads (38) that project on both sides of the manual 

pressing plate (30), for example from a rod (36) located on the rear narrow side.  
 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the manual pressing 
plate (30) has on its underside a pressing element (60) projecting 

inwards/downwards. 
System according to claim 7, wherein a recess (32) is provided which is 
accessible from above/outside when the manual pressing plate (30) is moved 

forwards, which preferably forms the upper side of the pressing element (60) 
and which is topped by a handle strip (78). 
System according to claim 7 or claim 8, wherein the pressing element (60) is 
flexible in an inward/downward direction and/or is provided with a stop (70). 
System according to claim 9, wherein the upper rear edge (68) of the individual 
container (22) is disposed relative to the stop (70) in such manner that as the 

individual container (22) is tilted forwards, the manual pressing plate (30) is 
pulled forwards. 
System according to claim 9 or claim 10, wherein the pressing element (60) 
supports or forms said stop (70) at the rear. 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein a front depression (44) 
at the bottom of the individual container (22) serves for supporting it on a rib 

(54) of a pedestal (52) inside the receptacle box (12), said rib (54) acting as a 
tilting bearing. 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein a front plate (24) of the 
individual container (22) has at the top a sealing stop (48) that engages the 

front edge (74) of the cover (18) when the container (22) is in its rest position. 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 13, wherein the individual container 

(22) can be tilted forwards by selectively using a pedal strip (26) or a handle 
(28) and/or be removed using a carrying handle (64). 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 14, wherein the box (12) is 
designed to hold at least two individual containers (22) desposed in a battery 

adjacent to one another. 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 15, wherein the box (12) has a 
swivel bearing (62) for the cover (18) preferably at the top of the rear wall (16).
