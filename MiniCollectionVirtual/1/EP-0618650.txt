<ABSTRACT>
In the case of fibre-optic amplifiers, the input light power is monitored in order to switch off the system in which it is contained, or individual system components, for example the fibre-optic amplifier itself, in the event of deficient input light power. In known fibre-optic amplifiers, a part of the input light power is extracted for this purpose through a coupler. However, these couplers produce disadvantages; for example deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio. In the fibre-optic amplifier according to the invention, a device (4) is used for monitoring the input light power which extracts and evaluates the pumping light not absorbed in the optical waveguide section (2).

<CLAIMS>
A fiber-optic amplifier for amplifying an optical 
signal, comprising a section of optical fiber (2) 

doped with a rare-earth element and having a first 
end(9) and a second end (10), at least one pump-light 

coupler (3) which couples pump light emitted by at 
least one pump-light source (1) into the section of 

optical fiber (2), and at least one device (4) which 
couples out all or part of the pump light still 

present beyond the section of optical fiber (2) as 
viewed in the propagation direction of the pump light, 


characterized in
 that the device (4) 
has processing means connected thereto which turn the 

fiber-optic amplifier off when the pump light still 
present exceeds a threshold. 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the device (4) and the pump-light 

coupler (3) are so connected to the section of 
optical fiber (2) that the section of optical fiber 

(2) is disposed between the device (4) and the pump-light 
coupler (3). 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that the device (4), as viewed in the 

propagation direction of the optical signal, is 
located ahead of the section of optical fiber (2).
