<ABSTRACT>
An ink filling apparatus for filling ink cartridges with a quantity of ink. The ink 
filling apparatus includes ink injecting members (64) or needles (66) to inject ink into an ink 

saturating material or wicking medium contained in the ink cartridges (10). A compression 
member (60) compresses the ink saturating medium while ink is injected into the saturating 

medium. A vent cover covers a vent tube in the ink cartridge (10) and directs the flow of 
pressurized air or gas through the vent tube to prevent ink from entering the vent tube during 

the ink filling operation. A piston pump delivers a specific quantity of ink to the ink filling 
apparatus to accurately fill each ink cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ink cartridges for ink jet printers and more 
particularly to an apparatus and a method for filling ink cartridges with a quantity of ink. In US-A-3,800,496 to Bardet, a machine for testing, filling, and sealing receptacles 
such as fountain pen cartridges is described. A cartridge is filled with a needle which receives 
an ink dose required for filling the cartridge, the ink dose is driven by a piston from a cylinder 
holding the dose. US-A-4,699,054 to Scrudato et al. describes a means for storing and introducing a 
metered supply of ink, to an ink cartridge during the operation of a printing device. Included is 
a bag container for holding ink, a conduit means for conducting ink to the ink cartridge, and a 
needle for penetrating an ink absorbing material contained in the cartridge. One object of the invention is to provide an ink filling apparatus and method for 
filling ink cartridges which strives to eliminate unwanted free ink in and on the cartridge and 
prevents the formation of air bubble foam in the printhead and well region. Accordingly, the present invention provides an ink filling apparatus and method for 
filling ink cartridges according to any one of the appended claims. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for 
filling cartridges with a quantity of ink. The apparatus for filling ink cartridges includes an ink 
injecting member to supply ink to the ink cartridge, a support member to support the ink 
injecting member, a compression member to compress an ink saturating medium held by the 
ink cartridge and an actuating member to move the support member and to thereby move the 
ink injecting member into and out of the cartridge. Pursuant to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for filling a 
chamber of an ink cartridge with a quantity of ink. The method for filling an ink cartridge 
includes the steps of compressing an ink saturating medium, inserting an ink injecting member 
into the ink saturating medium, delivering ink under pressure to the medium, decompressing 
the ink saturating medium, and terminating the deliver of ink to the ink saturating medium. The present invention will be described further by way of examples with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is an elevational view, partially in section, of an ink cartridge. Figure 2 is an elevational view of an ink filling apparatus in accordance with an 
embodiment of the present invention, Figure 3 is a side

<CLAIMS>
An ink filling apparatus for filling ink cartridges (10) with a quantity of ink, the 
cartridge (10) having a housing (12) defining a chamber (14) for the storage of ink, the 

cartridge (10) having a vent member for venting the chamber and an ink saturation medium 
(22) in the chamber (14) for holding the ink, said ink filling apparatus including: 


an ink injecting member (64); 
a compression member (60) to compress the ink saturation medium (22); and 
an actuating member (78) to move said ink injecting member (64) into 
communication with the ink saturation medium to supply ink thereto. 
An ink filling apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said compression member (60) 
defines a first opening to accommodate said ink injecting member (64). 
An ink filling apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said ink injecting 
member comprises a needle member to penetrate the ink saturation medium, said needle 

member being of a sufficient size to fit within the first opening defined by said compression 
member. 
An ink filling apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the first opening defined by 
said compression member is of a size significantly larger than said needle member to provide 

for ink flow through said compression member. 
An ink filling apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein said compression member 
defines a second opening to allow ink to flow through the compression member. 
An ink filling apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said ink 
injecting member comprises a plurality of needle members to penetrate the ink saturation 

medium. 
A method for filling a chamber (14) of an ink cartridge (10) with a quantity of ink, 
including: 


compressing an ink saturating medium (22); 
inserting an ink injecting member (64) into the ink saturating medium (22); 
delivering ink under pressure to the ink saturating medium (22); 
decompressing the ink saturating medium; and  
 
terminating the delivery of ink to the ink saturating medium once the ink saturating 
medium contains a predetermined amount of ink. 
A method as claimed in claim 7, including decompressing the ink saturating medium 
(22) during said delivery step. 
A method as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8, including covering a vent member of the 
ink cartridge before and during the delivery of ink to the ink saturating medium. 
A method as claimed in claim 9, including forcing a gas through the vent member 
and a vent body during said delivery step.
