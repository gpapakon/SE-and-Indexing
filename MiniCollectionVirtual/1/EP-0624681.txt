<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a novel process for 
making a carpet having a secondary backing which is 

substantially impervious to liquids. The process involves 
applying a thermoplastic resin in a film form to the 

surface of a secondary backing fabric or to its underside 
and applying a polymeric latex to the underside of a 

primary backing. The invention also includes carpets made 
from such a process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for 
making a carpet having a secondary backing which is 
substantially impervious to liquids. The process involves 
applying a thermoplastic resin in a film form to the 
surface of a secondary backing fabric or to its underside. 
The invention also encompasses carpets prepared from such 
a process. Many residential and commercial carpets are 
constructed in the following general manner. Carpet pile 
yarn is first inserted through a primary backing fabric to 
form tufts of yarn projecting from the surface of the 
fabric. The primary backing is then coated with a 
polymeric latex to encapsulate the yarn tufts in place and 
to provide an adhesive for a secondary backing fabric. 
The latex-coated primary backing is then bonded to the 
secondary backing to form a laminated backing structure. 
Carpets having such a structure demonstrate good 
dimensional stability, i.e., the carpet generally retains 
its size and shape after being installed in a residence or 
commercial building. Moreover, these carpets have good 
tuft binding strength, i.e., the tufts may not be readily 
pulled from the carpet face. However, one problem with the above-described 
carpets is their susceptibility to liquid penetration. 
For instance, if water or a water-based substance (soda 
pop, coffee, urine, etc.) is spilled onto the carpet face, 
it may permeate through the primary and secondary backings 
and onto the underlying material (carpet underpad, 
hardwood floors, etc.). The underlying material may 
become stained and over a period of time, deteriorate and 
rot.  Those skilled in the trade have considered some 
possible ways for improving the backing structure in order 
to avoid such liquid permeability problems. For instance, Ucci, U.S. Patents 4,643,930 and 
4,579,762, disclose a carpet structure comprising a 
primary backing coated with a latex adhesive composition, 
wherein the primary backing is bonded to a secondary 
backing. The latex adhesive composition contains a 
fluorochemical compound for rendering the primary backing 
substantially impervious to water. Others in the trade have been concerned with 
modifying a carpet backing system in order to improve the 
binding strength and encapsulation of the yarn tufts. For instance, Ballard, U.S. Patent 3,940,525 
describes a process, whereby a tufted primary backing is 
coated with a hot melt adhesive comprising an 
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, wax, and a thermoplastic 
resin. The primary backing is then pressed against a film 
of

A process for constructing a carpet, comprising the steps of: 

a) drawing pile yarn through a primary backing fabric having a 
surface and an underside to form tufts of yarn projecting from the surface of 

the fabric; 
b) applying a latex comprising a synthetic polymer to the underside 
of the primary backing fabric; 
c) applying a thermoplastic polymeric resin in a film form to a 
secondary backing fabric having a surface and an underside, wherein the resin 

is applied to the surface of the fabric; and 
d) bonding the latex-coated underside of the primary backing 
fabric to the resin-applied surface of the secondary backing fabric to form a 

carpet having a secondary backing substantially impervious to liquids. 
A process for constructing a carpet, comprising the steps of:
