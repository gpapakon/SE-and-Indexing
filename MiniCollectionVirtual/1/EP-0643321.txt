<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of first electrodes are disposed on one 
of opposite surfaces of a nonlinear optical material substrate 

which is divided into single domains. Each of the 
first electrodes (11) is made of an electric conductor having a 

width which is equal to or smaller than half the width of a 
designed local inverted-polarization domain. A second electrode (12) 

is positioned on the other of the opposite surfaces in 
confronting relation to the first electrodes. A voltage is 

applied between the first and second electrodes thereby to 
produce local inverted-polarization domains in the nonlinear 

optical material substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling
local polarizations in a nonlinear optical material
which is suitable for use in the formation of a periodically
inverted-polarization structure in an optical second-harmonic
generator (SHG).Second-harmonic generators for converting a radiation
having a fundamental frequency of ω into a radiation
having a second-harmonic frequency of 2ω may be combined with
a semiconductor laser, for example, to provide a short-wavelength
radiation source for converting a near-infrared radiation
into a blue radiation. The short-wavelength radiation
source can increase a wavelength range available for the coherent
radiation produced by the semiconductor laser, and is
effective in giving semiconductor lasers a widened range of
applications and optimizing laser applications in various
fields of art. For example, a shortened laser wavelength allows
optical or magnetooptical recording and reproducing devices
which employ laser beams to increase the recording density
and resolution.The second-harmonic generators include a bulk-type
second-harmonic generator made of KTP, a second-harmonic generator
in the form of an optical waveguide employing a
greater nonlinear optical constant, and a second-harmonic 
generator of the Cerenkov radiation type comprising an optical
waveguide disposed on a single-crystal substrate made of
a nonlinear optical material such as lithium niobate
(LiNbO3), so-called "LN", for guiding a near-infrared radiation
to produce a blue radiation as a second harmonic in a
radiation mode from the single-crystal substrate.The bulk-type second-harmonic generator has a relatively
low SHG conversion efficiency because of its characteristics.
The second-harmonic generator of the Cerenkov radiation
type has practical problems because the second-harmonic
beam is radiated in a direction within the substrate
and the beam spot is of a special shape such as a crescent
shape.For a high conversion SHG efficiency, it is necessary
to confine and guide a fundamental and a second harmonic
within the same waveguide and also to equalize the phase
propagation velocities of the fundamental and the second harmonic.One known process of equalizing the phase propagation
velocities is a quasi-phase matching process which provides
a periodically inverted-polarization structure having
polarizations periodically inverted in the direction in which
radiations are guided in an optical second-harmonic generator.Such a periodically inverted-polarization structure
may be realized by either
