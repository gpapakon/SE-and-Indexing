<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alloy sheet for shadow
mask having high press-formability.Recent up-grading trend of color television toward high
definition TV has employed Fe-Ni alloy containing 34 to 38wt.%
Ni as the alloy for making a shadow mask to suppress color-phase
shift. Compared with low carbon steel which has long been used
as a shadow mask material, conventional Fe-Ni alloy has
considerably lower thermal expansion coefficient. Accordingly, a
shadow mask made of conventional Fe-Ni alloy raises no problem
of color-phase shift coming from the thermal expansion of shadow
mask even when an electron beam heats the shadow mask.Common practice of making the alloy sheet for shadow mask
includes the following steps. An alloy ingot is prepared by
continuous casting process or ingot-making process. The alloy
ingot is subjected to slabbing, hot-rolling, cold-rolling, and 
annealing to form an alloy sheet.The alloy sheet for the shadow mask is then processed usually
in the following steps to form shadow mask. (1) The alloy sheet is
photo-etched to form passage-holes for the electron beam on the
alloy sheet for shadow mask. The alloy sheet for shadow mask
perforated by etching is hereinafter referred to as "flat mask". (2)
The flat mask is subjected to annealing. (3) The annealed flat
mask is pressed into a curved shape of cathode ray tube. (4) The
press-formed flat mask is assembled to a shadow mask which is
then subjected to blackening treatment.Since the shadow mask material of conventional Fe-Ni alloy
prepared by cold-rolling, re-crystallization annealing, and finish-rolling
has higher strength than conventional low carbon steel
shadow mask material, it is softened by softening-annealing
(annealing before pressing) at a temperature of 800°C or higher
temperature for securing the good press-formability after
perforation by etching. The softening at a high temperature of
800°C is, however, not favorable from the view point of work
efficiency and also of economy. Accordingly, the industry waits
for the development of materials which provide a strength as
low as the material having been softened at the temperature of
800°C or higher even if they are subjected to softening at a low
temperature.Improvement of press-formability of an INVAR alloy for
shadow mask was disclosed in the Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 3-267320. This prior art provides a technology to
reduce strength under a low temperature softening annealing at
below 800°C, where an alloy is treated by cold-rolling,
