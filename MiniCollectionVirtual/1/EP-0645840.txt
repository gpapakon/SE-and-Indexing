<ABSTRACT>
Antenna configuration of an electromagnetic detection 
system for detecting and/or identifying detection labels, 

comprising a first and a second antenna array which in 
operation are connected with a transmitter and/or receiver of 

the detection system. The first antenna array comprises a 
plurality of current loops substantially located in one plane, 

which together enclose a surface which at least partly 
overlaps a surface enclosed by a current loop of the second 

antenna array. The second antenna array also comprises a 
plurality of current loops substantially located the plane 

referred to.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna configuration of an
electromagnetic detection system for detecting and/or
identifying detection labels, comprising a first and a second
antenna array, which in operation are connected with a
transmitter and/or receiver of the detection system and are
located at least essentially and substantially in one plane,
the first antenna array comprising a plurality of current
loops.This invention also relates to an electromagnetic
detection system comprising a transmitter and receiver unit
and an antenna configuration coupled thereto.The detection systems referred to typically function as
shoplifting detection systems, which operate, for instance, as
follows: the system generates a magnetic alternating field by
means of the antenna configuration. The frequency of that
alternating field can for instance be varied over a
predetermined frequency interval. A passive detection label,
which comprises a resonance circuit which, for instance,
consists of a coil and a capacitor, will generate a secondary
magnetic alternating field at those moments when an
instantaneous frequency of the field is equal to the resonance
frequency of the label, as soon as this label is introduced
into the field of the antenna configuration. This secondary
magnetic alternating field can subsequently be received by a
receiving antenna which is coupled to a receiver of the
detection system. In a detection system of the absorption
type, this secondary field is received by the same antenna as
the antenna with which the primary field has been generated.
The antenna arrays can be used not only as a transmitting
antenna array, but also as a combined transmitting and
receiving array. In addition, the antenna arrays can be used
as a receiving antenna array. Electromagnetic detection systems comprising antennas
which generate an interrogation field in a detection zone and
which detect a response of a label in the same detection zone
are increasingly becoming subject to electromagnetic
compatibility requirements, EMC requirements for short, which
impose limitations, on the one hand on the electromagnetic
field which the (transmitting) antenna produces at a
substantial distance outside the detection zone and, on the
other, on the sensitivity of the (receiving) antenna to
interfering fields of external sources.A detection array of the type described in the opening
paragraph hereof is disclosed, for instance, in Dutch patent
application 9201270. To meet the above-mentioned problems, in
accordance with the Dutch patent
