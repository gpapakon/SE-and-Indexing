<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a collapsible wing (wing which can be dismantled) for aircraft, especially sports aircraft, it is provided in order to achieve a flight performance similar to that of gliders, on the one hand, and a low weight and packing size on the other hand that the wing consists of a plurality of segments (2) which can be connected to one another, are internally hollow and are dimensioned in such a manner that each individual segment tapers in cross-section towards the outside of the wing (wing tip), the mutually adjacent cross-sections of adjacent segments being of approximately the same size, however, such that the respectively next smaller segments (2) can be pushed into the preceding larger segment (2).

A dismountable wing for aviation equipments, in particular sport flying 
equipments, 
characterized in that
 the wing consists of a plurality of segments 
(2) which are unitable, hollow inside and dimensioned such that each 

individual segment tapers in cross-sectional area towards the tip of the 
wing, the adjoining cross-sectional areas of adjacent segments being however 

of about the same size so that the segment (2) coming next in size can 
be inserted into the preceding greater segment (2). 
A wing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 at least part of the 
segments (2) are additionally separable in a direction approximately parallel 

to the longitudinal axis of the wing. 
A wing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each segment (2) is 
a self-supporting shell element. 
A wing according to claim 1, comprising an arrangement for the positive 
union of in particular of segments of thin-walled hollows at right angles to 

the longitudinal extension of the segments, 
characterized by
 a flangelike 
projection (5) disposed in the vicinity of each face of the segments and extending 

at least in sections around the outside edge of the faces and radially 
projecting from the surface of the segments, the projection (5) being such 

that in the vicinity of the face, it bears positively against a corresponding 
projection (5) of the respectively adjacent segment (2) and that it is assigned 

a rear recess (9') where turned away from the face such that a clamp 
(10) is slippable in the longitudinal direction of the projections (5) from an  

 
end or an interspace of the projections (5) in such a way that corresponding 

lugs (11) on either side of the clamp (10) engage with the rear recesses. 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the clamp (5) is inherently 
elastic in the longitudinal direction such that when slipped on, it 

can trace the curvature of the faces of the segments (2) to be united and is 
simultaneously clamped. 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 a plurality of clamps 
is slipped on in a zipper-like manner from one outside of the cross-sectional 

profile. 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the projections (5'') 
have interspaces (12), of which the length corresponds at least to the length 

of the clamps (10''), so that the latter can be placed where an interspace 
(12) is provided and be slipped on to the projections (5''). 
A wing according to claims 4 and 7, 
characterized in that
 the projections 
(5'') widen and/or thicken by an acute angle in their longitudinal direction 

and that the clamps (10'') narrow and/or taper correspondingly by 
an acute angle, which results in wedging when the clamps (10'') are slipped 

on. 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the faces of the 
projections (5) are profiled such that the faces of adjacent projections (5, 

5c) mesh positively.  
 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the clamping devices 
for arresting the clamps (10) in the longitudinal direction of the projections 

(5) and/or for clamping the positively united segments (2) are provided 
in the direction of the latter's longitudinal axis. 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the rear recess (9') 
is formed on the wing segment (2) at a distance from the projections (5). 
A wing according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the rear recesses 
are formed below the surface of the segments (2) to be united and that the 

segment surfaces adjoin substantially flush, the clamps (10) being insertable 
through openings.
