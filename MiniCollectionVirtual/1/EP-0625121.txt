<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device located at a downwards step (20), between a first and a second conveyor path (1, 23), at which a first overlapping article stream (2) is fanned out and transferred to form a second deflected overlapping article stream (3). Located before and after the downwards step (20) are pressure rollers (5, 10) which press against the upper surfaces of the first and second stream (2, 3), respectively, and which represent means for directing the second stream (3). The invention thus ensures compactness and precision in the change in direction of the diverted stream (3) without the need for a lateral guide wall.
