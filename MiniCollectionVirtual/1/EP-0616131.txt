<ABSTRACT>
In the case of conventional radial wheels, the outside diameter of the blade ring between hub disc and cover disc is constant. The problem here is that the flow rate decreases greatly in the vicinity of the cover disc. As a result, efficiency and power density of the wheel are impaired. Wheels are also already known, in the case of which the diameter of the blade ring increases from the hub disc to the cover disc by about 10.5 to 35 %. According to calculations of the inventor, undesired shear flows here, involving considerable losses, can be avoided only by twisting the blades. For the manufacture of twisted blades, complicated special tools are required, so that a single-piece or small-series production is not economical as a rule. The new wheel has blades (3) which are simple to manufacture and are plane or cylindrically curved. An increase in the efficiency and power density is achieved in that the diameter of the blade ring on the cover disc (2) is 1 to 6 % greater than on the hub disc (1). The wheel is particularly suitable for single-piece or small-series production.

A radial wheel, 

with a hub disc (1), 
with an annular cover disc (2) formed to resemble a trumpet, 
and with a blade ring, comprising several flat or cylindrically curved blades (3) which are 
fastened by simple connections, such as welding, rivet or plug connections, to the hub 

disc (1) and the cover disc (2), 
characterised in that the external diameter of the blade ring on the cover disc (2) is 1 to 
6 % larger than the external diameter of the blade ring on the hub disc (1). 
A radial wheel according to Claim 1, characterised in that the external diameter of the 
blade ring between the hub disc (1) and an intermediate plane (4) parallel to the hub disc 

increases steadily and is constant between the intermediate plane and the cover disc (2), 
the intermediate plane (4) dividing the distance between the hub disc (1) and the cover 

disc (2) in the ratio of at least 7:3. 
A radial wheel according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the hub disc (1) is flat. 
A radial wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the tangent to 
the cover disc (2) extends in a radial manner to the external edge thereof.
