<DESCRIPTION>
 REMOTE-CONTROLLED SYSTEM FOR TREATING EXTERNAL SURFACES OF BUILDINGSFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to remotely-controlled systems fortreating external surfaces of buildings and, more particularly, to remotely-controlled systems which make it possible to paint, wash and carry outother treatments of the outside of a building, including the outside of itswindows.Tall buildings are quite commonplace, especially in heavilypopulated areas. The external surfaces of such buildings must occasionallybe treated for aesthetic and/or functional reasons. For example, it isdesirable to periodically clean the outside surfaces of the building windows,which windows often form an integral part of the building exterior andcannot be accessed from inside the building. It may alsov from time to timebe desirable to clean surfaces other than the windows. Similarly, it maybe desired to paint or otherwise coat portions of the exterior surface ofbuildings.A number of techniques are used in order to gain access to thebuilding exterior for the purpose of effecting any of the above-mentionedtreatments, among others. A very small fraction of buildings are designedwith external access ways surrounding each floor which can accommodatea worker. However, the vast preponderance of buildings, for reasons ofcost and/or architectural aesthetic considerations, do not feature such access 

ways.To treat the external surfaces of buildings lacking external accessways, one normally relies on scaffolding capable of accommodating one ormore workers. For large undertakings, such as the repainting of theexterior of a building, weeks may be required to erect the necessaryscaffolding.For smaller jobs, such as the cleaning of exterior windows, a smallscaffold platform may be supported by cables which are attached to anappropriate securing device secured at the roof of the building. A motorlocated on the roof or on the platform is used to raise and lower thescaffold platform. The securing device can be moved as necessary to theappropriate location on the roof so as to allow access of workers on theplatform to the precise portion of the building exterior to be treated. Somebuildings feature a series of permanently installed securing devices locatedat desired locations along the roof, which obviates the need to move andredeploy a mobile anchoring device.A difficulty shared by all the above-described techniques is that eachrequires a worker to work in the immediate vicinity of the portion of theexterior surface of the

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A system for treating an external surface of a building,
comprising:
(a) a rigid vertical supporting member;
(b) a connector mounted onto said supporting member and
slidable along said supporting member;
(c) first driving means for moving said connector along said
supporting member;
(d) treatment means movably connected to said connector for
treating the surface;
(e) second driving means for moving said treatment means
parallel to and perpendicular relative to the surface of the
building;
(f) means for securing said supporting member to the building
and said supporting member extending from ground level to
said securing means;
(g) means for anchoring to the ground said supporting member;
(h) means for controlling said first driving means;
(i) means for controlling said second driving means; and
(k) means for guiding said treatment means properly oriented
with respect to the surface of the building. 


 2. A system as in claim 1 wherein said supporting member is
made up of a plurality of detachably connected modules.
3. A system as in claim 1 wherein said supporting member is
of polygonal cross section.
4. A system as in claim 1 wherein said treatment means includes
a working head.
5. A system as in claim 4 wherein said treatment means is
capable of moving said working head in all directions parallel to and
perpendicular to the surface. v
6. A system as in claim 4 wherein said treatment means is
capable of orienting said working head at various angles.
7. A system as in claim 1 wherein said guiding system includes
a vertical guide wire to which said treatment means can be detachably
connected.
8. A system as in claim 1 wherein said first driving means 


includes a wire and a winch.
9. A system as in claim 1 wherein said treatment means is
capable of cleaning.
10. A system as in claim 1 wherein said treatment means is
capable of painting.
11. A system as in claim 1 wherein said treatment means is
capable of sandblasting.
12. A system as in claim 1 wherein said treatment means is
capable of plastering.
13. A system as in claim 1 wherein said treatment means is
capable of applying protective coating.
