<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a method for torque limiting during soft starting of a three-phase asynchronous motor (15) by means of thyristor controllers (11, 12, 13) in each of the three phases (L1, L2, L3) whose power is set by phase gating via the triggering angle of the thyristors. The invention comprises the three-phase asynchronous motor (15) being operated (driven) via a control loop which contains the thyristor controllers (11, 12, 13), and the power detection in at least one phase (L1, L2, L3) being used for control.

Method for torque limitation during the gentle running-up of a polyphase 
alternating current asychronous motor (15) by means of thyristors which 

are connected into regulating thyristor members (11, 12, 13) in each of 
the three phases (L1, L2, L3), wherein the polyphase alternating 

current asynchronous motor (15) is operated in a regulating loop 
containing the regulating thyristor members (11, 12, 13) and the supply 

of the polyphase alternating current asynchronous motor (15) is 
regulated by phase section by way of the control angle of the 

thyristors, characterised thereby, that the real power is detected in at 
least one phase (L1, L2, L3) and regulated to a constant value during 

the gentle running-up.
