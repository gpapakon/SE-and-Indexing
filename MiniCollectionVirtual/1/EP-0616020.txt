<DESCRIPTION>
This is a divisional application from EPC application 90104771.2 
(EP-A-0388768) which claims a novel 
electroluminescence (EL) device and more particularly an 
organic EL device capable of emitting light in a region of 
bluish purple to green at a high luminance and in a 
stabilized manner. The present invention relates 
to a novel aromatic dimethylidyne compound useful, for 
example, as an emitting material for an EL device, and a process 
for efficiently preparing the above compound. A device utilizing EL performance of an organic compound 
has been long studied in view of fluorescence of the organic 
compound. For example, W. Helfrish, Dresmer, Williams et al. 
succeeded in emission of blue light using anthracene crystal 
(J. Chem. Phys., 44, 2902 (1966)). Vincett, Barlow, et al. 
produced a light emitting device by a vapor deposition 
method, using a condensed polycyclic aromatic compound (Thin 
Solid Films, 99, 171 (1982)). However, only a light emitting device low in luminance 
and luminous efficiency has been obtained. It is reported that emission of blue light of 100 cd/m² 
was obtained using tetraphenylbutadiene as a light emitting 
material (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.  
 
194393/1984). In practice, however, the efficiency is 
markedly low and is unsatisfactory. It is reported that a green light emitting organic thin 
film EL device providing the maximum luminance of more than 
1,000 cd/m² and an efficiency of 1 lm/W was developed by 
laminating a diamine compound conveying a hole and a luminous 
aluminum chelate complex as a light emitting material (Appl. 
Phys. Lett., 51, 913 (1987)). It is also reported that a distyrylbenzene compound well 
known as a laser dye exhibits high fluorescent properties in 
the region of blue to blue green, and a light emitting 
material using the distyrylbenzene compound in a single layer 
form emits EL light of about 80 cd/m² (European Patent 
0319881). However, a light emitting material providing light other 
than green light (particularly blue-based light) in a 
luminance as high as more than 1,000 cd/m² and with high 
efficiency has not been obtained. In connection with the structure of the aforementioned 
organic EL device, those obtained by propertly providing a 
hole injection layer or an electron injection layer onto a 
basic structure of positive electrode/light emitting 
layer/negative electrode, e.g., a structure of positive 
electrode/hole injection layer/light emitting layer/negative 
electrode, or a structure of positive
