<ABSTRACT>
A gym shoe having an upper 
portion of any material and a sole of 

any material characterized in that a 
pad containing a bouncing putty is 

provided on the inner side of a reinforcement 
member formed of a hard 

material, thus providing superior fittingness 
and stability. The reinforcement 

member is a cup-like stabilizer 
or a heel counter. It is preferable 

to use a foam impregnated with a 
bouncing putty as the pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sports shoe having more specifically 
an improved heel-holding 
capability to stabilize the heel of the foot. For purposes of preventing excessive pronation and supination of 
the foot occuring in walking and running, a conventional sports 
shoe includes a heel counter consisting of a board of synthetic 
resin or resin-impregnated leather and inserted between an upper 
and a lining at the periphery of the heel portion of the shoe, and a 
stabilizer having a reinforcing wall positioned on the side of the 
heel portion to reinforce the heel counter. The stabilizer has a particular shape for one of various shoes as 
shown in Figure 12 of the accompanying drawings and therefore, it 
has been found that due to individual difference, the stabilizer 
fits the heel of one wearer but does not fit the heel of the other 
wearer. In the former case, the stabilizer can firmly stably hold 
the heel of the foot in running because of stiffness of resin from 
which the stabilizer is formed, thereby preventing rolling of the 
heel. In the latter case, however, the heel of the foot is unstable 
in the shoe and the wearer might have a shoe sore caused by  
 
touching the stabilizer having a relatively high stiffness. The 
wearer might also suddenly sprain the ankle of the foot and be 
subject to impedimenta to the ankle, knee, waist and the like in a 
prolonged use of the shoe. For purposes of fitness of the heel portion of the shoe, it has 
been known to employ a cup-like stabilizer shaped curvedly from a 
heel-treading portion toward a reinforcing wall thereof to conform 
to the shape of the heel. This can attain a certain degree of 
improvement in fitness but still makes it impossible to accommodate 
the individual difference so that more complete stability of the 
heel can not be accomplished. Japanese patent public disclosure Sho 50-1855 and Japanese patent 
public disclosure Heisei 4-117903 disclose sports shoes each 
employing bouncing putty plastically deformed easily when a stress 
is applied more slowly and exhibiting a high degree of bounce under 
suddenly applied stresses in order to more improve the fitness of 
the heel portion of the shoe. In the invention described in each of the publications, the 
bouncing putty is contained in a pad adhesively secured to a midsole 
of soft elastic material and a soft upper. With this arrangement, 
pressure from the heel of a wearer is liable to escape through the 
pad to the midsole and the upper so that the pad can not be 
plastically deformed

<CLAIMS>
A sports shoe comprising an upper member (5, 15) of any suitable materials 
and a sole (6, 7) of any suitable materials, 
characterized
 by a bouncing 
putty-containing pad (8) positioned on the inner surface of a reinforcing 

element (1a, 1b, 16a, 16b) having a higher hardness than that of the upper 
member and the sole, said pad (8) comprising an open-cell foam 

impregnated with the bouncing putty.

characterized in that
 said cup-like 
stabilizer (1a, 1b) has a recess (3) formed therein to position the pad (8). 
A sports shoe according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said reinforcing 
element comprises a heel counter (16a, 16b) interposed between the upper 

(5) and a lining (15) of the shoe. 
A sports shoe according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said reinforcing 
element comprises a heel counter (16a, 16b) connected to the upper (5) at 

the heel region of the shoe.

characterized in that
 said heel 
counter (16a, 16b) has a recess (3) formed therein to position said pad (8). 
A sports shoe according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 
said pad (8) comprises a bag-like sheet member enclosing the bouncing 

putty therein.
