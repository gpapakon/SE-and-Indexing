or a salt thereof which provide an extended duration of 
pain relief of about 24 hours, have a dissolution rate in-vitro

Method of 100 rpm in 900 ml aqueous buffer at 37°C from 

about 12.5% to about 42.5% (by weight) active agent released 
after 1 hour, from about 25% to about 55% (by 

weight) active agent released after 2 hours, from about 45% 
to about 75% (by weight) opioid analgesic released after 4 

hours and greater than about 60% (by weight) opioid analgesic 
released after 8 hours, the in-vitro release rate 

being substantially independent of pH and chosen such that 
the peak plasma level of active agent obtained in-vivo

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid, controlled-release 
oral dosage form for use in the treatment of pain. It is the intent of all controlled (slow) release 
formulations to provide a longer period of pharmacologic 
action after administration than is ordinarily obtained 
after administration of immediate-release dosage forms. 
Such longer periods of response provide for many therapeutic 
benefits that are not achieved with corresponding short 
acting, immediate release preparations. Thus, therapy may 
be continued without interrupting the sleep of the patient, 
which is of special importance, for example, when treating 
a patient for moderate to severe pain (e.g., a post-surgery 
patient, a cancer patient, etc.), or for those patients who 
experience migraine headaches on awakening, as well as for 
the debilitated patient for whom sleep is essential. Unless conventional rapid acting drug therapy is 
carefully administered at frequent intervals to maintain 
effective steady state blood levels of the drug, peaks and 
valleys in the blood level of the active drug occurs because 
of the rapid absorption, systemic excretion of the 
compound and through metabolic inactivation, thereby producing 
special problems in maintenance therapy of the 
patient. A further general advantage of longer acting drug 
preparations is improved patient compliance resulting from 
the avoidance of missed doses through patient 
forgetfulness. Morphine, which is considered to be the prototypic 
opioid analgesic, has been formulated into 12 hour controlled-release 
formulations (i.e., MS Contin® tablets, 
commercially available from Purdue Frederick Company). It has previously been known in the art that controlled-release 
compositions of opioids or salts thereof 
could be prepared in a suitable matrix. For example, in  
 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,990,341 and 4,844,909 (Goldie, et al.), 
both assigned to the assignee of the present invention, describes 
hydromorphone compositions wherein the dissolution 
rate in-vitro of the dosage form, when measured by the USP 
Paddle or Basket Method at 100 rpm in 900 ml aqueous buffer 
(pH between 1.6 and 7.2) at 37° C, is between 12.5 and 
42.5% (by wt) hydromorphone released after 1 hour, between 
25 and 55% (by wt) released after 2 hours, between 45 and 
75% (by wt) released after 4 hours and between 55 and 85% 
(by wt) released after 6 hours, the in-vitro release rate 
being independent of pH between pH 1.6 and 7.2 and chosen 
such that the peak plasma level of hydromorphone obtained

<CLAIMS>
A solid, controlled release, oral dosage form, 
the dosage form comprising an analgesically effective 

amount of an opioid analgesic or a salt thereof, coated 
with a controlled-release coating or in a controlled-release 

matrix, wherein the dissolution rate in-vitro of 
the dosage form, when measured by the USP Paddle Method at 

100 rpm at 900 ml aqueous buffer (pH between 1.6 and 7.2) 
at 37° C is from about 12.5% to about 42.5% (by wt) opioid 

released after 1 hour, from about 25% to about 65% (by wt) 
opioid released after 2 hours, from about 45% to about 85% 

(by wt) opioid released after 4 hours and greater than 60%
