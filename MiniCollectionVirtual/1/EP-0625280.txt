<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to conducting
polymers, and more particularly relates to electrically
conductive, shaped articles such as parts, containers,
fibers, tapes, films and coatings of colored polyaniline
and to methods of forming and use of same conductive
articles.Electrically conductive, thermoplastic polymer
compounds are of increased practical interest, for
instance, for packaging electronic instruments and parts,
and to solve a wide range of static decay, static
shielding and electromagnetic shielding problems. Often
such compounds are made by mixing, for example, carbon
black, stainless steel fibers, silver or aluminum flakes
or Nickel-coated fibers with insulating bulk
thermoplastics such as polystyrene, polyolefins, nylons,
polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butene styrene (ABS)
copolymers, etc. These filled compounds are subsequently
processed into the desired shapes and articles by
extrusion, injection or blow molding and the like. Major
problems associated with the above filled thermoplastic
compounds are that processing of these materials is not
trivial, is often associated with excessive machine wear
and that their colorability is difficult due to the
mechanical and optical properties of the fillers,
respectively. For example, it is virtually impossible to
produce carbon black filled polymers having a high 
electrical conductivity that are not black. The
importance of colorability of conductive compounds
derives from applications of these materials in, for
instance, the carpet and fashion industry where product
appearance is critical, and for color coding of films,
containers, housings and enclosures.More recently, there has been an increased
interest in replacing the carbon black or metal filled
compounds with intrinsically electrically conductive
polymers and their blends with common insulating
polymers. The latter systems are believed to be more
cost competitive, easier to process and to exhibit
desirable mechanical properties. Among the various
conductive polymers, the polyanilines have attracted
particular attention because of their excellent
environmental stability and their low production costs.Polyaniline is well known in the art, and the
preparation of the electrically conductive form of this
polymer based on, for example, contacting polyanilines
with protonic acids has been disclosed. Green, A.G., and
