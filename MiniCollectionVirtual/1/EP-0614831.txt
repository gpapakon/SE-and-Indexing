<ABSTRACT>
A chain conveyor, wherein the annular elements of 
one of the chains (20, 21) are connected to 

corresponding annular elements of the other chain by 
means of cross bars (22) directly supported and 

guided by longitudinal slide elements (23, 24) 
arranged parallel along the path of the belt (12); 

elements (32, 33') are also provided for the lateral 
centering of the belt (12), arranged on one side of 

at least one of the chains (20, 21) of the belt (12) 
along all or part of the guide path, in particular 

along curved sections and at drive devices (16) of 
the chains (20, 21) of the belt (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chain conveyor of
the type comprising an endless conveyor belt sliding
along guide means which develop along a
predetermined path, wherein the conveyor belt
comprises a first and a second drive chain formed by
annular elements. The annular elements of one chain
are connected to corresponding annular elements of
the other chain by means of cross bars defining the
surface of the conveyor belt. Drive means are also
provided, comprising at least one drive wheel which
drives a chain of the belt.
Document US-A-3237756 discloses such a conveyor. The preamble of
claim 1 is based on this prior art.Chain conveyors, of the abovementioned type, are
widely used in a number of areas due to their
intrinsic features which allow them to support heavy
loads and to operate in different environments.
In general, in chain conveyors of the known type,
the whole conveyor belt is supported and guided by
means of the same drive chains which slide along
guide channels which surround part of the profile of 
the chain itself. Consequently chain conveyors of
this type have a number of disadvantages due to
their structure and the consequent manner of
supporting and guiding the conveyor belt.More particularly, the use of belt guide and slide
elements in the form of a channel, or such as to
surround substantially most of the profile of the
rings of the chains, causes considerable dragging
friction, not only due to the large surface of
contact with the chains, but also to the additional
friction caused by structural and assembly defects
of the various parts which make up the system. In
addition to the deformations caused by welding the
cross bars to the chains, the inevitable
irregularities of shape and size of the rings may
cause greater friction against the guide surfaces
and consequently require the use of more powerful
drive assemblies, particularly for conveyors which
develop along paths of considerable length or with
extremely complex or spiral paths.A further disadvantage consists in the excessive
weight of the conveyor belt, due to the fact that
the chains had to be dimensioned to resist the high 
drive stresses and due to the need to use cross bars
with a considerable section in order to prevent
their deformation and that of the conveyor belt
itself on account of the long support distance of
the bars, particularly in belts of greater width.
Moreover, bars of greater section create once again
greater weight for the belt to drive.Furthermore, in known conveyors of the aforesaid
type, in an
