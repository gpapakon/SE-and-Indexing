<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for encoding a stream of databits of a binary
source signal into a stream of databits of a binary channel signal, wherein the bitstream
of the source signal is divided into n-bit source words, which device comprises
converting means adapted to convert said source words into corresponding m-bit
channel words. The invention also relates to a device for decoding a stream of data bits
of a binary channel signal obtained by means of the encoding device, so as to obtain a
stream of databits of a binary source signal, and to a record carrier.An encoding device mentioned in the foregoing is known from the book
'Coding techniques for digital recorders' by K.A. Schouhamer Immink, chapter 5.6.7,
pp. 127 to 131, Prentice Hall (1991). The book discusses an encoder for generating a
(d,k) sequence which satisfies the parameters: rate 2/3, (1,7), which encoder is also
proposed by Cohn et al in USP 4,337,458. The known encoding scheme suffers from
the presence of a DC level which may become excessively large and therefore
introduces distortion in communication systems which can not handle a DC component,
as well as distortion in any recording of data in magnetic media.The invention has for its object to provide a device for encoding n-bit source
words into corresponding m-bit channel words, such that it itself does not generate a
DC component in the channel signal, whereas further it provides the possibility, by
means of additional measures to be taken, to realize a channel signal in the form of a
(d,k) sequence.The device in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the
converting means are adapted to convert a block of p consecutive n-bit source words
into a corresponding block of p consecutive m-bit channel words, such that the
conversion for each block of p consecutive n-bit source words is parity preserving,
where n, m and p are integers, m > n ≥ 1, p ≥ 1, and where p can vary.
'Parity preserving' means that the parity of the n-bit source words to be converted equal 
the parity (after modulo-2 addition) of the corresponding m-bit channel words in which
they are converted. As a result, the n-to-m conversion device as claimed does not
influence the polarity of the signal. The conversion is such that, by itself, it does not
generate a DC component in the channel signal.The encoding device in accordance with the invention can be used in
combination with a bit-adder unit in which one bit is added to codewords of a certain
length. The signal obtained can be applied to the
