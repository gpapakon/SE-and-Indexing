<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an aqueous 
pharmaceutical suspension composition containing suspended 

acetaminophen and at least one additional pharmaceutical 
active, a suspension system containing xanthan gum, a 

mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium 
carboxymethylcellulose and an auxiliary suspending agent 

selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethyl-cellulose 
and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of 

carboxymethylcellulose, an effective amount of a taste-masking 
composition; and water, as well as a process for 

producing such aqueous pharmaceutical suspensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous 
pharmaceutical suspensions and, more particularly, to 
aqueous suspensions containing suspended acetaminophen, at 
least one additional pharmaceutical active, a suspending 
system and a taste-masking composition. This invention 
also relates to a process for preparing such suspensions. Orally administered drugs are provided to the patient 
in many dosage forms, including solid forms such as 
capsules, caplets or tablets and liquid forms such as 
solutions, emulsions or suspensions. Pharmaceuticals 
administered in solid form are usually intended to be 
swallowed whole. The disagreeable taste of the drug is 
generally not of concern when formulating swallowable 
dosage forms, because the pharmaceutical's taste can be 
easily masked with an exterior coating. Children, older persons, and many other persons 
including disabled or incapacitated patients often have 
trouble swallowing tablets or capsules. In these 
situations, it is desirable to provide the drug either in 
a chewable solid form or a liquid form. For many 
patients, including pediatric and geriatric patients, a 
liquid oral dosage form is preferred over a chewable 
dosage form. A liquid dosage is especially preferred for  
 
this class of patients because of the ease with which it 
may be swallowed. Additionally, patients may be more 
inclined to comply with their medication instruction if 
the dosages are easier to ingest. However, a common problem associated with liquid 
pharmaceutical dosage forms is the often disagreeable 
taste of a drug that may manifest itself when the drug is 
in the liquid dosage form. Sometimes, the taste of the 
drug in the dosage form may be overpowered by adding 
sweeteners or flavoring agents to the formulation. These 
agents mask the bitter or unpleasant taste of drugs. 
However, these agents are not totally effective in 
concealing the unpalatable taste of the pharmaceutical. Liquid suspension dosage forms have stability 
problems associated with maintaining the drugs in 
suspension. Poorly formulated liquid pharmaceutical 
suspensions allow the drug to settle out as a sediment and 
may not properly redisperse, thereby affecting the 
therapeutic concentration of drug in the suspension. This 
may result in underdosing or overdosing of the patient, 
which may seriously compromise the patient's recovery. If the liquid dosage form is a combination product 
containing both dissolved and suspended solid 
pharmaceutical actives, one active must remain suspended 
and the other

<CLAIMS>
A pharmaceutical suspension, comprising: 
   a therapeutic effective amount of suspended 

acetaminophen; 
   a therapeutic effective amount of at least one 

additional pharmaceutical active selected form the group 
consisting of antitussives, expectorants, antihistamines, 

sympathomimetics, and mixtures thereof; 
   a suspending system consisting essentially of about 

0.1 to about 0.25 gram per 100 mL of the suspension of 
xanthan gum, about 0.4 to about 1.0 gram per 100 mL of the 

suspension of a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and 
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and an auxiliary suspending 

agent selected from the group consisting of about 0.01 to 
0.10 gram per 100 mL of the suspension of a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt of carboxymethylcellulose 
and about 0.1 to about 1.0 gram per 100 mL of the 

suspension of hydroxyethylcellulose; 
   water; and 

   an effective amount of a taste-masking composition to 
provide a palatable taste to said suspension. 
The pharmaceutical suspension of claim 1 wherein the 
auxiliary suspending agent comprises sodium carboxymethylcellulose 
The pharmaceutical suspension of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the 
at least one additional pharmaceutical active is an 

antihistamine selected from the group consisting of
