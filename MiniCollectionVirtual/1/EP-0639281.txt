<ABSTRACT>
A new kind of joint is disclosed, in particular for securing side pieces spectacles to the mount of spectacles, which is capable of conferring to the bows an appropriate elasticity, both when they are braced over the temples and when they are opened or closed, so that they are not limited by any problems of size. The characteristic trait of the joint is that it has a forked part or a forked spring (11 or 111), the ends (112, 114) of which have inner surfaces provided with teeth (122, 123, 124, 125) or grooves (16, 17) with slanting walls shaped so that they stand at right angles to each other and are concentrically arranged around a transverse joint pin (19, 119) linked to a second part inserted between both fork ends (112, 114). Said part is fixed to the mount (18, 118) of the spectacles and allows both parts to rotate, pressing apart the ends (12, 14 or 112, 114) of the fork, achieving the desired elasticity when the parts are rotated.

Flexural pivot for side pieces of spectacles with a 
fork spring and a joint pin, wherein 


a) the fork spring (11) has teeth (122, 123, 124, 
125) or grooves (16, 17) at the internal surfaces of 

its fork ends (12, 14) or at small plates (13, 15) 
being disposed thereat, which are arranged 

rectangular to each other and coaxial to an axis of a 
joint pin (19) of the fork ends (12, 14), 
b) the spectacles side piece (18) being inserted 
between the fork ends (12, 14) and rested in the 

grooves (16, 17), wherein the spectacles side piece 
(18) can be rotated around the joint pin (19) so that 

the seating of the spectacles side piece is 
changeable from the groove (17) to the next groove 

(16) being rectangular to the previous, and 
c) the fork ends (12, 14) are formed spreadable to 
permit a further rotation of the spectacles side 

piece (18), wherein the fork ends relieve the change 
of the seating of the spectacles side piece (18) in 

one of the grooves (16, 17) by exerting an adequate 
pressure on the spectacles side piece (18) in the 

intermediate phase from one groove to another. 
Flexural pivot according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the joint consists of the fork spring (11) at 

which a linking piece (5) for mounting on a 
spectacles frame (2) is disposed at one of the fork 

ends (12 or 14), wherein the opposed internal 
surfaces of the fork ends (12, 14), or small plates 

(13, 15) being disposed on these ends, have grooves  
 

(16, 17) which are arranged rectangular to each other 
and concentric to the axis of a joint pin or screw 

(19) which is insertable in a bore-hole being 
disposed in the fork ends (12, 14), wherein the axis 

of the screw (19) is aligned corresponding to the 
slide planes of the grooves (16, 17). 
Flexural pivot according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that between the internal surfaces of the fork ends 

(12, 14) of the elastic element (11), or between the 
same internal surfaces of the small plates (13, 15) 

being disposed on these ends, an end of the 
spectacles side piece (18) is insertable, wherein the 

spectacles side piece (18) has a width and is 
reposable in one of the grooves (16, 17) in such a 

manner, that at its spectacles side piece end, 
arranged coaxial to the bore-holes at the fork ends 

(12, 14), a corresponding bore-hole is provided 
taking up the joint pin or the screw (19), which is 

insertable through the same bore-holes of the fork 
ends and which is screwable in a threaded hole being 

provided in the lower fork end (14) or in a 
subsequent disposed nut, so that the spectacles side 

piece (18) is pivotally fixed. 
Flexural pivot according to Claims 2 and 3,
 
characterized in that the spectacles side-piece (18), 

which is pivotally disposed by the screws (19) and 
engaged in one of the grooves (16, 17), can be 

pivotally engaged into the next rectangular disposed 
groove (17 or 16), and that a stop (20) is provided 

to which the side piece can be rotated further within 
limits, causing during this rotary phase a straddling 

of the fork ends (12, 14) or small plates (13, 15) 
being fixed to these ends, and that by the action of 

its width on the opposed internal surfaces of the  
 

fork ends (12, 14), whereby the fork spring (11) is 
stressed. 
Flexural pivot according to Claims 2 to 4,
 
characterized in that a pressure is exerted by the 

stress on the fork spring (11) over the fork ends 
(12, 14) on the end of the spectacles side piece 

(18), so that it snaps into the next groove, whereby 
a flying open or snapping of the side pieces (18) on 

the spectacles is made possible and an adequate 
pressure of the side pieces on the temples is 

provided, which leads to a good fit of the spectacles 
on the head. 
Flexural pivot according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the joint consists of a fork spring (111) which 

is disposed at an end of a spectacles side piece 
(118) and is pivotally supported in the fork ends 

(112, 114) or in end plates fixed to these ends by a 
pin (119) which is insertable through a central joint 

part (121) which is fixed by an angle piece (100) or 
mounting tongue to the spectacles frame. 
Flexural pivot according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the central joint part (121) consists of a flat 

part that is partially circular shaped and whose 
surface is in contact with internal surfaces of the 

fork ends (112 and 114) which are provided with 
slanting teeth (122, 123, 124 and 125) and arranged 

rectangular to each other and coaxial to a central 
bore-hole, wherein the bore-hole (126) is aligned to 

the normal axis of the sliding level of the tooth 
surface. 
Flexural pivot according to Claims 6 and 7,
 
characterized in that the opposed surfaces of the  

 
fork ends (112 and 114) or their end plates, being 

disposed on these ends, have slanting wall teeth 
which are disposed as negative with respect to the 

slanting wall teeth on the central part of the joint 
(121), so that they mutually catch with the central 

part of the joint (121) between the fork ends (112 

and 114), wherein these parts are linked with each 
other by the joint pin (119), and maintain a 

sufficient backlash (L). 
Flexural pivot according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that during a rotation of the spectacles side-piece 

(118) with the fork spring (111) around the joint pin 
(119) the slanting surfaces between the teeth (122, 

123, 124 and 125) of the central part of the joint 
(121) glide on the corresponding opposed groove 

surfaces, which are disposed on the fork ends (122, 
114), whereby the straddling of the fork ends (112, 

114) and the elastic stress of the fork spring (111) 
takes place. 
Flexural pivot according to Claims 6 to 9,
 
characterized in that the elastic stress of the fork 

spring (111) pushes the fork ends (112, 114) towards 
the slanting surfaces of the teeth (122, 123, 124 and 

125) to let them engage in their predetermined seats, 
whereby the snapping motion takes place when the 

spectacles side pieces (118) are opened and closed on 
the spectacles and with an adequate pressure of the 

spectacles side pieces on the temples to assure a 
good fit of the spectacles on the head. 
Flexural pivot according to Claims 1, 2 and 6, 
characterized in that the joint pin (19 or 119) is 

disposed at the fork end (14 or 114) and/or at a 
spacer nut, wherein the joint pin has a backlash (L)  

 
between the spacer nut and the upper plate (13) or 

between the fork end (112) whose value preferably 
corresponds to the height of the teeth with the 

slanting tooth surfaces (122, 123, 124 and 125) 
and/or grooves (16, 17), which represent the movable 

cross-mesh, and that between the fork ends (12, 14 or 
112, 114) and the central part of the joint (18 or 

121) that provides with the teeth the opened or 
closed position and the straddling of the spectacles 

side pieces on the spectacles frame.
