<ABSTRACT>
A compound which acts as an antagonist at 5-HT4 receptors is of potential use in the treatment of conditions associated with bladder hypersensitivity, such as urinary incontinence, which is often associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and a compound which acts as an agonist at 5-HT4 receptors is of potential use in the treatment of conditions associated with a poorly functioning bladder, such as urinary bladder hypoactivity following prostectomy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treatment of urinary incontinence.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's
Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor, and that tropisetron
(ICS 205-930), which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, acts as an antagonist at this
receptor and metoclopramide is an agonist at this receptor.WO 91/16045 (SmithKline and French Laboratories Limited) describes the
use of cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias and
stroke.Metoclopramide has been shown to be effective in treating a poorly
functioning bladder, (Scand. J. Urology and Nephrology, 13:79-82 (1979) but this has
not been specifically linked to any known action of metoclopramide.There are reports in the literature of 5-HT4 receptors potentiating
contractions in human bladder (Br. J. Pharmacol, 61, 115P) and inhibiting
contractions in monkey bladder (2nd International Symposium on Serotonin,
Houston, September 1992, page 86).Paraplegia, vol. 26, no. 3, 1988, pages 159-161, Paraplegia, vol. 26, no. 3,
1988, pages 162-164, and Acta Belg. Med. Phys., vol. 12, no. 3, 1989, pages 81-88,
describe the effects of cisapride on bladder function. EP-A-467365 (E. R. Squibb &
Sons, Inc.) relates to the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, including zacopride,
which is also a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, in the treatment of urinary incontinence.We have now discovered that a compound which acts as an antagonist at
5-HT4 receptors is of potential use in the treatment of urinary incontinence, which is
often associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).The invention therefore provides the use of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist in the
manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of urinary
incontinence.5-HT4 receptor antagonists may be identified according to standard methods,
such as those described hereinafter, and that described in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's
Arch Pharmacol. 342, 619-622.Examples of 5-HT4 receptor antagonists include ICS 205-930 (tropisetron -
Sandoz), R 50 595 (Janssen), which is described in FR 76530 and Eur.J. Pharmacol., 
181 119-125 (1990), and SDZ 205-557, which is described by K.H. Buchheit and R.
Gamse in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 343 (Suppl.), R101 (1991).
DAU 6285 (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol, 345; 264-269 (1992) and RS
