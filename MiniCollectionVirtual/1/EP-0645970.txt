<DESCRIPTION>
 WOMENS' BRA AND PANTY UNDERWEAR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to womens' undergarments and in particular to an undergarment for useful for both bust support and underpanties combined, and specifically to an undergarment that eliminates seams, straps and hooks.2. Description of the Prior Art In recent years styling dictates that for proper appearance, the seams, hooks and buttons found in underpants and brassieres be hidden or unobservable especially with tight-fitting clothes. Although pantyhose are worn which eliminates some seams, pantyhose are restrictive in that they have to be removed for performing bodily functions. In addition, separately, brassieres of varying weights and material have been used which often include hooks either in the front or the rear of the brassiere. The present invention overcomes these problems by providing a single undergarment which is not restrictive and has no seams, straps or hooks and yet provides both breast support and functions as underpants.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A unitary undergarment for a woman that includes a top breast supporting band sized to fit snuggly around the upper torso of the body, said band being constructed of a nylon knit/mesh material of sufficient denier preferrably 30, and a triangularly shaped panty panel extending across the lower front portion of the upper band, tapering to the crotch area and then connected to the back of the upper band with a thin tubular thong-like portion. The panty triangular is made of a nylon knit/mesh fabric of a low denier preferrably 10 and may include a knitted cotton gusset.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 The upper elastic knit/mesh fabric band need not be specially shaped or formed (such as a bra cup) for breast support, but may include elastic inter-knitted segments for enhanced bust support and may also include one side of a fabric fastener (known under the trademark of VELCRO) knitted into the band at the factory for use with enhancing pads with the other side of the fabric fastener in the bust areas. The lower panty panel and thong is sufficiently elastic due to its nylon mesh fabric constructdenier) to permit displacement sideways without removing the garment for performing body functions.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved womens' undergarment that functions as a unitary garment for breast support and as a panty or underwear that has no seams, straps, hooks or buttons and that can be comfortably worn in an unrestricted manner.It is another object of
