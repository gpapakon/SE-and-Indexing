Bogie frame for a railway vehicle, the bogie 
frame (2) being provided with articulation blocks (27, 

28) for the articulated fastening of wheel-set links (14, 
20), characterized by an intermediate subframe (26) which 

is connected to the bogie frame (2) and has bearings (29) 
for the fastening/mounting of compensating levers (19).
