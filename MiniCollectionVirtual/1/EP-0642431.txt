<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to safety
apparatus for restraining the head and body of the
occupant of a vehicle to reduce the extent and
severity of injuries during a crash of the vehicle.
More specifically, it relates to an inflatable air bag
system attached to the occupant's safety belts that
removes any slack in the safety belts, distributes
crash loads over a larger area, and provides chin
support to reduce head and neck movement upon impact.Conventional safety belts are designed to
protect the occupants of vehicles such as automobiles,
airplanes, helicopters, trains, trucks, boats and
ships from primary injuries during an accident.
Primary injuries are injuries caused by the initial
impact of the occupants against the interior of the
vehicle. However, the protection provided by
conventional safety belts against even primary
injuries may be inadequate. For example, slack safety
belts may lead to unnecessarily serious primary
injuries. Moreover, the safety belts themselves may
often be responsible for secondary injuries.
Secondary injuries are injuries caused by the
restraint system, or by the body as it recoils after 
the initial impact. For example, if the load from the
safety belts is directed over small areas of the
occupant's body, the safety belts themselves may cause
serious injuries. Finally, even if a restraint system
successfully prevents the displacement of the
occupant's torso, displacement of the head may still
occur, resulting in neck and/or chest injuries.U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,948,541 and 3,905,615 to M.
Schulman, disclose an inflatable body and head
restraint system, wherein a bladder member is securely
affixed to shoulder straps and a lap belt. The
bladder member has chin, chest and pelvic bags. Upon
impact, the bladder member automatically inflates to
cushion the pelvic and chest areas and to prevent
forward rotation of the head.These systems suffer from a series of severe
drawbacks. First, upon inflation the bladder tends to
roll out from its position under the shoulder straps,
as shown in Figures 1a-1c. Since the bladder is
stowed under the harness, it is not fully deployed
before the load is applied to the straps. In a crash,
there is significant load on the strap, preventing the
underlying bag from lifting the strap uniformly away
from the occupant. Instead, the bag tends to deploy
in the direction of least resistance, so that it rolls
out to one side of the strap. Second, the seams and the webbing of the air
bag tend to split during inflation. Upon impact, the
harness exerts great

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle occupant restraint system (1)
comprising:


(a) at least one shoulder strap (3) having a front
face (10) and a back face (6);
(b) the or each shoulder strap (3) having associated
therewith an inflatable bladder (5), said bladder

comprising two webs (23, 24) extending across the bladder (5)
defining a central portion (7) and inner (8) and outer side (9)

portions of the bladder (5), the central portion (7) being
attached to the back face (6) of the associated shoulder

strap (3);
(c) a housing (13) positioned on the front face (10) of the
or each shoulder strap (3);
(d) gas generating means (12) located in the or each
housing (13) for generating gas to inflate said bladder (5); and
(e) an impact sensor (28) electrically connected to
the gas generating means (12);

   said housing comprising an airtight manifold (13)
having two ports (15, 16), leading respectively into said inner (8)

and outer (9) side portions, but having no ports leading
directly into the central portion (7) of the bladder (5), such

that the central portion (7) is fluidly connected to the
gas generator (12) only through the inner side portion (8) and

outer side portion (9) of the bladder (5);

   wherein, in the uninflated state of the bladder (5),
the side portions (8, 9) lie folded on top of the shoulder

strap (3).
A vehicle occupant restraint system as
claimed in claim 1, wherein said webs (23, 24) are fabricated

from permeable material.
A vehicle occupant restraint system as
claimed in claim 1, wherein said webs (23, 24) have a plurality

of holes therein.
A vehicle occupant restraint system as
claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, comprising two shoulder 

straps (3), a left shoulder strap and a right shoulder
strap.
A vehicle occupant restraint system as
claimed in claim 4, wherein the outer side portion (9) of

each bladder (5) extends around each shoulder strap (3) to lie
fo
lded on top of the front surface (10) of each shoulder
strap (3), and the inner side portion (8) of each bladder (5)

extends around each shoulder strap (3) to lie folded on top
of the vertical outer side portion (9).
A vehicle occupant restraint system as
claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein each bladder (5) further

comprises an upper lobe (31), the upper lobe (31) on the left
shoulder strap (3) cooperating with the upper lobe (31) on the

right shoulder strap (3) to support the occupant's head and
to limit displacement of the head and neck upon

inflation.
A method for protecting the occupants of a
vehicle equipped with an occupant restraint system (1) in

accordance with any preceding claim, comprising the
steps of:


(a) detecting an impact with the impact sensor (28);
(b) transmitting an electrical signal from the
impact sensor (28) to the gas generator (12);
(c) igniting the gas generator (12) and generating an
inflating gas;
(d) inflating the inner portion (8) and the outer
portion (9) of the bladder (5) such that the inner portion (8) and

the outer portion (9) start to deploy; and
(e) inflating the central portion (7) of the bladder (5)
when the deployment of the inner portion (8) and the outer

portion (9) is substantially complete.
The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
occupant restraint system (1) is in accordance with claim

6, the method further comprising the step of inflating
the upper lobe (31) on each bladder (5) to support the head and

limit head and neck displacement, said step occurring 
in conjunction with the step of inflating the inner

portion (8) and the outer portion (9) of each bladder (5).
