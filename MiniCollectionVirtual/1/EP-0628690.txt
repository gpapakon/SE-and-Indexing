<ABSTRACT>
A corner bearing block (2) for the pivotable and tiltable mounting of a sash/leaf of a window, of a door or the like on a fixed frame (1) comprises a basic plate (6) with screw-on holes (17 to 21), retaining bolts (15 and 16) and a bearing bolt (3) which is mounted rotatably on bearing lugs (7 and 8). Due to the production method, according to the invention, of the basic plate (6) with the bearing lugs (7 and 8), reinforcement borders (23 and 24) are provided in extension of the two bearing lugs (1 and 8). This results in the rear surface (25) of the basic plate (6) having a constant width over the entire length of the corner bearing block (2) and in a rear surface (25), in addition, being essentially planar. This configuration contributes to the considerable reinforcement and thus higher loadability and optimum attachment of the corner bearing block (2) on the frame (1).

<CLAIMS>
A corner mounting bracket (2) for the turn-and-tilt mounting 
of a leaf of a window, a door or the like on a fixed frame (1) or the 

like comprising a base plate (6) which has screw mounting holes (17 to 
21) and whose end which is the lower end in the position of use is 

provided with two mounting lugs (7, 8) on which a mounting pin (3) is 
mounted rotatably in a pivot plane which is perpendicular to the plane 

of the base plate (6), wherein the rear face (25) of the base plate (6) 
which can bear against the fixed frame (1) is of a constant width over 

the entire length, characterised in that each mounting lug (7, 8) goes 
directly into a reinforcing edge (23, 24) arranged in its plane, at the 

front side of the base plate (6). 
A corner mounting bracket according to claim 1 characterised 
in that the rear face (25) of the base plate (6) is at least 

substantially flat. 
A corner mounting bracket according to at least one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the base plate (6) is 

symmetrical relative to a transverse central plane (22) and holding 
pins (15, 16) are arranged symmetrically relative to said transverse 

central plane and the screw mounting holes (17, 21) are arranged 
between the holding pins. 
A corner mounting bracket according to claim 3 characterised 
in that the one holding pin (16) is arranged in the region of the 

mounting lugs (7, 8) and the two holding pins (15, 16) are formed by 
outwardly shaped portions. 
A corner mounting bracket according to at least one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the mounting eye (9) of the 

mounting pin (3) has at its outside peripheral surface (35) a plurality  
 

of detent notches (36, 37) which are displaced in the peripheral 
direction, for the selective engagement of a resilient detent member 

(33). 
A corner mounting bracket according to claim 5 characterised 
in that the detent member (33) is provided on an approximately U-shaped 

detent bracket (32), in particular integrally formed thereon, the two 
limbs (38, 39) of the U-shape of which have the mounting spindle (12) 

of the mounting pin (3) passing therethrough. 
A corner mounting bracket according to claim 6 characterised 
in that the detent member (33) is formed by a stamped-out and angularly 

bent tongue of the central web (34) of the U-shape of the detent 

bracket (32). 
A leaf (2) of a window, a door or the like, which leaf is 
rotatable at least about a vertical axis (3) but is preferably mounted 

turnably and tiltably on a fixed frame (1), wherein the lower mounting 
of the turn axis side has a corner mounting bracket (2) according to at 

least one of the preceding claims characterised in that the drilling 
configurations for the upper and the lower fitments are identical and 

disposed symmetrically relative to the centre of the vertical frame 
member, at the turn axis side, of the fixed frame (1). 
A process for the production of a corner mounting bracket (2) 
according to at least one of the preceding claims characterised by the 

following steps: 

a) stamping out the blank (27); 
b) perforating the stamping or blank (27); 
c) impressing a respective continuous longitudinal groove (28, 
29) near each longitudinal edge (30, 31) of the stamping (27) at the 

front face thereof;  
 
d) bending up in stages the longitudinal edges (30, 31) with the 
mounting lugs (7, 8) with the longitudinal grooves (28, 29) as bending 

lines; and 
e) fitting the mounting pin (3). 
A process according to claim 9 characterised in that prior to 
the operation of fitting the mounting spindle (12) of the mounting pin 

(3) the U-shaped detent bracket (32) is fitted into position. 
A process according to claim 9 or claim 10 characterised in 
that the holding pins (15, 16) are pressed out prior to the fitting 

operation and preferably prior to step d).
