<ABSTRACT>
The present method for bending metal sheets employs a bending device which has a die (10) and a bending punch (13) which penetrates into the die and is secured on a punch holder (12). To form seaming grooves, the portion of the sheet forming the outer wall of the groove is prebent with the aid of this bending device to form a pointed leading edge (8). The pointed leading edge (8) is then pressed flat, for which purpose a seam closer (20) inserted temporarily between the punch holder (12) and the die (10) of the bending device and having a hold-down device (24) is used. In this way, the seam closer can be operated largely independently of the bending device. In addition, working accuracy in the formation of the seaming groove is improved by the use of a seam closer having a hold-down device.
