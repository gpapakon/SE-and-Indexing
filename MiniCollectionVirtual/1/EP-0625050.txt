<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to treatment or
prevention of central nervous system (CNS) damage and relates particularly to
treatment comprising increasing the concentration of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)
and/or analogues thereof in the central nervous system of the patient to treat an injury or disease
that causes damage to cells of the CNS, particularly non-cholinergic neuronal cells
and/or glial cells.After asphyxial, traumatic, toxic, infectious, degenerative, metabolic, ischemic or hypoxic
insults to the central nervous system (CNS) of man a certain degree of neural damage may result.
For example, such neural damage can occur in cases of perinatal asphyxia associated with
intrapartum fetal distress such as following abruption, cord occlusion or associated with
intrauterine growth retardation; perinatal asphyxia associated with failure of adequate resuscitation
or apnea; severe neural insults associated with near miss drowning, carbon monoxide inhalation,
ammonia of other gaseous intoxication, cardiac arrest, collapse, coma, meningitis, hypoglycemia, or
status epilepticus; episodes of cerebral asphyxia associated with coronary bypass surgery;
cerebral anoxia or ischemia associated with stroke, hypotensive episodes, hypertensive crises;
cerebral trauma; or cerebral degenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease and multiple
sclerosis.Such neural damage can involve several different cell types of the CNS. For example,
periventricular leucomalacia, a lesion which affects the periventricular oligodendrocytes is generally
considered to be a consequence of hypoxicischemic injury to the developing preterm brain. Bejar,
et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol., 159:357-363 (1988); Sinha, et al., Arch. Dis. Child., 65:1017-1020
(1990); Young, et al., Ann. Neurol., 12:445-448 (1982). Further cholinergic neuronal cell
bodies are absent from most regions of the cortex in primates (Mesulam, et al., Neurosci., 12:669-686
(1984)) and rats (Brownstein, et al., in Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy, Classical
Transmitters in the CNS, pp. 23-53 (Elsevier, 1984)). Damage to the cerebral cortex by trauma,
asphyxia, ischemia, toxins or infection is frequent and may cause sensory, motor or cognitive,
deficits. Glial cells which are non-neuronal cells in the CNS are necessary for normal CNS
function. Infarcts are a principle component of hypoxic-ischemia induced injury and loss of glial
cells is an essential component of infarction. Multiple sclerosis is associated with loss of myelin
and oligodendrocytes, similarly
