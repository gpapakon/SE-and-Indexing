<ABSTRACT>
A method for transporting valuable documents from a first location to a second location in a break-in protected case provided with means which, on triggering, acts on the valuables in the case, for instance by dye-disfiguration, triggering being controlled by a timing mechanism in the case. The process comprises that the despatcher at the first location, after putting the valuables in the case, locks it and activates the timing mechanism to induce triggering after a given transport time in the lack of any deactivation, that the case is transported from the first location to the second location, and that the recipient at the second location deactivates the timing mechanism in the case and afterwards opens it. The distinguishing features of the method are that an ID sigil is calculated at the first location, based upon a secret recipient key, an algorithm and open data which includes non-fixed data, such as time data, that the calculated sigil is electronically stored in the case in connection with the locking thereof, preferably together with the non-fixed data necessary for sigil calculation, that, in connection with receipt of the case at the second location, and ID sigil is calculated based upon a recipient sigil provided by the recipient, the algorithm and open data, including said non-fixed data, and that a comparison is conducted in the case between the stored sigil and the sigil thus calculated at the second location, correspondence between the sigils permitting deactivation of the time mechanism and allowing opening of the case without any abovementioned acts upon the valuables.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR TRANSPORTING VALUABLESThe present invention relates to a method for transporting valuable documents from a first location to a second location in a break-in protected case provided with means which, on triggering, acts upon the valuable documents in the case, for instance by dye-disfiguration, triggering being controlled by a timing mechanism in the case, which method comprises that the despatcher at the first location, after putting the valuables in the case, locks it_and activates the timing mechanism to induce triggering after a given transport time in the absence of any deactivation, the case is transported from the first location to the second location, and the recipient at the second location deactivates the timing mechanism in the case and afterwards opens it.The object of the invention is to improve the known technique so as to provide enhanced flexibility and improved securit .This object is attained in a method according to the invention having the features defined in the accompanying patent claims.The underlying concept is the utilization of a break-in protected, computer equipped case with variable locking codes. The code is linked to a "sigil", a number combination created by a sufficiently long sigil key, an algorithm and a number of known ( "open" ) but constantly changing data.The sigil key, which is a prerequisite for the correct calculation of the opening code, is held by the despatcher and the recipient of the money or valuable documents and 

is secret.The sigil key is advantageously held in a "smart card", a card with a memory function and a certain calculating capacity of its own - i.e. a computer. The information in the card together with the "open" information regarding a case is processed via a computer card reader ( "sigilator" ) and then sent to a computer in the case, the case being opened if the right opening code has been received.The break-in protected case is provided with various forms of alarm and means which upon activation uses dye to disfigure the money or valuable documents in a consistent fashion so that they become unacceptable as a means of payment, but can still be identified by the authenticated legitimate owner and in the circumstances replaced in the most appropriate manner.The case is further provided with technical means so that it can determine for itself if the conditions for activation, i.e. dye-disfiguration, are fulfilled. Conditions for dye-disfiguration are, for example, an attempt to break into the case, an electricity supply problem,

 CLAIMS
1. A method for transporting valuables from a first location to a second location in a break-in protected case provided with means which, on triggering, acts upon the valuables in the case, for instance by dye-disfiguration, triggering being controlled by a timing mechanism in the case, which method comprises that the despatcher at the first location, after putting the valuables in the case, locks it and activates the timing mechanism to induce triggering after a given transport time in the absence of any deactivation, the case is transported from the first location to the second location, and the recipient at the second location deactivates the timing mechanism in the case and afterwards opens it,
characterized in that
an ID sigil is calculated at the first location, based upon a secret recipient key, an algorithm and open information which includes non-fixed information, such as time information, the calculated sigil is electronically stored in the case in connection with the locking thereof, preferably together with the non-fixed information necessary for sigil calculation, an ID sigil is calculated in connection with receipt of the case at the second location, based upon a recipient sigil provided by the recipient, the algorithm and open information, including said non-fixed information, and that a comparison is conducted in the case between the stored sigil and the sigil thus calculated at the second location, correspondence between the sigils causing deactivation of the time mechanism and allowing opening of the case without any said acts upon the valuables. 


2. A method according to claim 1, the transport being effected by a vehicle, characterized in that a second, similarly activatable time mechanism is used to bring about, in the absence of any deactivation, triggering after a given transfer time in connection with post- locking transfer of the case to the transport vehicle and transfer from the transport vehicle to the recipient, respectively, the case being placed in the transport vehicle in conditions which signify that, as long as certain given preconditions are fulfilled, said second time mechanism is deactivated and removal of the case from the transport vehicle brings about reactivation of the second time mechanism, and wherein correspondence between the sigils in the earlier mentioned sigil comparison also brings about deactivation of the second time mechanism.
3. A method according to claim 2, characterized in that the case is provided with a case computer, the transport vehicle is provided with a vehicle computer, a transport key is stored in both the case and vehicle computers, the case and vehicle computers are caused to at least intermittently communicate with each other during transport of the case in the transport vehicle and thereby carry out sigil verification, the respective computers calculating a transport sigil based upon the transport key, an algorithm and information transferred between the computers, and wherein the case computer, on correspondence between its calculated sigil and the sigil obtained from the vehicle computer, temporarily deactivates said second timing mechanism.
4. A method according to claim 3, characterized in that the deactivation consequent on sigil correspondence signifies that the second timing mechanism is reset to an initial setting. 


5. A method according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that at least the first transfer of information for calculation of the transport sigil is effected from the case computer to the vehicle computer which sends its sigil based thereon to the case computer.
6. A process according to any one of claims 3 to 5 , characterized in that the vehicle computer is maintained activated by regularly performed, predetermined actions and/or by the fulfillment of predetermined conditions, i.e. radio communication switched on, position information regularly submitted etc.
7.

8. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that calculation of the ID sigil is carried out at the first location, based on a recipient key which is stored in a recipient arranged active card, reading of the active card in the utilized calculating device or computer which is caused to communicate with the case being preferably initiated by the despatcher providing a personal code, i.e. a "PIN code".
9. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the case is initially provided with 


a "depot" key, which is preferably unique, and the case, in connection with provision of information at the depot prior to a transport assignment is first logged on to the depot computer system by depot sigil verification.
