 TITLEHIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS CONTAINING GUANIDINE.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to inhibitors of proteases encoded in retroviruses, in particular, to inhibitors cf the virally encoded protease of the Human Immunodeficiency VirusBACKGROUNDRetroviruses, that is, viruses within the family of Retroviridae, are a class of viruses which transport their genetic material as ribonucleic acid rather than deoxyribonucleic acid. Also known as RNA-tumor viruses, their presence has been associated with a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. They are believed to be the causative agents in pathological states associated with infection by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) , murine leukemia virus (MLV) , mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) , feline leukemia virus (FeLV) , bovine leukemia virus (BLV) , Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) , simian sarcoma virus (SSV) , simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) , human T- 

 lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I, -II) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, HIV-2) , which is the etiologic agent of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and AIDS related complexes, and many others. Although the pathogens have, in many of these cases, been isolated, no effective method for treating this type of infection has been developed.Current treatments for retroviral diseases generally involve administration of compounds which inhibit reverse transcriptase, such as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and 2',3'- dideoxycytidine. These treatments have proven useful to reduce viral titers and retard the disease process, but, in general, have not proven useful to arrest or reverse the disease. In addition, they may have adverse side effects, and lose their efficacy over time. Accordingly, new treatments for viral disease are needed.Virally-encoded proteases function in many retroviruses to hydrolyze viral polyprotein precursors and to yield functional viral proteins. The proteolytic activity provided by the virally-encoded protease in processing the polyproteins cannot be provided by the host and is essential to the life cycle of the retrovirus. It has been demonstrated that retroviruses which lack a protease or contain a mutated form of it, lack infectivity. See Katoh et al . , Virology, 145, 280-92(1985), Crawford et al . , J. Virol . , 53, 899-907(1985) and Debouck et al . , Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . USA, 84, 8903-6(1987) . Inhibition of retroviral protease, therefore, presents a method of therapy for retroviral disease.Methods to express retroviral proteases in E. coli have been
