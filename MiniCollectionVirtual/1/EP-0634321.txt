<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a packaging 
machine for wrapping books or the like 

for postal deliveries. The package 
blank includes a rectangularly shaped 

outer cardboard (2), which is folded 
by means of transverse belts (5) from 

a flat condition to a tube surrounding 
the four sides of a book. The belts 

(5) extend through sliding slots included 
in the bottom edge of guides 

(8) and said guides (8) are operated 
in vertical and horizontal plane by 

means of pneumatic cylinders (11, 14). 
The apparatus also requires two sets 

of individually operable press plates 
(6 and 7) for pressing the package 

from above before and after the folding 
of a sheet of cardboard (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging machine for 
wrapping books or the like for postal deliveries by using a 
package blank, including a rectangularly shaped outer 
cardboard, said machine comprising a conveyor track, an 
adhesive application station alongside the conveyor track 
upstream of a wrapping station, a wrapping station which 
includes folding elements on either side of the conveyor 
track for folding said outer cardboard from a flat condition 
to a tube surrounding the four sides of a book, and a press 
element operable in vertical direction above the conveyor 
track for pressing the overlapped ends of the outer cardboard 
against the top surface of a book in view of fastening 
the ends to each other by means of an adhesive applied 
therebetween. This type of packaging machine is prior known from the 
Applicant's Patent publications EP-0,273,240 and EP-0,378,787. 
These prior known devices are very useful but their 
construction is quite complicated and the price is high. The 
former has a little less complicated construction but it is 
respectively slower in operation. An object of the invention is to provide an improved 
packaging machine which has a simple construction and is 
inexpensive in relation to production capacity. A further object of the invention is to provide an improved 
packaging machine for wrapping books of varying sizes, a 
plurality of books or piles of documents. These objects are achieved by means of a packaging machine 
of the invention, which is characterized in that the 
wrapping station is further provided with second press 
elements, including a horizontal press plate which has one 
unsupported end and is operable both in vertical direction  
 
and in the direction of the conveyor track by means of 
individually controlled power units, and that said folding 
elements include transverse belts which extend through 
sliding slots included in the bottom edge of guides, said 
guides being adapted to be operable in vertical and horizontal 
plane by means of power units, whose automatic control 
moves the guides first upwards, then towards each other, and 
then alternately downwards in such a manner that the belts 
are first elevated from the conveyor track level as said 
second press elements press the top side of the package 
blank, whereby said belts fold the end sections of the outer 
cardboard first upwards and then alternately on top of each 
other in an overlapping fashion while said second press 
elements travel in the direction of the conveyor track for

<CLAIMS>
A packaging machine for wrapping books or the like for 
postal deliveries by using a package blank (2, 4), including 

a rectangularly shaped outer cardboard (2), said machine 
comprising a conveyor track (1), an adhesive application 

station (3) alongside the conveyor track upstream of a 
wrapping station, a wrapping station which includes folding 

elements (5, 8) on either side of the conveyor track for 
folding said outer cardboard from a flat condition to a tube 

surrounding the four sides of a book, and a press element 
(6) operable in vertical direction above the conveyor track 

for pressing the overlapped ends of the outer cardboard 
against the top surface of a book in view of fastening the 

ends to each other by means of an adhesive applied therebetween, 

characterized
 in that the wrapping 
station is further provided with second press elements (7, 

18-21), including a horizontal press plate (7) which has one 
unsupported end and is operable both in vertical direction 

and in the direction of the conveyor track by means of 
individually controlled power units (19, 21), and that said 

folding elements include transverse belts (5) which extend 
through sliding slots included in the bottom edge of guides 

(8), said guides (8) being adapted to be operable in 
vertical and horizontal direction by means of power units (11, 

14), whose automatic control moves the guides (8) first 
upwards, then towards each other, and then alternately 

downwards in such a manner that the belts are first elevated 
from the level of the conveyor track (1) as said second 

press elements (7) press the top side of the package blank, 
whereby said belts fold the end sections of the outer 

cardboard (2) first upwards and then alternately on top of 
each other in an overlapping fashion while said second press 

elements (7) travel in the direction of the conveyor track 
for retracting said press plate from underneath the folded 

end sections of the outer cardboard.  
 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the wrapping station includes sensor 

elements (9), which travel along with the guides (8) and 
collide with the sides of a package blank as the end 

sections of the outer cardboard are upright in a position 
inclined towards each other, one of said guides (8) stopping 

or decelerating its motion with the other guide (8) effecting 
a stroke downwards.
