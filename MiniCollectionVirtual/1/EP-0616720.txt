<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of manufacturing highly conducting composites, the method being characterized by the following steps: a) contacting a powder or fibres with an aqueous solution containing an appreciably water-soluble high-molecular substance, b) optionally washing with water, c) contacting with a dispersion containing finely particulate electrically conducting material, wetting agents (surfactants) and an ionogenic metal compound, d) optionally washing with water and e) moulding to the required shape.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing composite materials of high 
conductivity, characterised by the method steps 


a) contacting a powder or fibres with an aqueous 
solution, containing a macromolecular, considerably 

water-soluble substance, 
b) if necessary, rinsing with water, 
c) contacting with a dispersion, containing conductive, 
finely divided solid particles, wetting agents 

(surfactants) and an ionogenic metal compound, 
d) if necessary, rinsing with water, and 
e) form-shaping. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the conductively coated particles are subjected to 

a form-shaping or compacting process by pressing, 
sintering and/or adding adhesives or plastic bonding 

agents. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the particles, which are made conductive by 

means of substrate-induced coagulation, are wholly or 
partially of a thermoplastic nature. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein graphite 
and/or carbon black are used as the conductive 

particles.  
 
Method according to claim 1, wherein anionic or 
cationic surfactants or phase-transfer catalysts are 

used as the wetting agents. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein fluorides, 
chlorides, bromides or iodides of lithium, sodium, 

potassium, magnesium, calcium, barium, strontium, 
ammonium or copper are used as the ionogenic metal 

compounds. 
Composite material of high conductivity, 
produced in accordance with a method according to claims 

1 and 2, characterised in that, after the form-shaping 
process, the particles which have become conductive by 

means of "substrate-induced coagulation" are further 
metallised by galvanic or chemical reductive processes.
