<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for preparing boxes or the like 
the openings of which are closed by a heat-meltable glue, on the 

outer surface of the boxes there being applied, in correspondence 
with the region in which said glue is applied, a layer of 

thermosensitive recording material or ink the colour or tone of 
which changes irreversibly if the closed finished box is heated in 

order to fraudulently open it. 
According to the method, the layer of thermosensitive recording 
material is applied to the box directly by the box manufacturer 

and in any event before the products to be contained therein are 
inserted into the box.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing containers with 
their opening sealable by means of a heat-meltable or heat-softenable 
glue, on the outer surface of said containers there 
being provided, in correspondence with the region in which the 
glue is positioned, a layer of thermosensitive recording material 
or ink which changes colour at a temperature equal to or less than 
the softening point of the glue. Such containers, consisting generally of cardboard boxes, are 
intended to contain high-value products, generally pharmaceutical, 
cosmetics or other products, for which it is desired to prevent 
tampering which could be achieved by heating the containers 
locally in correspondence with the regions in which the glue is 
applied, this thus softening or melting to enable the containers 
to be opened and their contents tampered with, after which the 
containers could be again closed after again heating the glue. To prevent fraudulent opening of the containers in the aforesaid 
manner, the patent US-A-4,480,749 describes a container, on the 
outer surface of which in correspondence with its openings there 
is provided a layer of a temperature-sensitive indicator, such 
that its colour or colour tone changes irreversibly at a 
temperature equal to or less than the melting or softening point 
of the glue. Hence if an attempt is made to fraudulently open the 
container and then reclose it after tampering with the contents, 
the colour change of the said indicator immediately and clearly  
 
indicates that tampering has taken place. As described and claimed in the said US-A-4,480,749 the 
temperature-sensitive indicator is applied to the container after 
the product to be protected has been placed in it and after the 
container has been closed by the the said glue. More 
specifically, as specified on lines 52-56 of column 2 of the said 
patent, the temperature-sensitive indicator is a liquid (ink or 
recording material) which is sprayed onto the container when its 
packaging is complete. Such a procedure results in serious problems (which have prevented 
the working of that described in the USA patent), both because the 
thermosensitive ink or recording material or their solvents can 
contaminate the product (especially in the case of a 
pharmaceutical or food product) contained in the container (box), 
and because the container packaging lines or machines have to be 
flanked by costly and bulky systems for applying the 
thermosensitive ink or recording material, and finally because the 
applicatio

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing a container with its opening 
sealable by a heat-meltable glue 

disposed on an inner face of a sheet of the box whose corresponding outer or exposed 
face is provided with an 

anti-tamper layer of thermosensitive recording material 
whose colour changes at a temperature lower than or equa
l to the glue softening point, 
characterised in that said layer of thermosensitive recording 

material is applied to the exposed face of the flat sheet which is 
to form the box, or of the semifinished box, the container being 

closed on the packaging line or machine immediately after applying said heat-meltable 
glue, 

the quantity of glue used 
being sufficiently small to prevent the heat transmitted by it 

through the thickness of the constituent sheet of the box from 
heating the recording material to the temperature at which it 

changes colour. 
A semifinished box or a punched flat sheet provided with a 
layer of thermosensitive recording material 

on its outer or exposed face whose corresponding inner face has to be glued to form the 
closed box according to 

the method of claim 1.
