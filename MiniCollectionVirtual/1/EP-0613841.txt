<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for aligning
vessels, and more particularly, to such apparatus which
utilizes a robot.An apparatus for aligning vessels sequentially in a
given direction as they are supplied at random is disclosed,
for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 57,004/1989.The disclosed apparatus comprises a discharge
conveyor and a chute which is disposed over the discharge
conveyor and extending vertically upward, the chute
having a feed port at its upper end through which vessels
are supplied sequentially and at random. The chute is
internally provided with a stop against which a vessel is
temporarily supported, and is successively aligned by an
engaging plate and a support member which are disposed below
the stop. Specifically, when the vessel is released from
the support by the stop, it then drops until its top end or
bottom end is engaged by the support member which assumes
an advanced position. As the support member retracts to its 
retracted position, a barrel portion of the vessel supported
by the support member is engaged with the engaging plate.
If the vessel is engaged with the engaging plate in its
erected condition, the vessel is allowed to pass while
maintaining its erected position, but in the event the
vessel is engaged with the engaging plate in its inverted
condition, the vessel is reversed into its erected position
before it falls onto the discharge conveyor. With this
arrangement, the vessels, which are supplied into the
chute at random, are aligned with each other and assume
an erected position in which their top ends are oriented
upwards after they have fallen through the chute and been
placed on the discharge conveyor.However, in a conventional apparatus as described
above, if the size of vessels to be processed is changed,
the chute as well as other components must be changed in
accordance with the new size of the vessel, resulting in
a troublesome remodelling operation.US-A-3831738 discloses bottle orientation apparatus in
which a conveyor belt receives randomly-oriented bottles
from a hopper, the bottles are oriented to be deposited
axially aligned on a second conveyor and are subsequently
manipulated to an upright condition. FR-A-2304893 discloses a system whereby laminar
articles (1) on a conveyor belt (2) are oriented by a robot
device in response to information regarding orientation of
the components obtained by inspecting the components by
means of a video camera.Accordingly, the present invention provides an
apparatus for aligning vessels, as set

conveyance of the second conveyor (14) for erecting a
vessel (3) to its upright position as it is conveyed by

the second conveyor (14) characterised by a camera (16)
disposed on a path of conveyance of the vessels (3) by the

first conveyor (2) for photographing a manner of placement
of vessels (3) thereon; a robot (13) responsive to the

camera (16) for aligning vessels (3) on the first conveyor
(2) into a given direction and for delivering the vessels

(3) from the first to the second conveyor; the robot (13)
including a catcher (26) for catching a vessel (3), the

robot (13) operating such that the catcher (26) catches a
vessel (3) disposed in a horizontal position on the first

conveyor (2) at a catch position (A) defined on the first
conveyor (2) when the vessel (3) assumes a predetermined

orientation or an opposite orientation with respect to the
catcher (26) and the catcher carries the vessel (3) which

it has caught to a release position (B) defined on the
second conveyor (14) where it releases the vessel (3), the

correction means (15) being disposed at the release
position (B) and being operative to engage a portion of

the vessel (3) released from the catcher (26), which
portion is loaded adjacent to the mouth of the vessel (3),

while the vessel (3) assumes a horizontal position, and
being operative to erect the vessel (3) by rotating it so 

that its mouth is oriented upwardly.
An apparatus according to Claim 1 in which the
operation of the robot (13) is controlled by a controller

(12) to which a picture of a vessel or vessels (3) on the
first conveyor (2) as taken by the camera (16) is input,

the controller (12) being operative to compare a direction
of a vessel (3), the picture of which is input from the

camera (16), against a pre-stored direction in which the
vessel (3) is to be oriented and to calculate an angle of

rotation by which the robot (13) must be rotated in order
to catch a vessel (3) on the first conveyor (2).
