<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a straightening device (1) for straightening a sheet of material (2), for example cardboard, supplied continuously from a reel (3). Said device is characterized in that the supports (14, 15) of the bearings (12, 13) of both return cylinders (5, 6) form guides for the bearings (12, 13) mounted movably on said supports, and linking means (16, 17) are provided between the movable straightening block (8) and the bearings (12, 13) of the return cylinders (5, 6) so as to reduce the distance (d) between the axes of the two return cylinders (5, 6) as a function of the amplitude of the V deformation of the sheet (2), and also to compensate automatically the variation of the length of said sheet.

Device (1) for straightening a continuously advancing sheet of material (2), 
for example cardboard, supplied from a reel (3), comprising a frame comprising 

supports (14, 15) for the bearings (12, 13) of two guide cylinders (5,6) with parallel 
axes, over which the sheet passes, forming a flat section (2a) contained in a plan 

(P) tangential to the two cylinders, and a straightening block (8) mounted to move 
between the two guide cylinders (5, 6), perpendicularly to the section of sheet 

(2a) extending between these two cylinders (5, 6), this mobile straightening block 
(9) comprising at least one transverse pressure member (9, 11), adapted to abut 

on one face of the sheet (2) to push it out of the plane (P) tangential to the two 
cylinders and to give it the form of a V between these two cylinders, characterized 

in that the supports (14, 15) of the bearings (12, 13) of the two guide 
cylinders (5, 6) constitute guides for the bearings (12, 13) movably mounted on 

these supports and linking means (16, 17) are provided between the mobile 
straightening block (8) and the bearings (12, 13) of the guide cylinders (5, 6) so as 

to reduce the distance (d) between the axes of the two guide cylinders (5, 6) as a 
function of the amplitude of the V deformation of the sheet (2) and thus automatically 

to compensate the variation in length of this sheet. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the supports (14, 15) 
forming guides for the bearings (12, 13) are constituted by rectilinear housings or 

cams inclined with respect to the plan (P) tangential to the two guide cylinders (5, 
6). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the supports (14, 15) 
forming guides for the bearings (12, 13) are constituted by non-rectilinear housings 

or cams.  
 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that 
the linking means are constituted by connecting rods (16, 17) which are articulated, 

at one of their ends, on the straightening block (8) about respective axes 
(18, 19) and, at their other ends, on the bearings (12, 13) of the guide cylinders (5, 

6).
