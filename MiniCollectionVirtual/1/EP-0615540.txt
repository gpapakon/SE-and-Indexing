<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process for making
rinse-active
foam control particles for inclusion in a detergent
composition, i.e. foam control particles mainly active
in the rinse-cycle of a laundry process.It has become common practice in the detergent
industry to include in detergent compositions
materials which are intended to control the amount of
foam produced during a laundry process.Although suds-control during the washing cycle of a
laundry process is important, so as to avoid negative
interference with the action of the wash liquor upon
the fabrics, it is also known that suds-control during
the rinse cycle of a laundry process is desirable; Indeed, excessive foaming during the rinse cycle in a washing machine can cause
foam spillage and damage to the machine, while in the handwash context, there is
an advantage in lowering the foam production during rinsing, so as to shorten this
step.Soaps of fatty acids have been used for such a rinse-active suds control function,
and they have usually been spray-dried together with the rest of the detergent
composition.However, there is a desire to reduce organic emissions during manufacturing of
detergents, in particular during spray drying.EP-A-0 432 449, published on 19th June 1991, provides a composition of
powdered detergent comprising a spray dried base powder with no soap, or a
very low percentage of soap, and which further comprises soap which is "post
added" by dry-mixing with the base powder.GB-A-1 204 123, published on 3rd September 1970, discloses a process of mixing
a surfactant containing detergent powder with other granules, the granules
comprising an organic extrudable solid. One such organic extrudable solid is a
sodium salt of C8 to C22 fatty acid.GB-A-0 486 819, published on 10th June 1938, discloses a process for producing a
soap powder by converting a partially- dried soap into a plastic or semi-fluid mass,
disintegrating the soap mass into discrete particles, and solidifying the particles.The present invention provides a process for making rinse-active foam-control
particles for inclusion in a detergent composition in powder form.The rinse-active foam-control particles comprise a soap consisting essentially of a
soap of fatty acid of which at least 80% by weight contains from 16 to 18 carbon
atoms, the geometric mean particle size of the particles being inferior to 1mm,
preferably inferior to 0.4 mm.The process of the present invention comprises the steps of drying the fatty acid
soap slurry to a moisture level inferior to

A process for making a foam-control agent, the foam control agent comprising
rinse active foam-control particles for inclusion in a detergent composition in powder

form, the rinse active foam-control particles consisting essentially of a soap of fatty
acids wherein at least 80% by weight of the soap of fatty acid contains from 16 to

18 carbon atoms, the geometric mean particle size of the particles, which is the
median of the cumulative weight distribution, is inferior to 1 mm, and characterised

in that a fatty acid soap slurry is dried to a moisture level inferior to 9% by weight of
the slurry, pressed into noodles, and the noodles are ground into a fine powder.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the foam control particles have a
geometric mean particle size inferior to 0.4 mm.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the soap of fatty acids is selected from
tallow soap, and tallow/coconut soap with a weight ratio of tallow to coconut not less

than 70/30.
A process according to claim 4 wherein the soap slurry is dried to a moisture level
not exceeding 5% by weight of the slurry.
