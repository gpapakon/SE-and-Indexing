<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine is provided with water injectors (2) and a source of pressurized water (23) having at least one injector valve (2) operated by a computer (30) which senses various operating conditions of the engine and in response to said conditions opens or closes the injector valves (2) allowing or blocking the passing of high pressure water into the combustion chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to internal combustion engines
and particularly to such engines where water is injected
into the combustion chambers under precisely controlled
conditions.The benefits and gains in fuel economy by the
injection of water into the cylinders of an internal
combustion engine have long been known. However, all
previously known methods of injecting water into the
cylinders have inherent drawbacks in design, making mass
production of water injected engines undesirable.Representative of the prior art devices are the
following patents: US-A-864,877 shows an explosive engine
having an inlet duct to the combustion chamber; US-A-2,101,554
shows an internal combustion engine having a
solenoid operated valve for injecting water into a
secondary chamber; US-A-2,218,522 shows an internal
combustion chamber having a water injecting valve opening
into the combustion chamber; US-A-2,489,177 shows a water
injection valve in the engine cylinder; US-A-3,074,228
shows a combined internal combustion and steam engine; US-A-4,018,192
discloses a water injection system for internal
combustion engines; US-A-4,417,441 shows a combustion
chamber in the piston head; US-A-4,589,377 discloses an
injector fitted in the combustion chamber; US-A-422,950
discloses a valve injector in the combustion chamber. In all previous systems, the introduction of water
into the combustion chambers has been achieved by
mechanical means - the injectors being mechanically driven
by camshafts, gears or sprockets. In all of the prior
known art, any gains made in fuel economy are offset by
drawbacks in design. Many previous systems require major
mechanical changes in engine design, some are antiquated
and have an extensive number of parts prone to failure or
breakdown. However, the main disadvantage to all currently
known systems of water injection is that control over the
injection of the water in response to changing engine
requirements is very limited.US-A-4,502,420 and US-A-4,558,665 disclose systems
which have attempted to solve this problem by controlling
the injectors with a computer or electronic control unit.
However, these two systems are still mechanical in nature
because although the injectors are computer controlled, the
actual introduction of water into the cylinder is still
limited and ultimately controlled by a mechanically
operated valve (the intake valve of the engine). This is
highly undesirable because the water can only enter the
cylinder when the intake valve is open. Therefore,
injection of water can only take
