<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus determines an angular location 
on a round object (3) during a current operation in order 

to facilitate the positioning of that object for subsequent 
operation. At a first station (1), an angular location 

identifying feature (A) is sensed, and an angle (C) at 
which a pre-determined desired angular location (B) is 

located with respect to the feature (A) is determined. At 
a second station (1), the feature (A) is sensed, the 

object (3) is indexed from the feature in an amount equal 
to the angle (C) to re-locate the desired angular location 

(B), and the object (3) is processed at the re-located pre-determined 
desired angular location (B). This processing 

step may be a marking step at the second station, but may 
be the performance of the subsequent operation. The first 

station means includes means for sensing the angular 
location identifying feature on the object (3) and 

measurement means for determining the angle (C) at which a 
pre-determined desired angular location (B) on the object 

is located with respect to the feature (A). The second 
station means includes sensing means for sensing the 

feature (A), indexing means for indexing from the feature 
in an amount equal to the angle (C).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to angle-dependent processing of
objects such as tyres, wheels or tyre/wheel assemblies
wherein the processing of the object at a given processing
station requires angle-specifying information generated or
defined previously at some other processing station.In the processing of round objects, it frequently
becomes necessary to perform a subsequent operation based
on an angular location on the object identified in a
current operation. Normally, this requirement is achieved
by placing a mark upon the object during the current
operation. That mark is then used as a reference for
positioning of the round object during the subsequent
operation.In the processing of automobile tyres
and wheels, see for example WO-A-92/01918, it is known to place a mark upon the tyre at
an angular location corresponding to the high point of the
first harmonic of the radial force variation of the tyre,
and to form a valve stem hole on the wheel at an angular
location corresponding to the low point of the first
harmonic of the average radial run out of the wheel. During
subsequent processing, when the tyre is mounted upon the
wheel, it is desirable to align the tyre and wheel such
that the marks are at the same angular location. This
effectively reduces radial force variation in the resulting
tyre/wheel assembly.However, physically placing marks upon the objects
consumes cycle time and thus reduces process throughput.
For example, in order to form a visible mark on the side
wall of a tyre at a location identified by a tyre
uniformity machine, it is necessary to substantially stop
rotation of the tyre with the high point of the radial
force variation oriented in the direction of the marking
devices, and to then wait while the mark is applied to the
tyre. These steps can consume as much as 5% of the
machine's cycle time on the average. In other equipment, it has been known to reduce this
consumption of cycle time by providing a second station on
the machinery dedicated to carrying out the marking
operation. While this second station adds expense to the
machinery, it is nonetheless frequently beneficial to the
cost effectiveness of the machinery to perform the marking
operation at this second station. However, in tyre
uniformity machinery, it is not possible to accurately
apply an angular mark at a second station of the machine.
This is so because the tyre must be "stripped" from the
test rim of the first station and them moved to the second
station; this causes loss of angular orientation of the
tyre.It is
