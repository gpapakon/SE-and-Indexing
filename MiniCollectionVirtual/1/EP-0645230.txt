<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bank
quantity adjusting device for an extruder for extruding
a polymeric material such as rubber to form a sheet.This kind of extruder is provided with a
roller die consisting of a pair of upper and lower
rollers on the downstream side of an outlet of an
extruder body. A material supplied from a batch type
mixer into the extruder body is extruded by a screw
provided in the extruder body, and is then allowed to
pass between the pair of upper and lower rollers of the
roller die, thus forming a sheet from the extruded
material. In such an extruder, a bank quantity of the
material accumulated in a bank portion defined between
the outlet of the extruder body and the roller die must
be properly controlled to uniform the shape (width,
thickness, etc.) of the sheet to be discharged.A control method for the bank quantity is
described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 55-4575, 
for example. According to this method, the bank
quantity is controlled by detecting a bank pressure and
then controlling a screw speed or a roller die speed on
the basis of the bank pressure detected. In this
conventional method including detection of the bank
pressure, however, the bank quantity is not proportional
to the bank pressure because of a variation in hardness
of rubber due to a difference in composition of the
material. Accordingly, accurate control is difficult to
perform.An adjusting device for the bank quantity according to
the preamble portion of claim 1
is described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-118841,
for example. According to this device, the bank
quantity is controlled by detecting a bank quantity and
then controlling a screw speed or a roller die speed on
the basis of the bank quantity detected. In this
conventional device including detection of the bank
quantity, however, there is a problem that a movable
portion for detecting the bank quantity is clogged with
rubber. Examples of such a bank quantity detecting
device for detecting the bank quantity are described in
Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 4-10918 and 5-104607.
The former discloses a contact type of bank quantity 
detecting device, while the latter discloses a
noncontact type of bank quantity detecting device.It is accordingly an object of the present
invention to provide a bank quantity adjusting device
for an extruder which can accurately control a bank
quantity regardless of a difference in composition of a
material to be extruded.The object is solved with a bank quantity adjusting
device having the features of claim
