<ABSTRACT>
A laser cutting apparatus (10) whereby the laser beam (11) is directed on to a cutting portion (13) of the workpiece (15), and a jet (18) of gas is guided, fully enclosed within solid walls, on to the cutting portion (13, 13a) in an inclined direction in relation to the beam (11) and at such a velocity as to control, by the jet (18), the fluid-thermodynamic effects caused by interaction with the beam (11) and with the material liquefied by the same, and to flush the liquefied material out of the cut (16) in steady, controlled manner. The jet (18) is supplied by means of a solid-walled conduit (21), the end portion of which conveniently presents an opening (37) enabling passage of the beam (11) on to the cutting portion (13, 13a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of supplying 
laser cutting gas, and a cutting apparatus implementing 
such a method. Laser cutting, e.g. of metal plate, is usually performed 
with the aid of a jet of gas directed on to the cutting 
area for flushing out the liquefied material. The type of gas used depends on the workpiece material, 
and must be so selected as to prevent undesired chemical 
reactions affecting the cutting faces. It is 
particularly important to prevent the formation of 
products affecting the metallurgical structure of the 
cutting faces, and so resulting in hardness or fragility 
preventing post-process machining or actual use of the. 
part, if no further machining is required. Oxygen is excellent for cutting ferrous materials 
(alloys), due to the exothermic reaction produced at 
high temperatures (over 720°C). If properly employed, 
the energy and fluid-thermodynamic effects so produced 
may result in increased cutting speed for a given power  
 
of the laser, improved flushout of the liquefied 
material, and a better surface finish of the cutting 
faces. To understand the chain of events occurring in this 
process, some knowledge is required of the 
fluid-thermodynamics of reactive gases, and the complex 
phenomena produced when such a gas is subjected to 
intense heat by both the laser beam and the liquified 
material, and the mass of the gas stream is increased by 
the presence of the liquid. This results in a gas stream 
consisting of a mixture of compressible gas and 
(incompressible) liquid, with all the possibilities this 
entails. For example, the liquid may be broken down into 
large or small drops, or even atomized. Depending on the amount of heat, particularly that 
radiated by the laser beam and high-temperature solid or 
fluid surfaces, and the combined thermal and 
fluid-dynamic effects involved, the drops and atomized 
liquid particles may be converted into steam, which, 
though undesirable, is nevertheless inevitable. Moreover, due to their small size and the absence of a 
cooling mass (the cold faces of the workpiece), the 
liquid particles within range of the laser beam may also 
be converted into steam, which, like the existing steam, 
may be energized or even ionized by the laser beam, thus 
resulting In several of the luminous phenomena observed 
during the cutting process.  
 In dealing with the above phenomena, the reactivity of 
the gas must also be taken into account. In the case of 
oxygen, if the temperature of the liquid species exceeds 
a given
