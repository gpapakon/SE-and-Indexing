A shower screen with at least one hinged door wing (20) which has one longitudinal 
side provided with a profiled tube (15) receiving the edge of a pane (17), wherein 


said profiled tube (15) is rotatably supported at the ends of a vertical post (1), 
said profiled tube (15) has at least one longitudinal groove (26) integrally formed 
thereon, and 
said post (11) is provided with a catch device (22), which in the closing position of 
said door wing (20) comes into engagement with the or one longitudinal groove of said 

profiled tube (15), 
 
characterized in that 


said profiled tube (15) is substantially a circular profiled tube, 
a first longitudinal groove (26) of said profiled tube (15) is arranged opposite said 
pane (17), 
a second longitudinal groove (25) is arranged at an angle of 90Â° with respect to the 
first longitudinal groove (26), into which said catch device (22) engages in a first 

opening position of said door wing (20), and  
 
said post (11) is provided with said catch means (22) in a central plane of the end wall 
facing towards said profiled tube (15). 
The shower screen of claim 1, characterized in that a third longitudinal groove is 
arranged opposite said second longitudinal groove (25), into which said catch device 

(22) engages in a second opening position of said door wing (20). 
The shower screen of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said catch means (22) has a 
roller (23) or ball resiliently biased towards said profiled tube (15), which is rotatable 

and, in the closing position of said door wing (20), engages said first longitudinal 
groove (26) and, in opening positions of said door wing (20), engages other longitudinal 

grooves (25).
