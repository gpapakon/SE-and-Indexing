<ABSTRACT>
A varying mechanism (VVT) for continuously varying the valve 
timing of an intake valve in a predetermined range is 

provided on a cam shaft in an engine. By controlling the 
VVT, the valve overlap period of the intake valve and an 

exhaust valve is continuously varied in a predetermined 
range, thus adjusting the amount of the internal EGR in 

combustion chambers. When determining that the operational 

load of the engine is small and intermediate based on the 
value of a manifold pressure, an electronic control unit 

(ECU) computes a target value for advancing the valve timing 
with respect to the rotational phase of a crankshaft based on 

a throttle angle, an engine speed, etc. The ECU also 
computes a limit value to restrict the target value in 

accordance with the value of the manifold pressure. When the 
target value is smaller than the limit value, the ECU 

controls the VVT based on the target value. When the target 
value is greater than the limit value, the ECU replaces the 

limit value with target value and controls the VVT based on 
this target value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a valve timing
control apparatus according to the preamble of the enclosed patent claim 1.In the conventional combustion engine, intake and exhaust
valves respectively operate to open and close air-intake and
exhaust passages connected to the individual combustion
chambers. The timing of both valves, likewise that of the
pistons, is controlled by the rotational phase of the
crankshaft. As shown in Fig. 8, during a cycle where the
crankcase angle changes 720 degrees, a short period of time
exists when both valves of a cylinder open at the same time.
This so called valve overlap helps to scavenge burned gases
out of the cylinder and to pull fresh air and fuel into the
cylinder. Consequently, the amount of intake or exhaust gas
in any one of the combustion chambers depends on the angle of
a throttle valve provided in the engine's air-intake passage,
or more specifically, on the speed of the engine at any 
particular time.Various apparatuses are available to ensure a variable valve
timing in order to control the amount intake and exhaust
amounts in the combustion chamber with a greater degree of
freedom. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58-25538
discloses one example of such an apparatus. As illustrated
in Fig. 9, an injector 92 provided in an air-intake passage
93 of an engine 91 injects fuel into the passage 93. An
intake valve 96 and an exhaust valve 97 respectively open,
allowing communication between a combustion chamber 94, the
air-intake passage 93 and an exhaust passage 95. Actuators
98 and 99 drive the valves 96 and 97 respectively. A
computer 100 controls the driving of the injector 92 based on
various parameters detected by individual sensors 101, 102
and 103, and in this way adjusts the amount of fuel injected
into the air-intake passage 93. Based on various engine
operating parameters, the computer 100 also controls the
driving of the individual actuators 98 and 99. This in turn
effects the timing control of the valves 96 and 97.Through the above control, the computer 100 controls the
adjustment of the air-fuel mixture, supplied to the
combustion chamber 94, and thereby controls the output of the
engine 91. Under conditions when the engine's speed is
substantially constant, the computer 100 controls the overlap
of the intake and exhaust valves 96, 97 in such a way that 
allows exhaust gas to recirculate into the combustion chamber
94. The purpose of such Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is
to reduce the amounts of nitrogen oxide contained in
