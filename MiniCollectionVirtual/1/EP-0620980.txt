<ABSTRACT>
A process of producing a texturized protein product 
having a layered meat-like texture and appearance in which 

only vegetable protein material, particularly soy flour, 
and water are used as ingredients. A dough-like slurry of 

soy flour and water is pumped into the gap between a fixed 
plate and a rapidly rotating plate in a high speed emulsion 

mill under conditions which rapidly heat the slurry 
to a temperature above 100° C. to rapidly texturize the 

protein. The hot slurry is pumped under positive pressure 
by centrifugal force from the emulsion mill directly into 

an elongated process tube in which the texturized protein 
slurry rapidly coagulates to form in the tube a continuous 

loaf having distinct parallel layers of soy protein bonded 
together which maintains its structure upon discharge from 

the tube. The continuous loaf is cut into pieces of a 
desired dimension with the pieces having a layered meat-like 

appearance and texture with the pieces retaining 
their shape and layered structure under commercial processing 

conditions including canning, retorting, drying, rehydration, 
freezing, thawing, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of simulated meat products from
vegetable protein materials. More particularly, the invention relates to the
production of texturized vegetable protein products having the layered
appearance, texture and structure of chunks of striated natural meat tissue.In recent years a number of procedures have been proposed for producing
meat analogs from vegetable protein materials, particularly soybeans. Typically
such meat analogs are produced by passing an aqueous soy flour slurry through
an extrusion cooker under predetermined conditions of moisture, time,
temperature and pressure to form an expanded product, or by spinning an
aqueous protein isolate slurry into fibers. Recently the use of steam as a
texturizing agent has been proposed to produce texturized soy protein pieces
intended to simulate meat products.Such prior procedures have not been entirely satisfactory, however, since
the texturized protein products produced lack the texture, appearance, physical
structure and mouthfeel of natural meat. For example, meat analogs produced by
steam. texturizing soy protein have a texture and appearance similar to cooked
ground beef rather than that of striated or skeletal muscle tissue. Prior
procedures have been unable to impart to texturized protein products the texture,
appearance and physical structure of natural meat pieces. This inability to
produce texturized vegetable protein which simulate chunks of natural meat is a
primary reason for the lack of widespread consumer acceptance of currently
available meat analog products. In addition, prior procedures typically have
employed such complex equipment and operations that production costs have
made the resulting meat analog products commercially unattractive, despite the
relatively inexpensive nature of the starting material. European patent publication 0265740 describes a process for producing a
layered meat emulsion from meat material. The meat material is comminuted,
rapidly heated, and introduced into a confined zone by centrifugal force. The
material is maintained in the confined zone until coagulated. The meat emulsion
has a striated, meat-like appearance.European patent publication 0385266 describes a process for producing a
product from soy protein which has a meat-like texture, appearance and
firmness. Soy beans are hydrated, acidified, and comminuted to provide an
aqueous dispersion. The dispersion is introduced into a confined treatment zone
and heated using injected steam to texturise the protein into

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a texturized vegetable protein product having the
texture and appearance of striated, natural meat chunks, which comprises


mixing finely divided untextured vegetable protein material and water to
form a slurry having a total solids content of 35% to 50% by weight,

rapidly heating said slurry to a temperature above 100°C, to effect rapid
texturization of the protein,
introducing the heated slurry at a temperature above 100°C under positive
pressure by centrifugal force into a process tube in which the texturized protein

rapidly coagulates to form in the process tube a continuous protein loaf having
distinct parallel layers of texturized protein bonded together, with the layers

being oriented generally perpendicular to the direction of flow of the slurry
through the tube,
cooling the protein loaf while retaining the protein loaf in the process tube
until the layers of texturized protein have set sufficiently to form a firm product

which retains its layered structure when discharged from the process tube and the
temperature of the protein loaf has fallen to below the saturated steam

temperature,
discharging the protein loaf from the process tube, and
cutting the protein loaf into pieces of a desired dimension, said pieces
having a plurality of distinct layers of texturized vegetable protein bonded

together.
The process defined in claim 1 in which the vegetable protein material is
soy flour having a protein content of about 40% to 50% by weight.
The process defined in claim 2 in which the soy flour is mixed with water
which has been acidified with sufficient edible acid to provide the slurry with a

pH in the range of 4.6 to 5.4.
The process defined in claim 3 in which the slurry has a pH of between
about 5.0 and 5.4.
The process defined in any of claims 1 to 4 in which the slurry is rapidly
heated and introduced into the process tube by pumping the slurry through a gap 

maintained between a fixed plate and a rapidly rotating plate in a high speed
emulsion mill whereby the slurry is rapidly heated by mechanical energy.

and a pressure in the range of 3 to 9 bars.
The process defined in claim 8 in which the protein loaf is retained in the
process tube until the temperature and pressure of the protein loaf does not
