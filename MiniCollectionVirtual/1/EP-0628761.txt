<ABSTRACT>
The plastic container (1) foresees an inside space (2) with three 
ducts communicated with outside: an inlet duct (3) and a vent duct 

(4) both with screw thread and a third outlet duct (5) with external 
thread. The inlet duct and the vent duct (4) to be closed with blind 

nipples (6 and 7) with upper gripping tongues and the outlet (5) 
to be closed with a gripping nipple (8) with inside thread. For 

using the invented means, with the inlet duct (3) and the vent duct 
(4) opened the container (1) is put under the vehicle having the 

attention to put the inlet duct (3) approximately in vertical correspondence 
with the oil exhaust foresees in the motor vehicle. Opened 

said oil exhaust of the motor the residual oil comes to fall down 
into the converging potting (9) and then it comes to the inside space 

(2) of the container (1) through the inlet duct (3). When all the 
residual oil is collected, the container (1) can be manually lifted 

by means of its handle (11) and it is gravitationally discharged 
opening the outlet duct (5) by unscrewing its nipple (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a container with an inside space to be closed 
for collecting the residual oils of the motor, particularly to be 
used by the driver of the motor vehicle, which can be directly 
used to collect the residual oil from the motor and to keep the same 
inside said container so permitting its transport to a pre-arranged 
point for its right disposal. The invented container can be used 
to whoever acts with motor vehicles, for their servicing of other, 
and when he has not access to the services of resiual oils collecting. The invention resolves a working problem for whoever must change 
the used oil into one's own motor vehicle. To avoid big ecological 
damages which come to put into the conventional discharges of into 
the sewerages said residual goods highly polluting, the laws in force 
impose to the sector companies, such as petrol stations or repairing 
stations, to use suited means to recover the residual oils. Said 
residual oils are normally collect from the repairing stations or 
other points by a firm commited to this collecting service. This 
collecting oil problem, which now is not more present between the 
sector workers, is instead present for the operator no ables to have 
access to these services and in particular for the ordinary driver 
who is going to change the motor oil of his own vehicle. At present 
to do this it is necessary as a first step to put a collecting basin 
on the ground under the oil exhaust of the motor of the vehicle,  
 
to open said exhaust and, when the oil flow is ended, to take the 
basin and, grasping it and by means of a funnel, to pour the oil 
into a container which can be closed such as a plastic tank to permit 
the ordinary transport to suited collecting point. It is easy to 
understand the working difficulty of the above cited sequence in 
particular for the ordinary operator, such is to be consider the 
driver, who besides to have a lot of difficulties will end by dirtying 
himself. Moreover it must be considered that this current sequence 
needs of three means: a basin for the oil collecting, a funnel for 
the pouring off and a tank for the oil transport, means that, on 
the base ot their particular use, cannot be used for other sevices 
and consequently theyself come to form polluting means. The invented 
means permits a solution of this current problem foreseen a new means 
to be used as a first step as collecting means to be put on the ground, 
under the body vehicle, for the residual oil and then as container 
to be manually closed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Collecting container for residual oil of the motor vehicles in 
plastic material with inside space (2) equipped with three ducts communicated 

with outside: a first screw thread inlet duct (3), a second 
screw thread vent duct (4) and a third outlet duct (5) with external 

thread; the first inlet duct (3) to be closed with blind nipple (6) 
with upper gripping tongue , the second vent duct (4) to be closed 

with blind nipple (7) with upper gripping tongue and the outlet duct 
(5) to be closed with a gripping nipple (8) with inside thread; with 

potting (9) converging to the central inlet duct (3) with its upper 
part delimited by a border (10); characterized in that for using, 

with the inlet duct (3) and the vent duct (4) opened, the container 
is put on the ground under the vehicle having the attention to put 

the inlet duct (3) approximately in vertical correspondence with the 
oil exhaust foresees in the motor vehicle; opened the oil exahaust 

of the motor the residual oil comes to fall down into the converging 
potting (9) and it comes to the inside space (2) of the container 

(1) through the inlet duct (3); when all residual oil is collected 
and after to have taken out the container (1), the inside space (2) 

is closed by means of nipples (6 and 7). 
Collecting container for residual oil of the motor vehicles, according 
to claim 1), in which the residual oil eventually presents onto the 

converging point (9) is taken away by means of paper or other. 
Collecting container for residual oil of the motor vehicles, according 
to claim 1), where the container (1) can be manually lifted by means 

of its handle (11) and it can be transported to the residual oil collecting 
point. 
Collecting container for residual oil of the motor vehicles, according 
to claim 1), characterized by that within the collecting point the 

oil into the container (1) can be gravitationally discharged opening 
the inside space (2) by unscrewing the nipple (8) opens the outlet 

duct (5). 
Collecting container for residual oil of the motor vehicles, according 
to claim 1), in that to avoid the cleaning of the residual oil on the 

 
potting (9), after that the oil is fallen down into the inside space 

(2), can be used as auxiliary means a funnel to be disposed into the 
inlet duct (3) and with its potting shape equal to the converting potting 

(9) to permit the funnel positioning on the potting surface.
