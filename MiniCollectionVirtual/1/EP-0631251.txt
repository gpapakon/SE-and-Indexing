<ABSTRACT>
A graphics correction method is applicable to 
graphic-element data comprising a plurality of line 

segments and circular arcs. When graphic elements that 
should originally be interconnected cross or become 

separated from each other, the offset between graphic 
elements is corrected automatically. This saves a great 

amount of time in comparison with that needed for 
redrawing of the graphic elements. The method includes 

a topology recognition step of recognizing the topology 
of the graphic elements, a geometric-parameter 

alteration step of correcting the offset of graphic 
elements by altering geometric parameters, which define 

each graphic element, with regard to all graphic 
elements while maintaining the topology thereof, and an 

end-point decision step of deciding end points 
accompanied by enlargement/reduction of the graphic 

elements. The method may further include a parameter-setting 
step of setting a connection parameter, which is 

necessary in order to obtain at least the connected 
state between graphic elements, and a maximum amount of 

alteration of the geometric parameters of the graphic 
elements, or an error-information output step of 

outputting error information generated at the geometric-parameter 
alteration step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a graphics correction
method through which an offset between graphic elements
as created by a CAD system or the like can be corrected
automatically, as well as to a system employing this
method.When graphic elements that should originally be
interconnected in graphics as created by a CAD system
become separated from each other owing to a computer
calculation error or as the result of human error, it is
necessary to redraw the graphic elements because they
cannot be traced automatically as at the time of closed-loop
creation. Since this offset is extremely small, it
is very difficult to visually ascertain the locations
that should be corrected. Moreover, graphic elements
that should be corrected are fairly numerous and
correcting them requires an enormous amount of time.Though there are systems having a correction
function for connecting separated graphic elements,
these systems merely determine the point of intersection
between graphic elements and adopts this position as the 
point of connection. As a result, it is impossible to deal
with cases in which a point of intersection cannot be
calculated.Furthermore, WO-A-90 14641 (EXCELLON IND. INC.) discloses a method for
generating mask transparencies for the mass production of printed circuits boards using a laser
photoplotting system and including an algorithm for mapping geometric entities from the
continuous plane such as is used in vector photoplotting to a pixel graphic representation of the
geometric entities. The method reduces offset errors between rectangular entities and circular
entities in phototool primitives constructed in the discrete pixel graphic system by selecting a
pixel to represent the corner of the rectangular entity that is closest to the circumference of the
circular entity.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a graphic correction method, and a system employing
this method, in which an offset between graphic elements
can be corrected automatically.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a graphic correction method, and a system employing this
method, in which error information at the time of
correction is communicated to make possible judgment of the
suitability of a correction or to enable correction by the
operator.In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present
invention provides a graphic correction method, and a system
employing this method, as outlined in the attached claims. Other features and advantages of the present invention
will be apparent from the
