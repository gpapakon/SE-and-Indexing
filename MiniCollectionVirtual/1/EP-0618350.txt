<ABSTRACT>
A tappet is used in a valve operating mechanism of 
a direct acting type in an internal combustion engine. A 

tip engaged with a center bore of an inner upper surface 
of a tappet body comprises upper and lower convex surfaces 

and a rounded upper circumferential corner having a 
certain curvature, thereby preventing concentration of 

stress even if the tip is subject to high compression 
load. Thus, durability and reliablity of the tappet are 

increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tappet for use 
in a valve-operating mechanism of a direct-acting type in 
an internal combustion engine and a method of 
manufacturing the tappet. In order to increase allowable maximum speed and 
maximum brake power in an engine, DOHC-type engines have 
been used. Also, in order to lighten the valve operating 
system, a tappet (valve lifter) for use in the valve 
operating system has been made of aluminum alloy, instead 
of conventional steel, such as in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Pub. No.1-315607. Aluminum alloy tappets have strength, rigidity and 
wear resistance lower than those in steel tappets, so that 
wear resistant metal has been generally applied to a 
contact surface between a rotary cam and the axial end of 
an engine valve. Fig. 3 illustrates a known tappet in a valve 
operating mechanism of a direct acting type, in which 1 
denotes a cylinder head; and 2 denotes a tappet body 
which slidably contacts the cylinder head 1 and comprises 
a cylinder the upper end of which is closed. With a 
larger diameter recess 2a and a smaller diameter engage 
bore 2b formed at the upper surface and inner surface 
respectively in the tappet body 2 are engaged a wear  
 
resistant metal circular shim 3 and a smaller diameter tip 
4 respectively. The lower surface of the tip 4 contacts the axial 
end of an engine valve 8 connected with the cylinder head 
1 by a pair of cotters 5 and 5, a spring retainer 6, a 
valve spring 7, etc. The upper surface of the shim 3 
slidably contacts a rotary cam 9 the center of which is 
disposed on an axis of the engine valve 8. In the foregoing tappet used in the direct-acting 
valve operating mechanism, driving force by the rotary cam 
9 acts against the tip 4 as high compression load 
repeatedly. Therefore, when the upper and lower surfaces 
of the tip 4 are formed to be flat and the corners of the 
tip 4 engaged within the engage bore 2b are formed as a 
right angle, stress is concentrated to the corners, 
thereby causing a crack 10 as shown in Fig. 3. The outer circumference of the tappet body 2 is 
worn, thereby causing abnormal operation such as 
clattering and surging, so that the axial end of the 
engine valve 8 partially contacts the lower surface of the 
tip 4, thereby causing one-sided wear at the contact 
surface. In order to overcome the foregoing disadvantages, 
the object of the invention is to provide a durable and 
reliable tappet and a method of manufacturing it while 
preventing concentration of stress to a tip engage
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tappet for use in an internal combustion 
engine, comprising: 


a cylindrical tappet body (2) closed at an upper end and having an 
engage bore (2b) at a center of an inner upper surface; and 
a tip (11) which is fitted in the engage 
bore (2b), a lower surface of the tip (11) contacting an axial end 

of an engine valve (8), characterized in that the 
tip (11) has upper and lower convex surfaces 

and a rounded upper circumferential corner (11a) having a 
certain curvature. 
A method of manufacturing a tappet as defined in 
claim 1, comprising the steps of: 


forming an engage bore (2b) having a flat upper surface 
at a center of an inner upper surface of a plastically 

deformable cylindrical tappet body (2) which is closed at an 
upper end; 
inserting a tip (11) having upper and lower convex 
surfaces and a rounded upper circumferential corner (11a) having 

a certain curvature into the engage bore (2b); 
pressing the tip strongly until the inner upper 
surface of the engage bore (2b) is plastically deformed to form 

a concave surface corresponding to an upper surface of the 
tip (11) and to caulk a downward circumferential projection (12) 

around the engage bore (2b) inwardly.
