<ABSTRACT>
This invention is concerned primarily with scanning at 
multiple vertical resolutions using an essentially single 

speed scanner (11, 12) without having to use complex digital 
image processing to do resolution conversions. The invention 

accomplishes the multiple resolution scanning by a 
combination of rejecting certain lines of data and making 

relatively small adjustments to the paper velocity,

<DESCRIPTION>
Technical Field. This invention generally relates to
scanning mechanisms for digital imaging scanners, facsimile
machines and the like. More particularly, this invention
concerns a method and an apparatus for scanning at multiple
vertical resolutions, using the same scanning mechanism,
with relatively small, or limited, changes in the vertical
scanning velocity.Background. Digital imaging has seen a proliferation
of resolution standards. Currently there are three resolution
standards which have gained wide acceptance in the
industry, which is due mainly to their acceptance in the
market place. Resolutions of 204 x 98 dots per inch (DPI)
and 204 x 196 DPI have become the standards in group 3
facsimile transmission devices while a resolution of 300 x
300 DPI is the current standard for document printing and
desktop publishing. Newer printing technologies should
result in higher resolutions such as 600 x 600 DPI, 900 x
900 DPI or even 1200 x 1200 DPI becoming standard.Unfortunately, as desirable as it may be, it is difficult
to design a scanning device which is capable of scanning
at all of the various resolutions and to thereby enable
the consumer to purchase a single device which will satisfy
all scanning needs, e.g. capable of scanning at 204 x 98 DPI
or 204 x 196 DPI for sending a fax, or at 300 x 300 DPI or
600 x 600 DPI for importing graphics into computer generated
documents.To date the solution to the problem has been to scan an
image at a given resolution and then "process" the image to
convert it to the desired resolution and/or size. Digital
image processing, as the phrase is used here, refers to the
process of mathematically assigning a value to each pixel of 
the image representing its tone or greyscale value, and then
either averaging groups of pixels to obtain a "super" pixel,
or conversely, letting each pixel represent a "super" pixel,
which is subsequently translated into a larger group of
pixels, depending upon whether the conversion is to either a
lower or higher resolution, respectively. Additional processing
techniques can be used to refine the image using
various algorithms, which are well known.Unfortunately, even simple digital processing techniques
require tremendous amounts of processor time and
computing capacity. This constraint has prevented "real
time" faxing from high resolution scanners, i.e. where the
documents are scanned as the data is being communicated.
Instead, all of the pages of a particular transmission are
first scanned into the memory of the device, converted to
