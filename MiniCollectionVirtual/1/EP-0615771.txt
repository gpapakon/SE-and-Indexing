<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for operating a fire extinguishing system having a gaseous extinguishing agent stored in a plurality of high-pressure gas cylinders. The first cylinder (2) of a set of cylinders is designed as a control or pilot cylinder and is set up in such a way that it opens the following cylinders by means of its highly pressurised gas. The control cylinder and the following cylinders are each provided with a directly controlled piston valve (7), the control line (12) starting from the control valve opening out into branch lines (13) to the following cylinder valves or into a collecting line. From the cylinder valves, discharge lines (18-21) are conducted in each case to the collecting line (22).

Device for operating a fire-extinguishing means using a
gaseous fire-extinguishing substance stored in a plurality

of gas bottles (3 - 6), wherein a gas-containing control
bottle (2) provided with a control valve (7) is provided

upstream of the gas bottles (3 - 6), the control valve (7)
being provided with a control line (12; 22; 38) connected

via branch lines (13 - 16; 39 - 42) with the bottle valves
(8 - 11) of the succeeding gas bottles (3 - 6), wherein a

respective discharge line (18 - 21; 39 - 42) runs from
each bottle valve (8 - 11) to a manifold (22), and wherein

the control valve (7) and the bottle valves (8 - 11) each
are provided with a release device,
characterized in that
the bottle valves (8 - 11) each comprise a directly controlled
piston valve provided with a screw-on cap (27)

having a control terminal stud (26), and that the control
valve (7) comprises a directly controlled piston valve

with a screwed-on cap with release device (28).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that a
pneumatic delay means (29) is provided between the control

valve (7) and the first bottle valve (8).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the control bottle (
2) as a pilot bottle is filled with
fire-extinguishing gas, and that between the first 

junction of the first branch line (13) and the manifold
(22) inside the control line (12) and/or behind the last

bottle valve (11) a throttle element (32) with non-return
safety mechanism is installed.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the
throttle element is configured as double non-return valve

(70).
Device according to one of claims 1 - 4, characterized in
that the connections for the branch lines (13 - 16) are

configured as T-sections with the control line (12)
between the individual connectors being made up of hoses

attached to the ends of the T-sections.
Device according to one of claims 1 - 5, characterized in
that the branch lines (39 - 42) simultaneously act as discharge

lines, that the control bottle (2) as a pilot
bottle is filled with fire-extinguishing gas, that the

discharge line (38) provided with a non-return safety
mechanism (45) leads from the control valve (7) to the

manifold (22) from where the branch lines (39 - 42) lead
to the bottle valves (8 - 11), and that the manifold (22)

comprises at least two throttles (43, 44).
Device according to one of claims 1 - 6, characterized in
that the discharge lines (18 - 21) comprise non-return

safety mechanisms (34 - 37).
Device according to one of claims 1 - 7, provided with a
piston valve comprising a valve body (46) with inner bore

(47) and a threaded connecting piece (55) to be screwed
onto the control and gas bottles (2; 3 - 6) as well as a

terminal stud (26) for the control gas and a discharge 
connecting piece (53) for the control or the fire-extinguishing

gas as well as control piston (48) movable
in the bore (47) of the valve body (46) with the control

piston carrying at its lower end a valve plate (51) with
seal (51a), wherein the valve body (46) is closable by a

cap (27) having a terminal stud (26), characterized in
that the piston rod (50) carries the valve plate (51) with

seal (51a) at its lower end, which can be pressed by the
control or fire-extinguishing gas in the bottle against a

valve seat (52) of the valve body (46), and that the
piston rod (50) comprises a reduced cross-section (54) in

the area of the discharge connecting piece (53).
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that in the
valve body (46) below the valve plate (51) a connecting

piece (57) for a pressure meter and/or a bypass line (58)
is laterally provided and, approximately on the same

plane, a connecting piece (57a) for a rapture disk (57b)
or similar is provided in staggered arrangement relative

to the former.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the
double non-return valve (70) comprises a valve body (59)

with connecting piece (60) and discharge connecting piece
(61), a lower valve closing element (62) with spring (63)

and an upper sealing element (64) with spring (65), and
that bypass ducts (66) with lower distribution chamber

(68) and upper overflow ducts (67) are provided which are
sealed to the outside via the springs (63, 65) by means of

the closing element (62) and the sealing element (64)
respectively when the gas bottle is closed. 
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that the
sealing element (64) is configured with the upper diameter

D and a lower diameter d, where D
