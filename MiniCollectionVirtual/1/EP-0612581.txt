<ABSTRACT>
Welding head for making welds on the periphery of essentially cylindrical workpieces, comprising two tool-body segments (7, 8), which can be closed around the workpieces and have clamping devices (19, 20) for clamping and positioning the workpieces, and a welding tool which can be rotationally driven relative to the welding head and in the process orbits the workpieces. According to the invention, the welding tool is arranged on a rotary ring which encloses the workpiece periphery and is composed of at least two ring segments.

A welding head for applying welds to the circumference 
of substantially cylindrical workpieces, with at least two 

tool body segments (7,8) which can be closed around the 
workpieces and which have clamping means (19,20) for 

clamping and positioning the workpieces, and with a welding 
tool (45) which can be driven to rotate relative to the 

welding head and which thus rotates around the workpiece, 
characterised in that the welding tool (45) is mounted on a 

rotary ring (3) which completely surrounds the workpiece 
circumference and which is composed of at least two annular 

segments (4,5). 
A welding head according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the inscribed angle at the circumference occupied by 

each annular segment (4,5) corresponds to the inscribed 
angle at the circumference occupied by one tool body segment 

(7,8). 
A welding head according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the rotary ring is in the form of a 

toothed ring (3) with a tooth rim arranged on the outer 
circumference. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the rotary ring (3) adjoins at its end 

face a split guide ring (12) which is fixed relative to the 
welding head and the pitch of which corresponds to the pitch 

of the tool body segments (7,8) which can be closed around 
the workpieces. 
A welding head according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that an axially resilient split pressure ring (14) is 

applied against the end face of the rotary ring (3) remote  
 

from the guide ring (12), the spacing of which pressure ring 
corresponds to the spacing of the tool body segments (7,8) 

which can be closed around the workpieces. 
A welding head according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that at least one segment of the guide ring 

(12) has cooling means (44). 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that the rotary ring (3) and/or the guide 

ring (12) have in their adjoining end faces an annular 
recess (33) into which a feed duct for protective gas opens 

which is fixed to the tool, wherein the rotary ring (3) has 
at least one outlet duct connected with the recess (33) and 

serving to convey the protective gas to the welding point. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that the rotary ring (3), the guide ring 

(12) and the clamping means (19,20) consist of electrically 
conductive material, and in that the rotary ring and the 

guide ring (3,12), on the one hand, and the clamping means 
(19,20), on the other hand, are electrically insulated from 

one another, wherein the guide ring (12) is connected to the 
welding current supply and the clamping means (19,20) is 

connected to earth. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the clamping means (19,20) are 

interchangeable. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that a control means (34,35) for 

determining the angular position of the rotary ring (3) is 
provided. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that the rotary ring (3) is connected with 

a shoulder member (38) which projects axially from the 
welding head and on which a welding electrode holder (40,42)  

 
is mounted outside the welding head, wherein the shoulder 

member (38) has a duct connected with the outlet duct of the 
rotary ring (3) for supplying protective gas to the welding 

point. 
A welding head according to Claim 11, characterised in 
that the location of the welding electrode holder (40,42) is 

adjustable relative to the rotary ring (3). 
A welding head according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterised in that the electrode holder (40,42) is 

mounted resiliently on the shoulder member (38), and in that 
its spacing from the workpiece surface is determined by an 

adjustable spacer (43) applied to the workpiece surface 
under the spring force. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the clamping means are in the form of 

clamping jaws (19,20) which, in the closed condition of the 
welding head, form together with the tool body a chamber 

enclosing the welding zone. 
A welding head according to any one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the clamping means (19,20) and the 

tool body segments (7,8) are designed to be opened and 
closed independently of one another.
