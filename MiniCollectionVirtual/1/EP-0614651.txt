<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic wave medical treatment apparatus capable 
of preventing the displacement of the focal point (7) of the 

ultrasonic waves from the treatment target portion (8) within 
the patient (3), eliminating a need for re-positioning of the 

ultrasonic wave applicator (1) with respect to the patient (3), and 
taking MR images to be utilized during the treatment at a 

high resolution. In this apparatus, the ultrasonic wave 
applicator (1) can be integrally incorporated within a 

treatment table (22) for carrying the patient into the MRI 
gantry (25) for taking the MR images. The surface coil for 

taking the MR images can be provided on a surface film of a 
water bag (5) in the ultrasonic wave applicator (1), or on a body 

cavity probe on which the ultrasonic transducer (2) is also 
provided. The mixing rate of the coupling fluid can be 

adjusted, and the impedance matching between the ultrasonic 
transducer (2) and the driving circuit (12) can be maintained by 

minimizing the reflected electric power from the ultrasonic 
transducer (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic wave
medical treatment apparatus for treating treatment targets
such as tumors, calculi, etc. inside a living body by
applying intense ultrasonic waves from an outside of the
living body or a body cavity of the living body, under the
guidance of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from WO-A-91/11958.In recent years, for a treatment of the calculosis,
much attention has been attracted to a lithotriptor for
destroying calculi inside a living body non-invasively by
externally applying intense ultrasonic waves focused on the
calculi.Also, for a treatment of the tumors, much attention
has ben attracted to a hyperthermia for heating the tumor
tissues at the temperature over 42.5 °C, and a thermal
treatment for causing a thermal degeneration by heating at
the high temperature over 60 °C.In order to carry out these treatments, there are many
propositions for an apparatus for focusing the intense
ultrasonic waves generated outside of the living body onto
a treatment target portion within the living body, and
thermally treating a cancer by the heat generation of the
cancer tissue due to the absorption of the ultrasonic
energy, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,620,546, and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 5-137733
(1993). This latter reference proposes a unified
configuration of the lithotritor and a thermal treatment 
apparatus, noting that these tow apparatuses have similar
structures.On the other hand, the researches are also carried out
for a treatment method to kill the cancer tissue by the
mechanical force of the pulse shaped shock waves having
sufficient intensity to destroy the calculi which are
irradiated onto the cancer, as disclosed in Hoshi, S. et
al.: "High Energy Underwater Shock Wave Treatment on
Implanted Urinary Bladder Cancer in Rabbits", Journal of
Urology, Vol. 146, pp. 439-443, August, 1991.Now, in positioning the focus in such a cancer
treatment apparatus, the two dimensional ultrasound
tomographic images are usually utilized, but this use of
the two dimensional tomographic images makes it very
difficult to carry out a thorough treatment of the entire
tumor as the actual tumor often has a complicated three
dimensional shape. For this reason, there has been a
proposition to employ the three dimensional ultrasound
images instead of the ultrasound tomographic images as
disclosed in European Patent No. 0 194 897.However, in the ultrasound images, the region behind
