<ABSTRACT>
A factor isolated from striated or smooth muscle 
tissue or muscle cell culture inhibits proliferation of 

tumor cells, such as ESB, HT-29 and B-16 F1 cell lines, 
as well as the peripheral white blood cells of a patient 

with chronic myeloid leukemia. The active fraction may 
have a molecular weight in the range of 25-30,000 

daltons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a factor which 
inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. Inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells is one 
of the main purposes of the therapy, especially the 
chemotherapy, of cancerous growths. A particular aspect 
of such proliferation is the phenomenon whereby some 
cells of the tumor break off into the bloodstream and 
travel to other parts of the body, where they produce 
secondary tumors; this phenomenon is termed metastasis. 
As is well-known, while there are many tumor-inhibiting 
substances either in actual use, or which have potential 
use, in the chemotherapy of cancer, nevertheless the 
problem of cancer as a whole is far from a solution. 
Thus, any new contribution to the art of chemotherapy 
provides the medical profession with an additional tool 
with which to fight this disease. As will be seen from 
the following description, the present invention provides 
a substance of biological origin which is believed to be 
useful in this context. EP-A-159276 discloses substantially purified 
polypeptide factors capable of inhibiting the growth of 
certain cancer cells and discloses such a factor obtained 
from serum-free medium derived from a human tumor cell 
line.  It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
tumor cell proliferation inhibition factor. According to the present invention there is provided 
a tumor cell proliferation inhibition factor isolable 
from at least one material selected from the group 
consisting of striated or smooth muscle tissue and muscle 
cells. This factor serves to inhibit the growth of melanoma, 
adenocarcinoma, leukemia and lymphoma cells. This factor may be obtained by culturing cells 
separated from muscle tissue, and particularly from the 
supernatant of such culture. This factor may have a 
molecular weight substantially in the range of from 
25,000 to 30,000 daltons. The muscle tissue may be, e.g. 
that of new-born rats.  For purposes of definition, it is to be noted that 
the term "proliferation" in the present specification and 
claims is intended to include metastasis, but is not 
limited thereto. Figure 1 illustrates the effect on ESB cells of 
muscle cells, in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 illustrates the effect on ESB cells of 
muscle supernatant, in accordance with the invention. Figure 3 illustrates the effect on HTB cells of the 
proliferation inhibition factor according to the 
invention. Figure 4 illustrates the effect on B-16 F1 cells of 
the said proliferation inhibition factor.
