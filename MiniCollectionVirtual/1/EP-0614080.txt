<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus for 
recognizing the shape of a semiconductor wafer, capable 

of stably achieving accurate shape recognition without 
being affected by a circuit pattern formed on the 

semiconductor wafer. The shape recognizing apparatus in 
accordance with the present invention comprises an 

illuminating means (1) for illuminating a semiconductor 
wafer (100), an image pickup means (3) for picking up an 

image of the semiconductor wafer (100) and providing 
video signals representing the image, disposed so that 

specular light reflected by the semiconductor wafer 
(100) will not fall thereon, and a shape recognizing 

means (6) which processes the video signals to recognize 

the shape of the semiconductor wafer (100), a first 
polarizing means (7) is disposed on a light path along 

which the illuminating light emitted by the illuminating 
means (1) travels, and a second polarizing means (8) is 

placed on a path along which reflected light from the 
semiconductor wafer (100) travels toward the image 

pickup means (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
recognizing the shape of a semiconductor wafer, capable 
of automatically recognizing the shape of a 
semiconductor wafer when the semiconductor wafer is 
being processed on a dicing apparatus or the like to 
enable the dicing apparatus or the like to process and 
handle the semiconductor wafer accurately and 
efficiently according to the shape of the semiconductor 
wafer even if the semiconductor wafer is chipped or 
cracked. After fabricating a plurality of semiconductor 
chips on the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the 
semiconductor wafer is subjected to inspection to 
inspect the semiconductor chips with an IC tester 
provided with a prober and to a dicing process on a 
dicing apparatus. In automatically processing the 
semiconductor wafer, the automatic process is designed 
to align the semiconductor wafer automatically on an 
assumption that the semiconductor wafer is circular. 
The following explanation will be made in connection 
with a dicing apparatus by way of example. The dicing 
apparatus, which cuts narrow grooves in the surface of 
the semiconductor wafer with a cutting blade rotating 
at a high speed, is widely used for cutting the 
semiconductor wafer into semiconductor chips. The pattern of the semiconductor chips fabricated 
on the surface of the semiconductor wafer cannot be 
correctly positioned relative to the working position 
of the cutting blade by simply mounting the 
semiconductor wafer on the stage and hence the grooves 
cannot be accurately cut along desired lines on the  
 
semiconductor wafer without adjusting the position of 
the semiconductor wafer relative to the cutting blade. 
The position of the semiconductor wafer relative to the 
working position of the cutting blade is adjusted by 
moving the stage supporting the semiconductor wafer 
into the field of view of an image pickup device and 
bringing a specified position on the semiconductor wafer 
into alignment with a specified position in the field 
of view of a projector. The projector is located 
beforehand at a predetermined position relative to the 
working position of the cutting blade. After thus 
determining the positional relation between the 
specified position on the surface of the semiconductor 
wafer and the working position of the cutting blade, the 
stage is moved by a precision stage moving mechanism to 
cut grooves accurately along the desired lines on the 
semiconductor wafer. The operation to adjust the 
position of the semiconductor wafer
