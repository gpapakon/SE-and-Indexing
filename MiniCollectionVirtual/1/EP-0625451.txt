Steering anti-theft device for a motor vehicle comprising 
a locking member or bolt (22) pivotally mounted in a casing 

(10) fixed to a steering column, the pivoting of the locking 
member or bolt (22) occurring in a direction perpendicular to 

the axis of a lock assembly (12) provided with a control cam 
equipped with a pull (18) and control means suitable for 

causing the bolt (22) to move from a locking position to an 
unlocking position, consisting of a connection member or slide 

(34) fixed to the pull (18) and able to move in translation 
parallel to the axis of the lock assembly (12), characterised 

in that
 
the connection member or slide (34) is fixed with respect to 

rotation to the casing (10), the movement of the locking 
member or bolt (22) from the said locking position to the said 

unlocking position being obtained by translation without 
rotation of the connection member or slide (34),
 
in that the locking member or bolt (22) comprises at one of 

its ends a swivel (32) suitable for cooperating with an axial 
groove (46) formed in the connection member or slide (34)
 
and in that the axial groove (46) has an entry (48) which is 

splayed by means of two bevels (50, 52). 
Anti-theft device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the axial groove (46) has a first step (54) connected to 

a second step (58) by a ramp (56). 
Anti-theft device according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the width (e) of the steps (54, 58) is substantially 

equal to the diameter of the swivel (32) of the locking member 
or bolt (22).  

 
Anti-theft device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that guide means for the slide (34) formed by a sleeve (42) 

formed in the casing (10). 
Anti-theft device according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the sleeve (42) has internal guide grooves (44).
