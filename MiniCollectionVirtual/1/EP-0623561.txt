<ABSTRACT>
Process and device for continuous decontamination of a liquid effluent polluted with one or more contaminants consisting of cations (2) of at least one metal. A first complexant is added to the liquid effluent to form a first complex salt (6) of the said metal which has a specified minimum molecular size. The liquid effluent is then separated from the first complex salt on a first semipermeable membrane (9) and a decomplexation of the first complex salt recovered (12) is then performed and the first complexant thus recovered (16) is separated from the cations (17) of the said metal on a second semipermeable membrane (20) to form a permeate (23) which is then subjected to electrolysis to recover the metal.

Process for continuous decontamination of a 
liquid effluent polluted by one or more contaminants 

consisting of cations (2) of at least one metal, in 
which: 


a first complexant is added to the liquid effluent 
to form a first complex salt (
6) of the said metal 
exhibiting a determined minimum molecular size, 
the liquid effluent is separated from the first 
complex salt on a first semipermeable membrane (9) 

whose cutoff threshold is lower than the determined 
minimum molecular size, to form, on one side, a first 

permeate (10) constituting the decontaminated liquid 
effluent and, on the other side, a first retentate (11) 

containing the first complex salt thus recovered (12), 
and 
an electrolysis of a solution originating from the 
first retentate, called solution to be electrolysed, is 

carried out, to recover the said metal (29), 
 
characterized in that, after the separation between the 

liquid effluent and the first complex salt, 

a decomplexing of the first complex salt recovered 
(12) is performed, and  

 
the first complexant thus recovered (16) is 
separated from the cations (17) of the said metal on a 

second semipermeable membrane (20) whose cutoff 
threshold is lower than the minimum molecular size of 

the first complexant recovered, to form, on one side, a 
second retentate (21) containing the said recovered 

first complexant (16), which is reemployed, and, on the 
other side, a second permeate (23) to give the said 

solution to be electrolysed. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, after separation of the recovered first 

complexant (16) from the cations (17) of the metal, a 
second complexing of the said cations is performed by 

adding (25) a second complexant suited to promoting the 
speed of purification by electrolysis of the second 

complex salt thus formed (26) and the second complexant 
(26') is recovered from the said electrolysis, which is 

reemployed for the said second complexing. 
Application of the process according to Claim 2 
to the recovery of nickel. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that simultaneously with the decomplexing of the first 

complexant, a second complexing of the cations of the 
said metal is performed by adding (34) a second 

complexant suited to promoting the speed of 
purification by electrolysis of the second complex salt 

thus formed (26), before separation of the first 
complexant (16) from the said second complex salt (26) 

on the second membrane (20), to form the said solution 
to be electrolysed, and
 
the second complexant (26') is recovered from the 

electrolysis, which is reemployed for the said second 
complexing.
