and/or reproduction of information, having a guide frame (8) arranged on a 

cassette drive chassis (7) in a fixed position, having a cassette receiving device 
(10) which can be moved between a loading position, in which a cassette (1) can 

be introduced into the cassette receiving device (10) and removed therefrom, and, 
an operating position, in which the recording or reproduction of information is 

carried out, wherein the cassette (1) is positioned on the drive chassis (7) by 
means of positioning pins (111a; 111b) and catch apertures (6e; 6f) formed on 

the cassette housing, having means using the catch apertures (6e; 6f) for locking 
the cassette (1) during its transportation between the loading and the operating 

position and also for centring it in the operating position, and having means for 
driving and controlling the cassette receiving device 
(10) between the loading and 
the operating positions, 
characterized in that
, instead of a fixed arrangement on 
the drive chassis (7), the positioning pins (111a; 111b) are fixed on a first 

pivoted lever (11) which is pivotally mounted on the cassette receiving device (1) 
and which can be pivoted into a first position, in which the positioning pins 

(111a; 111b) release the cassette (1) so that the cassette (1) can be introduced 
into the cassette receiving device (10) and removed therefrom, and can be 

pivoted into a second position, in which the positioning pins (111a; 111b) engage 
with the catch apertures (6e; 6f) of the cassette (1), whereby the pivoting of the 

first pivoted lever (11) from the first position into the second position and vice 
versa is carried out at the loading position of the cassette receiving device (10), 

that the cassette (1) is locked in the cassette receiving device (10) during its 
loading or unloading process by the positioning pins (111a; 111b) engaging with 

its catch apertures (6e; 6f), and that upon reaching the operating position, the 
lower ends of the positioning pins (111a; 111b) each engage with correspondingly 

arranged centring apertures (7a; 7b) in the drive chassis (7). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
  
 

the swivelling of the first pivoted lever (11) from the first position to the second 
position and vice versa is effected through the guiding of each of two pegs (113e; 

113g) mounted on the pivoted lever (11) in a control groove of two guiding 
elements (82a; 82b) which are disposed in a fixed position to the left and right 

on a vertical wall (81a; 81b) of the guide frame (8). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
in addition protection for the cassette receiving device (10) and the cassette (1) 

in the case of an incorrectly inserted cassette 1 is guaranteed by the shape of the 
control groove of the guiding elements (82a; 82b) and by the first pivoted lever 

(11). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
control disks (30a; 30b), each having a first (301a; 301b) and second (302a; 

302b) drive spigot, are provided to the left and right of the loading arrangement, 
and that the control disks (30a; 30b) can be driven in synchronism whereby the 

cassette receiving device (10) can be driven with the first (301a; 301b) and 
second (302; 302b)drive spigots, essentially engaging successively in 

corresponding guides of the cassette receiving device (10), and whereby the 
horizontal and the vertical movement of the cassette receiving device (10) 

between the loading and the operating position can be controlled with the aid of 
further pegs (201a; 135a; 201b; 135b) and further guides. 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 
a first helical guide groove (32a, 32b) is disposed on each control disk (30a; 30b) 

on the side facing away from the cassette receiving device (10), and said groove 
engages with the peg (201a; 201b) mounted on a vertically movable lifting 

mechanism (20a; 20b) of the loading arrangement, and that a second helical 
guide groove (31a; 31b) is disposed on each control disk (30a; 30b) on the side 

facing the cassette receiving device (10), and said groove is provided for  
 

engaging with the peg (135a; 135b) disposed on the cassette receiving device 
(10). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 
a pretensioned leaf spring is provided as vertical guiding element for the cassette 

(1) on the left and on the right side of the cassette receiving device (10), that in 
the loading position of the cassette receiving device (10) the vertical guiding 

elements have a slight play in relation to the upper housing wall (2a) of the 
cassette (1), that the vertical guiding elements form an end support for the 

cassette (1) if its tape protection flap (3) together with a second pivoted lever (12) 
is swung upwards by the insertion and ejection force from the cassette (1) to the 

cassette receiving device (10) or vice versa respectively, and that in the operating 
position, the vertical guiding elements are engaged with the upper housing wall 

(2a) of the cassette (1). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to one of the claims 4 through 6, 

characterized in that
 a third helical guide groove (34) is disposed on the side 
of the right-hand control disk (30a) facing away from the cassette receiving 

device (10), and said groove is provided for controlling a cassette drawer flap 
(212) as well as for controlling a sliding blind (210) which is mounted on the 

right-hand wall (81a) such that it can be moved horizontally and with which, in 
the loading position of the cassette receiving device (10), a tape-end sensor 

serving for the monitoring of the tape drive can be shaded, and that through the 
shading of this tape-end sensor in the loading position of the cassette receiving 

device (10), the motor drive for the cassette receiving device (10) can be 
activated for the loading procedure. 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 
a peg (215) mounted on the sliding blind (210) and provided for engaging with 

the third guide groove (34) is permanently engaged with the right-hand control  
 

disk (30a) through the action of an energy accumulator (216). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized in 
that
 the sliding blind (210) is coupled to a right-hand swivelling lever (211) such 
that it can rotate, whereby said lever forms, together with a corresponding lefthand 

lever, a stop for the cassette drawer flap (212) upon closing the cassette 
drawer. 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 
in an unloading procedure, prior to reaching the loading position of the cassette 

receiving device (10), the lever (211) and the corresponding left-hand lever 
engage with the pegs (135a, 135b) of the cassette receiving device (10). 
Cassette loading arrangement according to claim 9 or 10,
