<ABSTRACT>
A heater control for controlling operation of a heater switch (12) in an evaporative cooler having an alternative heater mode in which a heater element (40) is energised and part of the air flow is blanketed by a shutter (37) controlled by a slide (24) or other operator. The slide (24) has a cam face (25) which directly or indirectly compresses a spring (22) as the shutter (41) is closed, the spring (22) otherwise biasing the heater switch (12) to its open contact state, but when the spring (22) is compressed, the switch (12) reverts to its closed contact state to energise the heater element (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control means for controlling a heater when
incorporated in an evaporative type air conditioner.It is known to have reverse cycle air conditioners, but they require the
use of compressors and complex heat exchanger arrangements which are not
necessary in the much less expensive evaporative coolers. However, the
absence of compressors makes the heating of an occupied space more difficult
to achieve, other than with a direct heating means such as an element or a
ceramic heater.One of the problems which is encountered however, is that for cooling
purposes it is desirable that an air conditioner should discharge large volumes
of air, particularly when the cooling effect is achieved by evaporation of water.
Without large volumes of air humidity rises too much, and some of the
effectiveness of heat transfer to the human body is lost because of reduced
velocity. Reference can be made to our co-pending Application No PL 7801.The specification thereof describes means to combat the above difficulty
by reducing the size of the outlet opening from the motor and fan assembly of
an evaporative cooler, the reduced size being applicable only when the
conditioner is in a heating mode. This is described in said Application No PL
7801. One method of reducing the effective size is to cause vanes of a shutter
to move from an open position where they are spaced apart to a closed
position where they either abut or overlap. Another method is to hinge or slide
a blanketing membrane across the inner surface of the vanes if they are of the
fixed type. In each case, however, it is necessary to effect the movement
manually, and it is also most desirable (although not always essential in the
case of ceramic heaters) to have the switching arrangement interlocked with
the blanketing arrangement so that the heater can only be switched on when
the vanes inhibit the usual full flow of air from the device, and at all times when
the usual full flow of air is discharged from the device, the heater is switched
off.Heretofore attempts which have been made have not been as simple
and inexpensive as desired, and an object of this invention is to provide a very
simple arrangement wherein the control means for controlling of the outlet of a
cooler also actuates a switch which is normally biased to its OFF position.Various types of automatic switching are already known, for example the
pendulum type tilt switch. However, if a micro switch is used, it may be 
damaged, when used in an evaporative cooler by its ancillary

<CLAIMS>
A heater control for controlling operation of a heater switch (12)
in an evaporative cooler (11) having shutter means (41) movable between an open free

air flow position useable in a cooler mode and a closed part airflow position
useable in a heater mode, comprising


an operator (24) carried by a structure of said cooler coupled to said shutter
means (41) and movable to control said shutter means between its said positions,
a said heater switch (12) being carried by said structure and having an
extending actuating finger (15),
spring means (22) biasing said switch actuating finger (15) towards an open
contact state,
and a cam face (25) on said operator (24) co-acting with said spring means (22) to
compress said spring means and thereby cause said switch to revert to its

closed contact state, upon movement of said operator to close said shutter
means.
A heater control according to claim 1 wherein said operator
is a manually operated elongate slide (24) coupled at one end to said shutter means (41)

and having said cam surface at an opposite end.
A heater control according to claim 1 further comprising a
spring arm (19), hinge means (20) coupling one end of said spring arm (19) to said cooler

structure, and pusher means (18) on said spring arm aligned with said switch
actuating finger (15), said spring bearing against said spring arm and against said

cooler structure to effect said biasing of the switch actuating finger.
A heater control according to claim 3 further comprising
freely movable abutment means (16) between said pusher means (18) and said switch

actuating finger (15), and surfaces (17) on said cooler structure which both guide said
abutment means for movement and limit extent of said movement.
A heater control according to claim 3 wherein said pusher
means (18) comprises a plunger (18) on an end of said spring arm (15) and a freely movable

abutment ball (16) between the plunger and said switch actuating finger, and
surfaces (17) on said cooler structure which both guide the ball for movement and

limit extent of said movement.
A heater control according to claim 1, wherein said operator
is a manually operated elongate slide (24), and said shutter (41) comprises a finger set

having radiating fingers rotatable between an open free air flow position and a
closed position obstructing air flow from a fan of said cooler, surfaces defining

a slot in one of said fingers, 

said slide having a projection at one end engaging said slot, and its said
cam face at the other end, the cam face effecting said compression of spring

means as the shutter closure nears completion.
