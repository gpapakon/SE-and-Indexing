<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Hg-based
1223-type oxide superconductor which exhibits superconductive
properties at a temperature higher than liquid
nitrogen temperature, and a method of manufacturing the
oxide superconductor.Superconductors have unique properties, in which
the electric resistance is rendered zero at a critical
temperature (to be abbreviated as Tc, hereinafter), the
diamagnetism and Josephson effect are exhibited. The
superconductors are expected to be applied in a wide
range of technological field including power cables
without current loss, superconducting generator, high
field magnets for nuclear fusion plasma confinement,
materials for magnetic levitation vehicle, magnetic
sealed materials, and high-speed computers.It is reported that the superconducting properties
have been confirmed in about 30 types of copper oxides
after the discovery of the La-Ba-Cu-O-based superconductor
having Tc of about 30K in 1986 by Bednorz and
Muller. In particular, the Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based superconductor
has a Tc of 125K, and much attention is paid
thereto as a material having the highest Tc ever.
Recently, it has been reported that the Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based
superconductor (1223 type) exhibits a Tc of 133.5K
(A. Schiling et al., Nature (London) 363.56 (1993).The Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based superconductor is prepared 
in the following method. First, the precursor e.g.,
Ba2Ca2Cu3O7, BaCuO2, Ca2CuO3 or other oxides is
prepared, and HgO is mixed thereinto. The mixture is
further subjected to a thermal treatment at a
temperature of 800-850°C, for 10 hours, thus obtaining
the superconductor.However, the Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based superconductor
entails problems, i.e. it contains mercury which is
poisonous, it requires much time in its production since
HgO must be mixed with the precursor, and it has a low
reproducibility. Further, the crystal structure of the
Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based superconductor has a large
anisotropy, and therefore it is expected that the superconductive
properties including the critical current
density in a magnetic field, are very low.The present invention has been proposed under the
above-described circumstances, and the object thereof is
to provide a new oxide superconductor which is innoxious
and exhibits excellent superconducting properties, and a
method of manufacturing such an oxide superconductor at
a high efficiency and a high reproducibility.The present invention proposes an oxide superconductor
represented by (Hg1-xPbx)Ba2Ca2Cu3Oδ
(0.08 ≦ x ≦ 0.41, 7.625 ≦ δ ≦ 9.15), and having
