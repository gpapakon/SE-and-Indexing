<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a copper alloy piping for
supplying cold and hot water which piping has an excellent pitting
corrosion resistance.Pipings of copper obtained by deoxidizing the molten electrolytic
copper with phosphorus have been widely used as pitting
corrosion resistant pipings for supplying cold and hot water in
hotels, hospitals and apartment houses. This is because the
pipings of copper deoxidized with phosphorus are excellent in
corrosion resistance, workability, operability, etc. and thus
are used very suitably as pitting corrosion resistant pipings
for supplying cold and hot water.However, even when the pipings of copper deoxidized with
phosphorus are used, leakage accidents have occurred, though
rarely, due to the pitting corrosion, causing a problem. Pitting
corrosion is roughly divided into two types: Type I and
Type II. The pitting corrosion of Type I is caused by cold hard
water mainly in Europe. In Japan, pitting corrosion of Type II
occurs due to the hot soft water. Pitting corrosion of Type II occurs as follows. When the
anion ratio in water [SO42-]/[HCO3-] is greater than 1 and the
residual chlorine concentration is high, ClO2- concentrates below
a Cu2O layer formed on the inner surface of the copper alloy
piping and acts as a strong oxidizing agent. The ClO2- is
reduced to bring about a cathodic reaction and oxidizes Cu to
form CuO. Simultaneously, the ClO2- produces the corrosive anion
Cl-, which serves as a starting point of pitting corrosion. The
Cl- concentrates over the time. The H+ concentrates as Cl-
concentrates, thereby causing the reduction in pH. In this way,
the pitting corrosion of Type II progresses.There have been proposed a variety of copper alloy pipings
resistant to pitting corrosion of Type II. For example,
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 62-34821 discloses a
pitting corrosion resistant copper alloy piping for supplying
cold and hot water, the copper alloy containing 0.01 to 1 weight
% of Al, 0.03 to 2.5 weight % of Sn [where (Al+Sn) â‰¥ 0.1 weight
%], 0.005 to 0.5 weight % of one or more of P, Mg, B, Mn, and
Si, not more than 100 ppm of O, remainder Cu and unavoidable
impurities.However, the Cu-Al-Sn copper alloy piping disclosed in the
above publication has the problem of poor brazing ability,
weldability and workability because of its content of Al. 
Further, due to the recent increase of SO42- resulting from the
acid rain, increase of the residual chlorine concentration
resulting from the strengthening of the chlorine sterilization
caused
