<ABSTRACT>
Solvent systems for use in increasing the solubility of 3,3',5',5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and for making a permanent 
color record of the results of ELISAs using HRP have been developed. In the improved solvent system containing povidone, 

1-ethenyl-2-pyrrolidinone polymers, TMB can be dissolved in a very small quantity of solvent, up to a concentration of 100 to 200 
mM, which can then be mixed directly into an aqueous buffer without precipating the TMB. In the solvent system for making a 

permanent record, alginic acid (AA), methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymer (MVE/MAC), dextran sulfate (DS) and/or 
carrageenan are added to the aqueous buffer solution, with or without povidone, to form a colored precipate with the reaction 

product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is generally in the area of ELISAs, and in particular 
relates to improved chromogenic solutions. The Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay, or ELISA, is a 
well accepted and widely utilized method used in both qualitative and 
quantitative assays for biomolecules. In one embodiment of this assay, 
an enzyme is linked to an antibody against the molecule to be 
measured, and then used in combination with a chromogenic substrate 
for that enzyme which yields a colored reaction product. The 
molecule to be measured is immobilized on a solid phase such as a 
test tube or filter membrane. For example, as described in J. 
Immunoassay 2(3&4), 187-204 (1981), HorseRadish peroxidase (HRP) 
is chemically coupled to an antibody and the conjugate incubated with 
a solution containing a chromogenic substrate such as urea peroxide, a 
chromogen that changes color when urea peroxide is oxidized, and an 
appropriate buffer such as 0.03 M citrate-acetate or 0.1 M citrate-phosphate, 
pH 5.0. The formation of colored product can be 
qualitatively observed or quantitatively measured by absorption 
spectrophotometry. The rate and extent of color formation is 
proportional to the concentration of antigen. There are numerous 
other variations of this assay, using different enzymes and 
chromogenic substrates. The most sensitive chromogen as of this time for use with 
HRP is 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), as first reported by E.S. 
Bos, et al., in J. Immunoassay 2(3&4), 187-204 (1981). Unlike other 
benzidine compounds, this derivative is not mutagenic as determined 
using the Ames test. TMB, which is relatively insoluble in aqueous 
solutions, works best when first dissolved in a water-miscible solvent 
such as dioxane, dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMSO), rather than in solvents such as the lower alcohols, 
diethylether and aromatic solvents. For example, as described by Bos, 
et al., (1981), TMB is dissolved in DMSO up to 42 mM, and diluted 
into 0.1 M sodium acetate-citric acid buffer, pH 6.0. This is mixed 
with 1.3 mmole hydrogen peroxide or 0.5 mmole urea hydrogen  
 
peroxide immediately before addition of the conjugate, which reacts to 
turn the solution blue. Addition of acid stops the reaction and 
converts the blue color to a yellow color that can be measured at 450 
nm using a standard spectrophotometer. Both the untreated blue 
solution and the acidified yellow solution fade over time, leaving only 
the recorded absorbance as a permanent record. It is important to reduce background
