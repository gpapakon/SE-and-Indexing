<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc (1) reproducing apparatus including an optical head (3), memory 
(13), controller (11) and decoder (14). The head (3) intermittently reads digital data in 

at least two channels L, and R recorded on an optical disc. The memory (13) 
temporarily stores digital data obtained by demodulating the output data of the optical 

head (3). The controller (11) controls the reading operation of the optical head on the 
optical disc (1) based on the amount of the digital data stored in the memory (13). The 

controller (11) also controls an operation of writing data into the memory and an 
operation of reading data from the memory so that the digital data output by the optical 

head (3) are written into the memory (13) at a transfer rate which is higher than the 
transfer rate at which the digital signals stored in the memory are read out. The is 

supplied with the digital data for the two channels stored in the memory on a time-division 
basis. When data are supplied from the memory (13) to the decoder (14), the 

controller supplies the decoder with a channel identification signal for identifying the 
channel w
ith which the data received by the decoder is associated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording media reproducing
apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a
reproducing apparatus for recording media on which digital data in
a plurality of channels are recorded.CD (compact disc) players are known as reproducing apparatus
capable of reproducing music data and the like from an optical
disc. There have been also proposed reproducing apparatuses
utilizing a data-rewritable magneto-optical disc on which a user
can record music data and the like.In some reproducing apparatuses utilizing such disc media, the
vibration-resisting function has been improved by the use of a
buffer memory.Specifically, during reproduction by such a reproducing
apparatus, audio data read out from a disc are intermittently
written in a buffer memory at a high transfer rate and are
continuously read out from the buffer memory at a low transfer rate
to be demodulated as audio reproduction signals. At this time, the 
buffer memory always keeps some data accumulated therein.
Therefore, even if an external vibration or the like causes a track
jump leading to a temporary interruption in the data readout from
the disc, data can be continuously read out from the buffer memory.
This allows the reproduction sounds from the reproducing apparatus
to be output without interruption.An example of a recording format used in such a reproducing
apparatus will now be described with reference to the drawings.As shown in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, a recording track on a
magneto-optical disc has continuous clusters CL (=36 sectors) each
including a subdata area having four sectors (one sector = 2352
bytes) and a main data area having 32 sectors (SC0 - SC30), one
cluster constituting the minimum unit for recording. Such a
cluster corresponds to two or three turns along the track. An
address is recorded for each sector.The subdata area consisting of four sectors is used for
subdata or as a linking area and the like while TOC data, audio
data and the like are recorded on the main data area consisting of
32 sectors.A music data area recorded in a sector is subdivided into
sound groups, and eleven sound groups constitute two sectors.Specifically, the even sectors in FIG. 1B (SC0, SC2, SC4,
etc.) are configured as shown in FIG. 1C while the odd sectors in
FIG. 1B (SC1, SC3, SC5, etc.) are configured as shown in FIG.1D.As shown in FIGS. 1C and 1D, each sector has a header in which
a synchronization pattern SYNC and an address AD are recorded at 
the beginning thereof followed by a subheader, and
