<DESCRIPTION>
 STILBENE DERIVATIVES AS ANTICANCER AGENTSThe present invention relates to the use of stilbene derivatives and stilbene-like derivatives as anti-cancer agents, pharmaceutical compositions of these compounds and to novel compounds thereof. Tropical and subtropical shrubs and trees of the Combretacae family represent a potentially unexplored source of new compounds which have useful biological properties. For example, the genus Combretrum is known in the medical practices of Africa and India for treating various illness such as leprosy and cancer. However, only a few species like Combretrum micranthum and Combretrum zeyheri have received any substantial scientific work.In recent years through the work of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the African tree Combretrum caffrum has been found to contain certain agents which were determined to be highly cytotoxic. These agents isolated from the African tree Combretrum caffrum are referred to as combretasatins.U.S. Patent No. 4,996,237 to Pettit et al. relates to the isolation and syntheses of a neoplastic substance having the structural formula:
 The natural product having such a formula has» been referred to as "Combretasatin A-4". It has been observed that this cis-stilbene exhibits strong cytotoxic activity by inhibiting tubulin polymerization.European Patent Application No. 276,051 to Pettit et al. relates to the isolation, structural elucidation and synthesis of new antineoplastic compounds having the structural formulas:wherein Rχ is OH or OCH3; R2 is H or 0CH3; or Rχ and R2 taken together is -0CH20-; R3 is H or OH; and R4 is OH or 0CH3 and wherein the configuration of the double bond in formula (A) is cis. These compounds were tested to determine their murine 388 lymphocytic leukemia inhibitation. 

 Despite their potential use as anti-cancer agents, these combretasatin derivatives are limited by their relatively low solubility in water and saline. This has led to an increased interest in the syntheses and evaluation of polymethoxylated stilbenes and dihydrostilbenes as potential anti-cancer agents.Thus, the present invention is directed to the development of new anti-cancer agents based on these natural products as structural leads. More specifically, the present invention is directed to compounds having two aryl or heteroaryl groups or combinations thereof separated by a bridging unit of at least 1 or 2 atoms, such as C=0, alkylene, alkyleneamino, carboxamido (or derivatives thereof), or alkene (e.g., ethenes), in which the aryl or heteroaryl groups
