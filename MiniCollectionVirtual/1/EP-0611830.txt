<ABSTRACT>
The maximum useful rate of aluminum refining is 
increased by baffle means positioned across the 

refining chamber under the rotor of a spinning nozzle 
in the refining chamber, with open spaces to facilitate 

cleaning being provided in the vicinity of the side 
wall of the refining chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the refining of molten
aluminum. More particularly, it relates to the
dispersion of a gas in the molten aluminum.Molten aluminum, as derived from most common
sources, such as primary metal, scrap and re-melt
ingot, usually must be purified before being cast into
ingots, sheets or bars. This may be done by bubbling
an inert gas, i.e., nitrogen or argon, through the
aluminum in molten form. In some embodiments, a
halogen gas, usually chlorine, is added, or the halogen
gas may be used alone for such purification purposes.
This type of treatment can remove dissolved hydrogen,
alkali metals such as sodium and lithium, and small
solid particles such as aluminum oxide. The
effectiveness of a given volume of gas in such
treatment is increased by reducing the bubble size of
the gas in the molten aluminum, thereby increasing the 
total gas-metal surface area. The effectiveness of the
gas bubbles is also increased by the dispersing of said
gas bubbles throughout the body of molten aluminum to
be treated. One very effective way of both making
small bubbles and dispersing them is by the use of a
spinning nozzle positioned in the body of molten
aluminum. Commercial systems are available for this
purpose, including the SNIF™ systems of Union Carbide
Industrial Gases Inc. for in-line refining of metals
flowing from a holder to a casting station. The Pelton
patent, U.S. 4,784,374, discloses and illustrates a
particular embodiment of said SNIF™ system.The refining rate of such a spinning nozzle system
can be increased by increasing the process gas flow
rate employed therein. It is usually also necessary to
increase the nozzle rotating speed to continue the
desired making of small bubbles and the dispersing of
said small bubbles throughout the molten aluminum in
the refining zone of the system. Such increase in gas
flow and nozzle rotating speed are usually accompanied
by increased turbulence on the surface of the molten
aluminum. The maximum refining rate of a given
refining system, however, is limited by the maximum
surface turbulence or roughness that can be tolerated
therein.Excessive surface turbulence is undesirable in a
refining system for several reasons. Thus, the
increased metal surface area that is produced thereby
leads to higher reaction rates with any reactive gas
that might be present. For example, oxygen from air
will react to form aluminum oxide films, and water
vapor from the air will react to form hydrogen in the
metal and oxide films. Furthermore, when solid
particles are
