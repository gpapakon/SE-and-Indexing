<ABSTRACT>
The release agent compositions of the present 
invention comprise mixtures of amino-functional and 

amine-free polydimethylsiloxanes wherein the viscosity, 
amine equivalent and content of dimethylsiloxane 

oligomers containing up to 20 silicon atoms are within 
specified limits. The compositions do not evolve oily 

volatiles or silicon dioxide powder even during 
exposure to elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a release agent 
comprising organosilicon compounds which are based on 
an amino-functional diorganopolysiloxane. The various utilities of amino-functional 
diorganopolysiloxanes are disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Publication [Kokai] Sho 53-3992 [3,992/1978]; Sho 60-229719 
[229,719/1985]; Hei 3-275710 [275,710/1991]; and 
Hei 4-230784 [230,784/1992]). The amino-functional diorganopolysiloxanes 
described in these publications contain large 
quantities, typically from 50,000 to 200,000 ppm, of 
dimethylpolysiloxane oligomers with up to 20 silicon 
atoms. During long-term use at elevated temperatures, 
these oligomers evaporate and stick to machinery such 
as exhaust fans and cause the formation of oily stains. 
In addition, this oil can drip on and stain moldings. Another very serious problem is that 
diorganopolysiloxane oligomers may undergo oxidation, 
producing a silicon dioxide powder, that can adversely 
affect surrounding electrical/electronic components. 
For xerographic copiers, the silicon dioxide powder 
produced by such oxidation sticks to the corotron, 
thereby preventing production of clear, crisp copies. In industrial processes using solvent-based 
paints, a binder resin is cured while evaporating 
solvent by heating and the gaseous by-products are 
completely combusted using a platinum catalyst. 
However, when an amino-containing diorganopolysiloxane 
is present in the solvent-based paint, the silicon 
dioxide powder coats the surface of the platinum 
catalyst honeycomb, thereby impairing the efficacy of 
the catalyst. As the result of extensive research directed 
at solving the aforementioned problems associated with  
 
prior art amino-functional diorganopolysiloxanes, the 
present inventors have found a solution by using 
mixtures of amino-functional diorganopolysiloxanes and 
amine-free diorganopolysiloxanes which exhibit 
specified limits on amine equivalent weight, viscosity, 
and concentration of the mixed oligomers containing up 
to 20 silicon atoms, represented in this specification 
by the expression Si≤20. Amino-functional diorganopolysiloxanes have 
heretofore generally been prepared by the equilibration 
polymerisation of a mixture of at least one cyclic 
diorganopolysiloxane oligomer and at least one cyclic 
amino-containing diorganopolysiloxane oligomer in the 
presence of alkali catalyst, followed by removal of the 
low boiling point materials in the reaction product by 
heating under reduced pressure. A disadvantage of this 
method is that the
