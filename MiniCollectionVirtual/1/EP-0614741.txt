<ABSTRACT>
An method of making an elongated component (34) for a 
tampon applicator includes the use of an injection mold (10) 

having an elongated mold cavity that corresponds to the 
desired shape of the component. The injection mold has a 

melt flow channel (26) defined therein which extends in the 
elongated direction and has a thickness which is greater than 

the thickness of the adjacent portion of the mold cavity. 
The method further includes the steps of injecting a 

solidifiable liquid material into the elongated mold cavity 
and removing the formed component from the injection mold 

once the material has solidified. The melt flow channel (26) 
enables the component to be formed with thinner walls, and 

with more viscous liquid material than was heretofore 
possible. The invention also embraces the mold assembly and 

the component itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making an 
elongated component for a catamenial tampon applicator in 
accordance with claim 1 and to an injection mold assembly for making 
an elongated component in accordance with claim 6.  
 
Such a thin walled plastic product is designed to be 
quickly biodegradable. A method and an injection mold assembly according to 
the preamble of claims 1 and 6 is known from US-A-4 361 150. 
This document discloses a method of making an elongated 
component for a tampon applicator, wherein said component has 
a thin cylindrical wall which is provided with an annular ring 
at one end and with petals at the forward dome-shaped end of 
the component comprising: providing a mold assembly having an 
elongated mold insert which is insertable between first and 
second mold halves so as to define an elongated mold cavity 
that corresponds to the shape of the applicator component; 
said injection mold assembly having a melt flow channel 
defined therein; the melt flow channel extends in the 
enlongated direction; the thickness of said melt flow channel 
is greater than the thickness of the adjacent portion of the 
mold cavity; injecting a solidifiable liquid material into the 
elongated mold cavity and removing the formed component from 
the injection mold once the material has solidified. FR-A-1 305 166 discloses a method of making tubes by 
injection molding in only one step to reduce at the same time 
the wall thickness and to realize an economical use of the 
material. As to solve this problem, this document proposes 
longitudinal bridges within the outer surface within the 
elongated mold insert to provide longitudinal grooves in the 
outer surface of the tube. During injection, the material 
flows to the basis of the tube and forms longitudinal ribs at 
the outer surface of the tube. These grooves are used as a 
multiplicity of injection channels.  
 EP-A-0 291 024 is related to tampon applicators and 
compositions for making same. This document discloses a 
biodegradable tampon applicator comprising a molded, flexible 
polymeric hollow cylindrical body for enclosing a tampon 
therein and having a first open end through which the tampon 
is expelled and a second open end for receiving a plunger to 
expell said tampon, wherein said body comprising a moldable 
poly 3-hydroxybutyric acid composition. US-A-3 954 104 discloses a thermoplastic water-dispersible, 
biodegradable composition which is resistant to 
fungal attack prior to dispersal and containers made 
therefrom. The
