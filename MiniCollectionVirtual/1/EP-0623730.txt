<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an extruded elastic seal for windows, doors or the like, which exhibits an upper sealing head (1), which, in the event of a sealing action, forms a sealing region between two surfaces which are to be sealed, and further exhibits a lower sealing foot (2) which exhibits a foot web (4), running from the sealing head (1), and, in order to secure the extruded seal in a receiving groove of a sash/leaf rebate or frame rebate of a window, door or the like, a profile formation connected to the foot web (4) and comprising, at least on one side of the foot web (4), an elastically bendable footlip (5), which projects obliquely upwards from said foot web, and a further, elastically deformable securing device (6). In the case of said extruded elastic seal, said securing device is designed such that, upon introduction of the sealing foot (2) into the receiving groove, it catches into operative engagement with said groove only if the footlip (5) is bent by a predetermined measure (a) in the direction of the foot web (4).

Flexible cord seal for windows, doors or the like with an 
upper sealing head (1) which during sealing engagement forms a 

sealing area between two surfaces to be sealed and with a 
lower sealing foot (2), which is provided with a foot piece 

(4) running from the sealing head (1) and with a profile 
formation connected to the foot piece (4) for holding the cord 

seal in a housing slot (15) of a leaf or frame recess of a 
window, a door or the like, which, when seen in the cross 

section of the cord seal includes at least on one side of the 
foot piece (4) an elastically deformable foot lip (5) which 

stands away from this obliquely in the upward direction as 
well as a further elastically deformable holding device which 

when the sealing foot (2) is inserted in the housing slot (15) 
only comes into a hook-type effective engagement with the 

housing slot (15) when the foot lip (5) is bent in in the 
direction of the foot piece (4), characterized in that the 

further holding device is constructed in the form of an 
elastically deformable protrusion (6) which is provided at the 

side of the foot lip (5) which is turned away from the foot 
piece (4) at a distance (a) from its free end (16). 
Flexible cord seal according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the protrusion (6) is constructed with a saw-tooth 

formation in cross section.  
 
Flexible cord seal according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that further protrusions (7, 8) are provided 

at the foot lip (5) next to the protrusion (6) at the side of 
the protrusion (6) turned away from the free end of the foot 

lip (5). 
Flexible cord seal according to claim 3 on which additional 
foot lips (9;16) are provided at the foot piece (4), 

characterized in that elastically deformable protrusions 
(10-14;17) are also formed on these additional foot lips 

(9;16) on their sides turned away from the foot piece (4). 
Flexible cord seal according to claim 4, characterized in 
that all foot lips (5,9,16) are arranged over each other 

according to their lengths in such a way that the longest foot 
lip (5) is located in the upper position and the shortest foot 

lip (16) is located in the lower position.
