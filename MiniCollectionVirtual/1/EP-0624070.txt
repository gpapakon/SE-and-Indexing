<ABSTRACT>
The device for relieving the skeletal muscles, especially for the neck and lumbar vertebrae, comprises a mat of foam material with transverse ribs projecting on the upper side and standing obliquely towards the foot side and a foam pillow with transverse ribs projecting on the upper side and standing obliquely towards the head side. The divergently oblique transverse ribs of both foam sections stretch the spine in two opposite directions and increase the space between the vertebrae to release and sooth pinched nerve-ends and overstressed discs.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for relaxing the skeletal muscle system in particular of the neck 
vertebrae, comprising foam material moulded bodies having transverse ribs, 

characterised by, 

a homogeneous foam material moulded body (10) for the head and shoulder 
region, 
comprising a bottom panel (1) which is at least finger thick, 
a plurality of transverse ribs 2, 2' divergently inclined, projecting from the 
bottom panel (1) to a level approximately equal to the width of a hand 
 
and 


one or two bent over continuations (3, 4) of the bottom panels, covering the 
upmost side of the transverse ribs (2, 2'), 
the foam material moulded body (10 respectively 10 and 1') being supported 
on a mattress (15) of at least body length having on its upper side 

divergently inclined transverse ribs (16, 16'). 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the bottom panel (1) is supported on a support panel (1') of 

dual size and made of the same homogeneous foam material. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the mattress (15) by way of a raised transverse rib (14) engages 

into a downwardly directed transverse groove (13) of the foam material moulded 
material (10). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 3,
 
characterised in that the thickness of the mattress (15) diminishes towards the foot 

end.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the foam material moulded body (10) and the mattress (15) are 

composed of latex foam material. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised by 


a homogeneous foam material moulded body (101) for the head and 
shoulder region, 
comprising a cover panel (21) of at least finger thickness, and 
a plurality of transverse ribs (2, 2') projecting downwardly from the cover 
panel (21) to a level corresponding approximately to the width of a hand, 

optionally standing divergently inclined. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised by 


a homogeneous foam material moulded body (102) for the head and 
shoulder region comprising a bottom panel (1) of at least finger thickness 

and a cover panel (21) of at least finger thickness, and 
a plurality of transverse ribs (2, 2') there between optionally divergently 
inclined. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised by 


a mattress having at least body length, 
covered by a cover panel. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the foam material moulded body (10; 101; 102; 103) and/or the mattress (15) of 

body length, instead of a bottom panel respectively covering panel, comprises a 
central panel. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the foam material moulded body (10; 101; 102; 103) and the mattress (15) of body 

length are made in one piece.
