<ABSTRACT>
A pressure operated switch device in which switch operation is effected by movement of the diaphragm in response to a fluid pressure difference across it, permanent magnets (40, 41) hold the diagphragm assembly (10) against switch operating movement until a reset device (45) is operated to release the diaphragm assembly from the magnets. A further permanent magnet (32) assists snap action and movement of the diaphragm assembly against the plungers of microswitches (20, 21), mounted on a bracket (25) which limits diaphragm movement against the plungers. A return spring (36) biasses the diaphragm assembly against the permanent magnets (40, 41).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pressure switch device, that is, a switch device which is 
operable in response to a predetermined pressure difference. Such pressure switch devices conventionally comprise a diaphragm separating two 
chambers communicating with respective fluid pressures. Movement of the diaphragm in 
response to a predetermined difference between the two pressures effects switch operation. 
Typically such pressure switch devices function to open one or more switches when a 
pressure falls below a predetermined level, as a safety measure. GB-A-908,916 and EP-A-0,003,188 each disclose pressure switch devices which 
respectively include magnet hold-on and hold-off means for the movable diaphragm 
thereof. The present invention is concerned with a pressure switch device of this kind which 
affords improved operating facilities and characteristics. According to the present invention there is provided a pressure switch device 
comprising a diaphragm member movable in response to a pressure difference effective 
on its opposed sides to effect operation of a switch means, and comprising hold-on magnet 
means tending to retain the diaphragm member in a position of operative engagement with 
the switch means, characterised by hold-off magnet means selectively operable to hold the 
diaphragm member against movement in response to the pressure difference, and wherein 
first and second plates of magnetic material are secured to respective sides of the 
diaphragm member to cooperate with the hold-on and hold-off means respectively, the 
device further including a reset device operable to move the diaphragm member away from 
the hold-off magnet means. The invention thus provides a pressure switch device of the kind described 
including "hold-on" means acting to oppose diaphragm movement until a predetermined 
pressure condition is reached. Such "hold-on" means provide a "snap" action of the 
diaphragm, so that the pressure forces acting on the diaphragm at the time of switch 
operation can be lower than would be possible in the absence of the magnet means. The 
"hold-on" means is advantageously selectively adjustable, so as to permit adjustment of  
 
pressure difference at which the diaphragm moves. The "hold-on" means conveniently 
operates magnetically, and can thus be constituted by selectively movable magnet means, 
conveniently in the form of one or more permanent magnets engaged by the diaphragm 
when in its switch operating position. A return spring can be provided to assist return of 
the

<CLAIMS>
A pressure switch device comprising a diaphragm member (10) movable in 
response to a pressure difference effective on its opposed sides to effect operation of a 

switch means (20, 21), and comprising hold-on magnet means (32) tending to retain the 
diaphragm member (10) in a position of operative engagement with the switch means (20, 

21), characterised by hold-off magnet means (40, 41) selectively operable to hold the 
diaphragm member against movement in response to the pressure difference, and wherein 

first (17) and second (18) plates of magnetic material are secured to respective sides of the 
diaphragm member (10) to cooperate with the hold-on and hold-off means respectively, 

the device further including a reset device (45,46) operable to move the diaphragm member 
(10) away from the hold-off magnet means (40,41). 
A pressure switch device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the force applied by the 
hold-on magnet means (32) is selectively adjustable. 
A pressure switch device as claimed in Claim 2, having means (31, 35) for selective 
adjustment of the position of the hold-on magnet means (32) along the direction of 

movement of the diaphragm member (10). 
A pressure switch device as claimed in any one of Claims 1-3, wherein said reset 
device includes plunger means (46) operable to separate the diaphragm member (10) from 

the hold-off magnet means (40, 41). 
A pressure switch device as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the plunger means (46) 
is operable mechanically, pneumatically, hydraulically or electrically. 
A pressure switch device as claimed in any preceding claim and having stop means 
comprising a support (25) mounting the switch means (20, 21). 
A pressure switch device as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the support (25)  
 

comprises a limb (26) extending in the direction of movement of the diaphragm (10) and 
having the switch means (20,21) secured thereto, the free end of the limb (26) being 

engageable by the diaphragm member (10). 
A pressure switch device as claimed in any preceding claim, having return bias 
means (36) opposing movement of the diaphragm member (10) to the operative 

engagement position thereof.
