<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a stator of a 
stepping motor comprises the steps of carrying out 

a half-pierce and push-back process to a frame plate (10) 
to make an area in which comb teeth (16) are to be formed 

and an area to be blanked out readily separable, 
carrying out a blanking process to separate the 

blanked piece (20) from the comb teeth (16), bending the comb 
teeth to a predetermined angle and collapsing the 

comb teeth to make the thicknesses of the comb teeth 
uniform; and bending the comb teeth at right angle 

to an outer periphery of the frame piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a stator of a motor, and more 
particularly to a method of the kind defined by the precharacterizing features of claim 1 for manufacturing comb teeth 
of a stator of a small size stepping motor having an 
outer cylinder diameter of 10 to 100 mm. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a stepping motor 
generally comprises a rotor 1 and stators 31, 32 and 41, 42 
and the stators 31, 32 and 41, 42 have a plurality of 
pole teeth (comb teeth) 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b for mounting 
exciting coils 5a and 5b circumferentially formed 
thereon at a constant pitch. The comb teeth 3a, 3b, 
4a and 4b are preferably longer in order to attain a 
large effective magnetic flux created by the 
excitation of the excitation coils 5a and 5b. 
However, where the comb teeth are manufactured by 
simply blanking a center of a single frame plate as 
it is in the prior art, the length of the comb teeth 
less than one half of a blanking diameter and there 
is a limit in attaining a large effective magnetic 
flux. A method of the kind defined by the precharacterizing features of claim 1 for manufacturing a stator to solve 
the above problem has been proposed in Japanese  
 
Patent Publication No. 57-211964 (Patent Application 
No. 56-98007). In the proposed method for manufacturing the 
stator, as shown in a sectional view of Fig. 11A, a 
center area 14 of a single frame plate 10 is convex-formed, 
then as shown in a sectional view of Fig. 
11B, the center area 14 is blanked while leaving a 
comb teeth area 16, and finally as shown in sectional 
view of Fig. 11C, the comb teeth area 16 is bent 
normally to the frame plate by burring to manufacture 
the stator. In accordance with this proposed 
manufacturing method, the length of the comb teeth 
may be made larger than one half of the blanking 
diameter. Numeral 12 denotes an outer periphery of 
the frame plate, numeral 18 denotes a center hole 
formed by the blanking, and numeral 20 denotes a 
blanked piece. However, this prior art manufacturing method 
has the following problems: 
(1) The stator is usually manufactured by 
sequentially feeding the frame plate by transfer 
press. As shown in Fig. 12, in the blanking process, 
the frame plate 10 is supported by a die 30 from the 
bottom and it is blanked by a punch 32. Because of a 
strength of the die, it is not possible to blank the 
comb teeth of the stator in one step and it is 
usually done in two or three steps. Numeral 34  
 
denotes a stripper and TD denotes an interval of 
holes of
