<ABSTRACT>
A method to determine the presence or amount of peroxidase or hydrogen peroxide employing a sulfonephthalein dye or a phthalein dye having a major absorbance peak in the visible region, preferably at a wavelength from between about 500 nanometers to about 700 nanometers, and which absorbance peak is subject to a degree of oxidative extinguishment without strong alkali treatment, is disclosed. The method is performed by forming a reaction system comprising such sulfonephthalein dye or phthalein dye, and a test sample containing an unknown amount of (i) peroxide, (ii) a peroxidase, (iii) a compound which is capable of being oxidized to generate hydrogen peroxide, or (iv) a catalyst which participates in such oxidation, wherein the hydrogen peroxide causes peroxidase-catalyzed extinguishment of the absorbance peak of such dye whereby the unknown amount under determination can be determined by monitoring such extinguishment.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COLORIMETRIC DETERMINATION OF PEROXIDASE AND PEROXIDEField of the InventionThe present invention relates to the colorimetric determination of peroxidases and peroxide. In particular, the present invention relates to the colorimetric determination of peroxidases, peroxide, compounds which can be directly or indirectly oxidized to yield a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen peroxide, and catalysts which directly or indirectly oxidize compounds to yield a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen peroxide.Background of the InventionThe generation of hydrogen peroxide (HO ) when poly orphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages are subjected to certain membrane stimuli, ' and the reaction of H202 with phenol red in the presence of horseradish peroxidase to produce a reaction product which changes the color of the system from red to yellow, have been described [Pick, et al., Journal of Immunoloqical Methods, Vol. 38, pages 161- 170 (1980)]. The described yellow color of such system changes to purple-mauve when the pH is raised to 12.5 wherein the amount of H_,02 is determined by measuring the absorbance of the purple-mauve system at 610 nanometers against the absorbance of a buffered phenol red solution. Similarly, the determination of neutrophil-generated lipid peroxides by the oxidation of phenol red has also been 

 described [Moslen, et al., Journal of Immunoloqical Methods- Vol. 98, pages 71-76 (1987)], as well as the determination of the degree of oxidation of molten fats utilizing various oxidizable dyes in a very strongly alkaline medium (German Patent No. 2,630,052 and German Patent No. 2,543,543).However, such methods require treatment with strong alkali solutions of pH 10 or above, either during or after oxidation of the dyes employed therein, in order to achieve the desired change in color.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a method to determine the presence or amount of peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide (HO ), and substances which are capable of generating hydrogen peroxide, or catalyzing the generation of hydrogen peroxide. According to such method, a sulfonephthalein dye or a phthalein dye having a major absorbance peak in the visible region, preferably at a wavelength from between about 500 nanometers to about 700 nanometers, is subjected to oxidative extinguishment without strong alkali treatmen .The method is performed by forming a reaction system comprising such sulfonephthalein dye or phthalein dye and: (a) a test sample containing an unknown amount of peroxidase; and an amount of
