<ABSTRACT>
A drug delivery apparatus and method for delivering a drug locally to internal body tissue using a catheter device including a polymer matrix (12) containing a drug. The drug is actively transported from the polymer matrix (12) to the internal body tissue using iontophoresis or phonophoresis. In addition, the polymer matrix (12) can be expanded to promote intimate contact with the walls of a passageway or vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMER MATRIX DRUG DELIVERY APPARATUS AND METHODBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a drug delivery apparatus and method for selectively and locally delivering a drug to internal body tissue. More particularly, the present invention relates to a catheter device including a polymer matrix containing a drug and transport means for actively transporting the drug from the polymer matrix to the internal body tissue.2. Description of the Related Art Many techniques currently exist for delivering drugs or other medicaments to body tissue. These include, among possible others, oral administration, injection directly into body tissue such as through an intramuscular injection or the like, topical or transcutaneous administration where the drug is passively absorbed, or caused to pass, into or across the skin or other surface tissue and intravenous administration which involves introducing a selected drug directly into the blood stream. Except for topical or transcutaneous administration, the above drug delivery systems tend to be systemic. In other words, administration of the drug is delivered throughout the body by the blood stream. Although transcutaneous drug delivery systems tend to be localized delivery systems in that the drug is delivered locally to a selected area, such drug delivery systems are also, by definition, limited to application of a drug externally through the patient's skin or other surface tissue. Thus, the above described drug delivery systems are generally not appropriate for the localized treatment of internal body tissue.Because of the limitations of transcutaneous drug delivery systems along with the problems associated with systemic drug administration, the benefits of 

devices providing localized internal delivery of drugs have become more apparent. In particular, localized internal delivery devices avoid the high dosage levels associated with systemic delivery which can result in adverse side effects. Systemic delivery also fails to concentrate the therapeutic agents in the local area where they are most effective. In addition, by treating only the diseased tissue with a localized delivery device, the total quantity of drug used may be significantly reduced which also reduces the cost of therapy. Furthermore, localized drug delivery may also allow the use of therapeutic agents which, although very effective, have previously been considered too toxic or non-specific to administer systemically. One example is the ability to treat
