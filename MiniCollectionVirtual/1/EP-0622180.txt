<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to multilayered, bituminous waterproof sheeting, in particular for waterproofing bridges, roads or multistorey car park decks, characterised by   - an upper layer (1) comprising a bitumen welding composition, in particular an SBS- and/or APP-modified bitumen; - a support layer (3) which is simultaneously a waterproofing layer and comprises a bitumen-resistant, crosslinked rubber, in particular based on EPDM and/or butyl rubber, where the support layer is additionally provided with an inlay (7) of laid or woven glass fabric; - a base layer (5) comprising a bitumen welding composition, in particular an SBS modified bitumen; - two adhesion layers (2, 4) comprising a thermoplastic elastomer, in particular based on EPDM, SBS and bitumen, where the adhesive layers are arranged on both sides of the support layer (3) and are adjacent to the upper layer (1) or the base layer (5); and - a bottom layer (6) which comprises a film and is adjacent to the base layer (5).

<CLAIMS>
A multi-layer bituminous sealing-sheet, especially as a deck seal
for bridges, road or parking areas, comprising


one carrier-layer (3) which at the same time is a sealing-layer
and consists of a bitumen-resistant cross-linked rubber, on the

basis of EPDM and/or butyl rubber, the carrier-layer being
provided in addition with an inlay (7) of glass spawn or glass

tissue;

characterised by
one upper-layer (1) consisting of a bituminous welding
composition, on the basis of a SBS- and/or APP-modified bitumen,

in which the proportion of SBS and/or APP amounts to from 8 to 20%
by wt.;
one carrier-layer (3) in which the proportion of cross-linked
rubber amounts to from 20 to 40% by wt.;
one foundation-layer (5) consisting of a bituminous welding
composition on the basis of a SBS-modified bitumen, in which the

proportion of SBS amounts to from 8 to 20% by wt.;
two adhesive layers (2, 4) consisting of a thermoplastic elastomer
on the basis of a mixture of EPDM, SBS and bitumen, in which the

proportion of EPDM/SBS in the whole mixture amounts to from 20 to
80% by wt., and further the adhesive layers are arranged on

opposite sides of the carrier-layer (3) and adjoin the upper layer
(1) and foundation-layer respectively; as well as
an underlayer (6) consisting of a foil next to the
foundation-layer (5),
A sealing-sheet as Claim 1, characterised in that in the upper
layer (1) the proportion of SBS and/or APP amounts to from 10 to

15% by wt. 
A sealing-sheet as in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
minimum thickness of the upper layer (1) amounts to 1 mm.
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that in the carrier-layer (3) the proportion of cross-linked

rubber amounts to from 25 to 35% by wt.
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the carrier-layer (3) exhibits a minimum thickness of 1 mm.
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that in the event of the employment of the sealing-sheet for the

water-proofing of bridges the carrier layer (3) is arranged in
about the upper third (referred to the total thickness of the

sealing-sheet).
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that in the event of the employment of the sealing-sheet for the

water-proofing of structures in the non-bridge range the
carrier-layer (3) is arranged in about the middle (referred to the

total thickness of the sealing-sheet).
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the inlay (7) has a weight of from 50 to 100 g/m
2
,
especially from 60 to 70 g/m
2
.
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that in the foundation-layer (5) the proportion of SBS amounts to

from 10 to 15% by wt.
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterised in
that in the event of the employment of the sealing-sheet for the

water-proofing of bridges the minimum thickness of the
foundation-layer (5) amounts to 3 mm. 
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterised in
that in the event of the employment of the sealing-sheet for the

water-proofing of structures in the non-bridge range the minimum
thickness of the foundation-layer (5) amounts to 2 mm.
A sealing-sheet as in one of the Claims 1 to 11, characterised in
that the adhesive layers (2, 4) as regards the polymeride on the

basis of SBS/EPDM the following composition holds:

SBS
