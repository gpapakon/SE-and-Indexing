<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a railway basket car for transporting semitrailers 
according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1. It is known that railway basket cars provided with a so called pocket are applied for 
transporting semitrailers during a combined road-railway transport. For the time 
being, two kinds of railway basket cars provided with pocket are known. According to the first version, the pocket is a fixed part of the basket car and 
accordingly, the trailers should be lifted and placed into the pocket. The semitrailers 
and some types of the trailers, however, can not be lifted by a crane because the 
underframe sysmtem is not constructed for that purpose and is not capable to bear 
the weight of the semitrailer and the load together. Another kind of railway basket cars is provided with a pocket which may be rotated 
around a shaft. The pocket may be turned to the side of the basket car together with 
one of its longitudinal side beams. In this position, the trailer or semitrailer can be 
shifted directly into the pocket. The drawback of this railway basket car type is that both the pocket itself and the 
hydropneumatic operating system is a rather sophisticated construction which is not 
usual in the art and therefore, a qualified personnel is needed for the loading. 
Furthermore, the opening and closing operations are rather time consuming. A railway basket car for transporting truck-trailers is known 
from the DE-A-41 12 995, wherein a basket forms a stress-free 
unity with a reinforced longitudinal beam of the railway basket 
car in a transporting position and is to be lifted in a loading 
and unloading position by means of a lifting device arranged in 
front of an end-loading ramp to receive the whole truck-semitrailer-unity. 
The basket is locked both in the 
transporting position and loading and unloading position. The object of the present invention is to provide a railway basket car for transporting 
semitrailers which is of a rather simple construction, does not need special 
personnel for operating and which enables semitrailers to be loaded by lifting.  
 According to the invention, this is achieved by the features in 
the characterizing part of claim 1. Advantageous further 
embodiments are described in the subclaims. The pocket may be lifted from the basket car and a truck can push the semitrailer 
onto the pocket placed on the earth. Then the wheels are fixed against rotation and 
the semitrailer is switched off the truck. Thereafter the pocket and the semitrailer
