<ABSTRACT>
A tape loading device comprises: a plate cam which 
moves in a straight line at a constant speed; a rack 

provided on the plate cam; an arm load gear provided with a 
gearwheel which engages with the rack, and rotates as the 

plate cam executes linear motion; a lever mechanism which 
moves as the arm load gear rotates; a tape guide provided at 

the end of the lever mechanism, which withdraws the tape 
from the cassette starting from the unloaded position and 

finishing in the loaded position; and a guide member 
provided with a guide hole which guides the tape guide from 

the unloaded position to the loaded position, or in the 
reverse direction. The gearwheel on the arm load gear which 

engages with the rack comprises a first tooth having a pitch 
circle of radius referred to as a first radius, and a second 

tooth having a pitch circle of radius referred to as a 
second radius which is larger than the first radius; and 

when the tape is loaded, the rack of the plate cam engages 
with the first tooth of the arm load gear so as to move the 

tape guide from the unloaded position of the tape guide to a 
predetermined position before the loaded position of the 

tape guide, and the rack of the plate cam subsequently 
engages with the second tooth of the arm load gear so as to 

move the tape guide to its loaded position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape loading device 
which withdraws tape from a tape cassette inserted in a 
magnetic recording/playback apparatus and winds it on a 
rotating drum. A conventional tape loading device is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Kokai Publication S61-184761 (184761/1986). 
In this device, the speed of motion of the tape guides which 
withdraw tape from the tape cassette when the tape is 
loaded, is effectively constant. Consequently, when loading 
is complete, the tape guides suddenly stop moving so that 
some surplus tape is pulled out by inertial force, with the 
result that the tape is loaded with slack in the tape. Another conventional tape loading device is disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication S62-125563 
(125563/1987). In this device, the speed of motion of the 
tape guides which withdraw tape from the cassette when the 
tape is loaded, is varied by combining an eccentric gear and 
a rotating member which rotates the gear. The guide speed 
is gradually decreased during the loading operation, thereby 
preventing slack in the tape when loading is complete. The 
device however has a complex construction comprising the 
eccentric gear, rotating member and a cam mechanism which  
 
actuates the rotating member so that the cost of 
manufacturing the device is high. Further JP-A-58/322 65 discloses another tape loading device presenting all the features defined in the preamble of claim 1. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide, by means of a simple construction, a tape loading 
device which slows down the tape guides which withdraw tape 
at a predetermined position before tape loading is complete, 
thereby preventing the occurrence of slack in the tape when 
loading is complete. A tape loading device according to the invention withdraws tape from a cassette 
from an unloaded position in the cassette to a loaded 
position where it comes into contact with a rotating drum; 
said tape loading device comprises: a motor; an arm load gear provided with a gearwheel; a lever mechanism which moves as the arm load 
gear rotates; a tape guide provided at the end of the lever 
mechanism, which withdraws the tape from the cassette 
starting from the unloaded position and finishing in the 
loaded position; and a guide member provided with a guide 
hole which guides the tape guide from the unloaded position 
to the loaded position, or in the reverse direction; said tape loading device is characterised in that 
it further comprises: a plate cam 
which moves in a
