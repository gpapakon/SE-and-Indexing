<ABSTRACT>
Methods are disclosed for the production of anti-self antibodies and antibody fragments, being antibodies or fragments of a particular species of mammal which bind self-antigens of that species. Methods comprise providing a library of replicable genetic display packages (rgdps), such as filamentous phage, each rgdp displaying at its surface a member of a specific binding pair which is an antibody or antibody fragment, and each rgdp containing nucleic acid sequence derived from a species of mammal. The nucleic acid sequence in each rgdp encodes a polypeptide chain which is a component part of the sbp member displayed at the surface of that rgdp. Anti-self antibody fragments are selected by binding with a self antigen from the said species of mammal. The displayed antibody fragments may be scFv, Fd, Fab or any other fragment which has the capability of binding antigen. Nucleic acid libraries used may be derived from a rearranged V-gene sequences of unimmunised mammal. Synthetic or artificial libraries are described and shown to be useful.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the isolation of antibody
molecules directed against self antigens, in particular human
antibodies directed against human self antigens. Phage
display technology for selection of antibody molecules
was described in WO92/01047, PCT/GB92/00883,
PCT/GB92/01755 and GB9206372.6. The applicants have
realised that antibodies directed against self antigens
can be isolated using phage display technology.Human antiself antibodies are of particular value
for in vivo therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, since
they avoid the problems arising from the antigenicity of
foreign, e.g. mouse antibodies. The most useful human
antibodies for therapy are those directed against cell
surface molecules, such as receptors, adhesins and
integrins, and those directed against circulating
biological effector molecules, such as hormones, growth
factors and cytokines. It has been extremely difficult to
obtain human antibodies against such self antigens. This
invention provides a powerful way of obtaining such
antibodies.It is a demanding task to isolate an antibody
fragment with specificity against self antigen. Animals
do not normally produce antibodies to self antigens, a
phenomenon called tolerance (G.J.Nossal Science 245
147-153, 1989). Autoimmune diseases may result from a
breakdown in tolerance. In general, vaccination with a
self antigen does not result in production of circulating
antibodies. It is therefore difficult to raise
antibodies to self antigens, particularly in humans. It
is possible to raise antibodies that recognise human
antigens in an animal such as a mouse, especially if the
human antigen is not too closely related to any
equivalent in the animal. If a human antibody is then
required it is necessary to 'humanise' the antibody, e.g.
by CDR grafting (patent GB2188638B).Phage antibody technology as described in
(WO92/01047) offers the ability to isolate such human
antibodies directly. In this application, we demonstrate 
for the first time that antibodies against self-antigens
can be isolated from phage libraries derived from, for
example, nonimmunised sources and from libraries prepared
by synthetic recombination of V-gene sequences,
preferably recombination of VH with, DH and JH, and VL
with JL sequences. These antibodies are specific for
their antigen. This application shows that single
libraries derived in this manner can act as a source of
both foreign and self antigens and opens up the prospect
of a large, universal library to isolate antibodies to
any antigen.It was disclosed in
