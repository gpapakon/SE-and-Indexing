<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a semi-solid pharmaceutical agent 
containing a stabilized proteinaceous bioactive substance 

prepared by successively mixing an oligosaccharide and an 
aqueous solution of a proteinaceous bioactive substance, and 

kneading the resultant solids with an oil or fat base. The 
pharmaceutical handles with ease because it is readily 

administered to the body through percutaneous and permucosal 
route which are safer and less in pain administration routes 

than other conventional administrations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semi-solid pharmaceutical composition
and a process to produce the same, in particular, a stabilized semi-solid
pharmaceutical composition with proteinaceous bioactive substances and a process
to produce the same.Semi- solid pharmaceutical compositions containing chemicals
as effective ingredient such as those in ointment or suppository
form have been produced hitherto by simply kneading
effective ingredients and bases. In case that effective
ingredients are proteinaceous bioactive substances such as
cytokines and hormones which are relatively labile, unlike
chemicals, if one kneads them into semi-solid, then he or she
will find that they have been already inactivated or they are
still susceptive to inactivation and this renders such a semi-solid
infeasible in actual uses.Because of this, proteinaceous bioactive substances
have been prepared into liquid forms where their activities
were stably retained and then administered by injection through
subcutaneous or intramuscular route in order for treatment of 
susceptive diseases, for example, immunopathies, viral disease,
abnormalities in hormone secretion and malignant tumors.While proteinaceous bioactive substances were found
later to be very efficacious in treatment of trauma in the
skin and mucous membranes as well as of such a susceptive
disease, therefore other administration methods such as
percutaneous and permucosal injections, which are usually
deemed to be safer and less in pain, have been preferred. Thus
development of . semi-solid pharmaceutical agents using
proteinaceous bioactive substances in stabilized form have been
in great demand.EP-0,533,938 describes a rectal preparation for suppositories, comprising
calcitonin. The preparation also comprises mannitol and Pharmasol B-105.FR-2-620,331 describes a rectal preparation for suppositories. The preparation
comprises mannitol, calcitonin and an excipient.EP-0,504,483 describes a rectal preparation for suppositories comprising mannitol
and calcitonin. The composition also comprises suppository mass and vaseline oil.EP-0-080,879 discloses a dental pasta composition. The composition comprises
inteferon, a sugar alcohol and Tween 80 (a surfactant). WO-91/13601 discloses a rectal preparation for suppositories comprising mannitol
and calcitonin. In addition the composition comprises Suppocire A1X.The present invention relates to a semi-solid pharmaceutical composition
and a process to produce the same, in particular, a stabilized semi-solid
pharmaceutical
