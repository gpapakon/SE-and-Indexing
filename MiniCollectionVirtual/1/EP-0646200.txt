<ABSTRACT>
A four sided tile (1), particularly for paving, flooring or cladding comprises a first side edge (2), a second slide edge (3) parallel with and shorter than the first side edge (2), and third and fourth side edges (4, 5) which are not parallel. The length of the shorter side edges (3, 4, 5) is the same and the sum of their length is equal to the length of the larger side (2). The side edges (2, 3, 4, 5) are preferably curved with radii of equal length.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "A tile"The invention relates to tiles.In this specification the term "tiles" refers to non-fired or fired clay or cementitious bricks, blocks, slabs or tiles, ceramic or other glazed tiles, parquet tiles, wooden tiles, vinyl tiles, linoleum tiles, cork tiles, quarry tiles and any similar constructional elements whether for interior or exterior use as wall tiles, ceiling tiles, floor tiles, tiles for roadways, footways, entrance drives, or the like, paving tiles, cladding, building generally or similar use.Several different types of tiles are available however, they are often limited as regards resistance to breakage and/or interlocking and especially as regards the scope for laying a range of different aesthetically pleasing patterns.The object of the invention is to provide an improved tile which will overcome at least some of these problems.According to the invention there is provided a tile etc. as per new claim 1. Preferably the second side edge is opposite and generally parallel to the first side edge.In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the side edges are of curvilinear shape, the curvilinear shape of the second, third and forth side edges being substantially the same and conforming with the curvilinear shape of part of the first side edge.Most preferably the curvilinear shape is generally arcuate and the radius of the arc of the second, third and forth side edges is substantially equal and also equal to the 

radius of the first side edge. Preferably the second, third and forth side edges are of generally concave shape and the first side edge is of generally convex shape.In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention all the side edges are curved, each side edge being a portion of a circle, and the radii of curvature of all of the side edges are equal.In one embodiment of the invention the first and third and first and forth side edges respectively subtend of an angle of approximately 60°.In one embodiment of the invention the tile has embossed or imprinted thereon a pattern. The pattern may for example comprise curvilinear shapes extending from the midpoint of the second side edge, to points of substantially 1/2 and ~/3 the length of the first side edge. Preferably the radius of the curvilinear pattern is the same as the radius of the second, third and forth side edges.In another embodiment of the invention the first side edge comprises a number of portions which extend at angles to one another. Preferably the angle subtended between adjacent first side edge

CLAIMS
1. A tile having a first side edge, a second side edge, and third and fourth side edges which extend between the first and second side edges, the second, third and fourth side edges being of substantially equal length and the length of the first side edge being substantially the sum of the lengths of the other three side edges.
2. A tile as claimed in claim 1 wherein the second side edge is opposite and generally parallel to at least portion of the first side edge.
3. A tile as claimed in claims 1 or 2 wherein the side edges are of curvilinear shape, the curvilinear shape of the second, third and forth side edges being substantially the same and conforming with the curvilinear shape of part of the first side edge.
4. A tile as claimed in claim 3 wherein the curvilinear shape is generally arcuate and the radius of the arc of the second, third and forth side edges is substantially equal and also equal to the radius of the first side edge.
5. A tile as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the second, third and forth side edges are of generally concave shape and the first side edge is of generally convex shape.
6. A tile as claimed in any of claims 3 to 5 wherein all of the side edges are curved, each side edge being a portion of a circle, and the radii of curvature of all of the side edges are equal. 


7. A tile as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the first and third and first and forth side edges respectively subtend of an angle of approximately 60°.
8. A tile as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the tile has embossed or imprinted thereon a pattern.
9. A tile as claimed in claim 8 wherein the pattern comprises curvilinear shapes extending from the midpoint of the second side edge, to points of substantially V
3
 and 
2
/
3
 the length of the first side edge.
10. A tile as claimed in claim 9 wherein the radius of the curvilinear pattern is the same as the radius of the second, third and forth side edges.
11. A tile as claimed in claims 1, 2, 7 or 8 wherein the first side edge comprises a number of portions which extend at angles to one another.
12. A tile as claimed in claim 11 wherein the angle subtended between adjacent first side edge portions is 120°.
13. A tile as claimed in claims 11 or 12 wherein there are three first side edge portions of equal length and each having the same length as the length of the second, third and fourth side edges.
14. A tile as claimed in any preceding claim comprising a number of sub tiles joined together. 


15. A tile as claimed in claim 14 wherein the sub tiles are joined by means of a mesh.
16. A tile as claimed in claims 14 or 15 wherein frangible links are provided between at least some of the sub tiles.
17. A tile substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the drawings.
18. A composite tile comprising a tile as claimed in any preceding claim with another similar tile or tiles or part(s) thereof.
19. A filler and/or tile piece for fitting between a tile or tiles as claimed in any preceding claim and a boundary, the filler and/or tile piece at least partly conforming to portion of a tile as claimed in any preceding claim.
20. A tiling assembly comprising a plurality of tiles as claimed in any preceding claim.
21. A tiling system such as a pavement, floor, wall, wall cladding or the like formed from a plurality of tiles as claimed in any of claims 1 to 19.
22. A laid tiling system such as a pavement, floor, wall, wall cladding or the like formed from a plurality of tiles as claimed in any preceding claim laid in side-by-side relation.
23. A laid tiling system substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
