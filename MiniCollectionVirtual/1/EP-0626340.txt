<ABSTRACT>
A filler valve group comprises a device for 
activating an obturator (12) of a liquid flow pipe 

(1), which obturator (12) mechanically closes the 
liquid flow pipe (1) independently of filler 

machine speed. At the same time a hydraulic 
closure of the liquid flow pipe (1) is achieved by 

a filler liquid reaching a prefixed level, whereat 
the liquid contacts a lower end of a liquid return 

pipe (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a valve filler group for 
container filler machines. Isobarometric machines are well-known having 
filler valve groups provided with two coaxial 
pipes, one for the liquid and another for the gas 
(normally carbon dioxide or oxygen), both usually 
kept closed by the internal filler tank pressure, 
which is greater than the elastic spring force 
acting in favour of opening. When a hermetic coupling has been achieved between 
the container mouth and the lower part of the 
filler valve group, a mechanical positioner opens 
the gas valve and brings the container to the same 
pressure as the gaseous phase of the filler tank, 
known as the isobarometric phase. Once equality of 
pressure has been reached, the liquid valve 
spontaneously opens following the spring action 
and the filling operation begins, the air in the 
container exiting through a return pipe. The filling operation stops hydraulically when the  
 
liquid level in the container touches the lower 
end of the return pipe. The liquid valve stays mechanically open up until 
it contacts with a command moving a mechanical 
positioner which in its turn closes both the 
liquid valve and the gas valve. Subsequently the 
pressure inside the container is expelled into the 
atmosphere through a small snift valve. In such fillers, in the absence of a container or 
when a container explodes, the liquid valve closes 
automatically, notwithstanding the antagonist 
spring pressure, because of the pressure 
difference between the tank and the outside 
environment: in this way undue waste is avoided. Delay in closure of the liquid valve, when the 
closure is hydraulic, can be significantly long, 
especially when the filler slows or stops, because 
the air closed in the container tends to invade 
the liquid valve, causing changes in filler 
levels, and the liquid also tends to rise 
internally of the return pipe up to a level which 
is equal to that of the tank level, obeying the 
principle of communicating chambers. To avoid such air invasion, air barriers have been 
used, such as for example a syphon passage or a  
 
metal net: in traditional filler machines, to 
solve the problem of liquid flow-back, the liquid 
is usually blown out of the return pipe when the 
valve group is between the exit star conveyor and 
the entry star conveyor, that is at the end of 
each filling operation and before the next. A further drawback of such valve groups is that 
they need to operate at rather a high pressure 
(about half a bar). The principal aim of

<CLAIMS>
A valve filler group in filler machines for liquid 
containers, comprising 


a liquid flow pipe (1) for inflow of liquid from 
a tank to a container (10) positioned coaxially 

below the liquid flow pipe (1), said liquid flow 
pipe (1) being provided with an obturator (12) to 

close the liquid flow towards the container (10); 
a pipe (9, 19) for gas or air inserted at least 
partially in the liquid flow pipe (1), and 

coaxially to the liquid flow pipe (1); 
 
characterised in that it comprises a device for 

activating the obturator (12) of the liquid flow 
pipe (1) in order to bring about a mechanical 

closure of said pipe (1), independently of a speed 
at which the filler machine is operating, and 

contemporaneously with a hydraulic closure of said 
liquid flow pipe (1) caused by a reaching of a 

desired level of liquid in a container (10), where 
the liquid contacts a lower end of a return pipe 

(19). 
A valve group as in claim 1, characterised in that 
the device comprises a connection membrane (3) 

between the gas pipe (9) and the liquid flow pipe 
(1), said membrane (3) permitting movement of the 

gas pipe (9) with respect to the liquid flow pipe 
(1), and being of a sufficient length to guarantee 

that a pressure present in the two said pipes (1, 
9) at a reaching of a predetermined liquid level 

in the container (10) is such as to force the gas 
pipe (9) upwards into a position in which the 

obturator (12) is closed. 
A valve group as in claim 1, wherein the device 
comprises a level sensor (21) for perceiving a 

presence of liquid and for activating, through an 
amplifier (23), a solenoid valve (24) which, by 

increasing or diminishing an air flow section 
towards an outflow channel (4), causes either an 

opening or a closing of the liquid flow pipe (1). 
A valve group as in claim 2, characterised in that 
it comprises a cam (17) for bringing a stem (7) of 

the valve group to assume a plurality of different 
angular positions, each said position 

corresponding to a diameter of a calibrated 
 

orifice (6) releasing air or gas. 
A valve group as in claim 1, wherein the device 
comprises a chamber (16) situated above the gas 

pipe (9) and kept separate from the zone comprised 
between the pipes (1 and 9), a chamber internal 

pressure level depending either on an opening of a 
valve (5) placing said chamber (16) in 

communication with an outside environment, or on a 
return of air from the container (10) during a 

filling phase; a variation of pressure in the 
chamber (16) causing a descent of the gas pipe (9) 

with a flow of liquid, or a rising of the gas pipe 
(9) into a closed position. 
A valve group as in claim 5, wherein the chamber 
(16) is provided with a calibrated orifice (6) for 

expelling the air into the outside environment, 
such that return air coming from the container 

(10) does not come into contact with a product. 
A valve group as in claim 1, wherein the device is 
constituted by a floating piston provided with a 

gasket, said piston being solid with the gas pipe 
(9) and moving between an upper position in which 

 
it is open for a flow of liquid and a lower 

position in which it is closed to such flow.
