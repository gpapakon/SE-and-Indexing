<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a sensor switch (11) with a first sensor (5) which reacts to movement and has a first monitored detection (sensing) range (12) in which there is additionally provided a second sensor (8) which reacts to infrared beams (rays) and has a second monitored detection range (13). The second detection range is situated inside the first detection range and is smaller than the latter. The second sensor (8) is released by the first sensor (5) as soon as the latter detects a movement. The temperature recorded by the second sensor at the time of release is stored as a reference temperature. The output signals (A,B) of the sensors (5,8), which are conditioned by evaluation stages (7,10), are combined with one another via an OR gate (7) to the output signal (C) of the sensor switch (11).

Sensor switch for switching a light source 
on/off, 


having a first sensor (5) reacting to movement and 
having a first monitored detection area (12) and a 

first evaluation stage (7), 
having a second sensor (8) reacting to infrared rays 
and having a second monitored detection area (13), 

which is within the first detection area and is 
smaller than the latter, and a second evaluation 

stage (10), 
the first evaluation stage (7) being designed such 
that, if a person enters the first detection area 

(12), an output signal A is generated, which produces 
a switch-on signal for the light source, via 

an OR gate (4) and simultaneously enables the second 
evaluation stage (10), which is designed such that 

the temperature that is registered at the enable 
time is stored as a reference temperature, 
the second evaluation stage (10) being designed such 
that the increase in temperature, caused by the 

person entering the second detection area (13), 
above the stored reference temperature generates an 

output signal (B) which, via the OR gate (4) generates 
a switch-on signal for the light source, 
and the output signals of the first and second 
evaluation stage, respectively, falling if there is 

no movement or if the registered temperature returns 
to the stored reference value. 
Sensor switch according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a passive infrared sensor is employed as first 

sensor (5). 
Sensor switch according to Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized in that a thermocouple sensor is used as 

second sensor (8). 
Sensor switch according to Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized in that a thermopile sensor is used as 

second sensor (8).  
 
Sensor switch according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that an active infrared detector, which 

evaluates the reflected light from an infrared transmitting 
diode, is employed as second sensor (8).
