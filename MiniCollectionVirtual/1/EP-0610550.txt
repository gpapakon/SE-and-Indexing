<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sampler for a molten bath with a flat sample chamber (2) which is arranged in a support tube (1) and which has an inlet duct (4) with a flow-in opening (5) arranged on the side of the flat sample chamber facing away from the immersion end of the support tube and which has a wall surface which forms a sample analysis surface and runs parallel to the axis of the support tube. In order to produce a sampler which makes it possible to obtain high-quality flat samples as well as their easy removability from the sampler, there is arranged, inside the support tube, at the end of the inlet duct facing away from the immersion end of the support tube above the flat sample chamber between the inlet duct and the flow-in opening a pre-chamber (3), the cross-sectional area of which transversely to the flow-in direction through the flow-in opening is greater than the cross-sectional area of the flow-in opening and the cross-sectional area of which transversely to the axis of the inlet duct in the region of its inlet is greater than the cross-sectional area of the inlet of the inlet duct.

A sampler for molten metal with a flat sample chamber
arranged in a carrier tube, which chamber has an inlet duct,

arranged on the side of the flat sample chamber facing away
from the immersion end of the carrier tube, with an inflow

opening, and which has a wall surface forming a sample
analysis surface, which runs approximately parallel to the

axis of the carrier tube, wherein a pre-chamber (3) is
arranged inside the carrier tube (1) on the end of the inlet

duct (4) facing away from the immersion end of the carrier
tube (1), above the flat sample chamber (2) between the

inlet duct (4) and the inflow opening (5), the cross-sectional
area of which pre-chamber (3) transversely to the

inflow direction through the inflow opening (5) is greater
than the cross-sectional area of the inflow opening (5) and

the cross-sectional area of which transversely to the axis
of the inlet duct (4) in the region of its inlet is greater

than the cross-sectional area of the inlet of the inlet duct
(4), characterised in that the wall thickness of the pre-chamber

(3) in the region of its immersion end amounts to
approximately 1 to 5 mm and in the region facing away from

the immersion end amounts to approximately 2 to 10 mm, the
inflow opening (5) being arranged in the region with the

greater wall thickness facing away from the immersion end.
A sampler according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the walls (9) of the pre-chamber (3) and the edging of the

inflow opening (5) are formed from high-melting metal.
A sampler according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the pre-chamber (3) and inlet duct (4) are constructed

so as to be cylindrical and the diameter of the pre-chamber
(3) is at least twice as great as the diameter of the inlet

duct (4).
A sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the diameter of the inlet duct (4) is

smaller than the diameter of the inflow opening (5).
A sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the diameter of the pre-chamber (3)

amounts to approximately 22 to 50 mm.
A sampler according to Claim 5, characterised in that
the diameter of the pre-chamber (3) amounts to approximately

30 to 40 mm.
A sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the diameter of the inlet duct (4)

amounts to approximately 5 to 11 mm.
A sampler according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the diameter of the inlet duct (4) amounts to approximately

8 to 9 mm.
A sampler according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the wall thickness of the pre-chamber (3) amounts to

approximately 1 to 2 mm in the region of its immersion end
and amounts to approximately 3 to 4 mm in the region facing

away from the immersion end.
A sampler according to Claim 1 or 9, characterised in
that the region with the smaller wall thickness is

approximately 1 to 3 times as long as the region with the
greater wall thickness.
A sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the flat sample chamber (2) has at

least two chamber regions with differing thickness which are
arranged one behind the other, viewed in the inlet

direction, the chamber region with the greater thickness
being arranged in the end of the flat sample chamber (2)

facing away from the immersion end.
