<DESCRIPTION>
#RESTROOM ORGANIZER AND STERILIZING APPARATUSThis invention provides a restroom organizer which combines toiletries, various necessities and electric apparatus together to be used in a restroom in a more compact fashion.There are many items which can be used to clean and make up an individual's body. These items are frequently spread around the restroom. For example, each individual takes his or her toothbrush from the storage case, gets the toothpaste from a separate tube, cleans their teeth and returns the tube and brush to their storage cases. Or, an individual may use an electric toothbrush in the restroom and set it on an electric charging apparatus out of the restroom if there is no facility in the bathroom. When an individual washes their hair they take the proper amount of shampoo from a bottle by turning the bottle up-side-down and then putting the bottle back in its place. After washing their hair the individual will go to the counter or sink to put lotions and other creams on their body.Thus, the various toilet necessities are spread about the bathroom and need to be arranged in a more compact manner. The purpose of this invention is to group these necessities into one automated compound or organizer. Another purpose of the invention is to build an organizer for electric devices which includes an AC-DC converter for an electric toothpaste dispenser, an electric toothbrush and its associated charging apparatus, a sterilizer, electric razor and its charging apparatus and a toiletry set and soap supplier. The system also includes an electric circuit for control of the organizer.There are two kinds of sterilizers, one for domestic use and another for professional use.The domestic sterilizer consists of a sterilizing light and is operated by a switch when it is needed. The professional sterilizer is structured and used for a specific purpose. It is limited to sterilizing only specific items. For instance, a toothbrush sterilizer cannot be used for any other item except for a toothbrush, and the sterilizing light bulb which is the essential component stays on for a unnecessary length of time. Therefore, it waste more electricity and shortens the light bulbs life.The sterilizer is designed to improve upon the above shortcomings. It turns on and off when the door is opened and closed and the sterilizing light turns on for a preset period of time.For example, the light can be designed to turn on for two minutes while the sterilization process is carried our with the music or a melody playing during
