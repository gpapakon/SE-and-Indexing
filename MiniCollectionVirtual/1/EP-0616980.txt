containing nitroaromatic and nitrophenolic compounds to a range from 

about 2 to 4.5, 
(b) contacting the acidic aqueous stream with sufficient 
hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion under conditions to effect oxidation 

of the nitrophenolic compounds, 
(c) adjusting the acidic, oxidized aqueous waste stream having a 
reduced nitrophenolic content to about pH ≧ 4, and 
(d) contacting the aqueous waste stream with a carbon adsorbent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for removing nitroaromatic 
and nitrophenolic compounds from an aqueous waste stream. Production of nitroaromatic compounds from the mixed acid 
nitration of benzene or toluene is accompanied by the production of 
nitrophenolic by-products. It is common industrial practice to remove 
these nitrophenolic by-products from the nitroaromatic hydrocarbon 
reaction product by an aqueous alkaline washing step. This alkaline 
aqueous waste stream containing the nitrophenolic by-products is also 
saturated with nitroaromatic hydrocarbons. Reduction of the concentration of priority pollutant 
nitrophenolics and nitroaromatic hydrocarbons to less than one part per 
million (sub-ppm) in aqueous waste streams discharged to the environment 
is a very recent requirement in most industrialized nations. The 
specific priority pollutants addressed are 2-nitrophenol, 4-nitrophenol, 
4,6-dinitro-o-cresol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 
2,4-dinitrotoluene and nitrobenzene. U.S. 4,604,214 discloses a process for removing trinitrocresols 
and picric acid contaminants from a wastewater stream generated in the 
production of nitroaromatics. The process involves contacting the crude 
dinitrotoluene generated by the mixed acid technique with an alkaline 
medium to generate an alkaline wash water containing water soluble 
nitrocresols and picric acid. The wash water is treated with aqueous 
acid in sufficient amounts to reduce the pH to 3-4. After pH adjustment 
the aqueous medium is contacted with hydrogen peroxide and a ferrous ion 
under conditions to effect oxidation of a substantial portion of the 
trinitrocresol to carboxylic acid, nitric acid and carbon dioxide. U.S. 4,804,480 discloses a process for destroying polynitrophenols 
or their salts in an aqueous waste by treating with at least 2 moles of 
hydrogen peroxide per mole of polynitrophenol in the presence of from 
0.002 to 0.7 moles of an iron salt per mole of polynitrophenol. The  
 
destruction takes place at a pH lower than 4 and a temperature greater 
than 65°C. U.S. 4,925,565 discloses a process for the reprocessing of 
nitrophenolic by-products, which are contained in the wastewater from a 
nitration, through solvent extraction, distillative recovery of the 
solvent and recovery of a nitrophenolic residue and incineration of the 
nitrophenolic residue. Incineration or wet air oxidation are processes which are not economically 
viable for aqueous streams that are relatively low in organic 
content (about 1 wt%).
