<ABSTRACT>
In a fixing device, a core material of a fixing rotating 
member (9) has a largest-diameter portion (a) between a central 

portion and each end portion within a region where a recording 
material of the largest size passes, and the diameter of 

the core material is gradually reduced from the largest-diameter 
portion (a) toward the inside and the outside. The 

outer shape of the fixing rotating member (9) conforms to the 
shape of the core material. According to this configuration, 

it is possible to prevent corrugation and curl of the 
recording material, and to provide excellent mountability of 

the recording material. A nip is formed by a pressing rotating 
member. The pressing rotating member has a straight or inversecrown 

shape and a hardness of at least 30° and equal to or less than 70°. In 
another embodiment the outer diameter of said fixing rotating member is 

equal to or less than 30mm, the inclination of said fixing rotating 
member from the largest diameter portion toward the outside is at least 

0,02 and equal to or less than 0,2, and the inclination is constant or 
increases toward each end portion. In an image fixing apparatus 

comprising a heater, a movable film in contact with said heater and 
movable together with a recording material and a pressing member forming 

a nip with said heater through said film, the heater is gradually 
separated from said pressing member toward the outside at positions 

corresponding to the ends of the recording material or the width of said 
heater is gradually reduced toward the outside at the same positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fixing device.
More particularly, the invention relates
to a heating fixing device which is configured by a
fixing member and a pressing member disposed in pressure
contact with each other.Among conventional fixing devices included in image
forming apparatuses which adopt an electrophotographic
method, an electrostatic recording method, or the like, so-called
heating fixing devices are widely used, in which an
unfixed toner image carried on a transfer material is fixed
as a permanent image by passing the transfer material
through a nip portion formed by a fixing roller and a pressing
roller which rotate in pressure contact.with each other.
In such a heating fixing apparatus, in order to prevent 
creases in the transfer material produced by passing it
through the nip portion, at least one of the fixing
roller and the pressing roller is generally configured in
a so-called inverse-crown shape, in which the outer
diameter at two end portions in the longitudinal
direction has a largest value, and the outer diameter at
a central portion has a smallest value. However, the
roller having such a configuration forcedly stretches the
transfer material in the longitudinal direction of the
roller, so that two end portions of the transfer
material, which is not rigid, are corrugated, thereby
degrading, in some cases, the quality of the obtained
image. In order to prevent such corrugation, a proposal
has been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,130,754 (Japanese
Patent Laid-open Application (Kokai) No. 2-262684
(1990)), in which portions having the largest diameter of
the pressing roller configured in the inverse-crown shape
are positioned inside the two ends of the roller to form
slight stripes at portions of the transfer material
facing that portions, so that two end portions of the
transfer material are strengthened.US-A-5,130,754 describes an image forming apparatus
with a pressing roller having its maximum diameters
between a longitudinal center and one longitudinal end
and between the center and the other longitudinal end
thereof and it is made of heat-resistive rubber. The
fixing roller is of straight cylindrical shape.JP-A-60 100 164 describes a fixing roller of
straight cylindrical shape and a pressing roller coated
by a layer of heat resistant rubber. The pressing roller
has a narrow width central part and both ends have a
width which increases gradually.However, keen researches made by the inventors of
the present application have cleared that even in the
above-described proposal, when
