<ABSTRACT>
Mild soap bars containing low levels of cationic polymeric skin mildness aid, polyethoxylated nonionic detergent surfactant to decrease scum formation and inhibit frosting, i.e., crystallization of nonionic detergent surfactant on the bar surface, and water. These bars are not beta-phase bars.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED MILD SOAP-SYNBARTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to cleansing soap bars, preferably superfatted, containing cationic polymer mildness additive and a nonionic surfactant for scum dispersion.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The formulation of ultra-mild personal cleansing preparations has become a focus of great interest. When people wash and scrub their skin with various surface-active preparations frequently, mildness is very important. Ideal cleansers should be cost effective, cleanse gently and rinse well. Most toilet bars fall short in this respect.Synthetic detergents are relatively expensive. None of the synthetic products as yet matches the low cost of soap when compared on a 100% active ingredient basis.The use of synthetic detergent surfactants in soap bars is well known, being documented in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 2,988,511, Mills et al., issued June 13, 1961; 3,043,778, Kelly, issued July 10, 1962; and 3,598,746, Kaniecki et al., issued Aug. 10, 1971, said patents being incorporated herein by reference.U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,470, Tokosh et al., issued Dec. 25, 1979, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method for making improved acyl isethionate detergent bars with from 2-6% of sodium alkoxy hydroxy propane sulfonate (a synonym for alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonate) with alkyl chains of from 8 to 22 carbon atoms in conjunction with a small amount of sodium chloride. 

 Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,447, Medcalf et al., issued April, 1989, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a mild soap bar comprising a polymeric skin mildness aid. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,170, Dawson et al., entitled "In Beta-Phase Bar Form Containing Soap, High HLB Nonionic Surfactant, and Water-Soluble Polymer," issued Jan. 15, 1991, and U.S. Pat. Nos.: 2,988,511, supra; 2,989,547, Whyte, issued June 20, 1961; 2,999,068, Pilcher et al., issued Sept. 5, 1961; and 3,024,273, Whyte et al., issued Mar. 6, 1962, are all incorporated herein by reference.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is an improved milled, mild personal cleansing soap-synthetic bar comprising: a mixture of soap, a cationic polymeric skin mildness aid, a selected C1 -C20 alkyl poly- ethoxylate (65-100) nonionic detergent surfactant for inhibiting frosting and the formation of crystals on the bar surface upon storage, and water. The selected nonionic also inhibits scum formation. The bars of this invention have good lather characteristics. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONDisclosed is a milled soap-synthetic bar

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS :
1. A milled soap-synthetic bar comprising:
(1) from 45% to 90%, preferably from 55% to 80%, of soap;
(2) from 0.5% to 5%, preferably from 0.5% to 2%, of cationic polymeric skin mildness aid; (3) from 1% to 8%, preferably from 2% to 5%, of C14.-20. preferably Ci6_i8, alkyl polyethoxylate nonionic deter¬ gent surfactant containing from 65 to 100, preferably from 70 to 90, ethylene oxide moieties per molecule; and (4) from 7% to 12% water.
2. The bar of Claim 1 wherein said alkyl polyethoxylate (3) has an HLB of from 15 to 19.2, preferably from 17 to 19.
3. The bar of Claim 2 wherein said cationic polymeric skin mildness aid (2) is selected from the group consisting of: cationic polysaccharides, cationic copolymers of saccharides and synthetic cationic monomers, and synthetic polymers selected from the group consisting of: (a) cationic polyalkylene imines, (b) cationic ethoxy polyalkylene imines, and (c) cationic poly[N-{-3- (dimethylammonio)propyl}-N'-{3-(ethyleneoxyethylene dimethylammo- nio)propyl}urea dichloride].
4. The bar of Claim 2 wherein said alkyl is a straight chain al yl.
5. The bar of Claim 1 containing as an additional ingredient from 2% to 15% of moisturizer.
6. The bar of Claim 5 wherein said moisturizer is selected from the group consisting of glycerin and fatty acids and the level of said moisturizer is from 7% to 12%.
7. The bar of Claim 6 wherein said moisturizer comprises from 4% to 8% of said fatty acid and from 2% to 6% of said glycerin. 


8. The bar of Claim 6 wherein said fatty acids are derived from tallow, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil stearin, or mix¬ tures thereof.
9. The bar of Claim 8 wherein said soap is derived from fatty acids which are derived from tallow, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil stearin, or mixtures thereof.
