<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closure for single or multifilamentary composite billet, the billet consisting of a tubular body filled with metal filaments, each end of the tubular body being closed off by the said closure (11) which has two principal faces, a first principal face (13) closing the inside of the tubular body and a second principal face (12) opposite the first one, characterised in that each of the two principal faces is provided with a groove (15, 16) which is closed on itself, one of the grooves surrounding the other and the depth of the grooves being such that they overlap.

<CLAIMS>
A closure part for closing a mono- or multi-filament compound
billet, the billet being constituted by a tubular body (2) filled

with one or more cylindrical components, each end of the tubular body
being closed by said closure part (11, 21) which presents two main

faces, a first main face (13, 23) closing the inside of the tubular
body, and a second main face (12, 22) opposite the first, the closure

part being characterized in that each of the two main faces is
provided with a closed loop groove (15, 16, 25, 26), one of the

grooves surrounding the other, the depth of the grooves being such
that they overlap.
A closure part according to claim 1, characterized in that the
grooves (15, 16, 25, 26) are circular and concentric to the axis of

the tubular body (2) when the closure part closes the tubular body.
A closure part according to claim 1, characterized in that the
grooves (15, 16, 25, 26) are straight grooves.
A closure part according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the width of the grooves and the distance

between them are such that, after an isostatic densification
operation of the billet, the grooves become completely or partly

filled in by the material constituting the closure part.
A closure part according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it is provided with a pumping tube (28).
