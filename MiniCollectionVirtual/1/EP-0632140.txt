the steps of: forming a Ni-P alloy coating layer containing P of 8 

to 15wt.% on at least one surface of a steel sheet; heat-treating the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing zinc 
coated steel sheet having excellent corrosion resistance suitable 
for automobile sheets. Steel sheets of automobile body are mainly rust-resistant 
steel sheets from the viewpoint of reliability to sustaining rust 
preventive performance for a long period of service. Among 
various kinds of the rust-resistant steel sheets, zinc coated steel 
sheet and alloyed zinc coated steel sheet are most widely used. 
Apart from zinc coated steel sheet and alloyed zinc coated steel 
sheet, corrosion-resistant steel sheets which improve their own 
corrosion resistance by their composition are also used. Examples 
of that type of corrosion-resistant steel sheet are disclosed in JP-A-54-75421 
and JP-A-56-9356 (the term "JP-A-" referred to herein 
signifies "unexamined Japanese patent publication"). Responding 
to the ever-increasing demand for corrosion resistance, a method 
to further improve the corrosion resistance of the corrosion-resistant 
steel sheet by applying a zinc coating to the surface of the steel 
sheet has also been proposed. An example of that kind of method  
 
for improving corrosion resistance is disclosed in JP-A-59-170288. In a corrosion-resistant steel sheet, the corrosion resistance is 
maintained with a stable rust layer which is formed on the surface 
of the steel sheet during the corrosion process. To form the stable 
rust layer, various kinds of additives are required, and a significant 
amount of those additives are needed to obtain a satisfactory 
corrosion resistance. The additives effectively used to form the 
stable rust layer are, however, limited to those applied during 
steelmaking process and existing in the surface layer among those 
uniformly distributed within the steel sheet. In other words, those 
additives remained inside the steel sheet are useless in terms of 
corrosion resistance. On the other hand, the additives also play a 
role to control the mechanical characteristics of the steel sheet. 
Accordingly, a restriction of the mechanical characteristics 
sometimes limits the amount of the additives for improving the 
corrosion resistance, which suppresses the sufficient effect of 
corrosion resistance. A method disclosed in JP-A-59-170288 improves the corrosion 
resistance by forming a zinc coating layer on a corrosion-resistant 
steel sheet. However, the presented zinc coating is an alloy 
electroplating, and the method has a disadvantage of high 
production cost compared with hot dip galvanizing method. The
