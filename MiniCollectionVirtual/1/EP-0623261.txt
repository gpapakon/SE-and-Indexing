<ABSTRACT>
A repeater system in a communication system including a base station and a mobile unit provides a communications link between the base station and the mobile unit when the mobile unit is located in an environment that is substantially closed off to high radio frequency communication between the base station and the mobile unit. The repeater system has a first linear two-way frequency converter including a high frequency port for two-way coupling to the base station and a low frequency port for two-way coupling to a low frequency signal that is capable of distributing radio frequency power through the closed environment. The low frequency port is connected to a cable which propagates and receives low radio frequency power within the closed environment. The repeater system also includes a first antenna for wireless coupling to the cable, and a second linear two-way frequency converter having a low frequency port connected to the first antenna for two-way coupling to a low frequency signal and a high frequency port for two-way coupling to a signal that is compatible with the high radio frequency signal used by the communications system. A second antenna is connected to the high frequency port of the second linear two-way frequency converter for wireless coupling of the second linear two-way frequency converter to a nearby mobile unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio coverage in
environments that are otherwise closed off to such
coverage, and more particularly to cellular radio
communications coverage in such closed off environments by
means of repeaters, and even more particularly to a
repeater system which converts communications system high
radio frequency signals into low radio frequency signals
for propagation in the closed off environment, and then
back into high radio frequency signals.In a cellular telephone system, each portable
telephone, referred to here as a mobile unit, is able to
function only to the extent that it is able to send and
receive radio signals to and from a base station associated
with the system. However, in the real world environment
there are impediments to normal radio communication. For
example, at frequencies of approximately 1 GHz or higher,
obstructions such as tunnels can attenuate the radio signal
50 dB/km up to total cut-off. The amount of attenuation
will depend on circumstances such as the shape of the
tunnel, and the presence of obstructions like trains. This
attenuation makes the radio propagation environment erratic
and unreliable.Prior attempts to radiate radio frequency (RF) power
into problematic isolated structures, referred to here as
closed environments, include the use of leaky coaxial cable 
in the structure, and also the brute force approach of
directing a large RF power level into the structure.
However, such approaches have proven to be both expensive
and prohibitively complicated.An example of using such a cable in a radio
transmission system to supply radio signal information to
an underground space is previously known by JP-A-4079617.
In this known system, slave stations are radio connected to
a satellite and to a central station and also via a
transmission cable to the central station. Underground
cables are provided to each of the slave stations and
transmisssion antennas are provided to these cables which
transmits the information to e.g. underground vehicles. In
this system the underground cable operates as a wired
transmission line and is provided with antennas in order to
radiate the information to the receivers in the underground
space.The present invention relates to a repeater system in
which the high frequency radio signals from a base station
are converted to low frequecy signals and radiated in the
closed space and after that again converted to high
frequency signals suitable for reception in a mobile
station.It is therefore one object of the present invention
