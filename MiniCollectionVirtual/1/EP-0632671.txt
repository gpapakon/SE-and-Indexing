<ABSTRACT>
A method for providing files to a remote node including the steps 
of determining whether bandwidth is available for transmitting across a 

communications link a file requested by a remote node, reserving 
bandwidth for the requested file if bandwidth is determined to be 

available, and opening the requested file for transmission only if 
bandwidth is reserved. In addition, an apparatus for providing files to 

a remote node including apparatus for determining whether bandwidth is 
available for transmitting across a communications link a file requested 

by a remote node, apparatus for reserving bandwidth for the requested 
file if bandwidth is determined to be available, and apparatus for 

opening the requested file for transmission only if bandwidth is 
reserved.

<DESCRIPTION>
Related patent applications include commonly assigned copending
patent application EP-A- 0 632 672
, entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING
MULTIMEDIA QUALITY OF SERVICE SESSIONS IN A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK" ;
commonly
assigned US-A-5 388 097,
entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD
FOR BANDWIDTH RESERVATION FOR MULTIMEDIA TRAFFIC IN COMMUNICATIONS
NETWORKS" ;
and commonly assigned copending patent application EP-A-0 632 673,
entitled
"MULTIMEDIA RESOURCE RESERVATION SYSTEM".The present invention relates to data processing systems and more
particularly to data processing systems providing resource reservation
to assure a desired quality of service.It has long been known to provide computer workstations
interconnected by digital communication networks whereby users of the
individual workstations may communicate with one another over the
network for tasks such as file serving from a host or server to client
computers. This has been previously common, for example, by means of a
typed note, data or program file transmitted to another user. More
recently, users have increasingly requested multimedia file services,
desktop conferencing, remote presentations, and other multimedia
applications between network users. However, such multimedia
applications utilizing data-intensive sound, voice, and video flows
require performance guarantees for high disk access and high bandwidth
communication links between distributed computing systems with minimal
communication delay, maximum throughput, and instantaneous burst 
communication capability. As a result, it has become very difficult to
schedule appropriate resources to meet the requirements of such
multimedia applications.Prior art has recognized that certain data in a network, such as
that associated with multimedia, may require priority handling. Thus,
for example, a "quality of service" (QOS) or bandwidth has been defined
in the literature. Quality of service or bandwidth seeks to describe
various parameters which may be specified in an attempt to define
certain minimum requirements which must be met for transmission of given
data types over the network. See, for example, quality of service
standards set forth in the OSI TP4 Open System Interconnect Standard
X.214 and the quality of service standards defined in CCITTQ.931 (ISDN),
Q.933 (frame relay), and Q.93B (B-ISDN ATM) drafts. As yet another
example there is an architected priority mechanism in the IEEE 802.5
Token Ring. A station on the ring with a high priority frame to send
may indicate this in an access control

<CLAIMS>
A method for providing files to a remote node across a communications
link in a communications network, comprising the steps of:


determining the bandwidth required for transmitting a file requested
by a remote node by reading a stored quality of service indication for

the requested file;
determining whether the required bandwidth is available for
transmitting the requested file across the communications link;
reserving bandwidth for the requested file if the bandwidth is
determined to be available; and,
in response to bandwidth being reserved for transmitting the file,
opening the requested file for transmission, such that the file is only

opened if bandwidth is reserved for transmitting the file.
A method according to claim 1, further comprising a step of notifying
the remote node when bandwidth is determined not to be available for

transmitting the requested file.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the quality of service indication for a
file for transmission across a communication link is stored when the file

is initially received by a receiving node.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the quality of service indication is
stored in file attributes, which are managed separately from the data

content of the file.
An apparatus for providing files to a remote node over a communications
link of a communications network, comprising: 


means for determining the bandwidth required for transmitting a file
requested by a remote node by reading a stored quality of service indication for

the requested file;
means for determining whether the required bandwidth is available for
transmitting across a communications link;
means for reserving bandwidth for the requested file if bandwidth is
determined to be available; and
means, responsive to bandwidth being reserved for transmitting the
file, for opening the requested file for transmission, such that the file

is only opened if bandwidth is reserved for transmitting the file.
Apparatus according to claim 5, further comprising means for
notifying the remote node when bandwidth is determined not to be available

for transmitting the file.
Apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6, including:

storage means for storing files to be processed and transmitted;
processing means for processing said stored files; and
means for determining bandwidth requirements for the file when the
file is initially received for storage on said storage means.
