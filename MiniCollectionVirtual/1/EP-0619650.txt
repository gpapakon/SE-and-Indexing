which comprises a control electrode and a first and a second main electrode, a first and 

a second input of the delay circuit being coupled to the control electrode of the first 
switching transistor and the second switching transistor, respectively. A first and a 

second output of the delay circuit are coupled to the second electrode of the first and the

power supply terminal. The outputs are coupled to a second power supply terminal 
via
 
respective load circuits. Respective clamp circuits are coupled to the outputs in order to 

limit maximum attainable differences between a voltage on the second power supply 
terminal on the one side and a voltage on the respective outputs on the other side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a delay circuit suitable for delaying of differential
signals, comprising a first and a second switching transistor, each of which comprises a
control electrode and a first and a second main electrode, a first and a second input of
the delay circuit being coupled to the control electrode of the first switching transistor
and the second switching transistor, respectively, the first main electrode of the first and
the second switching transistor being coupled to one another and, via a first current
source, to a first power supply terminal, the second main electrode of the first and the
second switching transistor being coupled to a first and a second output, respectively, of
the delay circuit, the first and second outputs being coupled to a second power supply
terminal via respective first load circuits, respective first clamp circuits being coupled to
the first and the second output in order to limit maximum attainable differences between
a voltage on the second power supply terminal on the one side and a voltage on the
respective outputs on the other side. The invention also relates to a cascade of such
delay circuits.A delay circuit of this kind is known from US pat. No. 4,876,519. The
first and the second switching transistor control the connection between the current
source and the load circuits. Depending on the difference between the voltages on the
inputs, the current flows from the current source through the first or through the second
switching transistor to the first or to the second output, respectively, and to the
associated load circuit. Thus, the capacitance present on the output is alternately
charged or discharged, depending on the difference.For example, when the first switching transistor is turned on, the voltage
on the first output decreases due to the discharging until the current source and the first
switching transistor are saturated. The voltage on the second output increases until the
associated load circuit is saturated.When the input voltage changes so that the second switching transistor is
turned on and the first switching transistor is turned off, the voltage on the second
output decreases and the voltage on the first output increases. After a delay time on the
outputs a voltage level is thus reached which suffices to switch over other circuits. The
rise and fall speed, and hence the delay time, can be adjusted by means of the current
through the current source. However, the switching time is also dependent on the initial voltage at the
instant of
