<ABSTRACT>
To provide ultrasonic treatment of animals, 
ultrasonic waves in a frequency range of between 15 

kilohertz and 100 kilohertz are applied to water in 
a tub with a power density between 0.1 and 5 watts 

per square centimeter. The equipment is able to 
apply ultrasonic waves with at least two power 

densities in the vicinity of the portion of the 
animal with one of said power densities being more 

than 15 watts per square meter for sterilizing the 
water before the patient enters the tub and the 

other being less than 15 watts per square meter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and equipment 
for treating animals including humans with 
ultrasonic waves for purposes of hygiene and therapy 
such as for example cleaning, microbicidal and 
antifungal activity and the promotion of epithelial 
healing. In one class of ultrasonic treatment, 
ultrasonic sound is applied to a working fluid by a 
transducer. The part of the animal to be treated is 
immersed in the working fluid and the transducer 
transmits vibrations in the ultrasonic range to that 
animal through the working fluid. In one prior art type of ultrasonic treatment 
for humans of this class, ultrasonic sound is 
applied to patients in a range of power levels of 
from 0 to 5 watts per square centimeter. It is 
generally used for stiff joints and muscular 
disorders. Other examples of treatment using 
ultrasound are provided in United States patent 
4,501,151 to Christman, issued February 26, 1985, 
for ULTRASONIC THERAPY APPLICATOR THAT MEASURES 
DOSAGE; United States patent 3,499,436 to Balamuth, 
issued March 10, 1970, for METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR  
 
TREATMENT OF ORGANIC STRUCTURES WITH COHERENT 
ELASTIC ENERGY WAVES; and United States patent 
3,867,929 to Joyner et al., issued February 25, 
1975, for ULTRASONIC TREATMENT DEVICE AND METHODS 
FOR USING THE SAME; and West German Utility model 
G8714883.8. The therapeutic treatment described in the 
prior art has several deficiencies, mainly arising 
from the failure to use appropriate frequencies and 
intensities of ultrasound. For example: (1) some 
frequencies and intensities increase the risk of 
overheating the underlying tissue of patients; and 
(2) some are not useable for hygienic purposes 
because the selected frequency is higher than 
desirable. Moreover, the prior art literature does 
not contemplate antiviral, antibacterial or 
antifungal activity and has not been applied in a 
manner to accomplish antiviral, antibacterial or 
antifungal activity in an effective manner. It is known to clean parts of the body with the 
aid of ultrasonic waves transmitted through a liquid 
medium. For example, United States patent 2,970,073 
to Prange, issued January 31, 1961, for METHOD FOR 
ULTRASONIC SURGICAL CLEANING OF HUMAN BODY MEMBERS 
discloses the use of ultrasonic sound in a range of  
 
between 10 to 200 kilocycles per second in a 
solution of water, germicide and surfectant to 
cleanse a surgeons hands. This patent recommends 
powers below 5 watts per square centimeter and 
frequencies between 15 to 50 kilocycles per second. Still

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for ultrasonic treatment of 
animals comprising a container (10) adapted to hold 

a working fluid in which at least a portion of an 
animal may be immersed for treatment by ultrasonic 

waves, and a generator (12) for applying ultrasonic 
waves to the working fluid within the container, 

characterized in that the generator (12) is adapted 
to apply ultrasonic sound waves in two selected 

ranges differing from each other at least in 
corresponding ones of two different time periods, 

wherein one of said selected ranges is in a power 
density range of less than 15 watts per square 

centimeter and a frequency range between 15 
kilohertz and 100 kilohertz and the other range is 

in a power density range greater than 15 watts per 
square cent
imeter. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the power density in the 

working fluid that is in contact with the animal is 
between 0.1 watts per square centimeter and 5 watts 

per square centimeter. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 
characterized by a probe (39) for sensing the power 

intensity of said ultrasonic waves in said working 
fluid, and a circuit for reducing the power emitted 

by said generator for applying ultrasonic waves when 
the power density measured by said probe (39) 

exceeds a predetermined value. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1-3, 
characterized by a sensor (17) for sensing the 

intrusion of an object into said working fluid; and 
circuit for reducing the power transmitted by said 

means for applying ultrasonic waves upon sensing the 
intrusion of an object into said working fluid. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1-4, 
characterized in that the generator (12) 

includes a vibrator (e.g. 34) and an interface (40) 
wherein said interface includes a plate mounted to 

said container (16) and positioned to be vibrated by 
said vibrator, whereby said vibrations are 

transmitted to said working fluid. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1-5, 
comprising valve means for supplying working 

fluid to the container characterized by a vacuum 
degasser (24) connected to the valve (26), for 

partly degassing the working fluid as it is supplied 
to the tank.
