<ABSTRACT>
In an airlock system, through which drums (1) containing 
radioactive material are transferred into a containment 

area (3), a passage (4) has an intermediate region (11), 
of reduced cross section relative to the inlet and outlet 

ends of the passage. The passage has a convergent inlet 
region (10) and a divergent outlet region (12) leading, 

respectively, to and from the intermediate region. The 
passage functions in the manner of a venturi so that an 

airstream is caused to flow along the passage towards the 
containment so as to inhibit the escape of atmosphere 

therefrom. A roller conveyor (20) transfers the items 
through the airlock system and a detector (19) monitors 

the atmosphere in the passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an airlock system for 
the transfer of items into a containment area. In 
particular, the invention relates to an airlock system 
whereby items such as drums or containers can be 
transferred without escape of atmosphere from the 
containment area. In the nuclear industry in particular there are 
processes where items have to be transferred into a 
containment, such as a glovebox, for treatment. The 
atmosphere within the containment may be radioactively 
contaminated and it is important to ensure that there is 
no escape of contaminants from the containment during the 
transfer procedure. In one such process, drums containing radioactively 
contaminated waste require to be transferred into a 
glovebox. In the glovebox the drums are compacted and 
placed in larger drums which are subsequently removed for 
grouting treatment and then discharged to a suitable 
storage facility. When transferring the drums into the 
glovebox it is important to ensure that there is no escape 
of atmosphere from the glovebox. This is particularly a 
problem when the drums are transferred at a relatively 
high rate so as to satisfy the requirements of the drum 
compaction equipment. GB-A-2.246.403 discloses an airlock system of the kind 
stated in the preamble of claim 1. This prior art airlock 
system also comprises means for producing an air flow in the 
airlock passage toward the containment area in order to prevent 
the escape of atmosphere from the containment area. According to the invention there is provided an 
airlock system for the transfer of items into a 
containment area, the system comprising a passage having 
an inlet opening at an inlet end thereof, an outlet 
opening at an outlet end thereof leading to the 
containment area, and an outlet door movable between open 
and closed positions at said outlet opening, wherein the 
passage has an intermediate region between the inlet and 
outlet ends, the intermediate region having a cross 
sectional area which is less than the cross sectional 
areas of the passage at its inlet and outlet ends, and  
 
wherein means are provided for producing an airstream 
which flows along the passage towards said containment 
area. The passage preferably includes a convergent inlet 
region leading from the inlet end to the intermediate 
region and a divergent region leading from the 
intermediate region to the outlet end. In a preferred embodiment the means for producing the 
airstream includes an inlet duct through which the 
airstream flows into the
