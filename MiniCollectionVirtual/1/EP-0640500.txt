<ABSTRACT>
An improved radial ply pneumatic tire 30 is 
described. The improved tire 30 has a first annular 

surface 23 located between the heel 22B and toe 22A of 
each bead 33,53,63 and a second surface 24 extending 

radially outwardly from the bead heel 22B. The first 
surface 23 is designed to be in contact with the bead 

seat 42 of the design rim 40 when the tire 30 is 
mounted and inflated to normal pressure. The first 

annular surface 23, when the tire 30 is unmounted, 
forms an average angle β with the axis of the tire, 

when the beads 33,53,63 are axially spaced a distance 
D equal to the design rim width. The average angle β 

is at least three degrees greater than the angle 
formed between the mating bead seat 42 of the design 

rim 40 and the axis of the tire. The second surface 
24 is designed to be in contact with an annular flange 

44 portion of the design rim 40 when the tire is 
mounted and inflated to normal pressure. The second 

surface 24A is inclined relative to a plane P 
perpendicular to the axis of rotation, at an angle α 

at least three degrees less than the angle formed 
between the rim flange 44 and the plane P. 
Preferably the angle α is in the range of 3° to 
20°) more preferably 3° to 15° while the angle β is in 

the range of 8° to 25°, more preferably 8° to 20°. 
The angular relationships relative to the design rim 

flange 44 permit the bead 33,53,63 and lower sidewall 

21B of the tire 30 to rotate slightly upon mounting to 
the design rim 40, thereby improving the stiffness and 

handling characteristics of the tire 30.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic radial ply 
tires and the interrelationship between the tire and 
its design rim. Historically, with the introduction of the 
tubeless type tire, the design fitment of the bead 
portions of the tire to the design rim has increased 
in significance. This fitment insures that the tire 
remains air tightly sealed and securely fixed to the 
rim during vehicle use. The typical rim has a bead seat and a rim flange 
that defines the contact zone with the tire bead. The 
tire bead has an annular surface between the bead heel 
and bead toe that upon assembly to the rim contacts 
the bead seat. The bead also has an annular surface 
radially outwardly of the bead heel, this annular 
surface contacts the rim flange when the tire is 
mounted and inflated on the rim. The prior art teaches the use of a rim with 
cylindrical or very slightly conical bead seats. 
Typically such bead seats were inclined at an angle of 
5° relative to the axis of rotation of the tire. To 
ensure a proper fitment, the tire beads had an annular 
surface having a similar 5° inclination relative to 
the axis of rotation, the beads having a slightly 
smaller diameter than the rim seat, thus upon 
assembly, a snug interference fit would be achieved. As a later development, the radially innermost 
flexible toe portion of the tire between the toe and 
the annular tensile member comprised an inclined 
surface about 5° greater than the rim seat. This  
 
added interference created by the angular variation 
facilitated sealing the tire. The prior art tires had beads with a surface 
radially outwardly of the bead heel. This surface was 
designed to contact the rim flange, both the rim 
flange and this axially and radially outwardly surface 
being oriented at 90° relative to the wheel axis. 
This area being under pressure while the tire is 
inflated contacts the rim flange essentially fastening 
the tire on the rim. The prior art tires essentially relied on the rim 
seat and flange orientation to establish the shape and 
orientation of the bead, with the exception being the 
flexible toe portion of the bead. A tire according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from JP-A-57 151 406. It has been discovered that a tire made according 
to the present invention, having unique bead surfaces 
for contacting the rim can result in a tire having 
improved lower sidewall stiffness, better rolling 
resistance and improved comfort. An improved radial ply pneumatic tire 30 is 
described. The tire 30 has an axis of rotation, a
