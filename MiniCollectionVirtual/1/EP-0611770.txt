<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of carboxylic acid halides. In particular, 
it relates to a process for preparing silyl esters of 
carboxylic acids which are directly convertible to acid 
halides. There are many methods available for 
preparing acid halides, most typically from the free-carboxylic 
acid itself. As to methods for preparing 
acid halides from the corresponding trialkylsilyl 
ester, U.S. Patent No. 4,070,710 teaches the chlorina- 
tion of a trimethylsilyl ester using thionyl chloride 
(SOCl₂). However, the anhydrous methodology required 
for these types of reactions makes commercial scale 
synthesis an oftentimes uneconomical. The present invention provides a method for 
converting the ammonium salt of various carboxylic 
acids to the corresponding trialkylsilyl ester, while 
utilizing a silylation catalyst, preferably a tetraalkyl 
ammonium halide. The resulting trialkylsilyl 
ester is then reacted insitu with a halogenating agent 
such as phosgene, to provide the acid chloride in 
excellent yield. Preferred silylating agents are the silylated 
amines such as hexamethyldisilazane, while the preferred 
silylation catalyst is a tetra-alkylammonium halide, 
especially tetra-n-butylammonium bromide. When the process is carried out under the 
preferred conditions, all by-products of the reaction  
 
are volatile, and thus, the acid halide formed may be 
used directly in a subsequent reaction without isolation. 
As such, the invention provides a process for 
preparing acid halides from the corresponding ammonium 
salt which is feasible on an industrial scale. The present invention provides a process for 
preparing trialkylsilyl esters of the formula 
which comprises reacting a compound of the formula 
with a trialkylsilylating reagent in an inert solvent in 
the presence of a silylation catalyst. In the above formulae, R is the residue of 
any carboxylic acid. Preferably, R is the residue of a 
carboxylic acid side chain (RC(O)-) typically found at 
the 7-position of cephalosporins and/or the 6-position 
of penicillins. R', R'' and R''' are individually C₁-C₆ 
alkyl groups. As an especially preferred embodiment, R is 
hydrogen; C₁-C₆ alkyl, C₁-C₆ alkyl substituted by 
cyano, carboxy, halogen, amino, C₁-C₄ alkoxy, C₁-C₄ 
alkylthio, or trifluoromethylthio;
 
 
a phenyl or substituted phenyl group represented by the 
formula 
   wherein a and a' independently are hydrogen, 
halogen, hydroxy, C₁-C₄ alkoxy, C₁-C₄ alkanoyloxy, 
C₁-C₄ alkyl, C₁-C₄ alkylthio, amino, C₁-C₄ 
alkan
