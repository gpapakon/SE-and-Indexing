<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of Ipriflavone 
(7-isopropoxyisoflavone) and combinations thereof with 

porous hydroxylapatite and/or tricalcium phosphate for the 
substitution of bone defects having pathologically developed 

or being artificially established, as well as to 
compositions containing these active ingredients and their 

preparation. 
In the combinations of the invention, the mass ratio A/B of 
porous hydroxylapatite and/or tricalcium phosphate (A) to 

Ipriflavone (B) is preferably 1:9 to 9:1 and most preferably 
1:1. The components are preferably present in the form of 

discrete granules. 
Preferably, the Ipriflavone is applied onto the surface of 
the porous hydroxylapatite and/or tricalcium phosphate. 
The compositions of the invention lead to an accelerated 
bone formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to combinations of 7-isopropoxyisoflavone
(generic name Ipriflavone) with hydroxylapatite
and/or tricalcium phosphate for the substitution of
pathologically developed or artificially established bone
defects as well as to compositions containing these combinations,
methods for their preparation, and their use.WO-A-88/05 650 discloses dental compositions which comprise
ipriflavone as anti-osteoporotic agent and an antiphlogistic
agent, such as triamcinolone. In these compositions,
ipriflavone exhibits an osteoclast-inhibiting
activity and antagonizes the osteoclast activity increasing
effects of steroidal antiphlogistics. The composltions
are provided for the treatment of caries and for
the healing of acute or chronic inflammatory lesions of
pulp, dental radix or the bone substance surrounding
them, and are formulated as dental fillers or cements,
pastes for sterilizing the pulp canal, root fillers,
coating compositions for protecting dental stumps, etc. .The problem of bone defect substitution is not mentioned
in this document.During the last decade, a demand has become more and more
pronounced to prevent the loss of teeth or groups of
teeth instead of substituting them by removable prostheses. Because of diseases of the periodontium, the alveolar walls
and thereby the mandibles atrophize after removal or loss of
a tooth or teeth being close to each other. The solid
fixation of a metal implant in atrophized, bone-deficient
jaws is problematic.In the cases of certain diseases, e.g. bone tumours, the
bone defect is artificially established by removing the
tumour tissue, or due to a bone fracture.It is known that porous hydroxylapatite (e.g. CEROS® 80) or
tricalcium phosphate (e.g. CEROS® 82), respectively, are
useful bone-substitutive materials in dentistry and
maxillary surgery. The drawback of this method consists in
that after filling the bone-defective region with a porous
hydroxylapatite or tricalcium phosphate by suitable
techniques, an amount of new bone providing a safe
implantation bed has formed only after about 20 months.Thus, it is the object of this invention to provide
combinations and compositions useful to
substitute bone defects of pathological or artificial
genesis, (e.g. due to oral (dental) surgery, removal of bone
tumours, bone fractures or the like), to accelerate the
regenerative process of bone defect-substitution carried out
with hydroxylapatite or tricalcium phosphate known in the
art and/or to achieve new bone material adapted to the
demand of locally
