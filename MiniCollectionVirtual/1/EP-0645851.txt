<ABSTRACT>
The busline connector consists of a base body (1) and a clamping cover (2) which can be latched in the base body, between which a ribbon cable (3) can be clamped in, the individual cable cores (31) of the ribbon cable being made contact with via insulation-piercing terminal zones (41) on contact elements (4) of the base body. The base body has a ribbon cable holder (12) which is of U-shaped design and has side arms (13) between which the clamping cover (2), which is likewise U-shaped, can be locked by means of latching ribs (22) and latching tabs (23) to latching grooves (15) and latching hooks (16).In addition, spikes (19) are integrally formed on the base body between the respective insulation-piercing terminal zones (41), which spikes (19) cut through the insulating webs (33) of the ribbon cable between the cable cores and likewise latch in recesses in the cover. The design of the plug parts, which latch into one another, results in a very high resistance moment with respect to tensile forces on the ribbon cable, so that a busline which is fitted with these connectors is very durable, it also being possible to draw the connectors out of a socket, if required, via the ribbon cable.

Bus line connector having the following features: 

a prescribed number of plug-in contact elements (4) 
corresponding to the number of the conducting wires (31) 

of a ribbon cable (3) to be contacted are anchored in a 
basic body (1) made from insulating material, 
the basic body (1) forms at one end a ribbon cable 
receptacle (12) in which each contact element (4) forms 

at least one insulation displacement connector zone (41) 
in an arrangement offset in accordance with the wire 

spacing of the ribbon cable (3), and 
a terminal cover (2) having cutouts (28) in accordance 
with the insulation displacement connector zones (41) can 

be plugged onto the latter and has on both sides of the 
ribbon cable receptacle (12) latching elements (22, 23) 

which engage with corresponding latching elements (15, 
16) of the basic body (1) when the cover (2) is mounted 

with the interposition of the ribbon cable (3) and lock 
the cover on the basic body, 
 
characterized by the following additional features: 


the ribbon cable receptacle (12) of the basic body has 
side walls (13) which guide the ribbon cable (3) on both 

sides and enclose the mounted terminal cover (2) on both 
sides at least predominantly, and 
the side walls (13) of the ribbon cable receptacle 
respectively inherently have a U-profile with inwardly 

pointing side limbs (14), in each case one locating 
groove (15), which extends between the side limbs (14), 

cooperating with a locating rib (22) of the terminal 
cover (2) in order to lock the latter over the ribbon 

cable (3). 
Connector according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that there is integrally formed on the basic body (1) or 

on the cover (2) in the region of the ribbon cable 
receptacle (12) at least one retaining lance (19) 

directed at right angles to the cable plane which penetrates 
the insulating web (33) of the ribbon cable (3) 

between in each case two wires (31) and latches with a 
hook-shaped end (19a) in an undercut cutout (24, 25) of 

the cover (2) or of the basic body. 
Connector according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a retaining lance (19) is provided in the edge 

regions of the ribbon cable receptacle (12), in each case 
in the longitudinal direction of the cable in front of 

and behind the insulation displacement connector zones 
(41) between in each case two insulation displacement 

connector zones (41) receiving the ribbon cable wires 
(31), and the retaining lance 
(19) can be latched in the 
cover (2) with its hook-shaped end (19a). 
Connector according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that additional latching hooks (16), 

which engage with latching noses (23) of the cover in the 
region of the outer edges, are integrally formed on the 

limbs (14), projecting inwards towards the ribbon cable 
receptacle (12), of the side walls (13). 
Connector according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the cover (2) has guide arms (26) 

which guide on both sides of the ribbon cable (3) and are 
guided in the U-shaped side walls (13) of the ribbon 

cable receptacle (12). 
Connector according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the side walls (13) of the ribbon 

cable receptacle (12) overreach with their side limbs 
(14) the level of the insulation displacement connector 

zones (41) of the contact elements and, possibly, that of 
the retaining lances (19). 
Connector according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that windows (17) respectively aligned 

with the locating groove (15) are integrally formed in  
 

the side limbs (14) of the side walls (13) of the ribbon 
cable receptacle (12). 
Connector according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the side walls (13) of the ribbon 

cable receptacle (12) are thickened outwards in a V-shape 
fashion towards the free end. 
Connector according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the outer sides of the side walls 

(13) of the ribbon cable receptacle are provided with 
transverse ribs or steps (13a). 
Bus line, comprising a ribbon cable (3) which has 
a plurality of parallel conducting wires (31) mutually 

separated by insulating webs and has in its course 
between the ends at least one tap serving to make contact, 

characterized in that the tap is formed by a 
connector (10) in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 9.
