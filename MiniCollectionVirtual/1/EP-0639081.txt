<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides the use of an antigen which is a mucosally immunogenically active substance comprising the 50kD C fragment of tetanus toxin, an immunogenic fragment thereof, or a derivative thereof formed by amino acid deletion, substitution or insertion for the manufacture of a vaccine composition for administration to a mucosal surface to induce an immune response in the mucosal surface against tetanus infection. The vaccine composition preferably contains the P.69 outer membrane protein of B.pertussis, and B.pertussis filamentous haemaglutinin. The invention also provides vaccine compositions per se and a method of treating tetanus and optionally whooping cough using the vaccine compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to acellular vaccine compositions
for intranasal delivery to mucosal surfaces.More particularly, the present invention relates to acellular
intranasal vaccine compositions for inoculating a meal such as a
human against tetanus infections.It has long been the practice of clinicians to
immunise human infants against a variety of common
diseases by means of mixed vaccines which are directed
against a plurality of diseases. For example, multiple-component
vaccine compositions directed against
diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough have been available
for a considerable number of years. Such vaccines have
hitherto been administered by injection. The advantages
of multiple-component vaccines are readily apparent in 
that the patient (usually an infant) is subjected to a
much smaller number of potentially distressing injections
than would otherwise be the case.The majority of infectious diseases are initiated by
contact with a mucosal surface. The infecting agent may
remain at or within the mucous membranes during the course
of the infection or may penetrate into the body and
localise at other sites. The importance of the mucous
membranes in the first line of defence against infectious
disease can be gleaned from the fact that 90% of the
lymphocytes of the body underlie such surfaces. Priming
mucosal surfaces by immunisation so that they respond
vigorously and effectively control pathogenic organisms
they encounter would be advantageous. Unfortunately
traditional immunisation regimes are ineffective at
eliciting mucosal responses. The systemic and local
(mucosal) immune systems appear to be compartmentalised
and in general do not impinge on one another; that is
parenteral immunisation with non-living vaccines
stimulates mucosal immune responses weakly if at all.
Mucosal immunisation (oral or intranasal) can evoke serum
antibodies but thin is usually less effective than
parenteral immunisation. The immunocytes of the different
mucous membranes form a vast intercommunicating network,
termed the common mucosal immune system, such that topical
immunisation of one surface (e.g. the gastrointestinal
tract) may lead to an immune response at that surface and
also distance surfaces such as the respiratory tract. EP-A-0209281 suggests that vaccine compositions
including a tetanus toxin protein or peptide can be
administered orally, but the Examples in this document only
relate to administration by injection.International Application WO-A-9015871 discloses a
process for the production of

<CLAIMS>
The use of an acellular antigen, (hereinafter
referred to as "(a)"), which is a mucosally

immunogenically active substance comprising the 50kD
C fragment of tetanus toxin, an immunogenic fragment

thereof, or a derivative thereof formed by amino
acid deletion, substitution or insertion for the

manufacture of an acellular vaccine composition for
intranasal administration to a mucosal surface to

induce an immune response in the mucosal surface
against tetanus infection.
An acellular vaccine composition in a form adapted
for intranasal application to a mucosal surface, the

composition comprising the mucosally immunogenically
active substance (a) as defined in Claim 1, and a

pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.
A vaccine composition according to Claim 2 in the
form of a solution for administration as a nasal

spray or nasal drops.
A vaccine composition according to Claim 3 in the
form of nasal drops, said composition comprising

means for administering drops to the nasal mucosa.
