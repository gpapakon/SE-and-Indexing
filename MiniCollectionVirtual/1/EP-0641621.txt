<ABSTRACT>
The rotary drive device for the drive of the sleeve of an electrical discharge machining unit comprises an electric motor, reversible with regard to the direction of rotation, and a reduction gear unit allocated to the electric motor. This reduction gear unit has a pinion (41) and two gear wheels (33, 35) rotatably mounted relative to one another. Both the gear wheels (33, 35) mesh with the pinion (41). One of the gear wheels (35) is under the effect of a torsion preloading force. A first gear wheel (33) of the two gear wheels of the reduction gear unit is coupled to the sleeve (20, 21) in such a way as to be locked in terms of rotation, while the second gear wheel (35) is rotatable relative to the sleeve. Such a rotary drive device works with little effort in both directions of rotation absolutely free of play, any wear which may arise being automatically compensated for.

Rotary drive device for the centre sleeve (20, 
21) or the workpiece holder (22) of an erosion machine, 

with an electric motor of reversible direction of rotation, 
with a reduction gear which is assigned to the 

electric motor and which has an input member, coupled to 
the electric motor and driven by this, and an output 

member, coupled to the centre sleeve or the workpiece 
holder and driving it, with a rotary encoder (23) coupled 

to the centre sleeve or the workpiece holder and with a 
control unit connected to the rotary encoder and the 

electric motor, characterized in that the input member of 
the reduction gear comprises a pinion (41) and the output 

member of the reduction gear comprises two gearwheels 
(33, 35) which are mounted rotatably relative to one 

another and which are both in engagement with the pinion 
(41), a first (33) of the two gear wheels of the reduction 

gear being coupled fixedly in terms of rotation to 
the centre sleeve (20, 21) or workpiece holder (22), 

whilst the second gearwheel (35) is mounted on the first 
gearwheel so as to be rotatable relative to the centre 

sleeve or workpiece holder and is under the effect of at 
least one tension spring (51) which exerts a torsional 

prestressing force and which is arranged in a slot (50) 
of the first gearwheel (33), the said slot running in the 

circumferential direction of the latter, and the 
prestressing torque exerted by the spring or springs (51) 

being greater than the greatest torque to be transmitted 
by the rotary drive device. 
Rotary drive device according to Claim 1,  
 

characterized in that the angle of rotation of the 
rotational movement of the second gearwheel (35) is 

limited. 
Rotary drive device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the two gearwheels (33, 35) are provided 

with anchoring members (52, 53) projecting into the slot 
(50) and intended for the suspension of a tension spring 

(51), the anchoring member (52) of one gearwheel (33) 
being arranged at one end of the slot (50) and the 

anchoring member (53) of other gearwheel (35) being 
arranged in the region of the other end of the slot (50). 
Rotary drive device according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that four slots (50) distributed 

uniformly over the circumference and having associated 
tension springs (51) are provided.
