<ABSTRACT>
A yarn twisting spindle device comprising two spindles 
(2,6), having yarn introducing holes (24, 25) formed 

therein, respectively, and coaxially disposed in an axial 
line rotatably in opposite directions, for twisting a yarn 

passed through the introducing holes. An end (2b) of one 
(2) of the two spindles is formed in a cylindrical portion 

and has outer annular members (7a) fitted inside thereof. 
An end (6a) of the other spindle (6) is formed in a shaft 

portion (6) and has inner annular members (7b) fitted 
outside thereof. Balls (8) are disposed between both the 

annular members (7a, 7b) so as to rotatably support the two 
spindles, and a prohibiting member is disposed for 

prohibiting revolution of the balls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a yarn twisting 
spindle device for continuously imparting real twists to a 
continuously fed yarn. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to a so called yarn twisting spindle 
device comprising two spindles, having yarn introducing 
holes formed therein, respectively, and coaxially disposed 
in an axial line rotatably in opposite directions, for 
twisting a yarn passed through the yarn introducing holes. In an example of a conventional yarn twisting spindle 
device disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 
47-40100, rollers are sandwiched between a pair of upper and 
lower flat plates, and the rotation of one of the flat 
plates is transmitted to the other flat plate the flat plate 
in an opposite direction via the rollers, and the loads 
applied in an axial direction and in a direction 
perpendicular to the axial direction are supported, 
respectively, by bearings disposed separate from the flat 
plates. In yarn twisting spindle devices disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-open No. Sho 50-135347 and No. Sho 
47-33246, two spindles are supported by bearings, 
respectively, and a toothed gear or belt is disposed between 
the two spindles so that the spindles are rotated in 
opposite directions. The prior art disclosed in the above-described Japanese 
Patent Publication No. Sho 47-40100 has the following 
problems because the rollers are sandwiched between a pair 
of flat plates. 
(1) As the rotational speed of the yarn twisting 
spindle device increases, an excessive force is exerted, due 
to centrifugal force of the rollers, to the rollers and a 
regulating plate for supporting the rollers, and seizure of 
the device may occur.  (2) Lubricating oil applied to the rollers may be 
scattered due to the centrifugal force, and accordingly, 
seizure of the device may occur due to decrease of the 
lubricating oil. (3) Because both a power transmitting mechanism and 
bearings for supporting spindles are necessary, the size of 
the yarn twisting device becomes large, and ballooning of 
yarn formed during yarn twisting operation also becomes 
large in such a large sized yarn twisting spindle device, 
and operating speed of such a yarn twisting spindle device 
cannot be enhanced. (4) The upper rotatable flat plate is supported only 
via rollers, its center of rotation may be shifted or it may 
displace vertically. Accordingly, the yarn twisting spindle 
device may be easily vibrated at high speed, and therefore, 
the yarn twisting spindle device is
