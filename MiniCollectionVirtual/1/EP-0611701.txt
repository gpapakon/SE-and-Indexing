A box for components to be dispensed, notably 
for wiring accessories such as end pieces or analogous 

components, including an upper convex wall, a lower 
convex wall and at least one end wall, and a storage 

compartment for the components to be dispensed and a 
dispensing space open at the top and separated from the 

storage compartment by a flap that is capable of pivoting 
towards the inside of the compartment under the effect of 

manual pressure exerted on the sides of the box,
 
   characterised by the fact that the dispensing space 

is a chamber (A2) bounded by a second end wall (13) and 
that the upper wall (11) includes, at the end of the 

dispensing chamber (A2) that is remote from the flap (17) 
a retention facet (21) that is convex and is connected to 

the second end wall (13) to form a cradle that provides 
restraint and rigidity. 
A box according to Claim 1, characterised by 
the fact that it has side walls (15,16) of a height (h), 

provided with areas (18) for the user's fingers to press 

upon, the retention facet (21) being joined to the side 
walls.  

 
A box according to Claim 2, characterised by 
the fact that the side walls (15,16) are flat in the at-rest 

position. 
A box according to one of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised by the fact that marks (19) that display 

the location and the direction of the manual pressure are 
carried on the flap (17) and/or adjacent areas of the 

upper wall or the side walls.
