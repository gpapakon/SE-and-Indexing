<ABSTRACT>
The eddy current-rail brake magnet (1) is provided on its pole face (12), which forms its underside and is of continuous rigid construction, in the region vertically above the rail surface (4) with a transverse profile (13) which corresponds at least approximately to the profile (5) of the said rail surface (4). The transverse profile (13) is constructed here in such a way that in the operating state of the eddy current-rail brake magnet its pole face (12) and the surface (4) of the rail are located, allowing for the possibility of lateral displacement between these two faces and allowing for the largest possible curvature of the rail in bend sections of the route, opposite one another in a non-contacting arrangement at a minimum distance of approximately 5 mm with the smallest overall air gap (14) possible. For this purpose, the transverse profile (13) is expediently constructed as an envelope curve for the surface (4) of the rail allowing for the aforementioned possibility of lateral displacement and the largest possible degree of curvature of the rail. By minimising the air gap (14) by means of the transverse profile (13) a substantial increase in the braking effect of the eddy current-rail brake magnet (1) in comparison with previously customary eddy current-rail brake magnets with planar pole faces can be achieved.

curvature in curved sections with relative transverse 

motion of the rail surface (4) with respect to the
