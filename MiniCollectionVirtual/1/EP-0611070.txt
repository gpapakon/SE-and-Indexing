<ABSTRACT>
A mobile telephone has a plurality of operating 
characteristics, such as the volume of an output signal, the 

ringing volume, and the generation of tones. When moving 
from one environment to another, such as, from an indoor 

environment to an in-car environment or an out-door 
environment, it is preferable to modify a plurality of these 

operating characteristics. 
In order to facilitate the modification of said 
plurality of characteristics, a plurality of groups (2-7) 

are defined for these characteristics. Each group includes 
predetermined values for all these characteristics and the 

selection of a particular group results in a plurality of 
characteristics being modified simultaneously. Thus, when 

moving from one environment to another, a user is only 
required to make a single menu selection, resulting in a 

plurality of operating characteristics being modified 
simultaneously. For example, when moving into an in-car 

environment, the output volume will be increased, ringing 
tone volume will be increased and a call transfer function, 

if previously selected, will be disabled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile
telephone, of the type having a plurality of operating
characteristics and means for adjusting said operating
characteristics.Mobile telephones tend to have significantly more
adjustable characteristics than conventional telephones.
For example, known mobile telephones include means for
adjusting the sound volume so as to accommodate variations
in ambient noise and the operating environment. Thus, when
speaking in a car, a higher sound volume is generally used
than in, say, a theatre or when in a conference.Known mobile telephones also make provision for
adjusting the ringing volume, again, in accordance with the
situation of the user. Outdoors, for example, the ringing
volume can be adjusted to its maximum, whereas indoors a
lower ringing intensity may be preferred. Furthermore, in
a theatre or when in a conference, it may be preferable to
switch off the ringer altogether.In addition to the characteristics which can be
controlled over a range of values, mobile telephones are
also known which have characteristics which may be switched
on or switched off. Examples of these characteristics
include whether a tone is heard when a key is pressed,
whether warning tones are generated, whether the telephone's 
lights are switched on and whether calls are automatically
transferred, etc.In known mobile telephones, it is necessary for a
user to adjust each individual characteristic when moving
from one environment to another such as, for example, when
coming out of a meeting or when going outdoors etc. Thus,
under these situations, it is necessary for a user to
identify each individual characteristic and make suitable
adjustments. Usually, this involves selecting
characteristics from a menu, adjusting the characteristic
selected from the menu and then resetting the telephone to
its normal operating mode.Consequently, it is tedious for an operator to
adjust a plurality of characteristics and there is a
tendency for characteristics not to be placed into their
ideal setting when the telephone is moved from one
environment to another. Thus, although the ability to make
the appropriate adjustment is provided by the device
itself, these adjustments are often not made, resulting in
the telephone not offering the best possible performance
for each situation within which it is placed.WO 90/04841 (Motorola Inc) describes a radio having
adjustable operating parameters, which may be adjusted
based on the occurrence of one or more predetermined
events. The events and the related
