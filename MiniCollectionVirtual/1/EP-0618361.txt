<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for compressing a gaseous medium, especially air, which involves compressing a gas, which has been drawn in by a compressor driven by the output side of a heat engine (heat motor), from a low initial pressure to a predefined end pressure and heating it, prior to delivery to the places of consumption, by means of a heat exchanger, utilising the thermal energy of the heat engine. In order to produce a relatively dry gas and to be able to dispense with an elaborate monitoring system, it is proposed that there be applied to the heat exchanger the thermal energy of the lubricating oil circuit and/or cooling circuit of the heat engine. In this arrangement there are provided, between the heat exchanger (65) and the heat engine (20), connection lines (73, 74) which form part of the lubricating and/or cooling circuit of the heat engine (20).

A method for compressing a gaseous medium, in 
particular air, in which gas drawn in by means of a 

compressor (40, 40') driven by the useful side of a 
thermal engine (20) is compressed from a low starting 

pressure, in particular atmospheric pressure, to a 
final pressure preset in a pressure vessel (50, 55), 

and after removal from the pressure vessel and before 
being delivered to the consumption points (53) is 

heated using the thermal energy of the thermal engine 
by means of a heat exchanger (65),
 
characterised in that in order to produce a gas having 

a low relative moisture content the heat exchanger is 
acted upon by the thermal energy of a liquid, namely 

that of the lubricant and/or cooling circuit of the 
thermal engine. 
An apparatus for performing the method according 
to Claim 1, comprising a compressor (40, 40') which is 

connected to the useful side of a thermal engine (20) 
and the pressure joint of which is connected via a line 

to a pressure vessel and a subsequent heat exchanger to 
the consumption points (53) and the heat exchanger (65) 

is connected thermally via a line to the thermal 
engine,
 
characterised in that the connecting lines (73, 74) 

between the liquid/gas heat exchanger (65) and the 
thermal engine (20) are part of the lubricating and/or 

cooling circuit of the thermal engine (20). 
A method for compressing a gaseous medium, in 
particular air, in which gas drawn in by means of a 

liquid-cooled compressor (40) driven by the useful side 
of a drive unit (30) is compressed from a low starting 

pressure, in particular atmospheric pressure, to a  
 

predetermined final pressure, and is heated before 
being delivered to the consumption points (53), the 

heating being preceded by subsequent cooling of the 
compressed gas and the liquid separated off in the 

separator (55) is recycled to the compressor (40) and 
is cooled before injection into the compressor (40),
 
characterised in that the cooled, compressed gas is 

acted upon by the thermal energy of a liquid, namely 
the liquid recycled from the separator (55). 
An apparatus for performing the method according 
to Claim 3, comprising a liquid-cooled compressor (40) 

which is connected to the useful side of a drive unit 
(30) and the pressure joint of which is connected via a 

line to a separator (55) and the liquid sump of the 
separator is connected to the compressor (40) via a 

recycling line (15, 16, 17, 18), in which a filter (41) 
and a cooler (44) are located, and a cooler (60) and a 

condensate separator (61) and a heat exchanger (42) are 
arranged between the separator (55) and the consumption 

points (53),
 
characterised in that the liquid/gas heat exchanger 

(42) is located in the recycling line (16, 17) between 
the filter (41) and subsequent cooler (44).
