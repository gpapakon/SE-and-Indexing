<ABSTRACT>
A step (18) for a passenger conveying device is 
provided, comprising a tread portion (44), a riser 

portion (46), and a plurality of blocking members (62). 
The tread portion includes a width (48), a length (50), 

and a pair of end faces (52) extending along its width. 
Each of the tread portion end faces includes a slot 

(60). The blocking members (62) are received within the 
slots.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to passenger conveyor device 
steps in general, and to escalator steps in particular. Escalators and other passenger conveying devices 
typically include a frame, a drive, a pair of 
balustrades, a step chain, and a plurality of steps 
attached to the step chain. The frame comprises a truss 
section on both the left and right hand sides of the 
frame. In the case of an escalator each truss section 
has two end sections parallel to one another, connected 
by an inclined midsection. The end sections form 
landings at the two elevations connected by the 
midsection, one on each end. Matching pairs of roller 
tracks are attached on the inside of each truss section, 
i.e. the side of the truss section facing the other 
truss section. The balustrades, comprising handrails, 
skirt panels, and balustrade panels, are attached to the 
truss sections as is known in the art. The step chain consists of a pair of chain strands, 
a plurality of rollers, and a plurality of connecting 
axles for connecting the two chain strands as is known 
in the art. The step chain is driven by the drive, 
typically through a sprocket assembly, along a 
circuitous path. The path is defined by the roller 
tracks extending between the first and second landings. The plurality of steps attach to the connecting 
axles of the step chain. Each step comprises a tread 
portion and a riser portion. The tread portion 
comprises a width, a length, and a pair of end faces 
extending along the width of the tread portion. The 
riser section comprises a width, a length, and a pair of 
end faces extending along the width of the riser 
section. In the exposed portion of the step chain path, the  
 
steps travel from one landing to the other roughly 
centered between the skirt panels of the balustrades. A 
person of skill in the art will recognize that it is 
necessary to have a clearance space between the end 
faces of each step and the adjacent skirt panel. A 
person of skill in the art will also recognise that 
these clearance spaces present potential pinch points 
where foreign objects such as clothing and shoe heels 
can become lodged. To prevent such an occurrence, it is 
known in the art to adhere a brush to the end faces of a 
step. One difficulty with that solution is that the 
brushes typically break free in a short period of time. 
Another difficulty is the task of adhering the brushes 
to the step end faces. Viewed from one aspect the present invention 
provides a step for a passenger conveying device such as 
an

A step (18) for a passenger conveying device such 
as an escalator, comprising a tread portion (44) having 

a width (48), a length (50), and a pair of end faces 
(52) extending along said width of said tread portion, 

each of said end faces including a slot (60), a riser 
portion (46) attached to said tread portion along said 

length of said tread portion, and a plurality of 
blocking members (62), each of said slots in said tread 

portion end faces receiving one of said blocking 
members. 
A step according to claim 1, wherein said riser 
portion (46) has a width (54), a length (50), and a pair 

of end faces (58) extending along said width of said 
riser portion, each of said end faces including a slot 

(64) receiving one of said blocking members (62). 
A step according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
slots (60,64) and said blocking members (62) comprise 

mating male and female geometries. 
A step according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
each said blocking member comprises a brush (63) having 

a plurality of bristles (66) and a shank (68), said 
shank being received within said slot (60,64). 
A step according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
each said blocking member comprises a wiper (74) having 

a blade (76) and a shank (78), said shank being received 
within said slot (60,64). 
A passenger conveying device, such as an escalator, 
comprising a frame (12), a step chain (16), a drive for 

driving said step chain in a circuitous path (42) about 
said frame, a pair of balustrades (14) attached to said 

 
frame adjacent the opposite sides of said step chain, 

and a plurality of steps (18) attached to said step 
chain, wherein each of said steps is as claimed in any 

of claims 1 to 5, each of said blocking members (62) 
extending within clearance spaces (70) between said 

steps and said balustrades whereby to prevent foreign 
objects from entering therebetween.
