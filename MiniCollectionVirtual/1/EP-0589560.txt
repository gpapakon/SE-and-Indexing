<ABSTRACT>
An electrical overstress protection apparatus and 
method includes the provision of an overstress element 

(22) comprised of a lamination including a conducting 
ground path (26) and a dielectric sheet (30) engaging 

discrete signal paths (16) connected to contacts (44), 
the sheet (30) containing holes (32) or pores or thread 

or fiber interstices filled with an electrical 
overstress protection material with the sheet 

thickness and hole area in conjunction with area of 
signal and ground paths and characteristics of the 

material adapted to provide breakdown and clamping 
voltages via a path to ground from signal contacts to 

ground to protect components from excessive voltage 
levels. Electrical connectors (40) incorporate 

the apparatus in different embodiments of housing 
(42) and contact (44) configurations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical overstress 
protection apparatus for protecting voltage 
sensitive components. Miniaturization of electronic components, such as 
integrated circuits, finds extremely small conductive 
traces spaced on close centers to make such components 
vulnerable to voltage spikes or transients that 
represent overvoltages present in the signals 
transmitted to such components. Excessive voltages 
cause overstress to such components and result in damage 
or destruction, and a resulting failure of function. 
Excessive voltages come in many forms caused from many 
sources ranging from electrostatic build-up that can 
exceed 15,000 volts to induced voltages caused by 
lightning strike or an accidental engagement with a high 
voltage line. US-A-4,726,638 granted 
February 23, 1988 is drawn to a transient suppression 
assembly wherein bi-directional diodes are incorporated 
into an electrical connector, the diodes having voltage 
breakdown characteristics to shunt excessive voltage 
levels to ground circuits associated with such 
connector. As will be discerned from such patent, the 
addition of diodes and the necessary substrates 
associated therewith, disadvantageously takes up space 
inside the connector and requires the handling of a 
number of discrete components such as the diodes. In US-A-4,726,991 granted February 23, 
1988, an electrical overstress protection material is 
disclosed comprised of a matrix formed of a mixture of 
conductive and semi-conductive particles coated with 
insulating material to provide chains within the matrix 
which act in the presence of excessive voltage to 
conduct the unwanted voltage levels to ground and to 
clamp the related circuits at a given lower voltage.  
 
US-A-4 977 357 is drawn to a further overvoltage protection 
material and to an over voltage protection device that 
allows very small dimensional structures to be used in 
component overvoltage and overstress protection. The present invention has as an object an improvement 
over prior art overvoltage protection devices that allows a 
simplification of structure, particularly for multi-contact 
connectors or circuits. The invention has as a further 
object an improved overvoltage protection apparatus that 
provides, in a single structure, an integrated overvoltage 
protection applicable to multiple contacts in relation to a 
use in connectors or circuits. The present invention consists in the combination 
defined in claim 1. There is disclosed herein apparatus that features 
a use
