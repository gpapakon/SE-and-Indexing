<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for 
positioning tooling (82) with respect to a curvilinear 

workpiece (14) which 
is curved in a first direction extending along a plane substantially 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the workpiece 
and which is curved in a second direction extending along a plane 

to the workpiece longitudinal axis, the degree of curvature in 
the first direction being greater than the degree of curvature in 

the second direction. An illustrative example is automatic 
drilling, inserting and upsetting one or two piece fasteners such 

as exterior skin rivets on an airplane fuselage. Inner and outer 
po
sitioning systems (10,12) carry or support inner and outer tooling, 
respectively, which engage the workpiece from opposite sides 

thereof during tooling operations thereon. Each of the inner and 
outer positioning systems move the respective tooling through a 

large number of axes, for example six axes of movement provided 
by the outer positioning system and seven axes of movement provided 

by the inner positioning system. Movements of the inner 
and outer positioning systems are controlled and co-ordinated by 

an adaptive, master-slave control system. A lateral transfer system 
(580) enables the appratus to operate successively on a plurality 

of workpieces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of positioning tooling 
with respect to a workpiece, and more particularly to a new and 
improved method and apparatus for positioning tooling with 
respect to a curvilinear workpiece. One area of use of the present invention is positioning 
tooling in the form of drilling and riveting tools with respect 
to a curvilinear workpiece in the form of an aircraft fuselage 
section, although the principles of the present invention can be 
variously applied. In the manufacture of aircraft, various systems 
have been utilized for assembling large curvilinear and 
cylindrical parts. Traditional manufacture has involved enormous 
manual effort and extensive fixturing of parts. Of particular 
interest in the area of use of the present invention are the skin 
lap splices and butt splices which are attached during a major 
join of an aircraft fuselage. These areas are inaccessable to 
conventional C-frame automatic fastening machines, and heretofore 
fasteners have been installed by manual methods. It would, therefore, be highly desirable to provide a new 
and improved method and apparatus for positioning tooling with 
respect to a curvilinear workpiece and having application to 
automatically drilling, inserting and upsetting one or two-piece 
fasteners, for example exterior skin rivets on an airplane fuselage. It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention to provide 
a new and improved method and appratus for positioning 
tooling with respect to a curvilinear workpiece. It is a further object of this invention to provide such a  
 
method and apparatus for positioning tooling with respect to a 
curvilinear workpiece which is curved in a first direction 
extending along a plane substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal 
axis of the workpiece and which is curved in a second 
direction extending in a plane substantially parallel to the 
workpiece longitudinal axis, wherein the degree of curvature in 
the first direction is greater than the degree of curvature in 
the second direction. It is a more particular object of this invention to provide 
such a method and apparatus having application to automatic 
drilling, inserting and upsetting one or two piece fasteners such 
as exterior skin rivets on an airplane fuselage. It is a further object of this invention to provide such a 
method and apparatus having inner and outer positioning systems 
each providing movement of tooling through a relatively large 
number of axes. It is a more particular object of this invention to

workpiece being arranged in spaced relation with the longitudinal 
axes thereof in substantially parallel relation, said workpiece 

having open ends facing in the same directions, said sytem 
comprising: 


a) frame means extending about said workpiece in a direction 
substantially perpendicular to said longitudinal 

axis and carrying an outer positioning system 
containing tooling, said frame means being longitudinally 

movable relative to said workpiece; 
b) an inner positioning system supported for movement 
within said workpiece and longitudinally thereof; and 
c) lateral transfer means movable at substantially a right 
angle to said longitudinal axes of said workpieces 

along a path adjacent the open ends of said workpieces 
for receiving and supporting said frame means and said 

inner positioning system so that when tooling 
operations are completed on one of said workpieces said 

 
frame means and said inner positioning system can be 

moved longitudinally from said one workpiece onto said 
laterial transfer means for movement along said path to 

another of said workpiece whereupon said frame means 
and said inner positioning system are moved from said 

lateral transfer means longitudinally relative to said 
another workpiece for operation thereon. 
A system according to claim 64, wherein said lateral transfer 
means includes a surface provided with first track means for 

supporting said inner positioning system, said first and second 
track means being in substantially mutually parallel relation 

with said first track means being located outwardly of said second 
track means, said first and second track means being disposed 

at substantially right angles to said path of movement of said 
lateral transfer means. 
A system according to claim 64, wherein said lateral transfer 
means comprises a wheeled vehicle movable along said path on 

track means supported adjacent the open ends of said workpieces 
and drive means for moving said vehicle in two directions along 

said path.
