<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to nerve
electrodes, and more particularly to a claw-like electrode
assembly or array which is implemented for ease of implantation
on and electrical stimulation of a nerve of the patient.U.S. Patent 4,573,481 ("the '481 patent") discloses
an implantable helical electrode assembly in which the
configuration is composed of one or more flexible ribbon
electrodes each partially embedded in a portion of the
peripheral surface of a helically formed dielectric support
matrix adapted to be threaded around a selected nerve or
nerve bundle during surgical implantation of the electrode
assembly. The resiliency of the assembly allows it to expand
in the event of swelling of the nerve. The electrode
assembly is utilized to electrically trigger or measure an
action potential or to block conduction in nerve tissue.Such a helical electrode has been found somewhat
difficult to mount on the patient's nerve during implantation,
because it is necessary to unravel the helical configuration
and then reform it about the nerve. An improvement
over the '481 patent electrode design is disclosed in U.S.
Patent 4,920,979 to the same inventor, in which a flexible
electrode-supporting matrix has two oppositely directed
helical portions which are centrally joined and have free
outer ends. The helical portions extend circumferentially at
least one turn and up to as much as about two turns. A thin,
flexible conductive ribbon is secured to the inner surface to
provide multiple electrodes on one or both portions, with a
connecting electrical cable to couple the electrode array to
an electronics package implanted elsewhere in the body.The central passage through the two oppositely
directed helical portions accommodates a pair of pins which
extend at an acute angle from the respective closed legs of
a tweezer-like installation tool. When the pins are inserted
through the central passage and the legs of the tweezers are 
opened, the helical portions are distorted and spread open so
that the assembly can be slipped over the nerve with the two
open-sided portions restrained in a direction generally
perpendicular to the length of the nerve. When released by
withdrawing the pins of the installation tool, the two end
portions return to a helical shape to encircle the nerve with
their electrode portions conductively contacting the nerve
surface. This type of electrode assembly simplifies installation
of the electrode and reduces trauma to the nerve
during implantation.In US-A-5 251 634

<CLAIMS>
An electrode assembly for implantation on a nerve of a
patient, comprising resilient electrically insulative means

(12, 13, 15) for retaining the electrode assembly on the
nerve, having an Y-shaped configuration in a spread-open

condition of the resilient electrically insulative means
with a first leg (15) having a longitudinal axis of symmetry (29) and

second (12) and third legs (13) connected to said first leg at one
end thereof and extending from the connection (22) at opposite

sides of said axis of symmetry in a direction substantially
opposite to the direction of the first leg, said second and

third legs diverging from each other at said connection on
opposite sides of said axis of symmetry,


said insulative means having a cylindrical configuration in
a relaxed state with inside and outside surfaces and an

axis normal to said axis of symmetry, so that the three
legs will at least partly encircle the nerve from opposite

directions for retention thereabout after implantation, and
electrically conductive means (17) secured to at least one
of the legs at the inside surface of the cylindrical

configuration as an electrode for electrical interaction
with the nerve.
An electrode assembly according to claim 1, comprising:

two Y-shaped means for retaining the electrode assembly and
a flexible electrode (17) secured to the inside of at
least one of the legs of the Y, whereby the three legs hold

the electrode on a nerve which substantially shares a
common axis for the two Y-shaped means

for stimulation of the nerve when the electrode
is electrically energized; and
an elongate strip (27) connecting the two Y-shaped means at
the respective connections of the three legs thereof at

opposite ends of the strip, with the two Y-shaped means
oppositely directed from the strip substantially normal

thereto about said common axis and separated from each
other solely by the connecting strip and empty space.
An electrode assembly according to claim 2, further
including


at least one electrically conductive lead electrically
connected to said electrode of one of said two Y-shaped

means and running along said strip.
An electrode assembly according to claim 3, wherein

a second electrically conductive lead is electrically
connected to the electrode of the other of the two Y-shaped

means to form a bipolar electrode array.
An electrode assembly according to claim 1, wherein

said insulative means is substantially flat material, and
said electrically conductive means is a foil secured to

said inside surface of the cylindrical configuration.
An electrode assembly according to claim 5, further
including an electrical lead connected to said foil to

carry electrical signals to or from said foil, or from the
nerve on which the electrode assembly is implanted.
An electrode assembly according to claim 6, further
including an electrically insulative strip connected at one

end to said connection of the first leg.
