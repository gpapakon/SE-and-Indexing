<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hollow-panel structure on or against beams (B), over which a wooden board or a concrete floor is provided. The purpose of the invention is the production of these elements, it being possible for the surface finish-machining to be carried out in wood as well as in concrete. The hollow-panel elements are distinguished in that, by way of the mutually opposite clearances (D), connection openings (OP) result in the panels. Said connection or bearing openings (OP) ensure, over the entire surface, a sufficient structural thickness of the beams (B) which are located beneath or behind and are wholly or partially clamped into the panel (C).
