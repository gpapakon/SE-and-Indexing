<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a device by means of which a continuous paper web can be cut transversely at the highest permissible paper-transporting speed. For this purpose, in the case of a cutting machine for cutting a continuous paper web, the paper is fed via feeding means, after separating off the feed-hole strips, to a transverse-cutter arrangement having a non-driven, bottom cutter (6) and a driven, top cutter (5), a linear motor being used as drive for the top cutter. The stator is fastened on the carrier (4) and the rotor magnet (7a) is integrated in the blade.

<CLAIMS>
Device for cutting continuous paper which has a 
transport perforation and, after the severing of the 

transport perforation strips, is fed via a feeding means 
to a transverse knife arrangement (5, 6) which belongs to 

the device and has a carrier (4), a non-driven lower 
blade (6) and a driven upper blade (5), the upper blade 

(5) being guided movably up and down on the carrier (4) 
towards the lower blade, characterized in that, as drive 

for the upper blade (5), a linear motor (7, 15) is used, 
the stator (7c) of which is fastened to the carrier (4) 

for guiding the upper blade (5), and in that the upper 
blade (5) is designed as the rotor of the linear motor 

(7, 15). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that there is at least one permanent magnet (7a) in the 

driven upper blade (5). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the at least one permanent magnet (7a) is an 

integral part of the upper blade (5). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the at least one permanent magnet (7a) is attached 

to the upper blade (5). 
Method for cutting continuous paper which has a 
transport perforation, using the device according to 

Claim 1, characterized in that the linear motor, at least 
shortly before the cutting stroke current surge in the 

exciter winding of the stator, is moved up and down with 
an oscillation having a low amplitude, and in that the 

cutting stroke current surge is triggered at the upper  
 

turning point of the oscillation or shortly thereafter. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the frequency of the oscillation is of the order of 

500 to 1500 Hz. 
Method according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the amplitude of the oscillation on the knife is 

of the order of 1 mm. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the oscillation period is in the range from 5 to 

10 ms.
