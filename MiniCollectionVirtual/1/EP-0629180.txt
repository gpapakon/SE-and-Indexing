<CLAIMS>
Use of a material comprising for 100 parts by weight of at least one non-hydrous, 
hydraulic binding agent, 2.5 to 75 parts by weight cellulosic fibres 

dispersed in the matrix formed by the setting and hardening of the binding 
agent or binding agents and which once dried has a density of between 0.15 

and 0.60 for protecting articles from impact by progressive and irreversible 
deformation. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterised in that the material comprises for 100 
parts by weight of at least one non-hydrous, hydraulic binding agent, 5 to 50 

parts by weight cellulosic fibres dispersed in the matrix formed by the 
setting and hardening of the hydraulic binding agent or binding agents and 

once dried has a density of between 0.15 to 0.60. 
Use according to Claim 2, characterised in that the material comprises for 100 
parts by weight of at least one hydraulic binding agent, 10 to 25 parts by 

weight cellulosic fibres dispersed in the matrix formed by the setting and 
hardening of the hydraulic binding agent or binding agents and once dried 

has a density of between 0.2 and 0.4. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the hydraulic 
binding agent is selected from cements such as Portland cement, 

aluminous cements or plaster. 
Use according to any one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the agent 
preventing sedimentation of the paste is selected from cellulose 

ethers such as: 

cellulosic ethers such as carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl starch, - 
methylhydroxyethyl cellulose or methylhydroxypropyl cellulose, 
polysaccharides such as guar rubber or xanthane rubber, 
polyacrylamides,  
 
thickening agents such as swelling clays or ultra-fine powders such as 
aerosols, for example. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the material 
is isotropic. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the protection 
from impact is in the form of a block obtained by association with at 

least two layers of material having different densities. 
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 7 for protecting articles from impact by 
progressive and irreversible deformation in the form of packaging articles.
