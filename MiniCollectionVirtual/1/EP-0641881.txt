<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a dispensing device suitable for enabling 
the progressive release of detergent in a machine washing 

process, comprising a hollow body (1) having a dispensing 
aperture (4) defined by a peripheral rim (3) characterized in that 

said dispensing device comprises a rigid spacing means (8) 
attached to and extending from a first point (9) on said hollow 

body to a second point (10) of attachment on said hollow body, 
wherein said spacing means projects from the plane defined 

by said rim in a direction away from the hollow body.

<DESCRIPTION>
A dispensing device suitable for effectively dispensing 
detergent product to the wash solution when used in a 
fabric machine washing process is provided. Traditionally, the washing of fabrics in an automatic 
washing machine involved adding detergent product to the 
drawer of the washing machine. At the start of the wash 
process, water would be flushed through the dispensing 
drawer, dissolving the detergent product and carrying the 
dissolved product into the drum of the washing machine, and 
into contact with the fabrics to be washed. An alternative method of introducing the detergent product 
into the wash solution is through the use of a dispensing 
device, which is charged with detergent product, and 
introduced into the drum of the washing machine, together 
with the items to be washed, before commencement of the 
wash cycle. Once the washing machine has been loaded with 
laundry, the dispensing device containing the detergent 
product is placed inside the drum of the washing machine. 
At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing 
machine, water is introduced into the drum and the drum 
periodically rotates.  The dispensing device, in general, comprises a hollow body 
of sufficient volume to contain the detergent product, and 
one or more dispensing apertures through which the 
detergent may egress during the wash cycle. The use of such 
a dispensing device in a washing process can provide 
improved wash performance. Dispensing devices of various shapes and sizes have been 
proposed for the optimization of dispensing capability. 
Examples of such devices can be found described in European 
Patent Applications EP-A-201,376, EP-A-343,069 and EP-A-343,070 
in the name of the Procter and Gamble Company, and 
EP-A-490,577 and EP-A-368,680 in the name of Unilever. One problem associated with the use of such dispensing 
devices is that detergent product may fail, in certain 
circumstances, to be dispensed effectively from the device. 
The dispensing obtained for a particular granular detergent 
product will to an extent depend on its composition, 
granular form, density and susceptibility to caking, or 
gelling amongst other factors. Residues of detergent 
product may hence remain at the end of the wash cycle in 
the dispensing device, or as unseemly residues on the 
clothing. Detergent performance in the wash process may 
also be impaired as a consequence of poor detergent 
dispensing from the dispensing device. The problem of poor dispensing may particularly be observed 
when the detergent

A dispensing device suitable for enabling the 
progressive release of detergent in a machine washing 

process, comprising a hollow body having a dispensing 
aperture defined by a peripheral rim characterized in 

that said dispensing device comprises a rigid spacing 
means attached to and extending from a first point on 

said hollow body to a second point of attachment on 
said hollow body, wherein said spacing means projects 

from the plane defined by said rim in a direction away 
from the hollow body. 
A dispensing device according to Claim 1 wherein said 
spacing means projects a maximum distance of at least 

1.0 cm from the plane defined by said rim in a 
direction away from the hollow body. 
A dispensing device according to either of Claims 1 or 
2 wherein said spacing means comprises an arched 

element. 
A dispensing device according to any of claims 1 - 3, 
wherein said spacing means is attached to and extends 

from a first point on said peripheral rim to a second 
opposing point of attachment on said peripheral rim. 
A dispensing device according to claim 4 wherein said 
dispensing aperture is essentially annular and wherein 

said spacing means extends from a point on said 
peripheral rim to a diametrically opposing point on 

said peripheral rim. 
A dispensing device according to any of claims 3 - 5 
comprising a single arched element wherein said single 

arched element is band-shaped having a width of at 
 

least 0.1d wherein d is the maximum dimension of said 
dispensing aperture and an arch height, defined by the 

maximum vertical position of said arched element from 
the plane of said dispensing aperture in the direction 

away from the hollow body of at least 0.2d. 
A dispensing device according to any of claims 3 - 5 
wherein said dispensing device comprises two arched 

elements, each attached to and extending from point on 
said rim to a second point of attachment on said rim, 

such that the orientation of the span projected by the 
first arched element is substantially perpendicular in 

direction to the orientation of the span projected by 
the second arched element. 
A dispensing device according to any of claims 3 - 5 
wherein said dispensing aperture comprises two arched 

elements, each attached to and extending from a point 
of attachment on said rim to a second point on said rim 

such that the orientation of the span projected by the 
first arched element is substantially parallel in 

direction to the orientation of the span projected by 
the second arched element. 
A dispensing device according to either of claims 7 or 
8 wherein each arched element is band-shaped having a 

width of at least 0.05d wherein d is the maximum 
dimension of said dispensing aperture and an arch 

height, defined by the maximum vertical projection of 
said arched element from the plane of said dispensing
