<ABSTRACT>
High conversion catalysts for direct decomposition of NOx were 
recommended in this invention. The primary active site of the developed 

catalysts is palladium supported on Al₂O₃ or MgAl₂O₄. The activity of the 
palladium catalysts was found to be significantly enhanced by either alloying 

the palladium with group IB metals or else being promoted by promoters, 
e.g. potassium ion, oxide of lanthanium series (Ce and Nb), or oxide of 

titanium series (Zr, Hf) metals . The catalysts developed in this invention 
have revealed the following distinguished characteristics, i.e. 


a) High catalytic activity for thermal decomposition of NO into its 
component elements at temperatures around 800
o
C. 
b) Immunization against the poison of high concentration O₂ or SO₂ in the 
feed gas. 
c) Retaining good activity during continuous tests performed at 800°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is associated with the art of producing catalysts for treating 
NOx pollutant in exhaust gas. Several processes, e.g. TWC (Three-Way-Catalyst) 
system for automobiles and SCR (Selective-Catalytic-Reduction) 
process for stationary plants have been developed for practical application 
purposes so as to reduce NOx from exhaust gases . In the TWC  
 
system, 90% of NO was removed from automobiles exhaust gases as the 
ratio of Air/Fuel was controlled to around 14.6 (the stoichiometry point). 
However, NO conversion in lean burn region (Air/Fuel > 14.6) decreased 
severely with an increase of the Air/Fuel ratio. In the SCR process, NOx 
was reduced into N2 and H2O over V2O5/TiO2 catalyst by NH3. The SCR 
process has encountered drawbacks, i. e., high facility and operational-related 
expenses, and slip of annoying NH3. In the case of a diesel-engine 
co-generation system, the conversion of NO via SCR process was found 
decreasing to 30%, as a result of V2O5/TiO2 catalyst being poisoned by a 
high concentration of O2 (5-15%) or SO2 (300-500 ppm) in the exhaust 
gas [see Catalysis Today ,10 (1991) 57]. A less complicated method for NOx removal is direct thermal 
decomposition of NO. NO is thermodynamically unstable and tends to 
decompose into its harmless components, O2 and N2, via reaction (1). 
NO ↔ 1/2 O2 + 1/2 N2 ΔG°=-86.7 kJ/mole 
Several metallic catalysts, e.g. Cu/ZSM-5 (see Japanese Pat No 03-101837), 
Ag-Co3O4 [see Chem. Lett., (1990) 1069.], Pt/Al2O3 [see Catalysis Today 
,10 (1991) 57] and Pd/MgAl2O4 [see Applied Catalysis, 65 (1990) 11] have 
been developed for catalyzing the reaction. The maximum catalytic activity 
was reported at the temperature of 500 °C (85%), 600 °C (47%), 700 °C 
(62%) and 750 °C (73%) for the respective catalysts. In each parenthesis 
percentage of the NO conversion was based on N2 formation. However the catalytic activity of these four catalysts towards NO thermal 
decomposition decreased with an increasing O2 concentration in the 
exhaust gas. For example, the N2 conversion for these catalysts was 
reduced to 2.1% (for Cu/ZSM-5), 0.7% (Pt/Al2O3), 20% (Ag-Co3O4) and 
23% (Pd/MgAl2O4) as the O2 concentration was 10%, 10%, 5% and 2.5%  
 
respectively [see Catalysis Today ,10 (1991) 57 and Applied Catalysis, 65 
(1990) 11]. Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst almost completely lost its activity in the 
presence of SO2[see Applied Catalysis.,69(1991)L15. ]. Therefore, 
commercial application of the above metallic catalysts on the reaction (1) is 
currently unavailable
