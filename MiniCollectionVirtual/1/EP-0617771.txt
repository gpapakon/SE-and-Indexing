<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in dampers.
More specifically, this invention is directed to dampers which
create forces having both a hysteretic component and a friction
component identified herein as surface effect dampers.One of the earliest patents relating to dampers employing
hysteresis damping, that is the dissipation of translational
energy by working of an elastomeric member, is U.S. patent no.
3,232,597 to Gaydecki. As a way of achieving a practical
wearlife for his damper, Gaydecki sought to eliminate or, at
least, minimize the frictional force component developed
between the elements of his damper.As described in the aboveidentified related application,
eliminating totally the friction component of damping places
severe limits upon the damper's design because a significant
potential damping force has been eliminated. The approach taken
in the aforementioned application and by Applicants herein, is to
take advantage of the damping force available while minimizing
the damage friction can produce.For certain applications, it is desirable to produce one
level of damping under certain circumstances and a second level
of damping under other circumstances. One such application is in
the area of railcar dampers. It is desirable to produce different
levels of damping force for filled railcars than for empty ones.
An increased damping force will be necessary to control the
movement of the loaded railcars.A device similar to that described herein is shown in
published European patent application 0217234 A1. That
application discloses a housing 4 which tapers down at its distal
end to afford a braking force to the piston 5. This invention provides a dual-rate surface effect
damper assembly producing a damping force having a hysteretic
component and a friction component, said damper including a
housing, a rubbee member mounted for relative movement with
respect to said housing, a first elastomeric liner section having a
first length with a first uniform inner diameter for engagement
by said rubbee to produce a first uniform surface effect damping
force, a second elastomeric liner section having a second length,
said dual-rate surface effect damper being characterized by said
second elastomeric liner section having a second smaller uniform
inner diameter for engagement by said rubbee to produce a second
larger uniform surface effect damping force.It is an important aspect of the present invention to
control the potentially damaging characteristics of the friction
damping force component of
