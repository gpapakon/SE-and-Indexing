A method of decontaminating solid substances, in particular 
earth, by multi-stage washing of pre-sieved particles, wherein washing is 

effected with hot water, saturated steam and surface active agents in a 
first purification stage, and 


washing is effected continuously with the addition of additional 
water in a second purification stage, and 
the slurry produced is dried
 
   characterised in that 
in the first purification stage, separated in accordance with the 
individual fractions, the pre-sieved particles are discontinuously 

treated in a mixer and are then transferred into a buffer container, and 
in the second purification stage the solid substances are 
separated off, 
if required a post-washing operation is effected in a screw, and 
the slurry which is separated out of the aqueous phases of the 
preceding stages is mechanically dewatered and subjected to a thermal 

drying operation. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
particles are pre-sieved to grain sizes of 0 - 2 cm, 2 to 10 cm and more 

than 10 cm. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that hot water at 
a temperature of 40° to 80°C is used in the first purification stage. 
A method according to claims 1 and 3 characterised in that hot 
water at a temperature of 50 - 60° is used. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that saturated 
steam at a temperature of 150° to 250° is used in the first purification 

stage.  
 
A method according to claims 1 and 5 characterised in that 
saturated steam at a temperature of 180 to 220°C is used. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that hot water at 
a temperature of 40° to 80°C is added in the second purification stage. 
A method according to claims 1 and 7 characterised in that hot 
water at a temperature of 50° to 60°C is added. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that water in an 
amount of 0.5 to 3 times the solid substance to be decontaminated, with 

respect to the dry substance thereof, is added in the second purification 
stage. 
A method according to claims 1 and 9 characterised in that the 
amount of water added is 1 to 2 times the solid substance to be 

decontaminated. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the thermal 
drying operation for the slurry is effected at temperatures of 200 to 

400°C. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the exhaust 
air from the slurry drying operation is passed over a biofilter. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the waste 
water from all method stages is purified by reverse osmosis. 
Apparatus for decontaminating solid substances, in particular 
earth, including: 


a loading device (10), and 
a mixing device (20) with feed devices (20) for pre-sieved 
particles, water and saturated steam, characterised by:  

 
a discontinuously operating counter-flow mixer with two oppositely 
extending spirals (22, 24) and a nozzle system (26) or a double-shaft 

trough mixer for the introduction of water, steam and additives as the 
mixing device (20); 
a buffer container (30) with conveyor device (32); and 
a washing drum (40); 
 
   wherein the individual units are connected in succession in the 

specified sequence in the material flow direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 14 characterised in that it 
includes a dewatering screw (50) connected downstream of the washing drum 

(40). 
Apparatus according to claim 14 characterised in that a trough 
which is provided with a scraper chain conveyor serves as the buffer 

container (30). 
Apparatus according to claim 14 characterised in that a 
counter-flow washing drum serves as the washing drum (40).
