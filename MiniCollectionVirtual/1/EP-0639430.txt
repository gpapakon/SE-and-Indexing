<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve a clamping device, in particular for the clamping of workpieces on a machine table, comprising a housing which can be fixed on a bearing surface of a support by means of an anchoring element, a clamping element which is movable with respect to the housing and has a clamping arm projecting away from the housing, as well as a clamping spindle which is rotatably mounted on the housing and by which the clamping element is movable, in such a way that the housing can be fixed on the bearing surface in the simplest way possible, it is proposed that a firm-clamping part which is supported on the housing and is intended for the fixing of the housing relative to it is movable from a first position into a second position, that in the first position the housing is detachable from the bearing surface and that in the second position the firm-clamping part fixes the housing on the bearing surface by acting upon the anchoring element with a firm-clamping force.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping device, in particular, for clamping workpieces
on a machine table, comprising a housing (10) securable

in position on a support surface (102) of a carrier
(38) by means of an anchoring element (104), a clamping

element movable relative to the housing (10) and having
a clamping arm (30) projecting from the housing (10)

and a clamping spindle (46) rotatably mounted on the
housing (10) for moving the clamping element (30), a

fastening element (120) supported on the housing (10)
and movable relative to the carrier from a first

position into a second position for securing the
housing (10) in position, the housing (10) being

detachable from the support surface (102) in the first
position, and the fastening element (120) securing the

housing (10) in position on the support surface (102)
in the second position by acting on the anchoring

element (104) with a fastening force (186),
characterized in that the fastening element (120) is

movable by the clamping spindle (46) from the first
into the second position, and in that the fastening

element (120) is securable in the second position by a
holding element (146). 
Clamping device as defined in claim 1, characterized in
that the fastening element (120) comprises an elastic

biasing means which is adapted to be brought into a
tensioned state when the fastening element (120) is

moved from the first position into the second position.
Clamping device as defined in one of claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that in the second position the

fastening element (120) acts on the anchoring element
(104) with a fastening force (186) directed away from

the support surface (102).
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the second position

the fastening element (120) acts on a head (108) of the
anchoring element (104).
Clamping device as defined in claim 4, characterized in
that in the second position the fastening element (120)

acts on the head (108) in a direction pointing away
from a base portion (12) of the housing (10).
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fastening element

(120) is supported on the base portion (12) of the
housing (10).
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fastening element

comprises a tiltable fastening lever (120). 
Clamping device as defined in claim 7, characterized in
that the fastening element comprises a rocker (120)

tiltable about a tilt axis (122).
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fastening element

(120) is actuatable from a region (103) located outside
a front region (105) of the housing (10).
Clamping device as defined in claim 9, characterized in
that the fastening element (120) is actuatable from a

rear region (103) of the housing (10).
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fastening element

(120) is moveable from the first into the second
position by an axial displacement of the clamping

spindle (46) relative to the housing (10).
Clamping device as defined in claim 11, characterized
in that the fastening element (120) is movable from the

first into the second position by an axial bearing (52)
of the clamping spindle (46), said axial bearing being

guided for movement in the housing (10).
Clamping device as defined in claim 11 or 12,
characterized in that the fastening element (120) is

adapted to be brought from the first into the second
position via a displacement of the clamping spindle

(46) when movement of the clamping element (16) is
blocked. 
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fastening element

(120) is securable in the second position by the
holding element (146) by positive connection.
Clamping device as defined in claim 14, characterized
in that the holding element is designed as a locking

element (146).
Clamping device as defined in claim 15, characterized
in that the locking element (146) abuts in its locking

position on a locking surface (140) of the fastening
element (120).
Clamping device as defined in claim 15 or 16,
characterized in that the locking element (146) is

biased in the direction of its locking position.
Clamping device as defined in claim 17, characterized
in that the locking element (146) is movable out of its

locking position by actuation of an actuating element
(154, 198).
Clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the holding element (146)
