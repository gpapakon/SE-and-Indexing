<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a lubricating oil composition in 
which a lubricating oil base contains 0.1% by weight to 20% by 

weight of an aromatic glycidyl carboxylate having the 
following general formula (1): 


wherein R is a C₆₋₁₄ aryl or alkylaryl group, and n represents 
an integer of 1 or 2, and/or 0.05% by weight to 10% by weight 

of a phosphonate type additive having the following general 
formula (2): 


wherein R₁ or R₂ is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, 
aralkyl, aryl and hydroxyalkyl groups that may or may not have 

a substitute, and two R₂ groups may be identical with or 
different from each other, and which is excellent in stability 

to hydrolysis, heat and oxidation as well as in lubricating 
properties, and so provides a particularly excellent 

refrigerating oil composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a lubricating
oil composition that is represented by refrigerating machine
lubricating oil, viscous coupling lubricating oil, gear oil,
mechanical booster pump oil, shock absorber oil, turbo-molecular
pump bearing oil and belt tensioner oil and is excellent in
stability to hydrolysis, heat and oxidation as well as in
lubricating properties and, more particularly, to a
refrigerating machine lubricating oil composition that is
excellent in stability to hydrolysis, heat and oxidation as
well as in lubricating properties, and is well compatible with
a non-chlorine type of fluorine-containing refrigerant.So far, chlorine-containing refrigerants such as R11
(CCl3F), R12 (CCl2F2), R123 (CF3CHCl2) and R22 (CHClF2) have
been used as refrigerants for refrigerating machinery. In
recent years in which the development of substitute flon is in
urgent need in view of environmental problems, however, non-chlorine
type fluorine-containing refrigerants such as
1.1.1.2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a), difluoromethane (R32) and
1.1.2.2.2-pentafluoroethane (R125) have attracted wide
attention. It has also been proposed to use as refrigerating
machine oil polyalkylene glycol or ester oils that are
compatible with these refrigerants (R134a, R32, R125, and so
on). As the efficiency of refrigerating machinery increases, 
such refrigerating machine oil is now required to have an
increased heat stability, and ester or polyalkylene glycol
oils that are excellent in stability are used to this end.
However, these ester or polyalkylene glycol oils are still
less than satisfactory, because they hydrolyze in the presence
of small amounts of water or air, or oxidize, resulting in an
increase in the acid number. Their stability increase may be
achieved by the incorporation of an epoxy compound in them,
but the resulting oils become insufficient in terms of
compatibility with refrigerants or stability, although varying
depending on the structure of epoxy.In the case of conventional chlorine-containing
refrigerants, there is no need of taking any special care of
their lubricating properties, because they possess some
lubricating properties by themselves. However, non-chlorine
type fluorine-containing refrigerants are required to be
increased in lubricating properties for lack of lubricating
properties. It has been known to incorporate a lubricant such
as tricresyl phosphate in refrigerating machine lubricating
oil, but this offers a problem that the resulting lubricating
oil fails to produce its own
