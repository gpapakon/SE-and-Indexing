<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for operating a processor-controlled system to produce from a 
first table image, upon receipt (210) of an image display request signal from a signal source, a 

second table image including focal and context cell regions having output region sizes different 
from the regions sizes of the corresponding cells in the first table image. The output region size of 

each focal cell region is determined (250) according to a "degree of interest" (DOI) function for 
each dimension of the table image that represents the level of interest of each cell region in that 

dimension. A predetermined cell size is allocated to focal cell regions, and the remaining available 
output space is allocated to the cell sizes of non-focal cell regions. Image definition data defining 

the second table image is then produced (252). For each focal cell region in the second table 
image, the source data value of a respectively paired source data item in an underlying n-dimensional 

(nD) information data array is obtained (280). Image definition data defining the 
image representation of the source data value is then produced (314) for display in the respective 

focal cell region. The second table image having focal cell regions showing source data values 
therein is then displayed (340) in the display area of a system display device. In another aspect of 

the method of the invention, graphical display objects indirectly, or graphically, representing the 
data values in the underlying data array are included in the non-focal cell regions. The graphical 

display object for each non-focal cell region is determined by a cell presentation type selected 

using the data type of the respectively paired source data item. Image definition data defining 
the graphical display object for each non-focal cell is provided to a system display device for 

display in the second table image. The underlying data in the nD data array is thus directly, or 
symbolically, represented in the focal cell regions and graphically, or indirectly, represented in the 

non-focal cell regions, facilitating both direct observation and interaction with actual data values 
and the visual inspection and identification of patterns and trends in the data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method and a system according to the preamble parts of
claims 1 and 7.Such a method and system are described in US-A-5,226,118 which will be discussed
below.A key objective of information systems designers is the presentation of information
representing data stored in the memory device of a processor-controlled system to the human user
of the system in an effective image format that conveys and enhances the understanding of the
information in a spacially efficient and effective manner, and permits the system user to quickly
and efficiently specify and locate information of particular interest.A familiar and effective information presentation form for certain types of structured
information is that of an image of a table, also referred to herein as a "table image". As used
herein, a "table" is an orderly, rectilinear arrangement of information, typically but not
necessarily, ordered in a rectangular form of rows and columns and having identifiers, such as
labels, arranged at the periphery of the table. The intersection of a row and column in a table
defines a data location, typically called a "cell", and may include alphabetic and numeric character
data or arithmetic operators or formulas. A table is distinguishable from various types of graphs
which do not have all of the characteristics of the orderly, rectilinear arrangement of information
found in a table. A popular application of a table image is the "spreadsheet", the information
presentation format used by a computer-implemented spreadsheet application program that
presents a tabular image of underlying data stored in the memory of a system, and that provides a
system user with access to the stored data via the manipulation of the character display features
that visually represent the underlying data presented in the cells of the spreadsheet. Table images
also may be used in a wide variety of application program contexts where the information
structure includes linear elements and is organized in, or is capable of being organized in; an n-dimensional
"array data structure".Baker et al. in US-A-5,226,118 discloses a data analysis computer system capable of
storing measurement data from plural measured processes and definitions for many data analysis
charts. There is further disclosed a data display gallery feature which divides the computer
system's display into a two dimensional array of cells, called a graphical spreadsheet or gallery,
having cell definitions assigned to at least a subset of the cells. Each cell
