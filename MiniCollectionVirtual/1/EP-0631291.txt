<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a decontaminating solution for tissues contaminated by silver 
<
110m
>
Ag, as well as to a process for decontaminating such a tissue using this decontaminating solution. The aim of the invention is to develop a solution and a process such as are mentioned above and which make it possible to carry out a decontamination which is effective, easy and quick to implement. This aim is achieved using an ammoniacal aqueous solution whose concentration is between 2.63 and 52.5 g/l, and in which are solubilised silver nitrate AgNO3 at a concentration of between 12 and 18 mg/l and a surfactant at a concentration of between 12 and 24 g/l.
