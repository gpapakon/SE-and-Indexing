<ABSTRACT>
The drive of a belt tensioning device is formed by a piston/cylinder arrangement (10, 14) with a traction cable (12) which is connected on the one hand to the belt lock and on the other hand to the piston (14) which is displaceably mounted in the cylinder (10). The piston (14) has a circumferential groove (22) in which two semicircular discs (18, 20) are arranged in oppositely extending obliquely positions with respect to the axis of the piston (14) supported one on the other with the circumferential ends and are held in contact at their outer circumference with the wall of the cylinder (10). During a piston movement, the semicircular discs become aligned counter to the working stroke of the piston and clamp the latter in the cylinder.

A belt pretensioner for a vehicle safety belt system 
comprising a piston and cylinder unit (10, 14), a cable (12) 

which is connected on the one hand with the buckle and on 
the other hand with the piston (14) running in the cylinder 

(10), and a return stop device (16, 18, 20, 22) which 
prevents any motion of the piston (14) opposite the 

direction (F) of pretensioning, characterized in that the 
piston (14) has a circumferential groove (22), in which two 

semi-annular disks (18, 20) are arranged with an opposite 
oblique slope in relation to the axis of the piston (14) and 

so that the circumferential ends bear against one another 
and on their outer periphery are held in contact with the 

wall surface of the cylinder (10). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 1, characterized 

in that the circumferential ends of the semi-annular 
disks (18, 20) pivotally bear against a radial limiting wall 

surface (221) of the circumferential groove (22). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the limiting wall surface (223) of the circumferential 

groove (22), which is opposite to the radial 
limiting wall surface (221), is at a slant to the axis of 

the piston (14).  
 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the slant of the limiting wall surface (223) is 

respectively the same as the slant assumed by the semi-annular 
disks (18, 20) in their opposite oblique setting in 

relation to the axis of the piston (14). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 3 or in claim 
4, characterized in that the obliquely slanting limiting 

wall surface (223) is furnished with a circumferentially 
extending step (224) in its outer periphery, in which step 

an O-ring seal (16) is accommodated, which at its outer 
periphery is in contact with the wall surface of the 

cylinder (10) and against whose side facing the radial 
limiting wall surface (221) the semi-annular disks (18, 20) 

bear in the axial direction.
