<ABSTRACT>
A clutch assembly (1) for a vehicle with selective front 
wheel drive includes an automatic oil level control 

system and comprises a housing (2) enclosing a hydraulic 
clutch (5) which, when engaged, connects a front wheel 

drive shaft (4) to a main vehicle drive shaft (3). 
Since the hydraulic clutch has a tendency to leak fluid 

into the housing, the fluid level within the housing is 
controlled by pressurizing the housing via compressed 

air from a turbocharger or the like. A pair of blow 
back tubes (51,52) extend into the housing from opposite 

sides of the housing, and are interconnected and then 
connected to an unpressurized reservoir (62), such as 

the crankcase or transmission case, via an excess oil 
evacuation line (61). The blow back tubes have open 

ports (53,54) which are positioned such that, when oil 
simultaneously covers the ports in both blow back tubes, 

excess Oil is evacuated to the connected reservoir. The 
blow back tube ports are positioned such that excess oil 

is detected and evacuated when the clutch and drive 
shaft are static or dynamically rotating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a clutch assembly including a housing
enclosing a hydraulically actuated clutch, and more particularly to such a clutch
assembly in which pressurized air from an external source is used to regulate the level
of oil within the clutch housing by returning excess oil from the housing to a fluid
reservoir, such as a vehicle transmission or crankcase.In modern agricultural tractors which include selective front wheel drive, there is
generally provided a hydraulic clutch in line with the main drive shaft. When the clutch
is disengaged, the front wheels are freely rotating, but with the clutch engaged, a front
wheel drive shaft is driven by the main drive shaft via the clutch. Such clutches are
generally a part of a clutch assembly including a housing into which the main drive
shaft and the front wheel drive shaft extend. The front wheel drive shaft then enters a
separate differential housing from which two separate front wheel axles extend.In such a clutch assembly, it is essential that the oil level within the clutch
housing be maintained at or near a predetermined level. Too little oil can, of course,
result in damage to the moving parts due to lack of lubrication. On the other hand, too
much oil can decrease the efficiency of the clutch assembly, cause cavitation of the oil,
"cook" the oil, and unduly heat the clutch assembly due to the large quantity of hot oil
it contains. Furthermore, should the housing fill with oil, upon subsequent start-up, the 
internal seals can blow out due to a sudden increase in pressure, necessitating that the
entire assembly be pulled apart for repairs.However, maintaining the proper amount of oil in such a clutch housing is
difficult due to the fact that hydraulically driven clutches tend to leak fluid about their
seals, which fluid necessarily accumulates within the clutch housing, thus raising the oil
level therein.One known method of maintaining the proper level of oil in a differential axle
housing has been to provide elastomeric, zero leak sealing rings at the interface between
the differential clutch and the differential output shafts. This approach is reflected in
U.S. Patent No. 3,913,414 to Freiburger, but this solution has proven to be very
expensive and imperfect since the elastomeric seals themselves tend to wear over time
and thereby develop leaks.Another known system for maintaining the proper amount of oil in a differential
axle housing is that taught by U.S. Patent No. 4,529,061 to Glasrud et al., hereinafter
the '061
