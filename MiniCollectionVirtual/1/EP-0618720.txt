<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for reducing bloom in output of 
a charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor is disclosed. The 

method includes the step of toggling at least two phases of said 
CCD after exposure of said CCD. The method and apparatus are 

particularly useful when a flash of light occurs during the 
exposure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods 
for operating charge coupled device (CCD) image sensors generally 
and to methods of implementing anti-blooming in particular. As is known in the art, the image sensors smear bright 
spots, in a process known as "blooming". The excessive illumination 
at the bright spots causes a local excessive generation of 
image charge in a few elements of the CCD image sensor. The 
excessive generation often spreads to neighboring, less illuminated 
and less charged CCD elements, which spreading of charge 
results in blooming. In the past, blooming was reduced by changing the 
structure of the CCD elements. One such structure is described in 
detail in U.S. Patent 5,122,850 to Burkey. However, these structures 
are complicated, costly and reduce quantum efficiency. A method of anti-blooming has been developed which 
involves toggling the phases of the CCD image sensor during 
exposure. It is briefly described in the article "Preventing 
Blooming in CCD Images", NASATechBriefs, July 1992, pp. 20 - 
21. This anti-blooming method does not produce acceptable results 
with a flash exposure.  It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved method of anti-blooming. There is therefore provided, in accordance with a 
preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for 
reducing bloom in output of a charge coupled device (CCD) image 
sensor including the step of toggling at least two phases of the 
CCD after exposure of the CCD. Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention, a flash of light occurs during the 
exposure. Moreover, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of 
the present invention, the step of toggling continues until an 
amount of charge stored in each element of the CCD is at a desired 
level. Further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of 
the present invention, the method includes the step of reading 
out data stored in the CCD after the step of toggling has concluded, 
wherein the step of reading out is performed in accordance 
with a desired read-out mode and wherein the desired level 
is generally close to the full well level associated with the 
read-out mode. The read-out mode can be the multi-phased pinned 
(MPP) mode or, alternatively, the buried channel mode. Still further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention, the step of toggling is performed 
with first high and low voltages, the step of reading charge out 
is performed with second high and
