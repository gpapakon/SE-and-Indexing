Method for the production of pressure-difference 
sensors having a respective semiconductor measuring 

diaphragm (2) which is clamped between two bearing 
portions (3, 4) whilst forming a respective inner 

chamber (10, 11), in which case the bearing portions 
bear a respective planar electrode (7, 9) on the inside 

and it is possible to apply one pressure to the one 
inner chamber by way of a through-opening (12) in the 

one bearing portion and to apply a further pressure of 
the pressure difference to be measured to the other 

inner chamber, and the semiconductor measuring 
diaphragm and the planar electrodes are connected to 

outer terminals (29, 31, 32), wherein 

in order to produce pressure-difference sensors 
having the outer terminals (29, 31, 32) arranged 

on the one side, a wafer (35) having a plurality 
of bearing portions (4), which are respectively 

provided with a planar electrode (9) that has a 
respective outer terminal (32), is connected, by 

means of bonding, to a further wafer (36) having a 
plurality of semiconductor measuring diaphragms 

(2), and wherein 
an additional wafer (46) having a plurality of 
further bearing portions (3), which are 

respectively provided with a planar electrode (7) 
that has a printed conductor (28), is connected, 

by means of bonding, to the further wafer (36), 
 
characterised in that 


in order to produce pressure-difference sensors 
having outer terminals (29, 31, 32) on a free 

surface (34) of a bearing portion (4), the one 
wafer (35), on its bearing portions (4), is also 

provided with further outer terminals (29, 30) 
for, in each case, the semiconductor measuring 

diaphragm (2) and, in each case, the further  
 

planar electrode (7), 
the further wafer (36) is provided with a 
rectangular through-hole (41) in each case on one 

side of the semiconductor measuring diaphragm (2), 
by means of partial cuts (44) extending through 
the further wafer (36) from the rectangular 

through-hole (41) and at an acute angle relative 
to the longitudinal extension thereof, a 

respective web (43), which lies in the course of 
the rectangular through-hole (44) (sic) and 

pertains to the further wafer (36), is isolated 
from the semiconductor measuring diaphragms (2), 
as a result of the bonding of the additional wafer 
(46), an electrical connection is established from 

the respective planar electrode (7) by way of the 
printed conductor (28) and the web (43) to the 

outer terminal (29) of the planar electrode (7), 
and 
by means of separating cuts (47) through the 
rectangular through-holes (41) in the longitudinal 

extension thereof and perpendicular thereto the 
pressure-difference sensors (1) are formed.
