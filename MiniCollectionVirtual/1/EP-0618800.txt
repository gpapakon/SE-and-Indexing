<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
Application Serial No. 07/806,985, filed December 13,
1991, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated
by reference. This invention was made with Government
support under Grant No. N0014-91-J-1230, awarded by
Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain
rights in this invention.The present invention is directed to novel glycosylated
steroid derivatives of formula (I) below, derivative-compound-conjugates
thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing them
and their use in medicaments to enhance their bioavailability. The
invention is further directed to a novel glycosylation
process for the efficient synthesis of these
glycosylated steroid derivatives.To elicit the desired biological response, a
molecule of diagnostic, prophylactic, or therapeutic
interest [termed herein "therapeutically-significant-molecule"
or "therapeutically-significant-compound"]
must be available in an effective concentration at its
site of action. Many factors determine the
concentration of a therapeutically-significant-compound
that ultimately reaches the site of action,
including the amount administered, and the extent and
rate of the compound's absorption, distribution,
biotransformation, and excretion. [Goodman and Gilman,
The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 6th
Edition, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York,
1980, pp. 1-39]. The foregoing factors may, in turn,
be influenced by the route chosen for administration
of the therapeutically-significant-compound. The most common routes of administration of
therapeutically-significant-compounds are parenteral
(intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular) and
enteral (oral ingestion), although methods to
administer therapeutically-significant-compounds
across the skin or mucosa (oral, nasal, rectal,
vaginal, etc.) also are known. Parenteral methods are
considered to be extremely effective in general,
allowing for rapid increases in blood levels of a wide
range of therapeutically-significant-compounds.
Parenteral methods are advantageous in that they
circumvent first-passage hepatic metabolism. However,
parenteral administration of a therapeutically-significant-compound
can cause pain, irritation,
possible tissue damage over the long term, and carries
a potential risk of infection. In addition,
parenteral methods frequently are inconvenient,
particularly those that are restricted to trained
medical personnel (e.g., intravenous methods).Enteral methods are more convenient than
parenteral methods, and generally are
