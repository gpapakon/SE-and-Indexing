<ABSTRACT>
The cable comprises a central core (3) and outer strands (2) formed from at least one layer of wires (21) made of metal, especially steel, which are stranded on a foundation (22) made of synthetic, preferably thermoplastic material, this taking place according to a pitch similar to that of the strands (5, 6) from which is formed the core (3) which can be completely metallic or composite. These cables are intended particularly for use as hoisting cables, especially lift cables, or other multi-cable installations with transmission by adhesion.

<CLAIMS>
Cable composed of a plurality of outer strands (2) including metal wires (21) that
are stranded over a core element (22) made from synthetic material and cabled over a central

core (3) that itself includes strands (5, 6) cabled over a central core member (4), 
characterized
in that
 the outer strands (2) are cabled at the same pitch as the strands (5, 6) of the central core
(3) and parallel to the latter, and 
in that
 said central core (3) is entirely metallic.
Cable according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the synthetic material making up
the core element (22) of the outer strands (2) is thermoplastic.
Cable according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the core element (22) of the outer
strands (2) includes aromatic fibres, carbon fibres or glass fibres.
Cable according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the core element (22) of the outer
strands (2) includes synthetic fibres with high mechanical strength which are coated with a

sheath of thermoplastic material.
Cable according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the synthetic material making up
the core element (22) of the outer strands (2) is polyethylene, polypropylene or polyamide.
Cable according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the central core member (4) is
itself made up of a strand.
