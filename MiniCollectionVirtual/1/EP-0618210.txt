<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for the 
preparation of hydrolyzable β-cyanoalkylsilanes. More 

particularly, this invention relates to the catalytic 
addition of an organohydrosilane to α,β-unsaturated olefinic 

nitriles to form β-cyanoalkylsilanes. The present process 
employs a catalyst comprising a ruthenium compound. The 

preferred catalyst for the present process is a ruthenium 
compound having at least one tertiary phosphine ligand. The 

process is conducted at a temperature within a range of 50°C. 
to 300°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a process for the 
preparation of hydrolyzable β-cyanoalkylsilanes by the 
catalytic addition of an organohydrosilane to α,β-unsaturated 
olefinic nitriles to form β-cyanoalkylsilanes. The present 
process employs a catalyst comprising a ruthenium compound. 
The preferred catalyst for the present process is a ruthenium 
compound having at least one tertiary phosphine ligand. The 
process is conducted at a temperature within a range of 50 to 
300°C. Beta-cyanoalkylsilanes having hydrolyzable halogens 
bonded to the silicon atom are useful for the production of 
polyorganosiloxanes containing the β-cyanoalkyl substituent. 
The silicon-bonded β-cyanoalkyl substituent is extremely 
resistant to hydrolysis and cleavage under hot, humid 
conditions and imparts these characteristics to the 
polyorganosiloxane of which they are a substituent. The 
presence of the silicon bonded β-cyanoalkyl substituent on 
polyorganosiloxanes also tends to stabilize the polyorganosiloxanes 
against swelling induced by liquid hydrocarbons. 
In addition, β-cyanoalkylsilanes having hydrolyzable 
chlorines are useful intermediates for forming, for example, 
gamma-aminoorganotrialkoxysilanes which are useful as surface 
treating agents. A number of catalysts have been reported useful in 
the preparation of β-cyanoalkylsilanes. For patent 
descriptions of the prior art, see U.S. Patent 
No. 2,860,153; U.S. Patent No. 2,906,764; U.S. Patent 
No. 2,907,784; U.S. Patent No. 2,971,970; U.S. Patent 
No. 5,126,468 and U.S. Patent No. 5,126,469.  For journal descriptions, see Rajkumar et al., 
Organometallics 8:549 (1989), which describes a two-component 
catalyst effective in hydrosilation of acrylonitrile leading 
to the β-addition to the double bond of the acrylonitrile. 
The catalysts therein consist of cuprous compounds, amines or 
phosphines. The present invention introduces a process for 
preparation of β-cyanoalkylsilanes described by formula 
The process comprises: contacting a mixture comprising an 
organohydrosilane described by formula 
RaXbSiH4-a-b   (2)and an olefinic nitrile described by formula 
with an effective concentration of a ruthenium compound 
catalyst at a temperature within a range of 50°C. to 300°C.; 
where each Y is independently selected from hydrogen atoms 
and alkyl radicals comprising one to eight carbon atoms; 
each R is a radical independently selected from a group 
consisting of alkyls of one to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyls 
of one to eight carbon atoms, aryl, alkoxys of one to 12
