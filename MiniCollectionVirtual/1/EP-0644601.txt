<ABSTRACT>
According to various embodiments of the present invention, there is 
provided: a superconductor has a sectional structure composed of a 

superconductor phase, metal phase and an insulating phase, wherein the 
volume of the insulating phase is expanded in a heat-treatment process 

by the phase-conversion of crystals of the insulating phase; thus, it is 
possible to achieve the densifying by heat-treatment after coil winding, 

and to obtain a superconductor less in alternating current loss.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide superconductor and its 
fabrication method, and particularly to a new oxide superconductor 
suitable for a twisted cable structure and its fabrication method. It is well known that oxide superconductors have a lot of properties 
superior to conventional metal materials. In particular, they have critical 
temperatures Tc higher than the liquid nitrogen temperature and critical 
magnetic fields more than 30 tesla. These characteristics of oxide 
superconductors make it possible to generate a ultra high magnetic field 
of 25 tesla or more which has been impossible to be obtained by 
conventional metal materials, and to realize a superconductive magnetic 
system by cooling using liquid nitrogen. The coil of such a high 
temperature superconductor is fabricated by the so-called 
winding-and-reacting method described, for example in ("Low Temperature 
Engineering", Vol. 27, No. 1, 1992, p.70-76), incorporated herein by 
reference, wherein heat-treatment is performed after winding; or by the 
so-called reacting-and-winding method described, for example in 
("Superconducting Communications", Vol. 12, No. 3, 1993), incorporated 
herein by reference, wherein winding is performed after heat-treatment.  In each of the references described above, an oxide superconductor 
coated with silver is formed into a thin tape shape, and the tape-shaped 
wire is wound into a pan-cake coil. The material of the oxide 
superconductor is represented by Tl₂Ba₂Ca₂Cu₃Ox and 
(Bi,Pb)₂Sr₂Ca₂Cu₃Ox. In each case, however, the generated magnetic 
field of the high temperature superconductor coil is not more than about 
1 tesla. The above references have another disadvantage. As is well known, the 
repeating of rolling and heat-treatment is effective to simultaneously 
achieve the densifying and orientation of the superconductor. However, 
the wire after heat-treatment is generally very weak, tending to generate 
breaking and folding or to be deformed into a sausage shape at the 
silver-superconductor interface. This makes it difficult to form a 
long-sized wire. A further disadvantage of the references lies in that the 
wire is quite insufficient in its mechanical strength against an 
electromagnetic stress when actually used, and thus it is difficult to 
prevent the generation of cracks in a compacting and a bending process. 
For this reason, the oxide superconductors cannot be formed into a 
twisted cable structure which can be usually obtained using metal based 
superconductors. Moreover, the
