<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for coating the surface of steel 
strip with a metallic coating, in which the product is 

guided without a reversal of direction vertically 
through a coating container (1) holding the molten 

coating material (2), which container has on its base 
beneath the level of the melt bath a lead-in channel 

(3) surrounded by an electric field, in the opening 
region of which channel an electromagnetic closure 

means (11) is provided which produces in the melt an 
electromagnetic force of equal size or greater, which 

is proportional in terms of quantity to the product of 
the cross-sectional surface area of the channel opening 

and the metallostatic pressure and is opposed 
vectorially to the metallostatic pressure and in which 

the dwell time of the strip in the melt can be 
controlled independent of the speed of passage of the 

strip, wherein a pre-melting container (12) is 
associated with the coating container (1) holding the 

molten coating material (2), the volume of the coating 
container (1) is designed to be many times smaller than 

the pre-melting container (12) and the coating 
container (1) for replenishing and/or emptying is 

connected to the pre-melting container (12) via feed 
(13, 29) and discharge (14, 30) channels, with the 

molten coating material (2) between the pre-melting 
container (12) and the coating container (1) being able 

to be circulated with the exclusion of atmospheric 
oxygen. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the pre-melting container (12) is arranged 

laterally beneath the coating container (1) and known 
electromagnetic pumps (15, 35) are provided for 

circulating the molten coating material (2).  
 
An apparatus according to one or more of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the coating 

container (1) is divided into two, into an inner 
container (25) with the lead-in channel (3) for the 

billet-shaped product (4) arranged on the base and an 
outer container (26) at least partly surrounding the 

inner container (26), the container walls (28) of which 
are higher than those (27) of the inner container (25), 

the outer container (26) and the inner container (25) 
being connected separately to the pre-melting container 

(12) via feed and discharge channels (29, 30) for the 
molten coating material (2). 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that in order to set the effective melt bath level 

height (h) a known immersion element (31) surrounding 
the billet-shaped product (4) with a magnetohydrodynamic 

seal (34) is guided in the inner container 
(25) so as to be able to be raised and lowered (32, 

33). 
An apparatus according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the pre-melting container (12) is 

divided into an open (37) and a closed (36) container 
part, the feed channel (29) to the inner container (25) 

of the coating container (1) being connected to the 
closed container part (36) and the discharge channel 

(30) of the outer container (26) is connected to the 
open container part (37) of the pre-melting container 

(12). 
An apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the feed channel (29) to the inner container 

(25) in the region of the closed container part (36) of 
the pre-melting container (12) is surrounded by a 

magnetic pump (35) or the like.  
 
An apparatus according to Claims 5 and 6, 
characterised in that a feed device (41) for the 

coating material (40) is arranged above the open 
container part (37) of the pre-melting container (12). 
An apparatus according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that beneath the 

lead-in channel (3) for the billet-shaped product (4) 
provided in the inner container (25) there is provided 

a runback barrier (43) for the molten coating material 
(2), between which and the lead-in channel (3) a 

discharge channel (44) passes to the open container 
part (37) of the pre-melting container (12). 
An apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised 
in that the runback barrier (43) has a mechanical 

closure. 
An apparatus according to Claims 8 and 9, 
characterised in that a slide gate (19) is provided in 

order to close the runback barrier (43), the slide 
plate (21) of which gate is designed as a shear blade 

for severing the billet-shaped product (4).
