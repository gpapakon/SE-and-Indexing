<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing metal and/or ceramic 
sheets obtained by powder sintering is described, 

comprising the following successive stages: 

a) preparation of at least one compound of metal 
and/or ceramic powders; 
b) extrusion of the compound to the required 
section and length; 
c) thermoforming of the extruded material by 
direct compression; 
d) pyrolysis of the thermoformed article thus 
eliminating substantially the polymer content 

and obtaining a semi-finished metal and/or 
ceramic sintered product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a process for 
manufacturing metal and/or ceramic sheets by 
means of powder sintering, as well as the related 
products. At present there is a well known "injection 
molding" technique, which consists of the 
preparation of a very fine granular compound (10-20 
microns) made of metal (in particular iron) or 
ceramic powders associated with polymers or 
special waxes. The compound is molded in very 
complex shapes with extremely thin finished 
product thicknesses. Once molding has been 
carried out, successive pyrolysis operations 
cause the elimination of the polymer with the 
consequent autosintering of the metal or ceramic 
powder and a reduction in the initial volume 
proportional to the percentage of polymer present 
in said powder. The product thus obtained is of 
great interest in the mechanical field. The molding technique, notwithstanding the fact 
that it produces parts with an excellent finish, 
has however a disadvantage which arises when 
parts with a particularly complicated section or 
geometric shape need to be produced. In this  
 
case, the molding of several individual and 
complementary parts, which are then welded 
together, is required. It is also well known 
that, in order to obtain finished parts with a 
certain structural complexity, it is simpler and 
it requires less work to manufacture a sheet of 
the required material by extrusion, to fold it in 
a proper shape and then to machine it according 
to requirements, rather than to weld together 
finished pieces obtained by molding. In order to obtain large machinable parts it is 
preferable to use extrusion, but some widely used 
industrial materials are difficult to obtain in 
sheet form. This is the case with magnesium and 
titanium. Magnesium because it has a crystalline 
structure which hinders any attempt at rolling; 
titanium because its cost makes it unsuitable to 
be manufactured into sheets on an industrial 
scale. The aim of this invention is to propose a 
process which will overcome the above mentioned 
disadvantages, thus allowing the manufacturing of 
a part obtained from a single sheet manufactured 
through the extrusion of a compound of any 
ceramic or metal powder associated with polymers,  
 
and also the manufacturing of a sheet obtained by 
coextrusion of a ceramic/polymers compound with a 
metal/polymers compound. For this and other aims and advantages, which 
will become clear from the following description, 
this invention proposes a process for 
manufacturing metal and/or ceramic
