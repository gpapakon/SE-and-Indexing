<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrodes 
for use in electrodialytic processes and, more 
specifically, to a bipolar electrode that produces 
hydroxyl ions on a side facing an anode and hydrogen 
ions on the opposite side nearest the cathode in a 
multi-compartment electrolytic cell. Techniques exist to employ water splitting 
membranes in electrodialytic processes. One approach, 
disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,238,305, employs a 
process that uses a two compartment electrodialytic unit 
that alternates bipolar ion exchange membranes and 
cation permselective ion exchange membranes between the 
two electrodes. This process electrodialytically 
converts impure solutions of sodium bicarbonate to high 
purity carbon dioxide and high purity and concentrated 
sodium hydroxide. However, the process disclosed in 
this reference is not cost effective when compared to 
the reliable lime-soda process traditionally employed to 
produce sodium hydroxide. This process has relatively 
high resistance that prevents it from being practiced at 
high current densities. The bipolar ion exchange 
membranes would be unstable if exposed to the high 
temperatures needed to reduce the electrolyte'S 
resistance in the electrolytic cell. Further, it is 
unlikely that high current density operation could be 
achieved simultaneously with the complete removal of 
sodium from the solution, since the conductivity of the  
 
solution is reduced when the sodium bicarbonate is 
depleted. Anion impurities, such as sulfate, must be 
added to the solution to improve the performance of the 
process. Bipolar membranes previously employed in water 
splitting applications transport water, but are limited 
by their ability to operate in strongly corrosive 
solutions, their inability to withstand high operating 
temperatures and their relatively high operating 
resistance. Other forms of bipolar membranes are known in 
the art, with further examples disclosed in US 4,969,983. It is also worth mentioning that the use of bipolar 
electrodes is known from FR-A-1 604 064, which 
discloses a multiple-cell electrodialytic apparatus for water 
desalination and comprising 
one anode, one cathode and multiple bipolar electrodes, to replace 
the anodes and the cathodes of the intermediate cells.  
 These problems are solved in the process and in 
the design of the water ionizing electrode of the 
present invention by providing a water ionizing 
electrode for use in an electrodialytic process capable 
of producing acids and alkali solutions from
