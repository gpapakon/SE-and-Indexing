<ABSTRACT>
An environmental chamber comprising a transparent dome shaped housing (12) having an annular conduit, including an exhaust port, affixed to the base of the housing. The housing fits over an end of a chemical container (68), to create a controlled environment within the encapsulated space between the housing and the container. Two openings (44, 46) at the top of the housing allow chemical transfer hoses (76, 78) to be connected to the chemical container openings. A pair of gloved access ports (48) allow an operator to access the encapsulated space to manipulate connections between the transfer hoses and the chemical container openings. The top of the housing includes an intake port (42) for delivering clean purging material into the encapsulated space to purge any chemical that escaped from the chemical openings during hook up of the transfer tubing. A sensor (38) may be included for warning of a chemical leak within the protected environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an environmental safety system, 
comprising: 
housing means forming a substantially air tight 
chamber; means extending through said housing means to provide 
access to said chamber; and means for allowing the flow of purging fluids through 
said chamber. The invention, further, relates to an environmental chamber 
system comprising: 
a generally dome shaped housing having an inner 
surface, an outer surface, a top and a base; a first hose entry port and a second hose entry port, 
for inserting chemical transfer hoses, each said hose entry 
port being formed through said housing; an intake port formed through said housing; and a pair of gloved openings formed through said housing. The invention may be used in the field of hazardous fume 
containment. Insofar, it relates to a dome shaped housing forming 
a hood or shield covering the access end of a drum containing 
toxic chemicals, the housing serving to encapsulate container 
access orifices and provide for chemical leak detection. Hazardous chemicals are commonly stored in metal or plastic 
drum containers. To access the chemicals inside the container, 
a hose entry port at the top of the container is provided for 
connection of a hose, through which the chemicals from the  
 
container will be extracted and flow to their final destination. 
An intake port, through which make-up air or gases can flow, 
is also provided at the top of the container in order to maintain 
atmospheric pressure within the container as the chemicals are 
being extracted therefrom. During non-use or transmit, the output and intake ports 
of a drum containing chemicals will be capped to prohibit escape, 
spillage or leakage of the contents therein. In order to connect 
a transfer hose to either the output port or the intake port, 
the ports must be uncapped. In the moments between uncapping 
a port and connecting a hose to that port, some amount of gas 
or vapor from within the container will escape into the atmosphere 
outside the container. The persons performing the hook up will be exposed to the 
escaped gas or vapor. Further, the chemicals that have escaped 
into the atmosphere may endanger other equipment or personnel 
in the room where the container is located, and can migrate 
to other rooms within the facility where personnel or equipment 
may not be adequately protected. Eventually the vapors will 
enter the atmospheric environment. In addition, contamination 
of the contents of the container may occur as contaminates can 
enter the open
