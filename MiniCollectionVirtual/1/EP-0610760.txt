<ABSTRACT>
A document detection system capable of detecting a 

desired document from a large number of documents easily 
and accurately in which the user can make a judgement 

concerning the appropriateness of the detection result 
quickly. In the system, those documents which contain a 

semantic structure of a detection command containing 
natural language expressions entered by a user are 

detected. Also, the keywords of each document can be 
extracted from the summary of each document and those 

documents whose keywords match with detection keywords 
specified by a user can be detected. Also, the summary of 

each detected document can be automatically generated 
according to text structures of each detected document and 

displayed along with the detected document itself. Also, 
the detection processing can be carried out with respect to 

the summaries of the documents instead of the documents 
themselves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document detection
system for detecting desired documents from a large number
of documents stored in a document database. It is to be
noted that the term "retrieval" is often used in the
literature of the field instead of the term "detection"
used in the following description. The present
specification adheres to the use of the term "detection"
throughout.In recent years, due to the significant progress and
spread of computers, the electronic manipulations of
documents are becoming increasingly popular as in the
electronic news and electronic mail systems and the CDROM
publications of data sources such as dictionaries and
encyclopedia that had only been available on papers, and it
is expected that this trend of the electronic manipulations
of documents will continue at an increasing pace in future.In conjunction with such electronic manipulations of
documents, much attentions have been attracted to a
document detection system for detecting desired documents
from a large number of documents efficiently, so as to
enable the effective utilization of the documents stored in
a database system in advance.As a conventionally available document detection
system, there has been a system which uses keywords in
combination with logic operators such as AND, OR, NOT or
proximity operators for specifying numbers of characters, 
sentences, and paragraphs that can exist between keywords,
and detects a document by using a specified combination of
keywords and operators as a detection key.However, in such a conventional document detection
system, it is not necessarily possible to detect the
document that is truly desired by a user. Namely, in a case
of employing the detection key using the logic operators,
when the specified detection key is "computer AND
designing", a document having a content of "designing by a
computer" as well as a document having a content of
"designing of a computer" can be detected, so that at least
one of them will have a content irrelevant to a desired
content. On the other hand, when the detection key using
the proximity operators is employed, the detection is based
solely on a physical distance between keywords, so that
there is no guarantee that the detected document has a
desired content.Thus, in such a conventional document detection
system, the detection result could contain many documents
with contents actually irrelevant to the desired content,
so that it has been necessary to use the detection key
formed by as many keywords that are expected to be

<CLAIMS>
A document detection system, comprising:

input means for entering a detection command containing
detection key words specified by a user;
document storage means for storing a plurality of
detection target documents, a detection target document

comprising one or more sentences of text;
summary generation means for generating a summary of
each detection target document stored in the document

storage means, a summary comprising one or more
sentences of text re-constructed from the text of the

associated detection target document, and for extracting
key words of each detection target document from the

summary of each detection target document;
detection processing means for detecting those detection
target documents stored in the document storage means_

whose key words extracted by the summary generation
means match with the detection key words in the

detection command entered at the input means as detected
documents; and
input analysis means for determining a semantic
structure of the detection command containing natural

language expressions entered by a user;

wherein the summary generation means also extracts a
semantic structure of each sentence in the summary of

each detection target document, and the detection 
processing means detects those detection target

documents whose key words match with the detection key
words and whose summary contain the semantic sentence structure

extracted by the summary generation means which matches
with the semantic sentence structure of the detection command

determined by the input analysis means.
