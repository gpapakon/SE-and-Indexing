<ABSTRACT>
Polymeric gloss modifiers, are prepared by forming 
polymer latices of a core/shell structure or a multi-layered 

structure, and coagulating and interparticle crosslinking the 
polymer latices. Said modifiers are used in preparing a low 

gloss thermoplastic resin compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for preparing 
polymeric gloss modifiers capable of reducing the surface 
gloss of a thermoplastic resin such as polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC). Further, the present invention relates to processes 
for preparing low gloss thermoplastic resin compounds, which 
comprise blending a conventional thermoplastic resin with the 
polymeric gloss modifier obtained in accordance with the 
inventive process. Various attempts have been made to develop a satisfactory 
method to reduce the surface gloss of an article shaped from 
a thermoplastic resin. Some of the proposed solutions 
include: a method of incorporating inorganic fillers such as 
silica and calcium carbonate into the thermoplastic resin; and 
a method of processing thermoplastic resin compounds at a low 
temperature and the like. However, these techniques tend to 
adversely affect the physical properties of the final 
products; and, further, result in a high production cost. In 
order to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, a method for  
 
incorporating an organic additive such as a polymeric gloss 
modifier having a lower thermal shrinkability than the 
thermoplastic base resin into the base resin has been 
developed. In this method, the crosslinked domain of the 
polymeric modifier employed as an organic additive has been 
considered as a significant factor for reducing the surface 
gloss; and, therefore, main efforts have been focused on the 
discovery of the optimum range for the crosslinked domain of 
the modifier resin. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide novel processes for efficiently and economically 
preparing polymeric gloss modifiers which can effectively 
reduce the surface gloss of a thermoplastic resin. It is another object of the present invention to provide 
a process for preparing a low gloss thermoplastic resin 
compound, which comprises blending a conventional 
thermoplastic resin with the polymeric gloss modifier obtained 
in accordance with the inventive process. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a process for preparing a polymeric gloss 
modifier, which comprises: 
(A) emulsion polymerizing a monomeric mixture including 
an aromatic vinyl monomer, an acrylic monomer, a grafting  
 
agent and, optionally, a cyanide compound and/or a 
crosslinking agent to obtain a core latex having a crosslinked 
structure; (B) conducting a graft emulsion polymerization of the 
core latex obtained in step(A) with an addition of a
