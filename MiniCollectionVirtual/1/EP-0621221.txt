<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for gripping a sheet (25) includes a first gripping member (87) and a 
second gripping member (89), one or both of which are equipped with one or more inflatable 

self adjusting gripper pads or tubes (100). The inflatable gripper pad provides a more efficient, 
reliable and cost effective method for the first gripping member and the second gripping 

member to cooperate together so as to releasably grip a sheet in a printing or copying 
machine. A spring (95) and cam following system may be used to move the first gripping 

member in relation to the second gripping member. A mechanical or electromechanical pump 
may be used to inflate and deflate the inflatable gripper pads so as to provide the gripping 

action on the sheet or so as to vary the gripping pressure created by a spring and cam system. 
The self adjusting inflatable gripper pads of the present invention permit a uniform force 

distribution or pressure to be applied along the entire length of the sheet grasping nip formed 
by the first gripping member and the second gripping member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for gripping a sheet and,
more particularly, concerns a self adjusting inflatable member for gripping the leading edge of
a sheet so that it may be pulled through the sheet path of a copying or printing machine.Sheet grippers of various designs are commonly used in copying and printing
machines, and most frequently operate by gripping the leading edge of a sheet as it is
transported through the machine. The sheet gripper must reliably and readily access the sheet,
and must maintain a firm grip without slippage on the sheet throughout the entire processing
and transport cycle. Once the sheet has been fully processed through the sheet gripper station,
the sheet is released and the sheet gripper prepares to accept and transport the next sheet.Multicolor copiers and printers often employ a gripper assembly having a set of jaws
to pull a sheet along a track for the multiple pass cycles utilized to complete the copy or
print. Present gripper assemblies commonly employ two jaws that grasp the sheet; one or
more springs generally provide the requisite sheet gripping force. The opening and closing of
the jaws may be actuated by one or more cam lifters positioned around the sheet movement
track or by similar means. A uniform gripping force or pressure should desirably be maintained
along the entire nip (the points where the gripper assembly jaws meet the sheet being
gripped), to prevent the sheet from shifting between the jaws of the sheet gripper as it is
transported. Any failure by the jaws to maintain a firm hold on the sheet can cause machine
jamming or failure, or may result in inferior print and image quality.Sheet transport failures can originate from a wide variety of sources, to include
operating conditions, manufacturing tolerances and others. The onset of even minor slippage
or skew in the sheet will cause highly visible misregistration of the different colors in a multiple
pass color system, and can cause a variety of other undesirable consequences in single or
multiple pass copier and printer systems. Sheet grippers may also fail as a result of equipment
wear and tear, operating environment variances, material handling situations and other
causes. Further, a significant percentage of sheet grippers of known designs may be produced
only to be rejected for failing to meet a relatively strict set of manufacturing tolerances that
must be adhered to. At present, machining of the jaws of such sheet grippers is necessary to
achieve the requisite sheet

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for releasably gripping an edge of a sheet (25),
comprising:


a gripping member (84) having opposed surfaces (87,89) movable
relative to one another to secure and release the edge of the sheet;

and 
characterized by
fluid pressurized means (100), operatively associated with said
gripping member, for applying a substantially uniformly distributed

force along the edge of the sheet in response to the sheet being
secured by said gripping member.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said fluid pressurized means
(100) comprises a resilient gripper pad secured to one (89) of the

surfaces of said gripping member.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said gripper pad (100) is inflatable.
The apparatus of claim 3 wherein said inflatable gripper pad (100) is filled with a
fluid selected from the group consisting of a gas, a liquid, a gel, and a fluidized foam.
The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising a sealed gripper tube secured to the
other surface of said gripping member, said gripper tube being filled with a fluid selected from

the group consisting of a gas, a liquid, a gel and a fluidized foam, wherein said inflatable
gripper tube cooperates with said inflatable gripper pad to grip the edge of the sheet.
The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising means for varying internal pressure of
said inflatable gripper pad so as to alter the forces on the sheet being secured by said gripping

member.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein said inflatable gripper pad (250) comprises:

a gripper wall (252) opposite the other surface said gripping member; and
a pump (258), associated with said inflatable gripper pad, for releasably inserting a
volume of fluid into the inflatable gripper pad to move said gripper wall so as to releasably grip

the edge of the sheet.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein said inflatable gripper pad comprises:

a sheet gripper contact surface (302) positioned opposite to and
movable in relation to the other surface of said gripper member; and 
a volume displacing wall (306) capable of moving the fluid in said
inflatable gripper pad to move said sheet gripper contact surface in relation to

the other surface of said gripping member so as to releasably grip the edge
of the sheet.
The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising:

a cam (309); and
a fluid bladder (304), actuated by said cam, to vary pressure inside said
inflatable gripper pad, whereby a a sheet gripper contact surface (302) of said inflatable gripper pad is moved in relation to

the other surface of said gripping member so as to releasably grip the edge of the sheet.
The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising an electric pump, associated with said
inflatable gripping pad, to vary pressure inside the inflatable gripper pad, whereby a a sheet gripper contact surface (302) of

said inflatable gripper pad is moved in relation to the other surface of said gripping
member so as to releasably grip the edge of the sheet.
