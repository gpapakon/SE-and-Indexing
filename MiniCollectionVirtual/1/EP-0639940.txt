<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a circuit arrangement for motor vehicles having an electrically insulating carrier board, having components which are arranged on the carrier board and produce or are sensitive to interference potential, and having conductor tracks which are arranged on the carrier board and electrically connect the components to other components, the components are surrounded by one or more conductor track rings in order to produce and achieve adequate screening simply and cost-effectively, which conductor track rings each have an interruption and are offset with respect to one another. This solution can be used both with and without screening containers.
