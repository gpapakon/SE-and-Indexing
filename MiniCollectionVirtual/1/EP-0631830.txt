cutting cross wires (32B) in automatic equipment for the 

prefabrication of building panels (2), including a bridge (16) that 
can be tilted to planes transversal to the line of conveyance 

of the panels (5) supporting a bank of electronically-controlled 
electric motor drives (43) each capable of operating corresponding 

means (33) for pulling at least one metal wire (32A) in order to push it 
and insert it at substantially any angle through the layer of 

plastic material (3) positioned between sheets of wire netting (4) 
constituting the panel (2) after passing through coaxial cutting

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device in automated equipment
for the prefabrication of sandwich building panels as set forth
in the preamble of claim 1.Sandwich-type building panels are now available made of expanded
plastic and wire netting: prefabricated structures consisting
substantially of a layer of expanded plastic material, usually
polystryrene, between two sheets of wire netting mutually
connected through electric welding by a number of cross wires
passing through this layer, to be utilized after being coated
with plaster, and placed side by side to define hollow spaces
for pouring a concrete mix in order to create walls, floors and
the like in building construction.Equipment already exists, described in EP-A 308 837 and US-A 4
917 284, for the automatic production of these building panels,
and in particular for automatically inserting the cross wires
into the layer of expanded plastic and welding them at both ends
to the netting on the two faces of the layer.This equipment, while functional, is relatively difficult to
regulate when the format of the panel varies as to its
thickness. Moreover, this equipment is poorly adapted to the
insertion of pairs of cross wires on each pass. Finally, the
equipment does not permit the insertion of the cross wires at an
angle. A device as described in the preamble of claim 1 is known from
EP-A 389 469. According to this known device, prior to introduce
the cross wires, inclined bores are drilled into the panel.
Subsequently a wire is fed by means of a pair of rollers
supported in a device the angular position of which may be
adjusted. At the bottom of the feed device a cutting device is
fastened.This prior art does not give any hint as to a simple adjusting
device for quickly regulating the entire sets of wire feeding
means, cutting means and welding means in order to adapt it to
the thickness of the panels and/or to the inclination of the
cross wires.The main object of this invention is, therefore, the design of
devices that can be quickly adjusted, each capable of pulling
and inserting, through the layer of expanded plastic comprising
the panel, one or two metal wires at practically any angle in
automatic building panel prefabrication equipment.Another purpose of this invention is to achieve the preceding
objective by means of devices that permit the unit to be
adjusted as quickly, simply and immediately as possible when the
format of the panels to be stapled varies.A further object of this invention is to achieve the preceding
objectives by simple and

Device for introducing and cutting cross wires
in automated equipment for the prefabrication of

sandwich building panels (2) formed of an upper sheet of wire
netting (4), a lower sheet of wire netting (4) and a sheet (3)

of expanded material sandwiched between the upper and lower
sheets of wire netting, said device comprising a substantially

horizontal platform (1), means (7) for advancing a panel (2) on
said platform (1) in a forward jogging motion, means for

introducing wires (32) crosswise through the building panels (2)
so as to form cross wires (32B) in the panels (2), means (34)

for cutting said cross wires above the building panels so as to
separate the cross wires from a feed supply of wire, and means

for welding the cross wires to the upper and lower sheets of

wire netting, characterised in that above said platform (1) a
tilting bridge (16) is provided which is hinged to an axis (17)

lying in said platform (1) transversely to the forward jogging
motion, said tilting bridge (16) being comprised of three

reciprocally graduated and reciprocally mobile span carriages
(19, 20, 21), supporting the means (33) for pulling and
