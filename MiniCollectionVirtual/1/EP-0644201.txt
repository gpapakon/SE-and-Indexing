<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides novel, substantially uncleavable forms of gp 160, and vaccine 
formulations containing gp 160 or a derivative thereof, adjuvanted with 3-D Mpl. 

The compositions are useful for the immunotherapeutic and immunoprophylatic 
treatment of HIV infections.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel vaccine and pharmaceutical 
formulations and to their manufacture and use in the 
treatment of AIDS. In particular the invention relates to 
the use of gp160 or derivative thereof, including novel 
forms of gp 160 in a vaccine, adjuvanted with 3-D 
Monophosphoryl lipid A. Retroviruses, that is, viruses within the family, 
Retroviridae, are a large family of enveloped, icosohedral 
viruses of about 150 nm having a coiled nucleocapsid within 
the core structure and having RNA as the genetic material. 
The family comprises the oncoviruses such as the sarcoma and 
leukemia viruses, certain immunodeficiency viruses and the 
lentiviruses. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the 
etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
also known as AIDS. This retrovirus has a complex genetic 
organisation, including the long terminal repeats (LTRs), 
the gag, pol, and env genes, and other genes. This 
retrovirus carries a number of viral antigens which are 
potential candidates either alone or in concert as vaccinal 
agents capable of inducing a protective immune response. The HIV-1 envelope protein is synthesized as a polyprotein 
precursor which is subsequently glycosylated within infected 
cells to give a glycoprotein with a mol. weight of 160 kDa 
(gp160), which is processed by proteolysis into a gp120 
external glycoprotein and gp41 transmembrane protein. A DNA coding region for proviral HIV can be prepared from 
any of the several immunodeficiency virus genomic clones 
reported in the literature. See, for example, Shaw et al.,  Science226:1165(1984); Kramer et al., Science231:1580(1986). 
Alternatively, an immunodeficiency virus 
genomic clone can be prepared from virus isolated from 
clinical specimens by standard DNA cloning techniques. See, 
for example, Gallo et al., U.S. Patent 4,520,113; Montagnier 
et al., U.S. Patent 4,708,818. The proviral DNA sequence of HIV-BH1O-2 is described by 
Ratner etal., "Human Retroviruses and AIDS" 1989, HIV 
Sequence Database ed. Gerald Meyers, Los Alamos National 
Laboratory. The sequence is 8932 bp long, the env gene 
being located at 5580-8150 and the cleavage sites therein at 
7088 and 7112 corresponding to amino acids 503 and 511 
(cleavage after these residues) (numbering according to Los 
Alamos database). According to the present invention, there is provided HIV 
gp160 which has been modified to provide amino acids other 
than lysine or arginine at positions 502 and 510 
independently. Suitable replacements for
