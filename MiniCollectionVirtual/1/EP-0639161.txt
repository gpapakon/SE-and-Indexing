Fluidised bed fermenter characterised by a conical 
fermentation zone (1) standing on its vertex and having 

two supply pipes (2 and 3) that are optionally provided 
with control valves (4 and 5), one of the supply 

pipes (2) being vertically aligned in the vertex of the 
cone and the second (3) being non-vertically aligned in 

the casing of the cone at from 0.02 to 0.3 times the 
height of the fermentation zone, and characterised by a 

sedimentation zone (6) located above the fermentation 
zone (1), which sedimentation zone (6) has one or two 

discharge pipes (7 and 8) that are optionally provided 
with control valves (9 and 10). 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent claim 1, 
characterised in that the upper diameter of the fermentation 

zone (1) is from 0.1 to 0.8 times as large as its 
height. 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that the fermentation zone (1) 

has a truncated cone vertex. 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the vertically aligned supply 

pipe (2) and the non-vertically aligned supply pipe (3) 
are so arranged that when the fermenter is put into operation 

a fluidised bed is produced in the fermentation 
zone. 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent claim 4, 
characterised in that the angle between the longitudinal  

 
axis of the non-vertically aligned supply pipe (3) and 

the horizontal straight line extending from the inlet 
opening of that supply pipe to the fermentation zone axis 

does not exceed 70° in the vertical direction and 60° in 
the horizontal direction. 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the sedimentation zone (6) 

consists of one or two cylindrical components optionally 
provided with a conical widening portion. 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent claim 6, 
characterised in that the upper diameter of the sedimentation 

zone (6) is from 1 to 3 times the upper diameter of 
the fermentation zone (1). 
Fluidised bed fermenter according to patent 
claims 6 and 7, characterised in that the sedimentation 

zone (6) is from 0.2 to 0.5 times the height of the 
fermentation zone (1). 
Use of fluidised bed fermenters according to patent 
claims 1 to 8 for the treatment of effluent or ground 

water.
