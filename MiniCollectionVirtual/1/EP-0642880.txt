<ABSTRACT>
A tool exchanger for a machining centre with a horizontal work spindle and a tool magazine accommodating the tools with a vertical axis is described. The tool exchanger has a vertically movable lifting slide (28) on which a double-armed gripper (94) is arranged. The gripper (94) is mounted in a gripper head (66) which is pivotable between a position with a horizontal gripper axis (90) and a vertical gripper axis (90). The pivoting movement of the gripper head (66) and the pivoting movement of the gripper (94) about its gripper axis are effected via the same drive (44, 46, 50, 52) which produces the lifting movement of the lifting slide (28).

A tool changing device for a machining centre having a 
horizontal work spindle, having a tool store in which the 

tools are disposed with axes vertical, having a carriage 
movable in a horizontal direction perpendicular to the 

work spindle (V-axis), having a lifting slide movably 
mounted in the carriage in the vertical direction (U-axis), 

having a motor driving the lifting slide in the 
vertical direction (U-axis) and mounted in the carriage, 

having a gripper head pivoted on the lifting slide and 
having a two-arm gripping device pivoted to the gripper 

head by a gripping device arbor, whereby the gripping 
device can be moved between positions with vertical and 

with horizontal arrangement of the tools,
characterised in that
 the carriage (26) can be moved in 
a horizontal direction (W-axis) parallel to the work 

spindle (16),
in that
 the gripper head (66) moves into a slide track 
(114) of the carriage (26) with the vertical movement of 

the lifting slide (28) and is swivelled between a 
position with horizontal and a position with vertical 

gripping device arbor (90),
in that
 the motor (42) drives the lifting slide (28) via 
endlessly rotating traction means (44, 46, 50, 52), 


and in that
 the traction means (46, 50, 52) reversibly 
drive the swivel movement of the gripping device (94) 

around its gripping device arbor (90). 
A tool changing device according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the arms (96, 98) of the gripping 
device (94) are disposed perpendicularly to one another 

and perpendicularly to the gripping device arbor (90).  
 
A tool changing device according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 the gripper head (66) is fixed to 
the lifting slide (28) with a locking device which is 

detachable for the swivelling of the gripper head (66). 
A tool changing device according to Claim 3, 

characterised in that
 the locking device comprises an 
index pin (70) mounted in the gripper head (66), which 

engages in the lifting slide (28) and during the lifting 
movement of the lifting slide (28) is raised via an entry 

slope (118) out of the lifting slide (28). 
A tool changing device according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the traction means comprise a 
toothed belt (46) revolving over an upper pulley (50) and 

a lower pulley (52) of the lifting slide (28). 
A tool changing device according to Claim 5, 

characterised in that
 one of the pulleys (50) can be 
locked in order to drive the lifting slide (28) by means 

of the toothed belt (46), and is reversible over a 
limited angle of rotation in order to drive the swivel 

movement of the gripping device (94) when the lifting 
slide (28) is stationary. 
A tool changing device according to Claim 6, 

characterised in that
 the gripping device (94) is driven 
by means of a bevel gear (92) seated on its gripping 

device arbor (90), which gear is in engagement with a 
bevel gear (82) connected in a rotationally secure manner 

with one of the pulleys (52). 
A tool changing device according to Claim 7, 

characterised in that
 an axially displaceable splined 
shaft (80) is connected in a rotationally secure manner 

to the pulley (52),
and in that
 two axially spaced bevel gears (82 and 84) 
with their points directed towards one another are 

attached to the splined shaft (80), which gears can be 
selectively brought into engagement with the bevel gear 

(92) of the gripping device arbor (90) by axial 
displacement of the splined shaft (80) in order to 

determine the swivelling direction of the gripping device 
(94). 
A tool changing device according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 the tool store (30) is disposed in 
a horizontal plane above the work spindle (16) and 

consists of tool holding fixtures (36) disposed in rows 
parallel to the axis of the work spindle (16), between 

which channels (38) remain free for the introduction of 
the gripping device (94).
