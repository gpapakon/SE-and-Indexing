<ABSTRACT>
An enclosure (16) having cable terminations is fitted on a flange (14) of an enclosure (10) of an electrical switching installation. The enclosure (16) is preinstalled and aligned at such a distance (D) from the adjacent flange (14) of the switching installation enclosure (10) that the free ends of the cable conductors are at a distance (h) from the flange (14) of the switching installation enclosure. This makes it possible to see clearly the contact pieces (28, 29) on the cable conductors and the mating contact pieces (26) on the phase slides (24, 25), and makes them freely accessible. After the contact pieces (28, 29) have made contact with the mating contact pieces (26), a tubular piece (30) which is located in the enclosure (16) is drawn out of the enclosure, its radial flanging (31) strikes against the adjacent flange (14) of the switching installation enclosure (10), and is fastened there. The tubular piece element (30) is fixed and sealed by means of a clamping flange ring (32) which is fitted on that flange (23) of the enclosure (16) which is on the switching installation side.
