<ABSTRACT>
A high density, enzyme-containing powder detergent 
composition including a combination of alkaline proteases 

for improved cleaning characteristics and a combination 
of different density sodium carbonates for improved 

dispensing characteristics. The enzymes may comprise a 
blend of ESPERASE, MAXACAL (SAVINASE
) and KAZUSASE. The 
sodium carbonate content may comprise 10% to 17% of the 

composition having a density of from 0.50 g/ml to 0.56 
g/ml and 15.5% to 32.5% of the composition having a 

density of from 0.60 g/ml to 0.65 g/ml.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent 
compositions and methods for producing the same, having 
improved cleaning characteristics and improved flow 
characteristics. Laundry detergents are expected to 
remove various kinds of soils from fabrics or clothes and 
to be easily dispensed from their containers. Regarding 
the removal of soils, among the soils expected to be 
removed by laundry detergents are oil-based soils 
including mineral oil, olive oil, wool fat and sebum. 
Other soils expected to be removed by laundry detergents 
are stains such as grass, wine, tea, blood, milk, ink and 
cocoa. The detergency of detergent compositions largely is 
based upon their efficacy in removing the above-mentioned 
kinds of soils from fabric or clothes. It is well-known 
that while certain types of detergent compositions may 
exhibit strong detergency against one kind of soil, they 
may not exhibit good detergency against another. One approach the art has taken to improve the 
effectiveness of detergent compositions is by the 
addition of enzymes such as proteases, amylases and 
lipases into detergent compositions. For example, 
alkaline proteases produced by cultivation of strains of 
Bacillus sp. in suitable nutrient media are widely used 
in detergent compositions. Examples of such commercial 
protease products are ALCALASE, ESPERASE and SAVINASE, 
all supplied by NOVO Industri A/S, Denmark. These and 
similar enzyme products such as MAXACAL from other 
commercial sources are active in detergent solutions, 
i.e., at pH values in the range of from 7 to 12 and in 
the presence of sequestering agents, surfactants and 
bleaching agents, such as sodium perborate. ALCALASE is  
 
produced by strains of the species Bacillus 
licheniformis. ESPERASE and SAVINASE are obtained by 
cultivation of strains of alkalophilic Bacilli according 
to US-A-3 723 250. Since about 1928, various cleaning compositions, 
whether laundry detergents, dishwashing detergents, dry 
cleaning chemicals, etc., were patented which use two or 
more different enzymes, such as proteases and amylases, 
e.g., US-A-1 660 458 and combinations of two different 
protease enzymes with an amylase, e.g., US-A-2 607 539; 
3 634 266 and 3 741 901. US-A-4 511 490 discloses only 
combinations of two alkaline protease enzymes. In 
February 1982, Amway Corporation offered for sale and 
placed in public use a detergent incorporating the 
alkaline protease enzymes ALCALASE™ and ESPERASE™ 
available from NOVO, and an amylase enzyme. US-A-4 927 558 reports
