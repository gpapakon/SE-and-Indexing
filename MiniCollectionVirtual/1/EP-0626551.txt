<ABSTRACT>
A device for the arrangement of a cradle, which is fitted with a light weapon (W), on the roof (1) of an unarmoured motor vehicle, especially a passenger vehicle, and for pivoting the cradle and the weapon (W) into the interior of the vehicle. A closeable opening (2) is provided in the roof (1) of the motor vehicle. Mounted underneath the opening (2) is a ball-type ring mount (3) on which a bearing flange (6) is arranged. This bearing flange (6) has lugs (7) which point downwards into the interior of the vehicle and to which one end of each of four pivoting levers (8, 9) is fastened, such that said levers can rotate. The pivoting levers (8, 9), which are bent in the direction of the opening edge, can pivot in vertical, mutually parallel pivoting planes. Two of the pivoting levers (8, 9) in each case form a parallelogram linkage and are fastened at their other end to a base plate (10), such that they can rotate, on which base plate (10) a carriage (11) is arranged. This carriage (11) can be displaced and a pivoting journal (13) is mounted on it such that it can rotate. A retaining fork is arranged on the free end of the said pivoting journal (13) and the weapon holder is mounted therein such that it can be pivoted in a vertical plane. The weapon (W) can be pivoted manually in and out through the opening (2).

Motor vehicle having a device for mounting a cradle 
carrying a light weapon on the roof of an unarmoured motor 

vehicle, in particular a cross-country car, and for pivoting 
in the cradle and weapon into the vehicle interior, wherein 


in the roof (1) of the motor vehicle an aperture (2) 
closable by means of a skylight cover (23) is provided and 

structural elements (4, 5) reinforcing the roof panel (1) are 
provided in the region of the aperture (2), and 
the weapon is rotatably mounted by means of a pivot pin 
(13), on whose free end a receiving fork is provided in which 

the weapon seat (14) is pivotably mounted in a vertical plane, 
 
characterised in that on the reinforcing structural elements 

(4, 5) below the aperture (2) and concentric thereto a ball 
rotary crown (3) is fixed, on whose rotary inner ring (3.1) a 

bearing flange (6) is rigidly disposed, which has four plates 
(7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4) pointing down into the vehicle 

interior, on which four pivot levers (8, 9, 8.1, 9.1) are 
pivotably fixed with their one end, wherein the pivot levers 

bent back in the direction of the aperture edge are pivotable 
in vertical mutually parallel pivot planes and each two pivot 

levers (8, 9; 8.1, 9.1) form adjacent parallelogram linkages 
and with their other end are fixed via a rotary connection to 

a base plate, on which a slide (11) is provided which is 
displaceable in the direction parallel to the pivotal planes 

and on which the pivot pin (13) is rotatably mounted. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
slide (11) is guided on guide rods (12, 12.1) connected to the 

base plate (10).  
 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the slide (11) is held in its position relative to the base 

plate (10) by two gas pressure springs (15, 15.1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the slide (11) is lockable in a predetermined position on 

the base plate (10) by a spring-actuated locking bolt (16). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that to counterbalance the parts of the device pivotable into 

the vehicle interior, including the weapon and cradle, two gas 
draw springs (17, 17.1) are provided, which are disposed 

between the base plate (10) and respectively the inner end of 
a pivot lever (9, 9.1) forming the parallelogram linkage. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised by 
a pivotable bolt device (18, 18.1) for bolting the 

parallelogram linkage in the pivoted-out position. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised by 
a padded back rest (19) disposed in the aperture (2) on a 

rotary inner ring (3.1) of the ball rotary crown (3) opposite 
the region of the bearing flange (6).
