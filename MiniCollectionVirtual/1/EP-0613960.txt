<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-resistant cast 
steel suitable for exhaust equipment members for automobiles, etc., 
and more particularly to a heat-resistant, austenitic cast steel 
having excellent high-temperature strength and machinability, and 
an exhaust equipment member made of such a heat-resistant, 
austenitic cast steel. Some of conventional heat-resistant cast iron and heat-resistant 
cast steel have compositions shown in Table 3 as 
Comparative Examples. In exhaust equipment members such as 
exhaust manifolds, turbine housings, etc. for automobiles, heat-resistant 
cast iron such as high-Si spheroidal graphite cast iron, 
heat-resistant cast steel such as ferritic cast steel, NI-RESIST cast 
iron (Ni-Cr-Cu austenitic cast iron) shown in Table 3, etc. are 
employed because their operating conditions are extremely severe 
at high temperatures. Further, attempts have been made to propose various 
heat-resistant, austenitic cast steels. For instance, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. 61-87852 discloses a heat-resistant, austenitic cast 
steel consisting essentially of C, Si, Mn, N, Ni, Cr, V, Nb, Ti, B, W and 
Fe showing improved creep strength and yield strength. In 
addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-177352 discloses a 
heat-resistant, austenitic cast steel consisting essentially of C, Si, 
Mn, Cr, Ni, Al, Ti, B, Nb and Fe having improved high-temperature  
 
and room-temperature properties by choosing particular oxygen 
content and index of cleanliness of steel. Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 57-8183 discloses a heat-resistant, austenitic cast 
Fe-Ni-Cr steel having increased carbon content and containing Nb 
and Co, thereby showing improved high-temperature strength 
without suffering from the decrease in high-temperature oxidation 
resistance. Among these conventional heat-resistant cast irons and 
heat-resistant cast steels, for instance, the high-Si spheroidal 
graphite cast iron is relatively good in a room-temperature 
strength, but it is poor in a high-temperature strength and an 
oxidation resistance. Heat-resistant, ferritic cast steel is extremely 
poor in a high-temperature yield strength at 900°C or higher. The 
NI-RESIST cast iron is relatively good in a high-temperature 
strength up to 900°C, but it is poor in durability at 900°C or higher. 
Also, it is expensive because of high Ni content. Since the heat-resistant, austenitic cast steel disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-87852 has a relatively low C 
content of 0.15 weight % or less, it shows an
