<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the conversion of hydrocarbons and,
more specifically, to contact material compositions and oxidative conversion
processes using such compositions.As the uncertain nature of the limited supplies of and access to crude oil
has become increasingly apparent, alternative sources of hydrocarbons and
fuels have been sought out and explored. The conversion of low molecular
weight alkanes (lower alkanes) to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons has
received increasing consideration as such low molecular weight alkanes may
be generally available from more readily secured and reliable sources.
Natural gas, partially as a result of its comparative abundance, has received a
large measure of the attention that has focused on sources of low molecular
weight alkanes. Large deposits of natural gas, mainly composed of methane,
are found in many locations throughout the world. In addition, low molecular
weight alkanes are generally present in coal deposits and may be formed
during numerous mining operations, in various petroleum processes, and in
the above- or below-ground gasification or liquefaction of coal, tar sands, oil
shale and biomass, for example.Today, much of the readily accessible natural gas generally has a high
valued use as a fuel whether in residential, commercial or in industrial
applications. Additional natural gas resources, however, are prevalent in
many remote regions of the world, such as remote areas of Western Canada,
Africa, Australia, U.S.S.R. and Asia. Commonly, natural gas from these remote
resources is referred to as "remote natural gas" or, more briefly, "remote gas."In many such remote regions, the widespread, direct use of the natural
gas as a fuel is generally not currently profitable. Further, the relative
inaccessibility of gas from such resources is a major obstacle to the more
effective and extensive use of remote gas as the transportation of the gas to
distant markets wherein the natural gas could find direct use as a fuel is
typically economically unattractive. Of course, while the primary current use of natural gas is as a fuel,
natural gas may alternatively be used as a feedstock for chemical
manufacture. In fact, natural gas is a primary chemical feedstock for the
manufacture of numerous chemicals, such as methanol, ammonia, acetic acid,
acetic anhydride, formic acid, and formaldehyde, for example. However, the
markets for such chemicals are fairly limited in size. Consequently, methods
for converting low molecular weight alkanes, such as those
