<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an oriented, heat-sealable, multilayer polyolefin film which comprises a base layer containing polypropylene and resin, and at least one heat-sealable top layer. The heat-sealable top layer contains a propylene copolymer and/or a propylene terpolymer and a mixture of an antiblocking agent having a mean particle diameter of from 3 to 5  mu m and a further antiblocking agent having a mean particle diameter of from 1 to 2.5 mu m. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the multilayer polyolefin film and to the use of the film.
