<ABSTRACT>
Column packings for liquid chromatography comprising 
porous ceramics granules which have hydrophilic surfaces and 

are prepared by calcining a crystalline clay mineral having 
fibrous structure is disclosed. Median pore diameter of the 

porous ceramics granule is preferably in the range from 
0.001µm to 0.1µm. The crystalline clay mineral is preferably 

sepiolite or attapulgite. A method for separating lipids or 
vitamins comprising the steps of: filling the column packings

containing lipids or vitamins; and flowing eluent through the 

column to separate and elute the lipids or the vitamins in the 
sample is also disclosed. The column packings for liquid 

chromatography of the present invention has a high mechanical 
strength and is pressure resistant and very stable to eluent 

having a high pH value and/or a high polarity so that the 
separating characteristics thereof are not changed even after 

a long time use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to column packings for
liquid chromatography and methods for separating materials
using the column packings. More particularly, the present
invention relates to column packings for liquid chromatography
comprising porous ceramics granules having a hydrophilic surface
which are prepared by calcining a crystalline clay mineral
having fibrous structure, and a method for separating materials
using the column packings.Liquid chromatography is a chromatography utilizing
liquids as mobile phase. Various types of liquid
chromatography have been developed for separating.Liquid chromatography is classified, depending on the
principle of separation, into ion-exchange chromatography,
partition chromatography, adsorption chromatography, gel
permeation chromatography, affinity chromatography or the
like. Also, it is classified, depending on the method of
operation, into downward flow method, upward flow method, high
performance liquid chromatography or the like.Among them, high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) has high separating performance, and the throughput
speed is very high so that it has recently spread
rapidly. The HPLC uses essentially uniform and extremely fine
spherical granules as stationary phase (which is referred to 
as "column packings" hereinafter).As conventional column packings for HPLC, besides
silica gel, modified silica gels in which silica gel is
modified with an octadecyl group or an amino group or the like,
ion exchange resin comprising synthetic polymers, such as
polystyrene and polyvinyl, and column packings comprising
natural polymers or the like have been used.Silica gel has been used for separating lipid-related
materials as column packings for adsorption
chromatography, utilizing the excellent adsorption performance of
silanol groups existing in a great number on internal
surfaces of the pores. However, silica gel may be easily dissolved
in water and has a very low resistance to high pH eluents. Thus
it could be hardly used for separating samples using such
eluents.On the other hand, as inorganic column packings,
active china clay and synthetic zeolite have been
conventionally used for separation by adsorption or the like.
They had, however, no sufficient separation performances as
column packings for chromatography and could not be used for
HPLC.In addition, column packings for chromatography
prepared from hydroxy apatite as raw material which was
recently developed have a high mechanical strength and low
solubility in eluents and thus they are

<CLAIMS>
Column packings for liquid chromatography comprising
porous ceramic granules, characterized in that the porous

ceramic granules have hydrophilic surfaces and a median pore
diameter in the range from 0.001 µm to 0.1 µm, and that the

porous ceramic granules are prepared by the steps comprising

(a) calcining granules of a crystalline clay mineral having a fibrous
structure and a grain size in the range from 1 to 100 µm;
(b) subjecting the granules to an acid treatment to render
the surfaces of said granules hydrophilic; and
(c) calcining the granules a second time to avoid any decrease
in pore volume, the resultant porous ceramic granules
