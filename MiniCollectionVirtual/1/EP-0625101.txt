<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
controlling a damper or shock-absorber interposed between 
a suspended mass and an excited moving mass and, more 
particularly, to the use of such a method for controlling 
a damper forming part of a suspension device of the 
semi-active type for a motor vehicle. Figure 1 of the appended drawing diagrammatically 
represents a device of this type, known from the prior art. 
The device conventionally comprises a spring 1 and a 
damper 2 interposed between a suspended mass 3 and an 
excited mass 4. The suspended mass is made up of the part 
of the body of a motor vehicle which is supported by a 
wheel whilst the excited mass is made up of this wheel and 
a suspension arm for the wheel, shown diagrammatically in 
the figure by the mass 4 and the spring 5 representing the 
elasticity of a tyre fitted to the wheel which rests on the 
ground 6. The role of the damper 2 is to absorb the energy 
stored within this spring and masses system in order to 
prevent this energy from bringing about oscillations of the 
body and of the wheels of the vehicle, with respect to the 
ground. The system made up of the wheel and its tyre, the 
suspension arm, the spring and the suspended mass has two 
resonant frequencies usually located within the band of 1 
to 2 Hz for the suspended mass and within the band of 10 
to 15 Hz for the excited mass. Damping is mainly used in 
order to reduce the amplitude of the oscillations in these 
two frequency bands. However, on the other hand, it reduces 
the capability of the suspension to filter at other 
frequencies. So-called "adaptive" suspensions are known, in  
 
which the damping coefficient of the dampers is controlled 
by an electronic computer which processes representative 
measurements of the actions of the driver (angle of 
rotation of the steering wheel, acceleration, braking 
pressure, etc.) in order to stabilize the vehicle when it 
is stressed by such actions. Such adaptive suspensions also 
make it possible to take account of the driving style which 
the driver desires ("sporty" or "comfortable", for example) 
and of the average state of the road. In order to take account of the stresses due to 
the deformations of the road, the damping coefficient of 
the damper can be varied in real time. A suspension system 
designed in this way is called "semi-active". The variation 
in damping may be obtained, for example, by controlling the 
flow rate of a liquid passing between the two chambers 7, 8 
of the damper situated on either

Method for controlling a damper interposed 
between a suspended mass and an excited moving mass, in 

parallel with a spring, of the type in which the damper 
is selectively hardened or softened when the sign of the 

product of the relative position (p) and speed (v) of 
the suspended mass with respect to the excited mass, 

becomes respectively negative or positive, characterised 
in that : 


the frequency of the movement of the suspended mass 
with respect to the excited mass is evaluated from 

that of the product (p.v) function by measuring the 
duration (Î”t
n
) of one alternation of the product 
function, and comparing this duration to 

predetermined durations each associated with one of 
the limits of at least one predetermined frequency 

band, and 
the damper is hardened when the product (p.v) 
function passes to a negative value only if, at this 

instant, the said frequency lies within the 
predetermined frequency band. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that the frequency of the product 

function is estimated from the duration of one alternation 
of this function which precedes the passage of 

the function from a positive value to a negative value. 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that the frequency of the 

movement of the suspended mass is compared to at least 
two frequency bands centred respectively on the resonant 

frequency of the suspended mass and on the resonant frequency 

of the excited mass of the system made up of the 
suspended mass, the spring, the damper and the excited 

mass. 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the position of the  

 
suspended mass with respect to the excited mass is 

compared to at least one predetermined deflection (S
1
+, 
S
1
-) of the suspended mass about the equilibrium position 
and the damper is hardened only if the said position is 

situated outside the said deflection at the instant at 
which the sign of the product function becomes negative. 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the position of the 

suspended mass is further compared to a second 
predetermined deflection (S
2
-, S
2
+) about its equilibrium 
position, while the product function passes to a 

positive value, and the damper is softened only if the 
said position lies within the said deflection (S
2
-, S
2
+). 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the position (p) of the 

suspended mass with respect to the excited mass is taken 
from a sensor (14) delivering a position signal and this 

signal is filtered in order to enhance the noise 
immunity of the method. 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 4 
to 6, characterised in that the position (p) of the 

suspended mass with respect to the excited mass is 
compared with several predetermined deflections associated 

with as many different hardness levels of the 
damper, and the damper is hardened to a level associated 

with the deflection exceeded by the said position. 
Use of the method in accordance with any one 
of Claims 1 to 7, for controlling a damper (2) forming 

part of a suspension device of a motor vehicle, this 
device comprising a spring (1) installed in parallel 

with the damper between a suspended mass made up of the 
body of the vehicle and an excited mass made up of a 

suspension arm supporting a wheel resting on a driving 
surface. 
Use in accordance with Claim 8, characterised 
in that the two dampers of one same axle of the vehicle 

are controlled by taking into account the mean relative  
 

position and speed of the body with respect to the two 
wheels of the axle, instead of taking into account the 

relative position and speed of the suspended mass 
supported by a single wheel. 
Use in accordance with Claim 8, characterised 
in that positions and speeds representing pitching 

and/or pumping movements of the body of the vehicle are 
taken into account instead of taking into account the 

relative position and speed of the body with respect to 
one wheel, so as to stabilise the body in pitching 

and/or in pumping, respectively.
