<ABSTRACT>
A shower head with a cleaning device which exhibits pins (19, 30) for penetrating the jet-outlet openings (11, 12) contains at least two groups of jet-outlet openings (11, 12). The cleaning device contains at least one group of cleaning elements (19, 30) which serve to penetrate in each case one group of jet-outlet openings (11, 12). The cleaning device is designed such that there is one position in which not one hole is closed off by a cleaning element, but there is, on the other hand, also no position in which all the holes are closed off by cleaning elements.

device having at least two groups of cleaning elements (19, 30),
whereof each group is operable for the cleaning of a group of jet outlets

(11, 12), as well as with an operating device, which, for cleaning a group
of jet outlets (11, 12) brings each group of cleaning elements (19, 30)

into engagement with the latter and constructed in such a way that at least
one group of cleaning elements (19, 30) is always 
disengaged.
