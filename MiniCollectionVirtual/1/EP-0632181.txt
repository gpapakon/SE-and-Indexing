<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is constituted by push-rod actuators. They are used for swinging out and swinging in or adjusting wings/flaps, in particular wings of roof-light openers. The invention proposes to provide a compact damper cage (20), with which a pull/push sleeve (4) can be moved linearly. This linear movement is dependent on a rotary movement of a spindle rod (3) which is driven in rotation by a motor (1). In the vicinity of one end, the motor (1) is arranged fixedly in a cylinder housing (10). The damper cage (20) may be configured such that provision is made for a bidirectionally acting spring device (21a, 21b; 21; 23) which resiliently mounts the nut (22) which can move solely in the linear manner. Two alternatives for this are demonstrated, on the one hand an elastic ring buffer (23) and, on the other hand, two flat springs (21a, 21b). This results in the most sensitive part of a push-rod actuator - the motor - remaining fixed and axially captive in the housing. Both it and the motor-side bearing of the spindle rod can be aligned and manufactured more simply and precisely and have a longer service life. When manufacturing is simplified, then the price is also reduced.
