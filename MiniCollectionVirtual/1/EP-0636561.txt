<ABSTRACT>
A linear motor driven transport system of an improved 
design is presented. The conventional roller configuration for 

holding the transport vehicle (2) on the rail track has been 
replaced with a spring-loaded design so as to maintain the 

contact between the roller and the rail surface regardless of 
the curvatures in the routing track (1). Weighing device (4) of an 

improved direct-loading design is adopted to improve the 
ruggedness of the device. Devices for controlling the 

positioning of the transport vehicle, including the carrier, 
have been simplified and the number of component pieces reduced 

to lower the cost of manufacturing the transport system. The 
container and track configurations have also been modified to 

enable efficient track set-up and loading/unloading of goods in 
complex track routing in a l
imited space. The primary drive 
unit, the vehicle stopping device (5), the vehicle position 

detection device (6) and the emergency braking unit (7) provided only in 
the vertical section of the track are all placed on the side of 

the rail which faces the transport vehicle (2). This arrangement of 
the components on one side of the rail facilitates 

manufacturing, assembling and servicing of the components. The 
overall result is that not only the cost of manufacturing the 

system has been reduced, but also the overall transportation 
operation has been improved with minimal maintenance 

requirements so as to enable the application of the transport 
system in any facility requiring handling of a large number of 

goods and information, such as parts, medical charts, and 
documentations in factories, hospitals, libraries and other such 

organizations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a transport
system for transporting objects between stations, and relates in
particular to improvements in the various active components of a
linear motor driven transport system to achieve higher
operational performance compared with that of conventional
systems.Whenever there is a need to transfer objects such as goods,
materials and information in manufacturing lines, to transport
of drugs and medical charts in hospitals, various transporting
systems have been in use through the years. In these
transporting systems, some key components of the system are
assembled together to produce a unified transportation system.
Some of the components of a conventional transporting system
based on a linear motor drive will be explained in some detail
in the following under respective headings.The presentations are divided into eight component groups
as follows:
(1) Transport drive, including transport vehicle, carrier
and rail track configuration;(2) Weighing device;(3) Vehicle stopping device;(4) Vehicle position detection device; (5) Primary drive unit structure;(6) Emergency braking device;(7) Rail track structure;(8) Container structure.
Each of the above components will be discussed sequentially in
detail with illustrated examples from conventional systems.An example of a type of routing in a transport system
applicable to the present invention is shown in Figure 34.In Figure 34, a transport vehicle 101 controlled by a
command and control device (not shown) runs along a fixed track
102 installed along a transport route. Hereinafter, various
components used in the system are referred to as either on the
immobile side or on the mobile side. In the following
presentation, references are sometimes made to mobile or
immobile side of the transport system. This reference is in
relation to the two surfaces of the fixed track, i.e. the mobile
side of the fixed track is the side facing the transport
vehicle, and similarly the immobile side means the opposite
side of the fixed rail.In some transport systems, a vertical transport route is
needed, such as the track 102V shown in Figure 34, as well as a
horizontal track 102H. Such a routing comprises an internally
curving track 102C which joins the horizontal track 102H with
the vertical track 102V, and an externally curving track 102C'
which joins the vertical track 102V with the horizontal track 
102H, respectively shown by curved arrows in Figure 34.
Although not shown in this figure, other track configurations,
such as
