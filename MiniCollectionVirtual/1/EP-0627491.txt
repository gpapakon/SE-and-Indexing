<ABSTRACT>
A method for screening for sterol biosynthesis inhibitors 
of potential use as fungicides or antihypercholesterolemic 

agents identifies agents by the induction of 
lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, an enzyme in the biosynthetic 

pathway of ergosterol and cholesterol, in cultures containing 
the agents. In a preferred screening test, test 

samples are incubated in a culture of a 
Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae
 strain sensitive to ergosterol biosynthesis and 
containing a gene fusion of a lanosterol 14-α-demethylase 

clone with a gene for bacterial β-galactosidase. After 
incubation of the culture, an increase in lanosterol 14-α-demethylase 

activity is determined indirectly by measuring 
β-galactosidase activity. The culture media contains a 

chromogenic substrate of β-galactosidase such as orthonitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside 
or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-D-galactoside, 

so that active samples are identified by 
the production of colored product. For comparison purposes, 

preferred embodiments employ a lanosterol 14-α-demethylase 
inhibitor such as dinaconazole as a positive 

control.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screening method for the
identification of agents exhibiting potential fungicidal
and antihypercholesterolemic activity, based upon the
inhibition of ergosterol and/or cholesterol biosynthesis.Ergosterol is the principal membrane sterol of fungi.
It is structurally similar to its animal counterpart, cholesterol,
except that ergosterol has a methyl group and
two double bonds not present in cholesterol. In yeast,
ergosterol affects membrane fluidity and permeability and
plays an essential role in the yeast cell cycle. Yeast
cells can take up cholesterol and decrease their requirement
for ergcsterol to very low levels, but cholesterol
alone cannot completely substitute for ergosterol (Gaber,
R.F., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9: 3447-3456 (1989)).Though the biosynthesis of ergosterol in fungi involves
steps distinct from cholesterol biosynthesis in
animals, sterol biosynthesis in different organisms share
many common steps. One of the enzymes in the biosynthesis
of ergosterol is sterol-14-demethylase. A method for
screening for inhibitors of sterol-14-demethylase is known
from ACS Symp. Ser., 497, 1992, 162-173. Implicated in sterol biosynthesis is
at least one cytochrome P450. The term "cytochrome P450"
is a trivial name for a class of cytochromes that includes
a number of heme proteins exhibiting a characteristic
absorption maximum at 450 nm when combined with CO in the
reduced state ('P' denotes pigment; hence, the name).
These cytochromes occur in most animal tissues, plants and
microorganisms and catalyze the monooxygenation of a vast
variety of hydrophobic substances, including lipophilic 
endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, serving as oxygenating
catalysts in the presence of one or more electron-transfer
proteins or redox enzymes.Several distinct cytochrome P450 proteins have been
described in yeast and fungi, and the structural genes encoding
these proteins, have been isolated (Kalb, V.F., et
al., Gene 45: 237-245 (1986) and Turi, T.G., and Loper,
J.C., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 2046-2056 (1992)). Of these,
the most thoroughly characterized is the lanosterol 14-α-demethylase
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ERG11), which was
one of the first S. cerevisiae enzymes in the ergosterol
biosynthetic pathway to be cloned. The sequence of the
gene has been published, and the protein shown to be
essential for aerobic growth (Kalb, V., et al., DNA 6:
529-537 (1987)). This cytochrome P450 catalyzes the
oxidative removal of a methyl group at the carbon at
position 14 of lanosterol during the
