<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the determination of in vivo exposure to dioxinlike compounds and the in vitro quantitation of dioxinlike compounds based on protein tyrosine phosphorylation as mediated by the Ah receptor. The extend of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is determined by monoclonal antibodies to protein tyrosine phosphate. The amount and nature of protein tyrosylphosphate is quantitatively related to the in vivo or in vitro concentration of dioxin to which animals or cells were exposed. This method permits detection of dioxinlike compounds at concentrations in the parts per trillion and parts per billion range.

<DESCRIPTION>
Over the last several decades, dioxins have become the
subject of intense public and scientific scrutiny. This is the
result of not only their great toxicity but also their assumed
widespread presence in the environment. The toxicology of
dioxins has been addressed principally through studies of their
mechanism of biological action using animal models and cell
cultures systems. In addition the potential threat that dioxins
present to human health has been addressed in only a limited
manner through epidemiologic studies of populations known to have
been exposed to dioxins. The environmental issues have been
addressed through the study of the production, release and fate
of dioxins and related substances. Although dioxins have been
extensively studied during the last twenty years, the exact
mechanism of toxicity of dioxins in biological systems and the
extent of environmental distribution are unknown. This is due in
part to a lack of a simplified method of assessing the exposure
of biological systems to dioxin and related compounds.The term dioxin, as commonly used by the news media, is
a shorthand for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD
is only one member (congener) of the polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxin family, of which there are 75 possible congeners
whose structures vary according to the number and location of the
chlorine atoms. A source of confusion is that the term "dioxin"
is used to indicate either TCDD specifically, or the PCDD
(polychlorinated dibenzodioxin) family in general. Biologically,
TCDD is the most potent PCDD; most other PCDDs are less active by
a factor ranging from several thousands to millions. TCDD has
been studied most extensively of all the PCDD congeners.Several other aromatic hydrocarbons share biological
properties with TCDD, particularly when substituted with chlorine 
in the lateral positions. The most important of these are the
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain members of the
polychlorinated biphenyl family (PCBs) The large number of
possible PCDD (75), PCDF (135) and PCB (20) congeners greatly
complicates environmental analysis, and complex clean up
procedures are required before such analyses can be undertaken.
As used herein, "dioxinlike" includes all members of these
families of compounds and other compounds that induces the same
cellular effects. TCDD came to scientific and public attention
in the early 1970s in connection with the use of
2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) derivatives as
herbicides and defoliants, notably through
