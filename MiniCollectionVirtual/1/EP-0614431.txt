<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible sea anchor or drogue (50) having first and second hollow frusto-conical body parts (74, 80) which are made from strong flexible material, such as canvas. Four flexible lines (60, 62, 64, 66) connect the two body parts (74, 80) together and to a nose portion (52) to which a towing line can be connected. The sea anchor or drogue (50) is very effective in that the drag is large having regard to the diameter of the body parts (74, 80) and, moreover, it can be compactly stored when in a collapsed condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COLLAPSIBLE SEA ANCHOR OR DROGUEThis invention relates to an improved drogue or sea-anchor.A device of this general description is described and illustrated in United States Patent No. 4,969,413 and has a hollow rigid body for towing behind a vessel by a hawser connected to the leading end of the body. While this device functions satisfactorily there is a need for a device which can be compactly stored and is preferably lightweight.An object of the invention is to provide a collapsible sea anchor or drogue.According to the present invention there is provided a collapsible sea anchor or drogue comprising: a first body portion which in an operative position has a hollow frusto-conical shape; a second body portion which in an operative position has a hollow frusto-conical shape; towing line coupling means for coupling a towing line thereto; means for interconnecting the first body portion, the second body portion and the towing line coupling means such that the towing line coupling means is located forwardly of a narrower end of the first body portion and the second body portion is located adjacent to a wider end of the first body portion with a wider end of the second body located adjacent to said wider end of the first body; characterised in that at least one of said first and second body portions is collapsible when in a non-operative position.Preferably, both of said first and second body portions are collapsible when in non-operative positions.Preferably said first and second body portions are made from flexible material. 

 Preferably the material comprises canvas or fabric.Embodiments of the invention are shown, by way of illustrative example only, i the accompanying drawings, wherein: Figure 1 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment of the invention;Figure 2 is a fragmentary view of the embodiment of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a front view of the embodiment of Figure 1; Figure 4 is a fragmentary view of part of the embodiment of Figure 1; Figure 5 is a fragmentary view of an alternative embodiment; and Figure 6 is a fragmentary view of a further alternative embodiment.The drogue or sea anchor 50 of the invention includes a nose portion 52 whic has vanes formed in a cruciform form shape so as to function as a paravane. The nos portion can be fabricated or moulded from metal or plastics material. The portion 5 includes a triangular plate 54 which forms a vane which would normally lie in a vertica plane. The portion 52 includes laterally extending vanes 56 which would normally li in horizontal

6. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 including rings (68,70,72,78) located at the ends of the first and second body portions (74,76). 


 7. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein there i a gap between the wider ends of the first and second body portions, said gap definin water outlets (82) for discharging in use water generally laterally of the sea anchor o drogue.
8. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein th narrower end of the second body portion (76) is closed.
9. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 including vane (54,56,90,92,94,96) for imparting directional stability to the sea anchor or drogue as i is towed through water.
10. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in claim 9 wherein the vanes (54,56) ar located on a nose body (52) which incorporates said coupling means (58).
11. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in claim 9 wherein vanes (90,92,94,96) ar located within the first body portion (74).
12. A sea anchor or drogue as claimed in claim 11 wherein the vanes are formed fro perpendicular panels of fabric (90,92,94,96) connected within the first body portion or th second body portion.
