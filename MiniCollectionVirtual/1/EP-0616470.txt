System for transmitting digital television signals,
comprising a channel encoder (1) and comprising a channel

modulator (2, 3, 4, 5) at the transmitter end, and also
comprising a channel demodulator (7, 8, 9, 10) and a

channel decoder (11) at the reception end, items of
information (I1) relating to the reliability of the channel

demodulation being acquired in the channel demodulator (7,
8, 9, 10) and said items of information (I1) being fed to

the channel decoder (11), characterized in that the channel
decoder (11) is a Reed-Solomon decoder, in that the items

of information (I1) relating to the reliability of the
channel demodulation are erasure flags which are fed to the

Reed-Solomon decoder as items of information (I) relating
to possible error locations, and in that an erasure flag is

generated if the distance (a) from a reception symbol to
the nearest element of a modulation alphabet used in the

channel modulator (2, 3, 4, 5) is greater than a specified
threshold value (a
s
).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
items of information (I1) relating to a possible error

location are used in addition to the assignment of a
reception symbol to the nearest element of the modulation

alphabet used in the channel modulator (2, 3, 4, 5).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
assignment is carried out using a table which is stored at

the reception end and which contains items of information
relating to the modulation alphabet used in the channel

modulator (2, 3, 4, 5).
System according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that the threshold value (a
s
) is optimized
according to statistical criteria.
System according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that the items of information (I1) 
relating to the reliability of the channel demodulation are

taken from a read-only memory table.
Device for receiving digital television signals,
comprising a channel demodulator (7, 8, 9, 10) and a

channel decoder (11), items of information (I1) relating to
the reliability of the channel demodulation being acquired

in the channel demodulator (7, 8, 9, 10) and said items of
information (I1) being fed to the channel decoder (11),

characterized in that the channel decoder (11) is a Reed-Solomon
decoder, in that the items of information (I1)

relating to the reliability of the channel demodulation are
erasure flags which are fed to the Reed-Solomon decoder as

items of information (I) relating to possible error
locations, and in that an erasure flag is generated if the

distance (a) from a reception symbol to the nearest element
of a modulation alphabet used in the channel modulator (2,

3, 4, 5) is greater than a specified threshold value (a
s
).
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that the
channel demodulator (7, 8, 9, 10) furthermore comprises

means for assigning a reception symbol to the nearest
element of the modulation alphabet used in a channel

modulator (2, 3, 4, 5), which means are connected on the
input side to the means for generating items of information

(I1) relating to the reliability of the channel
demodulation.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in that the
means for assigning a reception symbol to the nearest

element of the modulation alphabet used in the channel
modulator comprise a memory in which items of information

relating to the modulation alphabet are stored.
Device according to one or more of Claims 6 to 8,
characterized in that the means for generating items of

information (I1) relating to possible error locations 
comprise a computation circuit for calculating the distance

from a reception symbol to the nearest element of the
modulation alphabet and a comparator which checks whether

the calculated distance is greater than a specified
threshold value or not.
Device according to one or more of Claims 6 to 9,
characterized in that the means for generating items of

information (I1) relating to possible error locations
contain a read-only table from which the appropriate

nearest element of the modulation alphabet and the
information relating to possible error locations can be

taken for any received symbol.
