<ABSTRACT>
In a stoppage period of the nuclear reactor, the head of the vessel having been removed and the vessel (3) and the pool of the reactor having been filled with water, an internal zone of the penetration tube (6), for the bottom head of the vessel (3), is isolated between two seals (39, 42), this operation being carried out from the upper level of the pool and under water. An electrolyte is made to flow into the isolated zone inside the penetration tube (6) and a current is made to pass through the electrolyte in order to deposit a metal layer of electroplating on the internal surface of the penetration tube (6) in the isolated zone. The metal layer is preferably a nickel layer having a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. The device comprises a hollow electroplating rod (cane) (25) carried by a pole (14) and connected via a set of pipes and cables (24) to an electroplating module arranged at the upper level of the reactor pool.

reactor, the generally cylindrical vessel (3) being 

disposed with its axis vertical in a vessel well (2) with 
its upper end opening in a tank (4), and including a 

cover and a rounded base (3a) through which a plurality 
of substantially vertical tubes (6) extends, each tube 

being connected to an instrument room (5) of the reactor 
by a measurement conduit (7) for the passage of a 

measurement probe into the core (8) of the reactor which 
is disposed in the vessel (3), characterized in that, 

during a shutdown period of the nuclear reactor, when the 
cover of the vessel (3) as well as the upper and lower 

internal equipment of the vessel (3) have been removed 
and the vessel (3) and the tank (4) are filled with 

water, the following steps are carried out from the top 
(11) of the tank (4) and under water, 


the positioning of a pole (14), including a guide 
conduit (15) along its length and a joining piece (16) at 

one of its ends, in a vertical arrangement inside the 
vessel (3) so that the joining piece (16) comes to rest 

on the upper end of the through tube (6) of the base of 
the vessel (3a), the guide conduit (15) being disposed as 

an axial extension of the through tube (6) of the base 
(3a) of the vessel, 
the introduction of an electrolytic coating rod (25) 
connected to an electrolysis module (30) by means of a 

set of supply cables and conduits (24) and comprising a  
 

tubular electrode (40) inserted between two remote-controlled, 
radially expandable, seals (39, 42), into the 

through tube (6), by means of the guide conduit (15) and 
of the joining piece (16), as far an operating region 

inside the through tube (6), having a defined length and 
position in the through tube (6), 
the isolation of the operating region inside the tube 
(6) by the expansion of the remote-controlled,expandable 

seals (39, 42) of the electrolytic coating rod (20), 
the filling of the isolated region with an electrolyte, 
and 
the supply of electric current to the tubular electrode

through the electrolyte and to deposit a metallic 
electrolytic coating layer on the internal surface of the 

tube (6) in the isolated region. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
electrolyte is circulated in the isolated region inside 

the through tube (6).

active agent of the electrolyte is constituted by nickel 

sulphamate.  
 
Method according to any one of Claims 3 and 4,
