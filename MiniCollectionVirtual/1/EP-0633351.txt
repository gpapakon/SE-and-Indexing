<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for recycling waste corrugated paperboard to produce a cellulose fiber pulp and recover energy and chemical values.Paperboard, including corrugated paperboard,
is widely used in packaging; millions of tons
of used paperboard are discarded annually, and more
than 70% of such discarded waste in Canada goes to
landfill sites.Processes have been proposed to recycle at
least a portion of such waste paperboard primarily
for use with virgin pulp. Prior processes involve
cleaning to remove non-wood contaminants and re-pulping
to form a brownstock which is then mixed with
virgin pulp for making linerboard or corrugating
medium for use in corrugated paperboard.The quality of the re-pulped fibers is
lower than that of comparable virgin pulp fibers and
thus it is usual to use the re-pulped fibers only in
admixture with higher quality virgin fibers, or to
employ chemical additives such as resin or starch to
compensate for the inferior quality of the re-pulped
fibers. The inferior quality of re-pulped fibers as
compared with comparable virgin pulp fibers arises
from the processing to which the fibers were subjected
during the original paperboard manufacture, and
also to aging in the paper product. In US-A- 4,737,238 recycling of
waste paper containing aluminum is described in which
an aqueous pulp suspension of the waste paper is
screened and then dewatered to produce a white water
stream containing most of the aluminum, whereafter
the pulp is subjected to oxygen delignification. In
CA-A-1,110,411 waste paperboard which
contains wax and resin is re-pulped by immersing it
in a weak sulphate black liquor at a temperature of
65 to 94째C (150 to 200째F) to produce defiberization of the waste
and separation of wax and resins from the fibers.Delignification, when used on unbleached
pulps to reduce their lignin fraction, is known to
simultaneously degrade the cellulose fraction. This
undesirable cellulose degradation is also known to be
responsible for the observed loss in the pulp
viscosity and has usually dictated how low in kappa
the pulp can. be delignified while maintaining a
minimum viscosity/strength for making papers.The strength of fully bleached pulps, used
on commercial paper machines to process these fine
paper grades has to be very high. For these pulps, a
TAPPI viscosity of at least 10 cps is usually the
minimum requirement to operate the paper machine with
good efficiency and to produce papers with
satisfactory strength.In published Japanese Paper Specifications

A process for recycling corrugated paperboard to produce
a bleachable cellulose fiber pulp and recover energy and

chemical values, comparising the steps of:

i) re-pulping and cleaning old corrugated containers
having a kappa number cf 80 to 120 and recovering a

paperboard pulp of cellulosic fibers,
ii) digesting said pulp from step i) in an aqueous alkaline cooking
liquor containing only sodium hydroxide as active cooking chemical or

additionally at least one of sodium sulphide and anthraquinone at a
temperature of 160째C to 180째C to effect a delignification of these

cellulose fibers in said paperboard pulp and produce a brownstock of a
delignified cellulosic pulp and spent liquor, said delignified pulp having

a kappa number of 15 to 40, a viscosity of above 10 cps and comprising
fibers of a quality such that the pulp when bleached can be employed as the

sole pulp in white paper product manufacture,

brownstock pulp and a brownstock washing liquor containing

inorganic chemicals derived from said cooking liquor during
the digesting in step ii), and combustible organic substances

formed during the digesting in step ii),
iv) separating the washed brownstock pulp from the
brownstock washing liquor,
v) recovering said washed brownstock pulp,
vi) concentrating at least a portion of the brownstock
washing liquor from step iv) to produce a concentrate,
