<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser system for a laser ablation
process and a laser ablation process for preparing a superconducting thin
film by utilizing the laser system, and more specifically to a laser system
suitable for laser ablation process and a laser ablation process for
preparing a superconducting thin film formed of an oxide superconductor
material by utilizing the laser system.There are many processes for preparing thin films in which laser
ablation processes have features that compositions of thin films can be
easily controlled and that thin films can be deposited at high rate.The laser ablation process is one of physical film deposition
processes in which a target is exposed to a laser beam in a hermetic
chamber which can be evacuated and into which arbitrary gasses can be
supplied. A substrate is disposed to oppose the target in the chamber.
When the target is exposed to the laser beam, a flame like plasma called
plume is generated and a thin film is deposited on the substrate near a tip 
of the plume. High energy lasers such as excimer lasers or CO2 lasers are
used for the laser ablation.Such a process is described in the document EP-A-0 499 805. This
document more particularly relates to a deposit of a thin film having more
than one component and it discloses that there are as many laser beams as
targets, each target being used for each component.Since no electromagnetic field which affects charged particles is
needed, the laser ablation processes are suitable for preparing high quality
thin films.High critical temperature oxide superconductors recently advanced
in study are plural compound oxides and their superconducting properties
are significantly lowered if compositions deviate from proper values.As mentioned above, compositions of thin films are easily
controlled if the thin films are deposited by laser ablation processes.
Therefore, it is studied to deposit oxide superconductor thin films having
excellent properties by laser ablation processes.In order to deposit high quality thin films by the laser ablation
process, the laser beam should have identical intensity among each lot and
from the beginning to the end of each process. If the intensity of the laser
beam changes during the laser ablation process, a non-uniform thin film
may be deposited. Space intensity distribution of the laser beam is also
important. It is desired that the space intensity distribution of the laser
beam is unchanged.However, beam intensity of gas lasers such as excimer lasers
gradually lower, when
