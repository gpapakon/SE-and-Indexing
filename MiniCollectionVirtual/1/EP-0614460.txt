<DESCRIPTION>
 β-1,3-GLUCAN POLYSACCHARIDES, COMPOSITIONS, AND THEIR PREPARATION AND USESThis invention relates to ø-l,3-glucan polysaccharides, compositions containing them, methods for their preparation, and their uses.A number of patents and technical articles have been published on 0-1,3-glucan polysaccharides.For example, the article "Properties of Gels Formed by Heat Treatment of Curdlan, a Bacterial -1,3-Glucan", Maeda et al., Aσr. Biol. Chem.. Vol. 31, No. 10. 1184-1188, 1967, investigated the nature of its gel formation when heated in aqueous suspension, including a finding that the presence of borate increased gel strength, while the addition of other salts did not, and a study of the effect of pH on gel strength. It was also found that the addition of urea caused a decrease in the gel-forming temperature.U.S. 4,774,093 discloses the preparation of £-1,3- glucan polysaccharide gels by dissolving a £-l,3-glucan polysaccharide in an aqueous alkaline medium at a temperature of 55°C or less, and while maintaining the resulting solution at a temperature of at least 50°C, but not more than 60°C, adjusting the pH to 10.0 or lower. The resulting gel has a coherent, uniform, non- particulate structure with a substantially uniform pH. The gel is used for supporting, separating, transforming or treating biological materials, as release coatings or carriers for pharmaceuticals, as edible gels, for use in toothpaste, as a gel coating for biological materials, and as a disposable contact lens.U.S. 4,012,333 discloses a method for the production of gels from a £-l,3-glucan-type polysaccharide by exposing a basic solution of the 

 polysaccharide to an atmosphere of a gaseous acid anhydride, such as carbon dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen and sulfur.U.S. 4,950,749 relates to a process for the recovery of a nonionic water soluble glucan by the addition of a divalent cation to a solution of solubilized glucan, followed by the adjustment of the solution to an alkaline pH to precipitate the glucan. The water soluble glucans include scleroglucans and schizophyllans.European published patent application No. 0 367 391 discloses the production of linear curdlan gels by heating aqueous suspensions of curdlan at a temperature of >85°C through small diameter tubes. The gels are useful as food materials. Blends of curdlan with seaweed extracts and the like are also disclosed.U.S. 5,002,669 discloses the use of 1,3-glucan and derivatives thereof to separate racemic mixtures, for the separation of geometrical isomers, and for the
