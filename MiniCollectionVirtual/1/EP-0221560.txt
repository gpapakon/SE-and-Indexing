<ABSTRACT>
Optical radiation can be efficiently removed from, or in­
jected into, single mode optical fiber at an intermediate point 

along the fiber, by causing quasi-resonant coupling of the gui­
ded mode LP₀₁ to an appropriate tunneling leaky (TL) mode, 

e.g., LP₁₁. Such coupling is caused by means of a "grating" in 
the fiber, with the grating being formed by impressing a per­

iodic (or pseudo-periodic) modulation on the fiber, or by caus­
ing a periodic (or pseudo-periodic) variation of the refractive 

index of the fiber by means of the photoelastic or the photo­
refractive effect. The nominal grating spacing ∧(z) is chosen 

such that
 

ο
o
 = (2π/) 
>
 β₀₁-2πn
cl
∧
o
, where  is the average grat­
ing spacing, β₀₁ is the propagation constant of the LP₀₁ mode, 

n
cl
 is the refractive index of the fiber cladding, and 
o
 is the 
wavelength of the radiation to be coupled from or into the 

fiber. Furthermore, ∧(z) is to be chosen such that
 

ο
o
 β₀₁ - β
rs
 where β
rs
 is the propagation constant of the 
selected TL mode. In order for the coupling to be quasi-­

resonant, it is necessary that α
rs
, the attenuation constant of 
the selected TL mode, be relatively small, typically 
<
 1 dB/cm. 
By appropriately choosing ∧(z) and/or the amplitude function 

of the grating, it is possible to increase the coupling efficiency 
above what is possible with a constant spacing, constant 

amplitude grating. Devices according to the invention can be 
advantageously used not only as radiation couplers but also 

as filters and, if they are of the photorefractive type, as ampli­
tude modulators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to devices for 
coupling optical power from and/or into optical fiber, 
and to optical fiber communication systems comprising 
such devices. Optical communications has undergone very 
rapid development, to the point where optical fiber 
transmission systems are becoming almost commonplace. 
Optical fiber is not only used for trunk (i.e., long-haul) 
applications, but also to transfer information 
over short distances, e.g., in local area networks, and 
potentially, in the subscriber loop. In many applications it is necessary, or at 
least desirable, to inject optical power into a 
fiberguide at intermediate locations, and/or to extract 
optical power from the fiberguide at such locations, 
without the need for breaking or terminating the 
fiberguide, and without requiring special preparation of 
the coupling point in the fiberguide. Such couplers 
have been known in the art for some time. See, for 
instance U.S. Patent 3,931,518, ('518), which teaches a 
particular embodiment of a coupler type which will 
herein be referred to as a "grating" coupler. The '518 patent teaches that optical power can 
be coupled from an optical fiber by impressing a 
periodic deformation onto the fiber, with the 
periodicity of the deformation chosen such as to induce 
coupling between appropriate modes of radiation. In 
this fashion power can be transferred resonantly from 
lower to higher order guided or bound modes, and  
 
nonresonantly from the higher bound modes to the so-called 
tunneling leaky (TL) modes, which are then 
removed from the cladding of the fiberguide with the aid 
of a dielectric body that is in contact with the 
fiberguide at a point downstream from the periodic 
deformation region and which has a refractive index 
which is approximately equal to or greater than the 
index of refraction of the cladding. For an exposition of the relevant theory, see, 
for instance, D. Marcuse, TheoryofDielectricOpticalWaveguides, 
Academic Press, 1974, especially pages 95-157. 
Briefly, it can be shown that it is possible to 
provide a coupling mechanism in multimode fiber such 
that the 
(i, j)'th and (p, q)'th bound modes are coupled to 
produce complete energy exchange over a coupling 
length 
Lc = π/Rij,pq 
, where the coupling constant Rij,pq 
depends upon fiber parameters such as the core radius, 
the refractive index difference between core and 
cladding, the operating wavelength, the fiber profile 
shape, and, in a coupler as disclosed in '518, on the 
amplitude of the distortion of the
