<ABSTRACT>
The audio output equipment includes a portion 
(15) for receiving a control signal which indicates 

which one of a speech and tones is to be generated, and 
which is indicative of a gain for the one to be 

generated; a portion (15) for receiving an input signal 
including speech information; a speech data processing 

portion (S2) for processing the input signal to produce 
the speech data in accordance with the control signal 

when the speech is to be generated; a frequency 
selection portion (S10, S16) for selecting one or more 

frequencies corresponding to the kind of one of the 
tones in accordance with the control signal when the one 

tone is to be generated; a frequency table for storing 
data corresponding to the frequencies; a data extracting 

portion (S23) for extracting from the frequency table 
the data corresponding to the one or more frequencies 

selected by the frequency selection portion (S10, S16); 
a key validation sound data generation portion (S24) for 

generating key validation sound data on the basis of the 
data extracted by the data extracting portion (S23); a 

gain control processing portion (S4), to which either

portion (S2) and the output data from the key validation 
sound data generation portion (S24), for controlling the 

gain for the input data in accordance with the control 
signal; a digital-to-analog conversion portion (19) for 

converting the data from the gain control processing  
 

portion (S4) into an analog signal; and an acoustic 
element (22) for producing sound in response to the 

output signal which the digital-to-analog conversion 
portion (19) produces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to audio output
equipment, and particularly to an audio output equipment
suitable for use in digital land mobile portable
telephone.Fig. 2 shows a conventional audio output
equipment for use in digital land mobile portable
telephone. This audio output equipment includes a
digital signal processor 1, a D/A converter 3, an audio
analog switch 5, an audio gain control circuit 6, an
audio acoustic element 7, a sine wave generator 8, a key
validation sound analog switch 9, a key validation sound
gain circuit 10, a key validation sound acoustic element
11 and a control portion 12.In this audio output equipment shown in Fig.
2, a speech signal is produced as a digital audio signal
2 from the digital signal processor 1. This digital
audio signal 2 is supplied to the D/A converter 3, where
it is converted into an analog audio signal 4. This
analog audio signal 4 is supplied to the audio analog
switch 5 and then to the audio gain control circuit 6,
and the speech is reproduced from the audio acoustic
element 7. The key validation sound in DTMF or the like
is produced from the acoustic element 11 when a sine
wave signal from the sine wave generator 8 is supplied 
to the key validation sound acoustic element 11 through
the key validation analog switch 9 and the key
validation gain circuit 10.Generally in the portable telephone or the
like, when the speech is produced, the user hears the
speech with the telephone brought close to his ear, and
when the key validation sound is produced, the user
separates the telephone from the ear in order to make a
key operation. Therefore, the user must make different
operations for the production of the speech and the key
validation sound from the telephone, and the speech and
the key validation sound are not simultaneously
produced. Thus, a control signal 13 is produced from
the control portion 12, and controls the audio analog
switch 5 and the key validation sound analog switch 9 so
that either one of the speech and the key validation
sound is selected and produced.In addition, when the audio output level is
adjusted, a control signal 14 is produced from the
control portion and supplied to the audio gain control
circuit 6, thereby controlling its gain.In the conventional equipment shown in Fig. 2,
however, since the sine wave generator 8 and acoustic
element 11 special for the key validation sound are
provided, the number of the elements which constitute
the equipment is increased the more. In addition, since 
the gain control circuit is provided for the
