<ABSTRACT>
According to the method described, the used aircraft deicing fluid is first subjected to conventional filtration for separating off undissolved substances and then to an ultrafiltration for separating off, in particular, polymeric thickeners. The ultrafiltration permeate is further treated with ionic exchangers and water is then separated off by distillation from the eluate obtained essentially comprising glycol and water and thus the glycol level is brought to the desired value. A new aircraft deicing composition can be prepared with the glycol/water solution thus obtained by adding the additional necessary components to the glycol/water solution.

A process for the reclamation of used aircraft
deicing compositions based on glycols, which comprises


(1) initially filtering the used aircraft deicing
composition to remove the suspended

contaminants,
(2) subjecting the filtrate obtained in step (1) to
an ultrafiltration to remove the polymer

thickeners,
(3) treating the ultrafiltration permeate obtained
in step (2) with an anion exchanger and a

cation exchanger to remove salts and ionic
compounds which are present and
(4) distilling the solution obtained in step (3) to
remove excess water and thus adjust the glycol

content to the required value.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
ultrafiltration is carried out in such a way that

(2.1) an ultrafiltration membrane with a nominal
separation limit of 1000 to 500,000 is employed,

(2.2) the ultrafiltration membrane is composed of an
organic polymer or an inorganic material, (2.3)

tubular modules, capillary modules, plate modules or
spiral coil modules are employed as membrane

modules, (2.4) a pressure across the membrane of 2
to 10 bar is used, and (2.5) the process is carried

out at a temperature of 20 to 80°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
ultrafiltration is carried out in such a way that

(2.1) an ultrafiltration membrane with a nominal
separation limit of 100,000 to 300,000 is employed,

(2.2) the ultrafiltration membrane is composed of an
organic polymer or an inorganic material, (2.3)

tubular modules, capillary modules, plate modules or
spiral coil modules are employed as membrane

modules, (2.4) a pressure across the membrane of 3
to 6 bar is used, and (2.5) the process is carried

out at a temperature of 40 to 60°C.
The process as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein the
ultrafiltration membrane is composed of an organic

polymer from the group of polysulfones, polyethersulfones
and polyaramides.
The process as claimed in claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein
spiral coil modules are employed as membrane modules.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, wherein the ultrafiltration permeate is contacted

first with a cation exchanger and the outflow
therefrom is contacted with an anion exchanger.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, wherein the ultrafiltration permeate is contacted

first with a strongly acidic cation exchanger and
the outflow therefrom is contacted with a strongly

basic anion exchanger.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
7, wherein the solution obtained after the ion

exchanger treatment, essentially composed of glycol
and water, is distilled to remove water and, during

this, the glycol content in the solution is adjusted
to 40 to 80% by weight, percentages by weight based

on the solution.
