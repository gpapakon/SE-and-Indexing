<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the smelting reduction of ore or prereduced metalliferous materials which, being in the form of an emulsion of slag, liquid metal and coke particles floating thereon, coming from a smelting reduction reactor reach a settling vessel and are there converted, by blowing with oxygen, into pig iron having a low carbon content. In the process, the upper part of the settling vessel is injected with oxygen with a soft flame, the oxygen, via oxidation of the coke, increasing the volume of gas which flows into the smelting reduction reactor and forces back any coke particles floating on the emulsion. The invention also relates to the installation for this purpose.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of pig iron by smelt 
reduction of ores or pre-reduced metal carriers, 

wherein an emulsion of slag, molten metal and floating 
coke particles passes from a smelt reduction reactor 

via a connecting piece into a separate settling tank 
and is converted therein into pig iron having a low 

carbon content by blowing oxygen, characterised in that 
oxygen is injected with a soft jet into the upper 

section of the settling tank via lances in addition to 
the oxygen fed with a hard jet, with the additional 

oxygen blown on with a soft jet oxidising part of the 
floating coke and thereby increasing the quantity of 

gas, and the gas flowing into the smelt reduction 
reactor via the connecting piece and in so doing 

forcing coke particles floating on the emulsion back 
counter to the direction of flow of the emulsion. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that energy sources such as fuel gas, oil or coal dust 

are admixed to the soft oxygen jet. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the quantity of oxygen or of the oxygen/fuel 

mixture is set depending on the desired carbon content 
of the metal. 
An apparatus for producing pig iron according to 
the method of Claim 1, comprising a smelt reduction 

reactor having a shaft, which reactor is connected via 
a connecting piece to a settling tank, into the upper 

section of which oxygen top-blowing lances project, 
characterised in that at least one lance (38) which 

projects into the upper section of the settling tank 
(22) surrounds a lance (36), forming an annular gap  

 
(39), and that the base (17) of the connecting piece 

(16) has an angle of inclination (α) which drops 
towards the settling tank (20), which angle enables the 

emulsion of slag and molten metal to flow away. 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the annular gap (39) has connections (37, 42) 

for coupling to an oxygen supply station (32) and to a 
fuel supply station (41). 
An apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that the annular gap (39) is arranged concentrically 

to the oxygen lance (36). 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the angle of inclination (α) is of a size of 

3 - 12°.
