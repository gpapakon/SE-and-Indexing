<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus are provided for transferring a metered 
charge of granular material from a bulk source to an individual 

receptacle at high speed. The apparatus (10) comprises nozzle 
array (11), each having suction and positive ports, a screen 

disposed within the nozzle, and suction and positive pressure 
sources that selectively communicate with the suction and pressure 

ports to sequentially engage a charge of granular material from a 
bulk source (31) and then expel the charge of granular material 

into a receptacle in a receptacle transfer system (14). The 
apparatus includes a controller for selectively actuating valves 

connecting the suction and positive pressure ports to the suction 
and positive pressure sources.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a
method
according to claims 1 and 7 respectively,
for engaging a metered amount of granular
material from a bulk reservoir, transferring the
metered amount of material to a deposition site, and
disposing the granular material in a receptacle.The development of tobacco-less smoking
articles, such as those described in commonly assigned
U.S. Patent 4,966,171, required new automated methods
and apparatus for high speed production assembly. The
smoking article described in that patent includes a
heat source and an air-permeable tube containing a
granular material disposed adjacent to the heat source
for generating a tobacco flavored aerosol.One step in the assembly of that smoking
article is to engage a measured amount or charge of
aerosol-generating granular material from a bulk
reservoir and to transfer that material to the air-permeable
tube. Because the amount of granular
material disposed in the tube must be maintained within
precise ranges to achieve satisfactory performance, it
is important that the methods and apparatus developed
to accomplish this task work reliably and at high speed
to facilitate automated operation. Previously known devices for transferring
charges of particulate matter from a bulk source to
individual compartments are described in several prior
art patents, for example, Molins, U.S. Patent
3,570,557, Sexstone U.S. Patent 3,844,200, and
Washington et al., U.S. Patent 4,005,668. All of these
devices have in common the use of a rotating drum
having a having slot or pocket through which suction is
drawn to engage a charge of particulate matter from a
reservoir. When the drum rotates, the slot or pocket
registers with a target compartment, and the charge of
particulate material is drawn into the target
compartment using either suction applied at the base of
the compartment or positive pressure applied to the
charge of particulate matter to expel the charge of
material into the target compartment. None of these
previously known devices provides the capability to
transfer precisely metered amounts of particulate
matter to individual receptacles at target locations
with high accuracy and at high speed.DE-A-4200701 discloses an apparatus for transferring granular
material from a bed to a receptacle, the apparatus comprising a
nozzle, means for drawing up granular material from a bed and
discharging it into a receptacle, and means for translating the
nozzle.In view of the foregoing, it has been desired
to provide methods and apparatus
for
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for transferring granular material from
a bed of granular material to a receptacle (22), the apparatus

comprising:

a passageway (53), a suction port (54) communicating with
the passageway, a positive pressure port (55) communicating with

the passageway and an air permeable screen (57);
a pneumatic suction source (60) communicating with the
suction port;
a pneumatic positive pressure source (64) communicating
with the positive pressure port;
a first valve (62) disposed between the pneumatic suction
source and the suction port;
a second valve (63) disposed between the pneumatic
positive pressure source and the positive pressure port;
a controller (61) that selectively actuates the first and
second valves; and
means (12) for translating the passageway from a first
position where the controller selectively opens the first valve to

connect the pneumatic suction source to the suction port to induce
an airflow in the passageway to entrain a charge of granular

material from the bed of granular material and trap the charge of
granular material within the passageway against the air permeable

screen to a second position where the controller opens the second
valve to connect the pneumatic positive pressure source to the

positive pressure port to introduce a pulse of positive pressure
into the passageway so that the charge of granular material is

expelled into the receptacle,

characterised in that the passageway (53) terminates in
a nozzle (56), in that the air permeable screen (57 is disposed

within the passageway and in that the controller (61) closes the
first valve (62) through which suction is applied to the

passageway simultaneously with opening the second valve (63) 
through which positive pressure is applied to the passageway.
Apparatus (10) according to claim 1 further comprising
means (38) for removing an excess portion of granular material

from the charge of granular material so that the charge of
granular material has a desired volume.
Apparatus (10) according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the
means (12) for translating comprises a pick/place mechanism having

a slide (42) and the nozzle (56) is disposed from the slide.
Apparatus (10) according to any preceding claim further
comprising:


a pneumatic high positive pressure source (67)
communicating with the positive pressure port (55);
a third valve (66) disposed between the pneumatic high
positive pressure source and the positive pressure port, the third

valve selectively operated by the controller (61) to purge any
residue from the passageway (53) after the charge of granular

material is expelled into the receptacle.
Apparatus (10) according to any preceding claim wherein
the receptacle (22) is carried on a receptacle transfer system

(14), the apparatus further comprising a vacuum manifold (23)
disposed adjacent the receptacle transfer system to induce suction

through the receptacle, so that the charge of granular material
expelled from the passageway is captured in the receptacle (22).
Apparatus (10) according to any preceding claim further
comprising:


an endless belt conveyor (33);
a hopper (31) for storing a bulk reservoir of granular
material, the hopper including an opening that permits the

granular material to flow onto the endless belt conveyor at a 
uniform depth to form the bed of granular material;
a trough (36) disposed at one end of the endless belt
conveyor to collect the granular material as the endless belt

conveyor begins its return flight; and
means for transferring the granular material from the
trough to the hopper.
A method of transferring granular material from a bulk
reservoir to a receptacle (22) comprising:


providing a bed of granular material from the bulk
reservoir;
providing a passageway (53) terminating in a nozzle (56),

introducing the nozzle into the bed;
applying suction to the passageway and nozzle to draw the

granular material into the nozzle and passageway and trap it

granular material from a bulk reservoir of granular material;
c) translating the nozzle so that it enters the bed
of granular material;
d) creating an airflow through the suction port,
screen and passageway and nozzle by suction, the airflow

entraining a charge of granular material from the bed into the
nozzle and passageway and trapping the charge of granular material 

against the air permeable screen;
e) displacing the nozzle through a series of
translations from the bed of granular material to a position

located adjacent the receptacle, while maintaining the airflow
through the suction port, screen, passageway and nozzle; and
f) admitting a pulse of low positive pressure into the
positive pressure port and passageway while simultaneously ceasing

the airflow through the suction port, screen, passageway and
nozzle, so that the pulse of positive pressure expels the charge

of granular material from the nozzle into the receptacle.
A method according to claim 7 or 8 further comprising
drawing suction through the receptacle (22) during the step of

admitting the pulse of low positive pressure into the positive
pressure port (55) to assist transfer of the charge of granular

material from the nozzle (56) to the receptacle.
