<ABSTRACT>
A conche having at least two rotors (6, 7, 10, 10') which are respectively arranged in a trough compartment (3, 4, 5) of a conching trough (1), the trough walls (2, 15, 115) of the conching trough (1) being arranged so as to closely enclose each rotor (6, 7, 10, 10'). At least one (6, 7) of the rotors (6, 7, 10, 10') has radially projecting vanes (8) and at least one further rotor takes the form of a cutting rotor (10, 10') with at least one cutting edge (12).

Conch with at least three rotors (6, 7, 10, 10') which
are arranged in each case in a trough compartment of a conch

trough and of which at least one rotor (6, 7) is provided with
radially projecting vanes (8, 9), trough walls of the conch

trough being arranged so as to surround each rotor closely
over a portion of its periphery, characterised in that at

least one of the rotors is a shearing rotor which extends
substantially parallel to the other two rotors and is designed

as a knife rotor (10, 10') with at least one cutting edge (11)
or as a worm rotor and in that a rotor of this type is also

provided as fourth rotor, these rotors preferably each being
provided with their own drive (14).
Conch according to claim 1, characterised in that at
leas
t one shearing rotor (10, 10') is arranged on the
underside of the trough, preferably sunken relative to the

other respective trough compartment (3, 4), preferably in a
trough compartment (4, 4') arranged deeper in the conch trough

(1) with respect to the overall height than the trough
compartment (3, 5) for the at least one rotor (6, 7) equipped

with vanes (8) and optionally also with scraping and rubbing
tools (9).
Conch according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the trough compartment (4, 4') for the knife rotor (10, 10')

arranged deeper in the conch trough (1), in particular with
respect to overall height, is open in design on one

longitudinal side - in particular upwardly in the direction of
one or more higher trough compartments (3, 5) of the rotor (6,

7) equipped with vanes (8). 
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a sharp cutting edge (11) is formed on a

worn helix (12) of the knife rotor (10, 10') and in that the
cutting edge (11) of the worm helix (12) is preferably

arranged so as to extend over its periphery.
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that cutting tools are provided between the

threads of the worm helix (12) which extend substantially
radially to the axis thereof, for example project radially,

and in that the worm helix (12) is preferably interrupted at
least at one point (13) to form radially extending cutting

edges.
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the rotor (6, 7) with radially

projecting vanes (8) is provided with scraping and rubbing
tools (9) which are uninterrupted substantially over the

length of the trough and extend to the trough wall (2).
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the worn helix (12) has a different

pitch and in that the distance between the worn helix threads
preferably decreases gradually in the direction of the

interior of the conch trough (1).
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that at least one knife rotor (10, 10') or

the associated trough compartment (4, 4') extends merely over
a proportion of the overall length of the conch trough (1) and

in that the trough compartment (4, 4') of the knife rotor (10,
10') in the interior of the conch trough (1) and opposite its

end wall is preferably closed by a transverse wall (15) or
transverse wall (115) which is respectively perpendicular or

inclined relative to the rotor axis and is preferably also
provided for the mounting of the worm rotor (10, 10'). 
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the length of the knife rotor (10, 10')

is at least a quarter, at most half, preferably a third of the
overall length of the conch trough (1) and/or the speed of the

worn or knife rotor is at least 1000 revolutions per minute,
preferably 1500 to 3000 revolutions per minute.
Conch according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a plurality of worms and/or knife rotors

(10, 10') is arranged within the trough and in that preferably
at least one of the following features is provided:


a) at least two rotors are axially opposed;
b) at least two rotors are provided next to one another in
parallel, in particular in an intermeshing manner;
c) the trough compartments (4, 4') of at least two worm
rotors (10, 10') open upwardly into the trough compartments

(3, 5) of the rotors (6, 7) equipped with vanes (8);
d) the axes of at least two, preferably all rotors (6, 7,
10, 10') are arranged at least substantially parallel to one

another;
e) a preferably common motor drive system (14) is provided
for at least two, in particular for all, rotors (6, 7, 10,

10'), the proposed direction of rotation of at least one rotor
(6, 7) equipped with vanes (8) and preferably with scraping

and rubbing tools (9) being that which conveys the chocolate
mass from above to the trough compartment (4, 4') of at least

one worm or knife rotor (10, 10');
f) a preferably common motor drive system (14) is provided
for at least two, in particular for all, rotors (6, 7, 10,

10'), the proposed direction of rotation of at least one rotor 
(6, 7) equipped with vanes (8) and preferably with scraping

and rubbing tools (9) being that which carries off the
chocolate mass issuing from the trough compartment (4, 4') of

at least one worm or knife rotor (10, 10').
