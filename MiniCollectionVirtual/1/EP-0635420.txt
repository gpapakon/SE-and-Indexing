<ABSTRACT>
A winching device comprises a casing (65), a pulley (40) rotatably 
mounted on the support (65) and having a cable (21) secured thereto for 

wrapping and unwrapping about the pulley on rotation thereof, and 
pulley actuating means (53). The device further comprises a shroud 

(70) in the form of a sleeve encircling the pulley (40) so as to contain 
the cable (21) on the pulley, the shroud having a cable entry aperture 

(72) for the through passage of the cable and a pawl aperture receiving 
a pawl (74) therein, the pawl being biased towards the hub of the pulley 

to assist in containing the cable on the pulley. The shroud is easily 
mounted on a casing pin (61) and the pulley is dropped into the shroud 

in order to align the cable-receiving channel of the pulley with the pawl 
aperture and cable entry aperture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a winching device particularly, but not 
exclusively, for a vehicle spare wheel carrying assembly. In some vehicles it is usual to support a spare wheel beneath the body 
of the vehicle. The spare wheel is held, in a stowed position, with the 
tyre pressed against formations of the body, by means of a winching 
device holding a support cable for the spare wheel under tension. The 
winching device can be operated, by means of a detachable handle, for 
example to lower the spare wheel on the cable to an accessible position. 
The winching device includes a pulley on which the cable is mounted. Such a winching device is disclosed in GB-A-2251589. In this device 
the pulley is mounted in a rectangular support casing. It has been 
found that when there is no load on the cable the inherent resilience of 
the cable results in at least some turns thereof expanding and filling the 
gap between the pulley and the support casing with the result that the 
cable can become tangled with itself and/or adjacent components so that 
subsequent operation of the winching device is impaired. US-A-4915358, US-A-4059197 and GB-A-1432823 all relate to a gear 
mechanism for a spare wheel winch. US-A-4997164 discloses a spare wheel winch in which a plate-like 
member extends over approximately half of the circumference of a 
winch cable pulley. In this way, 180° of the pulley channel in which 
the cable is received is covered by the plate-like member. The 
remainder of the pulley is left uncovered, so that the winch cable is free 
to expand to fill the space between the uncovered part of the pulley and  
 
the winch housing when the cable is load-free. EP-A-507032 discloses a frame-like housing in a spare wheel winch, 
wherein the housing has an approximately 90° arcuate part that is 
concentric with a cable-receiving channel in the winch pulley. The 
housing does not, however, close any part of the channel, so that the cable 
is free to expand to fill the gap between the pulley and the housing when 
there is no load on the cable. A stop pawl is provided for preventing 
rotation of the pulley when the cable has been unwound. The pawl is 
retracted away from the channel during winding and unwinding of the 
cable, so that the pawl does not function to prevent expansion of the cable 
when the cable is load-free. US-E-33303 discloses a spare wheel winch having a pulley comprising two 
circular, parallel side plates with a smaller circular hub plate clamped 
therebetween to form a cable-receiving channel
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A winching device comprising a casing having first and second 
parts (65,27) secured together by pins (61-64), a pulley (40) rotatably 

mounted in the casing and having a peripheral channel (43) around a hub 
(18) and defined between channel sidewalls (41,42); a cable (21) secured 

to the pulley for wrapping and unwrapping about the hub (18) within the 
channel on rotation of the pulley; drive means (45,46,50,51,53) for 

rotating the pulley; a shroud (70) and a pawl (74) both mounted in the 
casing for containing the cable in the channel, the pawl being pivotally 

biased towards the hub; and a guide (72) for guiding the cable into the 
channel, characterised in that the shroud (70) is in the form of a sleeve 

encircling the pulley (40), the shroud having a cable entry aperture (72) 
defining the guide and a second aperture (73) receiving the pawl (74) 

therein, the shroud being located relative to the pawl (74) and the channel 
(43) by engagement on said pin or one of said pins (61-64). 
A winching device according to claim 1 wherein the pawl is 
pivotally mounted to said pin or one of sid pins (61-64). 
A winching device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the pawl is 
engagable with the hub (18) to prevent rotation of the pulley once the 

cable has been substantially unwrapped therefrom. 
A winching device according to any preceding claim, wherein the 
pawl (74) is engageable with the casing (65) to limit the movement of the 

pawl away from the pulley hub (18). 
A winching device according to claim 4, wherein, in said limit 
position, the pawl (74) has an arcuate surface (75) facing the cable and  

 
forming a continuation of the shroud inner surface. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein the shroud is 
moulded from a synthetic plastics material. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein the pulley (40) 
is a one-piece construction and has a recess (17b) extending through both 

sidewalls (41,42), at least one of the sidewalls including a slot (17a) 
communicating with the recess (17b), the recess having a larger cross-sectional 

area than the slot, the slot receiving the cable and the recess 
journally receiving a nipple (19) attached to the cable.
