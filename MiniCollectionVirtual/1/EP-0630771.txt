<ABSTRACT>
The suspension comprises a lower arm (14) articulated 
to the body (18) and to the wheel hub (8), and a strut (2) 

which is articulated to the body (18) and to the wheel 
hub (8) and has a limb (10). The arm (14) and the 

limb (10) are connected by means of a plate-like arm 
carrying bushes (28, 30) at its ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to front suspensions for 
motor vehicles, particularly suspensions of the 
MacPherson type which are fitted in vehicles having 
front-wheel drive and are constituted by a strut and a 
lower transverse arm both connected to the wheel hub. Suspensions as described above are not suitable for 
controlling the camber angle; in particular, they do 
not enable the camber angle to be controlled throughout 
the travel of the wheel, so that it tends to open out 
progressively downwardly as it rises gradually towards 
the body of the car. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
MacPherson front suspension for front-wheel-drive 
vehicles which prevents the aforesaid problem and is 
easy to construct and cheap. A further object of the present invention is to provide 
a suspension as described above which is completely 
interchangeable with a conventional suspension without 
alteration of the body. These objects are achieved by means of a MacPherson 
suspension having the specific characteristics recited 
in the following claims. The invention will now be described with reference to 
the appended drawings, provided purely by way of 
non-limiting example, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the suspension of the 
invention, and Figure 2 is a sectional view of a portion of Figure 1. With reference to Figures 1 and 2, a shock-absorber 
with a coaxial spring is schematically indicated 2 and 
a substantially inverted-L-shaped arm 4 is fixed to the 
body of the shock-absorber, the first limb 6 of the arm 
4 being articulated to the wheel hub 8 and its second 
limb 10 having a through-hole 11 at its end. First ends of a lower arm 14 are articulated to the 
chassis 18 of the motor-vehicle (not shown) in known 
manner, for example, by means of two bushes 16 and 16b, 
and its second end 20 is articulated to the wheel hub 
8. Approximately in the central region of the lower arm 14, 
between the bush 16 and the end 20, the two cheeks of 
the lower arm 14 have through-holes for housing a bolt, the 
function of which will be explained below. The ends of an intermediate plate-shaped arm 26 carry bushes 28 and 
30 for connection to the second limb 10 and the lower arm 14, 
respectively. The bush 28 is connected to the lower arm 14 in 
correspondence with through-holes in the cheeks of the 
arm and is fixed to the arm with the use of a bolt 32 
and a nut 34. The bush 30 is connected to the second limb 10, for example, 
with the use of nuts 36 and 38 on a pin (not shown) 
which is
