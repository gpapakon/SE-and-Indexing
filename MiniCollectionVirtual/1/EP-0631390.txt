<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power semiconductor circuit comprising an insulated gate field
effect power semiconductor device, a gate control circuit for controlling the
application of voltages to the insulated gate electrode of the power semiconductor
device, and a fault detection circuit for switching off the power semiconductor
device when an abnormal condition is detected.US-A-4928053 describes a power semiconductor device circuit in which the power
semiconductor device is an n-channel power MOSFET intended to be used as a high-side
switch for an inductive load. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, a
'high-side switch' in the case of an n-channel device is a switch which is coupled
between the load and the more positive of the two voltage supply lines. In the circuit
described in US-A-4928053, a voltage clamping circuit in the form of a zener diode is
coupled between the positive voltage supply terminal to which one main electrode of the
power semiconductor device is coupled and the gate electrode of the power
semiconductor device. The main current path, that is the current path between its main
electrodes, of an n-channel MOS transistor is coupled between the gate and the other
main electrode of the power semiconductor device. The gate electrode of the n-channel
MOST is coupled together with the gate electrode of a p-channel MOST to the other
supply line which is, as shown, at ground. The main current path of the p-channel MOS
transistor is coupled between the gate electrode of the power MOSFET and a gate drive
circuit. In operation of the circuit described in US-A-4928053 when an overvoltage
occurs due to the switching of the inductive load, the zener diode breaks down and the
n-channel MOS transistor provides a conduction path, bypassing the power
semiconductor device, for dissipation of the energy in the inductive load. At the same
time, the p-channel MOS is switched off so isolating the power MOSFET from the gate
drive circuit. Published Abstract 1-082708 of JP-A-64-82708 in the Patent Abstracts
of Japan discloses a MOSFET driving circuit designed to enable fast switching
operation by the provision of parallel branch networks of diodes and resistances
in a gate circuit of the MOSFET. The diodes are so arranged that different
paths through the network are used when switching on and when switching off
the MOSFET. Fast switching of the diodes occurs with reverse recovery values
according to the direction of charge flow and the switched resistance value.Published German patent
