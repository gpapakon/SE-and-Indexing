<CLAIMS>
Use, as active compounds, of hydroxy- or dihydroxynaphthalenes 
for the preparation of a cosmetic or 

dermatological composition having a depigmenting action, 
characterized by the fact that the said compounds 

correspond to the following formula: 

 
in which:
 
R
1
 to R
4
 represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl radical, 
at least one and at most two of the radicals R
1
 to R
4
 
representing a hydroxyl radical, with the exception of 

1-hydroxynaphthalene. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the said compounds of formula (I) are chosen 

from the group consisting of: 

2-hydroxynaphthalene, 
1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, 
1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene, 
2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, and 
2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said compounds of 

formula (I) are preferably chosen from 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene  
 

and 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the concentration of 

compounds of formula (I) in the composition is between 
0.01% and 10% by weight relative to the total weight of 

the composition. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the concentration of 

compounds of formula (I) in the composition is preferably 
between 0.5% and 5% by weight relative to the total 

weight of the composition. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the cosmetic or 

dermatological composition is provided in the form of a 
lotion, a cream, a milk, a gel, a face-pack, microspheres 

or nanospheres or vesicular dispersions. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the cosmetic or 

dermatological composition contains, in addition, a 
humectant, a surfactant, a keratolytic agent, an anti-inflammatory 

agent, a complexing agent, an antioxidant, 
a preservative, a perfume or a sunscreen agent.
