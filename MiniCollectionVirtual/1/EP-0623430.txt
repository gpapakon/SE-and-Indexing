<ABSTRACT>
A vegetable slicer (1) for cutting fruit, vegetables, etc. in slices or strips is composed of a run-on surface (2) designed as a vertically adjustable tongue, of a support roller (3) for the tongue-like run-on surface (2), of a slice cutter (5) which is arranged in a stationary manner above the run-on surface (2) and is aligned approximately parallel to the run-on surface (2), and of vertical strip cutters which can pivot into the run-on surface (2). The support roller (3) is designed as a carrier for at least two rows of strip cutters (31, 32) for which through-passage slits are provided in the run-on surface (2), it being possible for the support roller (3) to be rotated in different angular positions, with the result that the strip cuts can be carried out with different cutter spacings. The support roller (3) has a polygonal, preferably hexagonal, cross-section and is mounted in the frame by a centric shaft.

Vegetable slicer (1), especially for fruit, vegetables and 
similar foodstuffs, for the cutting of the stock, which is to be cut, 

into slices or strips, with a run-up surface (2), which is 
constructed as a tongue adjustable in height, for the stock to be 

cut, as support roller (3) with polygonal cross-section for the 
tongue-like run-up surface (2), a slice cutting knife (5), which is 

arranged in stationary position at a spacing above the tongue-like 
run-up surface (2) in the movement direction (BR) of the stock to be 

cut and which is oriented approximately parallelly to the run-up 
surface (2), with strip cutting blades (31, 32) extending 

perpendicularly with respect to the slice cutting knife (5) and 
pivotable into the run-up surface (2), wherein the support roller (3) 

for the tongue-like run-up surface (2) is formed at the some time as 
a carrier for a least two rows of strip cutting knives (31, 32), the 

knife spacing of which is constant in each row, but different from 

row to row, for which passage slots are present in the tongue-like 
run-up surface (2) and wherein the support roller (3) is rotatable 

into different angular positions so that the strip cuts can be 
performed at different knife spacings, characterised by a V-shaped 

slice cutting blade (5) and a support roller (3), which is centrally 
mounted in the frame by a shaft (34) and at which several spacer dogs 

(34, 34), on which the underside - towards the roller - of the run-up 
surface (2) bears, are present over the circumference of the support 

roller (3), wherein the run-up surface (2) by its first edge (23) 
overhangs the support roller (3) and the front edge (23) is supported 

by the spacer dogs (34, 34). 
Vegetable slicer according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the support roller (3) has a hexagonal cross-section. 
Vegetable slicer according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
thereby that the run-up surface (2) is resiliently mounted at the 

frame (11, 12) in a small pivot range. 
Vegetable slicer according to claim 3, characterised thereby  
 

that the run-up surface (2) is separated from the frame (11, 12) each 
time by a slot (21) and is thus formed to be like a spring tongue.
