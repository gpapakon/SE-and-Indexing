<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a profile part (1) with a claw (9) arranged displaceably in sliding grooves and intended for fastening wall and/or ceiling elements of a facing shuttering. In order largely to prevent bracing and displacement of the wall and/or ceiling elements, the claw (9) exhibits a lug-like extension (14) which, for fixing the claw (9) on the profile part (1), can be bent over at least in the region of a sliding groove (7) with the result that the corresponding region (17) of the extension (14) presses at least against one leg (21) of the sliding groove (7). This means that the wall and/or ceiling elements can be secured, in certain areas, in the given assembly position and subsequent displacement or bracing of said elements is ruled out.

<CLAIMS>
A section piece (1) with a claw (9) displaceably 
arranged in slide grooves (7, 8) for the securing of wall- 

and/or ceiling members of an accessory casing, characterised 
in that the claw (9) has at least one lug-shaped extension 

(14), which can be bent around for the fixing of the claw 
(9) to the section piece (1) in the region of a slide groove 

(7, 8). 
A section piece according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the lug-shaped extension (14) of the claw (9) in its 

region facing away from the slide groove (7, 8) contains a 
slot (15) into which a screw driver or the like can be 

inserted for the bending around of the part (17) of the lug-shaped 
extension (1,4) facing the slide groove (7, 8), and 

that the part (16) of the lug-shaped extension (14) facing 
away from the slide groove (7, 8) is constructed as a 

support of the screw driver or the like. 
A section piece according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the part (
17) of the lug-shaped 
extension (14) facing the slide groove (7, 8) on the side 

(19) lying opposite the slide groove base (18) is undercut 
for the formation of a point (20). 
A section piece according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the slot (15) is guided obliquely 

into the vicinity of the slide groove (7, 8). 
A section piece according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the claw (9) is a stamped sheet metal 

part. 
A section piece according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the section piece (1) is constructed 

in a U-shape and that at its ends (3,4) the slide grooves  
 

(7, 8) are arranged for the claw (9). 
A section piece according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the section piece (1) is made of 

plastics material.
