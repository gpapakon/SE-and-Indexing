<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prober for use in making required 
measurements or aging tests on electric circuit elements or parts such 
as semiconductor integrated circuits, and more particularly, to a 
microprober for such purpose. Recently there have been developed and used systems for making 
required characteristic measurements or aging tests on objects to be 
tested, for example, IC (Integrated Circuit) elements formed on surfaces 
of silicon or other semiconductor substrates, which systems are 
referred to as "main systems" hereinafter. Such main systems require 
probers for precisely and reliably making contact to pads of the 
objects to be tested in order to make electric connections between those 
pads of the objects and the main systems. There has been an ever increasing demand for such probers that are 
capable of making simultaneous probing of a plurality of separate 
objects or of a plurality of objects all produced on a single wafer for 
the following reasons: defective products are detected and rejected by 
the characteristic measurements or aging tests on the products while 
they are still in wafer level and prior to dicing of wafers, thereby 
allowing non-defective products to proceed to subsequent steps. Such 
pre-selection will substantially improve the efficiency with which  
 
integrated circuits are produced, and will be advantageous particularly 
to the selling of integrated circuits in the form of pellets, which is 
commonly called "chip selling". It is, however, very difficult to conduct high-precision and 
reliable probing of a plurality of objects such as wafers 
simultaneously because such objects are liable to be somewhat deformed 
after being subjected to different processings in the course of making 
integrated circuits. Hitherto, elongated metal needles have been used 
to get access to the objects to be tested from the circumference 
thereof. Some probers have a large number of elongated needles 
embedded in their bases with the associated springs. Disadvantageously such probers using elongated needles are large in 
size compared with objects to be tested, and therefore, simultaneous 
probing of numerous objects are impossible. Particularly probers using 
spring-biased needles require high-precision machining, and therefore 
it is almost impossible that such probers are made to be perfect enough 
to permit simultaneous probing of a plurality of objects to be tested. 
Such probers are not suitable for mass production and, if actually 
made, it would be very
