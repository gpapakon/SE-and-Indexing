Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets, comprising a fixed part with two pole 
pieces (1, 2), symmetrical with respect to a vertical mid-plane (7), connected to each other by 

non-magnetic elements (3, 4, 14, 15), and a rotor (5) of cylindrical shape overall, mounted so as 
to rotate about a horizontal axis (6) between the two pole pieces (1, 2) of the fixed part, the rotor 

(5) comprising permanent magnets (25) inserted between two opposite pieces made of soft steel 
(23, 24), and being movable in rotation b
etween an "on" angular position and an "off" angular 
position by means of a manoeuvring device (28), characterised in that the two pole pieces (1, 2) 

of the fixed part move away from each other as they go downwards, the distance between their 
respective bottom ends (9), constituting active poles in the "on" position, being thus great, and 

in that the rotor (5) has an asymmetric structure, its two pieces made from soft steel (23, 24) 
being unequal. 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the two pole pieces (1, 2) of the fixed part are connected to each other, at their top (8) and at their 

base (9), by two horizontal non-magnetic connecting plates (3, 4), with an upper connecting plate 
(3) with a smaller width and a lower connecting plate (4) with a greater width. 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
its fixed part comprises two trapezoidal-shaped non-magnetic closure flanges (14, 15), fixed 

vertically against the two pole pieces (1, 2) and the two connecting plates (3, 4), and carrying the 
bearings (19, 20) of the rotor (5). 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the two opposite pieces made of soft steel (23, 24) of the rotor (5) have 

unequal cross sections, in the form of segments of a circle, one relatively large and the other 
relatively small. 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterised in that the permanent magnets (25) of the rotor (5) are magnets of the "rare earth" 
type. 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
the permanent magnets (25) of the rotor (5) are "neodymium-iron-boron" magnets. 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the manoeuvring device (28) comprises, outside the fixed part, a radial tube 

(31) with a grip (32) which is rotatably connected with the rotor (5) and in which is slidably 
mounted a pusher rod (33) pushed towards the outside by a spring (34), the pusher rod (33) 

carrying a finger or pin (36) which passes through at least one longitudinal aperture (37) in the 
aforementioned tube (31) and which is engaged in a fixed hollowed-out part (38) of circular 

contour (39), having at least one recess (40) for locating the rotor (5) in its "on" angular position. 
Magnetic carrier with permanent magnets according to Claims 3 and 7 together, 
characterised in that the aforementioned hollowed-out part is a hollowed-out region (38) in the 

external face of one of the closure flanges (14) of the fixed part.
