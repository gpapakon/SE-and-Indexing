<ABSTRACT>
An electric immersion heating element has an elongate, metal-sheathed, electrically insulated, resistance heating portion (1) engaged at its ends in bores formed in an element head (2) which may be formed of a synthetic plastics material, a heat transfer element (8) formed of a high thermal conductivity material extends from a heated part of the resistance heating portion adjacent one of its ends through the element head to enable the element temperature to be sensed from the opposite side of the head, and a tubular enclosure (7) extends from the element head (2) and surrounds the said part of the resistance heating portion of the element. The element construction enables dry-boil protection and automatic switch-off on boiling to be achieved by use of a single thermal sensor coupled to the heat transfer element (8) since the steam generated in the enclosure when water boils causes water to be expelled from the enclosure thereby mimicking a dry boil situation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements relating to
electrically powered immersion heating elements and
controls therefor and more particularly concerns
immersion heating elements and controls for water
boiling vessels such as kettles, hot water jugs, pots,
pans, urns and laboratory equipment for example.A conventional immersion heating element for an
electric kettle or hot water jug comprises an
elongate, metal-sheathed, electrically insulated,
resistance heating element coupled to an element head
plate serving for mounting of the element in a wall of
the kettle or hot water jug, the resistance heating
element being curved back towards the element head
plate to define a so-called hot return portion which
is secured to the element head plate, generally at a
level above the general plane of the element.A control for switching off the supply of power
to such a heating element in the event of the 
associated vessel being switched on dry (a so-called
dry boil situation) or being allowed to boil dry
commonly comprises a bimetallic element or other
thermally responsive switch actuator which is held in
close thermal contact with the rear of the element
head in the region thereof where the hot return
portion of the element attaches to the front of the
element head plate. An example of such an element
protection control is the X1 control manufactured by
Otter Controls Limited which is substantially as
described in GB-A-2194099 with reference to Figures
3A, 3B and 3C of the drawings thereof.It is further well known to provide a control for
switching off the heating element when water boils in
the vessel, and this is conventionally accomplished by
provision of a second bimetallic element or other
thermally responsive switch actuator located so as to
be subject to impingement of steam thereon when water
boils in the vessel. An example of such a steam
sensing control is the J1 control manufactured by
Otter Controls Limited which is substantially as
described in GB-A-2248519 with reference to Figures
5A, 5B and 6 of the drawings thereof.A single sensor electronic control for a water
boiling vessel is described in GB-A-2228634. This
control utilizes a thermistor and senses element 
temperature as a function of the electrical resistance
of the thermistor and the onset of boiling as a
function of the rate of change of the thermistor
resistance. However, even with the current state of
modern electronics a circuit capable of switching a
mains load cannot readily be manufactured at a price
competitive with bimetallic

<CLAIMS>
An electric immersion heating element comprising
an elongate, metal-sheathed, electrically insulated,

resistance heating portion (1) intermediate end
portions which are engaged with an element head (2),

a heat transfer element (8) formed of a high thermal
conductivity material extending from a part of the

resistance heating portion (1) adjacent to one of said
end portions and through the element head (2) to

provide for sensing of the element temperature at the
opposite side of the element head from the resistance

heating portion, and an enclosure (7) surrounding the
said part of the resistance heating portion (1), the

arrangement being such that in use of the heating
element with a water boiling vessel the enclosure (7)

will fill with water when the vessel is filled and the
onset of boiling and the consequent generation of

steam in the enclosure (7) will cause the water
substantially to be expelled therefrom so as to mimic

a dry boil situation which can be sensed by an
appropriate thermally-responsive control thermally

coupled to said heat transfer element (8) at said
opposite side of the element head.
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in claim 1 wherein the resistance heating portion (1)

of the element extends between said end portions
without any hot return portion making thermal contact

with the. 
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in claim 1 or 2 wherein the enclosure (7) comprises a

generally tubular member extending from the element
head (2).
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in any of the preceding claims wherein the enclosure

(7) is formed as an integral part of the element head
(2).
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the enclosure (7) is

formed as part of a seal (5) which seals the ends of
the resistance heating portion (1) of the heating

element relative to the element head (2).
An electric immersion heating element as claimed

head (2) is formed of heat-resistant synthetic
plastics material.
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in any of the preceding claims wherein the heat

transfer element (8) comprises a tubular extension of

sheath of the resistance heating portion (1) of the
element.
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in any of the preceding claims wherein the resistance

heating portion (1) of the element has an internal
resistance heating wire which does not extend to the

ends of the element whereby end portions of the
element remain relatively cool in operation, and the

heat transfer element (8) extends from a heated
portion of the element adjacent one of said relatively

cool portions to and through the element head (2).
An electric immersion heating element as claimed
in any of the preceding claims in combination with a

thermally-responsive control having a temperature-sensitive
actuator thermally coupled to said heat
