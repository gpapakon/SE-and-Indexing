<ABSTRACT>
An automatic torque wrenching machine (1) comprises a frame (2) having a support member (3) which can be raised and lowered by admitting air to or allowing air to leave a pneumatic bellows (4). A tong assembly (6) is suspended from the support member (3) by four ties (9) comprising wire ropes (10) each of which is provided with a spring (11). The pneumatic bellows (4) allows pipes to be connected and disconnected with minimal forces on the threads. In addition, the ties enable the tong assembly (6) to float in a generally horizontal plane relative to the frame (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATIC TORQUE WRENCHING MACHINE This invention relates to automatic torque wrench¬ ing machines. Automatic torque wrenching machines are now being used on off-shore drilling platforms to obviate the need for skilled personnel in the highly hazardous area of the rig floor.Typically, such automatic torque wrenching machines are used to make-up and break out joints in pipes which may be up to 500mm in diameter.During a make-up operation it is necessary to bring the threaded end (often referred to as the "pin") of one pipe, for example a length of casing, into contact with a threaded socket on the pipe below. The pipes must then be rotated relative to one another until the joint reaches the desired torque.Because of the substantial weight of the upper pipe it is necessary to support the pipe until the connecting operation is complete to ensure that the weight of the pipe does not damage the threads.To achieve such jointing it has been proposed to grip the lower pipe with a back-up tong, to grip the upper pipe with a power tong and to provide an advancing mechanism which, as the power tong rotates the upper pipe with respect to the lower pipe lowers the power tong towards the back-up tong.Whilst this arrangement works tolerably well it has been found necessary to employ a skilled worker close to the automatic torque wrenching machine to ensure that the thread of the upper pipe initially engages the thread of the socket on the lower pipe correctly. If correct initial engagement does not occur then the advancing mechanism moves the power tong towards the back-up tong prematurely thus damaging the thread. 

 According to the present invention there is provi¬ ded an automatic torque wrenching machine comprising a back-up tong and a power tong movable towards and away from said back-up tong, characterized in that said automatic torque wrenching machine further comprises a pneumatic operator for varying the distance between said power tong and said back-up tong, and means for control¬ ling the pressure of gas in said pneumatic operator.Preferably, said automatic torque wrenching machine comprises a frame having a support member, said power tong is supported from said support member, and said pneumatic operator is operable between said frame and said support member.Advantageously, said back-up tong is suspended from said power tong.A further problem is ensuring that the automatic torque wrenching machine is able to move in a generally horizontal plane with respect to the back-up tong to facilitate connection

<CLAIMS>
Claims :
1. An automatic torque wrenching machine comprising a back-up tong (8;108) and a power tong (7;107) movable towards and away from said back-up tong, characterized in that said automatic torque wrenching machine (1;101) further comprises a pneumatic operator (4;104) for varying the distance between said power tong (7;107) and said back-up tong (8;108), and means for controlling the pressure of gas in said pneumatic operator (4;104). 2. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 1, including a frame (2;102) having a support member (3;103), characterized in that said power tong (7;107) is supported from said support member, and said pneumatic operator (4;104) is operable between said frame (2;102) and said support member (3;103).
3. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said back-up tong (8;108) is suspended from said power tong (7;107).
4. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that said power tong
(7;107) is supported by three or more ties (9;109) which allow said power tong (7;107) to move in a generally horizontal plane.
5. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that said ties (9;109) are attached to separate and distinct locations on said support member (3;103).
6. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that said ties (9;109) are attached to said support member (3;103) substantially directly above their points of attachment to said power tong (7;107).
7. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized in that said ties com- prise wire cables (9;109). 


8. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in Claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, characterized in that said ties also comprise springs (11;111) so that said power tong (7;107) is capable of movement in a horizontal plane. 9. An automatic torque wrenching machine as claimed in any preceding Claim, including a hydraulic operator (104a) arranged to raise and lower said pneumatic opera¬ tor (104).
