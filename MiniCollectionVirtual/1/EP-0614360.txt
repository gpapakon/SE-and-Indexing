<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to substituted β amino acid 
derivatives which inhibit platelet aggregation. Fibrinogen is a glycoprotein present as a 
normal component of blood plasma. It participates in 
platelet aggregation and fibrin formation in the blood 
clotting mechanism. Platelets are cellular elements found in whole 
blood which also participate in blood coagulation. 
Fibrinogen binding to platelets is important to normal 
platelet function in the blood coagulation mechanism. 
When a blood vessel receives an injury, the platelets 
binding to fibrinogen will initiate aggregation and form 
a thrombus. Interaction of fibrinogen with platelets 
occurs through a membrane glycoprotein complex, known as 
gpIIb/IIIa; this is an important feature of the 
platelet function. Inhibitors of this interaction are 
useful in modulating or preventing platelet thrombus 
formation. It is also known that another large 
glycoprotein named fibronectin, which is a major 
extracellular matrix protein, interacts with fibrinogen 
and fibrin, and with other structural molecules such as 
actin, collagen and proteoglycans. Various relatively  
 
large polypeptide fragments in the cell-binding domain 
of fibronectin have been found to have cell-attachment 
activity. (See U.S. Patents 4,517,686; 4,589,881; and 
4,661,111). Certain relatively short peptide fragments 
from the same molecule were found to promote cell 
attachment to a substrate when immobilized on the 
substrate or to inhibit attachment when in a solubilized 
or suspended form. (See U.S. Patents 4,578,079 and 
4,614,517). In U.S. Patent 4,683,291, inhibition of 
platelet function is disclosed with synthetic peptides 
designed to be high affinity antagonists of fibrinogen 
binding to platelets. U.S. Patent 4,857,508 discloses 
tetrapeptides having utility as inhibitors of platelet 
aggregation. Other synthetic peptides and their use as 
inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to platelets are 
disclosed by Koczewiak et al., Biochem. 23, 1767-1774 
(1984); Plow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 82, 8057-8061 
(1985); Ruggeri et al., Ibid. 83, 5708-5712 (1986); 
Ginsberg et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260 (7), 3931-3936 
(1985); Haverstick et al., Blood 66 (4), 946-952 (1985); 
and Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher, Science 238, 491-497 
(1987). Still other such inhibitory peptides are 
disclosed in EP Patent Applications 275,748 and 298,820. U.S. Patent 4,879,313 discloses compounds 
useful as inhibitors of platelet aggregation having the 
formula:
