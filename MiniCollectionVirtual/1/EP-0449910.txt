which can be disassembled and a device for 

their instant connection to each other, in which 

respect wall or frame sections to be connected 
(20, 21; 120, 121) are provided with an aperture 

for anchorage of the instant connection device 
(10; 10′, 110; 210) or with an aperture (23; 

123) with undercuts (24; 124), that the instant 
connection device (10; 10′; 110; 210) comprises 

an adjustable locking element (11; 11′; 110; 
210) with a U-shaped bent leaf spring the U-shank 

ends of which are formed into locking 
protrusions (13; 13′; 113; 213), and a rotary 

element (12; 12′; 112; 212), which extends 
between the U-shanks for the purpose of 

tensioning and which is movable towards the 
locking elements, that the two U-shanks are provided 

with a respective mounting aperture (16; 
116; 216) for a thereinbetween arranged rotary 

element, and that the two U-shanks (11.2, 11.3; 
11.2′, 11.3′; 110.2, 110.3; 210.2, 210.3) of the 

locking element (11; 11′; 110; 210) in an 
unlocked state spring into a locked position, 


characterised in that,
 in a locked state, the 
rotary element (12; 12′; 112; 212) extends 

between the U-shanks of the locking element and 
blocks them in the spring-open position, and 

that the U-shanks can be moved towards each 
other only in a release position of the rotary 

element by pulling out the instant connection  
 

device from the anchorage aperture against a 
spring force of the locking element. 
Instant connection device according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the cross-section of the 
rotary element (12; 12′; 212) is that of an 

equilateral triangle with rounded corners and 
that a socket (18; 218) for a tool to rotate the 

rotary element is provided at least at one end 
surface. 
Instant connection device according to claim 1 
and 2, 
characterised in that
 the leaf spring 
(11) has at each U-shank (11.2, 11.3) a first 

outward curvature (19), which co-acts with one 
of the three corners of the rotary element (12) 

and causes the spring shanks to spread open, and 
a second and third outward curvature (19.1, 

19.2), which co-acts with the other two corners 
of the rotary element and causes pretension in 

the insert plane, and which are arranged so 
that, during rotation of the rotary element (12) 

into a clamping position, initially the first 
outward curvature, and subsequently the other 

two outward curvatures are additionally loaded. 
Instant connection device according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, wherein the rotary element (12) 

comprises a part which extends through the 
mounting apertures (16) of an U-shank (11.2, 

11.3) outward, 
characterised in that
 the socket 
(18) is arranged in the outwardly extending part 

(12.1) as a through-passage, and that the 
mounting aperture (16) of the leaf spring's 

other U-shank (11.3, 11.2) incorporates a pin 
(29) which is inserted into the aperture (18) of 

the rotary element (12).  
 
Instant connection device according to claim 1 
or 2, 
characterised in that
 the rotary element 
(212) comprises an end (212.1) which extends to 

the outside through the mounting apertures (216) 
of one of the U-shanks (210.2) of the leaf 

spring (210), to which the turning tool is 
applied, and that the other end is seated with a 

mounting trough (212.3) on a mounting protrusion 
(217), which is formed on a spring tongue 

(210.4) which is bent out of the other U-shank 
(210.3). 
Instant connection device according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the rotary element (112) 
is arranged as a double-armed pivot level, the 

one arm (112.2) of which forms the protrusion 
which acts on the U-shanks (110.2, 110.3), and 

the other arm (112.3) of which forms an 
engagement location for a locking tool (130). 
Instant connection device according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the U-shaped leaf spring 
is placed at the U-base (110.1) around a 

mounting pin (111), the axis of which extends 
vertically to the rotary axis of the rotary 

element (112), and which extends with the ends 
into recesses (125) of this element (121) for 

the purpose of anchoring the leaf spring in one 
of the parts (121) to be connected. 
Instant connection device according to claim 7, 

characterised in that
 the mounting locations 
(116) of the rotary element, which are formed in 

the U-shanks (110.2, 110.3) of the leaf spring, 
are arranged at a distance from the U-base 

(110.1) of the leaf spring which is greater than 
the length of the mounting pin (111).  

 
Instant connection device according to claim 7 
or 8, 
characterised in that

110.3) of the leaf spring between the U-base 

(110.1) and the mounting locations (116) for the 
rotary element (112) extend in a plane. 
Instant connection device according to one of 
claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the shanks 
(11.2, 11.3; 110.2, 110.3) of the U-shaped bent 

leaf spring terminate in two respective locking 
protrusions (13; 113), which are arranged side 

by side and which, together with an end-inwardly 
arranged counter-protrusion (14), define a 

detent ridge (15; 115). 
Instant connection device according to one of 
claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the ends 
of the U-shanks (11.2, 11.3; 110.2, 110.3) of
