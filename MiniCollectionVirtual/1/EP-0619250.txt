<ABSTRACT>
In a device for conveying layered materials (1) by means of at least one conveyor belt (2), the layered materials (1) to be conveyed being capable of being built up at specific points or in specific regions of the conveying zone, at least one roller conveyor (3) formed by freely rotatable rollers is provided over the entire length of the conveying zone on each of the two sides of the conveyor belt (2) or, if there is a plurality of conveyor belts (2), between and next to the conveyor belts (2). The height of the conveyor belt (2) can be varied in such a way that individual portions of the conveyor belt (2) can be raised above the upper plane (4) of the roller conveyors (3) or lowered below it.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the conveying of layered goods (1) by means of at least one conveyor
belt (2), wherein the layered goods (1) to be conveyed can be accumulated at certain

places or in certain regions of the conveying path, characterised in

1.1 that at least one respective roller track (3) formed by freely rotatable rollers is
provided at both sides of the conveyor belt (2) - or in case several conveyor belts

(2) are present, between and beside the conveyor belts (2) - over the entire length
of the conveying path,
1.2 that the height position of the conveyor belt (2) is variable in such a manner that
individual portions of the conveyor belt (2) can be raised above or lowered below

the upper plane (4) of the roller tracks (3)
1.3 and that presser feet (7), which hold the conveyor belt (2) on the lowered level
below the upper plane (4) of the roller tracks (3), are mounted in front of and

behind those portions of the conveyor belt (2), which are variable in their height
position.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that those portions of the conveyor
belt (2), which are variable in their height position, are smaller than the length of the

largest of the layered goods (1).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the conveyor belt (2) rests
on slide rails (5), wherein the slide rails (5) are variable in their height position.
Device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that at least one respective
pneumatic lifting pad (6) is provided below each of the slide rails (5).
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the lifting pad (6) is provided with
actually known means which enable the raising of the lowered portions of the conveyor

belt (2) at low lifting speed.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the conveyor belt
(2) is constructed as toothed belt. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that each roller
forming the roller track (3) is formed of a plurality of short small rollers arranged one

beside the other.
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the drive control of the raising or
lowering movement of the conveyor belt (2) or the lifting pads (6) takes place by way of a

logic switching system (8), wherein the logic switching system (8) stands in connection
with a large number of inputs for the connection of sensors (9).
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that contactless sensors (9) are used.
Device according to claim 9, characterised in that the sensors (9) are formed as
transmitted light barriers, for which small phototransistors serve as light receivers.
Device according to claim 8, 9 or 10, characterised in that at least two neighbouring
phototransistors each time are connected in parallel.
Device according to one of the claims 8 to 11, characterised in that the spacing of
the sensors (9) one from the other is less than the length of the shortest of the layered

goods (1).
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the length of
the individual layered goods (1) is ascertained by the logic switching system (8) on the

basis of the constant conveying speed and the constant spacing of the sensor (9) and an
alarm is initiated in case of deviation.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the direction of
movement of the conveyor belt (2) is reversible.
