<ABSTRACT>
A device for moving a pivoting/sliding door for passenger vehicles, in particular rail-bound vehicles. The door leaf (1) is connected, via a pivot arm (2), to a carrying member (4) which can be displaced on a guide element (3). The door leaf is supported by two roller levers (9, 10) which engage in guide rails (6) on the door leaf (1). The device exhibits an additional guide rail (8) which is arranged on the door leaf (1) and into which there engages a control roller (11) which is coupled to the door tree tube (5), for example via the roller lever (9). The arrangement of the additional guide rail (8) and the coupling are such that, in a first movement step, the rotary movement of the door tree tube (5) takes place in dependence on the longitudinal movement of the door leaf (1).
