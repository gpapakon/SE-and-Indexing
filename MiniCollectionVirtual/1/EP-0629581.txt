<ABSTRACT>
There is described a process for recovering TiO2 from the residue from TiO2 production, in which ilmenite and/or slag is digested with sulphuric acid and a residue having TiO2 contents of from 20 to 60%, based on the TiO2 solids, remains, wherein   a) the residue is mixed with one or more constituents selected from among iron, iron oxide, iron-containing or iron-oxide-containing residues;   b) the mixture is thermally treated; c) the thermally treated product is mixed with sulphuric acid in a weight ratio TiO2 to H2SO4 of from 1:1 to 1:6; d) the mixture is heated to a temperature of from 130 to 280 DEG C,   e) the mixture is maintained for from 15 mins to 22 hours at a temperature of from 130 to 280 DEG C; f) the digestion cake obtained therefrom is worked up and fed to hydrolysis.

A method for recovering TiO
2
 from the residue from 
TiO
2
 production, in which ilmenite and/or slag is 
decomposed with sulphuric acid and a residue with TiO
2
 
contents of 20 to 60%, relative to the TiO
2
 solids 
content, remains, characterised in that 


a) the residue is mixed with one or more 
constituents, selected from iron, iron oxide, 

iron-containing or iron oxide-containing residues; 
b) the mixture is heat-treated; 
c) the heat-treated product is mixed with sulphuric 
acid in a weight ratio of TiO
2
 to H
2
SO
4
 of 1 : 1 to 
1 : 6; 
d) the mixture is heated to a temperature of 130° to 
280°C; 
e) the mixture is kept for 15 minutes to 22 hours at 
a temperature of 130° to 280°C; 
f) the decomposition cake obtained therefrom is 
worked up and is sent for hydrolysis. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the residue is mixed with one or more 

constituents, selected from iron, iron oxide, iron-containing 
or iron oxide-containing residues, and at 

least one constituent, selected from carbon and carbon-containing 
residues in accordance with method step (a).  

 
A method according to Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the mixture is sintered in a modification of 

method step (b) and the sinter product is then ground. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that in method step (c) the product is mixed with 

sulphuric acid in a weight ratio of TiO
2
 to H
2
SO
4
 of 
1 : 1 to 1 : 5. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that in method step (c) the product is mixed with 

sulphuric acid in a weight ratio of TiO
2
 to H
2
SO
4
 of 
1 : 0.5 to 1 : 2.5 and then oleum is added to the 

mixture in a weight ratio of TiO
2
 to H
2
SO
4
 of 1 : 0.5 to 
1 : 3.5. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that in method step (d) the mixture is heated to a 

temperature of 130° to 280°C and in method step (e) the 
mixture is kept for 15 minutes to 6 hours at a 

temperature of 130° to 280°C. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that in method step (d) the mixture is heated to a 

temperature of 130° to 230°C and in method step (e) the 
mixture is kept for 15 minutes to 6 hours at a 

temperature of 130° to 230°C. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the mixture, for heat treatment 

in accordance with method step (b), is introduced into 
a rotary kiln, a stationary or circulating fluidised 

bed or a sintering apparatus.
