<ABSTRACT>
An automatic assembly 
for delivering infusions of coffee comprises a stator 

body (1), in the inside of which there is rotatably supported 
a rotor (2), including a chamber (5) housing an infusion 

piston therein. 
The rotor can be successively located at a 
loading station (40) for introducing the coffee powder, 

an infusion station (50) and at an unloading station where the dry 
coffee grounds are ejected. 
Pressing means (11,17,19,21,23) there are provided 
operating on the piston (10) for pressing the coffee 

powder before making the infusion, and for drying-pressing 
the coffee pad (7) after having made the 

infusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relat es to an automatic 
assembly for delivering infusions of coffee and the 
like, with an automatic ejecting of the dry coffee 
grounds. There are already available automatic assemblies 
for delivering infusions of coffee which 
substantially comprise a body which can be displaced, 
successively, between a loading station in 
which the coffee powder is automatically introduced, 
and an infusion station, in which there is prepared 
the coffee infusions by suitably metering hot water. These prior assemblies are also adapted to 
perform a further operating step, in which the 
coffee pad is brought to an unloading station for 
the ejection therefrom. The mentioned prior coffee making assemblies, 
in addition to being very complex from a mere construction 
standpoint, have the further drawback of 
ejecting the pressed coffee pad in a wet condition. The document EP-A-0 217 198 discloses all automatic assembly for 
delivering infusions of coffee and the like having substantially the 
features of the introductory portion of claim 1, said assembly having 
means for drying the coffee pad after the coffee infusion, so that 
the coffee pad can be ejected free of moisture.  
 Accordingly, the main object of the present 
invention is to solve the above mentioned problem, 
by providing an automatic assembly for delivering  
 
infusions of coffee and the like, with means for 
ejecting dry coffee grounds, which allows to perform, 
after the delivery of the coffee infusion, 
a drying step on the pressed coffee pad. More specifically, the above mentioned automatic 
assembly which is specifically adapted to perform 
a programmed set of operating steps, by exploiting 
a hydraulic pressure for all of the driving 
movements of the infusing piston, is very reliable 
and safe in operation and, morevoer, is very competitive 
from a mere economic standpoint. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become more 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by an automatic 
assembly for delivering infusions of coffee and 
the like, having the features of the characterizing portion of Claim 1.  
 Further characteristics and advantages of 
the invention will become more apparent hereinafter 
from the following detailed description of a preferred, 
though not exclusive, embodiment of an automatic 
assembly for delivering infusions of coffee 
and the like, with the ejection of dry coffee grounds, 
and being illustrated, by way of an

<CLAIMS>
An automatic assembly for delivering 
infusions of coffee and the like, with means for 

ejecting the dry coffee grounds, comprising a stator 
body (1) in the inside of which there is rotatably 

supported a rotor (2), including a chamber (5) housing 
therein an infusion piston (10), said rotor (2) being 

adapted to be arranged, successively, at a loading 
station for introducing coffee powder, an infusion 

station and an unloading station, pressing means (11) 
being moreover provided, operating on said piston (10), 

for dry-pressing the coffee powder pad upon having made 
the infusion, characterized in that said pressing means 

comprises means to introduce water into said chamber (5) at the rear 
portion of said piston (10) and an outer piston telescopic element (11) 

provided with sealing gaskets (12), for providing 
tightness with respect to the chamber (5), and 

including at the bottom an abutment (16) engaging with 
an outer spring operating, at the other end thereof, on 

an inner flange portion (18) thereon operates an inner 
spring (21) engaging, at the other end portion thereof, 

with a rim portion (22) of a fixed lug (23) connected 
to the bottom of said chamber (5). 
An automatic assembly, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said rotor (2) is provided 

with rotary pins (3) connected to a motor reducing unit 
(4).  

 
An automatic assembly, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said assembly further 

comprises, at the top portion of said outer telescopic 
element (11), channels (30) for delivering infusion 

water, said channels (30) being adapted to be 
communicated with ducts (31) to deliver said infusion 

water. 
An automatic assembly, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the bottom of said chamber 

(5), at the rear portion of the outer telescopic 
element (11), communicates with a duct (13) for 

introducing water for driving the piston (10). 
An automatic assembly, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said assembly further 

comprises, at said motor reducing unit (4), 
microswitches (41, 42) adapted to control the movement 

of said chamber (5) to the several operating stations. 
An automatic assembly, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said assembly further 

comprises a solenoid valve (51) for delivering the 
piston driving water, and adapted to take up the water 

from a boiler (52) and to introduce said water into 
said chamber (5) at the rear portion of said piston 

(10). 
An automatic assembly, according to Claim  
 

1, characterized in that said assembly further
