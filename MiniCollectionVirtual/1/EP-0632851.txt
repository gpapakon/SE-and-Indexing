<ABSTRACT>
A chemical formulation and method are provided for the treatment of water to prevent, control or inhibit corrosion and/or deposits, particularly for the treatment of water in water distribution piping and equipment and associated heat exchangers and more particularly for the treatment of water in heat transfer equipment wherein water or steam is employed as the heat transfer medium. The method treats the water with at least one mono- or polyhydric alcohol. Optionally, the treatment formulation is a blend of mono- or polyhydric alcohols and further optionally includes one or more of a mixed molecular weight poly(acrylic acid) and/or at least one salt thereof; at least one chromium-free lignosulfonate, and at least one carboxylic acid and/or at least one salt thereof, the carboxylic acid being different from the poly(acrylic acid).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a (1) chemical formulation useful
for treating water to inhibit corrosion and/or deposit
formation, particularly useful to inhibit, prevent or control
corrosion and/or deposit formation in water distribution piping
and equipment and associated heat exchangers and also
particularly useful for the prevention, control or inhibition of
corrosion and of deposits in heat transfer equipment wherein
water or steam is employed as a heat transfer medium and (2)
process for using such chemical formulation. In a specific
embodiment, the invention relates to the application of the
formulation and process in cases where geothermal hot water and
steam are used as the heat transfer medium. A number of examples can be cited of industrial and other
applications in which ground water (i.e., well water) is
employed as a heat transfer medium. For example, in some areas
of the world, geothermal hot water and steam are available at
underground depths such that they can be economically captured.
In such areas, present day prices and pollution concerns
associated with the use of fossil fuels make it practical to use
geothermal heat to drive equipment such as electrical generation
equipment.Geothermal heat is increasingly being used for this purpose.
Geothermal heat can also be used to provide hot utility water
for other applications such as heating buildings or for driving
chemical processes.A typical "geothermic circuit" consists of a production well
drilled into a suitable porous rock formation or aquifer to a
depth sufficient to provide the required volume of water. The 
depth can vary considerably, depending on the geological
configuration of the surrounding strata. The well is usually
provided with a submersible production pump, although in some
cases, the water or steam pressure within the well is sufficient
to force the water to the surface. At the surface, the
geothermal hot water and/or steam is passed through one or a
series of heat exchangers to produce hot utility water or steam
for, by way of example, turbine powered electricity generation.
After passing through the heat exchanger(s), the water is
returned to the ground via a waste well drilled to a
predetermined appropriate depth, thus completing the circuit.Well water is also increasingly being employed as a heat
transfer medium for air conditioning/heat pump systems. The
same basic geothermal circuit is employed as that described in
the preceding paragraph except that hot water is not employed.A serious problem involved with the use of
