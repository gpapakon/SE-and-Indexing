<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous compositions 
containing an iodophenoxy alkylene ether as the contrast 
agent and methods for their use in diagnostic radiology of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Roentgenographic examination utilizing X-rays and 
computed tomography (hereinafter CT) scans of fractures and 
other conditions associated with the skeletal system is 
routinely practised without the use of contrast agents. X-ray 
visualization of organs containing soft tissue, such as the 
gastrointestinal (hereinafter GI) tract, requires the use of 
contrast agents which attenuate X-ray radiation. 
D. P.Swanson, et al in "Pharmaceuticals In Medical Imaging", 
1990, MacMillan Publishing Company, provides an excellent 
background in medical imaging utilizing contrast agents and 
compositions therewith. Roentgenographic examination of the GI tract is indicated 
for conditions of digestive disorders, changes in bowel habit, 
abdominal pain, GI bleeding and the like. Prior to radiological 
examination, administration of a radiopaque contrast medium 
is necessary to permit adequate delineation of the respective 
lumen or mucosal surface from surrounding soft tissues. 
Accordingly, a contrast medium is administered orally to 
visualize the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum 
and proximal small intestine. The contrast medium is 
administered rectally for examination of the distal small 
intestine and the colon. The most widely used contrast agent for the visualization 
of the GI tract is barium sulfate administered as a suspension 
orally or rectally as an enema. (See, for example, U.S. Patent 
Nos.: 2,659,690; 2,680,089; 3,216,900; 3,235,462; 4,038,379 
and 4,120,946) Notwithstanding its relatively good contrast  
 
characteristics, negligible absorption from the GI tract 
following oral or rectal administration and speedy excretion 
from the body, barium sulfate has certain disadvantages. In 
the presence of intestinal fluids it lacks homogeneity and 
poorly adheres to mucus membranes which can result in poor 
X-ray images. In the colon, when administered as an enema, it 
flocculates and forms irregular clumps with fecal matter. Iodinated organic compounds have also been used as 
GI contrast agents since the iodine atom is an effective X-ray 
absorber. They have the most versatility and are utilized in 
the widest variety of procedures. They are very absorptive of 
X-rays with which the iodine interacts and produce a so-called 
photoelectric effect which is a large magnification in contrast 
caused by the
