<ABSTRACT>
In a video reproducing apparatus for reproducing 
compressed video information at a predetermined period 

irrespective of a reproducing processing ability, a 
frame skip is reduced. A moving image is alternately 

intraframe coded and interframe coded every frame. As 
a header of coding information, ID information 

indicative of a compression coding method is included. 

Upon reproduction, when the apparatus is not in time 
for reproduction display, a decoding process 

up to the process just before the intraframe coded 
frame which is located at the latter position with 

respect to the time is skipped with reference to the 
header.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus and, more particularly, to an
image processing apparatus which handles coding data.In a system for synchronously reproducing a video
image and an audio signal as an example of such an
image processing apparatus, there are a system such as
TV conference system, television telephone system, or
the like which requires a real-time performance and a
system in which a real-time performance is relatively
weak and which handles video/audio information file
(hereinafter, simply abbreviated as a video file)
preserved or stored in a recording medium of a large
capacity. According to the former system, since the
coding on the transmission side of the video and audio
signals and the decoding on the reception side must be
performed in a real-time manner, so that an exclusive-use
hardware is needed. The latter system relates to,
for example, the case of constructing a video data base
comprising a number of video files. An importance is
paid to a picture quality, a transmitting time (or
transmission costs), or the like rather than the real-time
performance of the video image. There are the following limitations in the
video/audio transmitting system which is constructed by
using a general work station. That is, in general, a
frame memory of the display system is constructed by
eight bits and uses 256 colors among 6.40 million
colors. The color to be displayed can be selected by a
lookup table method. On the other hand, in the case
where a black and white image and a color image mixedly
exist and are displayed by a color monitor of eight
bits, the black and white image can be expressed by 128
gradations (gray scale) and a color image can be
expressed by 64 colors by allocating two bits to each
of the colors of R, G, and B by a dither processing.In the communicating and accumulating systems,
both of the audio data and the video data are
compressed and coded, thereby reducing a data amount.
As a compressing method, there are three types of
methods: an interframe coding (INTER) method; an
intraframe coding (INTRA) method; and a method using
both of the INTER method and the INTRA method.
According to the compressing method using both of the
interframe coding method and the intraframe coding
method, generally, in order to prevent the propagation
of a transmission error and to make a special
reproduction easy, the intraframe coded frames are
arranged adaptively or uniformly at proper intervals.
As an individual coding method, a discrete cosine 
transformation
