<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of preparing 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol 
represented by the following 

formula (1). The method includes the steps of: (a) 
reacting 2-chloro-monochloromethylpyridine with an alkali 

metal salt of a carboxylic acid and/or a hydrate of the 
alkali metal salt so as to form an ester derivative; and 

(b) hydrolyzing the ester derivative so as to form the 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
preparing 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol which is represented 
by the following formula (1) and is useful as a raw 
material of medicines and and agricultural chemicals. 
 
For example, 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol represented by the 
formula (1) is known as an intermediate for preparing an 
anti-peptic ulcer (see JP-A-58-170779 and JP-A-1-230556) 
and as an intermediate for preparing an insecticide (see 
JP-A-61-12682). Hitherto, there have been some proposed methods of 
preparing 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol represented by the 
formula (1). Of these, for example, there is provided a 
method in which 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol is produced by 
reducing 2-chloro-(iso)nicotinic acid or its ester with 
sodium boron hydride (see JP-A-1-230556 and U.S. Patent 
No. 4,576,629). However, this method has a problem that 
diborane and hydrogen which have the risk of explosion are 
produced. There is provided another method in which 2-chloro-4-pyridinemethanol 
is produced by hydrogenating 2-chloro-4-cyanopyridine 
in the presence of a catalyst for 
hydrogenolysis (see JP-A-4-243867). However, this method 
has problems that a large amount of 2-chloro-4-amino-methylpyridine 
as a by-product is produced and that 
chlorine of the pyridine nucleus is released in the 
reaction. There is provided still another method in which 
2-chloro-4-methylpyridine-N-oxide is reacted with acetic 
anhydride so as to form 2-chloro-4-acetoxymethylpyridine 
and then this acetoxymethylpyridine is hydrolyzed so as to 
form 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol (see Yakugaku Zasshi 
(written in Japanese) Vol. 81, pp. 574-578, 1961). 
However, this method has a problem that a large amount of  
 
by-product in the form of tar is produced by the reaction 
between 2-chloro-4-methyl-pyridine-N-oxide and acetic 
anhydride. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved method of preparing 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol, 
which is free of the above-mentioned drawbacks. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a method of preparing 2-chloro-pyridinemethanol 
represented by the following formula (1), 
 
the method comprising the steps of: 
(a) reacting 2-chloro-monochloromethylpyridine 
represented by the following formula (2) with an alkali 
metal salt of a carboxylic acid represented by the 
following formula (3) and/or a hydrate of said alkali 
metal salt so as to form an ester derivative represented 
by the following formula (4); and (b) hydrolyzing said ester derivative so as to form
