<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a method with which the expansion 
of CATV services and the diversity of subscribers' needs 

can be dealt with flexibly, it is easier to maintain and 
expand the apparatus, the system can be operated simply, 

and the parental control function is also simple. A 
head end (100) and a subscriber terminal unit (HIB) (500) 

have two-way communication means and are connected to 
each other via a two-way transmission line (701). The 

HIB (500) and subscriber remote control units (601 to 
603) each have two-way communication means. The output 

of HIB (500) is supplied to various types of apparatuses 
(e.g., TVs or VTRs). The HIB (500) can also exchange 

data with an expansion unit (604). To control various 
types of apparatuses with a remote control unit, the 

remote control unit communicates with the HIB (500), 
receives the necessary data under the control of HIB 

(500), and together with HIB (500), controls various 
types of apparatuses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a two-way CATV system where a lot
of terminal units are connected to what is called a center
via cables and the center transmits image signals to the
terminal units. It also relates to a remote control system.The document "Selektor, April 4, 1990, Aachen, DE, pages 10 -
12, D2B-Home Bus for Audio and Video" describes a D2B bus
standard, which connects modern Audio and Video devices of
different manufactures with a standardized interface into an
intelligent self-controlling system. An example of the
intelligent system including a satellite receiver, a
television monitor, a DV tuner, video recorder, an audio
system and a telephone is described.US-A-4,885,803 describes a system and method for controlling a
distributing entertainment signals from a plurality of
electronic entertainment devices to a plurality of remote
locations within a building. Within each remote location an
infrared detector is provided for receiving control signals
from a remote control transmitter for controlling the
corresponding entertainment device.US-A-5,151,789 describes a system for interfacing a cable
television decoder to a VCR incorporating a television
scheduling system. The VCR receives commands from its own
remote controller. A remote control emulator is provided for
replacing the conventional cable decoder remote controller
such that the user can communicate with the system using the 
VCR remote controller. The remote control emulator drives an
infrared emitter which is positioned in front of an infrared
input on the cable decoder thus allowing the transmission of
control signals from the remote controller via the emulator
to the cable decoder.US-A-4,972,503 discloses a method and apparatus for determining
the channel of a plurality of predetermined channels to which
a remotely controlled received is turned. A remote
transmitter transmits infrared, ultrasonic, radio frequency
or other radiated control signals for each of the viewer
selections. A receiver device in a channel detection systems
receives a signal in the selected transmission medium and
immediately signals a jamming device to broadcast
interference which precludes the remotely controlled received
from identifying and acting upon the transmitted control
signals. The receiver device applies the received signal to a
processor device that performs a stored program to determine
if the received signal corresponds to a transmitted control
signal from the viewer transmitter device and, if so, to
identify the channel to which the monitored
