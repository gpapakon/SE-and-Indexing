<ABSTRACT>
An automated transmission (10) system having a selectable automatic shift 
initiation mode of operation (D) is provided with manually operated selectors 

(226/228) for selectively increasing and decreasing the engine speeds (240, 242) 
at which upshifts and downshifts are implemented in the automatic shift initiation 

mode of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fully or partially automated vehicular 
transmission systems having at least one mode of operation wherein shifts from 
a currently engaged gear ratio into an automatically selected target gear ratio are 
automatically initiated at a selected engine speed for a given set of vehicle 
operating parameters. In particular, the present invention relates to fully or 
partially automated transmission systems of the above-described type wherein the 
vehicle driver can manually modify, within limits, the engine speeds, often referred 
to as shift points or shift profiles, at which shifts will be automatically initiated in 
the automatic shift initiation mode. Fully and partially automated vehicular transmission systems having at least 
one automatic shift initiation mode wherein shifts from a currently engaged gear 
ratio into a selected target gear ratio are automatically initiated at a selected engine 
speed for a given set of vehicle operating conditions are well known in the prior 
art. Examples of such transmission may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,361,060; 4,430,911; 4,648,290; 4,722,248; 5,053,961; 5,053,962 and 
5,109,721. In such prior art automated transmission systems, it is known to define a 
standard or default set of conditions, including engine speed, or a related 
parameter usually called shift points and/or shift profiles, at which, in the 
automatic shift implementation mode, and in the absence of preset conditions, a 
shift will be automatically implemented. It is also known to sense for the presence 
of such preset conditions, e.g. stable operating conditions, and to automatically modify the shift points/shift profiles 
by increasing or decreasing the engine speeds at shifts are automatically 
implemented in response to sensing the presence of such conditions as may be seen by reference to EP-B2-0109759, 
from which are known the features of the preamble of claim 1, 
in response to overtravel depression of the throttle pedal (i.e. "kick 
down"), upshifts may be delayed by increasing the engine speeds at which  
 
upshifts are initiated. For another example, to prevent "hunting", for a period of 
time after a downshift, the engine speeds at which upshifts are initiated may be 
increased and/or for a period of time after an upshift, the engine speeds at which 
downshifts are initiated may be decreased. Examples of such automatic shift point/shift profile modification may be 
seen by reference to above-mentioned U.S. Patent No. 4,361,060, and to

An automated vehicular transmission system comprising a fuel throttle 
controlled engine (E), a multiple speed change gear mechanical transmission (10) 

having an input shaft (16) and an output shaft (90), a friction clutch drivingly 
interposed between the engine and the transmission input shaft, a.first sensor 

(11/98/100) for providing a first input signal indicative of engine rotation speed 
(ES/IS/OS*GR), a mode selector (210) for manual selection of transmission 

operating modes, including a manual shift initiation mode (H) and an automatic 
shift initiation mode (D), and for providing a second input signal indicative of the 

selected transmission mode, an upshift/downshift selector (226/228) for selecting 
manual initiation of upshifts and downshifts, respectively, in the manual shift 

initiation mode and for providing third and fourth input signals, respectively 
indicative of the direction of manually selected shift, a central processing unit
