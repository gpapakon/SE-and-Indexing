<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high voltage generator comprising 
a first series of voltage multiplying stages, each stage comprising 
a diode and a capacitor one terminal of which being connected to 
the cathode of the respective diode, wherein every cathode of a 
diode is connected to the anode of the diode of the next voltage 
multiplying stage, a clock generator which is able to generate 
clock pulses being 180° out of phase with one another and being 
supplied alternately to the other terminal of the capacitors of 
successive voltage multiplying stages, the last diode in the series 
having a high voltage output and said high voltage output being 
connected to feed-back means, which modifies said two clock pulses 
in dependence on the voltage on the high voltage output. Such a high voltage generator is known from the European 
patent application 0,350,462. Said known high voltage generator 
generates a high voltage pulse for instance to program (E)EPROM-memory 
cells. Therefore, a voltage of about 5 V is converted in a 
pulse of about 16 V, which value is sufficient to program (E)EPROM-memory 
cells. Every voltage multiplying stage functions as a charge 
pump and after each stage a voltage increase at most equal to the 
step value of the clock pulse less the threshold voltage of the 
diodes occurs. A disadvantage of said known arrangement is that the high 
voltage output shows spikes whenever one of both clock pulses 
switches. Japanese patent application JP-A-56.094962 discloses a transformerless 
type DC/DC converter which is controlled by two reverse-phased 
clock pulses ₁ and ₂. The output voltage of the output 
terminal is entirely determined by PWM-control of the two reverse-phased 
clock pulses. US Patent US-A-5,036,229 discloses an arrangement comprising 
multiple multiplier stages in a charge pump, which multiplier 
stages are controlled by clock pulses. The application of several  
 
charge pumps in parallel are described. The object of the invention is to provide an arrangement neutralizing 
the disadvantage related to the prior art and the output 
voltage of which does not show any spikes any more. The arrangement according to the invention is therefore characterized 
in that at least the last capacitor of the multiplying 
stages is connected to a junction in order to be supplied with a 
control voltage during operation, said junction being connected to 
an input of a control circuit having two outputs, said junction 
also being connected to current charging means, which is controlled 
by
