<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic tape cassette whose reliability is considerably 
improved by preventing triboelectrification by tape-and-guide 

friction. A metal tape guide for guiding the magnetic tape 
while in contact with the back surface of the tape. The 

substrate of the magnetic tape is made of polyethylene 
terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate, and has a surface 

specific resistance R₈ of 10⁸ Ω/cm² or more. The tape guide is 
made of stainless steel or aluminum, and the surface roughness 

of the tape guide is such that the root mean square roughness 

value R
rms
, as determined by height from a reference surface, is 
60 nm or lower. Also, the back surface of the tape may be 

provided with 30 to 400 protrusions of a height of 300 nm per 
0.1 mm².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic tape cassette,
and more particularly to a magnetic tape cassette, used for a
VTR, for example, with metal tape guides for guiding a magnetic
tape while in contact with the magnetic surface of the magnetic
tape.Magnetic recording media have widely been used for
recording tape cassettes, video tape cassettes, computer tape
cassettes, disc cartridges, and the like. The recording
density of a magnetic recording medium such as a magnetic tape
has been increased year by year. With this increase in
recording density, the wavelength of the recorded signal is
proportionately reduced. Also, digital recording methods are
starting to supplant the analog recording methods currently
widely employed. In order to increase the recording density,
a thin metallic film is sometimes used for the magnetic layer.There have been many proposals to improve the
electromagnetic characteristics of a coated magnetic tape in
which one side of a substrate (nonmagnetic support) is coated
with magnetic material. Some of these proposals relating to
improving the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic powder
used it he magnetic material, while others relate to techniques
for smoothing the surface of the magnetic layer. However, 
those proposals are still insufficient in satisfying the
required high density of recording.As the wavelength of the recorded signal is shortened due
to the increased recording density, self-demagnetization
sometimes occurs in the recording mode whereby the output level
is reduced as the magnetic layer becomes thicker. For this
reason, efforts have been made to reduce the thickness of the
magnetic layer. However, when the magnetic layer is thinned,
the surface of the magnetic layer can be more easily influenced
by the surface roughness of the substrate. This results in
deterioration of the electromagnetic characteristics of the
tape.To avoid this, production of magnetic tape with an
extremely smooth surface is desired. A general means to
realize this is to smooth the surface of the substrate. The
smoothed substrate surface improves the electromagnetic
characteristics of the magnetic layer formed on the substrate,
but causes poor running of the magnetic tape constructed using
such a substrate. To solve this problem, a back layer can be
provided on the surface of the substrate opposite the surface
thereof having the magnetic layer. For the details of a
technique using a back layer, reference is made to Examined
Japanese Patent Application No. Sho. 50-3927, and Published
