<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the growth of
epitaxial silicon carbide films at low temperatures using
silicon containing cyclobutanes as the source gas in a
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.Crystalline silicon carbide is useful in many high
temperature, high power and high frequency semiconductor
device applications because of properties such as a wide
bandgap, high saturated electron drift velocity, high
breakdown electric field, high thermal conductivity and good
chemical resistance. However, most all fabrication
processes require the formation of single crystal silicon
carbide films. Normally, these films are grown by CVD at
temperatures above 1000°C. For instance, Learn et al.,
Appl. Phys. Let., Vol. 17, No. 1, July 1970, show the
formation of cubic silicon carbide on alpha (6H) and beta
(3C) silicon carbide substrates by the reactive evaporation
or reactive sputtering of silicon in acetylene at
temperatures as low as 1100°C. Similarly, Steckl and Li,
IEEE Transactions on Electronic Devices, Vol. 39, No. 1,
Jan. 1992, teach the formation of beta (3C) silicon carbide
films on carbonized silicon (100) by rapid thermal CVD of
silane and propane at 1100-1300°C.Other investigators have also demonstrated the
deposition of 3C silicon carbide films from organosilicon
precursors at elevated temperatures. For instance,
Takahashi et al., J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol 139, No. 12,
Dec. 1992, teach the formation of 3C silicon carbide on 
Si(100) and Si(111) substrates (with and without a
carbonized layer) by atmospheric pressure CVD using
hexamethyldisilane and hydrogen gas mixtures at temperatures
of 1100°C.Golecki et al., Appl. Phys. Lett, 60 (14), April
1992, teach the formation of cubic silicon carbide on
silicon (100) substrates by low pressure CVD using
methylsilane at substrate temperatures as low as 750°C. The
process described therein, however, is limited just to the
use of methylsilane as the precursor gas.The use of silicon containing cyclobutanes to form
amorphous or polycrystalline silicon carbide films is also
known in the art. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 5,011,706,
teaches the formation of amorphous silicon carbide coatings
by low temperature plasma enhanced CVD using a silicon
containing cyclobutane. Similarly, Larkin et al., Mat. Res.
Soc. Symp. Proc. 204, 141 (1991) describe the formation of
polycrystalline silicon carbide films on silicon (100)
substrates by low temperature CVD using substituted 1,3-disilacylobutanes.
Likewise, Johnson et al., Mat. Res. Soc.
Symp. Proc. (November 1992)
