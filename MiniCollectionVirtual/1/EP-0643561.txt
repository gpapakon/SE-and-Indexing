<DESCRIPTION>
Termites, insects of the order Isoptera, live 
almost exclusively on cellulose in vegetable matter. 
However, they can cause considerable damage to other 
materials in their guest for cellulose, including 
structural damage to buildings, destruction of foods 
such as growing crops, grassland, forestry (especially 
young saplings), household goods, stored food, 
cellulose based materials such as wood, paper, cotton, 
fiber matter, and the like. The tendency to attack 
each of the above materials will vary from species to 
species. Damage to structures or other materials may be 
prevented or diminished by the use of insecticidal 
compounds active against termites. Such compounds are 
conventionally applied either to the termite infested 
material itself or to its component members, e.g., by 
treatment of timber components before incorporation of 
the timber into the building, or to soil area 
surrounding the building. The majority of commercially available 
insecticides do not have the combination of biological 
and physicochemical properties necessary for effective 
termite control (e.g., activity against termites  
 
combined with long-term persistence, although the 
chlorinated hydrocarbon aldrin has proved effective. However, increased regulatory controls on 
chlorinated hydrocarbons have created a need for a 
termiticide which combines the necessary activity and 
persistence with a low mammalian toxicity. Certain acyl urea compounds are claimed to be 
effective against termites. For instance, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,833,158 claims flufenoxuron as a termiticide; 
and diflubenzuron has also been disclosed specifically 
as a termiticide. Hexaflumuron (N-(((3,5-dichloro-4-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy)phenyl)amino)carbonyl)-2,6-difluoro 
benzamide), a compound with a low mammalian toxicity, 
has been described as possessing insecticidal activity 
against insects from the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, 
Diptera, Orthoptera, Homoptera, Thysanoptera, and 
Acarina (U.S. Patent No. 4,468,405). It has now been 
found that hexaflumuron and other structurally related 
compounds are surprisingly more effective as a 
termiticide than structurally unrelated acyl urea 
compounds such as, for instance, diflubenzuron. The present invention is directed to the use of a 
compound of the formula 
  
 
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen, 
C1-C3 alkyl or C1-C3 alkoxy, chloro, bromo or fluoro; 
X1 and X2 are each independently chloro, fluoro, 
bromo, hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl; and R is a fluorine 
containing C1-C4
