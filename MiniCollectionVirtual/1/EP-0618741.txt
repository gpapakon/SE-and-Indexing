<ABSTRACT>
The innovation relates to a distribution arrangement, especially for the main distribution frame of telephone and data lines, comprising a distribution rack, a distribution frame, pivotable frames, to terminate the system side and the subscriber side. To achieve the object of the innovation, i.e. to develop a distribution arrangement of the generic type in which the jumpering facilities and the adaptation to computerised switching system facilities are improved and in which the organisation of a main distribution frame is thereby optimised, the subscriber side and the system side are disposed adjacent to one another on a profile frame in modular form and are set up vertically on top of one another in relation to rack rows located next to one another.

<CLAIMS>
Distributor arrangement, in particular for the
main distribution frame of telephone and data lines,

comprising a distributor rack, distributor frame, pivoting
frame, for termination on the system side and on the

subscriber side, characterized in that the subscriber
side (1) and the system side (2) are arranged adjacent to

one another in a modular manner on a profile frame (7)
and are constructed vertically one above the other to

form side-by-side rack rows (12).
Distributor arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the profile frames (7) for accommodating

(side-by-side) the modules (3) for the subscriber
side (1) and the modules (4) for the system side (2)

comprise two perforated plates (24), which are connected
to one another via mutually parallel round-profile rods

(31), and are mounted on supports (11, 13) of the distributor

rack.
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the width of the profile frame

(7) is governed essentially by the distance between the
round-profile rods (31) and is defined by the length of

the connecting strips used, which are based on
insulation-piercing terminal technology and are latched

onto the round-profile rods (31).
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the profile frames (7) are

mounted such that they can pivot forwards.
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
4, characterized in that an upper hinge (40) and a lower 

hinge (41) are mounted on the supports (11, 13), engage
by means of bolt bars (28) with bolts (25) on the upper

and the lower perforated plates (24) and in which the
profile frame (7) is suspended such that it can pivot.
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the profile frame (7) is provided

with a locking apparatus (28, 30).
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that a clamping lever (30) is connected

to the bolt bar (28).
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
7, characterized in that the profile frames (7) located

one above the other are connected by means of a coupling.
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
8, characterized in that the supports (11) are formed by

Z-section plates (13).
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
9, characterized in that the cable holders (32 to 36) are

provided from brackets (33) and/or from U-shaped holders
(35) and from resilient clips (36).
Distributor arrangement according to Claims 1 to
10, characterized in that means (10, 11) are provided for

installation in the open air, or, alternatively, means
are provided for mounting on a wall.
