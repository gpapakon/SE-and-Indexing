<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a connection terminal for a firing device, in particular for discharge-lamp starters. The terminal comprises a housing (5) in which is mounted a terminal insert (1) with a sleeve (6) which can be introduced into the insert. The terminal is designed so that it will meet the requirements for the leakage gap necessary for the maximum voltage which will occur. The terminal is thus particularly suitable for use in starters designed to make it possible to restart a discharge lamp immediately after the discharge has cut out.

Terminal, particularly for connecting connector leads between a lamp 
socket and an igniter device for high voltage gas discharge lamps, having a terminal 

housing (5) and a terminal insert (1) positioned inside the terminal housing and having 
apparatus which prevents the terminal insert (1) from falling out of the terminal 

housing (5),
 
   characterized in that
 
   the terminal insert (1) is held in position by an insertion sleeve (6) which 

is slidable into the preferably sleeve-shaped terminal housing 
and the terminal housing (5) extends beyond the terminal insert (1) by a 

distance (L) which corresponds at least approximately to the leakage path determined 
by the maximum potential applied at the terminal. 
Terminal according to claim 1, characterized in that the insertion sleeve 
(6) is secured by means of locking projections (20) which are interlockable with 

recesses (17) in terminal housing (5). 
Terminal according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the insertion 
sleeve (6) has a tube (8) for guiding a connector lead (11,21) to terminal insert (1). 
Terminal according to claim 3, characterized in that the insertion sleeve  
 

(6) has an additional tube (7) axially parallel to the tube (8) provided for the guidance 
of the connector lead (11,21), whose central axis is at least approximately aligned 

with the axis of rotation of a screw (2) of terminal insert (1) in the interlocked state 

of the insertion sleeve (6). 
Terminal according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that, on insertion sleeve (6), supporting walls (23) are formed which laterally retain 

the terminal insert in the assembled state. 
Terminal according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
there is provided in terminal housing (5) an aperture or slot (9) for inserting an 

electrical connector, in particular one shaped like a soldering lug, leading to an 
electrical circuit, or to an electrical component, for example a coil (30). 
Terminal according to claim 6, characterized in that a seal is positioned 
between the slot (9) and the electrical connector shaped, for example, like a soldering 

lug (4). 
Housing in which there is inserted a terminal in accordance with one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the terminal housing (5) is 

inserted in the housing (25) and particularly a housing (25) for an igniter device for 
lamps, and extends beyond this by a few millimeters.
