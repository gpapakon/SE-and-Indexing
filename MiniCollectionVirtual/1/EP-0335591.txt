<ABSTRACT>
A marker post which can be quickly installed at the 
edge of a road comprising a flexible body (10) of part 

circular cross-section with an elongated metal base (12) 
preferably of T-shaped cross-section. To secure the 

post in place the body is flexed away from the base so 
that the base can be driven into the ground with a 

hammer. When the body is released it returns to an 
upright disposition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a marker post and more 
particularly but not exclusively a marker post for 
roads. Marker posts for roads, commonly known as verge 
markers or wayside markers are of two main types, rigid 
and flexible. In order to install the rigid posts 
they can be driven into the ground in the manner of a 
pile. For flexible posts special tools are needed if 
the post is to be driven into the ground without 
breaking the post. Although the posts themselves are 
not particularly expensive these special tools are 
relatively much more costly so that the overall cost of 
installation is high. An alternative to the use of 
special tools is to dig a hole for each post and fix 
the post in place with concrete poured into the hole. 
These procedures are time consuming and labour 
intensive. As a consequence the overall cost of 
installation is also expensive. The present invention has been made from a 
consideration of these problems. According to the invention there is provided a 
marker post comprising a flexible body portion and a  
 
rigid base portion, the flexible body portion being 
adapted to be flexed sufficiently to expose the top of 
the rigid base. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the 
body is made of flexible plastics material and the base 
is made of metal. The plastics material and the body 
shape should be of the kind which, for the purpose of 
installation, can be bent or flexed sufficiently to 
expose the tip of the metal base without permanent set 
so that when unrestrained the body will return to its 
normal position. Examples of shapes which are 
suitable are disclosed in European Patent 0103578. The metal base is preferably of profiled section 
for example T-shaped, U-shaped, L-shaped, of box 
section or other suitable cross-section. The base may 
be unprofiled, for example of circular cross-section. 
The metal base is fixed to the lower end of the flexible 
body at a location below the top of the base. The top 
of the flexible body can be flexed away from the base 
to expose the top of the base which can then be driven 
into the ground by suitable means such as a hammer. 
When the flexible body is unrestrained it returns to its 
normal disposition. A specific embodiment of the invention will now be 
described by way of example with reference to the  
 
accompanying drawings in which:- 
Fig.1 is a rear elevation of a marker post; Fig.2 is a vertical section through the post of 
Fig.1; Fig.3 is a section on the line III-III of Fig.1; Fig.4 is an under plan view of

<CLAIMS>
1. A marker post comprising a flexible body portion 
and a rigid base portion, the flexible body portion 

being adapted to be flexed sufficiently to expose the 
top of the rigid base. 
2. A marker post as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
body portion is comprised of plastics material and is 

shaped such that it can be flexed at least to expose the 
top of the base without permanent set.
