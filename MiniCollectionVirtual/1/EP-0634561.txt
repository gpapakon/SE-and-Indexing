<ABSTRACT>
A sand screen for filtering particulate matter 
from formation fluid entering a well bore, comprises a 

plurality of generally tubular filter sections (20,22) and 
cooperating means (52,52a) whereby the sections can be 

axially snapped together. Means (54,56) are provided to 
prevent rotational movement. The joining can also 

simultaneously interconnect circumferentially spaced axially 
extending shunt tubes (40) secured to and passing internally 

through each of the filter sections (20,22). By utilizing 
snap-fit interconnections between the filter sections 

(20,22), instead of conventional threaded connections, the 
assembly of the sand screen can be made substantially more 

easily and quickly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to apparatus for 
completing downhole wells, and more particularly relates to sand 
screen apparatus for filtering particulate matter out of 
formation fluid entering the well bore to be flowed upwardly 
through the well flow conductor. In the course of completing an oil and/or gas well, it is 
common practice to run a string of protective casing into the 
well bore and then to run the production tubing inside the 
casing. At the well site, the casing is perforated across one 
or more production zones to allow production fluids to enter the 
casing bore. During production of the formation fluid, formation 
sand is also swept into the flow path. The formation sand is 
relatively fine sand that tends to erode production components 
in the flow path. In some completions, the well bore is uncased, and an open 
face is established across the oil or gas bearing zone. Such 
open bore hole (uncased) arrangements are utilized, for example, 
in water wells, test wells and horizontal well completions. One or more sand screens are typically installed in the flow 
path between the production tubing and the perforated casing 
(cased) or the open well bore face (uncased). A packer is 
customarily set above the sand screen to seal off the annulus in 
the zone where production fluids flow into the production tubing. 
The annulus around the screen is packed with a relatively coarse 
sand (or gravel) which acts as a filter to reduce the amount of 
fine formation sand reaching the screen. A work string and  
 
service seal unit (SSU) is used to spot the packing sand around 
the screen. During well completion, packing sand or gravel is also 
pumped and squeezed into the producing formation around the 
screen for filtering unconsolidated material out of the inflowing 
well fluid. The packing sand is pumped down the work string in 
a slurry of water or gel and is spotted directly under the packer 
or above the sand screen. The packing sand also fills the 
annulus between the sand screen and the well casing. In well 
installations in which the screen is suspended in an uncased open 
bore, the sand or gravel pack supports the surrounding 
unconsolidated formation. Sand screen structures are typically constructed, prior to 
their operative placement in a well bore, from a plurality of 
generally tubular axial filter sections disposed in an end-to-end 
orientation in which facing end portions of each axially adjacent 
filter section pair are threadingly secured to a connection 
collar

<CLAIMS>
A sand screen for separating particulate material 
from formation fluid in a well, which screen comprises a 

plurality of generally tubular, axial filter sections 
(20,22) coaxially disposed in an end-to-end orientation, 

with facing end portions of each axially adjacent pair of 
said filter sections being in a telescoped relationship; 

and cooperating means (52,52a) on each pair of telescoped 
end portions for releasably joining them in an axially snap-fitted 

relationship, said cooperating means being operative 
to substantially preclude relative axial and rotational 

movement between each telescoped pair of said end portions. 
A sand screen according to claim 1, wherein each 
of said filter sections (20,22) includes a perforated 

tubular mandrel (34) having opposite end portions (30,32), 
and a porous tubular outer body member (24) outwardly 

circumscribing said mandrel (34) and having opposite end 
portions (26,28) axially inset from said opposite end 

portions (30,32) of said mandrel (34). 
A sand screen according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said cooperating means (52,52a) are disposed on said 

opposite end portions (30,32) of said mandrel (34). 
A sand screen according to claim 1, 2 or 3, which 
includes a circumferentially spaced series of axially 

extending shunt tubes (40) carried on each of said filter 
sections (20,22), the shunt tubes (40) on one (20) of each 

axially adjacent pair of said filter sections being 
telescopingly engaged with the shunt tubes on the other (22) 

filter section. 
A method of assembling a sand screen structure 
useable to separate particulate material from formation 

fluid in a well, said method comprising the steps of 
providing first (20) and second (22) generally tubular 

filter sections each having an end portion; axially 
inserting said end portion of said first filter section (20) 

into said end portion of said second filter section (22) to 
a telescoped relationship therewith; and creating, in 

response to the performance of said axially inserting step, 
an axially releasable, snap-locked relationship between the 

telescoped end portions in a manner substantially precluding 
relative axial and rotational movement therebetween. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein each of 
said first (20) and second (22) filter sections includes a 

perforated tubular mandrel (34) having opposite end portions 
(30,32), and a porous tubular outer body member (24) 

outwardly circumscribing said mandrel (34) and having 
opposite end portions (26,28) axially inset from said 

opposite end portions (30,32) of said mandrel (34), and said 
axially inserting step includes the step of axially 

inserting an end portion of one of said mandrels into an end 
portion of the other of said mandrels. 
A method according to claim 6, which further 
comprises the steps of coaxially mounting a split locking 

ring (52) externally on an end portion (30) of one of said 
mandrels (34), and forming an interior side surface groove 

(52a) on an end portion (32) of the other of said mandrels 
(34), and said creating step includes the step of causing 

said locking ring (52) to snap into said groove (52a). 
A method according to claim 7, wherein said method 
further includes the step of forming an anti-rotation 

projection (54) on an end portion (30) of one of said 
mandrels, and an axial end slot (56) on an end portion (32) 

 
of the other of said mandrels, and said creating step 

further includes the step of causing said anti-rotation 
projection (54) to enter said end slot (56). 
The use of a sand screen as claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 4, for filtering particulate matter from a 

formation fluid. 
A downhole tool string which includes a sand 
screen as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4.
