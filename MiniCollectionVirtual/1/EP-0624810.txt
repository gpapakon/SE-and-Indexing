second flange (12b) formed to have a greater 
diameter than other portions, a stopring (14) 

provided outside of the ferrule (12), having on its 
inner peripheral surface a first step (14a) and a 

second step (14b), a coil spring (13) having one end 
contacting with the first flange end face and the 

other end contacting with the first step end face, 
its tip exerting a spring force in an axial 

direction towards outside from the stopring; and a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
fiber connector unit which, in a process for
assembling an optical fiber connector with an
optical fiber cord (hereinafter referred to as
"assembly"), is able to simplify the assembly in an
automatic assembly line and provide labor-saving in
the assembly by a manual work, and to an optical
fiber connector having the optical fiber connector
unit.In contrast to fusion splicing for permanently
connecting optical fibers, an optical connector is a
joining device capable of detachably connecting
optical fibers with one another, and there have
heretofore been used various types of optical
connectors which can easily connect and disconnect
optical fibers.To promote further popularization of wide area
information services including video information to
individual homes and offices, an economical optical
fiber connector is essential. Heretofore, an
optical fiber connector is composed of a number of
parts, which have been highly dependent on manual
work for assembly. As a result, 50% of the total 
cost is accounted for by the assembly cost, which
has impeded reducing the cost of the optical fiber
connector. Therefore, in order to meet large
amounts of needs for optical connectors in the
future and provide an economical optical fiber
connector, it is necessary to automate the assembly
work, thereby improving the productivity and
reducing the assembly cost.To achieve an automatic assembly apparatus for
optical fiber connector at a reasonable cost, it is
necessary to simplify the mechanism and assembly
process as much as possible. For this purpose, it
is preferable to reduce the number of components of
the optical fiber connector and simplify the
structure of the connector so that the assembly
process can be simplified.Main optical fiber connectors which are
presently being used are broadly divided into a
bayonet fastening such as an ST-type connector and a
push-pull fastening type such as an SC-type
connector.The ST-type connector, which was developed by AT
& T of the United States, has a structure in which a
ferrule and a spring are preassembled with a bayonet
coupling nut, and the three parts (ferrule, spring,
and coupling nut) are integrated and supplied.Figs. 1A to 1C are schematic views showing the
connector structure and assembly procedure of the
ST-type connector. As shown in Figs. 1A to 1C, a
ferrule to hold an optical fiber 101a and an optical
fiber strand 101b having a jacket is previously
incorporated in a bayonet type coupling nut 104
together with a spring 103
