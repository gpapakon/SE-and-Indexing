<ABSTRACT>
A cryogenic rectification system for producing lower 
purity oxygen wherein a higher pressure feed air stream (8) is 

used to reboil the bottoms of a lower pressure column (60) and a 
lower pressure feed air stream (6) is fed directly into a 

higher pressure column (59).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cryogenic 
rectification and more particularly to the production 
of lower purity oxygen. The cryogenic rectification of air to produce 
oxygen and nitrogen is a well established industrial 
process. Typically the feed air is separated in a 
double column system wherein nitrogen shelf or top 
vapor from a higher pressure column is used to reboil 
oxygen bottom liquid in a lower pressure column. The demand for lower purity oxygen is increasing 
in applications such as glassmaking, steelmaking and 
energy production. Less vapor boilup in the stripping 
sections of the lower pressure column, and less liquid 
reflux in the enriching sections of the lower pressure 
column are necessary for the production of lower purity 
oxygen which has an oxygen purity of less than 98.5 
mole percent, than are typically generated by the 
operation of a double column. Accordingly, lower purity oxygen is generally 
produced in large quantities by a cryogenic 
rectification system wherein feed air at the pressure 
of the higher pressure column is used to reboil the 
liquid bottoms of the lower pressure column and is then 
passed into the higher pressure column. The use of air 
instead of nitrogen to vaporize the lower pressure 
column bottoms reduces the air feed pressure 
requirements, and enables the generation of only the 
necessary boil-up in the stripping sections of the 
lower pressure column either by feeding the appropriate  
 
portion of the air to the lower pressure column 
reboiler or by partially condensing a larger portion of 
the total feed air. While the conventional air boiling cryogenic 
rectification system has been used effectively for the 
production of lower purity oxygen, its ability to 
generate liquid nitrogen reflux for supply to the top 
of the lower pressure column is limited. This results 
from the lower component relative volatilities at the 
operating pressure of the higher pressure column which 
is similar to that of the main air feed. More power is 
consumed because oxygen recovery is reduced as a result 
of the reduced capability to generate liquid nitrogen 
reflux. US-A-4 410 343 discloses a method for producing lower purity oxygen comprising: 
(A) providing a cryogenic rectification plant comprising a main heat exchanger, a 
medium pressure column with a top condenser and a low pressure column with a 
bottom reboiler, said medium column operating at a pressure which exceeds that of 
the low column; (B) providing a first feed air stream at a pressure of 462
