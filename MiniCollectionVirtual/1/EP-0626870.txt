<ABSTRACT>
A system for the irradiation of certain forms of cancer with broad spectrum radiation via optic fibres and optic probes is described. Optic fibres (10) and (11) are introduced into or in close proximity to cancerous tissue by means of optic probes (13) in such a way as to avoid unnecessary irradiation of adjacent healthy tissue. The UV energy destroys cancer cells while the IR energy heats up the tissue, thereby enhancing the effects of other forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or ionising radiation. UV and IR radiation may be administered via optic fibres simultaneously with conventional radiation or chemotherapy, or the UV and/or IR radiation may be administred separately or in combination on the completion of conventional treatments. Radiation levels from radiation sources (1) and (2) are controlled by a computer (21) and a control module (18). By means of a communication fibre (16) and a picture fibre (15), the course of the treatment may be followed on a monitor (17), data recorded on a printer (22) and shown on a computer display (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Systems for Irradiation of Cancer with Broad Spectrum Radiation by Means of Optic Fibres and Optic ProbesThe invention relates to a system for broad spectrum infra red and ultra violet irradiation of cancerous tissue while avoiding the irradiation of adjacent healthy tissue. The radiation is delivered via optic fibres and optic probes placed into or close to the treatment site.The application of radiation physics to induce hyperthermia in living tissue to a controlled level (normally 40 - 45 C), is a relatively new technique, but it is established that hyperthermia will enhance the effectiveness of conventional ionising radiation. At the same time there has always the problem of how to heat up just the affected tissue and not adjacent healthy tissue. Many methods of inducing hyperthermia now exist, for example, R.F. and microwave heating, magnetic induction, ultrasound, and hot water capilliaries .The latter depends upon conduction for heat transfer and has little depth of penetration. (See for example Tor Vergata Monograph Series Vol. 1993 Hyperthermia and E.S.H.O. June 1993 Brussels Book of abstracts.) The other methods are all necessarily complex in design and operation, requiring probes (applicators) which are sensitive to small changes m parameters and may suffer 

from loading effects.U.S.A. Patents no. 5-151-096 and 5-050-597, and D.D. Pat.no. 296-616 are examples of the use of lasers as radiation sources. Lasers are complicated and operate at discrete wavelengths, requiring complex control systems and sometimes water cooling of the probes (applicators), (as shown for example in U.S. pa .no.5-050-597) m order to ensure thermal uniformity of the site, which may be influenced by secondary heating effects due to conduction.Applicators of the complexity required by such systems are not easy to manufacture, or, because of their size and shape , to implant, whilst direct laser beam radiation of a site results in hyperthermia induced by conduction from the heated irradiated area into surrounding tissue, which may be destroyed in the process.Such drawbacks are avoided in the system described here which is characterised in claim one (1) and with probes also described in claim two (2).The system described in this invention is essentially different from those referred to above in that it is relatively simple in design, manufacture and operation. It employs wide band infra red energy in the range of 700 - 10.000 nm (Nanometer) , and/or ultra violet energy in the range of 100 - 400 n . The energy is conveyed
