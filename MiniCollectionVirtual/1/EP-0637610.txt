<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of laminar articles by slush molding polyolefin 
compositions in powder form, said process being particularly 
suitable for the preparation of synthetic leather for 
automobile interiors. Generally, said synthetic leathers require, among other 
things, softness, soft touch, capability of maintaining designs 
embossed in them and of resisting whitening after impact and 
bending. The Applicant has now found that synthetic leathers having 
the above characteristics, and in particular displaying unusual 
softness, without experiencing any specific process problems, 
can be obtained by using powders of particular polyolefin 
compositions in slush molding processes . In order to obtain such a high degree of softness, one 
must use in the polyolefin compositions great quantities of 
elastomeric polymer, which do not have good flowability in the 
molten state. Thus, it is surprising that due to the use of the 
polymer compositions defined below, the slush molding process 
of the present invention can be carried out easily and enables 
synthetic leathers to be obtained with no irregularities and 
very homogeneous. JP-A-2 057 309 discloses a manufacturing process carried out by 
rotary moulding a powder of a thermoplastic elastomer containing 
a polyolefin resin and an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer rubber, 
the rotating mould being heated to melt the thermoplastic polymer. Even if it is explained that also a non crosslinked ethylene-α-olefin 
rubber can be used, a partial crosslinking of the rubber 
is preferred. In fact, crosslinking is carried out in all the 
examples. On the contrary, the compositions employed in the process of the 
present invention allow to achieve the best results in slush 
moulding without requiring any crosslinking of the rubber. Therefore, the present invention provides a process for 
the manufacture of laminar articles, in particular synthetic 
leathers, comprising slush molding a polyolefin composition  
  
 
in powder form, said composition containing the following 
fractions: 
A) 10-40 parts by weight, preferably 20-40, of an isotactic 
propylene homopolymer with an isotactic index higher than 
80, preferably from 85 to 98, or a random copolymer of 
propylene with ethylene and/or a C4-C10 α-olefin having the 
formula CH2=CHR, wherein R is an alkyl radical with 2-8 
carbon atoms, said copolymer having an ethylene and/or C4-C10 
content from 1 to 10% by weight, and an isotactic 
index, in boiling n-heptane, higher than 80; B)
