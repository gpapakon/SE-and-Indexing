<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder head is formed from a basic housing mounted on a cylinder block, which housing carries inlet and exhaust ports and valves, from a camshaft and bearing housing, supporting bucket tappets, and from a cylinder head cover. This cover is integrally formed with the upper parts of the camshaft bearings. The arrangement has a single parting plane on which both the basic housing with rising outer walls and the bearing housing and the cylinder head cover abut. The said arrangement has great rigidity and is easy to assemble.

<CLAIMS>
A cylinder-head arrangement of an internal-combustion engine, with a base housing (2) 
which comprises gas-exchange ducts (3) and valves controlling them and which is 

mounted on a cylinder block, and with a bearing housing (9) for mounting at least one 
camshaft (13), wherein the said bearing housing (9) comprises at least lower bearing 

parts (11) of the camshaft (13) formed integrally therewith, and with a cylinder-head 
cover (16), wherein the upper parts (17) of the camshaft bearing (12) are integral with the 

cylinder-head cover (16), 
characterized in that
 the cylinder-head cover (16) has a 
flanged face (18) bounded by both the outer walls (6, 7) of the base housing (2) and the 

matching faces (20) of the bearing housing (9). 
An arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it has a single separation 
plane (
T-T
) which is bounded by the base housing (2), the bearing housing (9) and the 
cylinder-head cover (16) and in which the flanged face (18) is situated. 
An arrangement according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 starting from a median 
longitudinal plane (
M-M
) bolt fastenings (21, 22, 23) are arranged on both sides in 
planes 
(E1, E2, E3)
 parallel thereto, wherein longitudinal axes (14) of the camshafts (13) 
extending in the separation plane (T-T) extend between the first and the second plane 

(
E1, E2
). 
An arrangement according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 first, second and third bolt 
fastenings (21, 22 and 23) are supported at one end on the cylinder-head cover (16) while 

passing therethrough, and the first and third bolt fastenings (21 and 23) are supported at 
the other end in the base housing (2) and the second bolt fastenings (22) are supported at 

the other end in the bearing housing (9). 
An arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized 
in
 that the matching surfaces (20) 
of the bearing housing (19) are arranged between the second and the third plane (
E2
 and 

E3
). 
An arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized in that fourth bolt fastenings (24) 
arranged in a fourth parallel plane (
E4
) hold the bearing housing (9) adjacent to receiving 
means (15) for flat tappets on the base housing (2).  

 
An arrangement according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 longitudinal axes (14) of 
the camshafts (13) are arranged to extend between the first and the fourth plane (
E1
 and 

E4
).
