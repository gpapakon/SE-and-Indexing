each of the bank has an array of a discharge typed logic 
circuit for decoding a micro-code, a command code is 

inputted to each bank every cycle for executing a 
predetermined command, and each bank outputs bank selection 

data for determining by which bank a command of a 
next cycle be decoded at the previous cycle, and a 

control circuit (24, 25, 26, 271 to 274, 281 to 284, 291

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a programmable logic array
(PLA) for decoding a micro code in a one-chip microcomputer,
a microprocessor (MPU), and a microcontroller (MCU) according
to the preamble of claim 1.Such a programmable logic array is, e.g., described in EP-A-0
428 300.In general, a PLA for micro code has an AND array section for
an input of the micro code and an OR array section for an
output of decode.The AND array section is formed to be an AND typed or an OR
typed. The AND typed AND array section is characterized in
that the area of the section is small and the section is
formed on a semiconductor chip. The OR typed AND array
section is characterized in that the speed of an operation of
the section is high.FIG. 1 shows one example of a conventional PLA for micro-code.In the PLA, the AND array section is formed to be AND typed.Reference numeral 51 is an AND typed AND array section, 52:
an OR array section, 53: an address input buffer circuit
provided on an input side of the AND array section 51, 54: a
clock input buffer circuit provided on an input side of the
AND array section 51, and 55: an output latch circuit
provided on an output side of the OR array section.The buffer circuit 53 increases a PLA input signal IR〈m〉, and
supplies the signal to the AND array 
section 51 as a command code. The buffer circuit 54
increases a precharge-discharge signal (Pre/Dis
signal)and supplies the signal to the AND array section
51 and the OR array section 52.The AND array section 51 comprises a plurality of
NAND circuits arranged in a column direction X, and a
plurality of inverter circuits 511, which inverts each
of outputs of the plurality of the NAND circuits, and
inputs these outputs to the OR array section 52.Each NAND circuit comprises one P channel MOS
transistor 512 for precharge wherein a source is connected
to a power supply voltage (Vcc) node, one N
channel MOS transistor 514 for discharge wherein a
source is connected to a ground voltage (Vss) node,
and a plurality of N channel MOS transistors 513
connected in series between a drain of the P channel
MOS transistor 512 and a drain of the N channel MOS
transistor 514.The OR array section 52 comprises a plurality of
NOR circuits arranged in a row direction Y, a word line
extending in a row direction Y, and a decode output
wire (bit line) extending in a column direction X.Each NOR circuit comprises one P channel MOS transistor
521 for precharge wherein a source is connected
to a power supply (Vcc) node and a plurality of N
channel MOS transistors
