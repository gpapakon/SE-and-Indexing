<ABSTRACT>
A telecommunications system is required by the system operator to have a high 
availability, especially in so far as the central processing is concerned, as failure of this can render 

a significant portion of the system inoperative. 
A telecommunications system has connected to an interface at least two remotely attached 
computing platforms, each of which is arranged to receive, process and provide a response to 

each functional request from the interface, the system responding to the first response received 
from the computing platforms. 
The computing platforms may provide high availability, while themselves being low 
availability devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
A telecommunications system is required by the system operator to have a high
availability, especially in so far as the central processing is concerned, as failure of this can
render a significant portion of the system inoperative.IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 28, No. 8, January 1986, Pages 3272- 3273,
"Parallel processor architecture to control multiple independent telecommunications switching
nodes" describes a parallel processor architecture which permits the use of many smaller
processors to do the job that once required a larger, more expensive computer. A large
telecommunications switching system may be architectured in varying degrees of centralized
dependency versus distributed autonomy. Many systems are distributing switching capacity in
smaller nodes attached to a central host. All processors in a group may return or initiate a
message top any nodeAccording to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications system having
connected to an interface thereof a plurality of remotely attached computing platforms, each
computing platform being arranged to receive, process and provide a response to each functional
request received by it from the system interface, characterised in that each functional request is
directed to all of the plurality of computing platforms and that the system responds to the first
response received from the plurality computing platforms.Preferably, the computing platforms are low availability platforms. The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying single figure, in which is shown a possible minimum configuration for Mirrored
Asynchronous Processing (MAP).In a telecommunications system having additional adjunct or remote processing the high
availability of the system is maintained by mirroring the functional interface requests and
discarding the redundant responses.Currently most of the telecommunications systems manufactured are of the stored 
programme control (SPC) type, i.e. they feature a central processing unit (CPU). The trend with
the Intelligent Network concept is to move the processing of services to the centre of a
telecommunications network.Mirrored Asynchronous Processing (MAP) is a functional protocol which allows
telecommunications processing to be centralised onto a plurality of standard and hence potentially
cheap, computing industry platforms, which individually may exhibit a relatively low availability,
whilst retaining the telecommunications system high availability.Of course

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunications system having connected to an interface thereof a plurality of
remotely attached computing platforms (#P,#P'), each computing platform (#P,#P') being

arranged to receive, process and provide a response to each functional request received by it from
the system interface, 
characterised in that
 each functional request is directed to all of the plurality
of computing platforms (#P,#P') and that the system responds to the first response received from

the plurality of computing platforms (#P,#P').
A telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the computing platforms
(#P,#P') are low availability platforms.
A telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the system monitors
the functionality of all the computing platforms (#P,#P') by identifying the response if any from

each further computing platform (#P,#P') and comparing the response with the first response.
A telecommunications system as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the system includes
an Intelligent network.
