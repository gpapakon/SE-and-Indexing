<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a radiation (e.g., UV or
visible light) curable adhesive comprising a predominant amount of
an acrylic capped organic prepolymer; a lesser amount of an ethylenically
unsaturated diluent monomer; a minor amount of a non-reactive
release agent (especially a vinyl ester of a saturated oil acid) and
a suitable photoinitiator as a blocking/deblocking adhesive in the
manufacture and processing of optical lenses, including, but not
limited to ophthalmic lenses, telescopic lenses and microscopic lenses.
Such lenses may be comprised of glass, polycarbonate
or other thermosets or thermoplastics.Various methods and means have been employed to mount individual
lens blanks in a blocking tool which can be detachably connected to a
spindle of an abrading machine in order to generate, grind and polish
a surface on the lens. Conventional procedures utilized heretofore
have employed a blocking pitch or wax to adhere the lens blank to the
block so that the same may be processed. Such pitches have tended
to be considered more or less trade secrets in the optical industry
and have varied in accordance with the type of lens and glass composition
to be ground, as well as the methodology and apparatus
employed in the grinding process itself. Among other things,
however, conventional pitches are known to include such materials as 
asphalt, coal tar, pine tar, rosin, beeswax, paraffin, shellac,
turpentine, etc. in different proportions. Such pitches required
considerable cooking and processing whereby cooking time and/or
turpentine content was varied to alter the consistency or "temper" of
the pitch, particularly with respect to its flow characteristics
under processing conditions. Early forms of pitch had considerable
flow at temperatures of over 30.5-33.3째C (90-95째F). Since such temperatures are
typically attained in grinding processes employing fast grinding
speeds and/or significant pressure at the interface of the lens blank
and the grinding element itself, more advanced, higher temperature
pitches were ultimately formulated. Such pitches now attain flow
temperatures of 60-93째C (140-200째F) and higher.While higher temperature pitches tend to allow for faster processing
speeds and grinding pressures, they inherently transfer some
of this heat to the lens blank during the bonding step creating
thermal gradients within the glass resulting in lens "springing" or
warpage. This warpage is particularly noted and magnified in lens
geometries having a diameter-to-center thickness ratios (i.e.,

A method for bonding a lens or lens blank,
both hereinafter designated as "a lens blank",

to a support member for subsequent
working, said method comprising the steps of :


i) applying a radiation curable adhesive material to the bonding surface of a support
member, said adhesive material comprising from 45 to 80% by weight of an acrylic

capped organic prepolymer resin terminated at both ends with acrylic functionality, from
5 to 35% by weight of a monofunctional ethylenically unsaturated diluent monomer, up

to 6% by weight of a non-reactive releasing agent and from 0.001 to 5% by weight of
a photoinitiator and wherein the acrylic capped organic prepolymer resin is selected

from the group consisting of (meth)acrylated urethane, (meth)acrylated polyester
urethane, (meth)acrylated polyepoxide, (meth)acrylated poly(alkyleneoxide),

(meth)acrylated polybutadiene and mixtures thereof,
ii) placing the lens blank upon the adhesive coated surface and aligning the
same, and
iii) allowing or enabling said adhesive material to bond the lens blank to the
support member.
A method for producing a lens comprising the steps
of:


i) providing a radiation curable adhesive as defined in claim 1, a lens
blank, as defined in claim 1 and a support member:
ii) interposing the adhesive between the lens blank from (i) and the said support member to form a
lens blank/support member assembly;
iii) exposing the lens blank/support member assembly to radiation so as to
polymerize the adhesive;
iv) subjecting the lens blank to working and/or treatment so as to form the
lens blank into a desired lens; and
v) separating the lens from the support member.
The method as claimed in claims 1 or 2 wherein the adhesive composition
comprises:


a) 50-70% of the acrylic capped organic prepolymer resin; 
b) 10-30% of the monofunctional ethylenically unsaturated diluent monomer;
c) 0-3% of a monomer having plural (meth)acrylic functionalities;
d) 0.5-5% of at least one vinyl ester of a saturated oil acid as the non-reactive
releasing agent;
e) 0-20% of a poly(alkyleneoxide) (meth)acrylate having three or more
alkyleneoxide repeat units or a saturated C
10
 or higher hydrocarbyl
(meth)acrylate;
f) 0-10% of a silica thixotrope; and
g) 0.001-5% of the photoinitiator, along or in combination with an
equivalent amount of a photosensitizer.

is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols, alkoxylated fatty alcohols, fatty

acid amides, fatty acid esters, metallic soaps, paraffin and polyethylene waxes and vinyl

prepolymer resin comprises one or more (meth)acrylated polyester urethanes.
The method of claim 2 wherein the lens blank is bonded to the support member
by first applying the radiation curable adhesive to the support member, placing the lens

blank on the adhesive coated surface of the support member and fixturing the lens blank to
the support member by exposing the same to radiation for a brief period of time so as

to fixture the lens blank and support member assembly. 
The method of claim 8 wherein following the application of the adhesive to the
support member, an alignment sleeve is placed on the assembly prior to placement of

the support member on the same.
