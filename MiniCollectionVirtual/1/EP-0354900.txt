<ABSTRACT>
In order to optimize the storage running time and coding of characters of a given character supply in a pixel storage, the various characters are searched row after row for various pixel patterns (ZE) and only the rows (SP) having different pixel patterns (ZE) are stored. An indication concerning the pixel information on each of these rows (SP) is filed in the character storage, the pixel information on each matrix-row (SP) being predetermined by an initial print column, a description grid and a running length. The rows of the character matrix (ZM) to be printed in a single pass can thus be decoded in a purposeful way without having to read the whole pixel information on a character.
