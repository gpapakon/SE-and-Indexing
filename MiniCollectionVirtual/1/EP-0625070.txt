<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel porous bodies which
possess a relatively low density (generally less than
1.0 g/cm3, and a relatively high surface area (at
least 85 m2/g) as well as one or more other
beneficial properties such as pore volume and strength
characteristics, all of which are favorable for many
industrial applications, such as insulating materials,
fibers, absorbents, adsorbents, ion-exchange resins,
membranes and support materials for a wide variety of
uses. The porous bodies have an open-celled 3-dimensional
lattice structure. The novel bodies can be
flexible, semi-rigid or rigid. The invention also
relates to articles formed from the porous bodies,
modified forms of the porous bodies, processes for
preparing the porous bodies and articles formed
therefrom. The highly porous low density articles can
easily be modified chemically for a desired
application, for example, filtration and recovery of
organics or inorganics, specifically metals, as well as
supports for immobilizing enzymes. The porous bodies
can be prepared from polymeric materials. In many
instances, the porous bodies of this invention are
formed from hydrogels.Numerous attempts have been made to make low density
solid materials. For instance, low density materials
have been prepared from aerogels. Aerogels have been
made from iron and tin oxides, aluminas, tungsten,
biopolymers and, more commonly, silicas. The first
aerogels were produced in the early 1930's (Kistler,
Stanford University) by exchanging the water in sodium
silicate with an alcohol, and then removing the alcohol
under high temperature and pressure [8.1 MPa (81 bars)/240°C]. Using the same basic original technique, it was
possible to produce materials with densities in the
range of 0.03 to 0.3 g/cm3. For further detailed
information, refer to Kevin J. Anderson, " From
Aquagels to Aerogels", Materials Research Society
Bulletin, March 1991 During 1990, Hrubesh of The
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory modified the
technique by using a condensed silica form, base
catalyst and supercritical fluid extraction to achieve
porous solids of silica aerogels having ultra low
density of about 0.005 g/cm3(See Robert Pool Science,
247 (1990), at 807). One disadvantage of such materials
is that at these densities the porous solids are
expected to have limited strength properties. Secondly,
the aerogels can be somewhat difficult to modify
(chemically) for various commercial applications.
Another disadvantage of the Hrubesh method is the use
of the expensive supercritical fluid
