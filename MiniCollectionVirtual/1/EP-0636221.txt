A clearance detector for a compressed-air actuated disk 
brake comprising a caliper 
(2)
 which reaches around a 
brake disk 
(1)
 and on one side of which an application 
device 
(3)
 is arranged which, by way of at least one 
actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 and a pressure member 
(70, 
71)
 mounted on the end thereof facing said brake disk, 
acts on a brake pad 
(10)
 which, on the application 
side, is disposed in said caliper 
(2)
 to be displaceable 
with respect to said brake disk 
(1)
, an adjusting 
means 
(74)
 coupled in a rotationally fixed manner to 
said actuating spindle 
(72, 73)
 maintaining the clearance 
varying due to lining wear essentially constant 

and being coupled to an angle of rotation sensor 
(54),
 
the output signal of which corresponds to the current 

lining wear,
characterised by
 
an evaluation means which detects the value of output 

signal 
(A)
 of said angle of rotation sensor 
(54)
, 
determines the signal difference 
(D1, D2, D3)
 with the 
value of the preceding signal at every change of said 

output signal 
(A),
 compares the determined signal difference 

(D1, D2, D3)
 with empirically determined signal 
difference values of said output signal 
(A)
 of said 
angle of rotation sensor 
(54)
, and determines the 
current clearance from the result of the comparison. 
A clearance detector according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 said evaluation means compares the determined 
signal difference 
(D1, D2, D3)
 with values stored 
in a table wherein a corresponding clearance value is 

stored for each determined signal difference 
(D1, D2,
D3)
, and outputs the corresponding value as an output 
signal. 
A clearance detector according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised 
in that
 said evaluation means compares the 
determined signal difference 
(D1, D2, D3)
 with a predetermined 
limit value and generates a warning signal 

indicating an excessive clearance when this limit value 
is exceeded. 
A clearance detector according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 said evaluation means continuously 
detects the value of output signal 
(A)
 of said 
angle of rotation sensor 
(54)
. 
A clearance detector according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 said evaluation means detects the 
value of output signal 
(A)
 of said angle of rotation 
sensor 
(54)
 at the beginning of every braking operation 
and subsequent thereto. 
A clearance detector according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 said evaluation means samples 
output signal 
(A)
 of said angle of rotation sensor 
(54)
 
in a cyclic sequence, with the time interval between 

the sampling operations being selected to be smaller 
than the minimum duration of a brake application operation. 
A clearance detector according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 said evaluation means comprises a 
calculation means, preferably a microprocessor. 
A clearance detector according to one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterised in that
 the end of said adjusting means 

(74)
 facing away from said brake disk is coupled to a 
reducing gear 
(53)
 which reduces the revolutions executed  
 

altogether by said adjusting means 
(74)
 during 
the entire readjusting cycle to one revolution at the 

most, and the output from which actuates said angle of 
rotation sensor

A clearance detector according to claim 8, 
characterised 
in that
 said angle of rotation sensor comprises a 
rotary potentiometer 
(54)
, with the reducing factor of 
said reducing gear 
(53)
 being selected such that the 
revolutions altogether executed by said adjusting means
