<ABSTRACT>
An access-permitting system wherein all variable 
information relating to the authorization of the card within 

the access-permitting system, such as, for instance, with 
regard to the entrance(s) for which the card is valid and with 

regard to the point of time at or the period in which the card 
is valid, is provided on the card.

 
Each time again, this information is rendered valid for a 

limited period of time, by means of a special card 
reader/writer which, unlike the other card readers belonging 

to the system, is connected to a central processing unit.
 

Also, at the same moment, all information about access already 
permitted can be transferred from the card wherein this 

information is stored to the central processing unit.
 

An access-permitting system according to the invention 
requires hardly any costly connections between the central 

processing unit and the decentral systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an access-permitting system for 
permitting access to for instance buildings, spaces, 
installations, vehicles, services and/or computer systems, 
comprising at least one access card whereon or wherein 
information can be written and at least one access card reader 
with which information can be read from a card, which 
information is further processed by the system to determine 
whether a card can be permitted access. In such systems, known 
per se, cards are used, for instance in the form of magnetic 
cards, so-called smart cards having contacts according to the 
standard ISO-7816, contactless chipcards according to the 
standard ISO-10536, or programmable cards according to 
European patent number 0242906 in applicant's name, to permit 
access to a building, a space or, for instance, to the use of 
equipment. In these access-permitting systems, two main groups 
can be distinguished. In the first group, the identification code or the card 
number of the card presented is transmitted from a card 
reader, arranged for instance at an entrance such as a door of 
a space or building, or a terminal of a computer system, to a 
central processing unit, whereupon it is centrally determined 
whether the relevant card number has access at the location 
where the relevant card is presented. If this is the case, a 
signal is subsequently transmitted from the central processing 
unit to the relevant entrance, for instance to open the door 
or to permit the terminal access to the computer system. 
Hence, the proper operation of these access-permitting systems 
depends on the lines of communication between on the one hand 
the different entrances and/or access card readers and on the 
other hand the central processing unit. The proper operation 
of the access-permitting system also depends on the speed at 
which communication takes place along these lines of 
communication. In the second group of access-permitting systems, a 
processing unit is centrally arranged as well, also connected,  
 
via lines of communication, to card readers decentrally 
arranged at the entrances, the access information being 
present per card number in these decentrally arranged 
processing units. The advantage of this second group of 
systems is that for permitting access no communication need 
take place between the central processing unit and the 
decentral card reader, so that these systems react much more 
quickly and, in the event of failures, break down less quickly 
and not all at the same time.

<CLAIMS>
An access-permitting system for permitting access to for 
instance buildings, spaces, installations, vehicles, services 

and/or computer systems, comprising at least one access card 
whereon or wherein information can be written and at least one 

access card reader with which information can be read from a 
card, said information being further processed by the system 

to determine whether a card can be permitted access, 
characterized in that the card comprises all relevant 

information relating to the access authorization of the card 
within the access-permitting system, so that after reading the 

card it can be determined, without supplementary information, 
whether the card can be permitted access. 
An access-permitting system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the access card reader, after reading 

the relevant information from the card, determines whether or 
not, on the basis of said information, access can be 

permitted. 
An access-permitting system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the relevant information of the card 

comprises at least one point of time or at least one period 
for which the access authorization of the card is valid. 
An access-permitting system according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the access authorization of the card 

should be rendered valid again for each new authorization 
period, the access authorization expiring again after the new 

authorization period has ended. 
An access-permitting system according to claim 4, 
characterized in that the system further comprises a central 

processing unit having a card reader/writer connected thereto, 
while the card can be rendered valid for a new authorization 

period by the central processing unit via said card 
reader/writer. 
An access-permitting system according to claim 4, 
characterized in that the system further comprises a central 

processing unit having connected thereto at least one access 
card reader, while the card can be rendered valid for a new 

authorization period by the central processing unit via said 
access card reader. 
An access-permitting system according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in 
that at the moment when access is permitted 
after the card has been read by an access card reader, 

information about the relevant entrance, said information 
optionally including the point of time at which the access was 

permitted, is written on or in the card, said information 
being read out by the central processing unit when the card is 

read out by the central processing unit for extending the 
period of validity of the card by a new authorization period. 
An access-permitting system according to any one of 
claims 5-7, characterized in that for an indefinite time, the 

central processing unit each time extends the period of 
validity of a card by a new authorization period. 
An access-permitting system according to any one of 
claims 5-7, characterized in that for a predetermined time, 

the central processing unit each time extends the period of 
validity of a card by a new authorization period. 
An access-permitting system according to any one of 
claims 5-9, characterized in that for instance in the event of 

loss or theft of a card, the authorization information of said 
card is blocked in the central processing unit, so that the 

authorization of a card cannot be rendered valid again and the 
card loses its validity at the end of an expiring 

authorization period. 
An access-permitting system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the access 

authorization of the card is valid for at least one 
predetermined entrance at which an access card reader is 

arranged. 
An access-permitting system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the information on the 

card comprises an identity code of the card. 
An access-permitting system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the system comprises a 

plurality of access card readers, the information on the card 
comprising an identity code of at least one access card reader 

for which access can be permitted to the relevant card.
