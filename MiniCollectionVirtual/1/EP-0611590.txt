<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a filtration apparatus for 
flue gas, which removes dust from flue gas discharged 

from a burner using mainly solid fuel, wherein 
incombustible powder is introduced into the filtration 

apparatus upon detecting or foreseeing coming of unburnt 
combustible dust from the burner, or upon detecting or 

foreseeing a temperature rise of the flue gas, and the 
incombustible powder is suspended in the dust-containing 

flue gas to suppress combustion of the combustible dust, 
or to suppress the temperature rise of the flue gas, in 

the filtration apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
operating a filtration apparatus for flue gas 
(such methods are for example disclosed in JP-A-55088820 
and in JP-A-59041407), 
which 
comprises removing dust from flue gas discharged from a 
burner such as a refuse incinerator or a burner operated 
under pressure such as a pressurized fluidized bed 
combustion boiler (hereinafter simply referred to as a 
PFBC boiler) or a coal direct firing burner using mainly 
solid fuel such as coal, by means of a filtration 
apparatus such as a filtration apparatus equipped with 
ceramics filters, a louver separator, a cyclone 
separator, a multi-cyclone separator or a combination 
thereof, whereby the problem that flue gas containing 
a large amount of unburnt combustible dust is discharged 
by temporary incomplete combustion and the combustible 
dust introduced into the filtration apparatus catches 
fire, or that high temperature flue gas is 
introduced due to temporary abnormal combustion and the 
filtration apparatus is thereby thermally damaged, is  
 
prevented. A filtration apparatus equipped with ceramics filters 
is considered to be a key component for a power plant 
operated by a PFBC boiler or for a coal-gasification 
apparatus as a clean energy technology (with reduced 
amounts of NOx and SOx) of next generation using 
abundantly deposited coal as the fuel. Accordingly, many 
attempts are being made for practical use of such a 
filtration apparatus in various countries in the world. 
In particular, the power plant operated by a PFBC boiler 
is expected to be developed for practical use in the 
nearest future because of the simplicity of the system. For the burner of this type using mainly solid fuel, 
it is common to use e.g. natural gas, light oil, 
kerosine, rice hull, straw, wood or paper, as a starting 
fuel or auxiliary fuel. Incomplete combustion of solid 
fuel is likely to result when mixed fuels are burnt or 
when the load during the combustion of solid fuel 
increases. It has been found that in such a case, a 
large amount of unburnt combustible dust is discharged 
together with flue gas, and if the oxygen concentration 
in the flue gas increases, spontaneous combustion of the 
combustible dust occurs in the piping, in a cyclone as a 
preliminary rough filtration apparatus or in a filtration 
apparatus equipped with ceramics filters connected to the 
downstream of the cyclone, whereby a problem such as 
thermal damage of the piping or parts such as the ceramics  
 
filters, will arise. In the case
