<ABSTRACT>
A printing ink comprises a clear, transparent, polymeric carrier material and uniform, colloidal size charged color particles evenly dispersed therein. The carrier and the particles are adhesively bonded to one another so as to form a matrix which can collectively respond to an externally imposed electrostatic field to promote co-movement of a "bite" of ink to an imaging medium without change of the bulk particle/carrier ratio. During the printing process, the ink is melted and exposed to electrostatically charged latent image areas on a heated image cylinder, resulting in the transfer of the ink thereto in proportion to the electrostatic field strength. The ink exhibits a relatively sharp liquid-to-solid transition, thereby enabling rapid ink solidification and complete transfer from the imaging medium to the relatively cool printing substrate. Also disclosed is a printing method and apparatus that facilitate continuous, variable and on-demand color printing in conjunction with the ink. Use of essentially monodispersed, color-coated, colloidal size, spherical particles in the ink results in excellent color purity and chromaticity range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrothermal
printing, and more particularly to an improved
method of printing on a substrate.Traditional methods of printing utilize various types of
long-run print forms such as gravure cylinders, offset plates
or flexographic belts which carry a representation of the
desired image (the so-called "signature") suitably recorded
thereon. The print form is matched with a particular type of
ink having physical characteristics compatible with those of
the print form, thereby facilitating cycles of proper ink
uptake and ink release. For example, in gravure printing, the
gravure cylinder contains an imagewise pattern of depressions,
so-called "cells", that accept ink from an ink-feed roller and
subsequently deposit part of the ink under immense mechanical
pressure onto a printing substrate (such as paper). This
process generally requires low-viscosity inks having high
solvent contents in order to promote the ready release of the
ink from the gravure cells, even though large residual volumes
of the ink will remain in the cells after these are pressed
onto the print paper.Lithographic offset printing, another much-used process,
generally involves aluminum plates having imagewise signatures
recorded thereon, the signatures residing in rasterized ink-accepting
and ink-repellent areas comprising millions of print
dots. In contrast to gravure systems, whether a given plate
area will accept or repel ink is determined by its planar 
oleophobic and/or oleophilic surface characteristics rather
than by the presence of cells. A lithographic offset plate is
usually "imaged" by means of ultraviolet contact photography
with a sheet of silver film; this process permits subsequent
etching of the exposed plate raster-dot areas from an initial
ink-accepting state into a water-accepting state, while leaving
the unexposed dot areas in their original ink-accepting state.
Lithographic inks are hydrophobic, and exhibit high, paste-like
viscosities and contain relatively small amounts of solvent.The primary disadvantages of these traditional printing
methods stem from the tediousness and time-consuming
lengthiness of recording the precise signature needed on the
print member, and the inability to alter the imaged print
member. Indeed, the print member is always discarded after its
use. Due to the unalterable nature of the signature, the print
form can only function repetitively; that is, it must print
thousands of the same image signature in succession for later
collation, cutting, and binding.

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing on a substrate, comprising the steps of:

a) - establishing an imagewise electrostatic dot-like charge
pattern on surface of an image member;
b) - heating the image member;
c) - providing an ink comprising:

(1) a clear, transparent, insulative polymeric
carrier material which is solid at room

temperature and undergoes a relatively sharp
transition to relatively low-viscosity liquid

phase when heated to a specific temperature;
(2) coloured pigment particles each having an
electrostatic charge and being dispersed

within the carrier, the melting point of the
particles being well above that of the carrier

material;
d) - bringing molten ink into contact with the heated imagewise
charged surface of the image member, and thereby effecting

electrostatically the transfer of coloured particles onto the image
member, but only at those dots on the image member having an

electrostatic charge and in thickness proportional to the field
strengths emanating from each charged dot;
e) - bringing the image member momentarily into contact with
an unheated printing substrate to cause transfer of the coloured 

particles onto the substrate, thereby forming an image on the
printing substrate as it departs from the contact area;

   characterised in that:

the carrier material contains electrostatically polarisable
subagents, such that the liquid phase is responsive to an externally

imposed electrostatic field and is attracted to the source of the field;
the particles are of substantially uniform size, shape,
chemistry and structure and are uniformly dispersed within the

carrier material, the particles having a bonding affinity for the
carrier material;

   and in that:

the step of bringing molten ink into contact with the heated
imagewise charged surface of the image member effects

electrostatically the transfer of droplets containing both the carrier
material and the particles as an interactive fixed-ratio matrix onto

the image member;
the step of bringing the image member momentarily into
contact with an unheated printing substrate causes rapid

solidification of the imagewise ink droplets, and no ink residue
being left on the image member as it departs from the contact area;

and
f) - the method further comprises the step of continuously
writing new electrical signals onto the print member even while

simultaneously transferring ink to the print member and to the
substrate according to previously recorded signals.
The method of claim 1, wherein the coloured particles have a
refractive index which is substantially identical to that of the

carrier material.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising the step
of repeating steps (a) through (e) using a different coloured ink to

overprint geometrically congruent dots onto the remelted ink to
produce multilayer deposits which, in combination, produce either

an additive or a subtractive resultant colour.
The method of any preceding claim, further comprising the
step of repeating steps (a) through (e) using a clear, visually

transparent ink to add gloss to the printed areas and protect them
from ultraviolet radiation.
The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of
remelting, at least in part, the solidified ink prior to repeating steps

(a) through (e).
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of repeating
steps (a) through (f) but using an ink which is highly transparent in

the visible part of the spectrum but highly absorbent in the
ultraviolet and actinic parts of the spectrum, with the transparent

ink being overprinted only in those areas where coloured ink
droplets had previously been printed. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the thicknesses of molten ink
transferred to electostatically charged dots on the image member

are determined by electrostatic field strengths emanating form each
charged dot on the image member, the cohesion of the molten

carrier material being sufficient low so as to facilitate removal by
the charged dots of quantities of ink from an ink supply.
The method of claim 1 to 7, wherein the surface of the image
member is at least slightly phobic to the molten ink, thereby

preventing the deposition of even small amounts of ink in areas of
the image member where no electrical charges are present.
The process of claim 1 further comprising the steps of:

a. liquefying the solidified ink using heat; and
b. exposing the printing substrate to a strong electostatic
field to facilitate removal of the ink therefrom.
