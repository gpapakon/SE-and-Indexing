<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a sustained release 
pharmaceutical formulation containing morphine which is 

suitable for administration on a once daily basis, in a 
first aspect, an orally administrable sustained release 

dosage unit form contains morphine, or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as active 

ingredient, which formulation gives a peak plasma level 
at 1.0 to 6 hours after administration. In a second 

aspect, the formulation contains an effective amount of 
morphine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, 

characterised by a W₅₀ for the M-6-G metabolite or for 
morphine of between 4 and 12 hours. In a third aspect, 

the pharmaceutical dosage unit form is obtainable by 
compressing multiparticulates comprising a 

pharmaceutically active substance in a matrix of 
hydrophobic fusible material having a melting point of 

from 35 to 150°C, the dosage form optionally containing 
conventional tabletting excipients. In a further aspect 

of the invention, sustained release multiparticulates 
containing morphine or a pharmaceutically acceptable 

salt thereof are produced by mechanically working in a 
high-speed mixer a mixture of particulate morphine or a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a 
particulate, hydrophobic fusible carrier or diluent 

having a melting point from 35 to 150°C and optionally a 
release control component comprising a water soluble 

fusible material or a particulate soluble or insoluble 
organic or inorganic material at a speed and energy 

input which allows the carrier or diluent to melt or 
soften whereby it agglomerates, and breaking down the 

agglomerates to give controlled release particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in and relating to sustained release compositions and, more particularly,
is concerned with sustained release orally administrable dosage unit forms containing morphine, or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient.Morphine is an opioid analgesic well established for use in the treatment of pain, especially moderate to severe
pain. Morphine-containing compositions in sustained release form are currently commercially available as so-called
"twice-a-day" formulations, that is formulations having a duration of activity of 12 hours or more and accordingly requiring
to be administered twice a day.EP-A 377518 discloses a sustained release pharmaceutical pellet composition suitable for treating pain-associated
conditions in patients which comprises a core element including at least one active ingredient of high solubility; and a
core coating for the core element which is partially soluble at a highly acidic pH to provide a slow rate of release of active
ingredient e.g. a morphine compound, and wherein the active ingredient is available for absorption at a relatively constant
faster rate in the intestine over an extended period of time, such that blood levels of active ingredient are maintained
within the therapeutic range over an extended period of time. As reported in PCT/WO 94/22431 published on 13
October 1994, the preparations according to EP-A377518 exhibit a limited bioavailability, restricting the administration
to at least twice daily. EP-A 377518 and other prior art is also mentioned in PCT/WO 94/03161 published on 17 February
1994.It is one object of the present invention to provide a morphine-containing sustained release orally administrable
dosage unit form which has an effective duration of activity of 24 hours and, hence, is suitable for administration on a
once daily basis.It has surprisingly been found, in accordance with the present invention, that effective therapeutic activity over a
period of 24 hours may be obtained from a morphine-containing sustained release unit dosage form as defined below, which gives an in-vivo
peak plasma level relatively early after administration, that is from 1.0 to 6 hours after administration preferably 1 to 4
hours e.g. 1 to 3.5 hours.Accordingly, the invention provides an orally administrable sustained
release unit dosage form containing morphine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient in accordance with claim 1.It has been found that in a group eg. n=5, of
