A method is described enabling HCl and possible entrained CuCl 
particulate to be removed from a gas-vapour stream leaving a 

dimethylcarbonate synthesis reactor. The contaminant removal is 
effected by one of the process fluids used in a small quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for removing acid or saline 
contaminants from a gas-vapour mixture leaving a dimethylcarbonate 
synthesis reactor. Dimethylcarbonate (hereinafter known as DMC) is a widely used 
chemical product of great versatility, employed as such as a 
solvent or as a fuel additive; DMC is also an important 
intermediate in the synthesis of alkyl or aryl carbonates, which 
are used as synthetic lubricants, solvents, monomers for polymeric 
materials and for the preparation of isocyanates, urethanes, ureas 
and polycarbonates. The path currently most followed for producing DMC is based on 
oxidative carbonylation of methanol, in particular in the presence 
of CuCl as catalyst, in accordance with the reaction: 
2CH3OH + CO + ½O2 → (CH3O)2CO + H2OThe preparation of DMC in accordance with this reaction is 
described for example in US 4,218,391 and 4,318,862 in the name of 
the present applicant. Improvements to the processes described in said US patents are 
introduced in European patent applications EP-A-460,732 and EP-A-460,735  
 
in the name of the present applicant, the content of which 
forms part of the present application as reference. These 
applications describe a continuous DMC synthesis process in which 
the reaction products are removed from the reactor in the vapour 
phase. Leaving the reactor in this process there is a saturated 
gaseous stream containing vapour of the water/methanol/DMC system 
plus unreacted CO and O2, CO2 deriving from a second reaction and 
possibly inert gases present in the feed to the reactor (H2, Ar, 
N2 etc.). This gas-vapour mixture is passed through a condenser 
which separates a water/methanol/DMC liquid mixture from the 
uncondensable gases, which are largely recycled to the reaction. The water/methanol/DMC liquid stream is then fed to the separation 
section which by distillation and liquid-liquid separation 
recovers the DMC and the water produced, and recycles the 
unreacted methanol to synthesis. This process has however the drawback that the gaseous stream 
leaving the reactor is contaminated with a small quantity of 
hydrochloric acid of generally between 30 and 300 ppm by volume, 
which is released from the catalyst used in the reaction. In 
addition to HCl, the gaseous stream leaving the reactor can also 
contain small quantities of halogenated copper salts deriving from 
catalyst entrainment in the form of particulate and/or droplets of 
micron dimensions. The amount of copper transferred in this 
manner is generally between about

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing HCl and possibly copper salts from a 
gas-vapour stream leaving a DMC synthesis reactor, consisting of 

bringing said stream into contact with a fluid of the synthesis 
process 

consisting of a liquid stream in the form of a water/methanol/DMC mixture obtained by 
condensing the gas-vapour mixture leaving the removal chamber,  

 
at a temperature essentially equal to or less than the 

temperature of the stream itself, and condensing the vapour 
contained in the purified gas-vapour stream. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the process fluid 
used for removing HCl and copper salts is at the same temperature 

as the gas-vapour stream to be treated. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the quantity of 
liquid used for removal is between 0.1 and 1 kg of liquid mixture 

per Nm

 of gaseous stream to be purified. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the liquid used 
for removing HCl and possible copper salts is obtained partly by 

withdrawal downstream of the condenser and partly by recycling the 
actual liquid mixture leaving the removal chamber. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein an organic or 
inorganic base is added to the liquid used for removing HCl and 

possible copper salts. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the base is sodium 
or potassium hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the base is added  
 

to the removal liquid mixture in a quantity such that its ratio to 
the sum of HCl plus possible copper salts to be removed varies 

between stoichiometric 1:1 and 1.1:1.
