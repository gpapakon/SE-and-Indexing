<ABSTRACT>
Coin tester (10), with a main plate and a running-track carrier plate, between which is formed a coin-running path between a coin-insertion slot and an acceptance and a rejection channel (16,14), there being arranged on the running-track carrier plate at least one ramp-like coin-running track (19) which is assigned at least one sensor for testing authenticity, furthermore an acceptance switch (22) being arranged in front of the acceptance and the rejection channel (16,14) and a presence sensor (24,26) being provided behind the acceptance switch (22) in the running direction, and with means for preventing manipulation with coins (42) suspended on a thread (44), there being formed in a portion located between the main plate and running-track carrier plate a slot (32), the width of which is smaller than the thickness of the smallest coin (42) and which is arranged in such a way that, when the thread (44) attached to a coin (42) is tautened in a position of the coin (42) behind the running track, the thread (44) is moved into the slot (32) opened towards the thread (44).

A coin-testing device comprising a first main plate (18,18a) and a 
second plate defining a coin path therebetween extending between a coin inserting 

slot and an acceptance and a rejection channel (14,16,14a,16a), wherein at least a 
ramped first coin path (19,19a) is provided at one of said plates to which coin path 

at least a sensor for checking validity is associated, wherein an acceptance gate 
(22,22a) is provided upstream of said acceptance and rejection channel 

(14,16,14a,16a) and a presence sensor (24,26,24a,26a) is provided downstream of 
said acceptance gate (22,22a), and comprising a slot (32) provided between said one 

main plate (18,18a) and a second coin path (20,20a) attached thereto, the width of 
said slot being smaller than the thickness of the thinnest coin and said slot being 

arranged such that in a position of the coin beyond said second coin path (20,20a) 
pulling a string (44,44a) attached to a coin (42,42a) moves said string (44,44a) into 

said slot (42) open towards said string (44,44a), characterized in that said second 
plate is defined by a coin path carrier plate which includes said first coin path 

(19,19a) and which is pivotally arranged to be moved away from said main plate 
(18,18a) and that said second coin path (20,20a) defines a counterfeit path (20,20a). 
The coin-testing device of claim 1, characterized in that said slot (32) 
comprises at least a barb (40) retaining said string (44) when the string (44) is 

manipulated to be moved out of said slot (32). 
The coin-testing device of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said slot 
is open 
towards the free end of said counterfeit path (20,20a). 
The coin-testing device of claim 3, characterized in that said slot is 
defined by cooperating recesses (34,36) of said counterfeit coin path (20) and said 

main plate (18). 
The coin-testing device of one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that 
said barb (40) is provided at said coin path (20). 
The coin-testing device of one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the inlet end (38) of said slot (32) is widened.  

 
The coin-testing device of one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a 
slot (54) is provided in said acceptance channel (16a) downstream of said acceptance 

gate (22a). 
The coin-testing device of one of claims 1 to 7, comprising a controlling 
and evaluating circuit generating a credit signal or the like when a valid coin 

passes said presence sensor, characterized in that a further presence sensor (28,30) is 
located upstream of said acceptance and/or rejection channel (16,14) and that said 

credit signal is cleared when the second presence sensor (28,30) will be actuated in 
time after generating said credit signal.
