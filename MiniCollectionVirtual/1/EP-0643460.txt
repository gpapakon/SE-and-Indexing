<ABSTRACT>
Use is made of a semiconductor amplifier (AS1) fed back (10) through a filter (FP1) adjusted to a first wavelength ( lambda 1). An incident beam (34) at a second wavelength ( lambda 2), and amplitude modulated, extinguishes, or allows setting up of, self-oscillation in the loop. The modulation is therefore transposed from ( lambda 2) to ( lambda 1). Application to optical telecommunications.

Process for the transposition of an optical modulation of a wavelength 
(λ
2
) on an adjustable wavelength, characterized in that it consists of: 

using a semiconductor amplifier laser (AS1), whose output is relooped on the 
input by a feedback loop (10) provided with an optical filter (FP1) tuned 

to a first wavelength (λ
1
), the said means being able to self-oscillate at 
said wavelength (λ
1
), 
injecting into the semiconductor amplifier laser (AS1) an incident beam (34) 
having a second wavelength (λ
2
), said incident beam (34) being amplitude-modulated 
and passing alternately from a high level to a low level, 
regulating the modulation of this incident beam (34) in such a way that for 
the high amplitude level of the incident beam (34), the self-oscillation 

condition of the amplifier laser (AS1) relooped on the wavelength (λ
1
) will 
no longer be satisfied, the amplifier laser then performing a simple amplification 

of the signal at the second wavelength (λ
2
), whereas for the low 
amplitude level of the incident beam (34),
 the self-oscillation of the 
relooped amplifier laser (AS1) is reestablished, the amplifier laser (AS1) 

emitting on said first wavelength (λ
1
), 
the amplitude modulation of the incident laser (34) at said second wavelength 
(λ
2
) thus being transposed into a complimentary amplitude modulation at the 
first wavelength (λ
1
). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the amplifier laser 
(AS1) with its feedback loop (10) is able to self-oscillate on a plurality of 

modes of different wavelength, one of the wavelengths (λ
1
) being selectable 
by tuning the filter (FP1) placed in the feedback loop (10) to said wavelength 

(λ
1
) and the wavelength (λ
2
) of the incident beam (34) is set to another of 
the wavelengths, so that the transposition takes place from one mode to 

another. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that an air wedge (FP1) 
is used as the optical filter.
