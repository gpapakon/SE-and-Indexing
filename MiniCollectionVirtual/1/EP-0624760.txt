<ABSTRACT>
In a method for regulating a heating system with a heat generator (10) for heating up heating water and a heating water circuit (12,14) having a heating pump (18) as well as a heating valve (20), the circulation of the heating water in the heating water circuit (12,14) is effected by controlling the output of the heating pump (18). In this connection, the output of the heating pump (18) and hence the flow rate of the heating water in the heating water circuit (12,14) is controlled on the basis of the temperature difference between the flow temperature (Tv) and the return temperature (TR) of the heating water circuit (12,14). A heating system with regulation of the pump speed on the basis of a temperature difference can be adjusted more easily than a heating system with a conventional pressure-regulated heating pump.
