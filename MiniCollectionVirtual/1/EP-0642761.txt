<ABSTRACT>
A method of quantitatively determining bone salt with CT equipment, which comprises scanning a target site and samples 
prepared by mixing a water equivalent with a standard bone-salt equivalent in various proportions with CT equipment and determining 

the bone-salt density at the target site by referring to the CT values of the samples, wherein more acurate results are obtained 
by compensating error factors due to blood, fat and the like. The method comprises: the step (D4) of scanning a target site 

and samples prepared by mixing a water equivalent with a standard bone-salt equivalent in various proportions under one or 
more tube voltages and replacing the CT value corresponding to the water equivalent included in the CT value of each sample by 

the CT value obtained by the scanning of the blood or a standard blood equivalent to calculate a corrected CT value, and either, 
in the scanning under a single tube voltage, the steps (D5 through D7) of determining the bone-salt density on the basis of the CT 

value of the target site by referring to the correct CT values, or, in the scanning under two or more tube voltages, the steps (D60 
through D70) of determining the bone-salt density on the basis of the CT value of the target site while eliminating the influences 

of the fat and the like by referring to each corrected CT value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a CT system for
quantitatively determining bone mineral mass.
More particularly, the present invention
relates to a CT system for quantitively determining bone
mineral mass by a method, comprising scanning an
objective region together with plural samples produced
by mixing a water equivalent material (a material having
the same X-ray transmission rate as that of water) with
various ratios of a standard material equivalent to bone
mineral mass (a material having the same X-ray
transmission rate as that of bone mineral mass) and
determining the bone mineral density (BMD) of the
objective region with reference to the CT numbers of the
plural samples with various densities of the standard
material equivalent to bone mineral mass.Quantitative determination of bone mineral
mass is used for diagnosis of osteoporosis and the like. Quantitative determination of bone mineral
mass in bone marrow as an objective region will be
outlined hereinbelow.As shown in Fig. 8, phantom P is placed below
the waist of a subject. Then, scanning with a CT
scanner yields the image data of the cross section
including the bone marrow (for example, the third lumbar
vertebrae) and the phantom P. Herein, the phantom P
contains plural sample rods S1, S2,····, produced by
mixing a water equivalent material having the same X-ray
transmission rate as that of water with various ratios
of a standard material equivalent to bone mineral mass
which has the same X-ray transmission rate as that of
bone mineral mass.Then, detecting CT numbers A1, A2, ···· of the
sample rods S1, S2, ···· in the cross sectional image
data, a linear regression "e" representing the relation
between the CT number and the bone mineral density of
the standard material equivalent to bone mineral mass as
shown in Fig. 9 is calculated on the basis of the CT
numbers A1, A2, ···· and the densities of the standard
material equivalent to bone mineral mass in the sample
rods S1, S2, ····. The X axis represents bone mineral
density, while the y axis represents CT number. Then, detecting the CT number of the bone
marrow as the objective region in the cross sectional
image date, the bone mineral density of the bone marrow
is calculated on the basis of the detected CT number and
the linear regression "e". Such a CT system is for example
known from the french patent application FR-A-2 659 697.As illustrated in Fig. 10, however, the bone
mineral density calculated on the basis of the linear
regression "e" is sometimes inconsistent with the true
value.Fo
