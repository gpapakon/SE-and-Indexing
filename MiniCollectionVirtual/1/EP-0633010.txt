A turntable being a seat for disabled people, comprising a 
rotary plate (14) rotatably mounted on a base plate (12) 

and movable backwards and forwards between two end 
positions by means of a sliding plate (20) provided in a 

sliding guide (22) of the elongate base plate (12), wherein 
the base plate (12) is divided into a plurality of portions 

relatively pivotable about axes extending transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the base plate (12), characterised in 

that the base plate (12) is formed as a one-piece plastics 
member and a transverse groove (46), forming an 

articulation web (48) and starting from the bottom surface of 
the base plate (12), is provided between two relatively 

pivotable portions and extends over the entire width of the 
base plate (12). 
A turntable according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
articulation webs (48) are located on the upper surface of 

the base plate (12). 
A turntable according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
a group of three parallel transverse grooves (46) is provided 

in each longitudinal half of the base plate (12). 
A turntable according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a bolt (36) is arranged in a hole (32, 34) 

extending through the rotary plate (14) and the sliding plate 
(20) so as to be co-axial with the axis of rotation and is axially 

displaceably mounted and, in at least one of the two end 
positions of the rotary plate (14), is axially displaceable in a 

corresponding hole (30) in the base plate (12).  
 
A turntable according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
bolt (36) is axially displaceable between two stop positions, 

in which it is held by means of a spring arrangement (42), 
and in that the two end surfaces of the bolt (36) form finger-actuated 

surfaces.
