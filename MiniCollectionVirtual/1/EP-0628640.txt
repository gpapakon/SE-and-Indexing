<ABSTRACT>
Methods for multiplex amplification of target nucleic acid sequences using a single pair 
of primers. Defined sequences are appended to the ends of multiple target sequences as part of 

the amplification reaction so that no steps in addition to amplification are required. The target 
sequences with the appended defined sequences need not be isolated prior to amplification. In 

one embodiment for coamplification of two target sequences, a sequence corresponding to a 
terminal segment of the first target sequence is appended to one end of the second target 

sequence and a sequence corresponding to a terminal segment of the second target sequence is 
appended to one end of the first target sequence. Amplification of the two targets then 

requires only a single pair of primers. Alternatively, a single defined sequence may be 
appended to the 5' and 3' ends of any number of selected targets. All such modified target 

sequences may then be amplified using a single pair of primers which hybridize to the defined 

end-sequences.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to isothermal amplification of nucleic acid target
sequences, in particular to simultaneous amplification of multiple target sequences.In vitro nucleic acid amplification techniques have provided powerful tools for
detection and analysis of small amounts of nucleic acids. The extreme sensitivity of such
methods has lead to attempts to develop them for diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases,
isolation of genes for analysis, and detection of specific nucleic acids as in forensic medicine.
Nucleic acid amplification techniques can be grouped according to the temperature
requirements of the procedure. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR; R. K. Saiki, et al. 1985.
Science230, 1350-1354), ligase chain reaction (LCR; D. Y. Wu, et al. 1989. Genomics4,
560-569; K. Barringer, et al. 1990. Gene89, 117-122; F. Barany. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA88, 189-193) and transcription-based amplification (D. Y. Kwoh, et al. 1989. Proc.
Natl. Acad Sci. USA86, 1173-1177) require temperature cycling. In contrast, methods such
as strand displacement amplification (SDA; G. T. Walker, et al. 1992. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA89, 392-396; G. T. Walker, et al. 1992. Nuc. Acids. Res.20, 1691-1696), self-sustained
sequence replication (3 SR, J. C. Guatelli, et al. 1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA87, 1874-1878) and the QÎ² replicase system (P. M. Lizardi, et al. 1988. BioTechnology6,
1197-1202) are isothermal reactions. In addition, WO 90/10064 and WO 91/03573 describe
use of the bacteriophage phi29 replication origin for isothermal replication of nucleic acids.In general, diagnosis and screening for specific nucleic acids using nucleic acid
amplification techniques has been limited by the necessity of amplifying a single target
sequence at a time. In instances where any of multiple possible nucleic acid sequences may be
present (e.g., infectious disease diagnosis), performing multiple separate assays by this 
procedure is cumbersome and time-consuming. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202 and
4,800,159 describe the PCR. Although these inventors state that multiple sequences may be
detected, no procedure for amplifying multiple target sequences simultaneously is disclosed.
When multiple target sequences are amplified, it is by sequentially amplifying single targets in
separate PCRs. In fact, when multiple pairs of primers directed to different target sequences
are added to a single PCR, the reaction produces unacceptably high levels of nonspecific
amplification and background. An improvement on the
