<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal head consisting of one or more substrates, 
each of the substrates comprises a heating element (16), common 

electrodes (12) arranged on one of the sides of the heating element (16), 
and individual electrodes (14) arranged on the other side of the 

heating element. In the vicinity of the side edges of the 
substrate, the patterns of the two types of electrodes extend 

from the heating element (16) toward the upper edge and lower edge of 
the substrate corresponding to the top side and bottom side of 

the trapezoid, respectively, in such a manner as to be directed 
at an angle toward the central portion of the substrate. This 

enables a plurality of substrates to be manufactured with the 
same electrode patterns, and all the substrates to have the same 

data transfer direction to simplify the wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal
head applicable to output terminals such as printers, plotters,
facsimiles and, more particularly, to patterns of electrodes
for supplying heating signals to heating elements juxtaposed
on a substrate.A typical thermal head consists of a single relatively
small-sized substrate having thereon a heating element, common
electrodes, and individual electrodes. Through the electrodes,
the heating element is supplied with electrical power to
generate a heat. Thermal paper or ink film is brought into
contact with the heating element by way of a protective film.On the contrary, there is a recently increasing demand
for a large-sized thermal head for use in the output terminals
such as a CAD system. The large-sized thermal head is
preferably composed of a single thermal head substrate. In
this case, however, the heating elements or electrodes free
from any defect must be formed over a large area of the
substrate. The manufacture of such large-sized substrate will
therefore face a large technical difficulty, which is not
practical.In the prior art, therefore, a plurality of small-sized
substrates were arranged to constitute a large-sized thermal
head, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Pub. No. 2-72967. This will be described in detail with reference to Figs. 1
and 2. Fig. 1 shows, by way of example, a single thermal head
consisting of three transversely alternately arranged substrates
including substrates 10a and 10c having, in plan view, a substantially
trapezoidal shape, and a substrate 10b having an
inverted trapezoidal shape. Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of the
thermal head depicted in Fig. 1.On the substrates 10a, 10b, and 10c, alternately arranged
are comb-teeth-like common electrodes 12 and also comb-teeth-like
individual electrodes 14 on which a belt-like heating
element 16 extends. The heat is generated in the region of the
heating element 16 intervening between the common electrodes 12
and the individual electrodes 14 adjoining to each other.The edges of the substrates 10a, 10c and the substrate
10b adjoining to each other correspond to the oblique sides of
the trapezoid of each substrate. The edges of the substrates
10a, 10c and 10b (hereinafter, referred to as side edge
portions of the substrate) are formed at predetermined angles
3 and 3' making supplementary angles other than 90 degrees.
Moreover, the substrates 10a and 10c are displaced from the
substrate 10b by a distance L with respect to the paper feed
direction to thereby prevent the heating
