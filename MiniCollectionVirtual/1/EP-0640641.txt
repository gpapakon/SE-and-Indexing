<ABSTRACT>
In the process for preparing polysuccinimide by dehydration 
condensation of aspartic acid in an organic solvent, polysuccinimide can 

be obtained simply and suitably in industry by removing a portion or 
more of the organic solvent from the reaction mixture while charging to 

the reaction mixture an additional organic solvent containing less 
amount of water than that of the removed organic solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of
polysuccinimide which is a useful intermediate for a medicine, and
more particularly relates to a preparation process of high molecular weight
polysuccinimide by heating aspartic acid in an organic solvent and carrying out
dehydration condensation.Generally polyamino acids are often used as a model compound of
protein in the field of medicine and bio-chemistry. Polysuccinimide is
a precursor in the synthesis of polyaspartic acid which is useful as an
environmentally suitable and water soluble polymer, and additionally is
a useful intermediate in the synthesis of pharmacologically valuable
poly-(aspartic acid)-hydroxyalkylamide as disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication SHO 48-20638.As to preparation of polysuccinimide, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 80,
3361(1958) discloses a process for conducting heat condensation of
aspartic acid at 200 Â°C for 2-3 hours, however, the molecular weight
of polysuccinimide obtained by the process is about 10,000. J. Org.
Chem., 24, 1662(1959) discloses a process for conducting heat
condensation of a derivative of maleic acid, malic acid or aspartic acid
so as to prepare polysuccinimide having a molecular weight of 15,000 to
28,000, however, the process requires a step for synthesis of a
derivative being a raw material. J. Org. Chem., 26. 1084(1961)
discloses a process for heating aspartic acid in tetralin for a long
time, however, polysuccinimide obtained by the process has a low 
molecular weight and remarkable coloring.U.S.Pat. No. 3052655 discloses a preparation process of a copolymer
of aspartic acid copolymer or a glutamic acid in the presence of a
phosphoric acid, and Japanese Patent Publication SHO 48-20638 discloses
a process for carrying out the reaction in the form of a thin layer by
using 85 % phosphoric acid in a rotary evaporator to obtain high
molecular weight polysuccinimide. Although any of these processes
leads to polysuccinimide having a high molecular weight, it is
disadvantageous to industrialize any of the processes, because the
process leads to solidification of the reaction product and thus causes
difficulty in stirring and isolating operations and additionally is very
difficult to scale up. As a result, the process is unfavorable in
industry.Further, USP 4363797 discloses a process for conducting
polymerization in a high boiling point solvent such as diphenyl ether in
the presence of an ion exchange resin. However, polysuccinimide
obtained by the process has a molecular weight of about
