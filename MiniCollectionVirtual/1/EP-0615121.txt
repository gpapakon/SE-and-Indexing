Sampler for molten metal with a carrier body, in which 
a sample chamber and a pre-chamber, connected therewith in 

a sealing manner via an inflow opening, are arranged one 
behind the other in axial direction of the carrier body, in 

which the pre-chamber has an inlet canal leading through the 
carrier body, characterised in that the sample chamber (6) 

is held by means of a spring member (5) in axial direction 
against the pre-chamber (10). 
Sampler according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
spring member (5) is supported on a stop member (4) which is 

fixed in the carrier body (1). 
Sampler according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the stop member (4) has a recess in which the spring member 

(5) is mounted so as to be centred. 
Sampler according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the sample chamber (6) is arranged at the immersion end 

of the carrier body (1) and the spring member (5) is 
arranged at the end of the sample chamber (6) on the 

immersion side. 
Sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that in the inflow opening (7) a quartz 

pipe (8) is arranged which projects into the pre-chamber 
(10), in which the quartz pipe (8) is fixed by a shaped body 

(9) of fireproof material to the sample chamber (6) and in 
which the shaped body (9) lies against the side of the pre-chamber 

(10) facing the sample chamber (6). 
Sampler according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
shaped body (9) lies with a force fit against the sample 

chamber (6) and the quartz pipe (8) is fixed to the shaped 
body (9) by means of a fireproof cement.  

 
Sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the spring member (5) is formed from 

a spiral spring. 
Sampler according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
spring member (5) is a cylindrical spiral spring. 
Sampler according to one of Claims 4 to 8, 
characterised in that on the surface of contact of the pre-chamber 

(10), facing away from the immersion end, a second 
spring member (11) is arranged which is held against a stop 

(13) fixed in the carrier body (1). 
Sampler according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
surface of contact facing away from the immersion end is 

constructed as a cover plate (12). 
Sampler according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the tensional force of the spring 

members (5;11) amounts to 30 N to 100 N. 
Sampler according to Claim 11, characterised in that 
the tensional force of the spring members (5;11) amounts to 

approximately 60 N. 
Sampler according to one of Claims 4 to 12, 
characterised in that the stop member (4), arranged at the 

immersion end, is constructed as a measurement head (2) to 
receive sensors (3).
