<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
fomentation to be used as an external anti-inflammatory
analgesic and, in particular, it relates
to a fomentation containing ketorolac (generic name),
which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic or
a salt thereof, as an efficacious ingredient.The compound used as the efficacious or
active ingredient in the present invention is
generally called ketorolac and the formal chemical
name thereof is (Â±)-5-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic
acid (or 5-benzoyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-1-carboxylic
acid).
Ketorolac was first synthesized by Syntex (U.S.A.) and
disclosed as a compound having a remarkable anti-inflammatory
analgesic effect in Japanese Patent
Gazette No. Sho 62-54109 (54109/1987). Examples of
the preparations containing ketorolac or its salt
include an internal remedy and an injection disclosed
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. Sho 61-191686
(191686/1986), and eye drops for local application
described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. Sho
58-172314 (172314/1983). Thus, only pharmaceutical preparations such
as internal remedies, injections or eye drops each
containing ketorolac were disclosed in the prior art,
but no plasters containing ketorolac were suggested at
all. Therefore, neither description of the
fomentation containing ketorolac nor description of
its formulation was found at all. Thus it was
extremely difficult to anticipate whether ketorolac is
usable as the efficacious or active ingredient of a
fomentation and an excellent fomentation can be thus
developed.As described above, no attention was directed
to the fomentation containing ketorolac as the active
ingredient and no investigation was made thereon
heretofore. As a matter of course, such a fomentation
has not been put into practical use as yet.Thus the inventors were interested in
ketorolac having a remarkable anti-inflammatory
analgesic effect in such conventional preparations as
above. After their intensive investigations made in
an attempt to obtain a fomentation in which ketorolac
exhibits a remarkable efficacious effect, the
inventors have found an unexpected fact that ketorolac
is difficultly soluble in a fomentation base and is
enclosed in the form of crystals therein. The
inventors have also found there are raised physical
problems of, for example, the compatibility of 
ketorolac with the base, the stability of the active
ingredient, and the reduction in exertion of the
medicinal effect due to a decrease in releasability of
the active ingredient

applied over said non-woven fabric, said coating being selected from plastic films

such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester films and from releasable
papers.
