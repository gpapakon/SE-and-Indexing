<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a digital 
computer system. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a system that detects cabling errors in a computer 
system that uses redundant communication paths between 
computer components. It is often useful to provide redundant 
communication paths (cables) in a computer system when cables 
couple one computer component such as a computer processor, an 
input/output device, or an external memory device to another 
computer component. The use of redundant communication paths 
between computer components allows operation of the computer 
system to go uninterrupted in the instance where one of the 
cables becomes disconnected. When redundant cables carrying the redundant 
communication paths between computer components are 
implemented in a computer system, it becomes difficult to 
visually distinguish between the cables and thus it becomes 
difficult to determine how to correctly connect the cables. 
Adding to this difficulty is the fact that it is typical for a 
large percentage of the cable coupling various components to 
be hidden from view when run through cabling conduit under a 
floor or above a ceiling. The difficulties in distinguishing 
between cables results in cables frequently being improperly 
connected during the setup of computer systems. It is possible to use cables with different 
distinguishing features to couple the various computer 
components together. Features used to distinguish cables 
could include different colored cables, different colored 
connectors, different shaped connectors, or identification 
numbers, among other features. However, in such a scheme, a 
master list must be kept that details which computer 
components and which port of each component each cable  
 
couples. Additionally, the use of different colored cables or 
different shaped or colored cable connectors requires 
distinguishing part numbers, and thus complicates inventory 
and set-up procedures. The present invention solves the above-described 
problems by providing a system that detects whether cables are 
incorrectly connected between computer components without 
requiring cables or cable connectors that physically differ 
from one another. One aspect of the present invention is to provide a 
computer system that is able to detect (1) when a cable from a 
computer component is disconnected, (2) when a cable is 
connected to an incorrect redundant port of the correct 
computer component, and (3) when a cable is coupled to an 
incorrect
