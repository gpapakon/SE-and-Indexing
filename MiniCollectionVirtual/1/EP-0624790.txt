<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an exhaust oxygen sensor (30) 
including a component (40,42) requiring electricity to 

operate such as a heater or oxygen electrode. A first 
electrical terminal (50) is provided in electrical 

contact with the component (40,42) and has at least 
one male prong (54). A second electrical terminal 

(60) in electrical contact with a wire (62) for 
delivering electrical power from an external source is 

also provided. The second electrical terminal (60) 
has at least one female connector receptacle (56,58). 

The male prong (54) and the female receptacle (56,58) 
are constructed and arranged so at least one of the 

first and second electrical terminals is removable 
with respect to the other terminal. In one embodiment 

of the invention, the sensor may include a threaded 
nut slidably received over a tubular housing, 

constructed and arranged to be threaded onto a 
threaded exhaust manifold boss without rotating the 

housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas sensors, and
more particularly to automotive exhaust oxygen sensors
having electrical connectors.Automotive exhaust oxygen sensors have
elements such as electrodes or heaters, which require
a supply of electricity for the operation thereof.
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates a
prior oxygen sensor 10 in which electrical power is
provided to a sensing element or a heater 12 through
permanent crimped contacts. The contacts have a
terminal pad 14 permanently connected, e.g., soldered
to the body of the sensor or to an associated terminal
pad on the heater. The contact at the other end
includes a crimped portion 16 which surrounds and
contacts a wire 18 supplying electrical power to the
component. The wire 18 then extends through a housing
body 20 and is connected to an external power source.
Assembling such a sensor requires the sensor body to
be permanently attached to a link of cable with an
interface connector. That assembly process is
extremely difficult and thus is undesirable. Many
added steps and special tools are required to connect
a sensor with an attached harness to a manifold boss.
The attached harness assemblies can tangle and nest
together making it difficult to pull out one sensor
from a bulk load. Two hands are required to screw the
sensor into a manifold to prevent the wires from
tangling. A special tool designed to fit around the
harness assembly and wires is required to tighten the
sensor into a boss on the manifold. Furthermore, the
wires must be secured to the engine prior to
installation of the sensor into the vehicle so that
damage to the wires and the vehicle interface
connector is prevented. EP-A-0 364 315 discloses a sensor in accordance
with the preamble of Claim 1. EP-A-0 398 625 and
US-A-4 469 626 disclose similar arrangements.The present invention overcomes the
deficiencies of these prior oxygen sensors.An automotive exhaust gas sensor according
to the present invention is characterised over EP-A-0 364 315 by the
features specified in the characterising portion of
claim 1.The invention relates to an automotive
exhaust gas oxygen sensor including a component
requiring electricity to operate, such as a heater or
electrode. A first electrical terminal having at
least one male prong is provided in electrical contact
with the component. A second electrical terminal is
provided in contact with a wire for delivering
electrical power from an external source. The second
electrical terminal has at least one female receptacle
for receiving a
