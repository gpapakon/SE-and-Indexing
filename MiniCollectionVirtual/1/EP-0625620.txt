<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a concrete form made of a thermoplastic 
resin which is obtained by thermally press molding a thermoplastic resin 

containing a predetermined amount of a glass fiber having a specific 
mean fiber length. A ceiling plate and ribs are integrally bonded as the 

same and one molding, the thickness t of the ceiling plate and the height 
h of the ribs satisfy the relations, t = 2.5 to 5 mm and 


t + h = 25 to 70 
mm 
 
, and if desired, patterns may be formed on a panel surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a concrete 
form made of a thermoplastic resin. As concrete forms, wood products have been 
mainly used, but they have been disadvantageous, for 
example, in that they are heavy and moreover too 
damageable to be used for a long period of time. In 
addition, such concrete forms have been disadvantageous 
in that products produced by assembling a panel (e.g. 
plywood) and crosspieces in a working site are used as 
the concrete forms, resulting in a low working 
efficiency. All of the panel surfaces of conventional 
concrete forms are smooth, and therefore when a natural 
stone such as marble or a surface-decorating material 
such as tiles is attached to a smooth surface obtained 
by concrete placing by the use of the conventional 
concrete forms and the surface of a concrete panel 
(these surfaces are hereinafter generically referred to 
as "concrete surface"), an adhesive, cement mortar or 
the like is usually applied on the concrete surface, 
followed by adhesion.  However, when the surface-decorating material 
is attached by such a method, the bond strength between 
a bonding layer and the concrete surface is not sufficient, 
so that in some cases, the surface-decorating 
material peels from the concrete surface together with 
the adhesive layer to cause an unexpected accident. 
Furthermore, when the peeling occurs at the high place 
of a multistory building or the like, repair has been 
very difficult and dangerous. In view of such conditions, the present 
inventors investigated in order to remove the defects of 
conventional concrete forms made of wood and develop a 
practically effective concrete form made of a thermoplastic 
resin, and consequently found that a concrete 
form made of a thermoplastic resin by a hot-press molding 
method by using a thermoplastic resin containing a 
specific amount of glass fiber with a specific length, 
and employing a specific relationship between the 
thickness of a top plate and the height of ribs, is free 
from the above-mentioned defects and can be used very 
effectively as a concrete form, and that previous 
formation of concave patterns and convex patterns on the 
surface of the concrete form is very effective in 
improving the bond strength between a concrete surface 
formed by concrete placing and an adhesive layer by  
 
roughening the concrete surface, whereby the present 
invention has been accomplished. Fig. 1 shows one example of the concrete form 
made of a thermoplastic resin of the present invention 
which is seen
