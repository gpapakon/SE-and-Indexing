<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic material suitable for 
use in the production of a multicolor filter array element, to such 
element and a multicolor liquid crystal display device incorporating 
such element. Liquid crystal display devices are used nowadays in numerous 
applications such as clocks, household appliances, electronic 
calculators, audio equipment, etc. There is a growing tendency to 
replace cathode ray tubes by liquid crystal display devices being 
favoured for their smaller volume and lower power consumption. In 
some applications like e.g. laptop computers and pocket TV's liquid 
crystal display devices are even without competition. High definition television in its ultimate version will require 
screen diagonals exceeding 50 inch (see P. Plezhko in the periodical 
Information Display September 1991, Vol. 7 no. 9, p. 19 a.f.). 
Although not yet in existence CRT-based 50 inch screens can be 
expected to be very impractical because of their weight and size. 
Liquid crystal technology is basically able to produce high 
definition television (HDTV) screens with moderate weight and size. Liquid crystal display devices generally include two spaced 
glass panels, which define a sealed cavity, which is filled with a 
liquid crystal material. The glass plates are covered with a 
transparent electrode layer which may be patterned in such a way 
that a mosaic of picture elements (pixels) is created. Full color reproduction is made possible by the use of a color 
filter array element inside the liquid crystal display device. Two addressing systems are used to drive the display : either a 
passive system or an active system. According to the passive system in the liquid crystal device the 
2electrode layers are patterned in a regular array of stripes. The 
stripes on one plate are perpendicular to those on the other plate. The application of a voltage across two opposing stripes causes 
a change in the optical properties of the liquid crystal material 
situated at the crossing point of the two stripes, resulting in a 
change of the light transmission through the energized picture  
 
element called pixel. According to the active system, which greatly improves the 
performance of the liquid crystal display device, each pixel has its 
own individual microelectronic switch, which means that such a 
microswitch is connected to an individual transparent pixel 
electrode, the planar size of which defines the size of the pixel. 
The microswitches are individually addressable and are three-terminal

A multicolor filter array element suitable for use in the 
production of a multicolor liquid crystal display device, wherein 

said element comprises on a glass support a pixelwise exposed and 
processed multicolor silver halide layer assemblage containing in a 

processed blue sensitive emulsion layer yellow pixels, in a 
processed green-sensitive emulsion layer magenta pixels, and 

containing cyan pixels in a processed red-sensitive emulsion layer 
which is the emulsion layer most remote from the glass support, and 

which pixels in superposition according to the principles of 
subtractive color photography yield a color matrix (mosaic) of blue, 

green and red pixels, and wherein said emulsion layer containing 
cyan pixels is coated with an organic resin to form a 

waterimpermeable covering layer, which covering layer for curing 
purposes has been thermally treated at a temperature in the range of 

50 to 200 °C, and wherein on top of the thus treated resin layer a 
transparent electrode layer is present, that is coated with a 

resinous alignment layer.
