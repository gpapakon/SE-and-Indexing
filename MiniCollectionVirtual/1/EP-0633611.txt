<ABSTRACT>
The insulated gate field effect device (Ia,Ib,Ic,Id) has a semiconductor body (2) with 
a first region (3) of one conductivity type, a second region (4) of the opposite 

conductivity type, a third region (6) of the one conductivity type (7) separated from 
the first region (3) by the second region (4) and at least one injector region (3) for 

injecting charge carriers of the opposite conductivity type into the first region (3). 
The conduction channel area (40) adjoining the insulated gate (9,10) has first and 

second subsidiary areas (40 and 40b) for providing respective first and second 
subsidiary conduction channels. The second subs
idiary area (40b) is spaced from 
the third region (6) and is more lowly doped than the first subsidiary conduction 

channel area (40a) for causing, when the injected opposite conductivity current type 
reaches a given value, the pn junction (40b') between the second subsidiary channel 

(40b) and the second region (4) to become forward-biassed causing the bipolar 
transistor formed by the second subsidiary channel (40b), the second region (4) and 

the first region (3) to conduct to initiate with the at least one injector region (8) 
thyristor action which ceases upon removal of the conduction channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device comprising an insulated-gate bipolar field-effect
device.Thus, the semiconductor device may comprise an
insulated-gate bipolar field-effect device having a semiconductor body comprising a first
region of one conductivity type, a second region of the opposite conductivity type
forming a first pn junction with the first region, a third region of the one conductivity
type forming a second pn junction with the second region and being separated from
the first region by the second region, at least one injector region for injecting charge
carriers of the opposite conductivity type into the first region, an insulated gate, a
channel area within the second region and adjoining the insulated gate,
which channel area is gateable by the insulated gate between a first
state in which a conduction channel of the one conductivity type provides a
conductive path for the flow of charge carriers of the one conductivity type between
the first and third regions and a second state in which the conduction channel is
removed, the device being such that initiation of thyristor action by the transistors
formed by the first, second and third regions and the injector, first and second
regions is inhibited.Such an insulated gate field effect device is generally now known as an insulated-gate
bipolar transistor (IGBT) or sometimes an insulated-gate transistor (IGT). This
and other types of combined MOS and bipolar devices are described in a paper
entitled "Evolution of MOS-Bipolar Power Semiconductor Technology" by B. Jayant
Baliga published in the Proceedings of the IEEE Volume No. 76, April 1988 at pages
409 to 418.An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) differs from a conventional insulated-gate
field-effect transistor in that, in the case of an enhancement type device, in the on-state
in addition to the current of the one conductivity type provided by carriers of
the one conductivity type flowing along the inversion channel induced by the first 
voltage applied to the insulated gate structure, a current of the opposite conductivity
type is provided by the injection of opposite conductivity type carriers into the first
region by the injector region. This injection of opposite conductivity type carriers into
the first region reduces the on-resistance of the device in comparison to that of a
similar construction conventional insulated-gate field-effect transistor or MOSFET.
As indicated by Baliga, the IGBT exhibits the desirable features of a MOSFET,
namely voltage controlled
