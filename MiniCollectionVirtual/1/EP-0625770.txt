<ABSTRACT>
An interactive method for monitoring road 
traffic consisting of detecting, using a short-range 

receiver installed on a vehicle, the presence of 
preceding vehicles in the same running direction and 

their dynamic conditions, as transmmitted by the 
preceding vehicles, in the form of binary coded 

periodic message at non-overlapped time intervals for 
each vehicle, and of transmitting, to the following 

vehicles using a short-range transmitter installed on 
the vehicle, a binary coded message indicating the 

presence of the vehicle and, optionally, dynamic 
conditions of the preceding vehicles, at time intervals 

non-overlapping the transmission intervals of the 
preceding vehicles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interactive
method for monitoring road traffic, as well as to an
onboard apparatus and a system for implementing the
method, that is a method and an apparatus for
broadcasting in real time information concerning road
traffic conditions, travelling speed, vehicle
acceleration/deceleration, headway, etc., hereinafter
collectively referred to as "dynamic conditions".The system and the implemented method are
directed to improve driving safety by ensuring real
time warning of potentially hazardous and/or difficult
traffic situations, thereby filling a long-felt need.Extensive investigation and research work has
been devoted to the development of traffic monitoring
systems which mostly employ fixed pickup stations for
integrating, processing, and broadcasting information
to road users.The detection and transmission arrangements
are mostly based on either radar, or inductive cable,
or radio, or steered wave transmission systems.Such monitoring systems have essentially the
following limitations:
updating is performed at long time intervals;local measurements are taken at far apart 
locations; andintegrated and averaged information is generated
which relates to the dynamic conditions of groups of
vehicles, not to the individual vehicles.Vehicle-to-vehicle interactive systems, based on
the use of radars or transponders to provide drivers
with indications of headway or distance (and its
variations) between vehicles, have long been proposed
but have been unsuccessful because either impractical
or limited by their purely local character, covering
vehicle pairs only.Examples of such systems are described in US-A-5,068,654
and GB-A-1,380,587.In particular US-A-5,068,654 describes a system in
which a central reference timing signal transmitter
provides a reference periodic timing signal which is
received by several vehicles.The vehicles are each provided with a transponder.
Each of the transponders is allocated a unique time
period for transmission, relative to the reference so
that the several transponders do not interfere in
transmission.Although the system overcomes the problem of
interference among several transmitting vehicles, it
can be usefully implemented at local level only 
involving a limited number of vehicles, which must be
always the same. Moreover each vehicle transmits
information related to its own dynamic state and does
not relay any information related to other vehicles.Similar limitations are present in GB-A-1,380,597
where the problem of transmission interference is
mini

An interactive method for monitoring road
traffic, consisting of detecting, through a receiver

(2) and a processor (5) installed on a vehicle, the
presence of vehicles travelling ahead in the same

running direction and their dynamic conditions, as
periodically transmitted, with a predetermined period,

in the form of a coded message from each of said
preceding vehicles, in transmission time windows of

said period, distinct for each vehicle, of detecting,
through said receiver (2) and said processor (5), at

least a transmission time windows in said period, not
used by any other preceding vehicle whose presence has

been detected, and of transmitting, through a
transmitter (1) installed on the vehicle, a coded

message indicating at least the presence of said
vehicle and dynamic conditions thereof to following

vehicles, during said detected at least one time
window.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the
range of said receiver (1) and transmitter (2) is on

the order of hundreds of meters.

an indication of the direction in which said vehicle is
proceeding.
