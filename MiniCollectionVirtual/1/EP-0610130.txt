<ABSTRACT>
In the context of this method, a doped semiconducting coating (10) has to be deposited on a disturbed surface (S) of a semiconductor base (9) doped by a dopant of the same type of conductivity as this coating. According to the invention, before deposition of a main layer (28) of this coating (10), an overdoped layer (24) is deposited, exhibiting a concentration of dopant higher than twice that of the average concentration of this coating. The invention applies especially to manufacturing a semiconductor laser for optical-fibre telecommunications systems.

top layer (8) of the base has a "restart" surface (S) whose
crystalline structure is disturbed; and
