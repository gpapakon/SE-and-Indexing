<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel liquid 
crystal monomer compound and a liquid crystal polymer obtained 
therefrom. Various polymers having liquid crystal 
characteristics have already been developed. Such polymers 
generally have the mesogen group represented by formula: 
   wherein X represents a direct bond, -(C=O)-O-, 
-(C=O)-NH- or -N=N-, R represents hydrogen, cyano 
group or methoxy group;
 
present in the polymer backbone (main chain type liquid crystal 
polymer) or in the side chain (side chain type liquid crystal 
polymer). Although the mesogen group shown above is 
introduced into the polymer via various bonds (e.g. ester bond), 
few polymers having urethane bond have been reported. In the main chain type liquid crystal polymer having 
a higher molecular weight, hydrogen bond characteristics of the 
urethane bond are considered to serve to bend the terminal of 
the molecule, whereby reducing the interaction of the mesogen 
group. Similar tendency is suspected also in the cases of side  
 
chain type liquid crystal polymers. Therefore, there are few 
studies on liquid crystal polymers having urethane bonds in their 
side chains. An objective of the present invention is to provide a 
side chain type liquid crystal polymer having urethane bonds in 
the polymer backbone as well as to provide monomer compounds 
to form such polymers. A liquid crystal polymer having 
(meth)acrylic main chain and acyl urethane bonds in their side 
chains is a novel compound. Accordingly, the present invention provides a liquid 
crystal monomer compound represented by formula (1): 
   wherein n is an integer of from 2 to 18, X is direct 
bond, -(C= O)-O-, -(C=O)-NH- or -N=N-, R¹ is 
hydrogen or a lower alkyl group, and R² is hydrogen, a 
cyano group or a methoxy group. The present invention also provides a liquid crystal 
polymer represented by the formula (2): 
   wherein m is an integer of 2 or more, n, X, R¹ and R² 
are the as mentioned above,
 
as well as a liquid crystal polymer obtained by polymerizing one 
or more of the liquid crystal monomer compounds represented by 
formula (1). The monomer compound (1) according to the present 
invention may be easily synthesized at a high yield by reacting 
an alkanoyl isocyanate represented by formula (3): 
   wherein R¹ is as defined above,
 
with an active hydrogen containing compound having a mesogen 
group represented by formula (4): 
   wherein n, X and R² are defined as above. The alkanoyl isocyanate (1) has already been provided 
by the present inventors,
