<ABSTRACT>
A printed circuit board includes an uncured substrate 
material (101) with closed voids which are disposed with a through-hole. 

When the through-hole is formed, voids which exist in the 
substrate material open from inner wall of the through-hole to 

form a hollow-shaped part (103a). By filling the through-hole and 
the hollow-shaped part with conductive paste (103), the adhesion 

improves by the increased holding effect between conductive paste 
(103) and the wall surface of the through-hole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printed circuit board used
for electronic devices, and further relates to a method of
manufacturing the printed circuit board.Recently, following the tendency of electronic devices
towards compact size and higher mounting density, multilayer
printed circuit boards have been strongly demanded, not only for
industrial but also for consumer use. This type of multilayer
printed circuit boards requires employing inner-via-hole
connections between a plurality of circuit patterns and also
requires high reliability.A conventional method of manufacturing a double sided
printed circuit board is described as follows. FIGS. 8 (a) to
(e) are cross-sectional views showing a method of manufacturing a
conventional double sided printed circuit board. First, an
insulating substrate 801 such as glass-epoxy is provided as shown
in FIG. 8 (a). Then, copper foils 802 are applied on both sides
of insulating substrate 801 as shown in FIG. 8 (b).
Subsequently, insulating substrate 801 and copper foils 802 are
bonded to each other through heating and pressurization.
Thereafter, by using a conventional technique such as etching or
the like, copper foils 802 are formed into a first circuit
pattern 805 and a second circuit pattern 806 as illustrated in 
FIG. 8 (c). Next, as shown in FIG. 8 (d), through-holes 803 are
drilled at places where first circuit pattern 805 and second
circuit pattern 806 will be electrically connected. After that,
conductive paste 804 is filled into through-holes 803 by a
printing process as shown in FIG. 8 (e), and the paste is
hardened.In the manner as described above, first circuit pattern
805 and second circuit pattern 806 are connected by conductive
paste 804 filled into through-holes 803, and thus, a double sided
printed circuit board 807 is obtained.However, the above-mentioned conventional structure has
the problem that adhesion between the conductive paste and the
wall surface of the through-hole is poor. In addition, there is
a gap in coefficient of thermal expansion between the conductive
paste and the insulating substrate so that a boundary face of the
conductive paste and the through-hole breaks due to the thermal
shock of solder dipping. As a result, a failure in continuity
occurs.US-A-4 967 314 relates to a circuit board construction
wherein a high density multi-level printed wiring board
comprises inter-level electrical connections made via
interconnect holes. The holes are drilled or punched through
only those layers of the wiring board that separate the two
layer
