<ABSTRACT>
A current sensor which makes use of the Faraday effect, which is patterned on a Sagnac interferometer and which employs a coil of spun birefringent optical fibre for sensing the magnitude of current flowing through a conductor about which the sensor is, in use, located. The sensor in its preferred form comprises a coil (10) of spun single mode birefringent optical fibre (11), the coil being arranged to locate about a conductor (12) through which current flow occurs. A beam splitting device (22) in the form of a 3*3 coupler is coupled with the ends of the coil fibre and is arranged to launch counter-propagating light beams into the respective ends of the coil fibre. A lasing light source (16) is optically coupled to the beam splitting device by way of a 2*2 coupler (21), and detectors (18) which are arranged to detect a phase shift between the polarisation modes of the counter-propagated light beams are optically coupled to the ends of the coil fibre by way of the beam splitting device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sensor, which employs a
sensor element composed of spun birefringent optical
fibre, for sensing current flow through a conductor.Current sensors which employ optical fibre are used
in high voltage systems, for example in electricity
generating and distribution systems. Such sensors make
use of the Faraday effect to provide a measure of
electric current flowing through a conductor and they
provide advantages over conventional measuring
arrangements that incorporate current transformers. The
sensors are light in weight, compact, relatively
economical to produce and, most importantly, are
electrically insulating.When light is subjected to the influence of a
magnetic field, with the direction of light propagation
aligned with the magnetic field, the right-hand
circularly polarised mode travels faster than the lefthand
circularly polarised mode. This produces a phase
shift, the Faraday effect, between the polarisation
modes, and the degree of phase shift is proportional to
the strength of the magnetic field. Hence, the phase
shift is proportional to the current that produces the
magnetic field, and the magnitude of current can be
inferred from a measurement of the degree of phase shift.
However, the Faraday effect is weak and a large number of
turns of optical fibre must be wound around a conductor
in order to achieve the fibre length required to provide
for a measurable phase shift.Spun birefringent optical fibre might be employed
with advantage in the formation of coils having large
numbers of turns because, unlike ordinary
telecommunications optical fibre, spun birefringent fibre
can be wound with a small radius without seriously
affecting polarisation properties. This facilitates the
manufacture of compact current sensors. However, a 
problem that arises from the use of spun birefringent optical fibre is that the phase shift between
intrinsic polarisation modes of such fibre changes with temperature. A small change in
temperature may produce the same phase shift as a large change in current flow through the
conductor and, whilst various techniques have been proposed to compensate for the temperature
sensitivity of spun birefringent fibre, these involving the introduction of temperature sensitive
orthoconjugate reflectors and broadband systems with back reflection.US-A-4370612 describes the use of an optical fibre wrapped around a conductor. A light beam
from a laser is coupled to both ends of the fibre through an optical separation and coupling circuit
including a beam
