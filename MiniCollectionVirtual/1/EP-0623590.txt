<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing alkali metal salts of cyanoacetone
by reaction of acetonitrile and an acetic ester,

the alcohol component of which is a substituted or
unsubstituted, straight-chain, branched or cyclic alcohol,

in the presence of alkali metal alkoxide, the
alcohol component of which is a substituted or unsubstituted,

straight-chain, branched or cyclic alcohol, at
temperatures from 40 to 160°C, 
characterized in that
 the
reaction is carried out without distilling off the

alcohol formed during the reaction.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the acetic ester contains from 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the
alcohol radical.
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 sodium methoxide and/or sodium
ethoxide is/are used as alkali metal alkoxide.
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 from 1 to 12 mol, preferably from
1.5 to 6 mol, of acetonitrile are used per mole of alkali

metal alkoxide.
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 from 1 to 2 mol, preferably from
1.5 to 1.7 mol, of acetic ester are used per mole of

alkali metal alkoxide. 
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that an alkali metal alkoxide and an

acetic ester of the same alcohol are used.
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the reaction is carried out at
temperatures from 40 to 160°C, preferably from 80 to

120°C, under autogenous pressure or at an increased
pressure of from 2 to 200 bar.
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the starting materials are charged
together and reacted.
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the acetic ester is added over up
to 10 hours, preferably up to 2 hours, under reaction

conditions to a suspension of alkali metal alkoxide in
acetonitrile.
A process according to at least one of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the acetic ester and/or a suspension
of alkali metal alkoxide in acetonitrile and/or

acetonitrile and acetic ester are fed to the reactor in
portions or continuously under reaction conditions.
A process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 mixtures of acetic esters
and/or of a plurality of alkali metal alkoxides are used

with each containing different alcohol radicals.
