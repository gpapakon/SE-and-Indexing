<ABSTRACT>
Each of a plurality of segment drivers for driving 
a liquid crystal display panel used in an electronic 

device includes a display data memory (46) corresponding 
to a display image plane. The display memory (46) is 

supplied with an X address and Y address from an address 
register (47) so that the data write area thereof can be 

specified. A control device of the electronic device 
outputs address data and display data to a connection 

bus (55) when data is stored into the display memory 
(46), and the segment driver writes transfer data into 

an addressed area when it is determined that the write-in 
process is effected for the segment driver itself by 

decoding address data by use of a decoder (53). When 
data stored in the display memory (46) is displayed, the 

Y address is automatically incremented in synchronism 
with a common signal by an increment circuit (50), and 

data of one line specified by the Y address is simultaneously 
read out from an output port (O128) of the display 

memory, converted into a segment signal via a latch 
circuit (51) and output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display driving
device in an electronic device operated by a
microprocessor built therein and, more particularly, to
a display driver having a display memory for storing
display data.In the conventional electronic data bank, for
example, a key input section and display section are
provided. Address data and schedule data which are previously
input and stored in a semiconductor memory by
the key operation are read out and displayed on the display
section when required.Generally, a liquid crystal display unit (known from e.g. GB-A-2 255 668) is used as
the display section of this type of electronic device.
Display data stored in a RAM used as the display memory
is read out and output to the display section as
follows as an instance. In particular, assume that an
8-bit data processing microprocessor is used and the
liquid crystal display unit is constructed by 160 dots
in height Ã— 128 dots in width, for example, and that,
when an 8-bit data bus is connected thereto and display
data is transferred from the RAM, the 8-bit data readout
operations must be repeatedly effected 16 times in order
to transfer one line of display data in a horizontal
direction.However, if the readout processes for 8 bits are
repeatedly effected for the display memory as described 
above, it takes a long time to read out the entire display
data, and the power consumption becomes large since
a large number of memory accesses must be effected.The present invention has been made in order to
solve the above drawback, and an object of the present
invention is to provide a display device in which the
display data readout time can be reduced and the power
consumption can be reduced.According to an aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a segment driving circuit of a liquid
crystal display panel for effecting the displaying operation
by selectively driving a group of common electrodes
and a group of segment electrodes, comprising a
display memory for storing display data displayed on the
liquid crystal display panel; an address data memory
having a write-in address register for storing data
write-in address data for the display memory and a readout
address register for storing data readout address
data; a data write-in circuit for writing data into the
display memory according to the address data stored in
the write-in address register; a data readout circuit
for reading out display data of one line for one common
electrode to be supplied to the segment electrode group
at one time from the
