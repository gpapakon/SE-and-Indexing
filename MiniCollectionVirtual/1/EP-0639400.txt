<ABSTRACT>
A modified large pore zeolite molecular sieve 
structure is disclosed for adsorbing alkenes emitted 

during engine start-up, before the catalytic converter has 
attained its effective operating temperature. The zeolite 

molecular sieve is modified by inserting certain metal 
ions into the molecular sieve structure. In particular, a 

modified y-zeolite having a high adsorption capacity for 
propylene is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of trapping or 
removing hydrocarbons from exhaust gases emitted from 
internal combustion engines before they are discharged 
into the atmosphere, using molecular sieve with non-framework 
cations. More specifically, this invention is 
concerned with overcoming pollution problems associated 
with engine start-up or "cold-start" in a by-pass exhaust 
system. Typically, seventy to eighty percent of hydrocarbon 
emissions from automotive vehicles are emitted during the 
first minute of engine operation, during which time the 
main catalyst has not attained light-off and is therefore, 
not active. The problem is made worse by the fact that 
the engine requires rich fuel-air ratio to operate during 
cold-start. Even though larger molecular weight hydrocarbons have 
been trapped by adsorption, low molecular weight alkenes 
have proved more difficult to trap by this method. Low 
molecular weight alkenes (olefins) are particularly 
troublesome in regard to emission control because they  
 
have a high propensity to form ozone, a major smog-forming 
constituent. Although zeolites may be quite useful for adsorbing 
or occluding many unwanted molecules, they may be 
subjected to thermal degradation, which can be of 
particular concern in in-line exhaust systems in which the 
zeolite is placed in series or in-line with the main 
converter, and downstream of a light-off catalyst. In 
such configurations, during use, the zeolite may be 
continuously exposed to temperatures of up to about 700 to 
800°C. Due to possible engine misfires, the absorber in 
such a system may also encounter temperature spikes as 
high as 1000°C, which can seriously undermine the thermal 
stability of zeolite absorbers. Also, zeolites have low 
desorption temperatures, causing desorption of trapped 
hydrocarbons before the catalyst attains its active 
temperature. While some of the previously suggested methods have 
provided some adsorption of certain hydrocarbons under 
certain operating conditions, there continues to be a need 
for better and improved, cost effective methods for 
reducing unburned hydrocarbons, particularly, ozone-forming, 
low molecular weight alkenes, from exhaust 
emissions during the critical cold-start period. Accordingly, it is the objective of the present 
invention to provide an improved hydrocarbon absorber 
capable of adsorbing significant amounts of ozone-forming 
low molecular weight hydrocarbons, particularly, 
propylene, as well as high molecular weight hydrocarbons 
from
