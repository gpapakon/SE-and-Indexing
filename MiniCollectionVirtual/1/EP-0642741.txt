<ABSTRACT>
Fish-feed for aquarium fish, characterized by the fact that it has a 
physical chemistry formulation, such to absorb water in a controlled 

manner, and specific initial weight lower than the water of the 
aquarium, with the aim that: 


when thrown onto water, it floats for a certain period; and 
then impregnating itself with water in a controlled way, it becomes 
heavier assuming a specific gravity slightly greater than the water of 

the aquarium, slowly depositing itself on the bottom, and 
 
furthermore characterized by the fact that it includes a substance 
which is heavier than water having the characteristic to disolve in 

water or reacting with it, determines a lightening of the specific 
weight of said feed, such to allow it to rise to the surface. 
 
 
Advantageously the rise to the surface is obtained with the addition to 

the fish-feed substantially made up of a product impregnable of water, 
of a substance, such to: 


be heavier than water; 
 
immersed in water dissolves slowly in it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention as a subject has a fish-feed for aquarium fish and 
respective production process. At the present stage of technology aquarium fish feed, particularly 
(even if not exclusively) for domestic use, is well known in the form of 
flakes, approximately 90%, and the fish-feed in granule pellets 4%, or 
extruded 1%. This fish-feed has the drawback of having a specific weight 
substantially heavier than the water of the aquarium after being 
drenched with water, therefore when it is not consumed it deposits itself 
at the bottom of the aquarium and rots, contributing to the degradation 
of the water pollution. This fact furthermore leads to the saturation (clogging) of water recirculation 
filters in the aquarium, with consequent poor functioning, 
risk of damaging the circulation pump because of overcharging, 
reduction of the water circulation with a worsening of aquatic life, 
necessity of greater frequency in the replacement of the filter and in 
conclusion greater maintenance, the more frequent emptying of the 
aquarium for a rational cleaning also being necessary, with all the 
problems that follow. To obviate the drawbacks described above floating fish-feed is also 
thought of, but it is known that in such case the permanent floating  
 
favours the oxidation and consequent rapid degradation of the feed, 
already full of water, because of the continuous contact with the air. Therefore the problem to solve is double, and the following would be 
necessary: 
a fish-feed heavier than the water for the fish that prefer to feed on 
the bottom, and a fish-feed lighter than the water that floats for fish that prefer to 
feed on the surface. The present invention, according to characteristics of the included 
claims, instead fully solves the problem in a simply unpredictable way, 
by means of a fish-feed for aquarium fish having an apparent specific 
weight comprised between 350 and 450 gr/l and a physical chemistry 
formulation, such to absorb water in a controlled manner, with the aim 
that: 
when thrown onto water, for said specific weight floats for a certain 
period of time, allowing a food supply to the fish that feed on the 
surface, then impregnating itself with water in a controlled manner, it 
becomes heavier assuming a specific weight slightly greater than 1000 
gr/l depositing itself slowly on the bottom in order to allow a food 
supply to the fish that feed on the bottom, finally, rises to the surface again. Advantageously the rise to the surface is obtained with the addition to 
the

and an initial specific weight lower than the water of the aquarium, 
with the aim that: 


when thrown onto water, floats for a certain period of time, and 
then impregnating itself with water in a controlled manner, it 
assumes a specific weight slightly greater than the water of the 

aquarium, slowly depositing itself onto the bottom, and 
furthermore characterized by the fact that it includes a substance 
heavier than the water, having the characteristic of being able to 

dissolve in or reacting with water, determining a reduction of the 
specific weight of said feed, such to allow it to rise again to the surface. 
 
Advantageously the return to the surface is obtained with the addition 

to the feed substantially made up of a product impregnable of water, of a 
substance, such to: 


be heavier than the water; 
immersed in water dissolves slowly in it. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that it has a specific 
apparent weight of 350-450 g/l. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that said substance, 
heavier than water is a water soluble substance. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that said substance, 
heavier than water is a substance that slowly reacts with the water 

forming gas bubbles. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that said substance 
contains calcium. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that said substance 
 

contains a calcium concentrate. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that said substance 
contains a calcium carbonate. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that said impregnable 
substance is a cereal flour and/or animal origin flour. 
Feed according to claim 1, characterized in that it has the following 
formulation: 


flour from cereals in weight proportion comprised between 40% and 
70%, preferably 57%; 
animal origin flour in weight proportion comprised substantially 
between 10% and 30%, preferably 20%; 
protein concentrates comprised substantially between 8% and 20%, 
preferably 13%; 
animal and/or vegetable fat comprised substantially between 3% and 
10%, preferably 6%; 
calcium concentrate comprised substantially between 2% and 7%, 
preferably 4%; 
possible various additives and integrated vitamins. 
Feed according to the preceding claims, characterized in that it has a 
expansive spongy form. 
Feed according to the preceding claims, characterized in that it has a 
form of curved long elements similar to small prawns. 
Feed according to the preceding claims, characterized in that it has a 
form of long curved elements similar to small prawns with length less 

than a centimetre and section of 0,5-3 mm. 
Production procedure of a feed according to the characteristics of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that it has the following phases: 


cooking extrusion at maximum temperature of 135°, considering a 
 

maximum water process contribution of 30% and fats for a maximum of 
10%; 
desiccation at 125° for 10/15 minutes 
immediate cooling.
