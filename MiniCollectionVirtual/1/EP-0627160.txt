<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a device for placing food (K) 
within the reach of one or more animals, comprising: 


a baffle-like element (2,33) against which food is 
deposited; and 
moving means (6,7,11,37,38) for moving the baffle-like element (2,33) 
to the feeding place (1,42). 
one or more guiding elements (12,41) which extend on or 
just above the floor, for guiding the baffle-like element (2,33) 

along the floor (B) upon movement by the moving means (6,7,11,37,38). 
With a device according to the present invention, 
only small adjustments need to be made to existing animal 

sheds. The arrangement of the shed can remain unaltered.

<DESCRIPTION>
Animal sheds, for instance cowsheds, are 
usually equipped with a feeding place where the cows are 
able freely to eat at their own pleasure. In contemporary 
practice, silage is also deposited at this feeding place 
for the animals by the farmer. From the European patent application 
EP-A-0061817, moveable feeding gates are known where 
large amounts of silage are deposited by the farmer in a 
central area, between two opposite, moveable feeding 
gates, these feeding gates being moved towards each other 
when the animals are no longer able to reach the food. It has been established that such moveable 
feeding gates lead to a greater silage intake of the 
animals which in turn leads to a decreased use of 
concentrate, thus yielding a saving in costs for the 
farmer. A disadvantage of these moveable feeding gates 
is, however, the sizable facilities which have to be 
provided in existing sheds. Further a device is disclosed in the European 
patent application EP-A-0043098 for shifting food blocks. 
This known device comprises a number of carriages which 
are driven by a single driving motor via, for instance, 
chains as guiding elements. Such a device makes access to 
the side away from the feeding gate impossible. 
Furthermore, the floor of an existing shed has to be cut 
out in order to install the guiding elements under the 
level of the floor. The present invention has for its object to 
improve upon the above apparatus of the prior art and/or 
to obviate the disadvantages associated therewith.  
 The present invention provides a device for 
placing food on a floor within reach of one or more 
animals, comprising; 
a baffle like element against which food is 
to be deposited; moving means for moving the baffle like 
element to a feeding place, said moving means comprising 
a driving motor and a shaft driven by said motor; and one or more guiding elements, comprising one 
or more chains operatively connected to said shaft for 
guiding the baffle like element along the floor upon 
movement by said moving means, characterized in that said 
driving motor is mounted on the side of the baffle like 
element away from the side where the food is to be 
deposited, and in that said guiding elements extend along 
the floor. With a device according to the present 
invention only small adjustments need to be carried out 
in existing animal sheds. The arrangement of the shed can 
remain unaltered. The baffle like element prevents the 
feed from coming into contact with the side away from the 
feeding gate. Because

<CLAIMS>
A device for placing food (K) on a floor 
within reach of one or more animals (C), comprising; 


a baffle like element (2, 33) against which 
food (K) is to be deposited; 
moving means (6, 7, 11, 37, 38) for moving 
the baffle like element (2, 33) to a feeding place, said 

moving means comprising a driving motor (6,7) and a shaft 
(7, 38) driven by said motor; and 
one or more guiding elements (12), comprising 
one or more chains (12) operatively connected to said 

shaft (7, 38) for guiding the baffle like element (2, 33) 
along the floor upon movement by said moving means, 


characterized in that
 said driving motor (6, 37) is 
mounted on the side of the baffle like element away from 

the side where the food is to be deposited, and in that 
said guiding elements (12) extend along the floor. 
A device according to claim 1, comprising a 
plate (18) spaced from the floor and extending at an 

obtuse angle, sloping downwardly from said baffle like 
element (2, 33), over such a distance that the balanced 

position of the baffle like element is maintained. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said moving means comprise a nestwheel (11) associated 

with the shaft and for engaging the chain (12). 
A device according to any of claim 1 - 3, 
provided with one or more wheels (19) for moving the 

baffle like element (2, 33) over the floor with minor 
friction. 
A method for placing food (K) at the feeding 
place on the floor within reach of one or more animals 

(C), comprising the step of moving the baffle like element 
(2, 33) with deposited food along one or more guiding  

 
elements (12) extending on or just above the floor 

in a first direction from a starting position towards 
said feeding place, characterized by returning said 

baffle like element to said starting position by securing 
the guiding elements to the floor at one or more locations 

(14) located at the side away from the feeding place 
relative to the baffle like element (2, 33), whereafter 

the baffle like element (2, 33) is moved along the guiding 
elements to the starting position and the guiding 

elements are loosened from said locations.
