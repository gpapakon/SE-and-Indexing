<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metering (dosing) device, especially for a viscous product. It comprises a body (14) which defines a metering chamber (24) provided with an opening (18) and with a pipe for introducing the product (22); a pipe (28) mounted movably in the chamber, a first end (32) of which is open, the pipe passing through the opening in a leaktight manner and being provided with at least one passage (38) which connects the chamber to the inside (40) of the pipe; a member (54) for closing off the passage, which member is mounted in the chamber; and a rod (44) for moving the pipe between an open position in which the end (32) projects out of the body and in which the passage (38) is not closed off and a closure position in which the end (32) projects out of the body by a substantially smaller length, in which the passage is completely closed off.

Dispensing device, particularly for a viscous product,
characterised in that it comprises:


a body (14) defining a dispensing chamber (24) provided
with an opening (18) at one of its ends and a conduit

for introducing said product (22);
a conduit (28) mounted so as to be moveable within said
chamber (24) with respect to said body (14), a first

end (32) of said conduit (28) being open and
constituting the outlet for the dispensed product, said

conduit (28) passing in an impervious manner through
the opening of said body (14), said conduit (28) being

provided with at least one passage (38) capable of
causing said chamber (24) to communicate with the

inside (40) of said conduit;
fixed means (54) for obturating said passage, mounted
in said chamber (24) and integral with said body (14);

and
means (44, 46) for displacing said conduit (28) between
an open position in which said open end of the conduit

(28) projects outside said body by a length M and in
which said passage (38) is not obturated by the

obturation means and a second, closed position in which
said open end projects outside said body (14) by a

length substantially less than M and in which said
passage (38) is totally obturated by said obturation

means (54), said displacement means (44,46) co-operating
with the second end (34) of said conduit

(28).
Dispensing device according to Claim 1, characterised
in that said fixed obturation means (54) integral with 

said body (14) and are arranged so as to obturate
totally said passage (38) when said conduit (28) is in

its second position and so as to unblock it completely
when said conduit is in its first position.
Dispensing device according to Claim 2, characterised
in that said conduit (28) is cylindrical, in that its

second end (34) is obturated, in that it comprises
several passages constituted by slots (38) made in its

wall and offset angularly and in that said obturation
means comprise a cylindrical sleeve (54) in which said

conduit can slide in an impervious manner, the length
(L) of said sleeve in the direction of displacement of

said conduit being at least equal to the dimension (L')
of said slots in said direction.
Dispensing device according to Claim 3, characterised
in that said displacement means comprise an axial

control rod (44), one end of which (42) is integral
with the obturated end (34) of said conduit (28) and in

that it further comprises a sealing bellows (48)
surrounding said rod, a first end (50) of said bellows

being integral with the obturated end (34) of said
conduit and the other end (52) of which is made

integral with said body (14).
Dispensing device according to any one of Claims 1 to
4, characterised in that said opening (18) of the body

(14) is provided with a gasket (37) co-operating with
the outer face of said conduit.
