<ABSTRACT>
A device (10,110) for loading bars in an automatic lathe 
comprises guide means (19, 119, 119') along which is 

supported and made to run a bar (12, 112) with leading end 
projecting from said guide means to be inserted in a lathe 

chuck (11, 111) to be grasped by handling means (21, 121) 
of the lathe moving parallel to the bar axis to feed the 

bar under machining tools (31, 131). At least a first part 
of the guide means (19, 119, 119') nearest the chuck has 

kinematic connection with the handling means (21, 121) for 
moving axially and substantially synchronously therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for sequentially 
loading bars in an automatic lathe. Specifically it 
relates to a bar loader having an improved bar guide 
system. Document FR-A-2 190 558 discloses a device for loading 
bars having the features of the preamble of claim 1. In the known art there are automatic lathes which receive 
sequentially by means of special loaders bars from which 
to make parts or machined sections. The loader inserts 
axially the end of a bar at the rear of the lathe chuck. The chuck comprises a clamp or headstock which grasps the 
bar and moves it axially beneath the machining tools for a 
length predetermined to be the actual length of the work 
to be machined. After completion of machining of the work 
it is cut off and the clamp withdraws by running along the 
bar to return to the starting position, grasp the bar 
again and again advance to feed beneath the tools the 
section to be machined. The sequence of operations is 
repeated until the bar is exhausted. At this point the 
loader withdraws the remaining bar stub, discards it and 
inserts a new bar in the lathe so that the machining cycle 
can resume automatically. There being inserted in the lathe only a short section of 
bar head, for the entire machining cycle the bar is 
supported at the rear by guide means integral with the 
loader structure. In known loaders, between the feed clamp 
and bar guide means there is however inevitably created  
 
progressively an ever greater space as the clamp moves to 
push the bar into the lathe. This allows bending and 
vibration of the bar which disturb machining performed by 
the lathe. In addition, the resonance vibrations produced 
in particular at the higher rotation speeds of the bar are 
difficult to damp by conventional methods of elastic 
suspension, the resonance frequency continuing to change 
depending on the breadth of the free space between the 
clamp and the guides. The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the 
above shortcomings by supplying a device for loading bars 
into automatic lathes which would minimise the free spaces 
between the lathe and the guide means for the bar in the 
loader and make as uniform as possible the guidance of a 
bar fed to the lathe chuck. In view of said purpose it is sought in accordance with 
the present invention to provide a device according to claim 1. To clarify the explanation of the innovative principles of 
the present invention and its advantages compared with the  
 
known art there is described below with

<CLAIMS>
Device (10, 110) for loading bars in an automatic lathe 
comprising guide means (19, 119, 119') along which is 

supported and made to run a bar (12, 112) with leading end 
projecting from said guide means to be inserted in a lathe 

chuck (11, 111) to be grasped by lathe handling means (21, 
121) moving parallel to the bar axis to feed the bar under 

machining tools (31, 131) and characterised in that at 
least a first part of the guide means (19, 119, 119') 

nearest the chuck is kinematicly connectable with the 

handling means (21, 121) for moving axially and maintaining 
the spacing between the end of the guide means and the 

handling means substantially unchanged during their movement.  
 
Device in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that 
at least a second part of the guide means following the 

first is made up of an aligned sequence of guide sections 
(119) moving in a supported manner in the direction of bar 

feed and interconnected in series by elastic connections 
(133) and the first section of the series being connected 

to said first part and the last section of the series 
being connected to a fixed point of the loader by further 

elastic connections (133, 134) in such a manner as to be 
entrained by the movement of the first part to draw apart 

and together substantially synchronously with said 
movement. 
Device in accordance with claim 2 characterised in that 
each elastic connection (133, 134) comprises stop elements 

(135) against withdrawing of the sections beyond a pre-set  
 

amount. 
Device in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that 
said at least one part of the guide means is supported by 

a truck (24, 125) running in the bar feed direction. 
Device in accordance with claim 2 characterised in that 
the guide sections (119) are each supported by a carriage 

(125) running on a guide (127) extending in the bar feed 
direction. 
Device in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that 
the guide means comprise a plurality of generally annular 

elements (19, 119, 119') mutually aligned to be traversed 
axially by the bar. 
Device in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that 
the kinematic connection comprises a tierod (30, 130) 

connected between the movement means (21) of the bar (21) 
and the first part of the guide means (19, 119). 
Device in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that 
said first part (19) makes up the entire extension of the 

guide means. 
Device in accordance with claim 1 characterised in that 
it comprises a pusher (13, 113) with translation means 

(15, 18) to push a bar axially along the guide means to 
insert the leading end of the bar into the lathe chuck 

(11, 111). 
Device in accordance with claim 9 characterised in 
that the translation means of the pusher (13, 113) 

comprise a powered chain (15) to which is constrained the 
rear end of the pusher.  

 
Device in accordance with claim 9 characterised in 
that the pusher (13, 113) has its leading end bearing a 

clamp (14, 114) for grasping the tail end of the bar. 
Device in accordance with claim 9 characterised in 
that the translation means (15, 18) comprise a hydraulic 

motor (18).
