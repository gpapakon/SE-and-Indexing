<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
management of personalized diets operating 
interactively with the users. More specifically, the present invention relates 
to an apparatus of the type mentioned above, comprising 
electronic weighing scales, an instrument measuring the 
height of the user and interactive operation or 
dialogue means between the apparatus and the user to 
allow input of data in addition to weight and height to 
be supplied to a data processor associated to the 
apparatus in such a way that the former can calculate 
automatically, on the basis of recorded parameters, 
personalized diets for the decrease, maintenance or 
increase of weight for each user. The apparatus indicated above can, furthermore, 
with the support of its basic structure, supply other 
additional services, as will be illustrated in the 
following description. Automatic weighing scales capable of supplying 
other information in addition to the weight of a person 
are known from the state of the art. Programs for more 
or less personalized diets, for use on personal 
computers or the like, are also known. However, no 
apparatus is known that unites these two functions and 
is capable of supplying appropriate information to a 
number of users unconnected, as far as possible, from 
subjective factors and capable of providing corrections 
over a period of time in order to allow the user to 
reach and maintain that which is commonly known as his 
"ideal weight". According to the present invention an apparatus of 
the type mentioned is provided, as generally 
illustrated in the characterizing section of claim 1. The present invention will now be described with  
 
reference to presently preferred embodiments thereof, 
given as non limiting examples, and according to the 
figures of the enclosed drawings, in which: 
figure 1 shows a plan view of the apparatus 
according to the present invention as a whole; figure 2 shows a general block diagram for the 
central processing unit in the apparatus and for the 
peripheral devices related thereto; figure 3 shows a block diagram for a 
microcontroller associated to input and output devices; figure 4 shows a block diagram for a further 
microcontroller associated to the user's weight and 
height sensors. With reference to the drawings, and in particular 
to figure 1, the apparatus according to the present 
invention, indicated as a whole with 1, is made up of a 
base 2 housing the electronics for data control and 
processing, a platform 3 for weighing the user, a
