<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring a movement between two parts (23, 27) is proposed which provides for high resolution of the movement. A first and second radiation (13, 14) are divided into a first measurement radiation (18, 18a) and into a second measurement radiation (19, 19a) which in each case extend in two optical systems (17, 20). The two measurement radiations (18, 19, 18a, 19a) in the two optical systems (17, 20) are directed towards a reference grating (22) which is allocated to a first part (23). The reference grating (22; 22a, 22b) in each case distracts the two measurement radiations (18, 19; 18a, 19a) in such a manner that common loci of impingement (25 26) are produced which are located on a measuring grating (24) which is allocated to the second part (27). The measuring grating (24) again distracts the two measuring radiations (18, 19; 18a, 19a) in each case in the same direction in which an interference takes place. The radiations (29, 30) which have interfered with one another are detected by radiation sensors (31, 32).
