<ABSTRACT>
A patrol or rescue boat that is formed with a catamaran hull 
so as to provide a generally open deck area that extends through 

the rear of the transom for facilitating the transfer of injured 
persons onto the deck area from the body of water. In addition, 

a removable front deck is also provided. The rear deck has a 
pivotal portion so as to facilitate transfer of injured persons 

onto the deck and then to form an enclosure so that heated water 
can be flooded into the deck from the cooling jacket of the 

engine so as to heat an injured person.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rescue watercraft having a hull 
defining a deck and having a transom. The watercraft is designed 
for facilitating rescue at sea. There is a need for a type of watercraft that is particularly 
useful in rescuing individuals at sea. Such a watercraft should be 
constructed in such a way as to permit high speed operation and yet 
be capable of easily moving an injured person from the body of water 
onto the watercraft for treatment and rescue purposes. The 
construction should be such that the individual can be conveniently 
moved from the body of water onto the deck of the watercraft with the 
minimum amount of disturbance to his body to avoid agravating 
injuries. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a 
rescue watercraft which facilitates rescuing individuals at sea, 
specifically by facilitating transportation of an injured person 
from the body of water onto the deck. Preferrably the accommodation 
of the person should also promote immediate emergency treatment 
there. In order to perform said objective, the rescue watercraft according 
to the present invention is designed such that a rear portion of the 
deck is disposed substantially at the water level when the watercraft 
is operating at sea. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention said 
portion of the deck is defined through a deck opening formed at a 
rear portion of the deck. Preferrably, the length of the deck opening is adjusted to 
correspond to at least that of a person lying thereon in a prone 
condition.  According to yet another preferred embodiment of the present 
invention the watercraft is driven by a propulsion device, 
specifically a jet propulsion unit which is disposed along one side 
of the lowered deck opening. Preferrably there is a pair of jet 
propulsion drive units disposed along opposite sides of the rear deck 
opening. According to yet another preferred embodiment of the present 
invention there is a selectively openable drain means, particularly 
drain openings, for draining water from the deck, specifically from 
the lowered rear deck opening. According to yet further preferred embodiments of the rescue 
watercraft according to the present invention means are provided for 
delivering a heated coolant to the deck opening for a heat treatment 
of a person's body accommodated thereon and that the rear portion of 
the deck opening comprises a pivotably supported panel which is 
latchable in different angular positions, particularly between

<CLAIMS>
Rescue watercraft comprising a hull defining a deck (15) 
and having a transom, characterised in that a rear 

portion of the deck (15) is disposed substantially at the 
water level when the watercraft is operating in the 

body of water. 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said rear portion of the deck (15) is defined 

through a deck opening (35). 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the length of the deck opening (35) at least 

corresponds to that of a person laying thereon in a prone 
condition. 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in at least one of the 
preceeding claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a 

propulsion device, specifically a jet propulsion drive 
unit (32), is disposed on at least one side of the deck 

opening (35). 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in at least one of the 
preceeding claims 1 to 4, characterised by selectively 

openable drain means (41) for draining water from the 
deck (15) including the deck opening (35). 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in at least one of the 
preceeding claims 1 to 5, characterised by means for 

delivering a heated coolant to the deck (15) specifically 
to the deck opening (35) for a heat treatment of a 

person's body accommodated on deck (15, 35). 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in at least one of the 
preceeding claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the rear 

portion (35) of the deck (15) comprises a pivotably 
supported panel (36), pivotable between a lowered 

immersed position and raised upwardly facing position, 
the latter forming a dam to retain water in the deck 

opening (35). 
Rescue Watercraft as claimed in at least one of the 
preceeding claims 1 to 7, characterised by hoist means 

(42, 43) extending over the deck opening (35) and adapted 
to draw a person out of the body of water onto the deck 

(15), specifically the deck opening (35). 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in at least one of the 
preceeding claims 1 to 8, characterised in that, said 

hull having a catamaran type configuration comprised of a 
pair of catamaran hulls (13) disposed on opposite sides 

of the deck opening (35). 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in claim 9, characterised in 
that a forward portion of the catamaran hulls (13), 

preferrably filled with a bouyant floatation medium (26), 
defines a recessed area adapted to accommodate a 

removable deck panel (45) which, in turn, is adapted to 
be affixed across the recessed area. 
Rescue watercraft as claimed in claim 10, characterised 
in that, the deck panel (45) is perforated.
