<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detecting bacteria belonging to
the genus Yersiniaintermedia and more specifically provides
nucleic acid probes and kits along with methods for their
use for the specific detection of Yersiniaintermedia.Although reference is made below to nucleic acid probes for
detecting Yersiniaenterocolitica, these are not part of the
present invention and nor are kits or methods using such
probes.The term "Yersiniaenterocolitica" as used herein, refers to
the bacteria classified as such in Bergey's Manual of
Systematic Bacteriology (N.R. Krieg [ed.], 1984, 498-506,
Williams & Wilkins). Detection of Yersiniaenterocolitica
(Y.enterocolitica) is important in various medical and
public health contexts. Yersiniaenterocolitica infection
can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from those
resembling a cold to gastroenterocolitis. Under-cooked or
uncooked meats are frequently a source of human food-borne
infection from these organisms but routine screening is both
time consuming and difficult.Pursuant to a standard laboratory method and a method
recommended by the F.D.A. (FDA/BAM Bacteriological
Analytical Manual, Chapter 11, 6th Edition, 1984, Supplement
9/87', Association of Official Analytical Chemist), the
presence of Yersiniaenterocolitica in environmental or
dairy specimens (e.g., milk) has been traditionally detected
by culturing an appropriately prepared sample on
microbiological media under conditions favorable for growth
of these organisms. The resulting colonies are then
typically examined for morphological and biochemical
characteristics, a process that generally is initiated 48
hours after acquisition of the sample and disadvantageously
takes between 12-17 days to complete. It is one aspect of the present invention to provide probes
which can hybridize to target regions which can be rendered
accessible to the probes under normal assay conditions.Pace and Campbell (1971) Journal of Bacteriology 107:543-547 discuss
the homology of ribosomal ribonucleic acids from diverse bacterial
species and a hybridization method for quantitating such homology
levels. Similarly, Sogin, Sogin, and Woese (1972) Journal of
Molecular Evolution 1:173-lB4 discuss the theoretical and practical
aspects of using primary structural characterization of different
ribosomal RNA molecules for evaluating phylogenetic relationships.Ribosomes are of profound importance to all organisms because they
serve as the only known means of translating genetic information
into cellular proteins, the main structural and catalytic

<CLAIMS>
A nucleic acid probe capable of hybridising under
predetermined stringency conditions to the 455-477 16S

rRNA region of 
Yersinia intermedia
 or to DNA encoding
said region but not to the corresponding 16S rRNA region

of 
Yersinia enterocolitica
 or to DNA encoding said
corresponding 16S rRNA region of 
Yersinia
enterocolitica.
A nucleic acid probe according to claim 1 which is
selected from probe 927, from an RNA equivalent of probe

927, and from a probe which comprises the sequence of
probe 927 or its RNA equivalent but which is a longer

version thereof.
A method for detecting the presence of 
Yersinia
intermedia
 in a sample, comprising:

a) contacting a nucleic acid probe as claimed in
claim 1 or claim 2 with said sample under

conditions that allow said probe to hybridise to
rRNA said 455-477 16S rRNA region of 
Yersinia
intermedia
 or to DNA encoding said region, if
present in said sample, to form hybrid nucleic acid

complexes; and
b) detecting said hybrid complexes as an
indicator of the presence of said 
Yersinia
intermedia
 in said sample.
A method according to claim 3 wherein said probe is
used to hybridise to rRNA. 
A method according to claim 3 or claim 4 wherein
hybridisation is performed under stringent hybridisation

conditions.
A nucleic acid probe according to claim 1 or claim
2, wherein said predetermined stringency conditions are

stringent conditions.
An assay kit for detecting 
Yersinia
intermedia

comprising a nucleic acid probe according to claim 1 or
claim 2, packaged in at least one container, and

instructions for utilising the said nucleic acid
fragment for detecting 
Yersinia
intermedia.
