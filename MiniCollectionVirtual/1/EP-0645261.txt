Device for the manufacture of book blocks formed by 
adhesively bound printed sheets which are displaced in 

stacks (5) of printed sheets gathered one on top of the 
other along a spiral guide wall from the substantially 

horizontal position into a vertical position and pass 
through a conveying channel (6) formed by a supporting 

element (4) projecting substantially at right angles from 
the lower edge of the guide wall and guiding the stack (5) 

along the back fold edges of the printed sheets and by a 
guide rail (7) which is adjustable with respect to the 

stack height, characterised in that a filling element (10) 
which at least approximately reaches or extends partially 

into the conveying channel (6) and can be brought to bear 
against the supporting element (4) is arranged in the 

opening (9) provided between the supporting element (4) and 
the guide rail (7). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
filling element (10) is arranged so that it is preloaded 

relative to the supporting element (4). 
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in 
that the filling element (10) is a brush with bristles (11) 

at least approximately traversing the opening (9) 
substantially perpendicularly to the conveying channel (6). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
bristles (11) of the brush are brought to bear against the 

supporting element (4) in the opening (9). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
bristles (11) are fixed at one end in an adjustable shaft  

 
(12) of the brush.
