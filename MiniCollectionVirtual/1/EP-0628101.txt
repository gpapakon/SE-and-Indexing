<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel methods for fiber 
finishing. In particular, the present invention relates to 
methods of imparting lubricity to fibers. Generally, in the case of many fiber materials, 
finishing compositions are applied to fibers to improve 
their subsequent handling and processing. Fiber finishes, 
in part, enable a fiber producer to manufacture a fiber 
product and in turn enable a purchaser of that product to 
utilize yarn and fabric manufacturing processes to obtain 
an end product. The composition and amount of a particular 
fiber finish applied depend in large measure upon the 
chemical characteristics of a particular fiber, the 
particular stage in the processing of the fiber at which it 
is applied, and the envisioned use of the particular fiber. Such finishes generally provide lubrication, prevent 
static build-up, and afford a slight cohesion between 
adjacent fibers. Many other characteristics, however, are  
 
also desirable. For example, they should be easily applied 
to and removed from fibers and should be useful in 
subsequent treatment of the fibers. Also, they should have 
desirable thermal and chemical stability while not 
adversely affecting the fibers themselves. Such fiber 
finishes should not leave residues on objects they come in 
contact with nor cause toxic fumes or undesirable odors. 
They should provide for rapid wetting of fiber surfaces, be 
water-soluble or emulsifiable or solvent-soluble, and have 
good storage stability. Further, they should not attract 
soil, cause color changes to fibers, interact with 
frictional elements used in texturizing or be corrosive to 
machine parts. Application of such finishes may generally be 
accomplished by contacting a fiber tow or yarn with a 
solution or emulsion comprising at least one lubricant 
having desirable antistatic properties. Additional 
antistatic agents, wetting agents, additives such as 
antioxidants, biocides, anti-corrosion agents, pH control 
agents, as well as emulsifiers are also commonly found in 
such finishes. A suitable fiber finish may also be sprayed 
or applied directly onto fibers or yarn. In the past, fiber finishes were composed of many 
elements in addition to a lubricant with each element 
imparting a desirable characteristic to the fiber finish. 
For example, in addition to the lubricant, antistatic 
agents were often added to increase the ability of the 
fiber to avoid buildup of static electric charge. Also 
emulsifiers were often added to aid in the application to 
the fiber of the
