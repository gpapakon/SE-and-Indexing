<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is tap water temperature regulation, specifically for the maintenance of a determined - also predeterminable - temperature of tap water on the secondary side, which is heated via a heat exchanger from a primary circuit. To improve the regulation accuracy and for the avoidance of increased regulation deviations, a neural network (30; 40) is used, which controls via a manipulated variable the delivery loading of the delivery pump (9) arranged in the primary circuit. The neural network has two neuron planes (40a, 40b), of which one is an input plane (40a) and one an output plane (40b). To the input plane are fed the desired temperature ( theta s) and the difference  DELTA  theta between the desired temperature  theta s and current temperature theta 25 of the water entering into the heat exchanger on the primary side. Each of the neurons is a carrier of a function (Pi,j). Each of these functions determines a loading P via a flow  PHI , which is detected with a measuring transmitter (19) in the primary circuit. A change of the flow thus effects directly, using the predetermined function Pi,j, a change of the primary load of the primary circuit delivery pump (9), in order to bring the temperature ( theta 18) of the tap water on the secondary side as quickly as possible to a predetermined value and also to keep it constant there in the long term - even in the case of sharply changing tap water flow.
