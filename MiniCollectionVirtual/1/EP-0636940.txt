<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive
polymer composition, particularly a photosensitive polymer
composition which affords a photosensitive polymer printing
plate for coating an aqueous varnish (a resin solution
obtaind by dissolving a resin in a solvent containing water
as a main component on the surface of a printed matter
according to a printing method.As known well, with the recent grade-up of printed
matter it has become popular to apply varnish (called
varnishing) to the surface of printed matter after the
ordinary color printing for the purpose of glazing or for
enhancing the resistance to water and to weather of the
printed matter. As a recent tendency, the method of
applying varnish to only part of a pattern (called partial
or spot varnishing) according to a printing method has been
spreading in quick tempo. On the other hand, in point of
characteristics of varnish, a shift is being made rapidly
from the conventional oil varnish using a resin dissolved in
an organic solvent to an aqueous varnish using a resin
dissolved in a solvent water as a main component from a
world-wide standpoint of eliminating environmental pollution 
or protecting the earth environment. Also in other fields
than the field of aqueous varnish coat printing, an aqueous
resin coating is spreading rapidly.In the above uses there usually is employed a
photosensitive rubber printing plate or an alcohol washing-out
photosensitive resin plate. However, the use of a
photosensitive rubber printing plate involves the problem of
using an organic solvent which exerts a bad influence on the
human body and the earth environment in the washing-out
process for plate making. Also in the case of an alcohol
washing-out photosensitive resin plate, there is encountered
a problem of using ethyl alcohol which is highly flammable
in the washing-out process. Such problems are great
obstacles to the popularization of those printing plates.For avoiding the above problems it is desired to
use a water-developable photosensitive polymer plate which
does not require the use of an organic solvent or an
alcoholic solvent in the washing-out process. However, a
water-developed printing plate usually swells by water, so
is not employable in the coating of an aqueous polymer
according to a printing method.JP4-3162A discloses a photosensitive polymer
composition having a sea-and-islands structure. This can
attain improvement in image reproducibility in some extent
but is not satisfactory in fine image reproducibility.The present inventors have
