<ABSTRACT>
Procedure for detecting misfires, in particular misfires in the case of multiple cylinders, by means of combining a plurality of cylinders to form groups of increased misfire probability and by comparing with each other the sums of the misfires, determined during one observation period, of the groups and of the individual cylinders.

<CLAIMS>
Method for detecting combustion misfires in which 
engine roughness values are calculated from fluctuations 

in the speed of the crank shaft and these values are 
compared with threshold values, and in which cylinder 

groups having an increased likelihood of misfiring are 
formed, characterized 


in that, during a period of observation 
the engine roughness value (LU
n
) calculated for each 
cylinder (n) is in each case compared separately with a 

first threshold value (LUS) and with a second threshold 
value (VLUS) reduced in comparison with the first 

threshold value, 
in that a first counting sum (SA
n
) associated with the 
cylinder is formed if this first threshold value (LUS) is 

exceeded, and a second counting sum (SVA
n
) is formed if 
this second threshold value (VLUS) is exceeded, 
and in that, after the period of observation has 
elapsed, if the total sums (GSA, VGSA) of all of the 

first or second counting sums exceed a predeterminable 
total sum limit value (GWSA) 
group sums (GS1, GS2) are formed for each cylinder 
group from the second counting sums (SVA
n
) and 
a multi-cylinder combustion misfire in the group with 
the higher group sum is inferred if the second counting 

sums (SVA
n
) of the individual cylinders in a group are 
approximately of the same size, whereas 
if the second counting sums (SVA
n
) of the individual 
cylinders are different, a single-cylinder combustion 

misfire is inferred in the cylinder which has the highest 
first counting sum (SA
n
) if the total sum (GSA) of the  
 

first counting sums (SA
n
) exceeds a predeterminable total 
sum limit value (GWSA). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a single-cylinder combustion misfire is also 

inferred in the case of the cylinders having first 
counting sums (SA
n
) exceeding a predeterminable sum limit 
value (SG) if the second counting sums (SVA
n
) of the 
individual cylinders are different. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that checking for multi-cylinder combustion misfires is 

no longer carried out and instead only the single 
cylinder which is misfiring is determined if only the 

total sum (GSA) of the first counting sums (SA
n
) exceeds 
the total sum limit value (GWSA). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that checking for single-cylinder combustion misfires is 

no longer carried out and instead checking is only 
carried out for multi-cylinder combustion misfires if 

only the total sum (VGSA) of the second counting sums 
(SVA
n
) exceeds the total sum limit value (GWSA). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the unreduced and the reduced engine roughness 

threshold values (LUS, VLUS) are taken from a performance 
graph as a function of current operating variables of the 

internal combustion engine such as, for example, load and 
speed. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the reduced engine roughness threshold value (VLUS) 

is calculated from the unreduced engine roughness threshold 
value (LUS) by multiplication by a factor (k) 

between 0 and 1. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the case of an internal combustion engine with 

bank injection, the cylinders associated with one injection 
device in each case form one cylinder group. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the case of a double spark ignition coil, the 

cylinders which are supplied with ignition energy by this  
 

ignition coil in each case form one cylinder group.
