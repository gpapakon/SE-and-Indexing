<ABSTRACT>
Various accessories are to be able to be fastened to a ceiling light fixture in a simple and reliable manner, without adjustment and with tools which are as simple as possible. The ceiling light fixture (2) has a cover ring (6) with an edge groove (62). A mounting (10) which has a clamp-like upper part (13) can be suspended in this edge groove. A lower part (14) of the mounting is constructed to have the shape of a shoe and rests against the outside of the cover ring. The mounting parts have centring surfaces (133 respectively 145), which are constructed with mirror-image symmetry and are at a slight angle with respect to each other, and become tensioned against one another during assembly so as to bear against the cover ring in a tolerance-free manner. A spacer block (9) is constructed so as to be placable into the mounting (10) and a clamping element (11) for accommodating an accessory (7) is constructed so as to be placable and secure against rotation. The fastening device is thus self-adjusting. The fastening device can be used, in particular for interior spaces, for luminaires which are attached, for surface-type luminaires and built-in luminaires.

Device for fastening accessories (7) to a ceiling 
light fixture (2) at a predetermined distance, having a 

mounting (10) that is fixed to a holder (6) integrated 
into the ceiling light fixture, having a spacer (9) that 

is fixed on one side in the mounting, and having a 
clamping element (11) that is provided to accommodate the 

accessory (7) and is arranged at the free end of the 
spacer, characterized in that the holder is designed as 

a covering ring (6) of the ceiling light fixture, which 
ring has, at least in part-regions of its upper side 

facing the ceiling, an edge groove (62) and of which ring 
the underside (63) is designed inclined with respect to 

the ceiling, and in that the mounting (10) is of two-part 
design and has an upper part that is designed as a 

bracket (13) engaging around the edge of the covering 
ring, and has a lower part, connected to said upper part, 

that is designed as a shoe (14) resting on the underside 
of the covering ring, the upper side of the shoe having 

a slope of a few degrees of angle (Î±), pointing in the 
direction of the covering ring, with respect to the 

underside of the bracket, with the result that in the 
mounted state the mounting can be braced with its bearing 

surfaces clamping on the covering ring. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the mutually facing surfaces of the bracket (13) and 

of the shoe (14) of the mounting (10) have centring 
surfaces (133 and 145) which are designed as mirror 

images of each other. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in  
 

that the centring surfaces (133 and 145) are designed as 
a V-shaped groove (145) extending in the radial direction 

towards the covering ring (6) or as a roof-shaped projection 
(133). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that a through hole (131 and 141) is provided 

in each of the bracket (13) and the shoe (14) of 
the mounting (10), in that the through hole in the shoe 

is expanded from its underside to form a blind hole (142) 
for the accommodation of the end of the spacer (9) on the 

side of the mounting, said end having a threaded hole, 
and in that a fastening screw (15) is provided which, 

engaging through the through holes, is screwed to the 
spacer. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the spacer (9) is of rod-shaped design 

and has an asymmetrical cross-section, to which 
accommodation holes (e.g. 142) of identical design in the 

shoe (14) or in the clamping element (11, 11') 
correspond, for centring the spacer with respect to the 

mounting (10) or to the clamping element. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the cross-section of the spacer (9) is designed in 

the form of a segment of a circle. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the clamping element (11, 11') has a 

groove-like recess, open in the radial direction of the 
ceiling light fixture (2), between two limbs (112 and 

113) of the clamping element, for the accommodation of a 
flat edge region of the accessory (7), and in that, in 

one of the limbs and axially parallel to a through hole 
(110) for the accommodation of the spacer (9) in the 

clamping element, there is provided a threaded hole (114) 
for the accommodation of a clamping screw with which the 

accessory can be fixed to the clamping element. 
Device according to one of Claims 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the clamping element (11) has a further 

threaded hole (111) extending at right angles to its  
 

through hole (110) accommodating the spacer (9), said 
threaded hole being provided to accommodate a further 

clamping screw for fixing the clamping element to the 
spacer (9).
