<ABSTRACT>
An acetabular prosthesis (8) having an orientable 
socket bearing (13) and a cup (10) for fixation to bone (6) 

is provided. The bearing (13) has a male taper (26) which 
locks into a corresponding female taper (28) formed in the 

cup (10). Two screws (15) are used to seat the bearing 
(13) in the cup (10) and to further secure the taper lock. 

The assembly of the bearing (13) and cup (10) forms a set 
of peripheral apertures (4) through which bone screws (15) 

can pass to further secure the cup (10) to the patient's 
bone (6). One or both of the socket bearing (13) and the 

cup (10) comprises a ceramic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acetabular prostheses
having a socket bearing and a cup wherein the bearing is
retained within the cup by means of a locking taper.
The socket bearing and/or cup comprises a ceramic material,
which will not exhibit substantial flow when used in an
acetabular prosthesis.Acetabular prostheses having metal socket bearings
are known in the art. Early constructions are shown in
US-A-3,820,167, US-A-3,943,576, US-A-4,077,070, US-A-3,848,272,
and US-A-Re 28,895. These prostheses were of
the constrained type wherein the bearing encompassed more
than half of the ball. The bearing consisted of two pieces
which were placed around the ball and secured to the cup by
riveting or screw threads. Because of the difficulty of
assembling the prosthesis in situ, the surgeon was
provided with an assembled joint comprising both the
femoral and acetabular components.WO-A-83/02555 shows a variation of these earlier
constructions wherein the metal bearing could encompass
180° or less of the femoral ball. Attachment between the
bearing and the cup was again by means of a screw thread.
Accordingly, although in situ assembly was not impossible,
it was still generally impractical because of the screw
thread.US-A- 4,678,472, shows two metal bearing
constructions. In the first construction (Figures 9-10 of
US-A-4,678,472), the bearing comprises two pieces which
encompass more than half of the ball and which are held
together around the ball by means of retaining ring 74.
For this construction, in the assembled joint, the bearing
can rotate within the cup to provide a greater range of
motion for the joint. In the second construction (Figures
33-34 of US-A-4,678,472), the bearing again comprises two
parts which in this case are locked in place within the cup 
by wedge 136.Other constructions for acetabular prostheses
employing metal socket bearings are disclosed in US-A-4,969,910.A bearing composed of a ceramic material is
disclosed in US-A-3,894,297. In this case, the bearing is
carried by a plastic casing, with the bearing being held in
the casing by a flexible, circumferential bead, and with
the casing being held in the prosthesis' cup by a
circumferential bead formed just inside of the rim of the
cup.The hereinafter described and illustrated embodiments
of a prosthesis include an improved mechanism for retaining a
socket bearing in an acetabular cup. More particularly,
the improved mechanism 1) essentially eliminates
micro-motion between the bearing and the cup, 2) allows the
bearing to be easily oriented

<CLAIMS>
A prosthesis (8) for use in forming an
implantable ball and socket joint comprising:


(a) a socket bearing (13) comprising:

(i) a cavity (32) for receiving the ball of
the ball and socket joint;
(ii) an external surface at least a portion of
which comprises a male taper (26); and
(iii) a non-threaded slot (22) having an open
end and a closed end (23);
(b) a cup (10) for fixation to bone comprising:

(i) a cavity (30) for receiving the socket
bearing (13), said cavity (30) having a surface at least a

portion of which comprises a female taper (28) for locking
engagement with the male taper (26) of the socket bearing

(13); and
(ii) a threaded-slot (20);

   said male and female tapers (26, 28) comprising a
self-locking taper and said pros
thesis (8) further
comprising means for driving the male taper (26) into the

female taper (28), said means comprising a screw (15) which
is received in an aperture formed by alignment of the non-threaded

slot (22) of at the socket bearing (13) with the threaded
slot (20) of the cup (10);

   wherein either or both of said socket bearing (13)
and cup (10) comprises a ceramic material.
The prosthesis (8) of claim 1 wherein the total
included taper angle of the locking male and female tapers

is between about six degrees and about seventeen degrees.
The prosthesis (8) of claim 2 wherein the total
included taper angle of the locking male and female tapers

is about fourteen degrees.
The prosthesis (8) of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein
the cup (10) includes a second threaded slot (20) and the

bearing (13) includes a non-threaded slot (24) having two 
open ends which can cooperate with the second threaded slot

(20) of the cup (10) to form an aperture which will allow
passage of the body but not the head of a bone screw (52).
The prosthesis (8) of claim 4 wherein the
thread (21) of the second threaded slot (20) prevents

passage of the head of the bone screw (52) through the
aperture.
The prosthesis (8) of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein
the cup (10) includes a plurality of threaded slots (20)

and the non-threaded slot (22) of the bearing (13) can be
aligned with any one of said threaded slots to form an

aperture for the screw (15).
The prosthesis (8) of claim 6 wherein the
bearing (13) includes a second non-threaded slot (24) having two

open ends which can cooperate with a threaded slot (20) of
the cup (10) to form an aperture which will allow passage

of the body but not the head of a bone screw (52).
