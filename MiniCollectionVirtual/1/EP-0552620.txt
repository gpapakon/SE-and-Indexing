<ABSTRACT>
A rubber-rubber bonded composite structure is made 
up of one unvulcanized preform formed from a rubber 

comprising hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, 
either a combination of methacrylic acid and zinc oxide 

or zinc methacrylate, and an organic peroxide and 
another unvulcanized preform formed from a rubber 

composition containing a rubber in common use, both 
preforms having been laminated together into an 

integrally bonded structure by vulcanization. The 
resulting structure exhibits good rubber-to-rubber 

adhesion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to rubber-rubber composite structures
obtained by the unique bonding of preforms formed from specific
rubber compositions.As is generally known, rubber compositions containing hydrogenated
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, methacrylic acid, zinc oxide and an
organic peroxide are colorable in any desired colors and, upon
vulcanization, are not only resistant to heat and to oil, impermeable
to gas and weatherable but also mechanically strong, hard, elastic,
stretchable and low in specific gravity. If it is made possible
to bond by vulcanization an unvulcanized preform formed from such
a rubber composition directly onto a similar preform formed from
a rubber composition containing a rubber in common use, then
a composite structure of rubber-to-rubber bonding will be produced
which is blessed with physical characteristics peculiar to the two
different rubber compositions. The composite structure thus obtained
is expected to be suitable particularly for use as a 
material for belts, hoses, pneumatic tires and the like. For
instance, weight saving has been more and more strict with
respect to pneumatic tires in the automobile industry. This
trend will be coped with by the use of the above rubber-rubber
composite structure if the latter can be employed to partly or
wholly form a bead filler, an inner liner, a tread portion and
the like for the tire.Even regardless of physical properties of the ultimate composite
structure, it is very difficult to bond, with use of a conventional
adhesive for rubber, a preform resulting from a rubber composition
containing hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, methacrylic
acid, zinc oxide and an organic peroxide onto a preform resulting
from a rubber composition containing a general-purpose rubber. An
adhesive of an isocyanate resin or epoxy resin type would make the
resulting bonded layer brittle and hence susceptible to failure
only under appreciable deformation. The first- and last-mentioned
preforms, therefore, are required to be bonded together by
vulcanization or in any other way without reliance on a resin
type adhesive. EP-A-0 431 907 relates to a rubber-covered roll comprising
a metallic core and at least one covering vulcanized
rubber layer. The rubber layer is formed by a rubber
composition comprising an ethylenically-unsaturated
nitrile-conjugated diene type highly-saturated copolymer
rubber and a zinc salt of an ethylenically-unsaturated
carboxylic acid.DE-A-3 918 928 relates to a hardenable rubber composition
