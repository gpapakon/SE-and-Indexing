<ABSTRACT>
Gas cooking device with at least one radiant gas burner placed under a continuous cooking area of heat radiation transparent material, like glass-ceramics, glass, ceramics or a similar material, having a burner chamber and a burner plate (5), especially made of fibrous material, having control equipment (7b) for the gas supply, and also having conventional ignition, safety and temperature-monitoring equipment, having exhaust-gas ducts for carrying off the combustion gases, and also having a device, especially a blower or a fan, by which additional air is brought up to the burner plate (5), the device by which additional air is brought up to the burner plate (5), and the control equipment (7b) for the gas supply being situated in a separated-off space in which an overpressure is maintained, and which is connected to the burner chamber and to the outside via conduits, especially via pipes, which are gastight in the region outside the separated-off space on their peripheral surfaces.

<CLAIMS>
Gas cooking appliance having at least one radiant 
gas burner comprising a burner chamber and a burner plate 

of fibre material arranged under a continuous cooking 
surface made of a material transparent to heat radiation, 

for example glass ceramic, glass, ceramic or a similar 
material, the appliance being provided with regulating 

devices (15) for the supply of gas, with customary 
ignition, safety and temperature monitoring devices, with 

waste gas channels for the discharge of the combustion 
gases, and with a device, in particular a blower, by 

means of which additional air is brought to the burner 
plate, where the device which draws in additional air 

from outside and supplies it to the burner plate, and the 
regulating device for the supply of gas, are located in 

a separate space in which superatmospheric pressure is 
maintained and which is connected to the burner chamber 

and to the outside by means of lines which are gastight 
on their circumferential surfaces in the region outside 

the separate space, in particular via pipes, characterized 
in that the regulating device (15) for the supply of 

gas comprises a valve block (15a), in particular one 
having magnetic control, in which block (15a) are positioned 

interchangable nozzles (15b) having orifice 
diameters of from 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm, in particular 1 mm, 

which can be matched to various types of gas. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the gastight lines (13) have 

various inlet cross-sectional areas, are round, oval or 
rectangular in shape and are provided with grooves or  

 
helices and/or with tapers and constrictions in the 

region through which flow occurs. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the middle of the inlet orifice 

of a line (13) which connects the separate space (9) to 
the burner chamber (6) is in each case arranged opposite 

a nozzle orifice at a variably adjustable distance 
therefrom. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the line (13) is provided in the 

region of the separate space (9) with matchable, in 
particular radially arranged, openings as inlet orifices 

for the air and begins, in particular, immediately at the 
valve block (15a) or in the plane of the nozzle orifice. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the lines (13) serve, over their 

entire length, as mixing pipes for air and gas, with the 
air inflow into the pipes being achieved by means of the 

superatmospheric pressure and the venturi effect occurring 
as a result of the injection of gas. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the inlet cross-sectional area of 

the line (13) for the supply of the gas/air mixture is at 
least 150 mm
2
. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 and 

2, characterized in that the valve block (15a) is 
arranged in the separate space (9) as part of the 

regulating device (15) for the supply of gas in such a 
way that, by means of its nozzles (15b) positioned in the 

valve block (15a) it injects the gas laterally at an 
angle of less than 90Â°C into orifices (20) which are 

provided in the line (13). 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 to 7 
where the device is a blower (14), characterized in that 

the blower (14) additionally cools the wall of the 
housing via an air conduction system (17) installed in 

the outer walls of the cooking appliance. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the gas/air mixture brought to the  

 
burner plate (12) through the lines (13) is conducted in 

such a way that it is preheated by the hot waste gases. 
Gas cooking appliance according to Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the burner plate (5) contains SiC 

fibres.
