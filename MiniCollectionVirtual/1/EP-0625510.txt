<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel N-alkylacridan
carboxyl derivatives which produce light.
This invention further relates to an improved method of
generating light chemically (chemiluminescence) by the
action of a peroxidase enzyme and an oxidant such as
hydrogen peroxide with a group of N-alkylacridan
carboxyl derivatives. The invention also relates to a
method of greatly increasing the amount of
chemiluminescence produced from this process by the use
of enhancers. The invention also relates to the use of
this method to detect the peroxidase enzyme. The
invention also relates to the use of this method to
detect hydrogen peroxide. Further, the invention
relates to the use of the method to detect and
quantitate various biological molecules. For example,
the method may be used to detect haptens, antigens and
antibodies by the technique of immunoassay, proteins by
Western blotting, DNA and RNA by Southern and Northern
blotting and nucleic acids by enzyme-linked nucleic acid
probes. The method may also be used to detect DNA in
DNA sequencing applications. The method may
additionally be used to detect enzymes which generate
hydrogen peroxide such as glucose oxidase, glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, galactose oxidase and the like.The detection and quantitation of biological
molecules has been accomplished historically with
excellent sensitivity by the use of radiolabeled
reporter molecules. Recently numerous non-radioactive
methods have been developed to avoid the hazards and
inconvenience posed by these materials. Methods based 
on enzyme-linked analytes offer the best sensitivity
since the ability to catalytically turn over substrate
to produce a detectable change achieves an
amplification. Substrates which generate color,
fluorescence or chemiluminescence have been developed,
the latter achieving the best sensitivity.Further increases in assay sensitivity will
expand the range of utility of chemiluminescence-based
methods by permitting the detection of analytes present
in smaller quantities or reducing the amount of time
and/or reagents required to perform the assay. A way to
increase the speed and sensitivity of detection in an
enzymatic chemiluminescent assay is through the use of
substrates which generate light with a higher efficiency
or for a greater length of time.Among the enzymes used in enzyme-linked
detection methods such as immunoassays, detection of
oligonucleotides and nucleic acid hybridization
techniques, the most extensively used to date has been
horseradish peroxidase. To take
