<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article having a main body (10) which 
comprises a backsheet (11) formed of a liquid impermeable 

sheet, a topsheet (12) formed of a liquid permeable sheet, an 
absorbent core (13) interposed between the backsheet and the 

topsheet, and leg gathers (4) disposed along leg holes (2). 
Two sets of elastic members (6a, 6b) are in a stretched state 

bonded to a non-woven fabric along the leg holes (2). Each 
set of elastic members (6a, 6b) is not bonded to the 

non-woven fabric in a region which traverses a crotch region 
to extend from one of the leg holes (2) to the other, and is 

cut in the non-bonding region so that the elastic members 
(6a, 6b) snap back toward crossing points where the two sets 

of the elastic members meet to form tails (T).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an absorbent article according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such an absorbent article is known from EP-A-0 437 771 or
EP-A-0 405 575, wherein the article comprises a water-permeable
topsheet, a water-permeable backsheet and a water-absorbent
core therebetween. Elastic members are bonded to the surface
of the backsheet.EP-A-0 510 715 discloses the production of parts for an absorbent
article, wherein elastic members which form a cross-over
portion between leg holes are cut along the cross-over portion
which is bonded to the sheet material. In this way separate
articles are produced from a continuous sheet material. Absorbent articles, particularly infant and adult
diapers have recently gained increased acceptance from
consumers for their advantageous characteristics of stability
during use and reduced leakage.In order for tapeless absorbent articles to fully
exhibit their advantageous characteristics, they need to fit
snugly to a user's body, particularly at leg hole portions
thereof. To this end, such tapeless absorbent articles have
elastically stretchable ruffles or leg gathers, as they are
generally called, along peripheries of the leg holes.One example of such tapeless absorbent articles with leg
gathers is disclosed in Japanese Kokai Patent Hei 3-195558.
Two sets of elastic members are attached along the
peripheries of the leg holes to form leg gathers. Each set
of elastic members extends along one leg hole from a front
end of the leg hole to a midpoint of the leg hole, and
continuously extends transversely of a central region (crotch
region) of the article to a midpoint of the other leg hole to 
form a cross-over portion. From the midpoint of the other
leg hole, each set of elastic members further extends
therealong to a rear end of the other leg hole. Those two
sets of elastic members are arranged so as to define a
somewhat X-shaped configuration.Such arrangement of the elastic members advantageously
facilitates a continuous manufacturing process of the
absorbent articles. Specifically, a liquid impermeable sheet
in a continuous web form is continuously transported in one
direction. Continuous elastic strands are fed onto the sheet
in a sinusoidal configuration for securement thereto. The
resultant combination is cut at a predetermined interval to
form a composite backsheet incorporating the elastic members
secured thereto.The elastic members arranged along peripheries of the
leg holes in the aforementioned, conventional tapeless
absorbent article function to form leg

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article comprising:

a main body (10) having a waist hole (1) and a pair of
leg holes (2), said main body comprising a topsheet (12) for

facing toward a wearer's body, a backsheet (11) disposed
outwardly of the topsheet, and an absorbent core (13)

interposed between the topsheet and the backsheet;
a waist gather (3) disposed along the waist hole (1);
a leg gather (4) disposed along each of the leg holes
(2); two sets of elastic members (6a,6b)

each of said two sets of elastic members (6a, 6b)
extending along a periphery of a first leg hole (2) from a

front end thereof to a midpoint thereof, continuously
extending therefrom transversely to a midpoint of a second

leg hole (1) to form a cross-over portion, and further
extending to a rear end of the second leg hole (2) so that

the two sets of elastic members (6a, 6b) are arranged to
define an X-shaped configuration,

   characterized in that 
said topsheet (12) comprises a dual-layered sheet
material (21, 22), wherein the two sets of elastic members (6a, 6b) are

interposed between the dual sheet material,
said elastic members (6a, 6b) being bonded in a

stretched state to said sheet materials along areas that
extend along the leg holes so as to exclude the crossover

portion from the bonding, said elastic members being cut at
the crossover portion so that they snap back toward cross

portions of said elastic members to define tail portions (T)
extending from the cross portions.
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein

said sheet materials (21, 22) and the elastic members
(6a, 6b) are cut out together in the crossover portion, to 

form an aperture (30) in said topsheet (12).
The absorbent article of claim 1 wherein

said topsheet (12) comprises a non-woven fabric disposed
to face toward the wearer's body, and a synthetic resin film

disposed to face toward the backsheet (11).
A method of manufacturing an absorbent article
according to claim 1,

comprising the steps of:

forming a topsheet (12) by positioning, between two
sheets of material (21, 22) in elongated web forms, a pair of

elastic members (6a, 6b) in overlapping sinusoidal
configurations with an inverted phase relation to each other,

so that they define a plurality of elongated oblong areas
therebetween,
bonding the elastic members (6a, 6b) to the sheet
material (21, 22) in alternate ones of the oblong areas, and
cutting the elastic members (6a, 6b) in the oblong area
to which they are not bonded allowing them to snap back

toward crossing portions thereof;
combining said topsheet (12) with the backsheet (11);
and connecting the absorbent core (13) to the topsheet (12) or

backsheet (11) before or after the topsheet (12) and backsheet
(11) are combined, and
severing the resultant combination along predetermined
cutting lines.
The method of claim 4, wherein 

said sinusoidal configurations have alternate high and
low amplitudes per half cycle, and the elastic members are

bonded to the sheet materials in portions having the high
amplitude.
