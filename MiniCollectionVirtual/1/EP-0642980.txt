<ABSTRACT>
The pallet has a base part 10 which has an outer enclosure 12 and a bearing surface 20 for objects or for an intermediate shelf. Arranged in an upright manner on the enclosure 12 of the base part 10 are at least two base-part posts 22. At least two abutments 24 are arranged at a height h above the bearing surface 20. At least two pivoting posts 32 can be locked on one of the base-part posts 22 in each case so as to be upright in a position of use, are guided out of the position of use on the associated base post 22, can be displaced upwards into an upright intermediate position and from there can be pivoted into a lying rest position, in which case they are supported on the associated abutment 24. The pallet makes it possible to stack objects in at least two layers, separated from one another by an intermediate shelf, and it can be stacked in a space-saving manner when empty.

<CLAIMS>
A pallet for storing and shipping of objects which are
stacked in at least two layers which are separated from each

other by an intermediate bottom, having

a base part (10) comprising an outer border (12) and a
supporting surface (20) for objects or for an intermediate

bottom,
at least two base part posts (22) which are arranged at the
border (12) of the base part (10) in an upright position,

comprising at their upper ends a notch (26) each and below
same an essentially vertical guide (28), and
at least two swivelling posts (32) which are permanently
guided in the guide (28) of one each of the swivelling posts

(22), are lockable in an operating position in an upright
position by engagement with the notch (26) of the associated

base part post (22), are movable from the operating position
upwards into an upright intermediate position, and from there

are pivotable into a lying rest position,

characterised in that
to the base part posts (22) an abutment (24) each is
assigned which is arranged at a height (h) above the

supporting surface (20), with
the height (h) of the abutments (24) being dimensioned in
such a manner that the swivelling posts (32) in their lying

rest position bear against the associated abutment (24), and
the guides (28) beginning below the abutments (24) and extending
upwardly beyond the height (h) of the abutments (24).
The pallet according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the height (h) of the abutments (24)
above the supporting surface (20) is dimensioned in such a

manner that several intermediate bottoms without objects to be
shipped can be stacked on the supporting surface (20) without

exceeding said height (h). 
The pallet according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that the abutments (24) are attached to one
each of the base part posts (22).
The pallet according to any of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the base part (10) has four corners at which one base part
post (22) each is standing,
the base part posts (22) are connected in pairs with each
other by means of a base part crosshead (30) each, and
the associated swivelling posts (32) are connected with each
other by a swivelling post crosshead (34).
