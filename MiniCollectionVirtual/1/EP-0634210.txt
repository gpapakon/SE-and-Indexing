<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing a catalyst used for producing methacrylic
acids through gas phase catalytic oxidation of
methacrolein with molecular oxygen.Many proposals have been made on the methods
and catalysts for producing methacrylic acids through
gas phase catalytic oxidation of methacrolein.
Especially, ever since discovery of the heteropoly-acid
type catalysts, a number of patent applications have
been filed regarding the improvements thereof. For
example, catalysts containing germanium are disclosed
in JP-A-57-45130 and JP-A-62-175435. Germanium dioxide is
added in the whole amount and as a solid to a solution
comprising some of the components constituting the catalyst.The results of the reactions using
the germanium-containing catalysts
disclosed in the above patents are still
unsatisfactory, and further improvements are
required of such catalysts for their industrial use.An object of the present invention is to
provide a method of preparing a novel catalyst which 
enables advantageous production of methacrylic acids
from methacrolein.As a result of strenuous studies for improving
the conventional catalyst preparation techniques, the
present inventors found out a method of preparing a
novel catalyst which enables production of methacrylic
acids in a significantly higher yield than possible with
the catalysts prepared according to the conventional
methods.The present invention consists in a method
of preparing a catalyst
represented by
the formula:

wherein P, Mo, V, Ge and O represent phosphorus,
molybdenum, vanadium, germanium and oxygen, respectively;
X represents at least one element selected from
the group consisting of arsenic, antimony, bismuth,
zirconium, tellurium, silver and boron; Y represents at
least one element selected from the group consisting of
iron, copper, zinc, chromium, magnesium, tantalum,
manganese, barium, gallium, cerium and lanthanum; Z
represents at least one element selected from the group
consisting of potassium, rubidium, cesium and thallium;
and a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h represent the atomic
ratios of the respective components, and when b = 12, 
then a = 0.5-3, c = 0.01-3, d = 0.01-3, e = 0-3,
f = 0-3, g = 0.01-3, and h is the number of oxygen atoms
required for satisfying the above atomic ratios of the
respective components, wherein germanium dioxide is used as
the Ge material. According to the present invention, an
aqueous solution of a hydroxide of an element represented by Z
in the above formula is used, wherein
