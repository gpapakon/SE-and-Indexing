<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for identifying and sorting aluminium and plastic screw caps of bottles (14) and similar containers after the unscrewing process, using a rotating unscrewing machine (10) having screwing-on heads (6) which describe a circular or curved path, engage around the screw caps (13) mounted on the bottles or containers and, with simultaneous rotation, screw them off, lift them up and discharge them by, among other means, arranging for an ejection rod (11), which can be actuated by means of a radial cam (1), directly or indirectly to open the gripping device (5) of the unscrewing heads for the caps and for the latter to be released above a collecting container, by arranging for expansion of the gripping device (5) of the unscrewing heads (6) to be carried out after some delay and in stages via at least two steps in the radial cam, in such a way that in an initial phase, when the first stage of the radial cam has been reached, the aluminium screw caps of a relatively small diameter and in a second phase after further operation of the radial cam and when the second step has been reached, the plastic screw caps of a relatively large diameter are ejected into separate containers at a distance from one another corresponding to the distance between the steps. In this process, the device according to the invention has a radial cam which activates the stroke of the unscrewing heads and has at least two steps in the ejection sector, the inclination, height, length and distance between the said steps being proportional to the opening distance of the gripping device of the unscrewing heads and the distance between the at least two collecting containers.

Process of identifying and sorting of aluminum and 
plastic screw caps as used on bottles and other 

containers after their removal from the bottles or 
other containers using, for the removal, a rotating 

twist-off machine equipped with twist-off heads 
passing through a circular or trajectory course, 

with the screw caps applied to the bottles or containers 
being clutched by these twist-off heads, 

unscrewed in a rotating movement, lifted off, then 
ejected by means - among others - of an ejector 

tappet which, activated by a cam, directly or indirectly 
drives open the gripping device of the 

twist-off heads thus releasing the screw caps and 
dropping them into a collecting receptacle,
wherein
 
the gripping device of the twist-off heads is driven 

open, in a time-delayed and stepwise motion, by 
at least two stages of the cam in such a way as to 

enable, 

a) in a first phase, upon arriving at the first 
stage of the cam, the aluminum screw caps having 

a smaller diameter, and 
b) in a second phase, as the cam proceeds in its 
course and upon arriving at the second stage, 

the plastic screw caps having a larger diameter, 
c) to be released and dropped into separate collecting 
receptacles placed at a distance from 

each other that corresponds to the gap between 
the two stages of the cam. 
Device for the execution of the process described 
in Claim 1 equipped with a bottle conveying line 

and centering devices used to accurately place the 
bottles (14) in an ideal seizing and clutching position 

below the claw-shaped twist-off heads (6), 
with the twist-off heads being distributed in a 

concentric arrangement around a vertical central 
axis (12) enabling them to pass through a circular 

or trajectory course that represents the field of 
action, and with the twist-off heads (6) moving up 

and down, the up-and-down stroke being controlled 
by a cam, the screw caps being twisted off the 

bottle (14) by a rotational movement of the twist-off 
heads to be subsequently discharged into a receptacle,
wherein
 
the cam (1) that controls the stroke of the twist-off 

heads (6) presents, in the ejection or discharge 
sector (2), at least two stages (3,4) the pitch, 

height and length of which, as well as the spacing 
one from another, are proportional both to the drive-open 

motion of the gripping device (5) of the 
twist-off heads (6) and to the distance at which at 

least two collecting receptacles (7,8) are placed 
from each other.
