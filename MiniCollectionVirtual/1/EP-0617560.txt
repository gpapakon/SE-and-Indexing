<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an adapter (FIG. 3) which permits transmission of red, 
green and blue video signals over separate unshielded twisted wire pairs (not shown, 

but connected to terminals 7,8; 6,3; 2,1). Crosstalk is minimized by wideband video 
chokes (T₁-T₃) coupled to each signal input/output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for applying separate color components
of a video baseband signal onto separate twisted pairs of wires.There is a present and future need to bring video signals to the desk in
office environments. Rather than install new wiring or optical fiber cables, it is
desirable to transmit the video signals over twisted wire pair cables which already
exist in the structure and are presently used for telephone transmission, as in
AT&T's Systimax® Premises Distribution System.In applications where high resolution is required, for example, in
transmitting stock quotations, it is usually necessary to transmit red, green and blue
components of the video signal over separate wire pairs. However, crosstalk can be
a significant problem. Further, common mode signals induced on the cable can
create unacceptably high radiation emissions.Recent proposals have suggested transmitting composite video signals
over a twisted wire pair using active components to compensate for phase delays.
(See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,130,793 and U.S. Patent No. 5,172,413). However, it
should be more economical to couple video signals in a "passive" rather than an
"active" manner.Transmission of red, green, and blue signals on separate twisted wire
pairs has also been suggested. (See Amulet Electronics Product Literature for RGB
Video Balun). However, it does not appear that the problems of crosstalk and
common mode signal suppression have been previously addressed.1986 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER

discloses a baseband coupler used as part of a hybrid coax and twisted pair Home
Bus system comprising four coaxial cables and four twisted pairs where various
appliances are connected either to the coaxial cables or twisted pairs via Interface
Units. The baseband coupler is used to couple the digital control data signal (0-12
MHz) carrying twisted pairs to the coaxial cables which carry broadband video
signals (18 MHz-75 MHz; 76 MHz-770 MHz). A Home Bus Controller (HBC),
which has a transmitter and receiver circuit for receiving and transmitting the control
data, is used with the baseband coupler. The coupler is a pulse transformer with a
primary winding, a secondary winding and a tertiary winding. The primary winding
is connected to the transmitter/receiver circuit of the HBC. The secondary winding
is connected to a low pass filter which is then connected to the
