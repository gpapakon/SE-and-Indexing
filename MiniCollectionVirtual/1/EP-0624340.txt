<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable
antibacterial filter particularly applicable to lines for
connection to spirometric devices.As it is known, spirometric devices are frequently used
in respiratory physiopathology and bronchopneumology wards
and in sports medicine centers.The spirometric technique is used to determine the
volume of the inspired air or to study the composition of
the expired air in order to ascertain the functionality of
the lungs and of the basal metabolism.The patient undergoing a spirometric test must breathe
into the spirometer through a plastic hose which is provided
with a mouth-nose mask or with a mouthpiece that allows to
convey the air to the device.Since most of the patients undergoing this test may be
affected by respiratory disorders, there is the problem that
the viral and bacterial loads present in the air expired by
a patient during the spirometric test are carried through
the hose to the device, which is thereby contaminated.The bacterial contamination of the spirometer and of
the hose may therefore be transmitted to the patients that
are subsequently subjected to the same test.In order to prevent any possibility of contamination of
the device and of the hose as well as any cross-contamination,
antibacterial filters interposed between the
hose and the mask or mouthpiece have already been used.The filter must have an extremely low flow resistance
to avoid altering the respiratory parameters recorded during 
the spirometric test and must also have a good bacterial
retention ability.The filters currently in use comprise a box-like
container inside which there is an antibacterial filtration
membrane which is pleated and arranged in a pack-like
configuration. Such a filter is known for example from U.S.
Patent No. 4,798,676 which discloses a filter comprising a
housing having an inlet, an outlet, and a filter medium
disposed therebetween.First of all, with this arrangement the filtration
surface is considerably limited, so that antibacterial
effectiveness may be severely compromised.Another drawback resides in the fact that these kinds
of filters have a very high cost and their disposable use is
consequently particularly expensive.Furthermore it is necessary to replace, beyond the
filter body, the mouthpiece or mask which is in contact with
the user.The principal aim of the present invention is to solve
the problems described above by providing an antibacterial
filter that is designed specifically for spirometric devices
and allows to offer a very large actual
