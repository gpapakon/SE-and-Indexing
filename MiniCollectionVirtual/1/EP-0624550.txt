<ABSTRACT>
Heat transfer solids are formed, suitably from particulate 
refractory inorganic solids, notably alumina, which contains as 

impurities up to about 0.5 wt% silicon and/or up to about 500 wppm 
boron, by treating with an acid, or dilute acid solution sufficient to 

reduce the concentration of silicon and boron in the outer peripheral 
surface layer of the particles to no greater than about 5 atom % 

silicon and boron. High surface purity particles with reduced 
sintering and agglomeration characteristics are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of a 
particulate heat transfer solid, and to a process utilizing a 
combination of said heat transfer solid in admixture with a catalyst, 
or catalysts, to provide a fluidizable contact mass useful for 
conducting synthesis gas generation. In particular, it relates to the 
production of high surface purity refractory inorganic oxides, notably 
alumina, and their use as heat transfer solids for conducting high 
temperature fluidized bed synthesis gas operations. Particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids, e.g., alumina, 
have been employed for many years as catalyst supports, or carriers, 
in natural or synthetic form. WO-A-85 00799 discloses the preparation of high purity 
alumina suitable for use particularly in the ceramics industry, but 
also as a catalyst support. The starting material is a solid hydrated 
alumina containing significant impurity content, especially of Na2O. 
The hydrated alumina is reacted with concentrated hydrochloric acid to 
convert at least a portion to solid aluminum chloride hexahydrates. 
The solid from the reaction is recovered and calcined to form an 
anhydrous amorphous or crystalline alumina with a lower impurity 
content, especially Na2O, than the starting material. In the production of synthesis gas, or syn gas (hydrogen and 
carbon monoxide), low molecular weight hydrocarbons, primarily 
methane, are reacted in the presence of steam (steam reforming 
process) or oxygen (partial oxidation process), or both steam and 
oxygen, at high temperature within a fluidized bed of catalyst, e.g., 
nickel on an alpha alumina support. Frequently, a second 
catalytically active solid is present in minor amount to promote the 
steam reforming reaction. Suitably, particulate refractory inorganic 
oxide solids, notably alpha alumina solids, are admixed with the 
catalyst, or catalysts, of the fluidized bed as heat transfer solids  
 
to control the temperature of reaction. Processes utilizing the 
admixtures of catalysts and heat transfer solids in reacting low 
molecular weight hydrocarbons in the presence of both steam and 
oxygen, it has been found, have provided overall high thermal 
efficiencies in the production of syn gas. Certain particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids as heat 
transfer materials are more resistant than others to melting and 
agglomeration at the severe high temperature oxidizing and reducing 
conditions encountered in fluidized bed syn gas generation processes.
