<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cable sheath (jacket) cutter which allows cutting, both longitudinally (parallel to a generator) (Fig. 2) and circumferentially (Fig. 3), on plastic casings (1a) of electrical or telephone cables (1) with different diameters. The blade holder (3) is pulled forward (3a, 3b) by moving (7a) a toothed (7b) driving lever (7) which is connected in articulated fashion (5, 6) via links (4) to the blade holder (3). The blade holder (3) has, on the blade side, a region designed as a support for the cable, which region is defined by projections (3e) and two support lines (3c, 3d) which run at right angles to each other.

Cable sheath cutter having a blade holder (3) 
and, mounted by its swivel pin (6) thereon so as 

to swivel in the cutting plane in which both the 
cutting edge of the blade (2) and the cutting 

directions (3a, 3b) lie, a driving lever (7) which 
has a curved serration (7b), characterised in that 

the driving lever (7) is arranged with its swivel 
pin (6) spaced from the blade holder (3), and that 

the swivel pin (6) of the driving lever (7) is 
pivotably coupled, by way of at least one link-plate 

(4) pivotable in the cutting plane or 
parallel thereto, to a pin (5) provided on the 

blade holder (3). 
Cable sheath cutter according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the swivel pin (6) of the 

driving lever (7) is coupled to the blade holder 
(3) by way of two link-plates (4), each of which 

is arranged laterally on the blade holder (3) and 
on the driving lever (7). 
Cable sheath cutter according to one of claims 
1 and 2, characterised in that the cons
truction of 
the region of the blade holder (3) that engages 

the covering (la) of the cable (1) is determined 
by the course of two bearing lines (3d, 3c), which 

correspond to the two cutting directions along the 
surface line (3a) and along the circumferential 

line (3b) and which intersect at an angle of 90Â°,  
 

the cutting edge of the blade being arranged in 
the region of that intersection point. 
Cable sheath cutter according to one of claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that to guide the blade 

holder (3) on the covering (la) of the cable (1) 
during cutting, be it along the surface line (3a) 

or along the circumferential line (3b), the 
sheath-engaging region of the blade holder (3) in 

the direction of the bearing lines (3d), (3c) each 
time is in the form of two grooves intersecting at 

right angles or rather in the form of four 
projections (3e) created by the grooves and 

arranged symmetrically with respect to the bearing 
lines (3d, 3c). 
Cable sheath cutter according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the sheath-engaging region 

of the blade holder (3) is in the form of an 
element that is separate from the blade holder (3) 

yet is attachable thereto and rotatable about an 
axis of rotation containing the cutting edge of 

the blade (2), the sheath-engaging region of that 
element comprising one groove or two or more than 

two grooves of different shape, or projections.
