<ABSTRACT>
A rolling mill material handling system includes a 
cooling bed (20) and an associated laying head and cooling 

conveyor (38). Hot rolled products may be cut into 
segments which are shifted laterally onto the cooling bed. 

Alternatively, the hot rolled products may be directed 
longitudinally in undivided lengths past the cooling bed 

to the laying head (32) where they are formed into rings 

and deposited on the cooling conveyor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to continuous hot 
rolling mills of the type which produce so called "long 
products" (e.g. rods, bars and the like), and is concerned 
in particular with an improved system for handling such 
products as they emerge from the mill. In a typical conventional mill installation where for 
example billets are being rolled continuously into round 
bars, the finished product is usually subdivided into 
shorter segments as it emerges from the mill. These 
product segments are then brought to rest and shifted 
laterally onto the receiving end of a cooling bed. The 
product segments undergo cooling as they progress 
laterally across the cooling bed. Upon arriving at the 
delivery end of the bed, the coiled product segments are 
further subdivided into shorter customer lengths prior to 
being bundled. Problems are often encountered in the shearing and/or 
bundling of the product segments leaving the delivery end 
of the cooling bed, causing the cooling bed to become 
rapidly filled. This in turn necessitates a shut down of 
the entire mill. A primary objective of the present invention is to 
provide an improved material handling system which 
includes an overflow outlet for the cooling bed in the  
 
event that shearing and bundling problems are encountered. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the 
material handling system includes a shear positioned along 
the delivery path leading from the mill. The shear is 
operable selectively in either a first mode in which it 
subdivides the finished product into segments, or a second 
mode permitting the product to continue along the delivery 
path in an undivided state. A cooling bed is positioned along the delivery path 
downstream from the shear. A run on table is operable 
selectively in either a first mode transferring product 
segments received from the shear onto the cooling bed, or 
a second mode allowing individual product to continue 
along the delivery path past the cooling bed. A laying head is positioned along the delivery path 
downstream from the cooling bed. The laying head forms 
undivided product bypassing the cooling bed into rings 
which are deposited on a cooling conveyor in the form of 
overlapping non-concentric rings. The rings are cooled on 
the conveyor before they are gathered into coils at a 
reforming station at the delivery end of the conveyor. Preferably, driven pinch roll units are strategically 
positioned along the rolling line to achieve braking 
and/or to ensure unimpeded progress of the product
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A material handling system for hot rolled long products emerging 
longitudinally along a delivery path (12) from a continuous hot rolling mill (10), 

said system having shear means (14) along said delivery path, said shear means 
being operable selectively between a first mode subdividing said product into 

segments and a second mode permitting said product to continue along said path 
in an undivided state, a cooling bed (20) positioned alongside said path at a 

location following said shear means, and transfer means (22) operable selectively 
between a first mode transferring product segments received from said shear 

onto said cooling bed, and a second mode permitting longer undivided product 
lengths to continue along said delivery path past said cooling bed, wherein a 

laying bead (32) is positioned along said path at a location following said transfer 
means, said laying head being operative to form said undivided product lengths 

into a continuous series of rings (36), a conveyor (38) is arranged to receive said 
rings from said laying head and for transporting said rings to a reforming station 

(40), and means (42) are provided at said reforming station for gathering said 
rings into coils.  

 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by decelerating means (24,26) positioned 

between said shear means and said transfer means for 

slowing said product segments. 
The material handling system of claim 2 further 
characterized by said decelerating means comprising at 

least one pinch roll unit (24). 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by means (34) for propelling products into 

said laying head. 
The material handling system of claim 4 further 
characterized in that said means for propelling comprises 

a pinch roll unit. 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by switch means operating in conjunction 

with said shear means to direct successive product 
segments alternatively along said delivery path and an 

adjacent path parallel thereto. 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by said cooling bed having a receiving end 

underlying said delivery path and a delivery end remotely 
disposed laterally therefrom, and wherein said transfer 

means is operable to deposit said product segments onto 
said receiving end.  

 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by means associated with said conveyor for 

coiling the rings being transported to said reforming 
station. 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by means (16) arranged along said delivery 

path for cooling said product in advance of said shear 
means. 
The material handling system of claim 9 further 
characterized by means (18) interposed between said 

cooling means and said shear means for propelling said 
product along said delivery path. 
The material handling system of claim 10 further 
characterized in that said propelling means comprises a 

pinch roll unit. 
The material handling system of claim 1 further 
characterized by rolling means (48) between said transfer 

means and said laying head for further reducing the cross 
sectional area of said product. 
A process 
of operating a material handling system according to claim 1, 

for handling a hot rolled long product 
emerging continuously from a hot rolling mill (10) wherein 

the product is divided into segments by a shear means (14) 
and deposited onto a cooling bed (20), characterised by 

inactivating said shear means and directing the undivided 
product along a delivery path to alternative cooling means 

(38) in the event that the cooling bed (20) becomes  
 

overloaded or malfunctions. 
A process as claimed in claim 13 wherein said 
undivided product is cut into segments prior to deposition 

onto said alternative cooling means.
