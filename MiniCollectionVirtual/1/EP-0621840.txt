<ABSTRACT>
A rear wheel suspension for a bicycle includes paired lower arm members (2, 102) pivotally connected to the bicycle frame seat tube (14) such that they can pivot about an axis (20) situated above the center of the bottom bracket, paired upper arm members (3, 103) adapted to receive the rear wheel axle (24) at hub points located on an axis situated above their lower ends and pivotally connected to the respective lower arm members such that they can pivot about an axis (4) near the rear ends of the lower arm members, and a device (5 or 10) associated with the upper ends of the upper arm members and pivotally connected to an upper pivot point (6) on the seat tube for limiting the path and the extent of movement of the upper ends of the upper arm members.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REAR SUSPENSION FOR BICYCLESBackground of the Inventioni. Technical Field This invention relates to rear wheel suspensions for bicycles.ii. Background ArtConventionally, a bicycle is provided with a frame that is rigid or is flexible only to the extent that particular frame members are flexible. A conventional frame is made of welded generally tubular members, including a generally upright seat tube that supports the seat at its upper end and abuts the bottom bracket, in which the crank rotates, at its lower end; a generally horizontal top tube that is welded at its rear end near the top of the seat tube and at its front end to a head tube, in which the front fork, constituting the front wheel suspension, rotates for steering; a down tube that is welded at its upper front end to the head tube and at its lower rear end to the bottom bracket; and a rear wheel suspension. The seat tube, top tube, and down tube form the rigid generally triangular configuration of the main frame, with the bottom bracket carried at the lower apex. A conventional rigid rear 

 suspension is made up of a pair of generally horizontal chain stays that are welded at their front ends to the bottom bracket and are adapted to receive the rear wheel axle near their rear ends; and a pair of seat stays that are welded at their upper ends near the top of the seat tube and are welded near the ends of the chain stay arms at their lower ends. The seat tube, chain stays, and seat stays form a rigid generally triangular configuration, with the rear wheel carried at the rear apex. Such a conventional rigid arrangement can be suitable for road or track use, where the riding surface is generally free of irregularities, but is unsatisfactory for comfort and optimum performance off-road. As cyclists have demanded higher performance in off-road bicycles, variously referred to as "mountain bikes", "trail bikes", or "cross-country bikes", bicycle makers have recognized the desirability of providing a pivoting spring suspension for at least the rear wheel.Pivoting "swingar " spring suspensions have long been used for rear wheel suspension on motorcycles. In a simplest configuration, the chain stays are replaced by a pair of arms that are pivotally attached at their front ends to the frame at a pivot point near the bottom bracket. The rear ends of the swing arms, carrying the rear wheel, move upward and downward in arcs parallel to the plane described by the rear wheel and centered on the swing arm pivot axis. The range of movement of the swing arms

Claims
1. A rear wheel suspension for a bicycle having a seat tube with a bottom bracket embracing a crank axis, comprising paired right and left lower arm members each having a front and a rear end, said front ends of said lower arm members being pivotally connectable to the seat tube such that said lower arm members are pivotable about a lower arm pivot axis situated above the horizon of the bottom bracket crank axis; paired right and left upper arm members each having an upper and a lower end, said lower ends of said upper arm members being pivotally connectable to the respective said lower arm members such that said upper and lower arm members are pivotable about a rear pivot axis near said rear ends of said lower arm members, said upper arm members being adapted to receive a rear wheel axle at hub points located on a hub axis situated above the horizon of said rear pivot axis; and means, associated with said upper ends of said upper arms and pivotally connectable to an upper pivot point on the seat tube, for limiting the path of movement of, and for resiliently limiting the extent of movement of, said upper ends of said upper arms.
2. The rear wheel suspension of claim 1 wherein said lower arm pivot axis is situated at a point that is both above the crank axis horizon and at or below the horizon of the tangent point of the tension run of a drive chain with a chainwheel.
3. The rear wheel suspension of claim 2 wherein said chainwheel is a smaller one of two or more chainwheels of various diameters. 


 4. The rear wheel suspension of claim 2 wherein said chainwheel is a midsize one of three or more chainwheels of various diameters.
5. The rear wheel suspension of claim 1 wherein said hub axis is situated rearward from a vertical line passing through said rear pivot axis.
6. The rear wheel suspension of claim 1 wherein said means for limiting the path and the extent of movement of the upper arm members comprises a telescopic shock absorber pivotally connectable to the seat tube and rigidly connected to said upper ends of said upper arm members.
7. The rear wheel suspension of claim 1 wherein said means for limiting the path of movement of said upper end of said upper arm members includes a lever pivotally connectable at a first end to the seat tube and pivotally connected at a second end to said upper ends of said upper arm members.
8. The rear wheel suspension of claim 7 wherein said lever comprises an A-arm.
9. The rear wheel suspension of claim 7 wherein said means for limiting the extent of movement of said upper end of said upper arm member includes a shock absorber operably connectable between said lever and the seat tube.
10. The rear wheel suspension of claim 9 wherein said lever comprises an A-arm.
11. The rear wheel suspension of claim 9 wherein said shock absorber comprises a spring.
12. The rear wheel suspension of claim 9 wherein said shock absorber comprises an elastomer.
13. The rear wheel suspension of claim 9 wherein said shock absorber comprises a spring and elastomer in combination.
14. The rear wheel suspension of claim 9 wherein said shock absorber comprises a hydraulic shock absorber. 


 15. The rear wheel suspension of claim 9 wherein said shock absorber comprises a spring and hydraulic shock absorber in combination.
16. A bicycle frame having a rear suspension according to claim 1.
17. The bicycle frame of claim 16, further comprising a rear chain derailleur affixed to at least one of said upper arm members.
18. The bicycle frame of claim 16, further comprising a caliper brakemount affixed to at least one of said upper arm members.
19. A bicycle having a rear suspension according to claim 1.
20. A bicycle having a frame according to claim 17 or 18.
