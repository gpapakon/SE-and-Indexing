<ABSTRACT>
Method of correcting a message to be transmitted between a sending apparatus and a receiving apparatus distributed on a transmission line powered by the mains, the said line being the seat of interference affecting the transmission of the said message. According to the invention, the said method of correction includes the following steps:   a) sending by the sending apparatus, at a first transmission speed (V1), of the message with a request for acknowledgement, b) in the absence of acknowledgement, sending by the sending apparatus, at another transmission speed, of a correction message synchronous with the frequency of the mains, with a request for acknowledgement, and containing a correction algorithm, then, the correction algorithm being equal to the identity algorithm, c) in the presence of an acknowledgement of the correction message, sending by the sending apparatus, at the said other speed, of the message with request for acknowledgement, d) in the absence of an acknowledgement of the correction message, sending by the sending apparatus, with yet another transmission configuration, of the message with request for acknowledgement.

Process for correcting a message (M) to be transmitted 
between a sending apparatus (AE) and a receiving apparatus 

(AR) spaced out on a data transmission line (CP) of a mainspowered 
installation, the said line being the origin of 

perturbations liable to affect the transmission of the said 
message, and each apparatus (AE, AR) being able to send and 

receive data at at least two transmission speeds (V1, V2), the 
said correction process including the following steps: 


a) the sending by the sending apparatus (AE), at a first 
transmission speed (V1), of the message (M) to be transmitted 

with a request for acknowledgement (ACK) from the receiving 
apparatus (AR), 
b) in the absence of an acknowledgement (ACK) because of the 
said perturbations, the sending by the sending apparatus (AE), 

at another transmission speed (V2), of a correction message 
(MC) synchronous with the mains frequency, with a request for 

obligatory acknowledgement (ACK') from the receiving apparatus 
(AR), and containing data and a correction algorithm (AC) 

prepared by the sending apparatus (AE) by comparison between 
the bits sent and the bits actually transmitted over the line 

(CP), and then, the correction algorithm (AC) being equal to 
the identity algorithm, 
c) when there is an acknowledgement (ACK') of the correction 
message (MC), the sending by the sending apparatus (AE), at 

the said other transmission speed (V2), of the message (M) to 
be transmitted with a request for acknowledgement (ACK) from 

the receiving apparatus (AR), 
d) in the absence of an acknowledgement (ACK') of the 
correction message (MC), the sending by the sending apparatus 

(AE), at yet another transmission configuration (V3; G), of  
 

the message (M) to be transmitted with a request for 
acknowledgement (ACK) from the receiving apparatus (AR). 
Process of correcting a message (M) to be transmitted

(AR) spaced out on a data transmission line (CP) of a mainspowered

(MC) synchronous with the mains frequency, with a request for 

obligatory acknowledgement (ACK') from the receiving apparatus 
(AR), and containing data and a correction algorithm (AC) 

prepared by the sending apparatus (AE) by comparison between 
the bits sent and the bits actually transmitted over the line 

(CP), and then, the correction algorithm (AC) being different 
from the identity algorithm, 
c) when there is an acknowledgement (ACK') of the correction 
message (MC), the sending by the sending apparatus (AE), at 

the said other transmission speed (V2), of the message (M) to 
be transmitted, synchronous with the mains frequency, with a 

request for acknowledgement (ACK) from the receiving apparatus 
(AR), 
d) in the absence of acknowledgement (ACK') of the correction 
message (MC), the resending by the sending apparatus, at yet  

 
another transmission speed (V3), of a correction message 

synchronous with the mains frequency, with a request for 
obligatory acknowledgement from the receiving apparatus (AR), 

and containing other data and another correction algorithm 
prepared by the sending apparatus (AE) by comparison between 

the bits send and the bits actually transmitted over the line 
(CP), and then, if the said other correction algorithm is 

different from the identity algorithm, resumption of the 
process after step b), or, if the said other correction 

algorithm is equal to the identity algorithm, resumption of 
the process after step b) of the process according to Claim 1. 
Correction process according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that, in the event of any doubt with regard to at least one 

received bit of the message (M) to be transmitted, the 
receiving apparatus (AR) effects a correction operation using 

the correction algorithm (AC) of the correction message 
previously received and acknowledged. 
Correction process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the said step d) is repeated until the 

acknowledgement (ACK) requested has been received by the 
sending apparatus (AE) or until a repetition counter is 

exhausted.
