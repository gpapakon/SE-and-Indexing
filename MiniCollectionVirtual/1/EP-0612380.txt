<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic annular slave cylinder (16) for a motor vehicle clutch having an annular body (21) with inner and outer cylindrical sidewalls (22, 23) having a fluid chamber (55) formed therebetween. The inner sidewalll (22) extends axially beyond the outer sidewall (23) and a piston member (41) is sealingly slideable on the radially outer surfaces of the two walls (22, 23). A clutch release bearing (60) is mounted concentrically of the piston member (41) and fluid chamber (55).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clutch release apparatus for use 
with motor vehicle clutch actuation systems. Motor vehicle transmissions frequently comprise a clutch and 
a gear box whose input shaft is driven through the clutch so 
that the drive of the gearbox can be broken by operation of a 
hydraulically operable slave cylinder. It has become more 
common for the slave cylinder to be an annular slave cylinder 
arranged concentrically of the gear box input shaft as shown, 
for example, in GB-A-2245329. The concentric slave cylinder is frequently fixed to a face 
of the gearbox housing within the confines of the gearbox 
bell housing. Due to dimensional limitations it is becoming 
necessary for the concentric slave cylinder to become more 
compact and to be able to compensate for clutch wear. Accordingly there is provided a hydraulic annular slave 
cylinder for a motor vehicle clutch comprising an annular 
body having inner and outer cylindrical walls forming a first 
hydraulic chamber therebetween, a piston member displaceable 
in response to hydraulic pressure within the chamber, and a 
release bearing operatively connected with the piston member, 
the slave cylinder being characterised in that the piston  
 
member includes a secondary piston mounted on a primary 
piston and displaceable therewith, the secondary piston 
forming with the primary piston a second hydraulic chamber of 
variable length and volume and being connected to the first 
hydraulic chamber through a valve means so that the length of 
the secondary chamber and hence the position of the secondary 
piston and release bearing relative to the primary piston can 
be adjusted to compensate for clutch wear. Such an annular slave cylinder is able to compensate for 
clutch wear. Preferably the release bearing is mounted on the secondary 
piston concentrically of the second fluid chamber. This 
provides a particularly axially compact arrangement. The valve means is preferably arranged to be opened with the 
primary piston when in a fully retracted condition, and to be 
closed when the primary piston is held in an "at-rest" 
condition away form the retracted condition allowing the 
secondary piston to retract relative to the primary piston 
when the valve means is open to compensate for clutch wear. The invention will be described by way of example and with 
reference to following drawings in which:-  
 Fig 1 is a schematic drawing showing a gearbox and clutch 
assembly for a transmission. Fig 2 is a longitudinal cross section through a slave

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic annular slave cylinder (216) for a motor 
vehicle clutch comprising an annular body (221) having 

inner (222) and outer (223) cylindrical walls forming a 
first hydraulic chamber (260) therebetween, a piston 

member (241,270) displaceable in response to hydraulic 
pressure within the chamber, and a release bearing (60) 

operatively connected with the piston member, the slave 

cylinder being characterised in that the piston member 
(241,270) includes a secondary piston (270) mounted on a 

primary piston (241) and displaceable therewith, the 
secondary piston forming with the primary piston a 

second hydraulic chamber (280) of variable length and 
volume and being connected to the first hydraulic 

chamber (260) through a valve means (282) so that the 
length of the secondary chamber and hence the position 

of the secondary piston (270) and release bearing (60) 
relative to the primary piston (241) can be adjusted to 

compensate for clutch wear. 
An annular slave cylinder as claimed in Claim 1 
characterised in that the primary piston (241) includes 

a radially outer cylindrical side wall (244) which is 
slideably supported on the radially outer surface of the 

outer cylindrical wall (223), a radially inwardly 
projecting flange (245), and a radially inner 

cylindrical wall (250) which sealingly engages the  
 

radially outer surface of the inner wall (222), and the 
secondary piston (270) comprises an outer cylindrical 

wall (271) which is slideably engages the outer 
cylindrical sidewall (244) of the primary piston (241) 

and a radially inwardly projecting flange (274) which 
sealingly engages the inner cylindrical sidewall (250) 

of the primary piston. 
An annular slave cylinder as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 
2 characterised in that the valve means (282) is 

arranged to be open when the primary piston (241) is in 
a fully retracted condition, and to be closed with the 

primary piston (241) is held in an "at-rest" condition 
away from the retracted condition allowing the secondary 

piston (270) to retract relative to the primary piston 
(241) when the valve means is open to compensate for 

clutch wear. 
An annular slave cylinder as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the area of the 

secondary piston (270) exposed to fluid pressure is up 
to 60% of the area of the primary piston (241) exposed 

to fluid pressure. 
An annular slave cylinder as claimed in Claim 3 wherein 
the valve means (282) is a mushroom valve (282) having a  

 
head (283) amd a stem (287), the stem extending through 

an orifice (288) in the flange (245) of the primary 
piston (241) and the head being biased against a seal 

(284) in the closed condition, the stem being abutable 
against a fixed location on the annular body (221) to 

open the valve means. 
An annular slave cylinder as claimed in any one-of 
claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the outer 

cylindrical wall (223) includes an end flange (224) and 
is formed by moulding or casting, the inner cylindrical 

wall (222) is formed from a sheet metal pressing, and 
the inner wall is secured to the outer cylindrical wall 

by deforming a portion (228) of the inner wall adjacent 
the end flange around a portion of the moulding or 

casting. 
An annular slave cylinder as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 6 characterised in that the release bearing 

(60) is mounted on the secondary piston (270) 
concentrically of the second fluid chamber (280).
