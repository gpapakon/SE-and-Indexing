<ABSTRACT>
The electric incandescent lamp has a quartz glass lamp vessel (1) or 
envelope (4') around the lamp vessel, which has a red coloured dope in the area at the 

side of the incandescent body (3). The quartz glass with red dope contains samarium
II
 
oxide, aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide, the analysis of the glass in its oxidised 

form being Sm₂O₃ 1 to 3 % by weight, Al₂O₃ up to 3 % by weight, rest SiO₂, the 
molar ratio Al/Sm being at least 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric incandescent lamp with a tubular 
quartz glass lamp vessel having an axis, in which lap vessel an incandescent body is 
axially arranged and is laterally surrounded by quartz glass with a red dope. The 
invention also relates to a quartz glass tube with a red dope suitable for this electric 
incandescent lamp. Such an incandescent lamp is known from US 3,258,631. The known lamp has a lamp vessel which, laterally of the incandescent 
body, comprises a dope which colours the lamp vessel red, and which is colourless 
around the portions beyond the incandescent body. The manufacture of the lamp vessel starts with a tube of porous glass of 
high SiO₂ content which is impregnated between its ends at the outer surface with a 
solution of salts, for example, of iron, nickel and aluminium salts, and which is 
thermally treated in order to convert the salts into oxides and eliminate the pores. The 
manufacture of the glass tubing for the lamp vessel is very elaborate and therefore 
expensive. GB 2,176,587-A discloses an electric incandescent lamp whose 
incandescent body is laterally surrounded by quartz glass with a red dope in that the 
lamp vessel is accommodated in a tube of that glass. In this lamp, the tube is coupled to 
the lamp by being enclosed between the lamp caps of the lamp so as to form a unit. 
Alternatively, the tube may be a separate body. It is a disadvantage of lamps having an 
enveloping tube that the lamp vessel can only be linear because bending of concentric 
tubes and providing a bent tube around another bent tube are either not possible at all or 
not possible on an industrial scale. A red quartz glass tube is clamped around the lamp vessel by means of 
resilient members in other commercially available lamps. Alternatively, a red quartz 
glass tube may be loosely arranged around the lamp vessel, not as a body coupled to the 
lamp.  Lamps of the kind described may be used for heating purposes, for 
example, for room heating, preparation of food such as cooking, or as a heat source in 
industrial processes such as drying or curing of ink or paint. It is the purpose of the red 
quartz glass to prevent that the light generated by the lamp is radiated with an 
unpleasant intensity. GB 1,036,726 discloses glass compositions of quartz glass with a dope of 
at least a compound of one of the metals having atomic numbers 22 to 29, 60, 62, 68, 
74 and 92, with the possible addition of an aluminium compound. The composition is 
manufactured from the components by

<CLAIMS>
An electric incandescent lamp with a tubular quartz glass lamp vessel (1) 
having an axis (2), in which lamp vessel an incandescent body (3) is axially arranged 

and is laterally surrounded by quartz glass with a red dope, characterized in that the 
quartz glass (4) with the red dope comprises samariumII oxide, aluminium oxide and 

silicon dioxide, and upon analysis in oxidized form is found to contain, apart from 
oxides of trace elements, 1-3% by weight Sm₂O₃, up to 3% by weight Al₂O₃, while the 

remainder is SiO₂, the molar ratio Al/Sm being at least 2. 
An electric incandescent lamp as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that 
the quartz glass lamp vessel (1) is made of the quartz glass with the red dope. 
A quartz glass tube with a red dope suitable for use in the electric 
incandescent lamp as claimed in Claim 1 or 2.
