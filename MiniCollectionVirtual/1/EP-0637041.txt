<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dielectric ceramic
compositions, and particularly to dielectric ceramic compositions
used as materials of a ceramic laminated capacitor
and the like, such as it is, for instance, known from EP-A-0 169 636.Conventionally, as dielectric ceramic compositions
having a small voltage dependency, a high ceramic strength
and a flat dielectric temperature characteristic, those
composed of, for example, BaTiO3 as a main component, to
which bismuth compounds such as Bi2O3 - TiO2 - SnO2, Bi2O3 -
ZrO2 and rare earth elements are added as by-components, are
widely known.While, separate from the dielectric ceramic
compositions having the above-mentioned composition, those
composed of BaTiO3 as a main component, to which Nb2O5, rare
earth oxides and transition metal oxides of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni are added as by-components, have been proposed as the
dielectric ceramic composition which has a flat dielectric 
temperature characteristic, irrespective of its high
dielectric constant of 3000 or more.Temperature characteristics of these dielectric ceramic
compositions is that, X7R characteristics of the EIA
standards is satisfied, or a capacitive change factor based
on an electrostatic capacity at +25°C in a temperature range
of -55°C to +125°C is within ± 15%.In recent years, ceramic laminated capacitors are used
in ECC modules (electronic control devices of an engine)
installed in an engine soon of an automobile. Since the
device is designed for stable control of the engine, viewing
from the temperature stability of circuitries, it is
desirable to satisfy the R characteristics (capacitive
change factor within ± 15%) as the temperature
characteristics of the capacitors being used.While, in winter in cold districts, temperature goes
down to around -20°C in the engine room of the automobile,
and in summer, the temperature rises to around +130°C when
the engine is started. Particularly, when the engine is
over heated, the temperature easily goes up to around
+150°C. Thus, the conventional dielectric ceramic
compositions which satisfy the X7R characteristics can not
cope with the high engine room temperature any longer.Since the laminated capacitors are for use in the
automobile, when it breaks, while being mounted on the 
circuit board, the ECC modules can not function
sufficiently, and in the worst case, there is the
possibility of causing an accident, which must be avoided by
all means. Furthermore, since vibration and stress are
always exerted while the automobile is running, in order to
avoid
