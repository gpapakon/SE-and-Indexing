<ABSTRACT>
A pourer 1 for pouring liqueurs from one of two sub 
containers A, B of a bottle comprises a pourer body 2 

divided into two sections 2A, 2B with respective pouring 
passageways 5A, 5B having outlets 6A, 6B. The outlets 6A, 

6B are closed by separate valve members 20A, 20B which 
allow liqueur to be poured from one sub container A, B at 

one time. The valve members 20A, 20B frictionally engage 
and move with a wiping action, a stud 37 carried by one 

valve member 20 engaging in a respective elongate slot 36 
of the other valve member to ensure that as valve member 

20 is opened the other is automatically closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pourer and in particular to a 
pourer for pouring especially liquids such as alcoholic 
beverage, liqueurs and the like from two or more 
containers. A new liqueur product has recently been introduced which 
is provided in a single container having two sub-containers, 
one for each liqueur. Presently, one of the 
liqueurs is white coloured cream liqueur and the other is 
a dark coloured coffee liqueur. It is intended that a 
user pours the dark liqueur from one of the sub-containers 
into a glass and the white liqueur is then poured down the 
side wall of the glass to lie on top of the dark liqueur 
to present an aesthetically pleasing and pleasant tasting 
liqueur drink. Conventionally the containers are closed 
by separate stoppers which are removed as required for 
pouring a desired liqueur from its container. This invention is particular directed towards provided a 
pourer for pouring from two or more containers of this 
type. According to the invention there is provided a pourer for 
pouring from two or more containers comprising:
 
   a pourer body having a pourer body section 
for each container;
 
   each pourer body section having engagement 
means for engaging a container outlet and 
defining a pouring passageway extending from 
the engagement means to a pourer outlet; and  
 
the pourer including valve means for 
selectively opening and closing the pourer 
outlets for pouring from the containers. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention 
the valve means comprises a separate valve member for each 
pourer outlet. Most preferably the pourer body includes two pourer body 
sections, a separate valve member being provided for each 
pourer outlet. Preferably the valve members are arranged so that one 
valve member may be opened at one time. The valve members may be interconnected such that one 
valve member is automatically closed when the other valve 
member is opened. In a particularly preferred arrangement each valve member 
includes a stud and an elongate slot, the stud of one 
valve member engaging with the slot of the other valve 
member, the stud travelling in the slot on movement of one 
valve member to the open position and engaging with the 
slot in the open position to prevent the opening of the 
other valve member. Preferably the valve members are pivotally mounted to the 
pourer body for movement between the open and closed 
position. In a preferred arrangement the valve members are mounted 
on a common pivot.  Preferably the valve members are

<CLAIMS>
A pourer (1) for pouring from two or more 
containers (A,B) comprising : 

   a pourer body (2) having a pourer body 
section (2A,2B) for each container (A,B); 

   each pourer body section (2A,2B) having 
engagement means (3A,3B) for engaging a 

container outlet (C,D) and defining a pouring 
passageway (5A,5B) extending from the 

engagement means (3A,3B) to a pourer outlet 
(6A, 6B); and 

   the pourer (1) including valve means (20A, 
20B) for selectively opening and closing the 

pourer outlets (6A,6B) for pouring from the 
containers (A,B).
