<ABSTRACT>
Automatic fragmentation of data occurs using the present invention without 
the intervention of an operator/user. Whenever the amount of data being received 

by a data processing system is too large to fit onto the currently being 
used storage device, the data is fragmented and sent to additional storage devices 

which are associated with the data processing device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to computer software, and in particular to a 
method and apparatus for improving the fault tolerance of multi-media document 
management systems. Modern document management systems are becoming increasingly complex to 
support sophisticated hierarchically structured documents such as folders and 
for accommodating the storage and management of an open-ended set of document 
types including multi-media objects such as audio and video. However, 
the design of such document management systems has not kept pace with the 
demands for fault tolerant operation of such systems. Fault tolerance is defined 
as the ability to cope with failures and/or environmental shortcomings 
and function as intended, although there may be a still noticeable degradation 
in performance. Such systems support the storage and management of complex 
objects which are comprised of multi-media component objects such as 
image, voice, and video. Typically, each of these objects require storage on the 
order of several hundred megabytes of space. Currently, file systems are based on use of a single disk. When the data is 
being received for storage, it is not generally known how much of the remaining 
storage space will be needed. Once the space is filled, a disk error will be 
received. If a programmer/operator is monitoring the system, the programmer 
will have to select a new storage location for receipt of the remaining data for 
which there has been no break in the transmission thereof. Thus, even if a 
programmer is monitoring the system, any data sent subsequent to the filling 
of the current storage device and prior to the selection of a new storage device  
 
will be lost. If no one is monitoring the system, all the data sent subsequent 
to the filling of the current storage space will be lost. An exception to the loss 
of all sent data, is the case in which the user program has been written to look 
for extra space when the current storage location is filled. This addition to a 
user program requires considerable extra effort to be included and is not typically 
done. Consequently, the robustness or reliability (which has taken a more significant 
role) of such systems has suffered. Therefore, the system becomes unfriendly 
and not fault tolerant because the burden of handling deficiencies is placed on 
the user. Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus which improves 
the fault tolerance of multi-media document management systems. The present invention provides a method and apparatus

<CLAIMS>
A method of improving fault tolerance of a document management system 
for a data processing device, comprising the steps of: 

   automatically dividing data being received by the data processing device 
into a plurality of fragments whenever a currently being used storage device 

associated with the data processing device has insufficient space to store all of 
said data; and 

   automatically storing said fragments on additional predetermined storage 
devices, also associated with the data processing device, as necessary. 
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of: 
   forming a fragment table to identify where said fragments are stored. 
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of: 
   forming a diskspace availability table to inform the management system 

of said additional storage devices. 
A system for improving fault tolerance of document management of a data 
processing device, comprising: 

   means for automatically dividing data being received by the data processing 
device into a plurality of fragments whenever a currently being used storage 

device associated with the data processing device has insufficient space to 
store all of said data; and 

   means for automatically storing said fragments on additional predetermined 
storage devices, also associated with the data processing device, as necessary. 
The system of Claim 4, further comprising: 
   means for forming a fragment table to identify where said fragments are 

stored. 
The system of Claim 4, further comprising: 
   means for forming a diskspace availability table to inform the management 

system of said additional storage devices.
