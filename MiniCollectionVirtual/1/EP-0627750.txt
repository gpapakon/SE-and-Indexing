<ABSTRACT>
A combined current and voltage transformer for high voltages 
consists of a current transformer of inverse type placed in 

the transformer head (1) and an inductive voltage transformer 
with a stack magnetic core (9). The secondary leads 

(7) of the current transformer are laid by or through the 
open magnetic core (9) of the voltage transformer, which 

together with its appertaining secondary winding (11) of the 
voltage transformer is placed in the vertical axis of the 

transformer inside an earthed supporting tube (8) and around 
which is placed the insulation of the voltage transformer 

(12), which together with the insulation of the current 
transformer in the area of the head (5) make an unseparably 

entity. The sections of the primary winding (13) of the 
voltage transformer are placed vertically inside the 

supporting insulator (2) around the insulation of the 
voltage transformer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a combined current 
and voltage transformer for high voltages which consists of 
a current transformer of inverse type placed in the transformer 
head and an inductive voltage transformer with a 
stack magnetic core. Combined current and voltage transformers are mostly made as 
separate isolated current or rather voltage transformer put 
into one or two housings with a joint supporting insulator. Such a design of combined transformers presents a technical 
solution, which, applied for high voltage transformers, 
results in an expensive and unsuitable design due to 
enlarged dimensions and weight of transformer. According to the current prior art the inductive combined 
transformers are made in such way that the current transformer 
and voltage transformer with a closed magnetic core 
are placed in one common or two separate metal housings, 
which practically means that all sorts of combinations in 
distribution are possible. The most frequently seen variants 
are that the current transformer is of the inverse type, 
placed in the head, whereas the voltage transformer is in 
the base, or both transformers are in the head of the 
combined transformer. In the latter variant there are two 
combinations possible, meaning that the active part of the 
voltage transformer can be placed above or below the current 
transformer. DE-U 72 34 359 describes a well-known solution. The problem 
is solved in such a way that the round core of the voltage 
transformer, with the appertaining primary and secondary 
winding, is placed under the inverse current transformer. 
The whole active part is sealed into a compact body of 
artificial resin and placed inside the supporting insulator.  In the window of the horizontaly placed core of the voltage 
transformer there is a metal tube through which the 
secondary leads of the voltage transformer are conducted. 
This tube is joined in the middle of the window with the 
metal tube of the current transformer where secondary leads 
of the current and voltage transformer intertwine, and they 
reach the base of the transformer through a common vertical 
metal tube. The basic disadvantage of this solution is that the volume, 
mass and height of the transformer head are comparatively 
big in relation to the supporting insulator and this 
proportion grows with increased rated voltage of the 
transformer. Furthermore, due to the distribution of weight, 
the center of gravity of the transformer is high above the 
base of the transformer so that such
