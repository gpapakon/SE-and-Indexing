<ABSTRACT>
Assembling and checking microwave circuit modules is accomplished 
by storing results of checks of active elements 

after the manufacture, determining (5) a combination of 
active elements according to the stored results or data, 

calculating (6) the characteristic value of the determined 
combination according to the results of checks of the 

active elements in the combination, computing (7), if the 
calculated characteristic value is out of a predetermined 

range, a content and an amount of adjustment to be made in 
a substrate so as to correct the characteristic value to be 

in the predetermined range, and adjusting (9) the substrate 
according to the result of computation (7). By selecting 

an appropriate combination, the chips whose characteristic 
value falls outside of the predetermined range are saved 

from being discarded, so that a low cost microwave circuit 
module can be obtained at a high overall yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a microwave circuit module, and more
particularly to a method of assembling, testing and tuning microwave
circuit modules which are used for microwave communication
systems and the like.An MMIC (microwave monolithic integrated circuit) is
now in the stage of practical utilization. An ultra-high
frequency integrated circuit is greatly different from the
general digital IC in that it cannot be realized only with
lumped parameter circuits but requires distributed element
circuits because of the short wavelength.However, the above MMIC is not suited
for large scale integration of distributed element circuits.
The distributed element circuit needs an area
determined by the wavelength, and it usually requires a
large area for installation or mounting.The increased size in the MMIC is disadvantageous from
the points that gallium arsenide (GaAs) is often utilized,
that thin wafers are preferred in view of characteristic 
requirements, and that the cost becomes high. In these
respects, the MMIC is not suited for the large-scale integration.As means for solving the above problems and economically
realizing large-scale integrated microwave circuits including
distributed constant circuit elements, the inventor has
proposed "Composite Microwave Circuit Module" (Japanese
Patent Application No. Hei 4(1992) - 291031 - JP-A-6 232 608,
published 19.08.94).Fig. 10 shows the composite microwave circuit module
disclosed in the patent application referred to above. As
shown therein, a dielectric substrate which is formed as a
lamination of multiple layers is provided with ground
surfaces formed of conductive layers comprised of an upper
and a lower layer 26 and 23, and signal circuits 24 and 25
formed of one or more conductive layers for signal transmission
and disposed in an intermediate layer portion of
the substrates.Further, in this composite microwave circuit module, a
shield surrounding the signal circuits 24 and 25 is formed
by through-holes 32 and 34 which are formed around the
signal circuits 24 and 25 for short-circuiting the two
ground surfaces. These circuits include active elements
28, such as MMICs, ICs, transistors, diodes, etc., and 
passive elements, which are formed by patterning of strip
lines, microstrip lines, coplanar lines, etc, these elements
being electrically connected to one another to obtain
an integrated structure.Referring to Fig. 10, designated at 20 is a base
plate, at 21 a layered capacitor, at 22 a conductive cap,
at 27 a wiring or

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a microwave circuit module
having a plurality of active elements mounted on a

substrate, comprising the steps of:

testing characteristics of all active elements (A, B, C) in a
batch of semiconductor wafers (1a, 1b, 1c);
storing the test data of the characteristics of all the
active elements

other than those found to be defective or whose characteristics
fall outside a tolerable fluctuation range

in a memory (3a, 3b, 3c), wherein said data are
stored individually in correspondence to the respective active

element to which the data belongs; 
in a computational process
selecting and combining the active elements for which test data has been stored to

form a plurality of combinations, each of which is destined to form, together with a
substrate, a respective microwave circuit module, whereby the selection and

combination is effected by combining active elements such that their
combined characteristics

as computed from the test data
lie as close as possible to the desired value whilst

maximising the number of active elements used in total from said batch of wafers;
for each combination thus selected whose combined characteristics fall outside a
desired range about said desired value, 

computing, the amount of
adjustment to be made to resistors and/or microstrips in the substrate

to which the devices are to be mounted in order that
the over-all characteristics

of the resulting microwave circuit module
are within the desired

specifications;
adjusting the substrate according to the computed amount
of adjustment; and
assembling the active elements in said selected
combination on said adjusted substrate.
The method according to claim 1, further comprising a
step of

measuring the characteristics of the substrate, followed by
calculating the over-all module characteristics

obtainable when the active elements in said combination
are assembled on said substrate based on the

measured characteristics of said substrate and said
active elements. 
The method according to claim 2, further comprising the
steps of:


measuring module characteristics of the microwave
circuit module assembled in said assembling step;

analyzing the center of deviation of said module
characteristics from the desired characteristics of

said microwave circuit module obtained in said
measurement step; and
feeding back results of the analysis of the deviation
to the step of selecting and combining the

active elements in order to compensate for the deviation of
the measured module characteristics from the desired characteristics

in the step of selecting and combining and the steps of computing the amount of
substrate adjustment.
