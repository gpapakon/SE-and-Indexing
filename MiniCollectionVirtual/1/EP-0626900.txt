<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a process for recycling moulded, especially blow-moulded or deep-drawn, hollow bodies from plastic material. Here, strips (1, 3, 4) are cut or shaved from the shaped plastic hollow bodies. The strips (1, 3, 4) are jumbled together and subjected in this arrangement to a temperature below the melting point of the plastic material. Hereby the individual strips (1,3 , 4) deform spatially and cling together.

Method of treating shaped, in particular blown or deep-drawn, 
hollow bodies of plastics material in which strips (1, 3, 4) are cut 

or shaved from the shaped hollow plastics bodies, the strips (1,3,4) 
are arranged in a tangled or chaotic relationship to one another and 

in this arrangement they are subjected to a temperature below the 
melting temperature of the plastics material, at which the individual 

strips, (1, 3, 4), are spatially deformed and hooked together. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that,
 the strips (1) 
are cut in the direction of the length of the hollow plastics body. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that,
 the strips 
(3) are cut in a transverse direction in relation to the hollow 

plastics body. 
Method according to one or more of the foregoing claims, 
characterised in that, the plastics material is polyethylene 

terephthalate. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the strips (1, 3) 
are exposed to a temperature between 80°C and 120°C, in 

particular a temperature of 120°C. 
Method according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in 
that the strips have a width of about 0.5 to 2.5 mm and the length 

of the cut hollow body.  
 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3 and 6, characterised in 
that the plastics material is polypropylene. 
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that the strips are 
exposed to a temperature of about 120°C to 170°C. 
Method according to claim 1 to 3 and 6, characterised in that the 
plastics material is polystyrene. 
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that the strips are 
exposed to a temperature of about 110°C to 170°C . 
Method of treating shaped hollow bodies of plastics material in 
which the hollow plastics body is cut up and fibre-like strips are 

shaved from the cut-up material, whereby the individual strips curl 
up. 
Method according to claim 11, characterised in that the strips have 
a length of about 5 cm and a width of 0.1 mm. 
Three-dimensional plastics body manufactured by the method 
according to one of claims 1 or 2 and 4 to 10, in which strips (1, 4) 

cut or shaved from a shaped hollow plastics body in the direction 
of its length are present hooked together to form a "tangled ball" 

(2). 
Three-dimensional plastics body manufactured by the method 
according to one of claims 1 and 3 to 10 in which strips (3, 4) cut 

or shaved from a shaped hollow plastics body in a transverse 
direction are present loosely hooked together.  

 
The use of the body produced by the method according to one of 
claims 1 - 12 as a filler for washers, bio-reactors, upholstered 

furniture or packaging containers. 
The use of the three-dimensional plastics body according to claim 
13 or 14 for producing a body having large-area extent by bonding 

together the individual bodies.
