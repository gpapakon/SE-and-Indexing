<ABSTRACT>
A unique nucleic acid subfragment encoding lysine-insensitive aspartokinase (AK) is capable of causing a higher than normal production of threonine, when linked to a nucleic acid subfragment encoding lysine-insensitive dihydrodipicolinic acid synthase (DHDPS) higher than normal production of lysine. A further embodiment also includes a subfragment encoding antisense lysine ketoglutarate reductase. Nucleic acid sequences and chimeric genes are provided, as well as methods for increasing the lysine or threonine content of seeds of plants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unique synthetic
nucleic acid subfragment encoding aspartokinase (AK)
which is insensitive to inhibition by lysine. Methods
for its use to produce increased levels of lysine or
threonine in transformed organisms are also provided.Human food and animal feed derived from many grains
are deficient in some of the ten essential amino acids
which are required in the animal diet. In corn (Zea
mays L.), lysine is the most limiting amino acid for the
dietary requirements of many animals. Soybean (Glycine
max L.) meal is used as an additive to corn based animal
feeds primarily as a lysine supplement. Thus an
increase in the lysine content of either corn or soybean
would reduce or eliminate the need to supplement mixed
grain feeds with lysine produced via fermentation of
microbes.Plant breeders have long been interested in using
naturally occuring variations to improve protein quality
and quantity in crop plants. Maize lines containing
higher than normal levels of lysine (70%) have been
identified (Mertz, Science, 145, 279 (1964) and Nelson,
Science, 150, 1469-70 (1965)). However, these lines
which incorporate a mutant gene, opaque-2, exhibit poor
agronomic qualities (increased susceptibility to disease
and pests, 8-14% reduction in yield, low kernel weight,
slower drying, lower dry milling yield of flaking grits,
and increased storage problems) and thus are not
commercially useful [Deutscher, D. Adv. Exp. Medicine
and Biology, 105, 281-300 (1978)]. Quality Protein 
Maize (QPM) bred at CIMMYT using the opaque-2 and
sugary-2 genes and associated modifiers has a hard
endosperm and enriched levels of lysine and tryptophan
in the kernels [Vasal, S. K., et al. Proceedings of the
3rd seed protein symposium, Gatersleben, August 31 -
September 2, 1983]. However, the gene pools represented
in the QPM lines are tropical and subtropical. Quality
Protein Maize is a genetically complex trait and the
existing lines are not easily adapted to the dent
germplasm in use in the United States, preventing the
adoption of QPM by corn breeders.The amino acid content of seeds is determined
primarily (90-99%) by the amino acid composition of the
proteins in the seed and to a lesser extent (1-10%) by
the free amino acid pools. The quantity of total
protein in seeds varies from about 10% of the dry weight
in cereals to 20-40% of the dry weight of legumes. Much
of the protein-bound amino acids is contained in the
seed storage proteins which are synthesized during seed
development and which serve as a major
