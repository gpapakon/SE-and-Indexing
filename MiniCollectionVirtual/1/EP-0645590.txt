<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a driving control device for an
air conditioner with a plurality of air conditioning control
systems, in particular, relates to measures for indication in
an integral control unit.In conventional air conditioners, as shown in the Japanese
Patent Laying Open Gazette No.3-213941, a plurality of
indoor control units for controlling respective indoor units
are connected to an outdoor control unit for controlling an
outdoor unit via branch control units, and a remote control
is connected to the indoor control units, in which temperature
setting and driving mode are switched by the remote control.In addition, a group of the indoor control units connected
to each branch control unit control air conditioning in the
same driving mode. Since a plurality of remote controls may be
connected to each group of the indoor control units, an option
to switch the driving mode can be set to one of the remote
controls, i.e., one of the indoor control units, so that the
driving mode can be switched only by the remote control having 
the above option.In the above-mentioned air conditioner, the remote control
is connected to the indoor control unit to switch the
driving mode and the like and indicates the present driving
mode. Thus, the air conditioner has a disadvantage in operability.In detail, recently, the number of indoor units to be
provided in a single air conditioner has been increased so
that the desire to control many indoor units at a single place
has grown. In particular, there is a case where a plurality of
outdoor units are provided. In this case, just indicating the
option to switch the driving mode by the remote control as in
the conventional device invites a problem of the impossibility
of integral management.More specifically, in the integral management of air
conditioning, it is required to recognize which outdoor control
unit each indoor control unit belongs to and which indoor
control unit has the option for switching the driving mode. A
new driving control device having the ability of the above
recognitions has been desired.This invention has been made in view of the forgoing
problems and has its object of integrally managing the air
conditioning control systems to which respective user-side
control units belong and the options for switching the driving 
mode.To attain the above object, this invention is designed to
indicate in an integral control unit the air conditioning
control system to which the user-side control units belong and
the option for switching the driving mode.In
