<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of securing connection tags to electrical conductors in thermal foils and the like in which a contact plate is riveted in place near a hole passing through plastic layers (1, 2) and a metal part (3). In this method the contact plate (9) is riveted in place near a hole (4) passing through the plastic layers and a metal foil (3) arranged adjacent to the layers (1, 2), by means of a hollow rivet (6) which is passed through the hole. On the opposite side of the hole the rivet has been bent around an upset (8) at the lower edge of the hole, the hole (4) having been made with the aid of a mandrel (5), suitably hot and at least partly conical in shape, so that the upper edge of the hole is flanged to a recessed sealing surface for the rivet (6), the central part has been formed to an exposed cylindrical metal contact surface (7) against the rivet (6), and the lower side to a sealing upset (8), preferably reinforced at the edge, increasing the contact pressure and hermetically sealing the area around the contact surface.

 METHOD OF JOINING CONNECTION PLATES . Technical fieldThe present invention relates to a method of securing electrical connection tags to electrical conductors in printed circuits in thermal foils and the like, in which a contact plate is riveted in place near a hole passing through plastic layers and a metal part.Background ArtA problem with thermal foils and other components having printed circuits is that the electrical conductors are extremely thin which makes it difficult to attach contact plates and similar contact members without risk of damage, sparking, poor contact, etc.Summary of the InventionThe object of the invention is to provide a method for solving this and other associated problems, and is characterised in that the contact plate is riveted in place near a hole passing through the plastic layers and a metal foil arranged adjacent to the layers, by means of a rivet, preferably a hollow rivet, which is passed through the hole and bent on the opposite side around an upset at the lower edge of the hole, the hole being made with the aid of a mandrel, suitably hot and at least partly conical in shape, so that the upper edge of the hole is flanged to a recessed sealing surface for the rivet, the central part is formed to an exposed cylindrical metal contact surface against the rivet, and the lower side to a sealing upset, preferably reinforced at the edge, increasing the contact pressure and hermetically sealing the area around the contact surface. A reliable and easily applied contact to the contact plate is thus obtained from the metal foil, and such a thermal foil can easily be applied in a floor with flooring on top with negligible risk of damage to the thermal foil or the flooring.In a preferred embodiment a ring with protrusions directed axially downwards is applied between the contact plate and the upper plastic layer, said ring being pressed through the layer into contact with the metal foil during riveting. This provides better electrical contact between contact plate and metal foil. The ring is suitably coated with electrically conducting paint.DrawingsThe invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a hole produced in what is to become a metal foil, 

 Figure 2 shows application of a hot mandrel, Figure 3 removal of the mandrel, Figure 4 application of the contact plate and Figures 5 and 6 the arrangement of an intermediate ring provided with protrusions.Description of the DrawingsFigure 1 shows two plastic layers 1,

CLAIMS;
1. A method of securing connection tags to electrical conductors in printed circuits in thermal foils and the like in which a contact plate is riveted in place near a hole passing through plastic layers 1, 2 and a metal part 3, characterised in that the contact plate 9 is riveted in place near a hole 4 passing through the plastic layers 1, 2 and a metal foil 3 arranged adjacent to the layers, by means of a rivet, preferably a hollow rivet 6, which is passed through the hole and bent on the opposite side around an upset 8 at the lower edge of the hole, the hole 4 being made with the aid of a mandrel 5, suitably hot and at least partly conical in shape, so that the upper edge of the hole is flanged to a recessed sealing surface for the rivet 6, the central part is formed to an exposed cylindrical metal contact surface 7 against the rivet 6, and the lower side to a sealing upset 8, preferably reinforced at the edge, increasing the contact pressure and hermetically sealing the area around the contact surface.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that between the contact plate 9 and the upper plastic layer 1 a ring 10 with protrusions directed axially downwards is applied, said ring being pressed through the layer into contact with the metal foil during riveting.
3. A method as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the ring 10 is coated with electrically conducting paint
4. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that a protective layer of glass fibre, for instance, is applied on the finished thermal foil to protect the thermal foil and to facilitate laying flooring on top of the foil in the case of electrically heated floors, for instance.

CLAIMS:
1. A method of securing connection tags to electrical conductors in printed circuits in thermal foils and the like in which a contact plate is riveted in place near a hole passing through plastic layers 1, 2 and a metal part 3, characterised in that the through-hole (4) in the plastic layers (1, 2) is flanged by means of a mandrel (5), suitably hot and at least partly conical in shape, so that the upper edge of the hole is flanged to a recessed sealing surface for the rivet (6), the central part is formed to an exposed cylindrical metal contact surface (7) against the rivet (6), and the lower side to a sealing upset 8, preferably reinforced at the edge, increasing the contact pressure and hermetically sealing the area around the contact surface, and in that the contact plate 9 is riveted in place near the through-hole 4 in the plastic layers (1, 2) and a metal foil (3) arranged adjacent to the layers, by means of a rivet, preferably a hollow rivet (6), which is passed through the hole and bent on the opposite side around an upset at the lower edge of the hole.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that between the contact plate (9) and the upper plastic layer (1) a ring (10) with protrusions directed axially downwards is applied, said ring being pressed through the layer into contact with the metal foil during riveting.
3. A method as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that between the contact plate (9) and the upper plastic layer (1) a ring (10) is applied, said ring being coated with electrically conducting paint and provided with protrusions directed axially downwards, which are pressed through the layer into contact with the metal foil during riveting.
4. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that a protective layer of glass fibre, for instance, is applied on the finished theÏ€nal foil.
