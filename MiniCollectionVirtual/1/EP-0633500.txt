<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive
composition suitable for the manufacture of lithographic
plates, IC circuits, and photomasks. More particularly, this
invention relates to a photosensitive composition comprising a
photosensitive compound, e.g., an o-naphthoquinone diazide
compound, and a polymer soluble in either an alkaline aqueous
solution or an alkaline solvent consisting mainly of water
(hereinafter referred to as "soluble in an aqueous alkali
solution").A photosensitive composition comprising an o-naphthoquinone
diazide compound and a phenolic novolak resin
has been industrially used as an exceedingly good
photosensitive composition in the manufacture of lithographic
plates and as a photoresist.However, due to the properties of the phenolic novolak
resin used as a major component, the composition has had
drawbacks, for example, that it shows poor adherence to
substrates and gives a coating film which is brittle, has poor
wear resistance, and shows insufficient impression capacity
when used in a lithographic plate. The applications of the
composition has therefore been limited. In order to overcome these problems, various polymers
have been investigated as binders. For example, the
poly(hydroxystyrene) or hydroxystyrene copolymer described in
JP-B-52-41050 has undoubtedly improved film properties but has
had a drawback of poor wear resistance. (The term "JP-B" as
used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication.")On the other hand, in JP-A-63-226641 corresponding to DE-A-3742387
is described a positive-working photosensitive
composition comprising as a binder an active imino group-containing
polymer. As disclosed in this document, the active
imino groups in the polymer have a degree of dissociation (pKa)
of from 4 to 11, preferably of from 5 to 9. Further, this
document discloses a process for image formation using a 4 wt.%
aqueous solution of sodium metasilicate as developer. There is
a description therein to the effect that the composition is
improved in film properties, adherence to substrates, and wear
resistance.Further, photosensitive compositions comprising a
conventional phenolic resin have been disadvantageous in that
they should be developed usually with an aqueous alkali
solution having a pH as high as 13 or above and use of such a
high-pH developing solution is never preferable from the
standpoints of safety in handling and of treatment of the waste
liquor resulting from development. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a photosensitive
