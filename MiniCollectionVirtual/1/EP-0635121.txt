<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for mounting an instrument
manifold on a main flow line at a restriction, such as an orifice fitting assembly, for
the transmitting of high and low fluid pressure pulses or signals to a fluid pressure
measuring device for measuring the fluid pressure, and more particularly to such a
method and apparatus especially designed for transmitting radially directed forces
from the manifold to the main flow line.Heretofore, such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,920,626 dated May 1,1990,
apparatus has been provided for mounting an instrument manifold on a main flow line
for transmitting radially directed forces between the instrument manifold and an
orifice plate assembly or fitting on the main flow line. The mounting apparatus
includes a pair of generally identical stabilized connector subassemblies connected
between the instrument manifold and the orifice plate assembly with one connector
subassembly being connected to a high pressure fluid port on the upstream side of the
orifice plate and the other connector subassembly being connected to a low pressure
fluid port on the downstream side of the orifice plate. Each connector subassembly
comprises a connector body having an inner externally threaded end for threading
within an associated fluid port on the orifice assembly and an outer flange for
connection to a mating flange on the instrument manifold. The tapered threads on the
inner end of the connector body form a fluid tight metal-to-metal seal with the
associated fluid port and leakage may occur if such threads crack or are loosened
such as might result from radial forces exerted against the connector body and
continuous deflection of the connector body from such radial loads or forces.The stabilized connector shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,920,626 transmits radial
forces from the manifold to an outer end portion of the connector body, and then
from the outer end portion to a tensioning nut for transmitting the radial forces to the
surface of the orifice assembly at a position radially spaced from the threaded inner 
end of the connector body thereby to minimize or prevent radial forces from being
transmitted through the threaded inner end of the connector body to the orifice
assembly. The weight of the manifold and equipment connected thereto, such as
fluid pressure transmitters, exerts a static radial load on the stabilized connector.
Dynamic radial loads such as provided by vibrations, seismic activity, or exerted by
workmen or the like contacting the manifold or
