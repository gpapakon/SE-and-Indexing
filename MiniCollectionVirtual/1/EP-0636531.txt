<ABSTRACT>
An axle beam type rear suspension of an automotive 
vehicle comprises a pair of trailing arms (19) located respectively 

at the right and left sides of a vehicle body (B). Each trailing arm 
is mounted through a bushing (40) on a support shaft (39) bridging 

inboard and outboard side brackets (10,11) which are spaced from 
each other and fixed to a rear side member (1). The outboard side 

bracket (11) extends downward over the lower end of a side sill (4) 
fixedly secured to the rear side member. A parking brake 

cable (32) is disposed between the trailing arm and the outboard 
side bracket and located at a position upper than the lower 

end of the outboard side bracket, thereby preventing the 
parking brake cable from interfering with an attachment of a 

vehicle lifting device when the vehicle is raised to make 
vehicle maintenance of repairing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in a structure or
arrangement of an automotive vehicle in connection with a
suspension, and more particularly to a vehicle structure by
which a parking brake cable is prevented from interfering
with an attachment of a vehicle lifting device or jack during a
vehicle raising operation.Automotive vehicles are equipped with a parking brake
including a parking brake cable which is disposed under the
floor of a vehicle body and extends to the central support
section of a rear road wheel. The parking brake cable passes
by the trailing arm of a rear suspension. It is assumed that
the parking brake is located outboard of the trailing arm.However, drawbacks have been encountered in such a
conventional vehicle arrangement in which the parking brake
cable is disposed outboard of the trailing arm. That is, when
the vehicle body is raised by a lifting device or jack for the
purpose of vehicle maintenance and repairing, an attachment
of the lifting device is first brought into contact with a jack-up
point at the lower end of a side sill which is located near and
outboard of the trailing arm, followed by raising the whole
vehicle by the lifting device. At this time, if the attachment of
the lifting device is slightly shifted inboard with no intention,
the attachment comes into interference with the parking
brake cable. As a result, there is the possibility of the parking
brake cable being put between the attachment and the
trailing arm at a position where the trailing arm is securely
supported. US-A-4,106,807 according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1 discloses a vehicle
structure comprising a side sill and a rear side member which is fixedly disposed inboard
of said side sill. Two oppositely disposed brackets are secured to said rear side member
which are connected by support shaft. The support shaft supports a trailing arm.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved vehicle structure by which drawbacks encountered 
in conventional vehicle structures have been overcome
without using any complicated device.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
improved vehicle structure by which a parking brake cable
can be effectively prevented from interfering with a part of a
vehicle lifting device when the vehicle is raised by the lifting
device.A further object of the present invention is to provide
an improved vehicle structure by which a parking brake cable
can be effectively prevented from being put between a
trailing arm and an attachment of

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle structure comprising:

a side sill (4) forming part of the vehicle body (B);
a rear side member (1) fixedly disposed inboard of said side sill (4);
a first bracket (10) fixedly secured to said rear side member (1);
a second bracket (11) fixedly secured to said rear side member (1) and
spaced from said first bracket (10), said second bracket (11) being

located outboard of said first bracket (10);
a support shaft (39) connecting said first and second brackets (10,11);
and
a trailing arm (19) mounted through a bushing (40) on said support shaft
(39);

characterized in that
said second bracket (11) has a lower end (11f) which is located at a
position lower in level than a lower end (4f) of said side sill (4); and
a parking brake cable (32) is disposed below said bushing (4) and
outboard of said trailing arm (19).
A vehicle structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein said parking brake
cable (32) is disposed between said trailing arm (19) and said second

bracket (11). 
A vehicle structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein the position of the lower
end (11f) of said second bracket (11) generally corresponds to that of the

said bushing (40) in a fore-and aft direction of the vehicle body (B).
A vehicle structure as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a brace (41)
disposed between said rear side member (1) and said second bracket

(11), said brace (41) having a generally ]-shaped cross-section and

including a first wall section fixedly secured to said rear side member (1),
a second wall section (42) fixedly secured to said second bracket (11),

and a third wall section (43) fixedly secured to said second bracket (42),
said first wall section being integral with said second and third wall

sections (42,43).
A vehicle structure as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a vehicle
body member (14) forming part of the vehicle body (B) and joined with

said rear side member (1), said vehicle body member (14) extending in a
lateral direction of the vehicle body and having a bracket (13) extending

downward , and axle beam (18) spaced from and extending parallel with
said vehicle body member (14), a Panhard rod (12) extending generally

parallel with said axle beam (18) and having a first end (20a) securely
connected to the bracket (13) of said vehicle body member (14) and a

second end (20b) securely connected to said axle beam (18), and an
assist link (28) having a first end (28a) securely connected to said axle

beam (18) and a second end (286) securely connected to said Panhard
rod (12).
A vehicle structure as claimed in claim 5, further comprising an
unisotropic, bushing (26) through which said Panhard rod second end
