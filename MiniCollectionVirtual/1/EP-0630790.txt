<ABSTRACT>
The unit runs in slides on either side and the cover (1) takes the form of a hood with side walls and a roof section, with drive rollers (8) on the undersides of both side walls. At least one operating point (10) is located near to the running gear and loading surfaces, in the lower region of one of the side walls of the moving cover. This operating point is connected to a drive (rack (17) and pinion (16)) on the same side. The gearbox carries a shaft (12) to transfer the drive force from the operating point to the rack and pinion on the opposite side of the cover.

Cover (1) with a drive apparatus, the cover 

extending over a load platform of a vehicle, particularly of a railway freight 
wagon, 
having a portal or bonnet shape in cross section with side wall sections and 
roof sections and having running gears (8) arranged at the lower edges of the side 

wall sections on either side, 
being movable to and fro by moving said running gears (8) along lateral running 
rails (9) between a closed and an open position,
 
a transmission gear (11) being provided, comprising means (12) guided along the 

tunnel arch constituted by the portal shaped cover (1) for transmitting a unilaterally 
introduced force for opening or closing the cover to drive means (16, 17) at the 

opposite side wall section of the cover (1), and
 
the drive means (16, 17) comprising fixed elements on the vehicle side and movable 

elements on the cover side corresponding to said fixed elements, 
characterized in
 that at least one operating station (10) arranged adjacent to the 
running gear and the loading surface in the lower part of one of the side wall 

sections of the movable cover (1) is coupled to driving means (16, 17) provided on 
the same side as well as to said drive (11) for a direct force or torque introduction. 
Cover according to claim 1,
characterized in
 that said transmission gear comprises a non self-locking angle 
transmission (11) on either side wall section of the cover as well as a flexible or 

cardan shaft (12) guided along the tunnel arch constituted by the portal shaped  
 

cover (1) and drivingly connecting the two angle transmissions (11) to each other via 
branch shafts (15). 
Cover according to claim 2,
characterized in
 that the flexible or cardan shaft (12) extends essentially along a 
hollow space constituted by a tube supporting an outer skin (5) of the cover (1) and 

is guided radially in the tube. 
Cover according to claim 2 or 3,
characterized in
 that driving forces are transmittable between the vehicle elements 
and the cover elements of the drive means (16, 17) via positive engagement. 
Cover according to claim 4,
characterized in
 that a pinion (16) is provided on either side section of the cover (1) 
intermeshing with a rack (17) fixed on the same side to an underframe (2, 2') of the 

vehicle,
 
the respective pinions (16) being drivable in an equidirectional rotation along the 

respective rack by means of the at least one operating station (10), the angle 
transmissions (11) and the shaft (12) connecting the transmissions (11) to each 

other. 
Cover according to claim 5,
characterized in
 that the rack (17) is designed as a roller chain supported by the 
underframe (2) at least at several points distant from each other. 
Cover according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in
 that driving forces are transmittable between the vehicle elements 
and the cover elements of the drive means (16, 17) by frictional transmission.  

 
Cover according to claim 4 or 7,
characterized in
 that at either side section of the cover at least one roller of one of 
the running gears (8) is drivable by means of the operating station (10), the angle 

transmissions (11) and the shaft (12) in an equidirectional rotation. 
Cover according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in
 that at least one operating station (10) is provided on either side of 
the cover (1). 
Cover according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in
 that at the at least one operating station (10) a hand-switched 
coupling is provided for disengaging movable elements of the drive means (16, 17) 

from the at least one operating station (10).
