<ABSTRACT>
A printing blanket (15) adapted to be used with a magnetic printing cylinder (12) including a gap (16) extending longitudinally along the outer surface thereof is provided. The printing blanket (15) includes a plurality of piles (14) with a magnetic backing ply (20) which is magnetically adhered to the printing cylinder (12). The printing blanket (15) is positioned on the printing cylinder (12) such that an end (22) of the printing blanket (15) is bent over an edge (11) and inwardly into the gap (16). The opposite end (24) of the printing blanket (15) is mounted substantially adjacent the opposite edge of the gap (16). The tensioning roll (150) or similar device to which the printing blanket (15) may be attached can be disposed in the gap (16) to secure the printing blanket (15) to the printing cylinder (12) more firmly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a printing blanket 
construction, and more particularly, to an improved end design for 
a printing blanket adapted to be used with a magnetic printing 
cylinder. The type of printing blanket to which is referred herein 
is used primarily in offset lithographic printing, but may also 
find utility in other fields of printing. In the art of offset lithography, a rotary cylinder is covered with 
a printing plate which normally has a positive image area receptive 
to oil-based inks and repellant to water and a background area 
where the opposite is true. The printing plate is rotated so that 
its surface contacts a second cylinder covered with an ink-receptive 
printing blanket having an elastomeric surface. The ink 
present on the image surface of the printing plate transfers, or 
offsets, to the surface of the printing blanket. A continuous 
paper web or sheet stock to be printed is then passed between the 
blanket- covered cylinder and a rigid back-up cylinder to transfer 
the image from the surface of the printing blanket to the paper. The blanket-covered cylinders have to accommodate a mechanism to 
hold the printing blanket on the cylinder surface. This mechanism 
is typically located in a gap extending axially or longitudinally 
along the cylinder. Typically, these gaps will have a 
circumferential distance (width) of at least 4.5 mm (0.18 inches). 
As a result, for every revolution of the blanket-covered cylinder, 
that portion of the web which passes the printing cylinder gap is 
not imprinted. This results in an increase in operating costs 
which may be attributed to several factors including the need for 
printing cylinders having larger diameters to achieve the desired 
page length and the wasted paper produced from such gaps.  
 
Moreover, the cylinders in a typical offset printing 
apparatus rotate at high speeds and with substantial 
pressure between the cylinders, thereby providing a 
structural environment in which the gaps cause shock and 
vibrations degrading the printing quality and 
contributing to printing apparatus wear. In addition, 
the gaps destroy the symmetry of the cylinders which is 
an undesirable condition for high speed rotation. As a 
result, the rotational speed of the blanket-covered 
cylinders must be limited. Accordingly, it would be 
desirable to have printing apparatus which provide a 
narrow gap on the blanket-covered cylinder. In response to such problems, cylinders to 
which a printing blanket is held magnetically have

84, 104, 123, 136, 156) having first (11, 54, 76, 94, 101, 141) and 

second (13, 56, 78, 96, 103, 143) edges extending longitudinally 
along an outer surface of said printing cylinder and said printing 

blanket including a magnetic backing ply (20, 48, 70, 88, 108, 124, 
144) for magnetically adhering said printing blanket to the outer 

surface of said printing cylinder, wherein said
