<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to air duct apparatus for use in 
conjunction with air supply fan units, particularly such units 
designed for buildings or other large structures. It is well known to provide an air supply system for a 
building, which system includes a main air supply duct, branch 
supply ducts and a fan unit. Often an air conditioning unit 
will form part of this system in order to cool the air that is 
being forced through the ducts. A problem often encountered 
with such systems is that the fan unit can produce a 
substantial noise and this noise can be carried through the 
ductwork and thereby be heard by persons in the building or 
structure. Not only is this a problem downstream of the fan 
unit, but it can also be a problem, at least in the immediate 
vicinity of the fan unit, on the upstream side since sound can 
travel out through the passageways that feed air to the fan 
unit. The noise created by the large fans in these systems is 
a particular problem in those buildings which must or should 
be kept reasonably quite, for example in hospitals and other 
buildings where the occupants are sleeping on a regular basis. In addition to providing some noise attenuation, an air 
duct structure located downstream from a fan unit often is 
required to deliver the airflow from the fan to one or more 
air filters or perhaps to an air conditioning unit. In such 
cases it can be important for the air stream provided at the 
outlet of the duct structure to be relatively uniform across 
the width and height of the outlet. In this way, the amount 
of air flowing through each filter or each section of the 
filter, would be approximately the same.  In the construction of the duct structure located 
immediately downstream from a fan unit, it can be advantageous 
if the size of the air flow passageway is gradually increased 
from the inlet to the outlet of the duct structure. By 
increasing the size of the passageway in this manner, the air 
flowing through the passageway is allowed to expand gradually, 
thus permitting the velocity energy of the air to be 
recovered. As a result, the static pressure of the airflow is 
thereby increased. A gradual expansion of the size of the 
passageway is important in order to obtain maximum regain of 
air velocity pressure. By constructing the outlet duct 
structure in this manner, one could use a smaller size of fan 
motor to supply the same size of building than would otherwise 
be the case. Another requirement of the duct structure located 
downstream from an air
