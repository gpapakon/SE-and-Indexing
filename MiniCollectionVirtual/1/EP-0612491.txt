<ABSTRACT>
A presentation stand for tiles has a row of vertical shafts (8), from each of which project forwards and parallel a lower (9) and an upper arm, between the ends of which a panel (11) covered with tiles is rotatably held, it being possible for the pivotable units formed from the two arms (9) and the panel (11) with the said shaft (8), in the basic position of the panel (11) in alignment with the arms (9), to be turned over in the manner of a page of a book and for a panel (11) which is to be viewed to be turned in the free space between the other units which have been turned over obliquely towards the sides. On turning the panel (11) out of the basic position, the pivotable unit in question is locked (26, 27) towards the front in the middle position and on pivoting the unit towards the side, the basic position of the panel (11) is locked. For this purpose, a locking bar (27) which extends between the shaft (8) and a pivot (29) of the panel (11) and can be pushed to and fro is provided.
