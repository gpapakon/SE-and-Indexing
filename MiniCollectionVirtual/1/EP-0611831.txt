<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a titanium-base alloy having a 
combination of high strength and toughness. Titanium base alloys are known for use in various structural 
applications where the strength-to-weight ratio of titanium 
is required. Specifically, there are applications for titanium 
base alloys wherein the alloy in plate form is fabricated to 
produce structures, including marine structures, that are subjected 
to cyclical high-pressure application, such as in the 
construction of pressure vessels and submarine hulls. In these 
applications, it is important that the alloy have a combination 
of high strength and toughness, particularly fracture toughness. 
Specifically, in this regard, it is important that the alloy 
exhibit a resistance to failure by crack initiation and propagation 
in the presence of a defect when the structure embodying 
the alloy is subjected to high-pressure application. Moreover, 
it is important that the alloy exhibit high strength and 
toughness in both the welded and unwelded condition, because 
structures of this type are fabricated by welding. In marine 
applications it is also necessary that the alloy exhibit a high 
degree of resistance to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in an 
aqueous 3.5% Nacl solution.  
 A welding wire of titanium alloy is disclosed in Russian patent number SU 
436717. The alloy composition consists of (wt %) Al 4.7-5.8; Zr 2.2-3.5; 
V 1.3-3.2; Mo 0.8-1.5; Sn 1-2; remainder Ti. Welds from this wire 
have improved strength and thermal stability. A titanium alloy having improved mechanical properties is disclosed in 
Russian patent number SU 447450. The alloy consists of (wt %) Al 2-6; 
Mo 1.0-3.8; V 0.7-2.5; oxygen 0.05-0.015 (sic); hydrogen 0.005-0.015; 
remainder Ti. Another titanium based alloy for use in welding is disclosed in Chemical 
Abstracts 96(6): 39354a, the composition being described in RN=80264-38-6 
and comprising 93% Ti, 4.5% Al, 1.7% V and 0.8% Mo. Other titanium base alloys having the combination of properties required 
for cyclical high-pressure application are known in the art. These 
conventional alloys, however, to  
 
achieve the desired combination of high strength and toughness 
require relatively high contents of niobium and/or tantalum. 
These are expensive alloying additions and add considerably to 
the cost of the alloy. Figure 1 is a graph showing the effect of oxygen content on 
yield strength (YS) for the alloy Ti-5Al-2Zr-2V-0.5Mo; Figure 2 is a graph showing the effect of oxygen content on 
energy toughness (W/A)
