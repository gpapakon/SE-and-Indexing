<ABSTRACT>
A wiring board for electrical tests; comprising an 
insulating substrate (4 and 5 in Fig. 1), wiring of 

predetermined pattern (2) which is embedded in the 
insulating substrate (4, 5), and bump electrodes (1) which 

are formed on the wiring (2) and which are respectively 
brought into contact with corresponding electrodes of an 

article to-be-tested. Thus, even when the electrode pitch 
of the article to-be-tested such as a semiconductor device 

has become smaller (for example, less than 0.1 [mm]), the 

electrodes (1) can be formed so as to cope with the 
electrical tests of the article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wiring board for 
electrical tests, and a method of manufacturing the same, see e.g. EP-A-0 529 577. 
By way of example, the electrical tests include the 
insulation and connection tests of high-density wiring in a 
printed-wiring circuit board, a circuit board for an 
integrated circuit or a circuit board for a liquid-crystal 
display, and the ON-resistance tests of a semiconductor 
device. As semiconductor devices have been subjected to 
increased density of integration and density of surface 
packaging, the tests of the devices and the packaging 
circuit boards thereof have become very difficult. In the case of the semiconductor devices, several tens 
âˆ¼ several hundred of electrodes are laid out on silicon 
chips of several millimeters square. Further, a 
semiconductor device having more than one thousand 
electrodes will be developed. The tests of such devices 
are extremely difficult. Especially, it is difficult to  
 
test a so-called "bare chip" which is a silicon chip before 
being packaged (namely, before being mounted on a lead 
frame and encapsulated with a resin). Granted that the 
tests of the bare chip are possible, they are not commonly 
applied because of complicated test jigs and heavy test 
expenses. On the other hand, also in the case of the wiring 
circuit boards for use in the packaging, the 
microfabrication of wiring has been promoted. It has been 
required of the wiring circuit boards to have wiring leads 
at a pitch of or below 0.1 [mm] and electrodes at a pitch 
of or below 0.1 [mm] (equal to the electrode pitch of the 
semiconductor devices). Such wiring circuit boards cannot 
be tested with regard to insulation and connection by a 
conventional method which permits the electrodes to be 
temporarily connected and disconnected, for example, a 
method in which anisotropic conductive rubber is brought 
into pressed touch with the electrodes as disclosed in the 
official gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No. 3269/1984. In view of the circumstances stated above, the present 
invention has for its object to provide a wiring board for 
electrical tests which facilitates the tests of a  
 
semiconductor device, a wiring circuit board or the like 
(hereinbelow, sometimes termed an "article to-be-tested"). Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a method of manufacture which is well suited to the 
aforementioned wiring board for electrical tests. A wiring board for electrical tests according to the 
present invention
