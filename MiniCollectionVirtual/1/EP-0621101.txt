<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for soldering a workpiece in a non-oxidizing 
gas atmosphere and more particularly to a method and an 
apparatus for soldering and workpiece in non-oxidizing 
gas atmosphere with little consumption of a non-oxidizing 
gas. In a conventional flow soldering method, freon has 
been used to wash off flux residue from a workpiece 
such as a printed circuit board after the workpiece had 
been soldered. In order not to use freon which causes 
an atmospheric pollution, however, attempts have been 
made to eliminate the washing step from the soldering 
process. One of such attempts is that soldering is 
performed by using flux including less solid content 
and fewer activators than the conventional flux. 
However, this method encounters a problem that the 
lowering of the flux concentration leads to poor 
solderability. After industrious investigation, the inventor of 
this invention found that flux residue is reduced so 
much that it is unnecessary to be washed off when 
soldering is performed in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. 
Based on this, he has developed an effective method and 
apparatus in which the whole soldering apparatus is 
enclosed by a chamber or the solder bath is surrounded 
by an enclosure, and non-oxidizing gas such as N₂ gas 
or an inert gas is introduced into the chamber or the 
enclosure to form a non-oxidizing atmosphere therein. However, the formation of the non-oxidizing 
atmosphere in the chamber leads to high initial and 
running costs. On the other hand, it is difficult to 
lower oxygen concentration in the non-oxidizing 
atmosphere in the enclosure around the solder bath,  
 
failing to obtain good solderability. As a result of further investigation, the inventor 
of this invention has arrived at the conclusion that it 
is enough to make the parting portion of the workpiece 
and its vicinity be in a non-oxidizing state without 
employing the above-mentioned chamber or enclosure, in 
order to solder the workpiece without accompanying 
washing step. It is accordingly the object of this invention to 
provide a method and apparatus for soldering a 
workpiece in a non-oxidizing atmosphere, in which a 
non-oxidizing gas is jetted into a region defined by 
the parting portion of a workpiece separated from 
solder in a solder bath and a vicinity thereof. In order to achieve the object, one aspect of this 
invention provides a method for soldering a workpiece 
in a non-oxidizing atmosphere, which comprises the 
steps of moving a workpiece in a
