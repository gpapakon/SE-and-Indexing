<ABSTRACT>
A pivot/tilt fitting for windows, doors or the like is provided with an edge gearing mechanism (6) which is fitted on the sash frame (4) and exhibits locking pins (7, 8) which can be moved into three different adjustment positions, namely for closing and pivoting open and tilting opening the sash, and with a plurality of closure pieces (9), arranged on the window frame (1), and a tilt-bearing closure piece (10) which is arranged on the lower transverse member (1') of the window frame and exhibits two closure pockets (12, 12') which, in the closed position and tilt-open position of the edge gearing mechanism (6), can be brought into engagement with a locking pin. In order to produce the pivot/tilt fitting in a substantially simpler manner in terms of its closure pieces, interacting with the locking pins of the edge gearing mechanism, and, in particular, also in terms of its lower tilt bearing and to permit even further improved tilt-opening securing of the sash, the two closure pockets (12, 12') in the tilt-bearing closure piece (10) are open towards the two ends thereof and, on the edge gearing mechanism (6) there are provided two locking pins (8, 8') which interact therewith and of which one (8), in the tilt position (K) of the gearing mechanism (6), is introduced into one closure pocket (12) and the other (8'), in the closed position (V) of the gearing mechanism, is introduced into the other closure pocket (12').

Fitting for rotatable and tiltable windows, doors or the like, comprising a marginal 
transmission (6) located on the frame (4) of the closure and including locking pins 

which can be brought into three different setting positions, namely for the closing, 
rotational opening and tilt opening of the closure, as well as a plurality of fastening 

members (9) arranged on the window frame (1), and a pivot bearing fastening 
member (10) which is arranged on the bottom transverse spar (1') of the window 

frame and which has a fastening pocket for the insertion of two locking pins (8, 8') 
which are provided on the marginal transmission and which cooperate therewith in 

dependence upon the position of the marginal transmission, 
characterised in that
 
two fastening pockets (12, 12') are provided which are to be brought into engagement 

with a respective one of the two locking pins in the closed and tilted open position of 
the marginal transmission (6), and which fastening pockets in the pivot bearing 

fastening member (10) are open towards its two ends, wherein one (8) of the locking 
pins enters the one fastening pocket (12) in the tilted position (K) of the transmission 

(6) and the other pin (8') enters the other fastening pocket (12') in the closed position 
(V) of the transmission, and that each of the two locking pins (8, 8') in its insertion 

position is in fastening engagement with its locking pocket and the locking pin (8) 
remains in fastening engagement for the tilt position even when the window closure 

is in the tilted open position, wherein the respective fastening engagement is 
achieved by the fact that both locking pins (8, 8') have a respective mushroomshaped 

head, each of which in the fastening state has its respective insertion opening 
in the pivot bearing fastening member (10) engaged over it. 
Fitting for rotatable and tiltable windows, doors or the like as claimed in claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the pivot bearing fastening member (10) consists of a bearing 
socket (14) profiled to correspond on the underside with the profiled contact surface 

(13') of the window frame (13), and a masking rail (15) connected fixedly thereto and 
engaging over the bearing socket (14) to form the locking pockets (12, 12'), said 

masking rail being provided with an angled fixing flange (15') next to the bearing 
socket (14) and with screw-fastening holes (15") provided therein. 
Rotatable and tiltable fitting as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the  
 

pivot bearing fastening member (10) is symmetrical for selective use as a right-hand 
or left-hand stop in relation to its longitudinal centre (M). 
Fitting for rotatable and tiltable windows, doors or the like as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 for window closures (4) provided with a 
marginal transmission (6) running all round them, identical fastening members (9, 

10) are mounted on all four spars (1, 1", 1''', 1'''') of the window frame (1).
