<ABSTRACT>
A storage and thermally stable polymer suspension in 
fresh water remains pourable after mixing at 6 months 

comprises at least 30% ammonium or sodium thiosulfate and 
20% hydroxyethylcellulose. In an oil drilling fluid, 

yield value decreases less than 35% when heated for 16 
hours at 250°F.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to aqueous salt suspension of
polymer. In particular the invention relates to a thermally,
stable suspension of hydroxyethylcellulose in ammonium or
sodium thiosulfate.Fluidized polymer suspensions which employ an inorganic
salt are known from U.S. patents 4,283,229, 4,883,536 and
4,883,537. These salts include alkali metal and ammonium ion
carbonates, phosphates and sulfates. EP-A 482533, US-A
5,228,908 and US-A 5,228,909 employ sodium formate as the
suspending salt.BE-A 447 906 is directed to molding materials comprising
cellulose ethers. This document discloses that the presence of
some sulfur containing compounds such as sodium hyposulfite
avoids the discoloration of cellulose ethers during the
molding of such materials under pressure and at high
temperature.US-A 5,028,263 discloses stable aqueous suspensions of
water-soluble polymers comprising a water-soluble polymer
dispersed in an aqueous solution of an ammonium salt having a
multivalent anion. Some of the water-soluble polymers used in
this document such as hydroxyethylcellulose are difficult to
incorporate into an aqueous system and therefore it is
suggested to apply the water-soluble polymer in form of an
aqueous suspension. Such an aqueous suspension is said to be
stable and can comprise a high amount of water-soluble
polymer, if it comprises a specific ammonium salt.It is an object of the invention to provide thermal and
storage stable aqueous suspensions of hydroxyethylcellulose
containing at least 30% by weight ammonium or sodium
thiosulfate. The suspensions are prepared by dissolving the ammonium
or sodium thiosulfates in water and dispersing the
hydroxyethylcellulose into the solution.The suspensions are prepared with fresh water and remain
pourable after mild stirring for six months.It has been discovered that hydroxyethylcellulose (well
known as a nonionic thickening agent) can be protected against
thermal degradation by thiosulfate salts. Hydroxyethylcellulose
is available from the Aqualon Company as Natrosol®
hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC). Grade HHXR is of high molecular
weight. Grade EXR is low 
molecular weight. HEC is also available from Union
Carbide and Daicel. HEC is widely used as a paint
thickener and for other applications in food, cosmetics
and pharmaceuticals.Ammonium thiosulfate is a commodity chemical which is
generally believed to be interchangeable with sodium
thiosulfate. For example in photographic processing,
"fixer" is usually sodium thiosulfate, while ammonium
thiosulfate can also be
