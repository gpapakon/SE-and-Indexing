<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on the design and arrangement of the antenna (20) in consumption breakdown meters, especially heating-cost and hot-water-cost breakdown meters which are read centrally in a meter located outside dwellings, the measurement data being transmitted by means of a wire-free link operating in the UHF band and being transmitted between the consumption breakdown meter and a central receiving point. The consumption breakdown meter, especially the heating-cost breakdown meter, is an autonomous measurement point which can electronically store the consumption detected and can also display it directly. The antenna (20) is arranged either inside the housing (1, 21) of the consumption breakdown meter or directly on it, so that there is no need for special laying of an antenna (20) at the installation site of the load breakdown meter. Instead of this, this antenna is a permanent component of the consumption breakdown meter, especially of the heating-cost breakdown meter. Various types of design (shape) and arrangement of the antenna (20) are disclosed, in or on the housing (1, 21).
