<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a device for guiding and transferring at least two sheet-metal blanks (2, 3) brought together beforehand, edge to edge, in order to form a joint plane (4), into an installation for continuously welding by means of a laser beam (1). The device includes two assemblies (20, 60) for supporting and transferring the sheet-metal blanks (2, 3), each of which is formed by a lower articulated-block chain (21a, 61a) and by an upper articulated-block chain (21b, 61b) arranged opposite the corresponding lower articulated-block chain, at least one of the two supporting and transferring assemblies (20, 60) being oriented towards the joint plane (4) in the direction for transferring the sheet-metal blanks (2, 3) in order to exert a lateral pressure on the said sheet-metal blanks (2, 3) against each other and in the direction of their edges to be welded. The subject of the invention is also a welding installation which includes such a device for guiding and transferring at least two sheet-metal blanks.

A device for guiding and transferring at least two metal 
sheets (2, 3), previously placed edge-to-edge to form a 

joining plane (4), in a continuous welding installation

(20, 60) for supporting and transferring the metal sheets 
(2, 3) in the direction of the laser beam (1), arranged on 

either side of the joining plane (4) and movable in 
synchronisation with one another, each supporting and 

transferring assembly (20, 60) being formed, on the one 
hand, by a lower chain (21a, 61a) having articulated plates 

constituting a substantially continuous contact surface with 
the lower face of the corresponding metal sheets (2, 3) and, 

on the other hand, an upper chain (21b, 61b) having 
articulated plates arranged facing the corresponding lower 

chain (21a, 61a) having articulated plates and intended to 
cooperate with the latter in order to move the metal sheets 

(2, 3) by static friction in the direction of the laser beam 
(1), characterized in that at least one of the two 

supporting and transferring assemblies (20, 60) is oriented 
obliquely in the direction of the joining plane (4) in the

exert a lateral pressure on the metal sheets (2, 3), one 

against the other and in the direction of their edges to be 
welded. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that one of 
the two supporting and transferring assemblies (20, 60) is 

oriented in the direction of the joining plane (4) in the

assembly (20, 60) is parallel to the joining plane (4) of 
the metal sheets (2, 3). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that each of 
the two supporting and transferring assemblies (20, 60) is  

 
oriented in the direction of the joining plane (4) of the

A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that each supporting and transferring assembly (20, 60) is 

equipped with means (26, 27, 66, 67) of flanging the metal 
sheets (2, 3) under a vertical force acting on the chains 

(21a, 21b, 61a, 61b) having articulated plates of the 
corresponding assembly. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
flanging means are formed by rollers (26, 66) supporting the 

corresponding lower chain (21a, 61a) having articulated 
plates, the axis of rotation of the rollers (26, 66) being 

perpendicular to the direction of movement of the lower 
chain (21a, 61a) having articulated plates and horizontal, 

and by supporting rollers (27, 67) for the corresponding 
upper chain (21b, 61b) having articulated plates, the axis 

of rotation of the rollers (27, 67) being perpendicular to 
the direction of movement of the corresponding upper chain 

(21b, 61b) having articulated plates and horizontal. 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that at 
least three rollers (26, 27, 66, 67) are simultaneously in 

contact with a plate (24a, 24b, 64a, 64b) of each chain 
(21a, 21b, 61a, 61b) having articulated plates. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that each chain (21a, 21b, 61a, 61b) having 

articulated plates forms a loop in a plane perpendicular to

rotation.
