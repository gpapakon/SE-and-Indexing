<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a soldering device 
comprising: 
a soldering chamber; soldering means for soldering the objects for 
soldering present in the chamber; a transporting device present in the chamber for 
transporting the objects for soldering; at least one filter unit for cleaning the gases 
present in the chamber, which filter unit is connected to 
the chamber with a feed line for feeding contaminated gas 
to the filter and a discharge line; and a fan arranged in one of the lines.   Such a soldering device is known from US-A-4951401. The filter used in this known soldering device serves 
to remove waste products from the gases present in the 
soldering chamber. These waste products occur as a 
consequence of the soldering process taking place in the 
soldering chamber, for instance as a result of the reflow-soldering 
process, wherein the solder paste comprises 
substances which evaporate on heating. Waste products can 
further occur for instance due to evaporation of the 
fluxes used during the normal soldering using a solder 
wave. These waste products are present in the soldering 
chamber mainly in gaseous form. When these gases are 
passed through the filter they will scarcely be restrained 
by the filter, so that the greater part of these waste 
products is fed back again to the soldering chamber and 
the filter has hardly any effect. The object of the present invention is to provide 
such a soldering device wherein the filter is effective. This object is achieved with a soldering device of the kind 
mentioned above, characterized in that a cooling device is 
arranged in the feed line. As a result of this step the gases flowing through 
the filter have a lower temperature so that condensation 
of the harmful substances can occur and these remain 
behind in the  
 
filter. The effectiveness of the filter is thus increased. According to a preferred embodiment the cooling device is 
combined with the cleaning device into one unit. It will be apparent that, when cooling and cleaning take 
place inside the same unit, the effectiveness of the cleaning is 
greatest; precisely at the position where they are removed the 
harmful substances are cooled in order to cause condensation. 
Condensation therefore occurs at the location where the 
separation of the liquid substances takes place most effectively. According to a second preferred embodiment the unit is 
adapted for stepwise alternating cooling of the gas and cleaning 
thereof by means of filters. This step also results in an 
improved
