<ABSTRACT>
In a method for forming a duplicate image by 
reading an original image from an original sheet and 

forming a duplicate image according to the original 
image, to allow the designation of a number of regions 

for forming duplicate regional images, from an overall 
image, with desired color separation or other various 

attributes to be carried out accurately, promptly and 
simply by mounting the original sheet only once on a 

digitizer or the like without regard to the number of 
processes of forming a duplicate image, a plurality of 

regions designated on a single original sheet are 
stored in a storage device such as computer memory, 

either the designated region stored in the storage 
device or the region other than the designated region 

is defined as an effective region, a duplicate image of 
only the effective region is formed for a first process 

of forming a duplicate image, only the region other 
than the effective region for the first process of 

forming a duplicate image is defined as a new effective 
region, and a duplicate image only for this new 

effective region is formed for the second process of 
forming a duplicate image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for forming a copy image, and
in particular to a method and a device for forming a copy image suitable for use in stencil
plate making/printing device which is capable of multi-color printing among other
possibilities.In a duplicate image forming device for reading an
original image from an original sheet, and forming a
duplicate image according to the original image, such
as an electrographic copying device and a thermal
stencil master plate making/printing device,
conventionally, a plurality of duplicate images or
duplicate stencil master plates are formed or prepared
from a single original sheet for two-color or multi-color
copying and stencil printing.For instance, when only a part of the original
image on an original sheet is to be stencil printed in
a different color, two stencil master plates are
prepared, one of them including only a designated
region of the original image that is to be printed in
one color while the other stencil master plate covers
the remaining part of the original image that is to be
printed in another color, and the two stencil master
plates are used one after the other using inks of two
different colors on a same sheet of printing paper.In the case of preparing a duplicate stencil
master plate, a duplicate stencil master plate may be
prepared for each of a plurality of original sheets
each covering a different region of an original image,
but it means a substantial complication in the
preparation of the original sheets because the same 
number of original sheets as the number of necessary
colors are required.It is known to designate a region of an original
image that is to be extracted from the original image
or an ineffective region of the original image that is
to be discarded by using a coordinate input device such
as a digitizer, and to carry out the process of
preparing a stencil master plate only with respect to
the effective region which may be either the designated
region or the area other than the designated region.
In this case, all that is needed is a single original
sheet which includes all of the original image to be
printed, and there is no need to prepare a same number
of original sheets as the number of colors, see, for exemple, US-A-4 896 208.However, even when a digitizer is used, a region
of the original image that is to be extracted or a
region of the original image that is to be made
ineffective must be designated with the coordinate
input means each time a stencil master plate is to be
prepared,
