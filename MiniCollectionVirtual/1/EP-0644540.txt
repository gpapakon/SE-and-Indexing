<ABSTRACT>
An eject mechanism of a recording and/or reproducing apparatus 
using a cartridge accommodating a recording medium, such as a disc 

cartridge includes a cartridge holder (47), an eject lever (58) and a 
lock mechanism. The cartridge holder (47) is attached to a base member 

(41) so as to become rotatable between a first position and a second 
position lower than the first position. The cartridge holder (47) 

loads thereunto the cartridge (101) and holds the inserted cartridge. 
The eject lever (58) is attached to the cartridge holder (47) so that 

it can be freely moved. The eject lever (58) is engaged with the 
cartridge (101) inserted into the cartridge holder and moved in unison 

with the inserted cartridge. The lock mechanism restricts the eject 
lever (58) from moving in a disc cartridge eject direction under the 

condition that insertion of the cartridge into the cartridge holder is 
finished and releases a restricted movement of the eject lever (58) in 

the disc cartridge eject direction when the cartridge holder (47) is 
rotated from the second position to the first position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus using a cartridge in which a recording
medium is accommodated and an eject mechanism thereof.The recording and/or reproducing apparatus
can use a cartridge accommodating a
recording medium having a holder for holding an inserted
cartridge and an eject mechanism thereof.Disc players having a disc cartridge in which an optical
disc is accommodated as a recording medium, for example, loaded
thereon to reproduce and/or record the disc are roughly
classified as two kinds of systems, i.e., one system in which a
disc player body has an openable and closable lid through which
a disc cartridge is loaded and/or ejected and another system
called a front loading system in which a disc cartridge is
loaded onto and/or ejected from an insertion mouth formed on the
front wall of the disc player body.Of various types of disc players, portable small and
thin disc players adopt the former system to load and/or eject
the disc cartridge by opening and/or closing the openable and
closable lid in order to simplify its mechanism.If the portable disc players of the above-mentioned 
system are designed so as to eject the disc cartridge, then it becomes
very convenient for the user to take the disc cartridge from the disc
player body with ease. However, the portable disc players are too
small to afford a sufficient space in which the eject mechanism is
provided. On the other hand, the disc players of front loading system
are adapted to eject the disc cartridge by electric driving power.
Such front loading system, however. cannot be applied to the portable
disc players.For this reason, it is not easy for the user to eject the disc
cartridge from the portable disc player and the portable disc players
are not easy to handle.European Patent Specification No. 0547944 is used for the delimitation of claim 1 and discloses a
recording/reproducing apparatus having a disk cartridge eject mechanism
that comprises an arm which is pivotable to sweep out an area of the
plane defined by the major surface of the cartridge inserted in the
apparatus. Locking means, and means to release the locking means, are
provided. According to the invention, there is provided a
recording and/or reproducing apparatus comprising:
a base member;a cartridge holder mounted on said base member for rotation
between an open position and a closed position. the cartridge holder
having a slot-like opening through which a cartridge having a recording
medium accommodated therein may be inserted and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus (1)
comprising:


a base member (41);
a cartridge holder (47) mounted on said base member (41) for
rotation between an open position and a closed position, the cartridge

holder (47) having a slot-like opening through which a cartridge (101)
having a recording medium (100) accommodated therein may be inserted

and ejected; and

   an eject mechanism comprising:

an eject operation member (58) movably attached to said cartridge
holder (47) for ejecting said cartridge (101) as said cartridge holder

(47) is moved to said open position; and
a lock mechanism (67,72) engageable with said eject operation
member (58) to lock said eject operation member (58) when said

cartridge (101) has been inserted into said holder (47);

   the eject mechanism being characterised in that:

said eject operation member (58) is attached to a side wall (47c)
of said cartridge holder (47) and is engageable with a cartridge (101)

inserted in said holder (47) for reciprocal linear movement therewith.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said lock
mechanism (67,72) comprises a lock member (67) engageable with said

eject operation member (58) to prevent ejection of a cartridge inserted
in said apparatus, and a releasing member (72) for releasing said eject

operation member (58) from engagement with said lock member (67) as 
said cartridge holder (47) is rotated from said closed position to said

open position.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said lock member
(67) is rotatably attached to a side (47c) of said cartridge holder

(47) to which the eject operation member (58) is attached, and wherein
said lock member (67) is formed with an engagement formation (67a)

engageable with said eject operation member (58).
An apparatus according to claim 3, wherein said lock member
(67) is biased into engagement with said eject operation member (58) by

a spring-biasing member (69).
An apparatus according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein
said releasing member (72) is rotatably attached to said base member

(41), and wherein said releasing member (72) includes an engagement
portion (72a) enagageable with said lock member in said closed

position.
An apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said
eject operation member (58) includes an engaging projection (62) which

is engageable with a concave portion (103) of a cartridge (101)
inserted into said cartridge holder (47).
An apparatus according to claim 6, wherein said eject
operation member (58) comprises a base portion (58a) attached to said

cartridge holder (47), and an arm portion (58b) integrally formed with
said base portion (58a) and having said engaging projection (62) 

provided on a free end side thereof.
An apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, wherein said
engaging projection (62) includes an undercut portion (62a) that is

engageable with said concave portion (103) of said disc cartridge
(101).
An apparatus according to any preceding claim, comprising
a spring-biasing member (61) for biasing said eject operation member

(58) to eject a disc cartridge (101) from said cartridge holder (47).
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein said cart
ridge holder (47) includes a major wall portion (47a)
