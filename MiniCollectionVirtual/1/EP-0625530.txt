<ABSTRACT>
Polyglycidyl epoxy resins are modified to have a 

blocked isocyanate moiety bound to the resin backbone 
through an oxazolidone ring by reacting the epoxy resin with 

an asymmetrically blocked diisocyanate. Further reaction 
with a cationic active hydrogen compound gives a modified 

epoxy resin having a cationic group in addition to the 
blocked isocyanate moieties. The modified epoxy resins are 

incorporated into cathodic electrodeposition paint as a 
crosslinker or cationic binder resin or pigment dispersing 

agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oxazolidone ring-containing 
modified epoxy resins. The invention also relates to cathodic electrodeposition 
paints containing said modified epoxy resins. Modified epoxy resins to be formulated in cathodic 
electrodeposition paints are conventionally produced by 
reacting an epoxy resin with a first active hydrogen 
compound such as alkyl phenols, monocarboxylic acids or 
hydroxycarboxylic acids to open a portion of the epoxide 
rings, and then with a second active hydrogen compound such 
as primary or secondary amines to open the remaining epoxide 
rings. The resulting modified resins are combined with a 
crosslinker such as melamine resins or blocked organic 
polyisocyanates, applied electrically onto a substrate, and 
baked at an elevated temperature to give a cured film. 
Modified epoxy resins of this type have certain 
disadvantages in that they react with the crosslinker only 
at relatively high temperatures. It is also known to make 
the modified epoxy resins self-crosslinkable by attaching a 
half blocked diisocyanate to a secondary alcoholic hydroxyl  
 
group formed by the ring-opening reaction of the epoxy 
ring. This resin also suffers from certain disadvantages in 
that the blocked isocyanate moiety bound through the 
urethane linkage tends to be liberated at least partially 
when the film is baked at a temperature above 200°C. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,276,072 discloses a 
hydrophilic resin having an oxasolidone ring-containing 
backbone and an ionizable group at the terminals of the 
backbone. The resin backbone is produced by reacting an 
organic diisocyanate and an epoxy resin at an 
epoxy/isocyanate equivalent ratio greater than 1 so that 
all of the isocyanato groups are converted to the 
oxasolidone rings. We have now found that by reversing the 
epoxy/isocyanate equivalent ratio, it is possible to 
produce an epoxy resin-diisocyanate adduct in which only one 
isocyanato group has been converted to the oxazolidone ring 
and the other isocyanato group has been reversibly blocked 
or otherwise modified in a useful manner. In one aspect, the present invention provides a 
modified epoxy resin having bound thereto a plurality of 
blocked isocyanate moieties through an oxazolidone ring 
formed by the reaction between at least a portion of the 
epoxy rings of a polyglycidyl epoxy resin and one  
 
isocyanato group of an organic diisocyanate, the other 
isocyanato group thereof being reversibly blocked. This 
modified epoxy resin may be incorporated to
