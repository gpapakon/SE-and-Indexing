<ABSTRACT>
Hemoglobin for forming the basis of blood substitute is modified by crosslinking it by reaction with a polyaldehyde produced by ring opening oxidation of a di/tri-saccharide such as raffinose, wherein the o-saccharide solutions are maintained and the reaction is conducted at a pH from about 5.0 - 7.0, and at a stoichiometry from about 1:1 - 4:1 based upon the molar ratio of di/tri-saccharide to hemoglobin tetramers, followed by appropriate reduction of the Schiff base linkages so formed to stabilize them. Careful control of the pH of ring opening to the di/tri-saccharide ensures consistent production of the polyaldehyde without unwanted side products and reaction of this product with the hemoglobin at the specified stoichiometry leads to high yields of stabilized, tetrameric hemoglobin and oligomers thereof of predetermined composition and beneficial properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blood substitutes and 
processes for their preparation. More specifically, it 
relates to blood substitutes based on hemoglobin, and 
processes for the chemical modification of hemoglobin to 
improve its suitability for use as the basis of a blood 
substitute. Hemoglobin, as the natural oxygen transporter 
component of blood, is an obvious candidate to form the 
basis of a blood substitute, e.g. as an aqueous solution. 
Extensive scientific work has been done and reported, on 
attempts to provide a satisfactory hemoglobin solution to 
act as a blood substitute. The chemical properties of 
hemoglobin outside the red blood cells are, however, 
markedly different from its properties inside the red blood 
cells, e.g. as regards its oxygen affinity. The need for 
some form of chemical modification of hemoglobin to render 
it suitable for use as a blood substitute has long been 
recognized and has been quite extensively investigated. It is well known that hemoglobin comprises a 
tetramer of four sub-units, namely two α sub-units each 
having a globin peptide chain and two β sub-units each 
having a globin peptide chain. The tetramer has a molecular 
weight of approximately 64 kilodaltons, and each subunit 
has approximately the same molecular weight. The 
tetrameric hemoglobin in dilute aqueous solution readily 
dissociates into α-β dimers, and even further under some 
conditions to α-sub-unit monomers and β-sub-unit monomers. 
The dimers and monomers have too low a molecular weight for 
retention in the circulatory system of the body, and are 
filtered by the kidneys for excretion with the urine. This  
 
results in an unacceptably short half life of such a 
product in the body. Moreover, uncrosslinked hemoglobin 
induces significant nephrotoxicity, so that there is need 
to minimize the concentration of uncrosslinked hemoglobin 
in the products. The need for chemical bonding between the 
sub-units to ensure the maintenance of the tetrameric form 
("intramolecular crosslinking") has previously been recognized. 
Also, the linking together of two or more tetrameric 
units to form hemoglobin oligomers and polymers of 
molecular weight greater than 64 kilodaltons ("intermolecular 
crosslinking") has also been recognized as 
desirable in many instances. When present in the red blood cells, hemoglobin 
is bound to a natural ligand, diphosphoglycerate (DPG) at 
a particular site in the hemoglobin molecule known as the 
DPG cleft or pocket. When the red blood cell membrane is 
removed, the

A process of chemically modifying hemoglobin to 
render it more suitable for use as the oxygen transporter 

in a blood substitute in aqueous solution, which comprises: 

(a) subjecting a di/tri-saccharide to an oxidative 
ring opening process to produce a 

polyaldehyde therefrom; 
(b) adjusting and maintaining the pH of the 
resulting product solutions to a value in 

the range from about 5.0 - 7.0, so as to 
prevent any substantial hydrolytic degradation 

of the polyaldehyde so formed; 
(c) reacting the product of process step (b) 
with hemoglobin in solution, at a 

stoichiometric ratio based upon di/tri-saccharide 
and hemoglobin tetramers, of from 

about 1:1 - 4:1; 
(d) reducing the Schiff base linkages so formed 
to secondary amine linkages; and 
(e) recovering the modified hemoglobin so 
formed.

is a trisaccharide

is raffinose. 
The process of claim 3 wherein the hemoglobin is 
deoxyhemoglobin.  

 
The process of claim 4 including the initial step 
of deoxygenating the hemoglobin by subjection to inert gas 

under conditions sufficient to effect substantially complete 
deoxygenation thereof, in the absence of effective 

amounts of reducing agents.

is substantially entirely free from sodium dithionite 

and residues thereof. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the hemoglobin is 
human hemoglobin.

initially in the T-configuration and is stabilized into 

said T-configuration by reaction with the poly-aldehyde.

opening of the raffinose is effected by reaction with 

sodium periodate or potassium periodate, under highly 
acidic conditions. 
The process of claim 9 wherein the reaction 
product solution is subsequently buffered to a pH 5.0 - 7.0 

by use of a phosphate free buffer, and maintained within 
said pH range for subsequent use.

bis-tris buffer system.

stoichiometry of the di/tri-saccharide to the hemoglobin
