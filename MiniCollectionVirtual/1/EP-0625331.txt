<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electric vacuum cleaner 
which can generate from within the cleaner and eject high 

temperature steam to curable stains smeared into a floor, 
old stains and the like to be removed easily, so that 

cleaning effectiveness is improved and sterilizing achieved. 
A vacuum cleaner comprises water supply means (30) disposed 

in the body (10) of the cleaner for storing a predetermined 
quantity of water (W) therein; steam generating means 

(21,27) for generating steam by heating water (W) supplied 
from the water supply means (30); dust collecting means (52) 

for separating dust from waste water according to the 
operation of the driving means (40) to thereafter collect 

the same; and a suction head (60) having a suction port (61) 
for being assembled in the body (10) of the cleaner to be 

formed therein and a steam ejection port (63) for ejecting 
steam generated from the steam generating means to a 

periphery of a revolving wet mop means (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner having 
means for vaporizing cleaning fluid. A conventional up-right electric vacuum cleaner, as 
illustrated in Figure 1, comprises: a fan motor 2 
disposed on a lower side of the body 1 for generating 
suction force according to operation of the cleaner 1; a 
dust collecting pouch 4 disposed on an upper side of the 
fan motor 2 for collecting dust sucked in through a 
suction hose 3; a brush 5 disposed on the lower side of 
the body of the cleaner 1 for being rotated according to 
operation of the fan motor 2; and a suction head 6 
disposed on the lower side of the body of the cleaner 1 
for sucking dust into a suction port 6a to dispatch the 
same to the suction hose 3. Furthermore, a cover 7 is fitted to a front of the body 
1 of the cleaner, so that the same can be opened and 
closed for change of the dust collecting pouch 4, and a 
plurality of exhaust holes 8 are formed on a lower side 
of the cover 7 in order to discharge sucked air to an 
outside of the body 1. Accordingly, when a strong suction force is generated 
within the body 1 of the cleaner according to the 
operation of the fan motor 2, the air along with the 
dust, sucked into the suction port 6a by operation of the 
brush 5, is dispatched to the dust collecting pouch 4  
 
through the suction hose 3, and only the air purified by 
passing through the dust collecting pouch 4 is discharged 
to the atmosphere through an exhaust port 8 while the 
dust is collected inside the dust collecting pouch 4 
because the same cannot pass through the pouch 4. As seen from the foregoing, the dust, waste or the like 
can be collected by the conventional technique to a 
degree. However there has been a problem in that stains 
absorbed into a floor, old stains or the like cannot be 
removed, decreasing the cleaning effectiveness markedly 
and causing inconvenience to users by requiring separate 
wiping with a damp cloth or the like. The above-identified cleaner can achieve the effect of 
wet-mop cleaning to a degree but it is difficult to 
remove stains absorbed into the floor or old stains. 
Besides, there is a problem in that the cleaning 
effectiveness is reduced due to excess water delivery 
thereby leaving behind stains after the cleaning. 
Furthermore, the excess water is unhygienic and can lead 
to the spread of harmful germs. DE-U-9216531 discloses a vacuum cleaner including driving 
means for generation a suction force, a source of 
cleaning fluid and delivery means for delivering cleaning 
fluid
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vacuum cleaner including driving means (40, 43) for 
generation a suction force (40), a source (30) of 

cleaning fluid (W), mopping means (62) for removing 
liquid from said floor, 

a heater (22) for vaporizing the cleaning fluid (W), 
delivery means (24,36), for 

delivering cleaning fluid (W) from said source (30) to a 
floor to be cleaned or the mopping means, wherein the 

delivery means (24,36) includes a conduit conveying 
exhaust (44) from the driving means (43) to the heater and an 

atomizing means (23) for atomizing said cleaning fluid 
and ejecting it into said conduit. 
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the 
source of cleaning fluid comprises a reservoir (31), 

mounted to the cleaner, for storing a predetermined 
quantity of liquid. 
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 1 or 2, 
including dust collecting means (50) for separating dust 

from waste water drawn through the suction head. 
A vacuum cleaner according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the suction head has a suction port (61) and a 

steam ejection port (63) for ejecting steam generated in 
the heater onto the periphery of the mopping means (62).
