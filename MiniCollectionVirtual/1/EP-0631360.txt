<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for monitoring the position of a switch (1) is specified. This apparatus comprises an auxiliary voltage source (2) which is connected to the switch (1), first means (3) for converting the position of the switch into an electrical signal, second means (4) for transmitting the electrical signal, and third means (5) for evaluating the transmitted information. The conversion comprises pulse-duration modulation, whose switched-on duration is selected to be greater the smaller the voltage Uo of the auxiliary voltage source is. In consequence, a monitoring device is obtained which can be used for any auxiliary voltages without any matching being necessary. Furthermore, a method is specified for monitoring the position of a switch (1).
