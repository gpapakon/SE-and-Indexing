<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a surgical device for producing a generally circular, interlamellar pathway within the corneal stroma of the eye. The device is made up of three major components: a vacuum centering guide (50) having an inner bore (62) which fits at one end against the front of the eye, a barrel which fits within the inner bore of the centering guide and to which is attached the third major component, a generally circular dissecting ring. The dissecting ring (66) is shaped in such way that when an eye surgeon twists the barrel to which the ring is attached, the ring moves through the interlamellar space in the stroma producing the desired channel or pathway. The centering guide (62) may optionally include a ring having one or more pins which firmly engage the cornea's epiphilium. The constituent parts of the surgical device, particularly the dissecting ring, also form a part of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a surgical device for
producing a generally circular, interlamellar pathway
within the corneal stroma of the eye. The device is made
up of three major components: a vacuum centering guide
having an inner bore which fits at one end against the
front of the eye, a barrel which fits within the inner
bore of the centering guide and to which is attached the
third major component, a generally circular dissecting
ring. The dissecting ring is shaped in such a way that
when an eye surgeon twists the barrel to which the ring
is attached, the ring moves through the interlamellar
space in the stroma producing the desired channel or
pathway. The centering guide may optionally include a
ring having one or more pins which firmly engage the
cornea's epiphilium. The constituent parts of the
surgical device, particularly the dissecting ring, also
form a part of this invention.A split ring, or intracorneal ring ("ICR"), is
inserted into the intrastromal passageway produced by the
inventive device. The ICR changes the shape of the
cornea and, in doing so, provides a chosen measure of
visual correction.Anomalies in the overall shape of the eye can
cause visual disorders. Hyperopia ("farsightedness")
occurs when the front-to-back distance in the eyeball is 
too small. In such a case, parallel rays originating
greater than 20 feet from the eye focus behind the
retina. In contrast, when the front-to-back distance of
eyeball is too large, myopia ("nearsightedness") occurs
and the focus of parallel rays entering the eye occurs in
front of the retina. Astigmatism is a condition which
occurs when the parallel rays of light do not come to a
single point within the eye, but rather have a variable
focus due to the fact that the cornea is aspherical and
refracts light in a different meridian at different
distances. Some degree of astigmatism is normal, but
where it is too high, it must often be corrected.Hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism are usually
corrected by glasses or contact lenses. Surgical methods
for the correction of such disorders are known. Such
methods include radial keratotomy (see, e.g., U.S.
Patents Nos. 4,815,463 and 4,688,570) and laser corneal
ablation (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,941,093).Another method for correcting those disorders
is through the implantation of polymeric rings in the
eye's corneal stroma to change the curvature of the
cornea. Previous work involving the implantation of
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) rings, allograft corneal
tissue, and hydrogels is well documented. One of the

A corneal vacuum centering guide and dissector
assembly, comprising a support base (50) having a

proximal end; a distal end; a central section having a
wall forming a generally cylindrical bore (54) with a

central axis for slidably receiving said dissector assembly, the central section extending between the
proximal and distal ends of the support base (50), the

bore (54) having a length and a diameter, the ratio of
the length to the diameter being between about 0.4:1 and

15:1, and the support base (50) including an annular vacuum chamber (52) located at the
proximal end and adapted to create an annular vacuum

space when placed against the eye.
The guide of claim 1, wherein the ratio is
between 0.4:1 and 1:1.
The guide of claim 1, wherein the ratio is at
least 1:1 and less than about 3:1.
The guide of claim 1, wherein the ratio is at
least 3:1 but less than about 15:1.
The guide of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the annular vacuum chamber (52) has an inner wall

(70) and an outer wall (72) and at least one of the inner
and outer walls has integral ridges or vanes (74) which

are adapted to extend down to and contact the eye during
use.
The guide of claim 5, wherein the vacuum
chamber (52) contains integral ridges (74).
The assembly of claim 5, wherein the vacuum
chamber contains radial vanes.
The guide of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the vacuum chamber contains an insert (101) detachably

mounted to the proximal end of the support base, which
insert contains short pins mounted to engage the cornea

during use.
The guide of any one of the preceding claims in 
combination with a corneal centering and fixation guide

(62), said guide having an outer diameter which slidably
fits within the bore (54) of the support base (50) and a

reticle coincident with the central axis of the support
base.
The guide of claim 9, wherein the corneal
vacuum centering guide additionally comprises a viewing

port (55) through the wall of the central section.
The guide of any one of the preceding claims in
combination with a knife (68) adapted to place a small

incision in the eye.
The guide of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said dissector assembly comprises a generally

cylindrical barrel (64) and a dissector blade (66)
coupled with said barrel, said barrel being adapted to be

slidably received within the bore (54) of the support
base (50) and said dissector blade being adapted to form

a channel within the cornea of the eye.
A corneal vacuum centering guide and a
dissector assembly to be used in combination, said

corneal vacuum centering guide comprising a support base
(50) having a proximal end portion, a distal end portion,

and a central section disposed therebetween, said central
section having a wall forming a generally cylindrical

bore (54), and the support base (50) including a vacuum chamber (52) located at said
