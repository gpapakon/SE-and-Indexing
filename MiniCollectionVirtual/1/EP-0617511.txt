<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
digital holding apparatus for holding instantaneous 
digital information borne by an optical signal. In opposition to a digital electronic technique 
represented by an electronic computer, a digital 
optical technique in which an electronic transmission 
medium is replaced from electrons to light to attain 
a high speed operation has been drawing the attention. 
In the digital optical technique, a current target is 
set at a digital optical computer and various methods 
and apparatus have been proposed and tested for an 
optical digital element which is a base of the 
configuration of the digital optical computer. One of 
the required optical digital devices for such an 
optical digital system is an optical digital holding 
apparatus which holds instantaneous digital 
information borne by an optical signal. Conventional optical digital holding apparatus 
which has been proposed and tested are as follows. 
(1) A first conventional optical digital holding 
device uses a method in which an intensity of an  
 
external light irradiation to the non-linear optical 
absorptive material in the etalon resonator is varied 
to control the transmittance thereof having a 
hysteresis characteristic.  (2) A second conventional optical digital holding 
device uses a method in which a nonlinear optical 
absorptive region is formed in an etalon resonator of 
a laser diode (hereinafter called LD), and is 
irradiated with the light to enhance the transmittance 
to generate laser oscillation.  (3) A third conventional optical digital memory 
device uses a method in which a light transmitted 
through an electro optical crystal is received and 
converted into electrons and this electric signal is 
transmitted so that it is a positive feedback to the 
electro optical crystal.  (4) A forth conventional optical digital holding 
device uses a method in which an output light of an 
LED or an LD is received in a photo diode (PD), and an 
output electric signal of the PD is returned. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an optical digital holding apparatus with 
simple construction, in which no bias light 
irradiation or complicated erase operation is 
required.  An optical digital holding apparatus of the 
present invention carries out functions of a flip-flop 
apparatus (RS flip-flop, D-type flip-flop etc.) which 
is a kind of the electrical digital holding apparatus, 
and can be achieved by placing an optical connecting 
wiring having a direct or indirect feedback
