<DESCRIPTION>
 AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to an amplifier circuit and particularly, but not exclusively, to an amplifier 5 circuit for amplifying signal components in the audio ft frequency range. BACKGROUND ARTThe output signal of an amplifier usually includes unwanted distortion components. These distortion10 components are mainly harmonic components caused by nonÂ¬ linear characteristics within the amplifier and inter- modulation components caused by inter- modulation between signals within the amplifier. In order to reduce the distortion components in the output signal, it is well15 known to provide a feedback circuit comprising an attenuator, the output of which is supplied to the input of the amplifier as a negative feedback signal. Where such a feedback circuit is provided, both the gain and the distortion components in the output signal of the20 amplifier will be determined primarily by the attenuator. As an attenuator may be constructed from components having substantially linear characteristics, such a feedback circuit is effective to reduce distortion components to a low but measurable level. It would, however, be desirable25 to reduce distortions still further below the levels achievable with conventional feedback circuits. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide a new or improved amplifier circuit in which the distortion30 components in the output signal are reduced below the levels achievable with conventional feedback circuits. if According to this invention, there is provided an amplifier circuit comprising a main amplifier section having an input for receiving an input signal and an 

output for delivering an output signal, and a feedback circuit comprising means for attenuating the output signal to the level of the input signal to produce an attenuated signal, means for obtaining the difference between the input signal and the attenuated signal to produce a difference signal, means for amplifying the difference signal to produce a feedback signal, and means for supplying the feedback signal to the input of the main amplifier section as a negative feedback signal. Preferably, the feedback circuit includes means for correcting the phase of the input signal prior to supplying the input signal to the difference obtaining means.Conveniently, in the feedback circuit, the gain of the amplifying means expressed as the ratio of output voltage to the input voltage is greater for DC signal components than for signal components in the audio frequency
