<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an assembly of a first panel (1), 
comprising at least one insertion opening (11) extending inwardly of 

the panel (1) from one edge (12) thereof, and a second panel (2) 
comprising at least one projecting tab (21) extending outwardly of 

the panel (2) from one edge (22) thereof and fitting in said opening 
(11), wherein said tab (21) has at least one shoulder (31) located 

between the top (32) and the base (33) of said tab, with said 
shoulder (31) abutting on said first panel (1), and with said one 

edge (12) of the first panel (1) remaining out of contact with said 
one edge (22) of the second panel (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a panel assembly, particularly suitable 
for use in apparatus. Most apparatus as e.g. a photographic camera, a processor for 
exposed materials, an optoelectronic scanner, a xerographic copier 
or a thermal printer, are mounted within a generally rectangular 
housing, which may include a rectangular metal frame for supporting 
various parts of the apparatus. 
In many of these apparatus, the mechanical geometry of the frame 
panels, especially the relative distance between them, is very 
important for guaranteeing a qualitative and reliable operation of 
said apparatus. The frame of the apparatus thus has to be designed and manufactured 
within rather small and stable tolerances, thereby minimising the 
creation of disturbing splits between said panels. Thereabove the 
frame thus formed must have a geometry which requires no adjustment 
after it has been assembled and which is stable in time. It is noted that it is well known to provide panel assemblies in which a first panel has an opening in an edge thereof which receives a tab on an edge of a second panel. Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved assembly of a first panel with a second panel in a well 
defined geometrical relationship such that the distance between said 
panels is correct in at least one direction, and this without the 
use of supplementary positioning means, or of complicated machining. These and other objects of invention will become apparent from the 
following description.  
 We now have found that the above objects can be achieved by providing 
an assembly of a first panel, comprising at least one (non 
closed) insertion opening extending inwardly of the panel from one 
edge thereof, and a second panel comprising at least one projecting 
tab extending outwardly of the panel from one edge thereof and 
fitting in said opening, characterised in that said tab has at least one shoulder 
located between the top and the base of said tab, with said shoulder 
abutting on said first panel, and with said one edge of the first 
panel remaining out of contact with said one edge of the second 
panel. Embodiments of the present invention are set forth in the 
detailed description given hereinbelow. The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying 
drawings without limiting the invention thereto, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a schematic side view of an apparatusframe which comprises 
panel plates; Fig. 2 is a fragmentary perspective view of an assembly according

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An assembly of a first panel (1), comprising at least one ((non 
closed)) insertion opening (11) extending inwardly of the panel (1) 

from one edge (12) thereof, and a second panel (2) comprising at 
least one projecting tab (21) extending outwardly of the panel (2) 

from one edge (22) thereof and fitting in said opening (11), 

characterised in that said tab (21) has at least one shoulder (31) located between 
the top (32) and the base (33) of said tab, with said shoulder (31) 

abutting on said first panel (1), and with said one edge (12) of the 
first panel (1) remaining out of contact with said one edge (22) of 

the second panel (2). 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said second panel (2) 
is in a plane perpendicular to the plane of said first panel (1). 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein said second panel (2) 
is in a plane parallel to the plane of said first panel (1). 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 3, wherein said second panel 
(2) is in a plane coinciding with the plane of said first panel (1). 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 or 4, wherein the shape 
of said projecting tab (21) corresponds with the shape of said 

insertion opening (11). 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein said 
projecting tab (21) has two shoulder edges (31), formed by corresponding 

tab portions, one at each lateral side of the tab (21). 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein said 
second panel (2) has at least two projecting tabs (53, 54) lying 

substantially in a same plane and wherein said first panel comprises 
corresponding insertion openings (51, 52). 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 7, wherein said tab 
(21) is located in the plane of said first panel (1).
