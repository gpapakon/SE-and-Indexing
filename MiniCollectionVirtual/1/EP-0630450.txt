<ABSTRACT>
In a cable lock and a seal device a roller (13) is rotatable about a single axis normal to the axis of an inextensible member (7) and with respect to a ramp (14) which, in turn, is inclined with respect to the axis of the inextensible member (7). The roller (13) is moveable up and down the ramp (14) between a retracted position in which the member (7) can be drawn through a passage (5) in the device and a locking position in which the roller (13) rolls up the ramp to clamp the member against movement in the opposite direction with the member (7) trapped between the roller (13) and the opposite face of the passage (5). A spring (21) acts on the roller (13) to urge it up the ramp (14) at all times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cable lock and seal 
devices, of the kind consisting of a body enclosing a 
spring held friction member and having a passage 
therethrough and a flexible inextensible member having 
one end attached to the body, the opposite end being 
adapted to pass through the passage and engage the 
friction member therein. A cable lock device of the kind set forth is 
described in US-A-830 565. The passage in this device 
contains within it a larger chamber divided into upper 
and lower parts by a leaf spring. A small ball of 
diameter larger than that of the passage is held in the 
chamber. If the ball is above the leaf spring as the 
inextensible member passes down through the passage, 
the ball overcomes the force of the leaf spring and is 
held in a space defined by the leaf spring, the member 
and a stop provided in the lower part of the chamber. 
When an attempt is made to withdraw the inextensible 
member the ball is rolled between the moving 
inextensible member and the leaf spring due to the 
friction between the two. The ball overcomes the force 
of the leaf spring and continues to move upwards until 
it becomes wedged between the inextensible member and 
an inclined wall of the chamber which meets the 
passage-way. The inextensible member is thus held fast 
and cannot be removed from the locking device. In a cable lock and seal device of the kind set 
forth in which the friction member comprises a ball, 
there is a tendency for the ball to rotate relative to 
the body in response to a force applied to the ball 
from the helically arranged strands which comprise the 
inextensible member and when a force is applied to the  
 
member in a longitudinal direction. Thus, when a 
sufficient force is applied to the member 
longitudinally, it can be withdrawn from the body with 
the ball rotating in a path as dictated by its 
engagement with the inextensible member. We are aware of the document FR-A-2 388 114 which 
discloses the pre-characterising features of claim 1. According to our invention in a cable lock and 
seal device comprising a body enclosing a spring held 
friction member and having a passage therethrough and a 
flexible inextensible member having one end attached to 
the body, the opposite end being adapted to pass 
through the passage and engage the friction member 
therein in which the friction member comprises a roller

A cable lock and seal device comprising a body 
enclosing a spring held friction member and having a 

passage (15) therethrough and a flexible inextensible 
member (7) having one end attached to the body, the 

opposite end being adapted to pass through the 
passage (5) and engage the friction member therein in 

which the friction member comprises a roller (13) which 
is rotatable about a single axis normal to the axis of 

the inextensible member (7) and with respect to a 

ramp (14), in turn, inclined with respect to the axis 
of the inextensible member (7) with which the 

roller (13) co-operates during movement between a 
retracted position in which the inextensible member (7) 

can be drawn through the passage (5) and a locking 
position in which the roller (13) rolls up the 

ramp (14) to clamp the inextensible member (7) against 
movement in the opposite direction with the 

inextensible member (7) trapped between the roller (13) 
and the opposite face (3) of the passage (5), a 

spring (21) acting on the roller (13) to urge it up the 
ramp (14) at all times, and in which the spring (21) 

comprises a leaf spring having a finger (22) which 
extends into the passage at the lower end of the ramp 

and acts on the peripheral edge of the roller (13) to 
bias it up the ramp towards its upper end, 

characterised in that the finger (22) comprises one of 
a pair of spaced limbs, and the second limb of the pair 

is contiguous with a skeletal base (23) portion by 
means of which the spring is anchored in the body (2), 

the first limb being deflectable with respect to the 
second limb, and the second limb being deflectable with 

respect to the base portion.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 1, in which the 
peripheral edge or surface of the roller (13) is 

roughened or otherwise serrated to enhance its grip 
with the inextensible member. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, in which the 
peripheral edge or surface of the roller (13) is also 

formed with at least one circumferentially extending 
Vee groove (31) which enhances the grip on the 

inextensible member (7) and centralises the roller (13) 
in the passage. 
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, in 
which the peripheral edge or surface of the roller (13) 

is formed with an annular groove (31) complementary in 
outline to the profile of the inextensible member (7). 
A device as claimed in claim 4, in which the 
groove (31) is of part-circular outline. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, in which the 
groove (31) is of shallow Vee-outline. 
A device as claimed in any of claims 3 to 6, in 
which the groove itself is divided into a central 

land (34) disposed between axially spaced lands (35 + 
36) at opposite sides of the roller (13). 
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, in 
which the body is of composite construction comprising 

a hollow outer casing (1), and a ramp block (2) which 
is contained in the casing and which is mounted 

centrally in the casing so that a pair of spaced 
parallel passages are defined between the casing and 

the side edges of the block, one of the edges of the  
 

block being adapted to define the ramp and an anchorage 
for the leaf spring (21). 
A device as claimed in claim 8, in which the outer 
casing (1) comprises an extrusion, and the block (2) 

has local recess (8) into which the material of the 
casing is deformed to stake one end portion of the 

inextensible member (7), the casing, and the block 
together.
