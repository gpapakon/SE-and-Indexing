<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for the separation into phases of a sample of 
liquid, including colloidal suspensions, having a 
plurality of phases of differing densities, and for the 
separation and maintaining of the separation of one phase 
of the liquid sample from the remainder of the liquid. 
The invention is particularly useful in the separation of 
blood into components thereof, especially for purposes of 
testing and analysis of blood components. The liquid to be separated is contained in a 
chamber, typically a tube, containing a separation 
device. The chamber is rotated, either axially i.e. 
about its longitudinal axis, or in a conventional 
centrifuge i.e. about an axis perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis, to cause the liquid to separate into 
distinct phases, during which rotation a separation 
device is moved through the liquid to physically separate 
at least one of the phases. The separation device 
maintains the separation at the conclusion of the 
rotation and through subsequent handling steps. Diagnostic tests frequently require separation of a 
patient's whole blood sample into components, especially 
cellular portions from non-cellular portions e.g. serum 
or plasma from cells. For instance, plasma is obtained 
from anticoagulated blood and still contains all of the 
coagulation proteins, whereas serum is obtained from 
clotted blood with the bulk of the coagulation proteins 
being retained with the clot and red blood cells. 
Samples of whole blood are typically collected by 
venipuncture through a special cannula or needle attached 
to a syringe or an evacuated collection tube. The sample 
of blood in the form that is to be separated into 
components is typically drawn, using a needle, through a 
penetrable self-sealing elastomeric closure or other  
 
stopper into an evacuated tube. Separation is then 
accomplished e.g. by rotation of the tube in a 
conventional centrifuge e.g. a swinging bucket or a fixed 
angle centrifuge, as the different components of the 
whole blood have different densities, as described in 
U.S. Patent 4 152 269 of A.L. Babson. It is frequently desirable to physically isolate the 
separated phases from each other, so that separation of 
the phases is maintained after centrifugal rotation has 
ceased. Isolation may be accomplished by interposing a 
gel material between the phases, the gel material 
typically being a silicone that is placed in the tube at 
the time of manufacture. These gels have densities that 
are

A method of partitioning a pre-selected phase 
of a sample of liquid having a plurality of phases of 

differing densities, comprising the steps of: 

(a) containing said sample of liquid in a first chamber (20) 
of a linear tube (10), said tube having a second chamber (21) that 

is separated from the first chamber by a separation 
device (19), said second chamber (21) being free of the liquid, 

said separation device (19) slidably engaging the interior 
surface of the tube (10) in a fluid-tight manner and having an 

axial orifice (29) on the longitudinal axis of the tube (10) that 
is in fluid flow communication with a flow-restriction 

channel (64), said flow-restriction channel being off-set from 

the longitudinal axis of the tube (10), said flow-restriction 
channel (64) having a convoluted path with at least two 

axially-oriented sections with opposed directions of 
fluid flow, said axial orifice (29) being in fluid flow 

communication with the first chamber (20) and said flow-restriction 
channel (64) being in fluid flow communication 

with the second chamber (21); 
(b) ordering the phases of the sample concentrically by 
rotating the tube around its longitudinal axis; 
(c) while the phases are ordered, reducing the volume of 
the first chamber (20) by movement of the separation device (19) 

within the tube (10), that phase of the liquid located axially 
within the first chamber (20) flowing into the axial orifice (29) 

and passing through the flow-restriction channel (64) into the 
second chamber (21); and 
(d) deriving phase-separation information from the 
location of the interface between the phases and 

controlling the reduction of the volume of the first 
chamber (20) on the basis of the phase-separation information.

channel is a single continuous channel. 
The method of Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which the 
flow-restriction channel permits flow of liquid from the
