<ABSTRACT>
A method and device are provided for directing laser radiation in a conical beam to a tissue site to be irradiated. The conical beam can be positioned to impinge upon the tissue in a circular, elliptical, or any other pattern that can be generated by a conical section interacting with a planar or curved surface. In one form the contemplated device includes an optical fiber (20) and a lense (80) that focuses a laser beam at an oblique angle on the proximal end surface (70) of the optic fiber so as to emit from the distal end of the optical fiber (47) a laser beam having a conical configuration (99). In another form, the contemplated device includes an optical fiber (200) having a conical distal end (247) and a lens that focuses a laser beam on the proximal end surface (270) of the optical fiber (200) along the longitudinal axis of the fiber. The conical laser beam can be used to irradiate or sculpt tissue such as the cornea of an eye to change the refractive characteristic thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>

 "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING LASER RADIATION"
 TECHNICAL FIELD
 The present invention relates to devices and procedures for the controlled delivery of laser energy through an optical fiber. The present invention is especially suitable for treating a site on the surface of, or inside, a patient's body, with laser energy in a ring or hollow beam configuration, with little or virtually none of the light energy being emitted in the center of the ring or hollow beam.


 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 AND
 TECHNICAL   PROBLEMS    POSED BY THE PRIOR ART
 Articulated arms using an arrangement of mirrors, optical microscopes and other devices have been developed for delivering laser energy to the surface of a patent's body. Flexible, optical fibers are used to convey laser energy in surgery to tissue or into a confined space. Fibers can also be advanced through an artery or other body lumen or cavity, an endoscopic device, or a surgically created passage, to a selected internal treatment location. In certain medical applications, such devices include, or are incorporated in, catheters for transmitting the radiation to internal body sites.


 Medical instruments of the above-described type may be broadly defined as fiber delivery systems.


As used in this specification and in the claims, the term "fiber system" or   "system"    is intended to include broadly flexible, or rigid, instruments for directing laser energy to a target site on the body's surface or  satisfactorily in the particular applications for which they are intended, it would be desirable to provide an improved fiber optic system for laser delivery in ophthalmology, angioplasty, surgery, or even manufacturing wherein the laser radiation could be directed to the site in a controlled manner. In particular, in some applications it would be desirable to emit a laser beam so as to produce a target tissue irradiation zone having an annular, ring or hollow conical beam pattern.


 It would also be advantageous if such a device could be adapted for use with relatively higher power lasers in annealing the inner surfaces of tubes, cutting circles in materials, and other applications in which a defined closed loop, e.g., a ring, of laser energy could be effectively employed.


 Preferably, such an improved device is not bulky or unduly complex. It would be advantageous if a relatively simple and small structure could be provided for use as, or in, a catheter or other device to be inserted within a confined space.


 It would also be desirable to
