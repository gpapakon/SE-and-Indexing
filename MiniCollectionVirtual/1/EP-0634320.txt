<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to aircraft landing gear, of the lateral-retraction type, having twin wheels. In accordance with the invention, the leg (50) is formed by an inverted-L casing (10), the two branches (11, 12) of which are articulated together, with a first branch forming a beam (11) articulated onto the aircraft structure, and a second branch (12) at the end of which a bogie beam (14) is articulated, carrying the wheels. The bogie beam (14) is furthermore linked to the first branch (11) by a damper (17). A controlling guide bar (23) finally links the second branch (12) via a clevis (25) mounted in journals on the said branch, to the aircraft structure, so as to advance this second branch when the gear is raised, this advance causing a retraction of the wheels due to the fact that the damper (17) then acts as a second guide bar.
