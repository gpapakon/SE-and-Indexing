<ABSTRACT>
A zero insertion force connector (16) includes a pair of spring clamp jaws (50A, 50B) each having a flexible circuit (12A, 12B) attached thereto. The clamp jaws are confrontationally arranged so that a portion of each clamp jaw adjacent to the rearward end thereof define a channel (98) through which the flexible circuits pass. Each flexible circuit (12A, 12B) is attached to a spring clamp jaw within a region on the circuit that is free of tracings (14A, 14B). An actuator (106A) provided within concave portions (99A, 99B) of each jaw to open the same and bring the conductive tracings on the flexible circuits into registration with the conductive tracings (C) on a substrate (B). Wiping action between the tracings is generated by engagement between an abutment surface (28A, 28B, 30A, 30B) on a fixture and a camming surface (124A, 124B) carried on the connector. A centering action to register the tracings is simultaneously generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a
connector system for a flexible circuit, and, in particular, to a
zero insertion force connector system for interconnecting a
flexible circuit to a substrate.Description of the Prior Art In general, mechanical
connector structures in the form of an insulated housing with
individual spring contact beams cannot be effectively utilized
when the desired spacing between the conductors to which
interconnection is desired is less than 0.050 inches. For such
circumstances it is believed necessary to utilize a flexible
circuit arrangement.A flexible circuit is an electrical conductor structure in
which a base sheet of polyimide or polyester film material has
conductive tracings photolithographed thereon. Suitable for
use as the base sheet for such flexible circuit arrangement is
the polyimide or polyester film material such as manufactured
and sold by E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. under the
trademarks "Kapton" or "Mylar", respectively.Such a flexible circuit may be interconnected with
either a conventional circuit board substrate or another flexible
circuit using any one of a variety of known connector
constructions. For example, the flexible circuit may be
wrapped about a core and the core secured in proximity to a
substrate in the manner disclosed and claimed in United States 
Patent 4,552,420 (Eigenbrode), assigned to the assignee of the
present invention.In another implementation the member to which the
flexible circuit is to be connected may be clamped between a
pair of parallel beams. This arrangement is shown in United
States Patent 4,647,125 (Landi et al.) and in the connector
disclosed in United States Patent 4,690,472 (Elco et al.),
assigned to the assignee of the present invention. This last-mentioned
patent is also noteworthy for its disclosure of
wedge-shaped positioning guides which align the conductive
features of the circuits being interconnected.As another alternative the end of the flexible circuit may
be bent around a mantle or curved tongue and brought into
sliding engagement with the member to which it is to be
connected. Contact with the flexible circuit is made by spring
members. The flexible circuit trails rearwardly from the
connector. This arrangement is believed exemplified in the
connectors disclosed in United States Patent 3,897,130
(Donnelley), United States Patent 3,941,448 (Evans), United
States Patent 4,248,491 (Mouissie, also assigned to the assignee
of the present invention), United States Patent 4,684,183
