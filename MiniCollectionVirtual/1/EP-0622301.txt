<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for recognising leakages on a machine 1, especially a rotary machine, for the packaging of products under a vacuum. At least two chambers 2, 2a are provided. Furthermore, there are two pressure switches 18, 19 which, between a switching valve 14 and a valve 13, serve for controlling the connection of the chambers 2, 2a. The first pressure switch 18 serves for opening the first switching valve 14 to the first vacuum source 5 only when the filled chamber is leak-proof. The first switching valve 14 is closed again via the second pressure switch 19 when the desired pressure level in relation to the first vacuum source 5 has been reached. This ensures that leakages are recognised and a connection to the chamber is made only when the latter is actually closed.

An evacuating device with a plurality of chambers 
(2, 2a) which, for the purpose of being evacuated down 

to a predetermined pressure level through connecting 
lines (3, 4), are connectable, one after the other, 

to a plurality of vacuum sources (5, 6) whose pressure 
is stepped downwards, with the connection being 

effected by valve control means associated with the 
connecting lines (3, 4),
 
characterised in
 
that the valve control means comprise a valve (13) 

which is connected in front of the chamber(s) (2, 2a) 
and which connects the chambers (2, 2a) with one each 

of the connecting lines (3, 4) or a further evacuating 
device, with switching valves (14, 15) being arranged 

in the connecting lines (3, 4) between the connection 
with the valve (13) and the vacuum sources (5, 6); that 

a first pressure switch (18) is provided between the 
first switching valve (14) of the connecting line (3) 

leading to the vacuum source (5) with the highest 
pressure level and the connection with the valve (13); 

that, when a certain first pressure level (pa) is 
reached, the first pressure switch (18) causes the 

first switching valve (14) to be opened and that, when 
said level is not reached, it causes the further 

switching valves (15) to be closed; that, when the 
first switching valve (14) is open and a second 

predetermined pressure level (pb) which is below the 
first pressure level (pa) is reached, the second 

pressure switch (19) reacts and causes the first 
switching valve (14) to be closed; and that the first  

 
evacuating device serves to evacuate the chamber (2) 

down to the pressure level at which the first pressure 
switch (18) reacts. 
An evacuating device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the pressure level (pa) at which the first 

pressure switch (18) reacts corresponds to a pressure 
level which is higher than the pressure level which 

occurs in the chamber when connected to the further 
evacuating device, but lower than the atmospheric 

pressure. 
An evacuating device according to any one of claims 
1 or 2,
 
characterised in
 
that the further evacuating device is formed by the 

vacuum of a chamber (2a) which has already been 
evacuated and which is connectable to the chamber (2) 

to be evacuated by means of the valve (13). 
An evacuating device according to claim 3,
 
characterised in
 
that between the valve (13) and the first switching 

valve (14) there is arranged an equalising reservoir 
(16) which - in case, in the chamber (2a) connected by 

means of the valve (13) to the chamber (2) to be 
evacuated there is no vacuum or too low a vacuum for 

the exchange of pressure - is connectable to the 
chamber (2) to be evacuated for the purpose of an 

exchange of pressure to achieve the reaction pressure 
of the first pressure switch (18). 
An evacuating device according to claim 4,
 
characterised in
 
that the pressure switches (18, 19) are connected to 

the equalising reservoir (16).  
 
An evacuating device according to any one of claims 
1 to 5,
 
characterised in
 
that there are provided two vacuum sources (5, 6) whose 

pressure is stepped downwards. 
An evacuating device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the first pressure switch (18), with a delay in 

time, causes the further switching valves (15) to be 
transferred into the closed position if the measured 

pressure level is higher than that of the first 
pressure level (pa), which further switching valves 

(15) are opened with a delay in time corresponding to 
the cycle time of the connection of a subsequent 

chamber (2, 2a) in which there exists a pressure level 
lower than that of the first pressure level (pa). 
An evacuating device according to any one of claims 
1 to 6,
 
characterised in
 
that the vacuum sources are formed by the vacuum 

reservoirs (5, 6) of a central vacuum system (10). 
An evacuating device according to any one of claims 
1 to 7,
 
characterised
 
by being used in a packaging machine with at least two 

chambers (2, 2a) which, one after the other, are guided 
to different stations of which the first station is 

the inserting station and the last station the 
ventilation and removal station and that the chambers 

(2, 2a), after having left the inserting station, for 
the purpose of being evacuated, are connectable one 

after the other to vacuum sources (5, 6) whose pressure 
is stepped downwards.
