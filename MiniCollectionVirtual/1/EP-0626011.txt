<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for continuous
preparation of biocatalyst particles, where the
particles have uniform size and spherical shape.The term biocatalyst in this connection refers to a biological
system comprising microorganisms or cells, as well as
parts thereof, e.g., enzymes. By biocatalyst particles is
meant biocatalysts that are fixed (immobilized) by means of a
macroscopic carrier, e.g., a hydrocolloid gel, enabling the
system to carry out metabolic processes.Industrial utilization of biocatalyst particles has been
limited by the possibility of producing such particles.
Various processes for producing these particles have been
described previously.The simplest method is described in German patent DE 2835875
and is based on dripping an alginate solution out of a tube
having a small diameter. The disadvantage of this method is
that the size of the alginate beads (due to the high
viscosity of the solution) is almost independent of the tube
dimension and therefore cannot be varied in a simple way.A further development of the aforementioned procedure is to
blow out the droplet with pressurized air. It is thereby
possible to vary the size of the droplets. The problem is
the high production costs required for this method.A third method is to subject the alginate solution to
oscillation, thus causing the droplets to "shoot" out of a
thin tube. This method has ample capacity, but produces 
varying sizes of alginate beads. Industrial evaluation of
this method has found it to be too costly.The fourth method is described in DE 3417899 C2 "Verfaren zur
Herstellung perlförminger Biokatalysatoren und zur Steigerung
der Durchsatzkapazität und Vorrictung zu einer Durchfürung."
Said patent describes a production method for spherical
immobilized biocatalysts. In this method alginate droplets
are hurled out of a perforated cylinder and caught by a
rotating centrifuge basin filled with CaCl2-solution. Due to
the rotation, the CaCl2 solution climbs up along the wall of
the centrifige basin. The rotating, perforated cylinder is
placed down in the centrifuge basin so that the alginate
beads that are hurled out migrate horizontally until they hit
the CaCl2 solution. The method has a high capacity and the
size of the alginate beeds may be varied. The disadvantage
of this method is that it is mechanically complicated and
difficult to use in aseptic processes. By aseptic process,
in this connection, is meant a process that does not contain
any bacteria other than the desired ones. The alginate
