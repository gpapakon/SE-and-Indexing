<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods wherein an olefin may be selectively 
oxidized to an epoxide. More particularly, this invention pertains to catalytic 
epoxidation processes employing certain transition metals entrapped in a porous 
carbon matrix as catalyst and organic hydroperoxides as oxidizing agent. Epoxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1,2-butene oxide and 
the like are useful intermediates for the preparation of a wide variety of products. 
The oxirane functionality in such compounds is highly reactive and may be ring-opened 
with any number of nucleophilic reactants. For example, epoxides may 
be hydrolyzed to yield glycols useful as anti-freeze components, food additives, 
or reactive monomers for the preparation of condensation polymers such as 
polyesters. Polyether polyols generated by the ring-opening polymerization of 
epoxides are widely utilized as intermediates in the preparation of polyurethane 
foams, elastomers, sealants, coatings, and the like. The reaction of epoxides with 
alcohols provides glycol ethers, which may be used as polar solvents in a number 
of applications. Many different methods for the preparation of epoxides have been 
developed. One such method involves the epoxidation of an olefin in a liquid  
 
phase reaction using an organic hydroperoxide as the oxidizing agent and certain 
solubilized transition metal compounds as catalyst. The early work in this field 
concluded that optimum epoxidation rates and selectivity to epoxide generally 
are obtained using metallic catalysts which are soluble in an organic reaction 
medium. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,350,422 teaches in Example 6 that while 
vanadium naphthenate (a soluble catalyst) provided 72% hydroperoxide 
conversion and 38% selectivity to propylene oxide, vanadium pentoxide (an 
insoluble species) gave only 34% hydroperoxide conversion and 6% propylene 
oxide selectivity. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,351,635 teaches that metals such as 
molybdenum, tungsten and titanium are most effective as epoxidation catalysts 
when dissolved in the epoxidation reaction mixture. Poorly soluble species such 
as molybdenum trioxide thus are initially inactive and only become suitable for 
use in such application when converted to a soluble active form by reaction with 
alcohol, glycol, hydroperoxide or the like (see, for example, the discussion in 
Sheldon, J. Mol. Cat. 7, pp. 107-126 (1980)). A distinct disadvantage of an epoxidation process which utilizes a soluble 
metallic compound as catalyst is the
