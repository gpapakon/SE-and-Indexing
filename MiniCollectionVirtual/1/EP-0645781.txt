A DC power cable having improved dielectric strength, the cable
comprising an electrica
l core (1) and a first polymer dielectric layer (3) for
insulating said core, the cable being characterized in that said first dielectric

layer is constituted by an insulating polymer matrix containing at least one
conductive polymer which is incorporated in said polymer matrix at a

concentration by weight such that the resulting electrical conductivity of said
first layer is less than 10
-14
 S/cm at ambient temperature, and which makes
said resulting electrical conductivity of said first layer self-adaptive locally in

the presence of defects, and increases as a function of the electric field due to
the defect at a given point.
An AC power cable having improved dielectric strength, the cable
comprising an electrical core (1) and a first polymer dielectric layer (3) for

insulating said core, the cable being characterized in that said first dielectric
layer is constituted by an insulating polymer matrix containing at least one

conductive polymer which is incorporated in said polymer matrix at a
concentration by weight such that the resulting electrical conductivity of said

first layer is less than 10
-10
 S/cm at ambient temperature, and which makes
said resulting electrical conductivity of said first layer self-adaptive locally in

the presence of defects, and increases as a function of the electric field due to
the defect at a given point.
A cable according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said conductive
polymer is a polymer that is non-doped or de-doped and that its concentration

in said polymer matrix is not more than about 5% by weight.
A cable according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said conductive
polymer is a self-doped polymer whose concentration in said polymer matrix

is not more than about 2% by weight.
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 4, further including an inner
semiconductive screen (2) between the core (1) and the first dielectric layer

(3), and an outer semiconductive screen (4) between said first dielectric layer
(3) and an outer protective sheath (5), characterized in that each of said

screens is constituted by an insulating polymer matrix containing a conductive 
polymer at a concentration by weight such that the electrical conductivity of

said screens is not greater than 1 S/cm.
A cable according to claim 5, characterized in that said conductive polymer
is a polymer that is non-doped or de-doped at a concentration in said polymer

matrix of said screens lying in the range 5% to 70% by weight.
A cable according to claim 5, characterized in that said conductive polymer
is a self-doped polymer whose concentration in said polymer matrix of said

screens is greater than 5% by weight.
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it further
includes an additional second inner dielectric layer (7) underlying said first

dielectric layer (3), and an additional outer third dielectric layer (8) overlying
said first dielectric layer (3), each constituted by an insulating polymer matrix

containing a conductive polymer selected from non-doped polymers, de-doped
polymers, and self-doped polymers, the electrical conductivity of said

second and third dielectric layers lying in the range 10
-14
 S/cm to 1 S/cm for
DC use and in the range 10
-10
 S/cm to 1 S/cm for AC use.
A cable according to claim 8, characterized in that at least one of the
second and third dielectric layers comprises a plurality of sublayers (7A, 7B;

8A, 8B) having mutually different concentrations of conductive polymer, said
concentrations decreasing through the successive sublayers of said second

dielectric layer going from the innermost sublayer, and increasing through the
successive sublayers of said third dielectric layer going from the innermost

sublayer of said third dielectric layer.
