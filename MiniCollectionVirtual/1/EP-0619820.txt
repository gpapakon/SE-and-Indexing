<DESCRIPTION>
Tmidazoαuinazoline compounds and Their Preparation and Use.The present invention relates to therapeutically active imidazoquinazoline compounds, a method of preparing the same, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and to methods of treating therewith. The novel compounds are useful in psychopharmaceutical applications, e.g. in the treatment of central nervous system ailments, for example as anticonvul- sants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, antipsychotics, antiemetics, in improving the cognitive function of the brain of mammals, or as benzodiazepine antagon- ists.It is well known (Squires, R.F. and Braestrup, C. in Nature (London) 266 (1977) 732-734) that specific sites in the central nervous systems of verte¬ brates exhibit a high specific affinity for binding 1,4- and 1 ,5-benzodiaze- pines. These sites are called benzodiazepine receptors.It has now been found that members of a novel group of imidazoquinazo¬ line compounds have strong affinity for the benzodiazepine receptors which make them useful in psychopharmaceutical preparations.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide such novel imidazo¬ quinazoline compounds.The compounds of the invention have the general formula I(I)
 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts or hydrates thereof, wherein Q is-COOR8 or -CN;wherein R1 is hydrogen, straight or branched C^-alkyl, unsubstituted or C^-alkyl substituted G^-cycloalkyl, C^-alkoxy, C^-alkoxy-C^-alkyl or tri- fluoromethyl; R8 is straight or branched C1-6-alkyl;R2 and R3 independently are hydrogen, C^-alkyl, optionally substituted with C^-cycIoalkyl, di-C^-alkylamino, phenyl or a pϊperidinyl group optionally substituted with C^-alkyl, or R2 and R3 independently are C^-cycloalkyl,C1-6-hydroxyalkyl, C^-alkoxy, C^-alkoxy-C^-alkyl, C^-alkoxycarbonyl-C^- alkyl, formyl-C^-alkyl or a cyclic or non-cyclic acetal thereof, or R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen atom form a 4-6 membered cyclic amino group in which ring system one or more of the carbon atoms may be exchanged with nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, sulphinyl, sulphonyf or carboπyl or a hydrate, an acyclic or a cyclic acetal thereof, each of these ring systems optionally being substituted with one or more of C1α3-alkyl, C^-alkoxy- methyl, hydroxy, C^-hydroxyalkyl or phenyl;R4, R5, R6 and R7 independently are hydrogen, hydroxy, CI, Br, F, I, triffuoro- methyl, nitro, amino, cyano, straight or branched C^-alkyl, C2^-alkenyl, C2^- alkynyl, C^-alkoxy, C^-alkoxy-C^-alkyl or C^-alkoxycarbonyl;provided that R4, R5, R6, R7 at the
