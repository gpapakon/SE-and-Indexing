<CLAIMS>
A modified supported chromocene catalyst system
obtainable by


addition of an oxidising agent to a supported
chromocene catalyst
and subsequent addition of a reducing agent.
A modified supported chromocene catalyst system
as claimed in claim 1, wherein the oxidizing agent used

is a compound of a metal of transition group I, VII or
VIII of the Periodic Table or oxygen or air.
A modified supported chromocene catalyst system
as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the reducing agent

used is a hydride or organic compound of a metal of
main group I or II of the Periodic Table or of boron,

aluminum, silicon or tin.
A process for preparing a modified supported
chromocene catalyst system, which comprises adding an

oxidizing agent and subsequently a reducing agent to a
supported chromocene catalyst.
The use of a modified supported chromocene
catalyst system as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 for

preparing polyalk-1-enes.
A process for preparing polyalk-1-enes at from
-50 to +300Â°C and a pressure of from 1 to 1000 bar

using a modified supported chromocene catalyst system
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3.
