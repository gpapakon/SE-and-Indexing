<ABSTRACT>
Improvements to viewers used in recreational 
machines, in which the figures are arranged along a 

continuous band (5), and based on the fact that said band 
(5) is supported and guided by a chassis in the form of a 

pair of parallel plates (1) and (2), joined by spacers 
(3), with the particular characteristic that each of the 

opposing faces of said plates are provided with a groove 
(4) designed to receive the corresponding edge of the 

continuous band (5) with play, acting as a means of 
guiding said band. Said grooves (4) undergo a sharp 

inflection along of one of the minor sides thereof, 
defining a kind of loop (6) where the continuous band (5) 

is driven by the corresponding pulling drum (8). 
This special system for guiding the continuous band 
(5) enables the grooves (4) to define a straight section 

(4') and a curved section (4''), converting the viewer 
into a reversible element which can present either a flat 

or a convex curved working area by simply inverting its 
position in the assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cyclic image viewers,
such as those used in recreational machines, and
more particularly to viewers in which the images are
carried by a continuous, flexible band along which they
are uniformly distributed.The improvements of the invention are aimed at
achieving perfect guidance of the continuous band, enabling
its position to be adjusted perfectly according to
any practical requirement, the support of the continuous
band and its driving means furthermore constituting a
compact assembly of reduced volume.In the field of recreational machines mentioned
above, and more particularly in the field of recreational
machines which give out cash prizes, a set of viewers is
used, normally three or four, in which a set of figures
or symbols appear cyclically as if they were carried by a 
set of rotating drums, said viewers showing a certain
combination at the end of each play, possibly corresponding
to a prize.One of the wide range of solutions available regarding
the configuration of these "drums" involves the use
of a continuous band made of a flexible material, generally
a suitable plastic material, on which said figures
are conveniently printed and partially visible through a
window.Among others the Spanish utility models 261.860,
270.005, 271.429, 287.665, 9100716, 9100717 and 9202785
describe examples of this type. See also GB-A-2 150 335.All of these examples share the common feature of a
line of perforations on at least one of the edges of the
continuous band in order to move the band by means of a
pulling drum with the help of one or more rollers, normally
one or two although sometimes there are three,
designed to establish the trajectory of the continuous
band, in particular the trajectory of said band past the
corresponding viewing window.From what has been said above it can be deduced that
in any case two rollers are provided in correspondence
with the viewing window, the continuous band following a
straight trajectory between them. This may be desirable
in certain cases but not always, since the idea of this
type of viewer is to achieve an appearance similar to
that of a rotating drum. In many cases it would therefore
be desirable for the trajectory of the continuous band
past the viewing window to be curved, in particular when
said viewing window extends vertically so that several
figures can be seen simultaneously, the one corresponding
to the winning line and, for example, one or two figures
immediately above or below.Furthermore, the housing of these viewers is

Improvements to cyclic image viewers, in particular

the band with play, said groove (4) defining two sections,

Improvements to cyclic image viewers according to
claim 1, characterized in that said guide groove (4) in

each of the plates (1, 2) which constitute the chassis

band to follow the sharp bends at said inflection

zones (7).
Improvements to cyclic image viewers according to
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that between the plates

are arranged to support the edge regions of the
continuous band (5) at these points of inflection.
Improvements to cyclic image viewers according to

pulling drum (8) is located, is arranged a reduction/drive
unit (12, 13) for driving the pulling drum (8),

further incorporating in any suitable part of the chassis
any means, again conventional and suitable, for detecting

and more particularly the position of the figures which

appear on said continuous band relative to the window
through which said images are viewed.

pulley (14), is arranged such that it can pivot about the 

axis (25) of the motor (12) and is provided laterally
with a grooved tab (26) through the elongated hole (27)

of which passes a screw (28) for fixing the reduction box
(13) firmly to the intermediate wall (11) once the tension

has been adjusted in the belt (15) which transmits
the motion from said output pulley (14) to the pulley

(16) which is joined to the axis of the pulling drum (8).
Improvements to cyclic image viewers according to
claim 6, characterized in that apart from the transmission

axis (29) which ends in said output pulley (14), two
more axes (31) and (32), parallel to the previous one,

of the transmission within said reduction box, said axes

(31) and (32) ending in discs (33) and (34) respectively,
also set back within the chassis defined by the plates of

the viewer, said discs being provided with holes (35) and
(36) or any other type of indicator which, with the help

of respective opto-couplers (37, 37') or other suitable
reading means, enable the electric motor (12) to be

controlled in order to carry out the stop control of the
continuous band (5) and more particularly of the figures

thereof which can be seen through the corresponding
viewing window.

pivoting plate (38) is mounted on the output axis (29) on
which is also mounted the pulley (14) that drives the

pulling drum (8), said pivoting plate (38) being provided
with an arm (47), parallel to said axis (29), on which is

mounted a small, freely rotating roller (48) which
opposes the transmission belt (15), said pivoting plate

(38) being further provided with a spring (44) connected
between it and the viewer, said spring tending to make

said plate pivot such that the roller (48) presses
against the transmission belt (15) as a means of keeping 

it tense.

claim 8, characterized in that the end of the axis (30)

of the pulling drum or roller (8) opposite the end driven
by the motor (12), ends in a small pinion (49) situated

inside a small housing (50) in the chassis or body of the
viewer (1) and provided with a corresponding cover, said

housing also housing a reduction crown gear (51) which is
driven by said pinion and which, by means of its own axis

which passes through said cover, drives an external disc

chassis (1) and provided with a radial groove at a point
on its perimeter and with a concentric peripheral line of

equiangularly spaced holes or grooves (56) coinciding
numerically with the images (60) of the continuous band

reader (57) which controls the zeroing of the of the

viewer assembly by means of said groove (55), and the
unit advance of the images by means of the holes (56),

rebate (65) which receives the toothed tab (63) such that
it can rotate freely, said cam (66) being provided on its

lower face, or face closest to said element and at the
edge of said cam, with a stepped rebate (69) designed to

receive the toothed tab (63) when the cam is rotated into
the clamped position, whilst the opposite edge of said 

cam is provided with a bezel (71), said bezel being
outwardly oriented, i.e. oriented away from the element

to which the cam is fixed, and designed to act on the
inclined surface (72) of the tooth (64) of the tab,

thereby causing the elastic deformation and release of
said tab.
Improvements to cyclic image viewers according
to claim 10, characterized in that the opening of the

stepped rebate (69) of the cam (66) through which the
toothed tab (63) enters is widened to make said entrance

easier.
Improvements to cyclic image viewers according
to claims 10 to 11, characterized in that the axis of

rotation (67) of the cam (66) is positioned on the viewer

in which the edge of said cam where the opening
leading to the stepped rebate (69) and the bezel (71) are

located is parallel to the free end of the toothed tab
(63), the cam is a short distance away from said toothed

tab and, from this intermediate position, if the cam is
rotated in one direction it causes the toothed tab (63)

to be clamped to the viewer (1), and if it is rotated in
the other direction it causes said tab (63) to be

elastically deformed sufficiently to release it.
