<DESCRIPTION>
Plasma-induced polymerization and surface 
modification is a relatively young technical discipline 
that has the capability of modifying surface properties 
and generating thin polymer-like films on substrates. 
Typical applications relate to the preparation of composite 
gas-permselective membranes by forming a permselective 
film on a polymeric substrate such as a flat 
sheet, a tube or a hollow fiber. See, for example, U.S. 
patent Nos. 4,410,338, 4,483,901, 4,533,369, 4,696,686 
and 4,824,444. None of these patents however disclose a 
process for coating the inside of very small (≦2 mm) 
diameter tubular substrates such as hollow fibers, which 
are very desirable in separation applications because of 
their ease of fabrication, their durability and the 
ability to achieve commercially useful surface areas in 
separation devices with them. An inside coating or modified 
lumen surface is generally desirable as it allows 
protection of the fairly fragile coating or modified 
surface while still leaving it accessible to contact with 
fluids, which is particularly desirable in vascular prosthesis 
applications. Hoffman et al., in ASTM SpecialPublication No. 898, pp. 137-155 (1986), disclose the 
preparation of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) graft 
coating on the inside of Dacron® vascular prostheses 
comprising hollow fibers 4 to 5 mm inside diameter (ID). 
Matzuzawa et al., in 38 J. Appl. Polym. Sci: Appl. Polym. Symp. 
65 (1984), disclose plasma polymerization coating 
of very thin layers (0.01-0.05 micron) of PTFE and 
poly(hexafluoroethane) on the inside of hollow silastic 
tubing having an ID of 3.3 mm at low monomer gas feed 
rates and pressures and low glow discharge radio 
frequency (RF) powers of 10 to 25 watts.  The general consensus in the art has been that 
it is impossible to coat or modify the lumen surface of 
very small diameter (<3.3 mm ID) hollow substrates by a 
plasma process because known apparatus and conditions 
have not been capable of sustaining a plasma within such 
small spaces. In the context of this invention, plasma 
is a body of partially ionized gas that comprises gas 
atoms and molecules in the ground state, electrons, and 
"excited species." "Excited species" may be broadly 
defined as ions of either polarity, gas atoms or molecules 
in higher forms of excitation, and light quanta. 
To generate and sustain a plasma that is useful for 
plasma-induced surface modification, or for preparing 
plasma polymer coatings, a suitable power source (such as 
an electrical

of from about 200 to about 5000 millitorr; 
and 
(e) generating and sustaining a plasma in the 
interior of said at least one hollow fiber

The process of claim 1 wherein step (e) is 
conducted through electrodes within said reactor.
