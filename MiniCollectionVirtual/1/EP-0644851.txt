A hoisting device with a horizontally movable 
construction part (1, 1', 1") and a load-bearing means 

(4) which may be raised and lowered relative thereto 
and which is suspended from the construction part via 

elements capable of bearing tensile force and may be 
rigidly connected to a load, characterised in that the 

elements capable of bearing tensile force are formed 
from at least six hydraulic adjusting cylinders (11 to 

16; 41, ...; 51, ...), which may be individually 
varied in length and are mounted via a respective 

spatially movable pivot (21 to 26 and 31 to 36; 59, 
60) on the construction part (1; 1'; 1") and on the 

load-bearing means (4), wherein at least four 
adjusting cylinders (11 to 16; 41 to 44; 55 to 58) are 

arranged on an incline. 
Hoisting device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that six adjusting cylinders (11 to 16) are provided; 

that the pivots (21 to 26 or 31 to 36) of the 
adjusting cylinders are arranged on a theoretical 

circle (20 or 30) both on the movable construction 
part (1) and on the load-bearing means (4); that the 

angle between the n-th pivot and the (n+2)-th pivot 
(21/23, ... or 31/33,...) amounts to 120°; that the 

angle between two directly consecutive pivots (21/22, 
22/23, ... and 32/33, 33/34, ...) alternately amounts 

to 60° to 120°, preferably 90° to 120°, and 0° to 60°, 
preferably 0° to 30°; and that the centres of each two 

directly consecutive pivots (22/23, ...) on the 
movable construction part (1) and the centres of each 

of two adjacent pivots (31/32, ...) on the load-bearing 
means (4) - as viewed from the top - are  

 
offset by 60° relative to one another with equal 

effective length of the adjusting cylinders (11 to 
16). 
Hoisting device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the theoretical circle (30) on 

which the adjusting cylinders (11 to 16; 41 to 46) are 
pivoted to the load-bearing means (4) has a smaller 

diameter than the theoretical circle (20) on which the 
adjusting cylinders are pivoted to the movable 

construction part (1; 1'). 
Hoisting device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that eight adjusting cylinders (51 to 54, 55 to 58) 

are provided, of which four (51 to 54) - in the case 
of purely vertical load application - are arranged 

vertically and are located at the corners of a 
theoretical rectangle - as viewed from the top; that 

in the four theoretical planes between two respective 
adjusting cylinders (51/52, 52/53, ...), an inclined 

adjusting cylinder (55, 56,...) is located, the 
inclination of the inclined adjusting cylinders being 

opposed in two of the theoretical parallel planes. 
Hoisting device according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the rectangle formed by the vertical adjusting 

cylinders (51, 52, ...) is a square. 
Hoisting device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the adjusting cylinders (11, 

...; 41, ...; 51, ...) are pivoted with their housing 
to the movable construction part (1; 1'; 1"). 
Hoisting device according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the pivot (21 to 26; 59) of the housings is  

 
provided at its closed end. 
Hoisting device according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the pivot (21 to 26; 59) of the housings is 

provided at a point (48) remote from its closed end. 
Hoisting device according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the pivot is provided 2/3 of the length of the 

housing from the closed end and 1/3 of the length of 
the housing from the open housing end with the piston 

rod passing through it.
