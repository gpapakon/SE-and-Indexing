<ABSTRACT>
An electrohydraulic control system for an 
automatic transmission includes planetary gearsets, clutch 

and brakes that control the condition of the gear 
components, hydraulically actuated solenoid control valves, 

electronic sensors connected to a microprocessor, a gear 
selector mechanism and an overdrive cancel switch. The 

extent to which a gear ratio change is completed, as 
represented by the ratio of the current operating gear ratio 

and the gear ratio associated with gear ratio at the 
completion of the gear shift, is used as a variable in 

algorithms executed by the microprocessor to schedule change 
in state of solenoid operated valve. The state determines 

the engaged and disengaged condition of friction elements 
that produce the gear shift.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of control 
and actuation of automatic transmissions for automotive 
vehicles. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
method for controlling synchronous engagement and 
disengagement of friction elements that control operation of 
a multiple-speed transmission. When gear ratio changes are produced in an 
automatic transmission, one friction element, a clutch, 
brake or brake band, is disengaged and a second friction 
element changes from the disengaged state to the engaged 
state. The speed ratio produced by the transmission is 
changed, and the torque transmitted by the various friction 
elements changes during the gear ratio change. To avoid 
harsh gear ratio changes during synchronous gear shifts 
various techniques are used to apply torque slowly to the 
oncoming friction element and to coordinate its engagement 
with disengagement of the offgoing friction element. Attempts have been made to use electric timers to 
assure that the state of the oncoming and offgoing friction 
elements are coordinated in time and do not occur 
concurrently. However, the use of timers has produced 
unsatisfactory results because of the effect of temperature 
variations, manufacturing tolerances and differences from 
car line-to-car line, even where the same powertrain is 
employed. In an electronically controlled automatic 
transmission operating in overdrive, a downshift from the 
overdrive speed ratio to an direct drive speed ratio occurs 
when the vehicle operator depresses an overdrive cancel 
switch, thereby producing an electronic signal but without 
effecting a change of position of any component of the 
hydraulic control circuit. Formerly such gear ratio changes 
required the operator to move a gearshift lever from the 
overdrive position to the direct drive position, thereby  
 
changing the position of a manual valve in the hydraulic 
control system. The downshift produces enhanced engine 
braking. These problems are particularly important in an 
automatic transmission wherein an overdrive brake band must 
release its engagement of an overdrive brake drum before a 
forward clutch is applied in order to produce a 4-3 
downshift. If the forward clutch is applied before the 
overdrive drum is released, the output shafts of the 
transmission are locked to the transmission case. This 
action stops rotation of the drive wheels, an entirely 
unacceptable outcome. Furthermore, if the forward clutch is 
applied long after the overdrive drum is released, there 
will result a

<CLAIMS>
A method for controlling operation of a 
multiple-gear automatic transmission (10) with the aid of an 

electronic microprocessor (170), the transmission having first (92, OD Band) and 
second (94, CT1) friction elements whose engaged, disengaged and 

partially engaged states determine the gear ratio produced 
by the transmission, comprising the steps of: 


producing a first gear ratio (4th) by applying pressure 
at relatively high magnitude to the first friction element (92, OD Band); 
repetitively determining the current gear ratio 
produced by the transmission; 
commanding a gear ratio change; 
repetitively determining the gear ratio produced by 
the transmission at the completion of the gear ratio change; 
repetitively calculating a percentage of shift completion ratio (PSC) of the current 
gear ratio and the gear ratio to be produced at the 

completion of said gear ratio change, said percentage of shift completion (PSC) ratio 
representing the extent to which said gear change has been 

completed; and 
producing a first signal (208) that changes the state of 
a first solenoid-operated valve (209) and decreases pressure 

applied to the first friction element (92), thereby disengaging 
the first friction element, characterised in that this 

method further comprises; 
producing a second signal (210) that changes the state of 
a second solenoid operated valve (211) and increases pressure 

applied to the second friction element (94), thereby engaging the 
second friction element after said percentage of shift completion (PSC) ratio increases from 

substantially zero to a first predetermined magnitude; 
producing a third signal (206) that changes the state of 
a third solenoid operated valve (207), thereby pressurising the 

second friction element at relatively low magnitude after the percentage of shift completion 
(PSC) increases from substantially zero to a first 

predetermined magnitude; and  
 
increasing the magnitude of pressure applied to the 
second friction element after the percentage of shift completion (PSC) increases from said first 

predetermined magnitude to a second predetermined magnitude. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, further 
comprising:
 
   producing a third signal (206) that changes the state of 

a third solenoid operated valve (207), thereby pressurising the 
second friction element (94) at relatively low magnitude after the percentage of shift completion 

(PSC) increases from substantially zero to a first 
predetermined magnitude.
