<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a system for auxiliary information transmission over a HDLC digital link. In order to perform transmission of an original digital signal between a local point and a distant point, or vice versa, the original flag bytes are transcoded into transcoded flag bytes a) from auxiliary information in order to generate and transmit b) a transcoded digital signal. On reception, the transcoded flag bytes are decoded and interpreted c), then subjected to reverse transcoding d) in order to reconstitute the original flag bytes. The original digital signal is reconstituted and transmitted to an application e).   Application to the transmission of auxiliary data of any type, to management of the HDLC digital link, to the creation of auxiliary services.

Process for transmission of auxiliary data over a
bi-directional connection for HDLC transmission of

digital data, forming a primary channel for transmission
of a digital start signal, between a local point and a

remote point, over which connection at east one sequence
of flags is emitted in accordance with HDLC protocol, the

digital data being transmitted between two or more
successive start flags and an idle signal or a sequence

of flags being transmitted over the said primary channel
in the absence of transmission of digital data,

characterised by the fact that the said process consists
at least, at the local and/or remote point, in order to

form a secondary channel for transmission of the said
auxiliary data,


of transcoding (a) at least one of the start flags
from the said auxiliary data to be transmitted, to

generate at least one transcoded flag,
of transmitting (b) to the said remote and/or local
point over the said connection the said transcoded

flag and the said digital data, to generate a
transcoded digital signal, and at the remote and/or

local point,
of decoding (c) the said transcoded flag to restore
and interpret the said auxiliary data,
of reverse transcoding (d) the said transcoded flag,
to recreate the start flag,
of transmitting (e) the said recreated start flag
and the said digital data to recreate the said

digital start signal to a local or remote usage
point, which ensures, on the one hand, transparent

transmission of the digital data between local point
and remote point over the said primary channel, and,

on the other, transmission and interpretation of the
auxiliary data between the local point and the 

remote point, or vice versa, over the said secondary
channel.

reverse transcoding (d) of the transcoded flag are
performed on a plurality of successive fags, the said

successive flags being grouped, except during their
