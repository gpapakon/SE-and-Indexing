<ABSTRACT>
In assembling an electron gun (10), parts (11 to 18) are placed 
on supports (21) on the support base (2). The angle of a supported G3 

grid (15) can be adjusted by moving the side of the G3A grid (15A), 
because the support (21) for the G3 grid (15) holds only the rear of 

the G3B grid (15B). Accordingly, in the event the G3A grid (15A) and 
the G3B grid (15B) are welded together out of position, adjuster pins 

(5) can be inserted into the guide holes (61) of the G3A grid (15A) 
without being bent, thereby adjusting beam holes of G3A grid (15A) to 

coincide with the beam holes of other grids. Accordingly, the beading 
apparatus (1) allows the electron gun (10) to be manufactured with 

considerable precision.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a beading apparatus for attaching 
beadings to parts of an electron gun. In an electron gun for a cathode-ray tube, dimensions, relative 
positions and intervals of respective grids are manufactured with 
considerable precision in order to improve the focus function. FIG. 4 illustrates the structure of an unipotential electron gun 
10. In the electron gun 10, a pin support 11, grids 12 to 17, and a 
convergence plate 18 are arranged in a single row. Two long and slender 
beadings 20 adhere to pins 19 protruding from the sides of the 
respective parts 11 to 18. The beadings 20 hold the parts 11 to 18 
firmly together. In assembling the electron gun 10, as shown in FIG. 5, the parts 
11 to 18 are placed onto supports 21 which are set on top of a support 
base 2 for the beading apparatus 1. A first spacer 22, a second spacer 
23, and a third spacer 24, which have a predetermined thickness, 
protrude from the support base 2. The first spacer 22 is inserted 
between GM grid 14 and G3 grid 15, the second spacer 23 is inserted 
between G3 grid 15 and G4 grid 16, and the third spacer 24 is inserted 
between G4 grid 16 and G5 grid 17. Accordingly, the parts 11 to 18 can 
be fixed at predetermined intervals. Further, a stabilizing lever 3 is mounted on one of two legs 25 
rotatably by shaft 32. When pushed down, the stabilizing lever 3 is 
fixed by a clamp 4 mounted on the other leg 25 rotatably by shaft 41. 
The G5 grid 17 is fixed by holders 31 set on the lower side of the 
stabilizing lever 3 in connection with the supports 21 on the support 
base 2. Each of the parts 11 to 16 are held firmly in their proper 
positions but may be slided. Thereafter an appropriate pressing means 
(not shown) presses the pin support 11 in the direction of the G5 grid 
17. With this, parts 11 to 18 of the electron gun 10 are firmly 
manufactured at predetermined intervals. As shown in FIG. 6, two guide holes 61, being diametrically 
opposite each other, are perforated from the pin support 11 to the G3A 
grid 15A for adjusting the positions of the parts. Two adjuster pins 5 
are inserted into the guide holes 61 through the parts, so that the 
positions of the parts 11 to 15 are adjusted on opposite sides and  
 
three beam holes 62, perforated from the G1 grid 12 to the G3 grid 15A, 
coincide respectively. Therefore the electron gun 10 can emit three 
lines of electron beams precisely at a target. After the insertion of the adjuster pins 5, two beadings 20 are 
attached to the pins 19 for the parts 11 to
