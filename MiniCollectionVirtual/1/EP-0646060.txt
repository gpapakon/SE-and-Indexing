<ABSTRACT>
A laminate for lining a passage, which is entirely or partially surrounded by walls, above or under the ground, which laminate comprises at least one layer of a reinforcement (4) of continuous fibre, a curable resin (5) and a plastic sheet or plastic film (3) which is on the inside of the laminate when the laminate is inserted into the passage (10) which shall be lined. In order to give such laminates corrosion durability and flexibility which stand on a par with the strength of the laminate so that not anyone of these parameters will determine the life length of the lining, there is arranged a mat (8) of fibres between the inner film (3) and the reinforcement (4) which mat on its side which is turned to the inner film (3) has cut fibres (13), and which together with its cut fibres can absorb resin for concentration of curable resin to the inner surface of the cured laminate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminate for lining passages entirely or partially
surrounded by walls on or under the ground, for instance pipelines for a water system and/or
sewerage system, channels for instance for ventilation and smoke system and the like,
comprising at least one layer of a reinforcement of continuous fibres, curable resin and a
plastic foil or a plastic film, which is on the inside of the laminate when this one is introduced
into the passage that shall be lined.Such laminates for lining of pipelines excavated down into the ground are previously
known from for instance EP-A-0205621 and EP-A-0392026 and normally have the design of a
flexible lining hose which is either drawn into the pipeline and is then expanded against the
inside of the pipeline by means of a pressure medium or is everted into the pipeline by means
of a pressure medium, whereafter the entirely evened lining hose is kept expanded against the
inside of the pipeline by the utilized pressure medium in order to make the lining hose or the
lining laminate to be adapted to the mentioned inside, and that this pressure is maintained at
least until the resin has been cured to such extent that the lining laminate has become entirely
formstable.Utilized pressure medium normally is air and/or water and in a heated condition this
pressure medium is also utilized for carrying out or accelerating the initiating of the cure of
the resin and with the plastic material type or resin type, used most times for this purpose, the
cure generally continues in a natural way until the curing process has been completed.Due to the fact that this type of cure, i.e. heat cure, requires a plentiful equipment
and is expensive as a result of the necessary heating of utilized medium and takes a long time
to carry out, radiation energy in the form of light has lately begun to be used for curing of the
curable resin, being a part of the lining laminate, which resin is preparated in a way intended
for that with suitable curing systems, catalysts, accelerators and so on for achieving a through-cure
which is made as rapid as possible.Independently of curing ways, however, the lining laminate after the cure, i.e. when
the lining is finished, has to satisfy certain strength requirements and have a resistance to
corrosion in order to be able to manage the environments in decades it is intended for without
being destroyed in the one or the other respect and this has validity especially for such
laminates which are intended for lining sewer pipes. Such linings

<CLAIMS>
A laminate for lining passages entirely or partially surrounded by walls on or
under the ground, for instance pipelines for a water system and/or sewerage system, channels

for instance for ventilation and smoke system, comprising at least one layer of a
reinforcement (4) of continuous fibres, curable resin (5) and a plastic foil or a plastic film (3),

which is on the inside of the laminate when this one is introduced into the passage (10) that
shall be lined, 
characterized
 in that between the inner film (3) and the reinforcement
(4) there is arranged a mat (12) of fibres, which mat carries cut fibres (13) on its side turned to

the inner film (3) and forms, together with said cut fibres, a combination fabric that can
absorb some of the curable resin (5) and increase the concentration thereof at the inner surface of the

laminate so that, after curing, this inner surface is corrosion resistant.
A laminate according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the mat (12)
comprises woven or laid continous fibres, preferably glass fibres.
A laminate according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the cut fibres
(13) are glass fibres.
A laminate according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that there is arranged a layer (15) of core material between the mat (12) and reinforcement
(4), and that the core material comprises cut glass fibres or viscose polyester foam.
A laminate according to any one of the preceding claims, comprising at least two
reinforcement layers (4) 
characterized
 in that a layer (15) of core material is in
direct contact with these two reinforcement layers (4).
A laminate according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that there is arranged a mat (16) of filt on that side of the reinforcement (4) which is turned
away from the mat (12) as an isolation material.
A laminate according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that a plastic foil or a plastic film (2) is present on the side of the laminate opposite to the
side directed to the inner foil (3).
