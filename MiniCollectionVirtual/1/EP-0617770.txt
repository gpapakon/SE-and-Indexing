<ABSTRACT>
Toroidal core spring (3) made of a rubber elastic material having an at least approximately cylindrical shape. By designing a constricted section (8) in the cylinder outer surface with an axial height equal to or higher than 30 % of the total height of the spring core, the resonant frequency shift of engine bearers based on toroidal core springs made of elastic materials may be tuned. The constricted section is in particular concave toroidal, paraboloidal or hyperboloidal.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a single-aperture core spring comprising a
spring core of elastomeric material in the form an

axially symmetrical member having an at least
approximately cylindrical envelope and designed for

dynamic compressive loading in the direction of the
axis of axial symmetry via at least one bearing

connection coupled or bonded to the entire surface of
one end and an abutment connection coupled or bonded to

the entire surface of the opposite end, formed with a
central bore closed at one end or open at both ends and

coaxial with the axis of axial symmetry and comprising
an axially extending constricted portion formed between

the bearing connection and the abutment connection and
in which the spring core has a reduced diameter, the

smallest diameter thereof being less than the diameter
of at least the bearing connection or the abutment

connection, wherein the axial height of the constricted
portion is equal to or greater than 30% of the total

height of the spring core, the device being of use as
an engine bearing in motor vehicle construction.
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that
the smallest diameter of the spring core in the

constricted portion is less than the diameter of either
the bearing connection or the abutment connection.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the axial height of the constricted region is

equal to or greater than half the total height of the
spring core. 
Use according to any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the axial height of the
constricted portion is at least substantially equal to

the total height of the spring core.
Use according to any of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the axial profile of the
constricted region varies in uniform manner, more

particularly the surface in three dimensions of the
constriction is in the shape of a concave toroid,

paraboloid or hyperboloid.
Use according to any of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the smallest diameter of the
constricted region is at least substantially half way

up the total axial height of the spring core.
Use according to any of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that the spring core is a perforated
rubber member, more particularly a perforated rubber

spring member formed with ducts, or with ducts
extending through cavities.
