<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for encrypting
and decrypting images and other visual information, comprising
the steps of: creating a spatially encrypted image comprised
of a plurality of image fragments from an original image by
application of one or more image alteration methods to said
original image; and providing a multiplexing decrypting optic
and positioning said optic a predetermined distance away from
said encrypted image for visual reconstruction of said original
image by allowing the viewing of said encrypted image.Such a method is known from US-A-3,178,993, in which
an optical cryptographic device is described, comprising a screen
composed of a mosaic of lenticules. With said device, image
portions are projected through different ones of the lenticules
being optically rotated separately about the axes of the
respective lenticles, so that their relative orientations in
the final image are different from the relative orientations
of the corresponding portions of the original image. The optical
axes of these lenticules are all arranged generally parallel
to each other, in order to avoid overlap of image fragments
which leads to undesired loss of contrast during reconstitution
of the final image.It is an object of the invention to provide an improved
method for encrypting and decrypting images and other visual
information.It is a further object of this invention to provide a
novel method for combining two or more images into an encrypted
image in such a manner that each one can be separately optically
decrypted and reconstructed.It is yet another object of this invention to provide
a method for incorporating encrypted images and multiplexing
decrypting optics into a plastic bottle lable as a promotional
gaming piece and for ensuring the security thereof.It is another object of this invention to provide a method
for combining holographic image components with non-holographic
images. A further object of this invention is to provide a method
for the creation of new colors, or the modification of existing
colors, in an image by additive color processing by means of
multiplexing optics. A related object of this invention is to
provide a method for the mofication of image colors through
controlled spectral dispersion.In accomplishing the foregoing and related objects, the
invention provides a method according to the preamble of the
main claim, which is characterized by substantially reversing
the effects of said one or more image alteration methods by
optically superimposing the encrypted
