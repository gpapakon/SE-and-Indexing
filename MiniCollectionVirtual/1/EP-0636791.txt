<ABSTRACT>
A regenerative pump comprises a housing (1) an impeller (5) 
having a plurality of vanes (13) spaced angularly around the 

axis of rotation of the impeller (5) within a flow channel (4) 
extending between an inlet (19) and outlet (20), a flow 

stripper (17) located between the inlet (19) and outlet (20) 
and through which the vanes pass, a second fluid inlet (33) 

that opens into the flow channel (4) between the inlet (19) and 
outlet (20), and control means (34) to control the supply of 

fluid selectively to one or the other, or one or both of said 
fluid inlets (19,33), thereby to vary the output of the pump. 

The stripper (17) incorporates a fluid flow loop (22) which 
intersects the path of rotation of the vanes (13). The first 

fluid inlet (19) is preferably spaced downstream of the 
stripper (17), for example, within an angular range of 15° to 

90° from the fluid exit port (29) of the stripper (17), and 
preferably 45° to 75° from the exit port (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to regenerative pumps. Regenerative pumps comprise a housing with a fluid inlet and 
a fluid outlet, and an impeller rotatably mounted within the 
housing and having a plurality of vanes spaced angularly around 
the axis of rotation of the impeller and accommodated within 
a flow channel within the housing extending between the inlet 
and outlet, the vanes serving to induce a spiral or helical 
flow of fluid along the length of the flow channel as the 
impeller is rotated. The spiral flow is induced by the 
centrifugal and frictional effects of the vanes on the fluid 
and causes the fluid to be re-circulated repeatedly across a 
plurality of the vanes between the inlet and outlet, thereby 
progressively increasing the fluid pressure. A stripper block 
is located between the inlet and outlet and has sufficient 
clearance with the impeller and vanes to allow them to pass but 
to restrict direct fluid flow from the higher pressure fluid 
outlet to the lower pressure fluid inlet. In a known type of regenerative pump, an annular core is 
provided in the flow channel and the fluid flows in said spiral 
path about the core. The vanes project from the impeller into 
the flow channel and either terminate just short of a fixed 
core or are connected to the core so that the core rotates with 
the rotor. The vanes may have an aerofoil cross-section to  
 
enhance the fluid flow effects, and means may be provided to 
assist the initial spiral flow of fluid at the inlet. An 
example of such a regenerative pump is shown in British Patent 
No. 2068461. British Patent No. 2074242 discloses a regenerative pump in 
which fluid flows in a spiral path about a core between an 
inlet and outlet, and which incorporates a stripper block 
between the inlet and outlet that serves to preserve the 
annular motion of the fluid as it passes with the vanes of the 
impeller through the stripper block. This is achieved by 
providing a fluid flow loop in the stripper block which 
intersects the path of the rotation of the vanes. The fluid 
flow loop may comprise one or more closed loops each of which 
is formed by a separate duct which re-circulates the fluid 
through the vanes, or may comprise a single quasi-helical loop 
formed by a succession of ducts between the outlet and inlet 
side of the stripper block. In the latter arrangement, the 
quasi-helical flow loop serves to preserve the annular motion 
of the fluid to a maximum extent so as to maintain increased 
pump efficiency and pressure rise. Regenerative

A regenerative pump comprising a housing (1) with a 
fluid inlet (19) and a fluid outlet (20), an impeller (5) 

rotatably mounted within the housing (1) and having a plurality 
of vanes (13) spaced angularly around the axis of rotation of 

the impeller (5) and accommodated within a flow channel (4) 
within the housing (1) extending between the inlet (19) and 

outlet (20), and a flow stripper located between the inlet (19) 
and outlet (20) and through which the vanes (13) pass, 

characterised in that a second fluid inlet (33) is provided in 
the housing (1) to open into the flow channel (4) between said 

fluid inlet (19) and fluid outlet (20), and in that control 
means (34) is provided to control the supply of fluid 

selectively to one or the other, or one or both of said fluid 
inlets (19,33), thereby to vary the output of the pump. 
A pump as claimed in claim 1 in which three or more 
circumferentially spaced fluid inlets (19,42,33) are provided 

along the length of the flow channel, and the control means 
(34) controls the supply of fluid to these inlets (19,42,33) 

selectively either as alternatives or in combination. 
A pump as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the 
stripper (17) is adapted to preserve the annular motion of the 

fluid as it passes through the stripper (17), and incorporates 
a fluid flow loop (22) which intersects the path of rotation 

 
of the vanes (14). 
A pump as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 in 
which the first fluid inlet (19) is spaced downstream of the 

stripper (17). 
A pump as claimed in claim 4 in which the centre of 
the first fluid inlet (19) is located within an angular range 

of 15° to 90° from a fluid exit port (29) of the stripper (17). 
A pump as claimed in claim 5 in which the first fluid 
inlet (19) is located within the angular range of 45° to 75° 

from the fluid exit port (29) of the striper (17). 
A regenerative pump comprising a housing (1) with a 
fluid inlet (19) and a fluid outlet (20), an impeller (5) 

rotatably mounted within the housing (1) and having a plurality 
of vanes (13) spaced angularly around the axis of rotation of 

the impeller (5) and accommodated within a flow channel (4) 
within the housing (1) extending between the inlet (19) and 

outlet (20), and a flow stripper (17) located between the inlet 
(19) and outlet (20) and through which the vanes (13) pass, 

characterised in that said fluid inlet (19) is spaced 
downstream of the stripper (17), thereby allowing the annular 

flow of fluid from the stripper (17) to establish itself before 
it meets the flow through the inlet (19). 
A pump as claimed in claim 7 in which the inlet (19) 
 

is located within the range 15° to 90° downstream of an exit 
port (29) of the stripper (17), 
A pump as claimed in claim 8 in which the inlet (19) 
is located within the range 45° to 75° downstream of the exit 

port (29).
