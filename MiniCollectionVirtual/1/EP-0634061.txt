<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the 
telecommunications industry. More particularly, this 
invention pertains to a miniaturized coax jack for use 
in said industry. As is commonly known in the telecommunications 
industry, high speed signal transmission rates require 
coaxial conductors. For example, so-called DS-3 signal 
rates (i.e., 44.736 megabits per second) are carried 
over coax cables. In order to permit cross-connection, line 
monitoring and line access, the industry has utilized 
so-called DSX-3 coax jack modules to permit 
interconnection, cross-connection and the like. An 
example of such a module is shown in U.S. Patent No. 
4,815,104. As shown in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 
4,815,104, the module includes internal switching 
assemblies (items 90 and 92 in said patent) which 
receive coax plugs through ports in the forward face of 
the module. The switch assemblies are connected through 
coaxial cables (items 82, 84, 86, 88) to coax connectors 
(items 74, 76, 78, 80) on the rear of the module. The 
circuit schematic of the prior art module is shown in 
Fig. 6 of U.S. Patent No. 4,815,104. The preferred 
embodiment shown in the U.S. Patent No. 4,815,104 has 
cross-connect ports on the front panel of the module as 
well as cross-connect locations on the rear end of the 
module. As indicated in U.S. Patent No. 4,815,104 
(Figs. 1 and 2), the prior art also included modules 
lacking cross-connect ports on the front of the module. 
In addition to cross-connect locations, the prior art 
modules include monitoring ports or jacks connected 
across a resistance drop to the module's internal 
transmission lines.  
 In the telecommunications industry, it is 
standard for a cross-connect system to operate at 75 
ohms. Accordingly, the prior art modules are designed 
and constructed to have a 75 ohm impedance. In the telecommunications industry, a central 
office or other location will have a substantial number 
of cross-connect modules arranged in bays. Due to the 
large volume required to house such modules and bays, it 
is becoming increasingly desirable to miniaturize DSX 
modules. Such miniaturization should permit switching, 
access and monitoring functions while maintaining 
desired impedance levels. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a miniaturized DSX-3 jack module. According to 
the present invention, this 
object is achieved by providing a coax jack module 
having first and second coax conductors. A first 
conductive spring contact is biased into electrical 
contact with the
