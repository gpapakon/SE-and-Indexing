<DESCRIPTION>
 SELECTIVE CALL RECEIVER WITH A UNIVERSAL SYNCHRONIZATION CODE OPERATING MODEField of the InventionThis invention relates in general to selective call receivers, and in particular to a method and apparatus for receiving selective call signals having a plurality of synchronization code operating modes.Background of the InventionSelective call receivers are radio frequency (RF) receivers which selectively receive messages. Selective call messages are recovered from a selective call transmission by demodulating and decoding a selective call signal broadcast by a selective call network. Selective call signalling networks typically utilizes a binary frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation signalling protocol such as the POCSAG signalling code. POCSAG is a signalling protocol originally proposed by British Telecom and an anagram for the Post Office Code Standardization Advisory Group.A POCSAG signal comprises a preamble having a number of zero-to-one transitions. The POCSAG protocol receivers perform bit synchronization on the transitions of the preamble. Bit synchronization is a process used to determine the presence of bit boundaries of a data transmission having bits transmitted at a predetermined baud rate, and thereafter to provide a clock to synchronously sample the bits . One method for POCSAG bit synchronization is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,506,262.The first word following the preamble in POCSAG signalling is a synchronization (sync) code word which is defined to contain a predetermined binary sequence used for frame synchronization. Frame synchronization frames the bits transmitted so that the data transmitted is in a 

form to be decoded, thereby indicating various word boundaries such as the first bit of address and data signals. The predetermined binary sequence is the de ined POCSAG sync code word. Sixteen words of information, divided into eight frames, follow before the sync code is repeated. The sync code word provides a means for detection of frame synchronization. The combination of a sync code and the eight frames following is referred to as a batch. If no frame synchronization has been detected within a period of time substantially greater than the time to transmit sixteen words (five minutes, for example) , the POCSAG selective call receiver determines that it has lost the signal and begifis searching for the preamble in a conventional manner.If frame synchronization has been detected, the POCSAG selective call receiver looks in the following frames for its address and an associated
