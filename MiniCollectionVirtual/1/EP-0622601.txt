<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger includes a pair of tanks (2, 3) spaced 
from each other and a plurality of parallel heat transfer tubes 

(6, 16) fluidly connected between the pair of tanks (2, 3). 
Each tube (6, 16) has end portions (6b, 16b) inserted into holes 

(2a, 3a) disposed in the tanks (2, 3). The end portions (6b, 
16b) of each tube (6, 16) have a maximum diameter which is 

smaller than a central diameter of a central portion of the tube 
(6, 16). At least one of the end portions (6b, 16b) comprises 

a straight portion (6c, 16c) having the maximum diameter and a 
tapered portion (6d, 16d) extending from the straight portion 

(6c, 16c) with a tapering diameter gradually decreasing from 
the maximum diameter. Manufacturing this heat exchanger is 

easier because the tubes (6, 16) are easily inserted into the 
holes (2a, 3a) of the tanks (2, 3). Further, effective brazing 

between the tubes (6, 16) and the tanks (2, 3) may be achieved 
by the structure of the tube end portions (6b, 16b) having the 

straight portions (6c, 16c) and the tapered portions (6d, 16d) 
even if the length of the tubes (6, 16) vary slightly due to 

warping or improper manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat exchanger suitable 
for use in an air conditioning system for vehicles, and more 
particularly to improved end portions for heat transfer tubes 
in heat exchangers. Figs. 5-7 depict a conventional heat exchanger for use in 
an air conditioning system for vehicles. In Figs. 5 and 6, a 
heat exchanger 21 comprises a pair of tanks 22 and 23. Inlet 
pipe 24 and outlet pipe 25 are connected to tank 22. A 
plurality of heat transfer tubes 26 (for example, refrigerant 
tubes) are fluidly connected between tanks 22 and 23. Each 
tube 26 has a central portion 26a and end portions 26b having 
diameters which are smaller than the diameter of central 
portion 26a. End portions 26b are inserted into holes 22a and 
23a disposed in tanks 22 and 23, respectively, and fixed to 
tanks 22 and 23 by brazing. A partition 27 is provided in tank 
22 at a center portion thereof. A heat medium, for example, 
refrigerant, flows from inlet pipe 24 to outlet pipe 25 through 
the interior of tank 22, down heat transfer tubes 26, through 
the interior of tank 23, up heat transfer tubes 26 and through 
the interior of tank 22, as shown by arrows in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 depicts the structure of the connection between end 
portion 26b of each heat transfer tube 26 and tank 22 or 23. 
End portion 26b extends straight through tank 22 (23) and has a  
 
substantially uniform diameter which is smaller than the 
diameter of central portion 26a. End portion 26b is inserted 
through hole 22a (23a) and fixed to tank 22 (23) by brazing, 
welding, gluing or the like between the periphery of end portion 
26b and the inner edge of hole 22a (23a). Gap A between the 
periphery of end portion 26b and the inner edge of hole 22a 
(23a) generally has a relatively small width, for example, not 
more than about 0.2 mm (0.008 in), so that a sufficiently thick 
layer of brazing material may be extended to uniformly cover 
end portion 26b. Other connecting methods such as gluing or 
welding may also be used. In such a case, the width of gap A 
is also relatively small, for example, not more than about 0.2 
mm (0.008 in). Specifically, if the width of gap A is greater 
than about 0.2 mm (0.008 in), it is difficult to provide a 
sufficient amount of brazing material in the gap to enable 
proper brazing to occur. Providing end portions 26b as straight portions, however, 
presents difficulties in the manufacturing of the heat 
exchanger. Because the end portions 26b are straight and have a 
diameter which is only slightly less
