<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of assay of encephalopathies 
in humans and animals. The term "encephalopathy" is used herein 
to refer to neurodegenerative diseases implicating prions such 
as scrapie, in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
(BSE) in cattle, mink and cats and Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease 
(CJD), Gerstmann-Stra√ºssler-Scheinker Syndrome (GSS) and kuru in 
humans. The term "assay" is used herein to cover mere detection 
(the likely ordinary use envisaged) and a quantitative or 
semi-quantitative procedure in which some estimate is made of 
the amount of the DNA present in the sample. The state of knowledge of the causative agent of 
encaphalopathies has been summarised recently by N. Hunter, TINS 
14 (9), 389-390 (1991) and by S. B. Prusiner, M. Torcha and 
D. Westaway, Cornell Veterinarian 81 (2), 85-101 (1991). The infectious agent is a particle which differs from a 
virion and has been termed a "prion". Prions are thought to 
contain little or no nucleic acid and are composed largely of 
protease-resistant protein (PrP), which is encoded by a cellular 
gene of the host. This feature distinguishes prions sharply 
from virions. To date, no prion-specific nucleic acid has been 
identified which is required for transmission of disease. Virus-like tubulofilamentous particles 23-26 nm in diameter 
have been seen consistently in the brains of all known 
spongiform encephalopathies. These particles have been 
investigated by H. K. Narang, Intervirology 32, 185-192 (1991) 
and H. K. Narang, D. M. Asher and D. C. Gajdusek, Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. USA 85, 3575-3579 (1988) and 84, 7730-7734 (1987). 
They have a core of prions in a rod-like form. The prion rods 
are also termed scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF). Over the core  
 
is a layer of DNA, removable by DNAse and above that lies an 
outer protein coat which is digestible by a protease. In the 
Intervirology paper it is noted that no evidence as yet supports 
the existence of scrapie-specific nucleic acid, but it will be 
important to purify tubulofilamentous particles in order to 
characterise the nucleic acid and determine its relationship to 
the disease. Very recently H. K. Narang, N. S. Millar, 
D. M. Asher and D. C. Gajdusek, Intervirology 32, 316-324 
(1991), have reported an increase in multimeric mitochondrial 
DNA in the brain of scrapie-infected hamsters, but, again, 
stated that there was no evidence for a scrapie-specific nucleic 
acid. In their review entitled "The Search for Scrapie Agent 
Nucleic Acid", J. M. Aiken
