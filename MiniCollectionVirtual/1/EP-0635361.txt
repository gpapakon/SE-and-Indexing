<ABSTRACT>
A heat-sensitive stencil production device capable of 
obtaining both quality stamps without excessive soaking by 

a stencil plate and quality print without whitened-out 
areas by a heat-sensitive recording sheet. A sheet distinction 

switch determines whether a stencil plate (120) or a 
heat-sensitive recording sheet (200) has been inserted (24) into the 

stencil production device (12). When a stencil plate is detected, 
a first control mode is set and the transport/head 

pressing motor and a thermal head are driven so that a 
corresponding appropriate image is formed on the heat-sensitive 

stencil sheet of the stencil plate in a mirror 
image. When a heat-sensitive recording sheet is detected, 

a second mode is selected and the transport/head pressing 
motor and the thermal head are driven so that a corresponding 

appropriate image is formed on the heat-sensitive 
recording sheet by printing dot data of the inputted image 

from the tail end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
device for forming dot images in a heat sensitive image
recording medium. More particularly, the invention relates
to a heat-sensitive stencil-producing device for forming in
a heat-sensitive stencil sheet perforated dot images such
as marks and characters for transcribing to on an image-receiving
sheet and also for forming in a heat-sensitive
image recording sheet a printed dot image.A stencil plate generally includes a heat-sensitive
stencil sheet and an ink-impregnated body that is impregnated
with ink, the latter being covered by the heat-sensitive
stencil sheet. The heat-sensitive stencil-producing
device includes a heating device for thermally
perforating the heat-sensitive stencil sheet of the stencil
plate, and a transport device for providing relative
movement between the stencil plate and the heating device.There has been known a conventional device of this
type wherein the stencil plate is inserted in a heat-sensitive
stencil-producing device. The heat-sensitive
stencil sheet is transported by a motor and has a stencil
made therein (i.e., is thermally perforated) by a thermal
head. The stencil is a mirror image. This stencil plate 
is attached to a stamp block and pressed on a print sheet
using the stamp block. This forces the ink in the ink-impregnated
body through the perforations of the stencil
formed in the heat-sensitive stencil sheet.The present inventor has been engaging in inhouse R &
D activities with respect to a heat-sensitive stencil
production device. One of the inventions is the device
that uses the thermal head and the motor in order to form a
positive image on a heat-sensitive recording sheet in order
to confirm what the mirror image of the stencil will look
like stamped on the print sheet. Such device is described
in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. HEI-5-330220
published on December 14, 1993.The heat-sensitive recording sheet has other uses in
addition to the one explained above. For example, it can
be attached to the back surface of a completed stencil
plate to identify the image of the stencil plate or can be
used as a label on a file, thereby increasing the importance
of how well the positive image is printed on the
heat-sensitive recording sheet.After the heat-sensitive stencil sheet of the stencil
plate is thermally perforated with the mirror image using
the thermal head, when the stencil plate is attached to the
stamp block with the stencil sheet facing downward and 
stamped on a print sheet, it is known that the
