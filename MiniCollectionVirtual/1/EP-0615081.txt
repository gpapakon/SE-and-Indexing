<ABSTRACT>
An electrically actuated shifting mechanism (10) 
includes a reversible rail select electric motor (34) and a 

reversible in-gear electric motor (36). Three groups of 
switches (64, 66, 68) are provided to effect one-at-a-time 

operation of the motors (34, 36) with a center group of 
switches (66) being used to effect operation of either the 

rail select or the in-gear motor and to determine the 
direction of operation of the motor. In one embodiment of 

the invention, the motor control circuitry also controls 
the operation of a main clutch motork (168). Four groups 

of switches (64a, 66a, 68a, 166) are used to effect 
operation of the in-gear, rail select and clutch motors 

(34a, 36a, 168) in desired directions. Pulse width 
modulation (128a) is used to effect simultaneous and out-of-phase 

operation of the in-gear and main clutch motors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an electrically actuated shifting mechanism for controlling the
shifting of gears in a transmission and
more
specifically to controlling the operation of a plurality of
electric motors comprised therein.A known shifting mechanism for use in association with
a vehicle transmission is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,873,881 issued October 17, 1989 and entitled
"Electrically Actuated X-Y Shifting Mechanism". This
shifting mechanism is easily connectable to and is
compatible with shift bar housing assemblies of normally
manually actuated mechanical transmissions without
modification thereto. The shift mechanism provides for
automatic or semi-automatic shifting of the otherwise
substantially standard, normally manually shifted,
transmission. This known shifting mechanism includes a
rail select electric motor which is used to select a
desired shift rail and an in-gear electric motor which is 
utilized to effect movement of the shift rail to engage or
disengage a jaw clutch associated with the selected shift
rail.A transmission control apparatus for a comparable shifting
mechanism according to the features defined in the preamble
of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 373 273 ; it comprises an electrical circuitry for controlling the operation
of the rail select and the in-gear electric motors. It
includes a control circuitry having four switches
for each electric motor. Two of the control switches
associated with an electric motor are used to effect
forward operation of the electric motor. The other two
switches associated with the electric motor are used to
effect reverse operation of the motor. Switches used to
control the operation of either motor must be capable of
conducting relatively large currents required to energize
the motor. EP-A-0 373 273 further includes
detecting means for detecting the speed of rotation of an electric motor of a selecting
actuator and learning means for learning angular positions of the motor which
correspond respectively to gear selecting positions based on a detected signal from the
detecting means. Gear selecting operation of the selecting actuator is controlled by the
learned angular positions of the motor.The present invention which is defined in Claim 1 provides
an electrically actuated shifting mechanism comprising a motor control
circuitry for controlling the operation of a plurality of electric motors with a minimal
number of switches.
The shift mechanism may include a shift
member which is movable to select one shift rail of a plurality of shift
