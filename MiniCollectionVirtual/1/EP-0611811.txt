<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording liquid.
More particularly, it relates to a recording liquid suitable
for ink-jet recording.The so-called ink-jet recording method has come into
practical use in which droplets of a recording liquid
containing a water-soluble colorant, e.g., a direct dye or an
acid dye, are issued from a minute ejection orifice to
conduct recording.With respect to the recording liquid, it is required
not only to be stably ejectable over a long time period and
to rapidly fix to recording papers for general business use,
e.g., paper for PPCs (plain-paper copiers) such as
electrophotographic paper, and fanfold paper (continuous
paper for computers, etc.), to give a print in which the
printed characters are of good quality, that is, the printed
characters are free of blurring and have clear contours, but
also to be excellent in storage stability of the recording
liquid. Therefore, solvents usable in the recording liquid
are severely restricted.With respect to colorants for the recording liquid,
on the other hand, they are required, for example, not only
to have sufficient solubility in the solvents that are 
restricted as described above to thereby enable the recording
liquid to be stably ejected over a long time period and be
stable even in long-term storage and to give printed images
having high density and excellent water resistance and light
resistance, but also to be produced easily and free from any
problem in safety. However, it has been difficult to satisfy
these many requirements simultaneously.Although various techniques (e.g., JP-A-55-144067,
JP-A-55-152747, JP-A-57-207660, JP-A-58-147470,
JP-A-62-190269, JP-A-62-190271, JP-A-62-190272,
JP-A-62-250082, JP-A-62-246975, JP-A-62-257971,
JP-A-62-288659, JP-A-63-8463, JP-A-63-22867, JP-A-63-22874,
JP-A-63-30567, JP-A-63-33484, JP-A-63-63764, JP-A-63-105079,
JP-A-64-31877, JP-A-1-93389, JP-A-1-210464, JP-A-2-140270,
JP-A-3-167270, JP-A-3-200882, etc.) have hence been proposed,
a colorant has not been developed which sufficiently meets
the performance requirements of the market and is easy to
produce. (The term "JP-A" used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application.)An object of the present invention is to provide a
black recording liquid which is good in print quality when
used in ink-jet recording, writing, etc. to conduct recording
on plain paper, and which gives recorded images having high
density and excellent in light resistance and, in particular, 
in water resistance and color tone of
