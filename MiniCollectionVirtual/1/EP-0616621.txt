<DESCRIPTION>
Billions of pounds of thermoplastic polymers are 
used annually in the world for producing fibers, films, 
shaped articles, bottles, etc. Disposal of these 
polymeric materials by incineration or by placing them 
in land fills is becoming unacceptable due largely to 
the ever-increasing environmental impact. Recycling 
offers many advantages from an environmental standpoint; 
however, efforts so far have been hampered by the lack 
of fast, convenient, and economically attractive methods 
for identification and separation (sorting) of the 
various thermoplastic polymers currently available in 
the marketplace, and hence ending up in landfills. It 
has been estimated that plastics comprise 7.3 percent by 
weight of all municipal solid waste, of which only about 
1 percent is currently recycled (U.S. Congress, Office 
of Technology Assessment "Facing America's Trash: What 
Next for Municipal Solid Waste", OTA-0-424 (Washington, 
D.C.; U.S. Government Printing Office, October, 1989)). 
Visual identification and manual separation techniques 
presently used for sorting and separation of plastics 
are labor intensive and expensive in addition to being 
subject to human error. Efforts to use some inherent 
physical property of the plastics such as density for  
 
identification and separation have thus far not proven 
to be attractive. To allow plastics to become truly 
recyclable, plastic compositions which have unique 
properties which allow them to be separated from each 
other by automated methods, as opposed to manual separation, 
are thus very desirable. It is known (U.S. Patent 4,540,595) that one may 
mark documents such as bank checks by the use of inks 
that fluoresce in the near infrared region , i.e., 
generally between 650 and 800 nm, for automatic 
identification. Fluorescent phenoxazine dyes of the 
formula 
 
wherein R1 and R are alkyl and X- is an anion are shown 
to be effective near-infrared fluorescing compounds for 
this purpose. Attempts to use these compounds for 
adding to thermoplastics to impart fluorescence in the 
near infrared have failed because the high temperatures 
necessary for the preparation and processing of thermoplastics 
cause decomposition of the phenoxazine 
compounds. A method for separation of magnesium bearing ore 
particles based on the presence of a fluorescent 
compound, i.e., 8-hydroxyquinoline, is known (U.S. 
Patent 4,423,814). The conditioned ore is irradiated 
with UV light to induce fluorescence and the magnesium-rich 
mineral separated from the lean ore
