<ABSTRACT>
Method of production for lateral bipolar transistors, in which a highly doped collector zone (8) is produced by using a mask in the silicon layer of a SOI substrate, which silicon layer is provided with primary doping, then a structured dielectric layer (10) covering at least this collector zone (8) is applied, which dielectric layer leaves the region intended for the emitter and base free, this region left free is redoped, then an auxiliary layer (11) is applied over the entire surface with uniform thickness (d1), doping for an emitter zone (7) is introduced with the use of this auxiliary layer (11) as a shield for the base zone (9) to be produced and the emitter, base and collector are subsequently provided with contacts.
