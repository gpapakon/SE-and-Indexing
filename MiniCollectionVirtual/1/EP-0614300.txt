<ABSTRACT>
The receiver has a weighting circuit for weighting the in-phase and quadrature components of the received signal with respective coefficients dependent on the quadrature error of the demodulated components. A correction stage (KS) provides a correction value (~uE) for the quadrature error by evaluation of the in-phase and quadrature components formed by the gradients of the quadratic decision errors (eI, eQ).

QAM receiver having first circuit means (QFK),
which weight the in-phase and quadrature signal

components of a received QAM (quadrature amplitude
modulated) signal with coefficients which depend on the

quadrature error of the QAM signal components
demodulated in the receiver, and having second circuit

means (KS), which derive a correction value (
) for
the quadrature error from decision unit errors (e
I
, e
Q
)
resulting from the deviation of the in-phase and

quadrature signal values decided by decision units (E
I
,
E
Q
) with respect to the in-phase and quadrature signal
values fed to the decision units (E
I
, E

circuit means (QTK), characterized in that the second

circuit means (KS) form the gradient of the quadratic
decision unit error (e
