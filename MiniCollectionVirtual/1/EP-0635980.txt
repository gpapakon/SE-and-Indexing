<ABSTRACT>
A broadcast reception apparatus can detect a changed 
reception channel without using an extra memory. A signal from an 

aerial (1) is supplied to a tuner (2) which is connected to a reception 
channel preset means (3) and a channel setting means (4). A signal 

received by the tuner (2) is supplied to a PDC decoder (6) and a 
decoded television programme ID is supplied to a control microcomputer 

(7). A network code in the television programme ID is supplied to a 
comparator (72), and a network code provided when LUF = "1" is detected 

is supplied to a memory (73). Compared results are supplied to a 
controller (74) which sequentially outputs a channel selection control 

signal to the channel setting means (4) if the compared results do not 
agree. If the compared results agree, a signal representing the 

reception channel provided at that time is supplied to a television 
programme reserve circuit (71). A signal from the television programme 

reserve circuit (71) is supplied to a recording circuit (8), whereby a 
video signal from the tuner (2) or the like is recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to broadcast reception apparatus
and methods for receiving a broadcast signal into which a programme ID
(identification) code, such as a PDC (programme delivery control) code,
is inserted.In order smoothly to implement timer-activated recording (or
reserve recording) by a VCR (video cassette recorder), for example,
services for superimposing an ID (identification) code of a present
television broadcasting programme in a part of a particular horizontal
scanning line of a blanking period of a video signal or a teletext
signal are now commercially available in a part of areas in European
countries.In a so-called PDC (programme delivery control) system
implemented in the U.K. and the Netherlands, a code signal is provided
on a part of a teletext broadcast. Then, a predetermined programme ID
called a label is determined in every broadcasting programme by using
such code signal.When a broadcasting time of the programme, for example, is
extended, the programme ID is continued so long as the programme is
continued. Therefore, when such programme is recorded by a VCR, the
recording can be continued by detecting the programme ID so long as the
programme being recorded is extended.As shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings, the programme ID
(called a label in the PDC system) includes a broadcast day, a
broadcast start time and network codes of broadcast channels. In the
example shown in FIG. 1, a television programme 1 of the broadcast
channel of the network code BB1 is scheduled to be broadcast from 7:00
and a television programme 2 is scheduled to be broadcast as television
broadcast schedules on 10th of November. In that case, the television
programme ID is set to [11/10 7:00 BBC1] for the television programme
1 and [11/10 9:00 BBC1] for the television programme 2.If the broadcast of the television programme 1 is extended as
shown in FIG. 1A, for example, the television programme ID [11/10 7:00
BBC1] is continued during the extended period of the television
programme 1 as shown in FIG. 1B. Accordingly, when the television
programme 1 is reserved, for example, the recording of the television 
programme 1 is continued to the end thereof as shown in FIG. 1C by
controlling the recording of the VCR on the basis of the detected
television programme ID. If the television programme 2 is reserved,
then, as shown in FIG. 1D, the recording is started when the television
programme 1 has ended and the television programme 2 has started.In this way, even when the broadcast time of the

<CLAIMS>
A video recorder apparatus comprising:

a tuner (2) for receiving broadcast signals into which predetermined television
programme labels are inserted, the labels including network codes;
tuner preset means (3) having storage locations for storing data for setting the
tuner (2) to respective networks, the said data being randomly assignable to the

locations;
detecting means (6) for detecting at least network codes of the received
signals;
memory means (73) for storing the network code of the programme label of
a television programme desired to be received;
comparing means (72) for comparing the network code of a detected network
code with the stored network code;
means (4) for selecting the storage locations of the preset means (3); and
control means (7) for controlling said video recorder apparatus such that, when
the compared network codes differ, preset locations in said preset means (3) are

sequentially selected by said selecting means (4) and the network code of the label of
the signal received for each preset location is compared in the comparing means (72)

with the stored network code, and the one of the preset locations for which the
compared network codes match is thereby determined.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the control means (7) includes means
(75) for counting the number of sequential comparisons performed by the comparing

means (72), comparisons being terminated at a predetermined count.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a programme label may indicate
(LUF=1) a new network code for a desired programme, and the control means (7)

causes the new network code to be stored in the memory means (73) when the
detecting means detects a label indicating the change.
Apparatus according to claim 3, in which the label includes a flag (LUF) 
indicating whether (LUF=1) or not (LUF=0) there is a change of network code for

a desired programme,

and when the detecting mean (6) detects the flag (LUF=1) indicating the
change of network code,
the network code of the said label having the flag (LUF=1) indicating the
change is stored in the memory means (73).
