<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a system for maintaining processing continuity between a mobile 
processing unit (26) and remotely resident applications (68). The system includes a network 

backbone (12), at least one stationary processor coupled to the backbone (12), and at least one 
transceiver (16) coupled to the backbone. The transceivers (16) are configured to communicate 

with the mobile unit (26) through a wireless medium. Mobile units intermittently 
communicate with applications The present invention employs a process that is dedicated to 

handling all communications between its associated mobile unit and applications. This process 

is responsible for the scheduling of communications sessions with the mobile unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to establishing and maintaining connections among
various computers and, in particular, to maintaining communication and processing
connections to mobile computers in a wireless network.An alternative paradigm to personal computing considers integrating computers, of varying
size and power, in large numbers into a typical office environment. The integration of these
computers could be achieved "ubiquitously" in such a way that the inhabitants of such an
environment would not notice the existence of these computers. in his article, "The Computer
for the 21st Century", (Scientific American, September 1991 issue), Dr. Mark Weiser describes a
"ubiquitous computing" work place in which there would be literally hundreds of computers
per room. These computers would provide a level of functionality that no single personal
computer provides today.In Weiser's work space, this integration forms a hierarchy in terms of size and performance. At
the lowest end, "tabs", typically only a few inches square, are the smallest components of
ubiquitous computing. Tabs would perform basic functions in a ubiquitous setting. For
example, tabs have been used as "active badges" that are worn by people inhabiting this
environment. As a wearer of this badge walks from room to room, the badge would
communicate to the room, through a wireless medium, the presence of the wearer.
Automatically, the room might make adjustments for the individual, such as dimming lights,
adjusting room temperature, and the like. Additionally, the building itself could keep account
of an individual's movements. Phone calls could be forwarded to the room where the
individual is located. Likewise, security doors would open up for a certain individuals and not
for others.Some wireless networks have already been designed for the office place. For example, in U.S.-A-5,210,753
issued to Natarajan on May 11, 1993, entitled "Robust Scheduling Mechanism for
Efficient Band-Width Usage in Multicell Wireless Local Networks", Natarajan discloses a
method for partitioning transceiver nodes into maximally independent sets of non-interfering
nodes for efficient scheduling of transmission.In U.S.-A-5,212,806, issued to Natarajan on May 18, 1993, entitled "Distributed Control
Methods for Management of Migrating Data Stations in a Wireless Communications Network",
Natarajan discloses a method of handing off communication ownership of mobile units as they
cross node/cell boundaries. These above-mentioned patents are generally

<CLAIMS>
A system for maintaining processing continuity in a network (12) having a
network accessible application (68) and a mobile unit intermitt
ently connected
through wireless links to the network, the system comprising:


a mobile unit having a mobile transceiver (26) for wireless communication with
the network,
a stationary transceiver (16) connected to the network for wireless
communication with the mobile unit,
a gateway (60) for controlling the stationary transceiver, the gateway being
connected to the network,
a stationary processor (74, 76, 78) connected to the gateway and configured to
support access to the network accessible application (18) from the mobile unit,

said system being 
characterised by
:

an agent (64) dedicated to communication and processing control of the mobile
unit, the agent running on the stationary processor and connected to the

gateway for handling communications between the mobile unit and the network
accessible application, with the agent configured to hold data received from the

network accessible application for transmission to the mobile unit when the
mobile unit is in wireless communication with the network.
The system of claim 1, wherein the stationary processor runs both the network
accessible application (68) and the agent (64).
The system of claim 1, wherein the stationary processor runs the agent (64) and
is connected by the network to a second stationary processor that runs the

network accessible application. 
The system of claim 1, wherein the agent (64) further comprises a module for
preventing communication between an unauthorised network accessible

application and the mobile unit.
The system of claim 1, wherein the agent further comprises a module for
scheduling communication access between a plurality of network accessible

applications and the mobile unit.
The system of claim 1, wherein the agent further comprises a module for
resolving contentious access requests between a plurality of network accessible

applications and the mobile unit.
A method for maintaining processing continuity in a network (12) having a
network accessible application (68) and a mobile unit intermittently connected
