<ABSTRACT>
A non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary cell having a 
negative electrode formed of a carbon material capable of being 

doped with and releasing lithium, a positive electrode, and a 
non-aqueous liquid electrolyte having an electrolyte dissolved 

in a non-aqueous solvent, is disclosed. This cell contains 
pyrocarbonate having the formula (ROCO)₂O, wherein R is an alkyl 

group selected from the group consisting of CH₃, C₂H₅ and C₃H₇. If 
the pyrocarbonate is mixed with other non-aqueous solvent(s), the 

proportion of the pyrocarbonate in the non-aqueous solvent is not 
less than 25 vol%. The non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary 

cell is capable of withstanding charging/discharging cycles at 
high charging voltages, while exhibiting satisfactory 

charging/discharging cyclic performance under high temperature environment 
and superior discharging performance under low-temperature 

environment and heavy loads.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte 
secondary cell employing a carbon material as an active material 
of the negative electrode thereof. The non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary cell, employing 
a negative electrode of metal lithium and a liquid electrolyte, 
that is an electrolyte dissolved in a non-aqueous solvent, is low 
in self-discharge and superior in the operating voltage and 
storage properties, so that it may be used as a cell for 
prolonged time with high reliability. Thus it is extensively 
employed for timepiece or as a memory backup power source. The non-aqueous liquid electrolyte cell, so far used as the 
power source for these devices, is unexceptionally designed as 
the primary cell. Recently, the development of portable 
equipment in the field of the electronic equipment, such as video 
cameras, small-sized audio equipment or micro-computers, is 
proceeding, and the increasing demand is raised for the secondary 
cell which is lightweight and of a larger capacity and which may 
be employed economically for a prolonged time as the power source 
for these portable devices. As the secondary cell capable of 
meeting the demand, the non-aqueous liquid electrolyte cell is 
thought to be promising, and the researches and developments are 
now proceeding towards re-designing the non-aqueous liquid  
 
electrolyte cell as the secondary cell. For example, such non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary 
cells, in which lithium, a lithium alloy or a lithium-occlusive 
material is used for the negative electrode and MnO2, TiS2, MoO3, 
MoS2, V2O5, WO3 or LiCoO2 is used for the positive electrode, have 
been proposed. Of these, the non-aqueous liquid electrolyte secondary cell, 
in which a carbon material capable of being doped with and 
releasing lithium is used for the negative electrode, and a 
lithium transition metal composite oxides, represented by the 
formula LiMxN1-xO2, where M, N represent one of Co, Ni, Mn, Cr, Fe 
or V, above all, lithium cobalt composite oxides, lithium nickel 
composite oxides or lithium manganese composite oxides, as the 
positive electrode, are thought to be highly promising because 
it is high in the operating voltage and the energy density and 
superior in cyclic performance as compared to the non-aqueous 
liquid electrolyte secondary cell employing metal lithium or 
lithium alloys for the negative electrode. For example, the non-aqueous 
liquid electrolyte secondary cell employing the lithium 
cobalt composite oxides, lithium nickel
