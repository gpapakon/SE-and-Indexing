<ABSTRACT>
A device (5a, 5b) with a mudguard (7a, 7b) and/or a luggage rack (9a, 9b) is arranged above one of the road wheels (3, 4) of a two-wheeled vehicle (1). The device (5a, 5b) can be easily and rapidly secured to the frame (13, 14) by means of a quick-release connector (11). The mudguard (7a, 7b) and the luggage rack (9a, 9b) can be secured together via a container (35). The quick-release device (11) allows a cyclist to release the device (5a, 5b) from his bicycle (1) quickly if he wishes to use the latter as a sports cycle and avoid any unnecessary air turbulences. Furthermore, when adjusting the level of the saddle, which is often desirable in sporting tourism or when the bicycle (1) is to be used by people of different heights, he can immediately alter the level of the mudguard (7a, 7b) and/or the luggage rack (9a, 9b).

<CLAIMS>
Device (5a, 5b) which can be attached to the frame 
structure (13) of a two-wheeled vehicle (1) above 

one of the running wheels (3, 4) 

characterised by
a luggage repository (9a, 9b; 81), a mudguard (7a, 
7b) and a high-speed connecting arrangement (11, 32; 

53, 55), which are constructed as structural parts 
of a structural unit, wherein 
the luggage repository (9a, 9b; 81) can be attached, 
together with the high-speed connecting arrangement 

(11, 32; 53, 55), to the frame structure (13) and 
the mudguard (7a, 7b) is attached to the luggage 
repository (9a, 9b; 81). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
the high-speed connecting arrangement (11, 32; 53, 
55) has a holding part (11; 53) having two jaws 

(17a, 17b; 63a, 63b) capable of being clamped in 
relation to one another, which holding device 
can be fitted so as to be positioned in its position 
and fixed to the frame structure (13). 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterised by
inserts (27a - c), which can be inserted in the jaws 
(17a, 17b; 63a, 63b) and are also held in the said 

jaws, when the latter are in their open condition, 
for adapting the bearing surface (29a, 29b) of the 

jaws to different cross-sectional shapes of the 
frame structure. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in 
that
the high-speed connecting arrangement (11, 32; 53, 
55) has a connecting part (32; 55),
 with the aid of 
which the holding part (11) can be connected to the 

luggage repository (9a, 9b; 81) in such a way that 
the inclination of the said luggage repository (9a, 

9b; 81) can be adjusted in relation to the point of 
attachment of the holding part (11, 53) to the frame 

structure (13). 
Device, in particular according to one of claims 1 
to 4, 
characterised by
a receptacle (35) connecting the luggage carrier 
(9a, 9b) and the mudguard (7a, 7b). 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterised by
a connecting part (55) which can be hooked into the 
holding part (53) with a folding-in movement and 

which 
connects the luggage repository (81) fixedly to the 
holding part (53). 
Device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
the holding part (53) and the connecting part (55) 
have a first pair of couplings (65, 73, 74a, 74b, 

77) which fit one another, 
the pair of couplings has one coupling part with a 
hook-in nose (77) as the folding axis and the other 

coupling part has a recess (66), which interacts 
with the said nose, as a folding axis guide, and  

 
one of the coupling parts has socket-shaped holding 

jaws (74a, 74b) for holding, sideways in relation to 
the folding axis, a plug-shaped plug-in cart (65) on 

the other coupling part. 
Device according to claim 7, 
characterised by
a pair of notching elements (69a, 69b, 80a, 80b) 
which is disposed on the coupling parts and which 
engages into the holding part (53) at the end of the 
operation of folding in the connecting part (55) and 
can be secured against disengaging with the aid of a 
gripping device which presses, in particular, the 

holding jaws (74a, 74b) against the plug-in part 
(65). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8, 

characterised by
a lamp (37a) or reflector (37b) which can be plugged 
in and is disposed on that unobstructed outer side 

of the luggage repository which is averted from the 
high-speed connecting arrangement (11, 32; 53, 55), 

which lamp or reflector can be plugged in, in 
particular by means of a second pair of couplings. 
Device according to claim 7 and 9, 
characterised in 
that
the coupling parts of the first and second pair of 
couplings are constructed so as to fit one another, 

so that the lamp (37a) or the reflector can be 
optionally slipped on, either on the luggage 

repository (9a, 9b; 81) or on the holding part (53).
