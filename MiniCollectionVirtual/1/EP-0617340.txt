mechanism (90) disposed at an upper position 

on the downstream side of a document discharge port (80). 
The document pushing-down/adjusting mechanism (90) acts on 

the rear end of the document on delivery after its rear end 
is substantially liberated from being nipped by a pair of 

document discharge rollers (86), forcibly pushes the rear 
end of the document down toward the upstream end position 

on the document-placing plate means (18), and holds the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document 
conveying apparatus of a type in which a document 
placed on a document-placing plate means is 
introduced onto a document conveying passage that 
extends along a transparent plate in a document 
processor passing through a document introduction 
passage, and is delivered onto a document-placing 
plate means from the document conveying passage 
passing through a document delivery passage. 
Particularly, the invention relates to a document 
conveying apparatus of a type in which a document 
delivered onto a document-placing plate means is 
introduced again into the document conveying passage 
passing through the document introduction passage. A document conveying apparatus of the so-called 
circulation type has heretofore been adapted 
to a document processor such as an electrostatic 
copying machine, an image reader or the like and has 
been placed in practical use. Such a document 
conveying apparatus comprises a document-placing 
plate means positioned above a transparent plate of a 
document processor; a document introduction passage 
disposed between the document-placing plate means and 
a document conveying passage that extends along the 
surface of the transparent plate; a document delivery 
passage disposed between the document conveying 
passage and the document-placing plate means; a 
document introduction means which successively 
introduces a plurality of pieces of documents placed 
in a stacked form on the document-placing plate means 
into the document conveying passage through the  
 
document introduction passage, starting with the 
document at the lowermost position; a document 
conveying means for conveying the documents through 
the document conveying passage; and a document 
delivery means which delivers the document conveyed 
from the document conveying passage onto the 
document-placing plate means through the document 
delivery passage. The plurality of documents that are to be 
copied or read out are placed, being stacked, at a 
predetermined position of the document-placing plate 
means. Among the documents stacked, the document at 
the lowermost position is first introduced into the 
document conveying passage through the document 
introduction passage and is placed at a predetermined 
position in the document conveying passage. After a 
predetermined processing is executed such as exposure 
of image to light or image reading, the document is 
delivered from the document conveying passage onto 
the document-placing plate through the
