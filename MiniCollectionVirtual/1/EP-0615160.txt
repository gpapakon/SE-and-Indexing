support and at least one silver halide emulsion layer 

provided thereon. The support is essentially composed of 
poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalate) and has Young's modulus of 

550 to 650 kg/mm² in both lengthwise direction and 
widthwise direction and breaking elongation of not less 

than 70 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic material which is particularly improved in a 
core-set curling tendency and strength. A photographic material is generally produced by 
coating one or more photographic layer (light-sensitive 
layer) on a plastic film support. As the plastic film 
support, celluloses such as triacetyl cellulose (hereinafter 
referred to as "TAC") or polyesters such as 
polyethylene terephthalate (hereinafter referred to as 
"PET") generally are employed. A photographic material is generally classified into 
two groups: a film in the form of a sheet such as an X-ray 
film, a film for photomechanical process or a cut film; and 
a film in the form of a roll such as a color or black-and-white 
film having a width of 35 mm or less which is incorporated 
into a cylindrical cartridge (patrone). The 
latter film is usually employed by charging in a camera for 
shooting. As material of a support for a roll film, TAC is 
mainly employed. The TAC has the features of a high 
transparency and no optical anisotropy, and further has a 
property of easily smoothing the curl of the film caused 
after development (easily curl-smoothing property). In contrast, when a photographic material having a 
support which has not such an easily curl-smoothing 
property (that the TAC has) is used in the form of roll, 
scratching and out-of-focusing occur during the printing  
 
step of forming an image on a photographic printing paper, 
or jamming occurs during feeding of the film in the 
printing step. The photographic materials has been developed to a 
variety of uses in these days. For instance, increase of a 
feeding speed of a photographic film in a camera per each 
shooting, increase of the image magnification and reduction 
of the size of the camera have been desired. The desired 
characteristics can be obtained by use of a support having 
a high bending strength, a good dimensional stability and a 
reduced thickness. Particularly, the reduction of the size of the camera 
or the patrone is desired. To satisfy the desire, a 
diameter of a spool around a film is wound up is required 
to be reduced. There are two problems to be solved in order to attain 
the size-reduction of the patrone:
 
   One of the problems resides in the reduction of the 
modulus of elasticity in bending (concerned with 
brittleness) with reducing the thickness of the film. The second problem resides in a strong curl tendency 
developed with elapse of time due to the reduction of the 
size of the spool (of the
