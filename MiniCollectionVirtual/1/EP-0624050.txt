<ABSTRACT>
Audio apparatus capable of playing music programs 
with desired surrounding sounds. Two sources drive two 

speakers 1 and 2 having different directivities at the same time 
or independently. The speakers 1 and 2 are mounted 

in single cabinet. A selector switch 3 
and 4 selects two sources at the same time or one source from a 

plurality of sources. A digital signal processor 5 performs a sound 
field processing. The volume ratio of the two speakers 1 and 2 having 

different directivities is set as desired or in accordance with a sound 
field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an audio apparatus
for selecting a desired source from a plurality sources
and playing the selected source. More particularly, the
present invention relates to an audio apparatus having a
function of driving speakers having different
directivities at the same time or independently by two
sources, performing a sound field processing, and
changing the volumes of two-channel speakers at the same.
time or independently.A conventional audio apparatus selects one source
from a plurality of sources by an input selector and
plays the selected source. As shown in Fig.17A, only one
musical program source is played by an R-channel speaker
and an L-channel speaker.As shown in Fig.17B, also in the case where two R-channel
speakers and two L-channel speakers are used, the
same channel signal is used for driving these speakers.In the above-described conventional audio
apparatuses, a combination of source sounds is limited 
because only one musical program source is used, being unable to play a musical program
with surrounding sounds.US-A-5,123,051 shows an audio apparatus which includes a switching means
provided with first and second selectors which each designates a respective input source
among a plurality of input sources.US-A-5,117,459 describes a sound reproduction apparatus including a loudspeaker
system having a plurality of drivers for producing audio signals in response to respective
electrical right and left stereophonic signals. A first of these drivers has a voice coil wired
and connected in circuit for producing an audio output signal representing one of the
electrical right and left stereophonic signals. A second of these drivers has a dual voice coil
wired and connected in circuit for producing an audio output signal representing a
difference between the one of the electrical right and left stereophonic signals reproduced
by the first driver and the other stereophonic signal.The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situations. It is
an object of the present invention to provide an audio apparatus having a function of driving
speakers having different directivities at the same time or independently by two sources,
performing a sound field processing.According to the invention, the above object is achieved by an audio apparatus
according to claim 1. Preferred embodiments are claimed in claims 2 to 5. According to an audio apparatus of the present
invention, it is possible to drive two speakers having
different directivities at the same time or
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An audio apparatus comprising:

L-channel speakers (1,2) including two speakers having different directivities;
R-channel speakers (1,2) including two speakers having different directivities;
switching means (3,4) for designating a plurality of sources from a plurality of
sources; and
sound field processing means (5) for processing the sound field of at least
one source sound signal designated by said switching means;
CHARACTERIZED BY

an adder (7) for adding an output of said sound field processing means to a
source sound signal other than said source sound signal processed by said

sound field processing means,

wherein a source sound signal obtained by the addition of said adder, and
source sound signals not subjected to addition drive said R-channel speakers

and said L-channel speakers independently or at the same time.
The audio apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising;

level adjusting means (8) for adjusting the levels of a source sound signal
obtained by the addition of said adder and a source sound signal not

subjected to the addition,

wherein said level adjusting means is automatically set in accordance with a
sound field pattern set by said sound field processing means, and the signals

whose levels have been set by said level adjusting means drive said
R-channel speakers and said L-channel speakers independently. 
The audio apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising;

level adjusting means (8) for adjusting the levels of a source sound signal
obtained by the addition of said adder and a source sound signal not

subjected to the addition of said adder,

wherein said level adjusting means is manually set, and the signals whose
levels have been set by said level adjusting means drive said R-channel

speakers and said L-channel speakers independently.
The audio apparatus of Claim 3, wherein the manual operation of
said level adjusting means is made invalid depending upon a particular sound

field pattern set by said sound field processing means, and the level ratio of
the source sound signals for driving said R-channel speakers and said

L-channel speakers is fixed to a predetermined level ratio.
The audio apparatus of any one of Claims 1-4, wherein said
L-channel speakers include at least one omnidirectional speaker and at least

one directional speaker and said R-channel speakers include at least one
omnidirectional speaker and at least one directional speaker.
