<ABSTRACT>
A two-part bracket to be secured to a cylindrical object 
such as a header tank for a condenser, e.g. for an automobile 

air conditioning system, comprises two parts (10, 11) each 
having a concave portion (12, 25) and a flange portion (18, 

28) and interengaging formations such as matching tongues (26, 
27) and slots (20, 21) arranged so that the two parts (10, 11) 

can be assembled with their concave portions (12, 25) together 
embracing an arc of more than 180° around a portion of the 

cylindrical object and with their flange portions (18, 28) 
lying against one another so as to resist opening of the 

region embraced by the concave portions, so that the assembled 
bracket can be slid on to the cylindrical object from one end 

and will be held thereon in a desired position by friction 
while the bracket is welded or brazed to the cylindrical 

object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to brackets adapted to be secured
to cylindrical objects, such as the header tanks of
condensers, e.g. for use in automobile air conditioning
systems.It is advantageous to be able to secure brackets to such
objects by welding or brazing, e.g. during the manufacturing
process in which the header tank is welded or brazed to a
condenser core. A problem arises in that the bracket must
normally be secured to the object by wire or a specially
designed fixture before the assembly is subjected to the
welding or brazing process, and the wire or fixture can
involve lengthy set-up times and can impede the welding
process. It may also be necessary to remove the wire or
fixture after the welding or brazing has been completed.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
bracket which will be easily assembled and can readily be
welded or brazed to a cylindrical object without the use of
additional fixing means.A first prior art document, US-A-4858861 discloses a pipe
shoe for securing to a cylindrical object, the shoe comprising
two parts each of which has a respective concave portion adapted
to embrace a portion of cylindrical object from a respective side
thereof, and interengaging formations provided on the concave
portion of the two parts of the shoe, said interengaging
formations being shaped and disposed so that in an assembled
position of the two parts, the concave portions together embrace
an arc of more than 180°. In this first prior art document,
movement to separate the two parts so as to enlarge the region
embraced by the concave portion causes the flanges to apart.Another prior art document is DE-PS-811763. The second
embodiment of this document is similar to the first prior art
document, in that movement apart of the two parts to enlarge the 
region embraced by the concave portion causes the flanges to move
apart.According to the present invention there is provided a
bracket for securing to a cylindrical object such as a header
tank for a condenser, the bracket comprising two parts each of
which has a respective concave portion adapted to embrace a
portion of the cylindrical object from a respective side thereof
and a respective flange portion extending away from the concave
portion, and interengaging formations provided on the concave
portions of the two parts of the bracket, the two parts having
an assembled position where their concave portions together
embrace an arc of more than 180° and their flange portions lie
against one another, characterised in that said

<CLAIMS>
A bracket for securing to a cylindrical object such as a
header tank for a condenser, the bracket comprising two parts

(10,11) each of which has a respective concave portion (12,25)
adapted to embrace a portion of the cylindrical object (32) from

a respective side thereof and a respective flange portion (18,28)
extending away from the concave portion, and interengaging

formations (20,21,26,27) provided on the concave portions (12,25)
of the two parts of the bracket, the two parts (10,11) having an

assembled position where their concave portions (12,25) together
embrace an arc of more than 180° and their flange portions

(18,28) lie against one another, characterised in that:-

   said interengaging portions are shaped and disposed so that
a respective one of the parts (10,11) can be moved relative the

other to enlarge the region embraced by the concave portion until
said flanges lie against one another, and further relative

movement of the parts which would enlarge said region is resisted
by the flange portions lying against one another.
A bracket according to Claim 1, wherein the interengaging
formations comprise at least one slot (20, 21) in the concave

portion (12) of a first said part (10) of the bracket and at
least one tongue (26, 27) on the other said part (11) of the

bracket adapted to be received in the slot.
A bracket according to Claim 2, wherein the free end (29,
30) of the tongue (26, 27) is adapted to lie against the

outside of the concave portion (12) of the first part (10) of
the bracket, in the assembled condition.
A bracket according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein the first
part (10) of the bracket has two of said slots (20, 21) formed

respectively in upper and lower margins (22, 23) of a terminal
section (15) of its concave portion (12), and is formed with a

substantially right-angled bend (19) between the said section 
(15) in which the slots are formed and its flange portion

(18), which extends from said section (15) of its concave
portion (12).
A bracket according to Claim 4, wherein the other part
(11) of the bracket has two of said tongues (26, 27)

respectively forming upper and lower sections of its concave
portion (25), with the flange portion (28) of said other part

(11) extending from the middle of its concave portion (25).
A bracket according to Claim 4 or 5 wherein a
strengthening boss (24) is press-formed in said first part

(10) of the bracket centrally spanning the substantially
right-angle bend (19) between its concave portion (12) and its

flange portion (18).
A bracket according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the concave portion (12, 25) of at least one part (10,

11) of the bracket is formed with apertures (33, 34) to permit
flow of welding or brazing flux and thereby facilitate welding

or brazing of the bracket to the cylindrical object (32).
