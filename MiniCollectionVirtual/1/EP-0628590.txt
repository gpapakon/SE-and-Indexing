<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an organopolysiloxane having bifunctional 
biphenyl groups of the formula I 


wherein Q is selected from the group consisting of a nitro group, 
a substituted amino group and an unsubstituted amino group, Z is 

an organopolysiloxane group represented by the formula II 

in which R¹ is a divalent organic group having at least 2 carbon 
atoms, R² through R⁶ are the same or different monovalent organic 

groups, n is an integer having a value of at least 1 and m is 0 
or 1. The above organopolysiloxane may be reacted with an 

aromatic tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and, optionally, with  
 

an aromatic diamine to obtain a polyamide acid, which may then be 
subjected to a thermal imidization step to provide a polyimide 

having repeating units shown by the formulas VI and VII

aromatic group and A² is a divalent organic group which contains 

a siloxane residue and wherein the molar ratio of repeating unit

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
organopolysiloxane having bifunctional biphenyl groups and a
method for manufacturing the same. The invention further relates
to polyimides containing organopolysiloxane side chain, said
polimides being prepared from the novel organopolysiloxane. The
present application claims priority from Japanese Application
Numbers Hei 5(1993)-122827, Hci 5(1993)-933442 and Hei 4(1993)-122828.In recent years, macromolecules which have been under
intense research include polymers having polymerizable functional
groups (including oligomers), and by means of introducing
branches into copolymers, graft copolymers can be obtained
wherein the length and number of branches are controlled [for
reference, see Yuya Yamashita, Makuro-monoma no kagaku to kogyo
Macromonomer Chemistry and Engineering, I.P.C (1989); Yuji
Kawakami, Macromolecules, Vol. 37, p. 264 (1988), and Yoshiki
Nakazo, Macromolecules, Vol. 39, p. 452 (1990)].Most known macromonomers contain vinyl phenyl groups,
acryloyl groups or methacryloyl groups as terminal polymerizing
groups, and thus are mainly used for chain-extension
polymerization. On the one hand, substances containing terminal 
diol, dicarboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid ester, diamine, phenol
groups, etc., have been documented (refer to Tezuka et al.,
Polymer, Vol. 30, p. 553 (1989); Tezuka et al., Macromolecules,
Vol. 24, p. 122 (1991); Kawakami et al., Polym. Bull., Vol. 25,
p. 521 (1991); Ogawa et al., Japanese Kokai Patent Application
No. Hei 1-132634; Nagase et al., Makromol. Chem., Rapid. Commun.,
Vol. 11, p. 185 (1990); Nagase et al., Japanese Kokai Patent
Application No. Hei 1-185327 and K.M. Snow et al., CAP-2,025,289,
June 23, 1991.) However, organopolysiloxanes having bifunctional
biphenyl groups as polymerizing groups and manufacturing methods
thereof are not yet known.Aromatic group polymers such as aromatic polyesters,
aromatic polyamide (aramide), and aromatic polyimide are becoming
increasingly important high performance polymer materials because
of their high mechanical strength, heat resistance, solvent
resistance, etc. (for reference, see Kobunshi Kakkai [Polymer
Society], Koseino Houkouzokukei Kobunshi Zaiyo High Performance
Aromatic Group Polymer Materials, Maruzen (1990)). However, in
comparison to conventional flexible polymers, these rigid chain
polymers lack solubility in solvents, and the melting point is
high and they are difficult to process. AB a result, industrial
development and application of the materials was just begun in
