<ABSTRACT>
The articles (P) to be coated are passed into a tubular 
duct (2) into which a bed (M) of loose coating material 

is also fed. The duct, which is preferably inclined 
with its input end (2a) in a higher position than its 

output end (2b), is then subjected to an angular 
rotational movement back and forth about its principal 

axis (X2). This movement causes the articles (P) to 
roll sideways on the bed (M) of coating material as they 

descend along the duct (2), whilst the material is also 
thrown onto the articles (P) being coated, particularly 

as a result of the sudden changing of the sense of 
rotation of the duct (2). 
The preferred application is for the coating of food 
products such as confectionery products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to a device 
for coating articles with a loose coating material which is 
intended to adhere to the surfaces of the articles. The invention has been developed with particular attention 
to its possible use in the food sector, for example, for 
applying a coating of granular, edible material to a 
product constituted by a spherical wafer casing containing 
a creamy filling, possibly covered with chocolate or other 
alimentary creams. In this type of use, the loose 
material may be constituted by a granular material such as, 
for example, chopped hazelnuts or almonds, grated coconut, 
sugar crystals, etc. The solutions currently used in the art for the automatic 
application of such a coating are derived from two basic 
courses of action, that is: 
solutions in which the products to be coated are 
introduced into a container containing the loose coating 
material, and solutions in which the coating material is dropped or 
thrown towards the products to be coated, which advance on 
a conveyor line. Exemplary of the first kind of solutions are the arrangements disclosed, 
e.g., in GB-A-972 904, US-A-2 970 563 or US-A-3 381 658, this 
last-cited document being the one after which the preambles of Claims 
1 and 10 were patterned. In both cases, the coating usually takes place in several  
 
successive stages with intermediate rotation of the 
products to cause the coating to extend as homogeneously as 
possible over the entire surface of the products. The adhesion of the coating material is usually achieved by 
virtue of the fact that the product to be coated is covered 
by a layer of material (for example, a so-called coating of 
chocolate or another edible cream) which is kept in a 
softened state during the application of the granular 
coating. After the application of the coating, the 
material sets (usually as a result of cooling) and thus 
keeps the particles of the granular coating fixed to the 
surface of the product coated. In practice, various problems arise with the use of the 
solutions of the prior art. In the first place, it may quite easily be found that the 
particles of the coating are held on the coated product 
inadequately; although the particles of the loose coating 
material adhere to the coated product initially, they tend 
to separate therefrom upon the slightest stress, for 
example, when the product is removed from the coating 
station. This leads, on the one hand, to an adverse 
effect on the appearance of the finished product (the 
produ
