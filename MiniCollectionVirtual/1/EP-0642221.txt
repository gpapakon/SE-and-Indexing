<ABSTRACT>
In an output filter for an oversampling D-A 
converter of the present invention, an n-tap FIR filter 

of a predetermined characteristic is constituted from a 
predetermined number of DFFs and resistors connected to 

individual taps, and a one-bit output of a delta-sigma 
modulator 2 is inputted. The filter includes a number 

of DFFs 11₁ to 11
n-1
 equal to a number n of taps of the 
FIR filter in cascade connection and resistors R₀ to 

R
n-1
 connected between tap outputs (Q), (/Q) of the 
DFFs and a common output terminal (A) of the FIR filter 

and having resistance values which are in proportion to 
reciprocal numbers to absolute values of filter tap 

coefficients. For the tap outputs of the DFFs 11₁ to 
11
n-1
, the positive outputs (Q) or the inverting 
outputs (/Q) are selected in accordance with the 

positive or negative sign of the tap coefficients. In 
another form, those tap outputs (Q or /Q) of the DFFs 

which are not selected for connection to the positive 
output terminal of the FIR filter are connected in 

common to a inverting output terminal (/A) of the FIR 
terminal by way of resistors R₀' to R
n-1
' having 
resistance values equal to corresponding resistors R₀ 

to R
n-1
, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an output filter for an
oversampling digital-to-analog (hereinafter referred to
as D-A) converter, and more particularly to an output
filter for an oversampling D-A converter for converting
a delta-sigma modulation output obtained by single-bit
quantization by D-A conversion and filtering the same.
Description of the Related ArtAn oversampling D-A converter based on the delta-sigma
modulation technique allows reduction of the bit
number to 1 and, even where the converter has a low
resolution, allows achievement of a high signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N ratio) and reduction of distortion
caused by D-A conversion. Therefore, oversampling D-A
converters are employed in the digital audio field in
place of D-A converters of high accuracy which have
conventionally been required.FIG. 1 shows the basic construction of the
oversampling D-A converter described above. The
oversampling D-A converter shown is constituted from an
inner digital filter 1, a delta-sigma modulator 2, a 
one-bit D-A converter 3, and a post filter 4 which
serves as an output filter. An input signal such as a
digitalized audio signal is inputted to the delta-sigma
modulator 2 after the sampling frequency is raised to
from several tens to approximately 200 times the
sampling frequency of the input signal by the inner
digital filter 1. The digital signal sampled with the
raised frequency is quantized by one-bit quantization
by the delta-sigma modulator 2 and is then converted
into an analog signal by the next one-bit D-A converter
3, whereafter it is sent to the output filter 4 at the
next stage. The output filter 4 removes high frequency
noise components from the analog signal inputted
thereto and outputs a signal of good reconstructed
waveform.The output filter 4 is constituted from an active
filter including a plurality of stages, for example, as
shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 2, the one-bit
quantization output (complementary outputs) of the
delta-sigma modulator 2 are inputted directly to the
active filter 4. The present construction can be
considered, as far as the input to the active filter 4
is concerned, equivalent to a construction wherein an
output analog signal of the one-bit D-A converter 3 of
FIG. 1 is inputted to the active filter 4. In 
particular, since the one-bit quantization output of
the delta-sigma modulator 2 is either "1" or "0" and
the D-A converter 3 which converts the one-bit output
into an analog signal converts the outputs "1" and "0"
into signals of amplitudes of, for example, +3 volts
and
