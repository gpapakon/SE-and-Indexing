<ABSTRACT>
The tapping acupuncture apparatus is composed of the part of tapping-acupuncture (10), the buffer connector (20), the handle and electric-powered part (30), and the body of the supporting control part (40). The non-electromagnetic conduction needle (13A), the electromagnetic semi-conduction needle (13B), the magnetic conduction needle (12), and the electric conduction needle (14) are combined and arranged properly on the tapping acupuncture plate (15). So, the exchange, metastasis and reaction of force-energy can be affected on the human body, and therefore diseases which will generate or are already generated in the human body can be prevented or cured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acupuncture-tapping apparatus. In
particularly, it concerns an acupuncture-tapping apparatus comprising an
acupuncture-tapping part including an acupuncture-tapping plate attached various
needles, a buffer connector, a driving part, a handle and if necessary, an
additional support part, which obtains the effects for improving one's physical
condition and preventing the diseases.There has been no special tapping theory in the world before the present
inventor established that theory, and the old instruments for tapping has been
those made poorly from a bamboo or plastic, which is too simple to compete with
the acupuncture-tapping apparatus of the present invention. As well, the old
tapping instruments are quite different from the acupuncture-tapping apparatus of
the present invention in respect of the function and the structure.The present invention is based on the theories of physiotherapy which
have kept human health such as acupuncture & moxibustion, Buhang(suction
therapy after acupuncturing for suction of virulent blood and abnormal force-energy
into a jar), finger-pressure(manual) therapy, X-ray or light projecting
therapy, electromagnetic therapy.Although "the tapping method" and the acupuncture-tapping method
asserted by the present inventor may be recognized to be entirely unfamiliar since
it has never been theorized yet, a tapping method is well known. Massage is a 
kind of tapping methods. Generally, people tap or massage a pain region in
order to remove pain. The very action is a kind of the tapping methods.However, it is natural that when someone beats the other on the
whole body including his head for the purpose of medical treatment, he may
feel fear, discomfort, rejection symptom and the like. However, the present
inventor found that the acupuncture-tapping therapy changes the abnormal
state of a human body into normal one and moreover has an outstanding
effect on improving human habitude-physical constitution through the clinical
study subjected to myself, my family, and relatives.An electric simulation device is known from Soviet Inventions
Illustrated, Section S-X, Week 9151, 12 February 1992 relating to the
Patent document SU-A-1641346. This device uses an electrostatic charge
source formed from a friction pair made of materials with differing dielectric
permeabilities. Needles protruding from the surface of one of these materials
are given an electrostatic charge by relative frictional movement between the
materials and the device is moved over the

An acupuncture-tapping apparatus comprising an acupuncture-tapping

part (10) and a handle 32, characterised in that said apparatus includes an
acupuncture-tapping plate (15) having attached needles (11,12,13A,13B,

14), a buffer connector (20) attached to the acupuncture-tapping part (10)
solely by resilient means (22,23) for buffering the acupuncture-tapping part

(10), a driving part (30) attached to the buffer connector (20) for operating
the buffer connector (20), said handle (32) including a power switch (35)

and current controllers (36,37) for supplying and controlling power to the
driving part (30) and a support part (40) connected to the driving part (30)

for supporting the driving part (30).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the tapping part (10)
comprises at least four needles per 1cm
2
 of the tapping plate (15) having an
area no greater than 200cm
2
.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the needles of
the tapping part (10) have a diameter of 0.5 to 5 mm and a length of 1 to

10 mm.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the needles of
the tapping plate (15) are selected from the group consisting of non-electromagnetic
