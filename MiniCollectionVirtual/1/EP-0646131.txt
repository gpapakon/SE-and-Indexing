<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for potentiating the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage, the method including the steps of increasing the affinity of high-density lipoprotein for macrophages by the administration of a serum amyloid A/high-density lipoprotein complex, exposing the macrophage to the complex, and potentiating macrophage cholesterol efflux.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SERU AMYLOID A PROTEINTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to means for potentiating the collection of cholesterol from inflammatory or atherosclerotic sites, having the capability of being used to treat hypercholesterolemia and improving atherosclerotic conditions. More specifically, the present invention provides a therapeutic method which potentiates the ability to transfer macrophage cholesterol to a natural transport mechanism for subsequent excretion.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSerum levels of cholesterol and atherosclerosis are significant topics addressed by health care professionals as they relate to cardiac disease, as well as other circulatory and systemic diseases. There is a great interest in the medical field with regard to the reduction of serum cholesterol and the reversal of an atherosclerotic condition.Various means have been used in an attempt to lower serum cholesterol. For example, various resins have been administeredSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 therapeutically to sequester bile acids and thereby reduce systemic cholesterol levels. Other therapeutics have been administered in an attempt to effect cholesterol metabolism. However, there remains a high level of interest and need for more effective therapeutics in this area.Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an apolipoprotein which is present on high density lipoprotein (HDL) only during inflammatory states. SAA was discovered approximately 15 years ago in the course of studies examining serum for potential precursors to the inflammation-associated AA form of amyloid. It has been determined that the AA peptide responsible for the inflammation-associated amyloid fibril represented a fragment of the SAA protein (1,2) . Based on amino acid sequencing of SAA in the preparation, cloning, and identification of genes possessing the information for this protein (1,3), it became apparent that SAA was not a single protein, but rather a family of several related proteins. Work with these proteins have shown that during an inflammatory reaction, the cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosisSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 factor are responsible for regulating the transcription of the SAA gene in liver (4,5). Recent studies have suggested that SAA has a significant influence on lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase activity associated with the HDL (6).It is well established that SAA is present in the circulation in substantial quantities only during inflammation. Ninety percent (90%) or more of the SAA is associated with HDL's. HDL is also well established

 CLAIM8
What is Claimed is:
1. A method of potentiating the collection of cholesterol from inflammatory or atherosclerotic sites, comprising: increasing the affinity of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) for macrophage, exposing the macrophage to the HDL and potentiating release of cholesterol to a natural mechanism for cholesterol excretion.
2. A method of claim 1 wherein said step of increasing the affinity is further defined as binding serum amyloid A (SAA) to HDL; said exposing step being further defined as exposing the macrophage to an amount of SAA bound to HDL effective to increase macrophage cholesterol release to said natural mechanism.
3. A method of claim 2 wherein said potentiating step is further defined as increasing the amount and affinity of binding sites for HDL on macrophages.
4. A method of claim 3 further defined as decreasing the amount and affinity of binding sites for HDL on hepatocytes.
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


 5. A method of potentiating the collection of macrophage cholesterol comprising: administering an effective amount of HDL bound to a ligand which potentiates the affinity of HDL for macrophages; exposing macrophages to the HDL bound to the ligand; and potentiating macrophage cholesterol release to a natural mechanism for cholesterol excretion.

 AME DED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 6 September 1993 (06.09.93); original claims 1-5 replaced by amended claims 1-5 (2 pages)]
1. Use of a composition comprising an effective amount of a serum amyloid A/high density lipoprotein complex, for the manufacture of a medicament for a patient in need thereof, for potentiating the collection of cholesterol from inflammatory or atherosclerotic sites.
2. Use of a composition according to claim 1 which further comprises binding said serum amyloid A (SAA) to said high density lipoprotein (HDL) and exposing macrophage thereto so as to increase macrophage cholesterol release to a natural mechanism.
3. Use of a composition according to claims 1 and 2 for the production of a medicament to potentiate collection of cholesterol from an inflammatory or atherosclerotic site.
4. Use of a medicament according to claim 3 wherein said potentiating step is further defined as increasing the amount and affinity of binding sites for HDL on macrophages. 


5. Use of a medicament according to claim 3 further defined as decreasing the amount and affinity of binding sites for HDL on hepatocytes. 

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
Claims 1-5 originally filed are hereby cancelled in favour of new claims 1-5 submitted herewith on the attached replacement pages 32 and 33.
The search report criticizes the claims originally filed as concerning an "in-vivo" method for treating the human/animal body. New claims 1-5 have been drafted in Swiss form, i.e. the use of a composition for the production of a medicament for treating patients. It is believed that this format is in proper order and these claims distinguish over the references of record, none of which even hint at any therapeutic use of serum amyloid A.
