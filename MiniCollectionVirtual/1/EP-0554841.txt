<ABSTRACT>
An assembly (10) for introducing a catheter (18) into 
a blood vessel is provided. The assembly includes a needle 

hub (12) having a needle (14) secured thereto. The needle 
(14) includes an elongate shaft having a bevelled tip 

(15). A portion of the needle (14) shaft adjacent to the 
tip (15) has a relatively large outside diameter. The 

shaft diameter of this portion exceeds the diameter of the 
shaft portion adjoining the tip (15) and the diameter of 

the shaft portion extending between the enlarged shaft 
portion and the needle hub (12). A catheter (18) is 

mounted over the shaft of the needle (14) and includes an 
inner surface which bears against the enlarged shaft 

portion. A substantially leak-proof seal is thereby 
provided between the catheter (18) and the needle shaft. A 

needle tip cover (16) is slidably mounted to the needle 
(14) shaft and is engageable with the enlarged portion of 

the shaft to prevent its removal therefrom. The catheter 

(18) is releasably mounted to the needle tip cover (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to catheter introducer assemblies including 
means for protecting the user against needle sticks 
once the catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and the 
introducer needle is removed from the catheter. A common technique for introducing catheters into blood 
vessels includes the steps of providing a catheter positioned 
over an introducer needle, inserting the needle and 
catheter into a blood vessel, and then withdrawing the 
needle from the catheter, leaving the catheter in place in 
the blood vessel. The withdrawal of the needle from the 
catheter causes the exposure of the tip of the needle. As 
the tip is quite sharp and is typically contaminated with 
bodily fluid, the needle may present a health risk unless 
steps are taken to cover the tip. A health risk is also 
presented by leakage of bodily fluid between the outside of 
the needle and the inside of the catheter. More particularly the present invention relates to a catheter 
introducer device according to the preamble of 
claim 1. A device of this kind is disclosed in US-A- 5 049 136. The subject 
of the present invention is a device comprising the 
features of both preamble and characterizing portion of 
claim 1.  
 A catheter introducer device is provided which includes a 
needle having an elongate shaft secured to a needle hub, the 
shaft including a sharp tip, a first shaft portion adjoining 
the needle hub, a second shaft portion adjoining the tip, 
and a third shaft portion located between the first and 
second shaft portions, the  
 
third shaft portion having a larger outside diameter than 
the outside diameters of the first and second shaft 
portions. A catheter is mounted over the needle. The 
third shaft portion bears against the inner surface of 
the catheter, forming a substantially leak-proof seal 
therewith. A cover is slidably mounted to the needle 
shaft. The third shaft portion is engageable with an 
engaging member. The engaging member permits the needle 
to slide inside the cover until the third shaft member 
meets the engaging member thus preventing the cover from 
being removed from the needle shaft. The third shaft portion preferably has a 
substantially cylindrical configuration. A fourth shaft 
portion of substantially conical configuration preferably 
adjoins the third shaft portion at its larger end and the 
first shaft portion at its smaller end. The fourth shaft 
portion provides a smooth and uniform transition from the 
first shaft portion to the third portion, and forms the 
part of the

<CLAIMS>
A catheter introducer device (10) comprising: 

a needle (14); 
a catheter tube (18) mounted over the needle (14) and slidable on the needle 
(14); 
a needle hub (12); 
the needle (14) comprising an elongate shaft, a needle tip (15), a first shaft 
portion (14a) adjoining the needle hub (12), a second shaft portion (14b) adjoining the 

tip (15) and a third shaft portion (14c) between the first (14a) and second shaft 
portions (14b), wherein the configuration of the third shaft portion (14c) is such that 

the third shaft portion (14c) does not substantially hinder the passage of the needle 
(14) and the catheter tube (18) into and out of a vessel, and further wherein the 

catheter tube (18) is slidable on the shaft over the third shaft portion (14c); and 
a needle tip cover (16), slidable on the shaft between a first position in which 
the needle tip (15) is exposed and a second position in which the needle tip (15) is 

shielded by the needle tip cover (16), the needle tip cover (16) comprising engagement 
means for engaging the third shaft portion (14c) thus preventing the needle 

tip cover (16) from sliding off the shaft, said device being characterized in that the 
engagement means comprises a hole (70) in a needle tip cover end wall (64) 

through which hole (70) the needle (14) extends, the third shaft portion (14c) has an 
outside diameter larger than the outside diameters of the first (14a) and second (14b) 

shaft portions and larger than the diameter of the hole (70) in the needle tip cover end 
wall (64) and in that the needle tip cover (16) comprises needle tip obstructing means 

having a transverse wall (63) which abuts the shaft when the needle tip cover (16) is 
in the first position and obstructs the needle tip (15) when the needle tip cover (16) 

is in the second position so that the needle tip cover (16) cannot be moved back to the 
first position. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the shaft includes a 
fourth shaft portion (14d) having a substantially conical 

configuration, the fourth shaft portion (14d) including a 
first end having a relatively large outside diameter which 

adjoins and forms part of the third shaft portion (14c) and 
a second end having a relatively small outside diameter 

which adjoins the first shaft portion (14a), the fourth 
shaft portion (14d) providing a smooth and uniform transition 

from the first shaft portion (14a) to the third shaft 
portion (14c). 
The device of claim 2 wherein the needle (14) shaft 
includes a fifth shaft portion (14e) extending between the 

third shaft portion (14c) and the second shaft portion 
(14b), the fifth portion (14e) having a substantially 

conical configuration. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the third shaft portion 
(14c) is adapted to bear against the inside surface of the 

catheter (18) and form a seal therewith. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the third shaft portion 
(14c) is substantially closer to the tip (15) of said needle 

(14) than to said needle hub (12). 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said third shaft 
portion (14c) has an outside diameter about 0.102 mm (0.004 

inches) larger than the outside diameter of the first shaft 
portion (14a). 
The device of claim 1 wherein the needle obstructing 
means comprises resilient means (58) for automatically 

obstructing the needle tip (15) by said transverse wall (63) when the needle tip cover 
(16) is moved into the second position.
