<ABSTRACT>
Device for moulding a seal or a framing element onto the edge of a shaped window, comprising two moulding forms (9a and 9b) made of elastic material and means for exerting a hydraulic pressure on these moulding forms. This device comprises a series of thrust sectors (11a or 11b) disposed on the periphery of the moulding forms (9a and 9b) on which the hydraulic pressure is exerted and thus exerting this pressure on the moulding forms.

<CLAIMS>
1. Device for moulding a joint (1) or framing element 
on the edge of a contoured window pane (2) comprising 

two moulding forms (9a, 9b) made of an elastic material 
and means for exerting a hydraulic pressure on these 

moulding forms, wherein it includes a series of thrust 
sectors (11a, 11b) disposed at the periphery of the 

moulding forms (9a, 9b), hydraulic pressure being 
exerted on these sectors and thus transmitted to the 

moulding forms (9a, 9b). 
2. Device according to claim 1, 
wherein each pair of thurst sectors (11a, 11b) disposed 

opposite each other comprise a pair of crushing 
limiters (14a, 14b) in support on each other when the 

device is closed. 
3. Device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein it 
comprises one upper peripheral hydraulic chamber (13b) 

and one lower peripheral hydraulic chamber (13a) 
connected to a given hydraulic pressure and 

transmitting this pressure to the thrust sectors (11a, 
11b) in a sealed way by means of annular elastic 

membranes (12a, 12b). 
4. Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the retaining plates (6a, 6′a) and the guide 

plates (7a, 7′a) and (7b, 7′b) are rendered integral 
with a half-frame (5a-5b) of the mould and used to 

radially guide the moulding forms (9a, 9b) and the 
thrust sectors (11a, 11b).  

 
5. Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the moulding forms (9a, 9b) are mounted 

floating and have collars (16a, 16b) able to freely 
evolve between the shoulders of the retaining and guide 

plates. 
6. Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein one or several rods (17) provided with suction 

caps (18) are mounted sliding inside the lower half and 
allow for the stress-free laying and ejection of the 

window panes.
