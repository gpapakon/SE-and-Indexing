<ABSTRACT>
To reduce near-end crosstalk (NEXT) in systems possessing 
excess bandwidth, a signal is transmitted from a first (101) to a 

second location (102). At the second location, the received signal 
is examined and a characteristic of this signal is determined (in 

114) while the delay provided (by 116) in the transmit signal path 
at this location is varied. Based on this examination, a particular 

amount of delay is introduced into the transmit signal path which 
reduces NEXT. This process is repeated for each direction of 

transmission. In the disclosed embodiment, the characteristic of 
the received signal which is determined is the mean square error and 

the amount of delay selected is that corresponding to the minimum 
mean square error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transceiver apparatus and to methods for
use in a transceiver apparatus.Distortion, such as crosstalk, is a common impairment in communication
systems. Near-end crosstalk (NEXT) refers to the undesirable coupling of a signal
transmitted in one direction into the signal transmitted in the opposite direction. This
can arise in a variety of system applications. In one common scenario, a signal
transmitted from a transceiver onto a full-duplex link is coupled back into the receiver
of that transceiver. NEXT cancellers have been used to reduce NEXT in such
occurrences. Typically, the NEXT canceller is disposed at a particular location and
cancels the NEXT in the received signal at the location. This is accomplished by
processing the received signal at the particular location along with the signal transmitted
from this location. The shortcoming of NEXT cancellers is that their cost and
complexity exceed the objectives of certain system applications. Accordingly, it would
be desirable if a less costly and complex technique for reducing NEXT could be
developed.U.S.-A-4,571,465 discloses an echo canceller used in a data transmission
modem for canceling in the baseband signal of the receive path an echo signal produced
by the data signal from the transmit path. The echo canceller comprises a difference
circuit for forming the difference between the receive path and a synthetic echo copy
signal. The echo copy signal is formed by at least one transversal filter which operates
at a sampling frequency equal to the frequency of the data and whose coefficients are
adjusted to minimize the mean square value of an error signal.According to one aspect of this invention there is provided transceiver
apparatus as claimed in claim 1.According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a method
as claimed in claim 8.Broadly, the present invention addresses the problem of reducing NEXT
in systems possessing excess bandwidth. Pursuant to the present invention, a signal is 
transmitted from a first transceiver to a second. At the second transceiver, the received
signal is examined and a characteristic of this signal is determined while a plurality of
different delays are introduced into the signal transmitted by this transceiver. Based on
this examination, a particular amount of delay is introduced into the transmit signal path
of the second transceiver which reduces the NEXT in the signal received by this
transceiver. By repeating this process at the first transceiver, the NEXT in the
