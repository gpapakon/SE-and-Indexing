<ABSTRACT>
Methods for separating at least two types of parts (14-19) from a series of parts (14-19) in a separating installation having a separating apparatus (20). The parts (14-19) are fed to the separating apparatus (20) at a transporting speed (v2), and, for the satisfactory separation of a defined part (e.g. 14) from the series of parts (14-19) in front of the separating apparatus (20), a minimum spacing (dmin) of the defined part (14) with respect to the preceding and/or following part (15) is necessary, and, for optimising the spacing, the defined part (14), in front of the separating apparatus (20), is transported with a speed profile which is specific for the defined part (14).

Method for separating defective glass sheets from
non-defective ones out of a succession of glass sheets

(14 - 19) in a separating unit with a separating
device (20), wherein the glass sheets (14 - 19) are fed

to the separating device (20) at a conveyance speed (v
2
)
and wherein for the satisfactory separation of a

particular defective glass sheet from the succession of
glass sheets (14 - 19) a minimum distance (d
min
) of the
particular defective glass sheet from the preceding

and/or following glass sheet is required in front of the
separating device (20), 
characterised in that
 in order
to optimize the distance for a trouble-free separation

of the particular defective glass sheet (14) the latter
is conveyed in front of the separating unit (20) with a

speed profile (V1, V2, V3) specific to the particular
defective glass sheet (14), wherein the particular

defective glass sheet (14) is conveyed at a corrective
speed (v
3
) if the original distance (d) of the particular
defective glass sheet (14) from the preceding glass

sheet (15) is smaller than the minimum distance (d
min
)
with unchanged speed compared with the preceding glass

sheet (15), wherein the corrective speed (v
3
) is slower
than or equal to the conveyance speed (v
2
), multiplied by

the distance (d) set by a spiked roller (12) and divided
by the minimum distance (d
min
).
Method for separating according to claim 1,

characterised in that
the glass sheets (14 - 19) are fed to the
separating unit at an initial speed (v
1
), wherein
the distance (d) set by the spiked roller depends
on the initial speed (v
1
) and the conveyance
speed (v
2
).
Separating unit for glass sheets for carrying out
the method according to one of claims 1 or 2 with a

separating device (20), wherein there is feedable to the
separating device (20) via roller bays (1 - 11) a

succession of glass sheets (14 - 19) to be separated
from one another, 
characterised in that
 in front of the
separating device (20) are disposed at least two roller

bays (1, 2) activatable independently of one another or
at least two segments of a roller bay (e.g. 1)

activatable independently of one another.
Separating unit according to claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 there is assigned to the rollers of a segment or
of a roller bay at least one drive activatable

independently of other drives and that the drive is
controllable by software.
Separating unit according to claim 3 or 4,

characterised in that
 a programmable controller with at
least one modularly laid-out intelligent subunit is used

to control the separating unit, wherein the subunit is
used to control and monitor time-critical processes.
