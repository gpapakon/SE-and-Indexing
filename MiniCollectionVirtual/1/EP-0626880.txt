<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the removal of suspended very
fine particles from industrial gases.In particular, the present invention facilitates separation and collection of
particulate matter, such as dust, mist, fumes, smoke, etc.,
dispersed in a gas, in a state of turbulent flow, by taking
advantage of certain effects associated with turbulence in a novel and
particular way using purely mechanical means.It is well known to those skilled in the art of fluid mechanics and related
fields of endeavour, that fine particles dispersed in a fluid in a turbulent state
of flow tend to follow the turbulent eddies and velocity fluctuations of the
turbulent fluid. This is an experience shared by many non-experts who have
witnessed a blizzard or a dust storm, where snow flakes or dust particles swirl
around in atmospheric turbulence, carried by the wind. Thus, turbulence
keeps particles suspended in the fluid well mixed.The removal of very fine particles, typically in the size range of about
0.01 to 100 microns, from industrial gases is a difficult and expensive
operation to perform efficiently. Devices traditionally employed for this
purpose involve electrostatic precipitators, a variety of filters and wet
scrubbers. Scrubbers are used also for the removal of noxious gases from
industrial gases. Cyclone collectors have been traditionally used for the
removal of particulates larger than about 5 microns and a concerted effort has
been made recently to extend their scope down to about 1 micron particulate
size.At the present time, there does not exist an inexpensive industrial gas
cleaning device that would efficiently collect very fine particulates either
without or with simultaneous removal of noxious gases.The present invention makes use of the mixing effects of turbulence for
the separation and collection of dispersed fine particles in a novel and special
way without the necessity of sticky substances or electricity.The gas, containing dispersed and
suspended particles often is, in engineering applications, in a turbulent state
while passing through a duct or some processing plant. Such ducts or plants
are bounded by solid walls, made mostly of metal but occasionally also of 
other types of solid materials. As the turbulent stream passes through such
ducts or processing plants, the particles suspended and dispersed in the fluid
are being continuously mixed by the action of turbulence and, as a result,
continually new particles are carried by the turbulence to the close proximity of
the solid walls of

A method of removing particulates from gas stream containing the same
which comprises :


a) conveying said gas stream in highly turbulent flow through at least one flow
passage situated over at least one stagnant region of gas where there is no net gas

flow and which communicates with said gas stream,
b) enabling the turbulent eddies of said gas stream carrying suspended particulates
to penetrate and then decay in said stagnant region where said particulates arc

trapped and deposited preferably by purely mechanical means on solid surfaces,
c) dislodging the deposits of said particulates, mainly by the action of gravity
d) removing said deposits.
The method of claim 1 wherein the turbulence in said gas stream is
enhanced by placing a grid or several grids ahead of or in the flow passages.
The method of claims 1 to 2, wherein upstream from said housing an
atomizer discharges into the gas stream a fine spray of a suitable liquid or slurry that

scrubs suspended particulates and noxious gases from the gas stream and is
subsequently precipitated on said solid surfaces and is discharged from the bottom of

said housing.
The method of claims 1 to 3, wherein said particles have diameter of from
about 0,01 to 100 microns, wherein said gas stream has a velocity of from about 10

to about 50 m/s, and wherein said flow passage are about 1 to about 8 cm high and
about 5 to about 30 cm wide.
Method of claims 1 to 4 wherein it further comprises the final step of
discharging said deposits into hoppers or other appropriate means.
Apparatus for removing particulates from gas and liquid streams
containing the same wherein it comprises at least a housing (10) having :


at least one passage (16) for conveying the said fluid stream in highly turbulent
flow,
vertical collector plates (18) orientated perpendicular to the direction of flow of
the gas stream which communicate with the at least one passage in order to create

thereunder at least one stagnant region where said particulates are trapped.
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein said stagnant regions are obtained by
placing parallel vertical plates (18) of from about 0.1 to about 3 mm thickness of

from about 3 to 10 cm height and about 0,5 to about 5 cm apart from each other,
underneath the flow passage, so that the bottom of said passage (16) is formed by the

upper edges of said vertical plates and the gaps present between said edges and the
particulates carried by said eddies between said
 plates deposit on the plates surface
by inertial impaction and by Brownian diffusion.
The apparatus of claims 6 or 7, wherein said stagnant regions between
said vertical plates (18) are packed with a suitable filter medium consisting of fibers

of a diameter from about 0.01 to about 1 micron, said filter medium having a solid
fraction of from about 0.001 to about 0.1 on the surface of which submicron

particulates deposit by Brownian diffusion.
The apparatus of claims 6 to 8, wherein both said vertical plates and said
passage have uniform height along the entire length of said at least one flow passage.
The apparatus of claims 6 to 9, wherein the heights of said vertical
plates is increased gradually from the upstream end of said passage over a distance of

from about 5 to about 30 cm from about to 3 cm to a maximum value of about 10 cm
which is maintained constant throughout the rest of the lenght of said passage

resulting in an initial gradual decrease of the height of said passage from about 8 cm
to a minimum value of about 1 cm which remains constant for the rest of their

length.
The apparatus of claims 6 to 10, wherein the top ends of said vertical
plates are bent or curved in the direction opposite to said gas flow.
The apparatus of claims 6 to 11, wherein said housing and said passage

are arranged one above the other with a suitable distance kept between them and said 

deposits, discharged from said housings, are removed by screw conveyors or by
pipes located between said housings.
The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the deposits discharged from said
housings oriented at an angle with respect to the horizontal slide or flow downwards

on the outside top surface of said housings positioned underneath.
The apparatus of claims 6 to 15, wherein said particles have diameter of
