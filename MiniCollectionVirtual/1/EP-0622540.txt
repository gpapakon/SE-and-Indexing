<ABSTRACT>
Heating device for an internal combustion engine with external mixture formation and fuel injection and at least one intake port (2) and one injection nozzle (19), an electrically heatable heating element (3), around which the flow can pass on all sides, being arranged in the intake port (2), which heating element can be connected by connecting terminals (4) to an electrical current source (5). The heating element (3) is formed by a composite part (6) of laminated construction which has a pan-shaped cross-section transversely to the direction of flow (7).

A heating module (1) for an internal combustion 
engine with external mixture formation and fuel injection 

and with at least one intake duct (2) and one injection 
nozzle (19), there being arranged in the intake duct (2) an 

electrically heatable heating element (3) around which flow 
is possible on all sides and which can be connected by means 

of connection terminals (4) to an electric current source 
(5), and the heating element (3) being formed by a composite 

part (6) which is built up in layers and has a cross-section 
which is channel-shaped transversely to the direction of 

flow (7), characterized in that the heating element (3) has 
a surface (8) of metallic material, in that a flexible 

conductor track (9) made of electrically conductive material 

is arranged between a channel-shaped surface layer (8.1) and 
an underlying layer (8.2), and in that the conductor track 

(9) and the metallic material are adhesively bonded. 
A heating module according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the metallic material is formed by two aluminium 

sheets (10, 11) which have a thickness of 0.2 to 1 mm. 
A heating module according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the aluminium sheets (10, 11) are provided with 

integrally formed retaining webs (12) which are fixed to the 
wall bounding the intake duct (2). 
A heating module according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the metallic material consists of two copper sheets 

which have a thickness of 0.2 to 1 mm. 
A heating module according to any one of claims 1 to 
4,characterized in that the heating element (3) is provided 

with an arcuate profile on the side facing the injected 
fuel. 
A heating module according to any one of claims 1 to  
 

5, characterized in that the heating element (3) has a 
radius of curvature (13) which changes in a stepless manner 

in the direction of flow (7) and/or has a channel depth (14) 
which changes in a stepless manner in the direction of flow 

(7). 
A heating module according to any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the heating element (3) extends at 

an angle (α) to the longitudinal axis of the injected fuel 
jet (15) and encloses with the latter an angle (α) of 1 to 

90°, and in that the heating element (3) extends essentially 
parallel to the streamlines of the intake duct (2). 
A heating module according to any one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the heating element (3) is 

connected to an engine control system (16) in a manner which 
allows the transmission of signals. 
A heating module according to any one of claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the heating element (3) is designed 

in such a way as to taper to a point on the side facing the 
internal combustion engine. 
A heating module according to any one of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the heating element (3) is 

connected to a flange (20) which forms part of the intake 
duct (2), and in that the flange (20) is provided with a 

conduit (23) through which a heating medium can flow and 
which is connected to the heating element (3) in a thermally 

conductive manner by the retaining webs (12).
