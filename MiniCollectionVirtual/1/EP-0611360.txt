<CLAIMS>
A handling hopper, in particular for materials 
which have a tendency to agglomerate and adhere to the 

walls, comprising a vibrating base above which is mounted a 
body in the shape of an open box extending vertically 

between an upper inlet section and a lower outlet section, 
the lower outlet section extending over an area at least 

equal to that of said upper inlet section, an opening (10) 
extending over the entire width of the body (8, 9) of the 

hopper, characterised in that said base (12-15, 13, 13a) is 
formed by a plate (12, 15) suspended from the hopper body, 

said base (12-15, 13, 13a) being subjected to substantially 
horizontal unidirectional vibration (f1, f2) in a direction 

perpendicular to that of said opening (10). 
A hopper according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the plate (12, 15) of said base is inclined with a 

slope directed towards said opening (10). 
A hopper according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the plate (12) of said base has a curved surface, 

the curvature of which decreases gradually from the upstream 
portion towards the downstream portion discharging into said 

opening (10). 
A hopper according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the plate (15) of said base has plane surface 

inclined towards said opening (10). 
A hopper according to claims 3 or 4, characterised 
in that the plate (12, 15) of said base comprises on its 

upper surface patterns (17) projecting and in stages, which 
are intended to assist the advance of material circulating 

from upstream to downstream. 
A hopper according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the opening is situated at the base of 

a wall (9) of said body (8, 9).
