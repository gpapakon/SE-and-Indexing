<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning device for optically 
scanning symbol codes, such as bar codes, comprising a laser 
source for producing a scanning beam, a first lens for focusing the 
scanning beam, a detector for detecting light backscattered by the 
scanned symbol codes, first and second rotatable deflection means 
for both transmitting and deflecting the scanning beam so as to 
generate a scanning pattern, and drive means for rotating the first 
and second deflection means around a first and second axis of rotation, 
respectively. In many scanning devices, e.g. in bar code readers, multiple 
directional scanning is used. Because of a large longitudinal working 
range, laser scanners are widely used for bar code reading. To 
read bar codes, at least one scanning line needs to be generated to 
scan the bar code. However, in practice bar codes on products are 
situated at an arbitrary orientation. To still be able to read bar 
codes by using a bar code reader oriented itself in an arbitrary 
direction, bar code readers generating multiple-directional scanning 
patterns are required. Moreover, different kinds of objects often require a different 
kind of scanning pattern. In the publication "Thermal imaging systems" by J.M. Lloyd, 
Plenum Press, New York, 1979, pages 316-320, the general principles 
of the use of rotating wedges for generating scanning patterns is 
disclosed. However, this document only discloses passive scanning 
means, i.e. no additional scanning beam is generated, e.g. by a 
laser source, to scan an object. In this passive scanning means 
known per se, a light beam reflected by an object impinges upon a 
first one of the two rotating wedges. Before incidence, the light 
beam propagates along a path that makes an angle with respect to 
the axis of rotation of both wedges. After deflection by both 
wedges, the light beam propagates substantially parallel to the 
axis of rotation of the wedges to detection means. EP-A-0.492.730, from which claim 1 is delimited, describes 
how the general principles of using two rotating wedges may be 
employed in active scanning devices such as bar code scanners, and 
what technical measures may realize a bar code scanner embodying  
 
these principles. Both in theoretical considerations as formulated, for 
instance, in the publication of Lloyd mentioned above and in the 
practical design shown in said EP-A-0.492.730 two rotating wedges 
are used, the axes of rotation of both of the wedges coincide, as 
this was considered to be necessary to
