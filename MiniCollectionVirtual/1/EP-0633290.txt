<ABSTRACT>
1. A polymer mixture of   A) at least one fluoropolymer in an amount of from 50 to 99% by weight and B) at least one polyarylene sulphone or polyarylene compound containing at least two of the bridges -S-, -SO- and -SO2- or a mixture of the two in an amount of from 1 to 50% by weight,  where the sum of components A) and B) is always 100% by weight. This mixture is used for the production of sliding bearings or seal materials having reduced creep tendency and reduced abrasion.
