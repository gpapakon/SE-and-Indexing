<ABSTRACT>
Process for decorating ceramic tiles including the 
following steps: a) the pressing of powders so as to form a 

pressed item (1); b) the forming, during the pressing of 
the item, of recesses (2,3) that affect the face that is 

meant to remain in view, these recesses being peripherally 
surrounded by a rim (4,5) the extension whereof matches 

the contour of the decoration to be obtained; c) the 
application, in these recesses, of preset doses (6,7) of 

mixtures and/or enamels of decorative material that have a 
fluid consistency that allows these mixtures to spread so 

as to cover the bottom of the recesses; and finally d) the 
baking of the item.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
decorating ceramic tiles and to tiles thus obtained. Silk-screen printing techniques are currently used to 
decorate tiles with ornamental patterns; by means of these 
techniques, the colors are applied in the desired patterns 
on the surface of the pressed but as yet not baked tile or 
optionally on the pre-baked tile (the so-called "biscuit"). A principal technical aim of the present invention is 
to provide a process for decorating ceramic tiles that 
allows to manufacture products with new aesthetic 
characteristics that exceed those obtainable with 
conventional methods as regards both color and structural 
aspects. A particular object of the present invention is to 
provide a process that allows to affect the surface 
characteristics of tiles as regards the requirements of 
resistance to wear and to external factors. With this aim and this object in view there is 
provided, according to the present invention, a process for 
decorating ceramic tiles characterized in that it comprises 
the following steps: 
a) the pressing of powders so as to form a pressed 
item; b) the forming, during the pressing of the item, of at 
least one recess that affect the face that is meant to 
remain in view, said recess being peripherally surrounded 
by a rim the extension whereof matches the contour of the  
 
decoration to be obtained; c) the application, in said recess, of preset doses of 
mixes and/or enamels of decorative material having a fluid 
consistency that allows said mixture to spread so as to 
cover the bottom of said recess; and finally d) the final baking of the item. An additional aim of the present invention is to 
provide a tile produced with the above described process. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of a preferred but not exclusive embodiment 
thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawing, 
wherein: 
figure 1 is a plan view of a tile obtained with the 
process according to the present invention; figure 2 is a sectional view of the tile of figure 1, 
taken along the transverse plane II-II; figure 3 is a sectional view of a different embodiment 
of the tile. With reference to the above figures, the reference 
numeral 1 designates the substrate of a quadrangular tile, 
which is obtained by pressing powdery material in a normal 
mechanical or hydraulic press. Said substrate is 
hereinafter termed "pressed item" for convenience in 
description. Recesses

Process for decorating ceramic tiles, characterized 
in that it comprises the following steps: 


a) the pressing of powders so as to form a pressed 
item (1); 
b) the forming, during the pressing of the item, of at 
least one recess (2, 3) that affects the face that is meant 

to remain in view, said recess being peripherally 
surrounded by a rim (4, 5) the extension whereof matches 

the contour of the decoration to be obtained; 
c) the application, in said recess (2, 3), of preset 
doses of mixes and/or enamels of decorative material that 

have a fluid consistency that allows said mixtures to 
spread so as to cover the bottom of said recess; and 

finally 
d) the final baking of the item. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said pressed item (1) is pre-baked (biscuit baking) prior 

to the application of the decorative mixture. 
Process according to one or more of the previous 
claims, characterized in that the tile is polished after 

baking. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, comprising two recesses, the rims (4, 5) of said 

recesses being arranged at different levels. 
Process according to claim 1, comprising at least 
two recesses, the rims of said recesses having different 

thickness. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
 

claims, characterized in that said doses of mixtures and/or 
enamels of decorative material are applied by means of 

volumetric dosage devices. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said mixtures and/or enamels 

of decorative material have a pasty consistency which is in 
any case such as to ensure filling of the recesses. 
Ceramic tile comprising, on its exposed surface, at 
least one recess (2, 3) which is suitable to receive 

respective doses of mixtures and/or enamels of decorative 
material, said mixes and/or enamels being suitable to cover 

at least the bottom of said recess. 
Tile according to claim 8, comprising at least two 
recesses which are arranged at different levels. 
Tile according to claim 9, characterized in that 
said recesses are surrounded by rims (4, 5) having 

different thickness.
