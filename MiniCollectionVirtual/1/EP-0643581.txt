<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of an androgen or androgen
analogue for the preparation of a therapeutic composition for topically
treating symptoms of Keratoconjuctivitis sicca (KCS) in an eye of a
patient.The preocular tear film plays an essential role in the
maintenance of corneal integrity, the protection against
microbial challenge and the preservation of visual
acuity (1). These functions, in turn, are critically
dependent upon the stability, tonicity and/or composition of
the tear film structure, which includes an underlying mucin
foundation, a substantial, middle aqueous component and an
overlying lipid layer (1,2). Alteration, deficiency or
absence of the tear film may lead to intractable desiccation
of the corneal epithelium, ulceration and perforation of the
cornea, an increased incidence of infectious disease, and
ultimately, severe visual impairment and blindness (2,3).Throughout the world, countless individuals suffer from
tear film dysfunctions, which are collectively diagnosed as
keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or, simply, dry eye (1,2).
These lacrimal abnormalities may be subdivided into four
general categories: (a) aqueous tear deficiencies, which are
most frequently responsible for dry eye states, originate
from lacrimal gland disorders and include autoimmune disease,
congenital alacrima, paralytic hyposecretion or excretory
duct obstruction; (b) mucin deficiency, which is observed in
various conjunctival cicatrization conditions, such as
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, trachoma, pemphigoid, thermal and
chemical burns, as well as hypovitaminosis A; (c) lipidabnormalities, which may occur during eyelid inflammation
(e.g. chronic blepharitis); and (d) diminished eyelid
function (1).By far, the greatest single cause of KCS worldwide,
excluding those countries wherein trachoma remains epidemic,
is Sjögren's syndrome (2). This syndrome, which is the
second most common autoimmune disease (7,14), occurs almost
exclusively in females and is characterized by an insidious
and progressive lymphocytic infiltration into the main and
accessory lacrimal glands, an immune-mediated, extensive
destruction of lacrimal acinar and ductal tissues and the
consequent development of persistent KCS (7-10). In primary
Sjögren's syndrome, which afflicts about 50% of the patient
population, the disease is also associated with an
immunological disruption of the salivary gland and pronounced
xerostomia. In secondary Sjögren's, the disorder is
accompanied by another disease, which is most often
rheumatoid arthritis and
