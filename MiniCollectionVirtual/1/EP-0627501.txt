<ABSTRACT>
An improved chlor-alkali eletrolysis process carried out in 
cells comprising at least one couple of expandable anodes provided 

with mobile surfaces provided with an electrocatalytic coating, 
said couple being separated by a porous diaphragm, of the type made 

only of asbestos fibers, consisting in conducting an initial 
conditioning electrolysis step for a period longer than one hour, 

preferably between 5 and 10 days, with the anodes maintained in the 
restrained position by suitable retainers. After said conditioning 

step, the retainers are removed and the anodes set free to expand so 
that the respective mobile surfaces get in contact with the surfaces 

of the diaphragms. Electrolysis is carried out for prolonged times 
with low cell voltages and without noticeable damaging of the 

diaphragms.

<DESCRIPTION>
Among electrolytic processes, chlor-alkali electrolysis has 
certainly the highest industrial interest. Briefly, by this method 
the starting reactant, consisting of an aqueous solution of sodium 
chloride (hereinafter called brine), is separated into gaseous 
chlorine, an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen 
gas by applying electric current, which in a way acts as a further 
reactant. Chlor-alkali electrolysis is carried out today by means 
of three alternative technologies, i.e. mercury cathode, porous 
diaphragm and ion-exchange membrane. This last one is the most 
modern technology and is characterized by low energy consumptions 
and lack of both environmental and health drawbacks. Of the first two, the mercury cathode technology is probably bound 
to a rapid decline in consideration of the strict regulations 
existing in all the industrial countries in regard to the release of 
mercury in the environment. The improved cell design allows for 
meeting the severe tolerance limits imposed by the law but the public 
opinion nowadays clings to an "a priori" rejection of any process 
which may lead to a possible release of heavy metals in the 
environment. At present, the diaphragm technology relies on two alternative 
processes based on the use of diaphragms made only of asbestos 
fibers or comprising also an organic binder, respectively. The 
diaphragms made of asbestos fibers only are negatively affected by a  
 
poor mechanical stability. As far as known today, asbestos fibers 
may be removed by the erosion caused by the chlorine bubbles with 
the consequent deterioration of the diaphragm and the sharp and 
risky increase of the hydrogen content in chlorine. Therefore, in the 
prior art efforts have always been pursued to ensure a sufficient 
distance between the diaphragm and the anode surface in an attempt 
to minimize the erosion effect. Consequently, cells provided with 
diaphragms made only of asbestos fibers cannot exploit to the best 
the advantages offered by the expandable anodes available on the 
market. As is well known, said anodes have the shape of a flat box 
wherein the major surfaces, independent from each other, are mobile 
being provided with expanding means, that is elastic supports capable 
of exerting a spring action. During assembly, when the anodes are 
inserted in the limited space between each couple of adjacent 
cathodes, they are maintained in the restrained position by means of 
suitable retainers. Once the anodes are positioned, the retainers 
are removed and
