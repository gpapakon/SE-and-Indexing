<ABSTRACT>
Video data is compressed according to a bit rate to 
be subdivided into data blocks each having a predetermined 

number of bits. The blocks are sent to a shuffling circuit to 
undergo a shuffling predetermined for the circuit. To 

concentrate errors onto a portion of the shuffled video data, 
the data is delivered to an inverse shuffling circuit (26) to be 

subjected to an inverse shuffling so as to restore the data 
undergone a shuffling predetermined for a recording or 

transmitting apparatus, thereby transmitting the resultant 
compressed data to a D-2 VTR (14). This possibly reduces the 

interpolation probability on the screen and disperses the 

data. Even at occurrence of a burst error exceeding a 
correction capacity, propagation of the error can be minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video data 
compressor for compressing video data, and in particular, to 
a video data compressor connectible to a recording apparatus 
such as a digital video tape recorder or an optical disk for 
recording thereon digital video data or a transmitting 
apparatus. Heretofore, there has been known a video data 
compressing apparatus to be connected to a digital video tape 
recorder (VTR) or a digital image recording optical disk for 
compressing video data. In such an apparatus, a two-dimensional 
(2D) discrete cosine transform (DCT) is conducted 
to achieve data compression for video blocks each including 8 
pixels × 8 lines. The transform has been described, for 
example, in the Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 63-308474. 
Data undergone the transform is then subjected to 
processing steps such as a zigzag scan, a quantization, and a 
variable-length coding. These operations are controlled so 
that a predetermined number of bits are contained in each 
field or frame. The data compressing method has been 
described, for example, in an article entitled "Outline and 
Trend of Standardization of MPEG" (Monthly Interface. Aug. 
1992) and the Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 61-123280. In a video data compressor, the video data is thus 
compressed to be thereafter treated in the unit of 8-bit data  
 
for serial-to-parallel conversion. The data obtained as a 
result is transmitted to an apparatus such as a video tape 
recorder, an optical disk, or a data transmitting facility. 
In the apparatus, the compressed video data is shuffled to 
additionally produce error correction codes as described, for 
example, in the Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 62-199179. 
The resultant data is then combined with data such 
as audio data or system data. Thereafter, the data is 
subjected to a coding for recording thereof, an operation to 
produce a signal block therefrom, a channel separation for 
transmission thereof, an amplification by a recording 
amplifier, and the like. Finally, the data is recorded on a 
medium or transmitted to an external device. In this regard, in a stage of reproducing recorded 
data or in a transmission stage of data, there may possibly 
occur a burst error exceeding an error correcting capacity of 
the system. In the prior art, the burst error is dispersed in 
a broad range by a shuffling circuit predetermined for the 
recorder or transmitter. This provision is arranged to 
possibly enhance capacity of the error interpolation
