<ABSTRACT>
A number of embodiments of single intake valve per cylinder 
engine (31) wherein the induction passage (45) is provided 

with a control valve (67) for generating a tumble action in 
the intake passage (45) when the engine is operating at 

speeds other than high speed high load. The arrangements are 
designed so as to promote a stratification in the combustion 

chamber under some running conditions and the intake passage 
(45) is disposed at an angle to a plane containing the 

cylinder bore axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tumble valve arrangement for
an engine, and more particularly to an improved tumble valve
arrangement for an engine of the type having only a single
intake valve for each of its combustion chambers.The design of the induction system, like many other
features in an internal combustion engine, represents a
compromise of the optimum design for a given engine running
and load condition. That is, where an engine is designed to
operate over a wide variety of engine running conditions,
certain components, such as the induction system, are
designed to compromise the performance under certain
conditions to try to improve the performance as much as
possible throughout the entire engine speed and load ranges.For example, an induction system that is efficient at
low and mid-range speeds will provide too much restriction to
the air flow under high-speed performance, and high-speed
performance will deteriorate. That is, under low speed and
low loads it is desirable to have the charge enter the
combustion chamber at a relatively high velocity and also so
as to generate turbulence in the combustion chamber. Under
low speed, low load conditions, the turbulence is desirable
as it improves flame propagation and will ensure complete
combustion. On the other hand, a turbulence-inducing
induction system will restrict the flow at high speeds and
high loads, and hence can deteriorate high-speed performance.Conventional induction systems, therefore, represent a
compromise between optimum low speed and optimum high speed
performance. The actual type of performance which is
preferred will depend upon the application for the engine.There has been proposed, however, induction systems that
employ various devices wherein the induction system can have
a wider range of performance improvement. For example, the 
use of control valves in the induction passage to alter its
shape and/or effective cross-sectional area may be employed
so as to permit performance increases across the entire
engine speed and load ranges. GB-A-2 242 226 shows an adjustable baffle
that deflects the flow of gas to the valve of a combustion chamber.One type of turbulence-generating system and control
valve which has been employed includes a control valve which
directs the flow of the intake charge through the intake port
in different directions depending upon the engine running
condition. Under high-speed conditions, the control valve
provides substantially no restriction to the intake charge,
and the intake charge is delivered
