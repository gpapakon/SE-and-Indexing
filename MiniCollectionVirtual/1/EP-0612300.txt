<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bag-in-bottle packages 
which include a resilient squeeze bottle and and inner receptacles 
incorporating a flexible bag for housing a viscous product, and more 
particularly, to such inner receptacles which include a flexible 
product bag which inverts upon emptying. A wide variety of packages are known which include an outer 
squeeze bottle and an inner flexible product bag. Generally, the 
outer squeeze bottle includes a resilient side wall portion which 
when compressed, forces product from the bag through a dispensing 
passage. The dispensing passage generally includes a valve which 
prevents air from entering the product bag when the outer squeeze 
bottle is released. The squeeze bottle also generally includes a 
second valve which enables air to re-enter the outer squeeze bottle 
into the space located between the inner flexible product bag and 
outer squeeze bottle. Consequently, the inner product bag collapses 
as product is dispensed. One problem with such packages is that the 
inner flexible bag has a tendency to collapse pre-maturely; trapping 
product within the inner flexible bag so it cannot be dispensed. One method to ensure that product is not trapped inside the 
inner flexible bag is to provide a mechanism for causing the bag to 
invert about its midpoint. United States Patent 2,608,320, issued to 
Harrison on August 26, 1952, discloses such a package which provides 
for bag inversion. This package requires that a thinner, flexible,  
 
lower bag portion be sealed to an upper, thicker, rigid, bag portion 
around the entire curved circumferential surface of the bag in an air 
tight manner. However, complete sealing along such a curved surface 
is difficult to accomplish; particularly when utilizing heat sealing. 
In addition, the rigid top portion is not resilient such that it is 
squeezable. Thus, the user is only able to squeeze the bottom 
portion of the package. Commonly assigned United States Patent 4,842,165 which 
issued on June 27, 1989 to Van Coney discloses a package which 
includes an inner receptacle having a flexible product bag according to the preamble of claim 1. The bag 
of the inner receptacle is secured to the interior surface of the 
side wall of the outer squeeze bottle about its midpoint to provide 
bag inversion. In the illustrated embodiments of the Van Coney 
invention the inner receptacle is secured by attachment of its 
outermost surface to the innermost surface of the squeeze bottle; 
preferably by means of adhesive or by heat
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A squeeze bottle package (30) including an outer squeeze 
bottle (25) and an inner receptacle (20), the inner 

receptacle (20) including a flexible bag (22) having a 
dispensing passage (28), the flexible bag (22) being adapted 

to house a viscous product,
 
the outer squeeze bottle (25) having a resiliently deformable 

side wall, an opening at the top end of the squeeze bottle 
adapted to accommodate the dispensing passage of the inner 

receptacle (20) such that the dispensing passage (28) of the 
inner receptacle (20) provides communication with the opening 

at the top end of the outer squeeze bottle (25) to permit the 
product to be dispensed therethrough, and
 
a vent valve located in the outer squeeze bottle and adapted 

when the inner receptacle (20) is sealed therein, to 
substantially prevent air located between the inner 

receptacle (20) and the squeeze bottle (25) from exiting the 
package (30) when a squeezing force is applied to the 

resilient side wall so that product is dispensed from the 
package (30) through the discharge passage, and the vent 

valve being adapted to permit air to enter the space between 
the inner receptacle (20) and the squeeze bottle (25) upon 

release of the squeezing force
 
characterised in that the outer squeeze bottle (25) is 

reusable, and the inner receptacle (20) is replaceable 
through an opening at the bottom end of the squeeze bottle 

adapted to permit insertion of the entire inner receptacle 
therethrough, the opening having sealing closure means (80; 

280) for repeatedly sealing the replaceable inner receptacle 
(20) within the reusable outer squeeze bottle (25),
 
and wherein the inner receptacle (20) includes support means 

(26) for maintaining the top half of the flexible bag (22) in 
substantially its original, filled shape without attachment  

 
of the receptacle (20) to the squeeze bottle (25) near the 

midpoint of the bag (22), such that the flexible bag (22) can 
invert upon itself for dispensing substantially all of the product 

therefrom. 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to claim 1, 
wherein the sealing closure means for repeatedly sealing the 

replaceable inner receptacle (20) within the reusable outer 
squeeze bottle (25) is a single sealing closure means for 

simultaneously and repeatedly sealing the top end of the 
inner receptacle (20) to the outer squeeze bottle (25), 

wherein the single closure means comprises a screw on end 
plate (80) which is attached to an inner sleeve (84) which 

extends to the top end of the package (30) to push the top 
end of the inner receptacle (20) against an interior surface 

of the squeeze bottle (25) when screwed onto the bottom end 
of the package (30). 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to claim 1, 

wherein the sealing closure means comprises 
a top sealing closure means (274) for repeatedly sealing the 

top end of the inner receptacle (20) to the top end of the 
outer squeeze bottle (25), 

and 
a bottom sealing closure means (280) for repeatedly sealing 

the bottom end of the squeeze bottle (225) against the inner 
surface of the squeeze bottle.  

 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to Claim 2, wherein 
the inner sleeve (84) has an outer cross-sectional dimension substantially 

equal to the inner cross-sectional dimension of the outer squeeze 
bottle (25). 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to Claim 2 or 4, 
wherein the vent valve is located on the inner sleeve (84).  

 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to Claim 3, wherein 
the top closure means (274) includes a collar (276) which repeatedly attaches to 

the flexible bag (22) near the dispensing passage (28), and wherein the bottom 
closure means (280) includes an end plate which screws onto the bottom end 

of the squeeze bottle (225). 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to Claim 3 or 6, 
wherein the vent valve is located in the end plate. 
A squeeze bottle package (30) according to any one of the 
above Claims, further characterized by a suckback valve (52) located in 

the discharge passage of the flexible bag (22).
