<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism and method for the continuous winding of a web of paper (w) into rolls including a shear type load cell (32, 32a) for measuring the horizontal component of the reactive force on the winding drum with the output of the load cell being used to control the nip pressure (N) between the winding drum (15, 15a) and the roll being wound. Another load cell (39) measures the tension of the incoming paper web, and this measurement is subtracted to give the net nip pressure. An initial reading is taken when the core on which the web is to be wound is lowered onto the load cell (41) and an initial reading is taken to provide the index point of the weight of the core (18, 18a) and reel, and when the core is being pivoted downwardly over the drum (15, 15a), the vertical and horizontal components with the total nip load (N) are calculated to control the nip load. Thus, the nip load is carefully controlled at all positions to provide an improved drum winder obtaining controlled nip load and controlled density of the roll being wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in drum winding 
machines and, more particularly, to a paper machine drum winder, or reel, 
which continually winds successive rolls from an on-coming supply of 
paper web, such as from a papermaking machine. Still more particularly, 
this invention relates to apparatus for measuring and controlling the nip 
load of a wound paper roll against the reel support drum. A device of the general type for which the improvement is made is 
illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 3,743,199 and includes a mechanism for 
bringing a new spool, sometimes called a core in the papermaking trade, 
into engagement with a horizontal driven winding drum on the reel in a 
papermaking machine, and moving the new spool downwardly from an 
initial position over the drum to a wound roll winding position where the 
spool is supported on rails while the paper roll wound on the spool is  
 
nipped against the support drum. A web is fed onto the spool until the 
wound roll is completed, whereupon a new spool is started and the process 
is repeated. An important factor in the successive commercial winding of paper 
is to provide for a uniform roll structure. To do this, it is necessary to 
measure and control the nip level between the winding drum on the reel 
and the wound paper roll. This allows for a more uniform roll structure. Present day designs for a reel usually do not have a means for 
directly measuring the nip level between the winding drum and the wound 
paper roll. Some reels have been designed with a load cell arrangement in 
the secondary arms. These secondary arms of a reel usually rotate through 
an arc, and load cells, which are commercially available and which are used 
in the secondary arms, only measure force in one plane. Due to the 
arcuate movement of arms, the orientation of load cells in the the 
secondary arms changes continuously such that they measure different 
forces for the same nip levels at different wound roll diameters. Therefore, 
the roll diameter and machine geometry must be known, along with the 
load cell reading, in order to calculate the nip level. Other efforts to 
measure nip load and control the nip load by the use of load cells have 
problems with the mechanical mounting of the load cells. In many 
instances, the load cells are damaged to the where they do not function.  
 It is desirable to be able to control the nip level between the winding 
drum and the roll of paper at all times during the winding cycle, and to do 
this, it is necessary to
