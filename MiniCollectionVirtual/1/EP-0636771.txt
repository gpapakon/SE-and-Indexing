<ABSTRACT>
The operation of a catalyst (3) can be monitored using a two part test. 
An engine management system is arranged to perturb the oxygen 

concentration of the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine (1) 
such that an oxygen concentration of the gas entering the catalyst (3) 

varies between oxygen rich and oxygen deficient. A first test involves 
counting the number of transitions of the gas leaving the catalyst 

between two predetermined oxygen concentrations in response to a 
predetermined number of transitions of the gas entering the catalyst. A 

second test is performed if the first test indicates the catalyst to be faulty. 
The second test involves forming an integral of the oxygen concentration 

of the gas leaving the catalyst and correcting the integral for gas flow 
through the catalyst (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for monitoring 
the operation of a catalyst. The catalyst may, for example, be included 
within the exhaust system of an internal combustion engine. US 5, 158, 059 relates to a method detecting abnormality in an internal 
combustion engine by perturbing an air-fuel ratio coefficient. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
method of monitoring operation of a catalyst, comprising perturbing the 
oxygen concentration of gas entering the catalyst such that the oxygen 
concentration varies between first and second concentrations, forming an 
integral of the oxygen concentration of the gas leaving the catalyst during 
a period in which the oxygen concentration of the gas leaving the catalyst 
varies between a third concentration and a fourth concentration in response 
to the perturbation, forming a measure of gas flow through the catalyst 
during the integration and correcting the result of the integration for gas 
flow so as to provide a measure of performance of the catalyst. It is thus possible to provide a measure of the ability of a catalyst to store 
oxygen and to correct this measure for changes in exhaust gas flow rate due 
to engine speed and load. Preferably the catalyst is a three-way catalyst. Advantageously an engine management system is arranged to perturb the 
air-fuel ratio of the engine such that the oxygen concentration of the gas  
 
entering the catalyst repeatedly alternates between the first and second 
oxygen concentrations.  
 Preferably the measurement of the oxygen concentration of gas leaving 
the catalyst is clamped between upper and lower thresholds. Preferably the upper threshold is less than the third concentration. Advantageously the integration may be initiated on the transition of the 
gas entering the catalyst from being oxygen rich to being oxygen 
deficient. As an alternative, the time taken for the oxygen concentration of the gas 
leaving the catalyst to change between the third and fourth 
concentrations may be used as an integral of the oxygen concentration of 
the gas leaving the catalyst A first embodiment of the method of monitoring the performance of a 
catalyst, may comprise: 
a first step of integrating the oxygen concentration of gas leaving 
the catalyst while the oxygen concentration of gas entering the catalyst is 
less than a first predetermined threshold; a second step of repeating step one for a predetermined number 
of transitions of the oxygen level of the gas
