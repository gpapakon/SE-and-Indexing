<ABSTRACT>
A closure system (10) is disclosed including a container neck (14) 
extending axially from a container and a cap and spout 

assembly (12) for snap-on receipt onto the container neck. The 
cap and spout assembly includes a snap-on spout (22) having a 

resiliently flexible sealing ring (32) adapted for sealing receipt 
onto the container neck. The snap-on cap (20) includes a closure 

member (24) for closure of the spout and an interlocking ring (26) 
adapted for interlocking receipt onto the container neck over 

the sealing ring independent of the snap-on spout. The 
closure member is frangibly attached to the interlocking ring 

to provide tamper-evident means for the snap-on cap. The 
interlocking ring of the cap cooperates with the sealing ring 

of the spout to maintain a positive seal against the 
container neck regardless of the internal pressure within the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a closure system for 
a container that includes a snap-on cap and spout assembly 
for receipt onto a container neck and, more specifically, to 
a cap and spout assembly and method for assembling the cap 
and spout assembly onto a container wherein the cap and spout 
assembly includes a snap-on tamper evident cap and a snap-on 
pouring spout. Many types of closures for sealing onto a container neck 
are known that include a spout received onto the neck of a 
container and a cap for closure of the spout. Typically, the 
cap is threaded onto the spout, and the spout and/or cap is 
either threaded with the container neck or clamped onto the 
container neck via a separate crimping ring. For example, 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,236,629 to Dwinell, 4,632,282 to Nagashima 
and 4,568,006 to Mueller, et al. disclose various crimping 
ring arrangements for clamping the spout onto the container 
neck, wherein the crimping ring is constructed of a malleable 
metal. One disadvantage of this type of closure is that the 
metal crimping ring cannot be recycled together with the 
various plastic components and, therefore, must be removed 
from each container prior to recycling. Another disadvantage 
is that an additional assembly step is required to assemble 
the crimping ring onto the spout prior to assembly of the cap. As another example of a closure that seals onto a 
container neck, U.S. Patent No. 5,004,126 to Klesius 
discloses a plastic closure for a plastic container that 
includes a frame cap adapted to be screwed onto an externally 
threaded container neck over a flexible pouring spout. The 
frame cap is frangibly attached to and integral with a  
 
screw-on ring adapted to be threaded onto the externally 
threaded container neck. One disadvantage of this type of 
closure is the possibility of breaking the frame cap from the 
screw-on ring during threading of the ring onto the container 
neck. Although a flexible web is provided between the cap 
and ring to absorb excessive threading forces, excessive 
radial forces beyond those accommodated by the flexible web 
can nevertheless still result during assembly of the cap and 
ring onto the container neck so as to break the frangible cap 
and ring attachment, thereby defeating its tamper-evident 
function. Also, in many applications the tolerances of the 
container neck are not tightly controlled and depending on 
the tolerance stack of the cap, spout and container neck, the 
spout may prematurely seat onto the container neck such that
