<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with novel odorant compositions. 
More particularly, the invention is concerned with novel odorant 
compositions with prolonged diffusion after the application on the skin. It is well known that mixtures of perfume materials when deposited on 
the skin lose intensity and may change character with time, mainly due to 
factors such as differential evaporation and skin penetration. Many attempts have been made to minimize these drawbacks, but so far 
without notable success. Particularly, efforts have been made to prolong the 
diffusion, as well as to improve other characteristics of perfume materials, 
by e.g. increasing the perfume concentrate concentration or by using 
additives such as silicones, glycerol, polyethylene glycols and so on. Such 
perfume compositions, however, have never been really successful as the 
results obtained were only marginal. It thus actually existed a problem in this connection, which now has 
been overcome by the present invention. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the addition of panthenol ethyl 
ether, i.e. the compound of formula 
significantly improves and particularly prolongs diffusion of perfume 
materials from the skin, without notably modifying the olfactive note of the 
product. The present invention thus concerns odorant compositions 
comprising from about 70, conveniently from about 75, or even from about 80 
to about 99% of ethanol, from about 0.5 to about 30% of perfume concentrate,  
 
from about 0.1 to about 20% of panthenol ethyl ether and from about 0% to 
about 30% of water. The term "odorant composition", as used in connection with this 
invention, means solutions of perfume materials in alcohol and stands for 
well known commercial products such as e.g. Deo-Cologne, Eau de Cologne, 
Eau de Toilette, Perfume Extrait and so on. The term "perfume concentrate" stands for the required mixture of 
perfume materials of synthetic and/or natural origin. The term "panthenol" as used in connection with the present invention 
stands for DL-panthenol or for D-panthenol. The percentages referred to in the scope of the present invention are on 
a weight by weight basis. The amount of perfume concentrate and thus also the amount of 
ethanol present depends upon the respective odorant composition and can be 
easily determined by the skilled artisan. The amount of panthenol ethyl 
ether can also vary within a range of from about 0.1 to about 20%, but lies 
preferably in the range of from about 0.5 to about 5%. By way of examples,
