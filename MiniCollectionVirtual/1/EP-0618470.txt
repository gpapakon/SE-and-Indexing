<ABSTRACT>
An image pickup optical system having an image pickup lens system (5) 
having in turn a plurality of lenses arranged in multiple stages for forming an 

image of an object on an image plane of an image pickup device is disclosed. The 
image pickup optical system includes a double refraction plate (6) arranged 

downstream of the image pickup lens system (5), a diaphragm unit (3), as a first 
optical unit, for determining the F-number of the image pickup lens system by a 

diaphragm aperture (A), and a second optical unit (r12,r13,r16). When the F 
number is equal to a pre-set value Fd or less, the second optical unit (r12,r13,r16) 

operates in conjunction with the double refraction plate (6) for lowering the 
modulation transfer function (MTF) by the aberration due to an aspherical surface 

for a range of the spatial frequency not less than the cut-off frequency rc. 
Sufficient spurious signal suppressive effects may be obtained even if the optical 

low-pass filter is constituted by a sole double refraction plate, such as a quartz 
plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image pickup optical system employed in an
image pickup device, such as a video camera. More particularly, it relates to an
image pickup device for forming an image of an object on an image pickup surface
of an image pickup device.In general, in a solid-state image pickup device having a discrete pixel
structure, or an image pickup optical system having an image tube, in turn, having
a color separation filter, an image of an object is processed with optical spatial
sampling for generating an image output.The degree of fineness of a picture pattern that can be handled by such image
pickup optical system is determined in connection with the sampling frequency
and, if spatial frequency components higher than the sampling frequency are
contained in the picture pattern, spurious signals known as moire or aliasing tends
to be produced. For this reason, it becomes necessary to arrange an optical low
pass filter for limiting the high spatial frequency components of the object in the
image pickup optical system.As such optical low-pass filter, an optical low-pass filter taking advantage of
double refraction of a quartz plate has been employed. The optical low-pass filter
by the quartz plate affords optical blur by double refraction proper to the quartz
plate for reducing high spatial frequency components of the object image for
suppressing spurious signals.As an example of the optical low-pass filter employing such quartz plate,
there is known an optical low-pass filter employing three quartz plates, as
proposed by JP Patent Kokai Publication No.57-39683(1982).The MTF - spatial frequency characteristics of an optical low-pass filter
employing three quartz plates and an optical low-pass filter employing a sole
low-pass filter are explained in connection with Figs.1 and 2. The optical low
pass filter employing three quartz plates are low in MTF values for a frequency not
less than the cut-off frequency of 80 lp/mm, as shown in Fig.1, such that it has
sufficient spurious signal inhibiting effects. Conversely, the optical low-pass filter
employing a sole low-pass filter has larger MTF values for a frequency not less
than the cut-off frequency of 80 lp/mm, as shown in Fig.2, such that it has only
poor effects in inhibiting spurious signals. Consequently, the conventional practice has been to arrange the optical low pass
filter with three or more quartz plates to suppress the MTF for the frequency higher than
the cut-off frequency.However, since the optical low-pass filter in the
