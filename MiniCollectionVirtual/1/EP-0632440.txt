<ABSTRACT>
A chassis (100) is slidably provided with a 
circular-arc control slide (430) bulging toward a rotary 

cylinder (800) and having projections (471)(472) spaced 
apart from each other. Reel supports (200a)(200b) and a 

reel drive mechanism are arranged on the curving-in side 
of the slide (430). Disposed on the path of movement of 

the slide (430) is a drive cam gear (740) formed with cam 
grooves (741)(745) each extending from an outer 

peripheral opening toward its center. The slide (740) is 
formed thereon with a toothed projection (473) which 

meshes with the cam gear (740) during a period after one 
of the projections (471) is fitted in the corresponding 

cam groove (741) and until the other projection (472) is 
fitted in the corresponding cam groove (745). The slide 

(430) is further formed with a cam groove (474) having 
engaged therein a soft brake lever (251) for giving a 

light load to the reel support (200b) in REV mode, a 
brake lever (521) for lightly braking a capstan motor 

(500) in SLOW mode, a tension regulator lever (940) for 
lightly braking the reel support (200b) in FF/REW mode, 

and a withdrawing lever (350) for withdrawing a magnetic 
tape (601) from a cassette (600) for loading to operate 

these levers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording-reproduction
apparatus for recording and reproducing
signals with use of a magnetic tape, and more particulary
to tape loading and a loading drive mechanism.Conventional recording-reproduction apparatus
of the type mentioned wherein a magnetic tape is used
include the one disclosed in JP-A-1-220164 and JP-A-1-220165.
The present invention provides an improvement over
this conventional apparatus, so that the conventional
apparatus will be described first briefly. In the
following description, the direction in which the
cassette is loaded into the apparatus will be referred
to as the "front," and the direction of unloading of
the cassette as the "rear."With reference to FIGS. 33 to 38B, the
apparatus has a rotary cylinder 800 and a pair of reel
supports 200a, 200b which are mounted on a chassis 100.
The reel support 200a on the supply side has a band 722
wound therearound. The band 722 has one end attached 
to the chassis 100 and another end attached to a tension
lever 720 which is movable about a pivot 725 on the
chassis 100. The tension lever 720 is biased counterclockwise
by a spring 723 into pressing contact with a
leading guide block 804 for withdrawing a magnetic tape
from a cassette.Disposed in the rear of the two reel supports
200a, 200b is a control slide 830 which is sliable
rightward and leftward. A bell crank 831 in contact
with a cam portion 830a of the control slide 830 causes
a lever 832 to move the tension lever 720 with the
sliding movement of the control slide 830. The slide
830 has a right end linked to a control plate 811
slidable forward and rearward on the chassis 100. The
control plate 811 is connected to an intermediate plate
815 provided on the rear side of the chassis 100. A
pin 812 extending upward from the intermediate plate 815
is fitted in a cam groove 444 of a first cam gear 440
provided at a front end portion of the chassis 100 on
the rear side thereof.The reel supports 200a, 200b mesh respectively
with intermediate gears 221, 222, and brake levers
241a, 241b bear on these gears 221, 222, respectively.
A spring 255 causes the brake levers 241a, 241b to give
a braking load to the intermediate gears 221, 222. One end of a slide piece 932 positioned
between the control slide 830 and the upper surface
of the chassis 100 is opposed to one of the brake
levers, 241b. The slide piece 932 is perpendicular
to and engaged with an intermediate slide 931 interposed
between the chassis 100 and the control plate 811.
The slide 931 is in contact
