<ABSTRACT>
A table tennis table having a supporting frame (10) is described in which the connection between supporting frame (10) and table tennis top (12) is effected via a large number of damping elements (11) such that at least natural frequencies of the table tennis top (12) below about 150 to 180 hertz virtually do not occur.

Table tennis table substantially consisting of a table tennis 
top and a support frame, characterised thereby that the table tennis 

top (12) and support frame (10) are connected together by a plurality 
of damping elements (11) in such a manner that at least natural 

frequencies of the table tennis top below about 150 to 180 Hertz 
virtually do not arise. 
Table tennis table according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the table tennis top (12) and support frame (10) have 

approximately the same bending stiffness. 
Table tennis table according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the bending stiffness of the support frame (10) is larger than 

that of the table tennis top (12). 
Table tennis table according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby that a field division of the support frame (10) 

is present in the ratio n1/m, n2/m and n3/m, wherein m has at least 
the value 4 and is larger than n and the sum of the individual values 

for n1, n2 and n3 in turn yields m. 
Table tennis table according to claim 4, characterised thereby 
that the support frame (10) has transverse struts (13) which divide 

up the overall length of the top halves respectively in the ratio 
2:9, 3:9 and 4:9. 
Table tennis table according to claim 4, characterised thereby 
that the support frame (10) has transverse struts (13) which divide 

up the overall length of the top halves respectively in the ratio 
1/5 : 2/5 : 2/5. 
Table tennis table according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised thereby that a plurality of transverse struts (13) and 

longitudinal struts are present, wherein the field division of the 
support frame (10) resulting therefrom is 2/9 : 3/9 : 4/9.  

 
Table tennis table according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised thereby that a plurality of transverse struts (13) and 

longitudinal struts are present, wherein the field division of the 
support frame (10) resulting therefrom is 3/15 : 5/15 : 7/15. 
Table tennis table according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised thereby in the case of the damping elements (11) there 

are concerned such of foam material with open pores. 
Table tennis table according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised thereby in the case of the damping elements (11) there 

are concerned such damping synthetic material, wherein these are 
connected with the table tennis top (12) or support frame (10) by way 

of a screw connection (14) and/or by way of synthetic material 
moulded parts (15).
