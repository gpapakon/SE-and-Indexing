Method of data compression in the storage
and/or transmission of digital audio signals, in

which a digital audio signal is mapped from the
time domain into the frequency domain before

storage and/or transmission with the aid of a
filter bank, and irrelevant or redundant

information is eliminated from the signal in the
frequency domain using the psycho-acoustic masking

effect, in which method the signal is quantized
and encoded with variable word length, coding with

different Huffmann code tables being used as the
code of variable word lengths, and in which method

the signal is decoded after retrieval from the
memory and/or transmission and mapped from the

frequency domain into the time domain,

characterised in that
 the mapping of the audio
signal with a filter bank comes about with perfect

reconstruction, in that the psycho-acoustic
masking effect is at the maximum only half

exploited, in that in the encoding it is first of
all decided into which domain the value to be

encoded falls and according to this domain the
code word is allocated by means of the appropriate

Huffmann code table, in that, if the quantized
value exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the

portion exceeding the threshold is encoded in
scalar manner, and in that, to calculate the

masking effects, instead of the curve of the
masked thresholds, a curve with at least double

edge steepness is used.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 a masking threshold is used for noise-like
signals, which lies at least 14dB below the signal

amplitude. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 2,

characterised in that
 a modified discreet cosine
transformation (MDCT) is used as the filter bank.
Method according to claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 the MDCT is used with a block length of 256
or 512 sampled values.
Method according to claims 3 or 4,

characterised in that
 an analysis window of 512 or
1024 sampled values is provided.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the arriving audio signals
are optionally sampled with a sampling frequency

of 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz or 96 kHz.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the coded signal is post-processed,

for example faded out or faded in.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 up to 48 channels are
processed in parallel.
