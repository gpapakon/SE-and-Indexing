<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flame-retardants, and in
particular to non-halogen-containing compounds suitable
for use in flame-retardant additives for polyolefins
and other types of polymer materials.Electrical fires in machinery frequently arise as
a result of an electrical fault causing ignition and
combustion of polymer materials, such as the insulating
cladding of wires and cables. Such fires are a serious
problem presenting a potential hazard to both workers
and property, not only from the fire, but also from the
evolution of toxic gases derived from the thermal
degradation of the polymer materials. The problem may
be compounded when access to the point of ignition is
physically restricted, e.g., within machines,,
circuitry etc., thereby limiting manual attempts to
extinguish or even recognize the fire. Accordingly,
there has been much interest in the development of
polymer compositions having improved resistance to
combustion.It is known that blending certain compounds into a
prepolymer composition can have a flame-retarding
effect on the combustion of the final product.
Halogen-containing flame-retardant additives are known
and have been used to reduce the flammability of
polymer materials. However, there is an increasing
awareness of the problems associated with the use of
halogenated flame-retardants. For example, halogenated
flame-retardants are known to cause both high smoke
generation and the emission of toxic gases which
present a hazard to both workers and fire fighters 
alike, as well as corrosive gases which may damage
adjacent circuitry. In addition, these gases may also
have wider reaching deleterious environmental effects.
Alternatives to halogenated flame-retardants can be
broadly classed into either (a) phosphorus-based
materials or (b) non-phosphorus-based materials.Most non-phosphorus-based materials comprise inert
filler materials, such as calcium carbonate, which have
little anticombustion effect. Alumina trihydrate,
magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate have been
used as flame-retardant additives for polyolefin
polymers. Unfortunately, such materials require high
loading by weight of the polymer composition to achieve
the desired level of flammability performance. This
high loading is found to have a pronounced negative
effect on the physical properties of the polymer, e.g.,
tensile strength and/or elongation. Additionally,
materials such as alumina trihydrate have poor thermal
stability.The use of phosphorus-based flame-retardants is
known, particularly the use of inorganic
