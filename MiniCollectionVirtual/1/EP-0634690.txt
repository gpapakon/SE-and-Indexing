<ABSTRACT>
A light-sensitive silver halide photographic emulsion is 
disclosed, wherein at least 70% of the total projected area of 

silver halide grains are tabular grains having an average 
aspect ratio of a diameter to a thickness of 2 or more, an 

average value of the longest distances between two or more 

parallel twin planes contained in the respective tabular 
grains is 0.008 µm or more, and a variation coefficient of the 

longest distances between parallel twin planes is 35% or less, 
and wherein the silver halide emulsion is spectrally 

sensitized with a substantially slightly water-soluble 
sensitizing dye by adding the dye to the emulsion in the form 

of a dispersion of solid particles dispersed in an aqueous 
solution substantially free from an organic solvent or 

surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for spectrally sensitising a tabular light-sensitive
silver halide photographic emulsion and to a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material using the thus prepared emulsion,
especially a medical radiographic silver halide photographic
light-sensitive material.
More specifically, the present
invention relates to a process for spectrally sensitising a tabular light-sensitive silver halide
photographic emulsion to provide an emulsion having high sensitivity and excellent
properties such as low residual coloring, high image sharpness
and high pressure resistance and to a silver halide photographic
light-sensitive material using the sensitised emulsion. Increasing the sensitivity of light-sensitive silver
halide photographic emulsions is the most effective means of
improving various characteristics of photographic light-sensitive
materials. For example, high-speed color
photographic light-sensitive materials currently used have
been realized by increasing the sensitivity of photographic
emulsions. With respect to image quality, it is also well
known that graininess can be improved by the use of smaller
silver halide grains with an enhanced sensitivity. Further,
in the manufacture of radiographic light-sensitive materials,
a technique for improving the sensitivity of light-sensitive
silver halide photographic emulsions is not dispensable for
securing a desired sensitivity with the sharpness kept high by
cutting down crossover light. Therefore, various studies have
so far been made in the industry for the purpose of raising
the sensitivity of light-sensitive silver halide photographic
emulsions.In recent years, there are disclosed a variety of
techniques which use tabular silver halide grains for the
purpose of raising the sensitivity, and examples thereof can
be seen in Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. Nos. 111935/1983,
111936/1983, 111937/1983, 113927/1983, 99433/1984, etc.Further, Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. No. 92942/1988
discloses a technique to provide cores of high silver iodide 
content inside tabular silver halide grains, and Japanese Pat.
O.P.I. Pub. No. 151618/1988 discloses a technique which uses
hexagonal tabular silver halide grains; favorable results are
reported on both the techniques.Furthermore, techniques relating to the composition
distribution of tabular silver halide grains are disclosed in
Japanese Pat. O.P.I. Pub. Nos. 106746/1988, 183644/1989 and
279237/1989. With respect to the crystal structure of tabular
silver halide grains, there are
