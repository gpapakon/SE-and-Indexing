<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic chuck (113) having grooves (130, 132, 134) 
to uniformly distribute a heat transfer medium, e.g., a 

gas, and a method of fabricating such an electrostatic 
chuck. Specifically, a grooved layer (112) is formed upon a 

surface (110) of a conventional chuck body (111). 
Typically, a conventional chuck body contains a substrate 

(100) having one or more electrodes (104, 106) deposited 
thereupon and a first layer (108), typically formed of an 

insulating material, disposed over the electrodes and a 
surface of the substrate which supports the electrodes. A 

second layer (112), typically formed of an insulating 
material, is formed by screen printing a paste of 

insulating material over a surface of the first layer. The 
paste is applied in a pattern which includes at least one 

gap. After curing the paste into a hard layer, the second 
layer contains the gap or gaps defined by the screen 

pattern. The combination of the surface of the first layer 
and the gaps in the second layer define a grooved surface 

pattern. The second layer supports a workpiece during 
subsequent workpiece processing. A hole (216) through the 

substrate and the first layer provides a portal through 
which a gas can be pumped into the grooves. With this 

arrangement, the medium promotes substantially uniform heat 
exchange between the workpiece and the electrostatic chuck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrostatic 
chuck for retaining a workpiece, particularly, such a 
chuck having a grooved insulating layer which supports 
the workpiece, and a method of fabricating this chuck. In general, chucks are used in various 
material processing systems to retain workpieces, such 
as semiconductor wafers or dielectric substrates, in a 
mechanically stationary position while such a system 
processes the workpiece. In particular, during 
semiconductor wafer processing, chucks are used to 
position a substrate of semiconductor material within a 
vacuum chamber while the substrate undergoes one or 
more process steps for creating integrated circuits on 
the substrate. As is well known in the art, such 
process steps include, for example, ion implantation, 
sputtering, plasma etching, or chemical vapor 
deposition. Generally, during processing, the 
semiconductor wafer is repeatedly heated and cooled 
while undergoing various process steps. Typically, all 
of the process steps are accomplished in a vacuum 
chamber having a relatively high vacuum. Because a 
vacuum does not provide heat conduction or convection,  
 
a vacuum environment provides limited heat transfer 
from the wafer. Conventionally, to improve heat 
conduction from the wafer, the wafer rests upon a 
massive, heat conductive pedestal, typically formed of 
a metallic material. Additionally, the periphery of 
the wafer may be mechanically clamped to the pedestal. 
One or more grooves are often formed in the surface of 
the pedestal which faces the wafer. These grooves are 
typically produced in a defined pattern by 
appropriately machining the surface of the pedestal. 
To provide a spatially uniform conductive heat transfer 
from the wafer to the pedestal, a heat transfer medium, 
typically a gas such as helium, is pumped into the 
grooves. These grooves act as flow conduits which 
uniformly distribute the heat transfer medium along the 
surface of the wafer that faces the pedestal. Such a 
conductive heat transfer process is commonly referred 
to as a "gas assisted heat transfer". Such gas 
assisted heat transfer is disclosed by Tsui in European 
published patent application 0 397 315, and which is 
incorporated herein by reference. Gas assisted heat transfer between a 
workpiece and a pedestal usually relies upon equipment 
which mechanically clamps a wafer to a pedestal, i.e., 
a mechanical chuck. Such a mechanical chuck is 
disclosed by Morley in United States Patent 4,603,466, 
and which is incorporated herein by
