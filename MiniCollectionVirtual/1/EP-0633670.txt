<ABSTRACT>
In a method for obtaining the frame clock at the receiving end of a band-limited transmission channel via which digital signals are transmitted which are sampled at the receiving end, the pulse response of the transmission channel to a known input signal is measured as a sequence of numbers of finite length at predetermined time intervals and the frame clock is synchronised to the first path in time of a number of successive channel impulse responses, the first path in time being an element in the sequence of numbers of a channel impulse response which is the first one in time to meet a predetermined criterion. As a result, fluctuations in the frame clock which are caused by multi-path propagation are avoided to the greatest possible extent.

reception side, characterized in that a data sequence known at

the reception side is transmitted on the communications
