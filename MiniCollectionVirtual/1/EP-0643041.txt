<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing isocyanic acid, characterized 
in that cyanuric acid is brought into contact at temperatures 

of from 300 to 600°C with an aluminium catalyst, 
after which the isocyanic acid formed is isolated or used 

directly for further reaction. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the aluminium catalyst used is a catalyst containing 

aluminium oxide as active component. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the aluminium catalyst used is aluminium oxide. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the aluminium catalyst is used 

without a support. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that solid cyanuric acid is mixed with 

the aluminium catalyst and is heated to temperatures of 
from 300 to 600°C. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that gaseous cyanuric acid, with or 

without a carrier gas which is inert under the reaction 
conditions, is passed over the aluminium catalyst. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a fluidized-bed reactor is initially 

charged with aluminium catalyst particles and a 
fluidized bed is built up by blowing in a carrier gas 

which is inert under the reaction conditions, into which 
bed the solid or gaseous cyanuric acid is introduced. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the reaction is carried out at 

temperatures of from 320 to 450°C. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the gas formed, which contains the 

isocyanic acid, is admixed with a gaseous tertiary amine 
and the adduct of isocyanic acid and tertiary amine which 

is formed is condensed in an inert diluent. 
Use of an aluminium catalyst for preparing isocyanic 
acid from cyanuric acid.
