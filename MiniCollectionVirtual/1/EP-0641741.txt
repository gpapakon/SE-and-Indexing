A process for the removal of cobalt impurities 
from zinc sulphate solution is disclosed. The process 

comprises the step of carrying out cementation of the 
cobalt impurities on zinc dust in a high pressure vessel 

at a temperature between 98°C and about 150°C, preferably 
between 120 and 130°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
removal of cobalt impurities from zinc sulphate solutions 
which are used in the electrolytic recovery of zinc. In the practice of electrowinning of zinc, return 
acid from the electrolysis is used to leach the zinc 
calcine. The obtained product is an impure zinc sulphate 
solution containing about 150 g/L of zinc and varying 
amounts of the components present in the concentrate. The 
presence of impurities in the electrolyte renders 
impossible the zinc deposition process from the impure 
feed solution thus necessitating a purification stage 
prior to the electrowinning of zinc. The conventional method of purifying the impure 
feed solution consists of cementing the impurities such as 
copper, cadmium and cobalt with zinc powder. The kinetics 
of the cementation reaction are favourable for the copper 
and cadmium while for the cobalt reaction, about 600 times 
the stoichiometric requirements for zinc powder is needed 
to efficiently remove this impurity from the electrolyte. 
Use of reaction additives, such as Sb₂O₃ or As₂O₃, and 
long retention times (2.5 h) are also required while 
maintaining a solution temperature of 95°C, to ensure a 
residual cobalt concentration of less than 0.2 mg/L. The 
disadvantages of these systems are: 
a) Long retention times necessitating several 
purification reactors occupying a large  
 
surface area of the plant. b) High heating cost for maintaining the 
electrolyte at 95°C for 3.0 h of operation. Several purification methods have been developed 
to improve the efficiency of cementation reaction such as 
using vibratory reactors to increase the hydrodynamics of 
the system or by using different additives than Sb₂O₃ or 
As₂O₃, i.e., CuSo₄, SnSo₄ or PbSo₄. However, all these 
processes suffer from at least one of the above mentioned 
disadvantages. Moreover, these processes are costly to 
operate thus offering a non-economical solution to the 
problem of slow kinetics for the cobalt cementation 
reaction. It is therefore the object of the present 
invention to improve the rate of cementation with zinc 
dust and thus reduce the requirements for purification 
tanks. It is also an object of the present invention to 
reduce the zinc dust consumption for the cobalt 
cementation reaction. The process in accordance with the present 
invention consists in carrying out cementation of the 
cobalt impurities on zinc dust in a relatively high 
pressure vessel at a temperature between 98°C and about 
150°C, preferably between 120 and
