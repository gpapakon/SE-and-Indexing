<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a liquid crystal display device including 

first and second substrates (2, 52; 4, 54) each having 
a transparent electrode (12, 62, 17, 69) on an inner 

surface thereof, a color filter (18, 68) provided on 
said first substrate (2, 52) and having a plurality of 

color portions (36, 86) formed thereon, a liquid 
crystal composition (6, 56) sandwiched between the 

first and second substrates (2, 52; 4, 54), and driving 
means for applying a voltage to said first and second 

substrates (2, 52; 4, 54). This method comprises the 
steps of: (a) forming at least one coating layer (28, 

78, 67) on at least one light-transmitting substrate 
(8, 58, 60) of said first and second substrates (2, 52; 

4, 54); (b) forming at least one transparent electrode 
(12, 62, 69) with a predetermined shape on said coating 

layer (29, 78, 67); and (c) subjecting that region of 
said coating layer (29, 78, 67) which is not covered 

with said transparent electrode (12, 62, 68), to 
thermal treatment to be colored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
a liquid crystal display device and, more 
particularly, to a method of manufacturing a color 
filter for a liquid crystal display device. In recent years, a liquid crystal display device 
has been widely utilized as a display for, e.g., a television 
or office automation equipment. This is because 
a liquid crystal display device has advantages of, e.g., 
low power consumption and light weight. In a liquid 
crystal display device having the above advantages, a 
demand has arisen for achieving larger size and high-quality 
color display. With this demand, a color filter 
for a liquid crystal display device is regarded as an 
important unit. A conventional color filter for a liquid crystal 
display device has been manufactured by repeating the 
photolithography step. Since each pixel of the liquid 
crystal display device is extremely small, a high-precision 
color filter for the liquid crystal display 
device is required. In addition, the color filter must 
have excellent surface properties to form, e.g., an orientation 
film thereon. For this reason, high precision 
is required, and hence the manufacture by repeating the 
photolithography step results in poor productivity. In 
addition, the surface of the color filter must be flattened 
to form, e.g., an orientation film thereon. For  
 
this reason, cost of the liquid crystal display device 
is increased, and cost of an equipment including the 
liquid crystal display device is also extremely 
increased, as a matter of course. In order to eliminate the above drawbacks, a printing 
method which can achieve the manufacture of a liquid 
crystal display device at lower cost than that of a dyeing 
method has been considered. In the printing method, 
a color filter or the like is manufactured by printing. 
However, foreign matters such as dust easily enter a 
color filter manufactured by the printing method. In 
addition, the surface of the color filter tends to be 
uneven due to the manufacturing method by printing. If 
the surface of the color filter is extremely uneven, it 
is difficult to form a transparent electrode or an orientation 
film on the color filter, thus easily degrading 
the display quality. For this reason, the conventional 
color filter manufactured by printing is impractical in 
spite of low cost. In order to solve the above problems, a method is 
disclosed in JP-A-61-3123. 
According to this method, 
since the surface of a color portion formed by printing 
is polished and
