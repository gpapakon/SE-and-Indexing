<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phenylalkanoic acid 
derivatives useful as pharmaceuticals which have 
excellent anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions and 
high safety, particularly remarkable effects on 
chronic inflammations. Further, it relates to a 
process for producing the phenylalkanoic acid 
derivatives in a good yield and also to a process for 
separating optical isomers thereof in an excellently 
selective manner. Furthermore, it relates to an anti-inflammatory 
agent, an analgesic agent and externally-used 
preparation which each contains said 
phenylalkanoic acid derivative as an effective 
ingredient. Phenylalkanoic acid derivatives which have 
heretofore been known, are disclosed respectively in 
Japanese Patent Gazette No. Sho 58-4699 or 4699/83 
(hereinafter referred to as Prior Art 1) and Japanese 
Pat. Appln. Laid-Open Gazette No. Sho 54-103852 or

methyl)phenylacetic acid, 2-[4-(2-oxocyclohexane-1-yl 
methyl)phenyl]propionic 
acid, 4-(2-oxocyclohexane-1-yl methyl)phenylacetic 
acid and the like and reports that these compounds 
have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antifebrile 
actions. On the other hand, the Prior Art 2 widely 
describes phenylacetic acid derivatives represented by 
the following formula (P) 
 
wherein m is an integer of 1-5, >A-B- is >CH-CH2-, 
>C=CH- or >CH-CO-, R5 is a hydrogen atom, halogen 
atom, trifluoromethyl group, nitro group or amino 
group, R6 and R7 are each a hydrogen atom or lower 
alkyl group or they together form an ethylene group, 
X3 is two hydrogen atoms or oxo, and Y5 is cyano, 
hydroxyamidocarbonyl, carbamoyl, 5-tetrazolyl, 
carboxyl, a salt thereof with a physiologically 
acceptable base, an ester thereof with a  
 
physiologically safe alcohol or an amide thereof with 
a physiologically safe amine. The general formula (P) in the Prior Art 2 
prima facie partly covers the phenylalkanoic acid 
derivatives of this invention, but the Prior Art 2 
only describes concretely, as compounds similar to the 
derivatives of this invention, 2-(4-cyclopentylmethylphenyl)-propionic 
acid, 4-(cyclopentylmethyl)-phenylacetic 
acid, 2-(3-chloro-4-cyclopentylmethylphenyl)-propionic 
acid, 2-(4-cyclohexylmethylphenyl)-propionic
