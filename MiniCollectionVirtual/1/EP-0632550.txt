<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to modulation of 
laser diodes, for example to a distributed feed-back 
laser diode module containing an integrated modulator, 
in which an optical modulator is used to modulate light 
output from a semiconductor laser diode. In an optical communication system, light output 
from a semiconductor laser diode is modulated by 
applying a drive signal, and the modulated light is 
input into an optical fiber. The light signal is 
detected at the opposite end of the optical fiber. Optical communication can provide a high 
transmission speed because of the high frequency of 
light itself, and the excellent monochromaticity of 
light generated by a semiconductor laser diode; that 
is, the excellent stability in frequency of the light. 
Nevertheless, there is a demand for a higher 
transmission speed. In typical digital optical 
communication, the longer the transmission distance is, 
the more critical the monochromaticity of the light 
becomes. For optical communication, therefore, a 
distributed feedback (DFB) type semiconductor laser 
diode, which includes a diffraction grating has been 
employed. However, when the light from a semiconductor laser 
diode is modulated by a digital signal, the actual 
light output fluctuates. Therefore, even when a 
semiconductor laser diode having a DFB structure is 
employed, the wavelength characteristic of the light 
changes. When the wavelength extends, transmission 
time differs in optical fibers due to the dispersion 
characteristics of the optical fibers. The 
transmittable signal frequency is restricted 
accordingly. In an effort to minimize the foregoing extension 
in wavelength of the output light, an optical 
semiconductor device in which a modulator is provided  
 
to modulate light output of the semiconductor laser 
diode has been proposed. In this optical semiconductor 
device, since current flowing through the semiconductor 
laser diode is constant, the semiconductor laser diode 
should emit constant output light whose wavelength does 
not extend. The output light is emitted into the 
optical modulator adjoining the semiconductor laser 
diode. The optical modulator transmits the input light 
in a normal state, but it does not transmit the input 
light when a reverse voltage is applied to P-N junction 
of the modulator. This type of optical modulator is 
called an electro-absorption modulator, and this type 
of optical semiconductor device is called a Modulator 
Integrated Distributed Feedback Laser Diode 
(MI-DFB-LD). An embodiment
