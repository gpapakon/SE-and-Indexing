<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the synthesis of 
oligonucleotides and to novel compounds which may be used 
during operation of the method. Oligonucleotide sequences are routinely synthesised for 
use as linkers, adaptors, building blocks for synthetic genes, 
synthetic regulatory sequences, probes, primers and other 
purposes and a number of methods have been developed for 
producing such sequences. These methods rely on the initial 
attachment of a first suitably protected nucleoside to a solid 
support by a cleavable linkage followed by sequential reactions 
of precursors of individual nucleotides to the growing 
oligonucleotide strand with each addition of a precursor 
involving a number of chemical reactions. At present the 
method most generally employed for the production of a lone 
oligonucleotide is based on phosphoramidite chemistry. This is 
fully described by Caruthers et al in Tetrahedron Letters 1981, 
22, (20) pp 1859-62, by Koster et al in US Patent 4725677 and 
by M.J. Gait ('Oligonucleotide Synthesis, a Practical 
Approach', IRL Press Oxford p35-81). EP-A-67597 discloses a 
process of incorporating ribonucleotide units at locations in 
DNA. These provide predetermined cleavage sites allowing ease 
of chain cleavage from the solid support and a mechanism for 
separating the product from unwanted products. Several types of automated DNA synthesisers are now 
commercially available which enable an oligonucleotide to be 
prepared using phosphoramidite chemistry. An illustrative 
description of how a lone oligonucleotide may be formed by 
sequential reactions of precursors of the individual 
nucleotides on a support is provided in the protocol for the 
Applied Biosystems DNA Synthesiser Model 380B, particularly 
Section 2 thereof, which is incorporated herein by reference 
thereto. In response to the rapid increase in demand for  
 
oligonucleotides, improvements are desirable which will 
increase the throughput of commercial synthesisers, i.e. 
increase the number of oligonucleotides synthesised per day. We have now developed a rapid and efficient method for 
the production of oligonucleotides in which more than one 
oligonucleotide can be synthesised on the same support using a 
cleavable linker moiety introduced as required in a growing 
oligonucleotide chain. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a method for the synthesis of a plurality of 
oligonucleotides comprising the steps of: (i) forming a first 
oligonucleotide on a first cleavable link
