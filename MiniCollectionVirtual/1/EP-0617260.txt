<ABSTRACT>
In a level sensor for vehicles, having two interconnected components which are arranged movably with respect to one another, one component being connected to the vehicle chassis and the other component being connected to the wheel suspension, and having a measuring device for determining the change in position between the components, the measuring device is, in order to create a sensor which has a small constructional size, allows movement in space and generates the most accurate measurement results possible, a magnetoresistive sensor consisting of a magnetic-field-sensitive sensor (F) and a permanent magnet (P), the components are connected to one another by a ball joint consisting of a ball socket (KP) and a ball head (KK) inserted into the ball socket, and the magnetic-field-sensitive sensor (F) and the permanent magnet (P) are arranged located opposite one another in the ball head (KK) and in the area of the ball socket (KP).
