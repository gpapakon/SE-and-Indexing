<ABSTRACT>
The feed device (7) for a machine for spreading a road surfacing material, of the finishing machine (1) type or the like, is intended to be positioned at the front of the finisher (1). It includes a hopper (10) provided with a central opening (23) for withdrawal of the surfacing material by the finisher (1), and means (21) for lateral prespreading of the said material, the final spreading being carried out by the finisher (1) over the entire width thereof. The invention finds its application on public works sites.

Process for spreading road surfacing material on a strip 
with width L and thickness E, characterised in that: 


the surfacing material is firstly spread onto at 
least one pre-spreading zone (28), this pre-spreading 

being carried out to a width 2
l
 smaller than L and to a 
thickness 
e
 less than E, then 
surfacing material is spread to the width L over 
the pre-spreading zone or zones (28) and over the 

remainder of the width L up to thickness E, in order to 
form a finished strip of surfacing material with width L 

and thickness E. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that two 
lateral pre-spreading zones (28) are used. 
Feeding device (7) for a spreading machine for road 
surfacing material, such as a finisher (1) or similar, 

adjusted to ensure a spread of material over the entire 
width (L) to be surfaced, and to a determined thickness 

(E), said feeding device (7) being intended for 
positioning in front of the finisher (1) and comprising 

a hopper (10) fitted with an opening (23) for removal of 
the surfacing material through the finisher (1), and 

means (21) for pre-spreading said material to a width 
(2
l
) smaller than width (L) to be surfaced, these means 
comprising a transverse blade (20A), characterised in 

that the transverse blade (20A) is adjusted for 
regulation of the thickness of the pre-spread material 

to a value (e) less than said determined thickness (E). 
Feeding device (7) according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that said pre-spreading means (21) comprise at least 

one screw conveyor (21) disposed in the vicinity of at 
least one rear lateral part (16) of the hopper (10).  

 
Feeding device (7) according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that it comprises means (25) for conveying the 

material between the hopper (10) and the screw conveyor 
(21). 
Feeding device (7) according to Claim 4 or Claim 5, 
characterised in that said screw conveyor (21) can be 

controlled laterally in relation to the longitudinal 
axis of the feeding device (7). 
Feeding device (7) according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that the lateral control of said screw conveyor (21) 

is dependent on the control of the spreading width (L) 
of the finisher (1). 
Feeding device (7) according to any one of Claims 4 to 
7, characterised in that the transverse blade (20A) is 

provided behind the screw conveyor (21). 
Feeding device (7) according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that said means (25) of conveying the material are 

formed by at least one crossbar conveyor (25) disposed 
below at least one lateral opening (24) arranged in the 

lower wall (11) of the hopper (10). 
Feeding device (7) according to any one of Claims 3 to 
9, characterised in that said hopper (10) comprises a 

central opening (23) arranged in its lower wall (11), 
below which the conveying means (26) of the finisher 

come into position, feeding said finisher (1) with 
surfacing material. 
Feeding device (7) according to any one of Claims 3 to 
10, characterised in that it comprises independent  

 
driving means (9), in particular crawlers (9), actuated 

by drive means of the finisher. 
Feeding device (7) according to any one of Claims 3 to 
11, characterised in that, in front of the hopper (10), 

it comprises means (31) for receiving two trucks (3) 
side by side. 
Finisher (1) for spreading road surfacing material, 
characterised in that, in the vicinity of its front 

portion, it comprises a feeding device (7) according to 
any one of Claims 3 to 12. 
Finisher according to Claim 13, characterised in that 
the feeding device is integral to the finisher.
