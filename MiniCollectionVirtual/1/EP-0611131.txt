<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a light emitting diode (hereinafter referred
to as an 'LED'), and more particularly to a method for
producing an LED to be used for display and transmission
purposes.There has been a demand for a bright LED to
be used for many applications including a display
apparatus. One approach to make a bright LED is to
improve the external emission efficiency of the light
emitted inside an LED.An LED is made of semiconductor materials
having high refractive indices, e.g. approximately to
the order of 3.5, which means total reflection can
easily occur. Therefore, in the case where light is
emitted from one plane face of the LED, only light
which enters into the plane face at an angle less than
the critical angle can propagate to the outside.
Therefore, because of the total reflection, the external
emission efficiency of the LED is usually not so
high.A common method for improving the external
emission efficiency of an LED is to use a material
capable of transmitting the generated light for a
semiconductor substrate and to form a reflector on the
back-side of the semiconductor substrate. In such an
LED having a substrate transparent to the generated 
light, light reflected from the lower face of the
semiconductor substrate can be emitted from the upper
face, side faces, etc., whereas only the light emitted
from the upper face can be utilized in cases where the
semiconductor substrate is made of a material which
does not transmit the generated light. LEDs having a
substrate that is transparent to the generated light
are realized as infrared LEDs in which a semiconductor
material of an InGaAsP-type is used, infrared and red
LEDs in which a semiconductor material of an AlGaAs-type
is used, yellow LEds in which a semiconductor
material of a GaAsP-type is used, and green LEDs in
which a semiconductor material of a GaP-type is used.On the other hand, there have been developed
red, yellow, and green LEDs in which a semiconductor
material of an AlGaInP-type is used, and green and blue
LEDs in which a semiconductor material of a ZnCdSSe-type
is used. However, the above-mentioned technique
of forming the substrate with a material transparent
generated light is not applicable to these LEDs,
because the lattice-matching conditions are not satisfactory
in such applications. Moreover, the internal
emission efficiency of the above-mentioned LEDs, in the
case where a substrate that is opaque to generated
light is used, tends to decrease because the substrates
opaque to
