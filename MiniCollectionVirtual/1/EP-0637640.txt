<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for plating electrical or electronic 
components, comprises a plating chamber (2) for 

receiving electrolyte through which a current is to be 
passed via a first anode (10) and cathode (13) pair, 

means being provided to arrange a component (12) to be 
plated as the cathode of said first pair, means for 

supplying the plating chamber with electrolyte enriched 
with plating material, the supplying means including a 

reservoir chamber (4) for receiving electrolyte through 
which a current is to be passed via a second anode and 

cathode pair (21,22), means being provided to arrange a 
body of plating material (17) as the anode of said 

second pair, whereby in use plating material dissolved 
from the anode of the second pair enriches the 

electrolyte supplied to the plating chamber (2) and is 
deposited on the cathode of the first pair. The 

component (12) may be an integrated circuit strip 
package or the like, and may be carried during plating 

by a carrier (11) which comprises upper and lower 
supports for engaging respective longitudinal edges of 

the strip along the length thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for plating 
electrical or electronic components, such as the leads 
of integrated circuit packs. There are now becoming increasingly popular 
"plastic leadless chip carriers", known as "PLCCs", and 
"small outline integrated circuits" known as "SOICs". 
These are formed from "quad flat packs" which have a 
relatively flat body, rectangular in plan view, and with 
leads projecting from all four sides in the same plane 
as the flat body. The leads, normally of copper, are 
bent to the required shape so as to form either a PLCC 
or an SOIC. Current quad flat packs available may have 
5,7,11,13 or 17 or more leads along each side, and are 
generally square or rectangular or similarly shaped in 
plan view. The spacing between adjacent leads may be as 
small as 0.025 inches (0.64mm) and it is anticipated 
that it will be reduced even further. Such quad flat 
packs are typically provided in strip form with a 
continuous metal edge along each longitudinal edge of 
the strip. It is known to apply solder to the leads of such 
components after the leads have been bent to the 
required shape by immersion in a bath of molten solder. 
However, with the small spacing between adjacent leads 
referred to above the capillary action of the molten 
solder can cause the spacing to be bridged, resulting in 
a short circuit. As a consequence there has been a move 
to the use of electroplating as an alternative system of 
coating the leads of integrated circuit packs. Electroplating involves immersing a component in a 
bath of plating solution and forming an electric circuit 
with the leads of the component as the cathode and an 
anode made of the metal with which the leads are to be  
 
plated. As a current is passed through the system, the 
anode metal goes into solution and is gradually consumed 
whilst the cathode is plated by the metal provided by 
the anode. It is particularly desirable when plating the leads 
of electrical or electronic components for each lead to 
be uniformly plated by a layer having a thickness 
falling within a particular range. Industry 
requirements are becoming increasingly stringent and the 
thickness range presently specified is 300 to 700 micro-inches 
(0.0076 to 0.018mm). Above the lower limit, the 
plate thickness provides the lead with adequate 
protection, for example to pass the presently so-called 
16 hour reliability steam test. An upper limit is 
specified because if the plate is too thick then when 
the leads are bent to the required shape, the
