<ABSTRACT>
A composite video signal is formed in which high luminance frequencies are modulated so that they occupy frequencies above the chrominance band. A sub-band coder (102) is used to split the luminance frequency band into high and low frequencies at the coder, and an inverse sub-band coder (108) combines the high-frequency luminance and the chrominance components. The two resultant signals are applied to a phase-segregated Weston Clean PAL coder (120) to provide a composite video signal, which is compatible with a conventional PAL signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of video signal coding.The PAL composite video coding standard has a number of
limitations that restrict the picture quality that such a signal can
convey. These limitations are well known; they include limited
luminance and chrominance resolution, cross-color and cross-luminance.Several methods are known that aim at improving the image
quality that can be conveyed by a PAL signal. For example,
multidimensional filtering techniques may be employed to help to
separate chrominance and luminance information, as described in BBC
Research Department Report No. 1975/36, 'The filtering of luminance
and chrominance to avoid cross-color in a PAL color system'. This
approach reduces significantly the effects of cross-color and
cross-luminance but cannot eliminate them completely; it also
forces the use of luminance and chrominance passbands that have a
sub-optimum shape.Another known technique for improving the quality of a PAL
signal is the so-called phase-segregated or 'Weston' clean PAL, as
described in BBC Research Department Report No. 1980/1, 'Weston
clean PAL'; see also U.K. Patents GB-A-1 534 268,
GB-A-1 534 269 and GB-A-1 534 270. This coding
method separates luminance and chrominance information by phase
rather than frequency and thus allows perfect separation of the two
signals, eliminating cross effects. It also allows a significant
amount of flexibility in choosing the shapes of the passbands of the
luminance and chrominance signals. In particular, the luminance
part of the signal can carry samples at a rate of twice the color
subcarrier frequency with negligible crosstalk between samples,
allowing so-called spectrum-folding techniques to be used. However,
the overall spectral volume of the luminance signal is limited to
that equivalent to a signal having a bandwidth equal to the color
subcarrier frequency. The resolution of the chrominance signal may
however be increased by increasing the overall bandwidth of the
composite signal. A third technique has been proposed for use in situations
where the bandwidth of the composite signal may be increased above
the usual figure of about 5.5MHz. (The numerical values in this
specification are given by way of example and are based on the PAL
System I television standard.) This technique, known as Extended
PAL, is described in BBC Research Department Report No. 1981/11, 'An
Extended PAL system for high-quality television'; see also U.K.
