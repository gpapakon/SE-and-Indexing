<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for reversing the draw-off direction of a fibre sliver (7) deposited in loop form into a can (1). For specific treatment processes, such as, for example, combing, it is necessary for the individual fibres (F) to be present with head hooks. The number of process steps must therefore be adjusted accordingly, so that the tail hooks delivered by the card (K1-K3) and deposited into a can (1) are present as head hooks during combing. It is therefore proposed to rotate the fibre-sliver bundle (2) by tilting the can (1) through approximately 180 DEG  and to discharge it from the can (1). It is preferably proposed to discharge the fibre-sliver bundle (2) into a second container (3). To avoid damage to the sliver, it is proposed to compress the bundle (2) in the longitudinal direction before the tilting operation.
