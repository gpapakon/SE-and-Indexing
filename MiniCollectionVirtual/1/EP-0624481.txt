<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reversible heat-sensitive 
recording medium which enables the formation and 
erasing of an image to be reversibly repeatedly conducted 
by a heating means such as a thermal head. The demand for heat-sensitive recording mediums 
has rapidly increased with the spread of thermal heads in 
recent years. Magnetic information is often displayed as 
visible information on prepaid cards which are rapidly 
spread in the fields of communication, transportation, 
distribution, etc, in particular. Such magnetic cards are 
widely used as highway cards, prepaid cards in department 
stores, supermarkets, etc., and JR orange cards. However, the area on which visible information 
can be displayed is limited to only a part of the recording 
medium. For example, when the balance is recorded on a 
large denomination prepaid card, the case occurs that 
information is no more displayed. In this case, a new card 
is conventionally reissued. Accordingly, there is a 
problem that costs are increased. Studies have been made to provide a reversible 
recording medium which enables recording and erasing to be 
repeatedly conducted on the same area to overcome the  
 
above-described problem. When the recording medium is 
used, previous unnecessary information can be erased, and 
new information can be displayed. Accordingly, it is not 
necessary that a new card is reissued when display is no 
more made. Further, when the recording medium is used as, 
for example, facsimile paper, resources can be saved, and 
the recording medium can contribute to the solution of 
environmental problems. As the heat-sensitive recording mediums which 
enable the recording and erasing of information to be 
reversibly conducted, there have been conventionally 
proposed those having a heat-sensitive layer formed by 
dispersing an organic low molecular weight material such as 
a higher alcohol or a higher fatty acid in a resin matrix 
such as polyvinyl chloride, a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate 
copolymer, a polyester or a polyamide (see, JP-A-54-119377 
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application"), JP-A-55-154198 and 
JP-A-2-1363). The principle of forming an image on the 
reversible heat-sensitive recording medium and erasing it 
therefrom is based on that the transparency of the heat-sensitive 
layer is different when the temperature of the 
heat-sensitive layer is raised to a different temperature, 
and restored to room temperature. Namely, when the  
 
temperature of the
