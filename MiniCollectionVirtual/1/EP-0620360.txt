<ABSTRACT>
With reference to figure 1 the present 
invention relates to a tappet assembly (18) for valve 

control means for controlling a valve (10) of an 
internal combustion engine. The tappet assembly (18) 

is in use slidably mounted in a bore in the internal 
combustion engine. The tappet assembly (18) 

comprises a first tappet (20) which is engageable 
with a valve (10), a second tappet (21) which is 

engageable with a cam (26) and locking means (27) for 
connecting the first (21) and second (20) tappets. 

In use of the tappet assembly the valve (10) is 
controlled by the cam (26) engaged by the second 

tappet (21) only when the first (20) and second (21) 
tappets are connected by the locking members (27). 

The second tappet (21) is an outer tappet (21) and 

the first tappet (20) is a co-axial inner tappet (20) 
which is slidable in a bore in the outer tappet (21) 

when the first (21) and second (20) tappets are 
disconnected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tappet assembly for 
valve control means for controlling a valve of an 
internal combustion engine, the tappet assembly being 
operable to transmit reciprocating movement from cam 
means of the internal combustion engine to a valve of 
the internal combustion engine. Internal combustion engines for use in, for 
example, vehicles, must be capable of operation at 
various engine speeds and loads. The timing of the 
opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves 
must be set to optimise the power output and 
efficiency of the engine over a reasonable range of 
speeds and loads. For example, in a high output, multi-valve, 
spark ignition four stroke engine which is designed 
to operate at high engine speeds, it is generally 
desirable to provide means, such as cams, to control 
the opening of the inlet valves which preferably have 
a long valve opening period, in order to maximise the 
combustible charge drawn into the combustion chambers 
during the suction strokes of the engine. This has 
the advantage of improving the volumetric efficiency 
of the engine, thereby increasing the maximum power 
and torque outputs of the engine. However, if such an engine is operated at 
speeds below that at which maximum power is 
developed, since the inlet valves are open for a 
relatively long period, some of the combustible 
charge drawn into each combustion chamber on its 
suction stroke can be forced back through the valve 
before it closes. This effect clearly reduces the 
volumetric efficiency, and hence the output, of the  
 
engine. It also causes unstable engine idling and 
low speed operation, and also makes exhaust emissions 
more difficult to control. It is therefore desirable to additionally 
provide a valve control mechanism for use only at low 
engine speeds which has a relatively short operating 
or opening period or which alternatively deactivates 
the controlled valve. There have already been a number of proposals 
for variable valve timing devices in which means are 
provided for changing the duration of the opening of 
the valve in an internal combustion engine. For example in U.S. Patent No. 4727831 a pair 
of adjacent valves are controlled to operate together 
by means of rocker shafts and cams. The two valves 
are normally driven from the camshaft by two 
low-speed cams (i.e. cams causing the valves to open 
for a short duration) operating on separate rocker 
arms for each valve but a third rocker arm is mounted 
between the two aforesaid rocker arms and is arranged
