<ABSTRACT>
Core-shell ABS copolymers having an SAN shell 
completely surrounding the diene core are provided by melt 

blending an aliphatic diene polymer with an SAN copolymer, 
said copolymer containing functional groups capable of 

reacting with the diene polymer. For example, the SAN 
copolymer may contain azide groups capable of reacting 

with the olefinic groups in the diene polymer, or both the 
SAN copolymer and the diene polymer may contain other 

functional groups capable of interreaction, such as acidic 
(e.g., maleic anhydride) groups in the diene and epoxy (e.g., 

glycidyl methacrylate) groups in the SAN copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
core-shell copolymers, and more particularly to the 
preparation of copolymers of aliphatic dienes, 
alkenylaromatic compounds and ethylenically unsaturated 
nitriles. Various copolymers of aliphatic dienes, 
alkenylaromatic compounds and ethylenically unsaturated 
nitriles are known. The monomers involved are most often 
butadiene, styrene and acrylonitrile, and the polymers 
thereof are generically designated "ABS resins". They are 
most often produced by initially preparing a polybutadiene 
seed latex and copolymerizing styrene and acrylonitrile in 
emulsion in the presence thereof. An intermediate copolymer which may be formed 
in this process, hereinafter designated "high rubber graft", 
is a copolymer at least partially in core-shell form in 
which the principal constituent of the elastomeric core is 
polybutadiene, prepared in emulsion as a latex. A styreneacrylonitrile 
copolymer (hereinafter sometimes "SAN") is 
present partially as occluded domains in the polybutadiene 
and partially as a shell around the polybutadiene particles. A typical high rubber graft comprises about 40-60%, 
typically about 50%, polybutadiene (all percentages 
herein being by weight) and about 40-60% SAN. About 35-45% 
by weight of the SAN, representing about 18-23% of 
total polymer, is chemically bound to the polybutadiene 
latex particles, either as a shell on the surfaces thereof or 
as an internal occluded material; the remainder of the SAN 
is unbound.  It is also conventional to melt blend the high 
rubber graft with additional SAN copolymer to produce a 
blend containing about 15% polybutadiene. Such a blend is 
the principal constituent of many varieties of commercial 
ABS resins, which may also contain other materials such as 
antioxidants. The morphology of ABS resins may be studied by 
transmission electron microscopy. In a typical scanning 
operation, the ungrafted SAN continuous phase is removed 
by dissolution in acetone and the remaining core-shell 
particles are dispersed in a solution of polybutadiene in 
toluene. The toluene is removed by evaporation and the 
residue is molded in a block of epoxy resin. Said block is 
stained with osmium tetroxide and thin sections are 
microtomed and imaged on a transmission electron 
microscope. The polybutadiene particles receive the stain 
and are darkened, while the SAN portion remains light 
colored. It is uniformly observed that a portion of the 
SAN forms occlusions within the polybutadiene particles, 
while the
