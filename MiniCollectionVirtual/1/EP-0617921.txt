<ABSTRACT>
A method for antenatal screening for chromosomal 
abnormalities in a foetus in which the gestational age 

of a pregnant woman is determined characterised in 
that the gestational age is determined (a) by 

reference to the last menstrual period dates and (b) 
by a biometric measurement of the foetus, the 

difference between the ages as determined in (a) and 
(b) is calculated and the calculated difference is 

examined using reference data to determine fetal 
abnormalities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for antenatal
screening for chromosomal abnormalities and to an
apparatus for performing the method.The risk of Down Syndrome and some other
chromosomal abnormalities in a foetus is known to
increase with the age of the mother and it is this
knowledge which forms the basis for selection of
pregnant women for further investigation. Further
investigation in the case of Down Syndrome involves
sampling of the amniotic fluid by amniocentesis, a
procedure which itself carries a risk for the mother
of the foetus, induction of a miscarriage being a
recognised hazard of this procedure.Maternal serum markers for Down Syndrome are
widely used for antenatal screening for this
chromosomal abnormality, the most common of these
markers being alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) - either the intact molecule
thereof or its beta subunit - and unconjugated estriol
(UE). Disclosures relating to the use of these
markers, which may be used in combination with
maternal age, in antenatal screening for Down Syndrome
include US Patent 4,874,693, WO 89/00696 and WO
90/08325. US Patent 5,100,806 discloses the use of the
beta subunit of hCG as a marker in antenatal screening
for Edwards Syndrome.One method of prenatal screening for fetal Down
Syndrome in the second trimester of pregnancy uses a
combination of maternal age and maternal serum (AFP),
(hCG) and (UE). In fetal Down Syndrome the maternal
serum concentrations of (AFP) and (UE) are slightly
lower than in normal pregnancies, when the
concentrations are expressed relative to the median
concentration found in unaffected pregnancies at the 
same age of gestation (termed the multiple of the
median in unaffected pregnancies or MoM). In contrast
the concentration of maternal serum hCG MoM is higher
in Down Syndrome affected pregnancies. The
concentrations of all three markers (as log MoM) are
approximately Gaussian distributed and the
distributions for unaffected and affected pregnancies
overlap. The overlap in values is such that it is
impossible to choose a cut-off point which will
clearly discriminate between the two populations.Knowledge of the concentration of each analyte is
of considerable value, as rather than revealing to
which population the sample value belongs, it reveals
the probability of the sample being taken from a
particular population. The principles involved can be
demonstrated by a graph of frequency against MoM (log
scale) such as Figure 1 which relates to (AFP). This
demonstrates the principles

<CLAIMS>
A method for antenatal screening for
chromosomal abnormalities in a foetus in which the

gestational age of a pregnant woman is determined
characterised in that the gestational age is

determined (a) by reference to the last menstrual
period dates and (b) by a biometric measurement of the

foetus, the difference between the ages as determined
in (a) and (b) is calculated and the calculated

difference is examined using reference data to
determine fetal abnormalities. 
The method according to claim 1, characterised in that
chromosomal abnormalities screened for include

Edwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18), Open Spina Bifida, Down's
Syndrome, Pateaus Syndrome (Trisomy 13), Turner Syndrome,

Monosomy X or Kleinefelter's Syndrome.
The method according to either one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the biometric measurement is

made by ultrasonography.
The method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that maternal age and/or

measurement of a component from maternal fluid are combined
with the gestational age measurements in a multivariate

analysis.
The method according to claim 4, characterised in that
measurement of hCG, either the intact molecule, its alpha

subunit and/or its beta subunit is included.
The method according to claim 5 or claim 6,
characterised in that measurement of at least one marker

selected from the group AFP, PAPPA, UE, In, Pr, 16-alpha-hydroxy-DHEAS
and DHEAS is included. 
The method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that measurements are made in the

period from week 8 to week 22 of pregnancy.
An apparatus adapted to carry out the method of any
one of the preceding claims, comprising means adapted for

receiving measurements relating to a foetus carried by a
pregnant woman and computer means adapted for comparing the

measurements to reference data to determine foetal
abnormalities.
