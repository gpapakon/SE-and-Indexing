<CLAIMS>
Procedure for running a marine diesel engine, where the 
cylinders of the engine are supplied with charge air from an 

exhaust gas turbo charger and where said charge air is conducted 
through a sea-water-cooled charge air cooler,
 
characterized in that
 
the charge air cooler is run with a constant amount of coolant 

throughput,
 
that even during normal operation of the marine diesel engine a 

part of the charge air by-passes the charge air cooler,
 
and that this part of the charge air quantitatively is determined 

in such a manner that downstream of the charge air cooler the 
total charge air has a temperature which is above the daw-point 

and does not exceed the maximum permissible temperature of the 
marine diesel engine and
 
that the part of the charge air which by-passes the charge air 

cooler is jacket cooled. 
Procedure according to claim one, characterized in that the 
charge air temperature is held to a value between 40 and 45Â° Cel.
