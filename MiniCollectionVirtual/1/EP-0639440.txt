<ABSTRACT>
An automotive interior trim component 10 is 
constructed by placing a cover 12 in a closable mold 

18, spraying a coating of urethane foam forming 
materials onto a back surface of the cover 12, closing 

the mold 18 with a lid 20 so that an insert 14 is held 
in spaced relation to the cover 12 and clamping the lid 

20 shut while the foam forming materials react to 
provide a shaped foam cushion 16 that is between and 

bonded to the cover 12 and the insert 14.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of constructing a
molded composite article, and more particularly to a
method of constructing a molded composite article
comprising a shaped foam cushion, such as an automotive
interior trim component.Various methods of constructing molded composite
articles including foam plastics are already known, for
example from JP-A-04018315, FR-A-2545039 and
DE-A-3324038.In JP-A-04018315, a surface sheet which consists of
polyvinyl chloride resin sheet and a cushioning sheet is
vacuum formed. Then a speaker grille is attached to the
molded surface sheet so that its edge is fitted into the
concave of the molded surface sheet. Both the molded
surface sheet and the speaker grille are vacuum formed on
a lower mold of a foaming mold. After glass fibres are put
on the lower mold polyurethane resin is sprayed and is
foamed as plastic foam between the upper and lower molds.
The advantage is stated to be that the door is trim molded
easily with the speaker grille without using a core.FR-A-2545039 discloses various embodiments of flat
composite bodies of polyurethane and fibres, methods for
their preparation, and their utilisation. In a preferred
embodiment of the method of preparation, a flat fibrous
item is deposited in an open molding tool, where it is
sprayed with a polyurethane duromer mixture. Nevertheless,
it is also possible to spray the flat fibrous item outside
the molding tool, and then to deposit the flat fibrous item
impregnated with the polyurethane duromer mixture in the
open molding tool. This operational variant is
advantageously used when, as flat fibrous items, premolded
objects in the form of cloth, woven material or non-woven
glass fabric are used that have, for instance, the shape of
half-molds for suitcases or coolers or cylindrical half-molds
for pipes. The flat fibrous item and the expandable
duromer polyurethane mixture are introduced into the
molding tool in such quantities that the expansion in the 
closed molding tool preferably takes place under
compression and that a compression rate of 1.2 to 10, and
more specifically between 1.5 and 4, is established.
Molding and complete curing are done at molding tool
temperatures of 50 to 120°C, preferably from 60 to 100°C,
and more specifically from 80 to 100°C.If desired, it is possible simultaneously to cover the
flat composite polyurethane and fiber bodies in the molding
tools during molding and curing on one side or both sides
by a separation sheet or a decorative matter, preferably a
metal sheet or a metallic foil

<CLAIMS>
A method of constructing a molded composite article
(10) comprised of a foam backing (16) and a cover (12)

attached together, comprising the steps of:

providing a mold (18) that has a closable mold cavity,
providing a removable cover(12) having a face
extending over a surface of the mold cavity and an exposed

back,
spraying a coating of urethane foam forming materials
over substantially the whole of the back of the cover (12)

while the cover (12) extends over said surface of the mold
cavity, and
closing said cavity and bringing a substrate (14)into
a desired space relationship to the cover (12),the urethane

foam forming materials reacting to fill a space between
the substrate (14) and the back of the cover (12) with a

foam to provide a foam backing (16)attaching the substrate
(14) to the cover (12).
A method according to claim 1, wherein said
closing of said cavity comprises closing said cavity

with a mold lid (20) which carries said substrate (14)and
the closing of which brings said substrate (14)into said

relationship to the cover (12).
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
substrate (14) is a structural member.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
cover (12) is provided in the form of a premolded

thermoplastic shell (12) of polyvinyl chloride.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said foam backing (16) comprises a semi-rigid

polyurethane foam.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the
foam forming materials are an isocyanate and a polyol that

are sprayed onto the back of the cover (12).
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said coating is sprayed in a substantially uniform manner

over substantially the whole of the back of the cover (12).
