<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the aim of the method is to counter difficulties in the measurement of the temporally fluctuating measuring signal for the water flow by employing suitable control of the turbine to deliberately preset the magnitude of the water current flowing through the turbines in such a way that during measurement this magnitude can be comeasured only for monitoring purposes. Measuring points can be compared with one another for the purpose of evaluation precisely when the quantity of water thus controlled proves to be constant from measuring point to measuring point within certain tolerances. If the adjustment of moving (rotating) blades and distributor (guide apparatus) is performed simultaneously at a mutual ratio precisely such that there is no throttling or increase in the current of water processed by the water turbine, the power leaving the generator is directly proportional to the efficiency of the turbine at the respective measuring point and representative for determining the best efficiency.

Method for optimizing the degree of efficiency of a 
water turbine comprising a guide apparatus with 

adjustable guide blades and a rotor wheel which is 
coupled to an electrical generator and which has 

adjustable rotor blades, in order, in operation of the 
water turbine with a given height of fall (H), to set a 

suitable water flow (Q) by the guide blades and the 
rotor blades, wherein, 


in a first step, starting from an operating point (A1) 
of an H
1
=constant line which corresponds to a particular 
water flow (Q
1
) due to the association of the position 
of the rotor blades and guide blades, a starting point 

(B1) for the same height of fall (H1) and for an 
approximately constant water flow (Q
1
) is approached by 
simultaneously effecting a reduction of the guide blade 

position and an enlargement of the rotor blade position 
on a line of action (3) transverse to the H
1
=constant 
line, with the enlargement of the rotor blade position 

amounting, in adjustment percentages of the adjustment 
range, to 1 to 0.7 times the adjustment percentages of 

the guide blades, until a reduction of up to 10% of the 
adjustment range of the guide blades is achieved in 

order to measure and to store the power (P) taken up 
there by the generator after a dwell time; 
wherein, in a second step and in further subsequent 
steps, the line of action (3) is traversed in the 

opposite direction, with the power (P) delivered at the 
generator being measured and stored after each joint 

adjustment step of the guide wheel and of the rotor 
wheel of approximately 3% of the adjustment range and 

after a dwell time of approximately 3 minutes, until an  
 

enlargement of up to 10% of the adjustment range of the 
guide blades is achieved beyond the original operating 

point (A1) ; 
wherein, in an evaluation step, the powers measured 
are compared in order determine the particular 

combination of guide blade position and rotor blade 
position for which the largest power (P) was delivered 

at the generator, and in order to associate this 
combination as an optimized point (A1') to a new H
1
'= 
constant line having an improved degree of efficiency; 
wherein, in a later step, the new combination of the 
blade positions from the optimized point (A
1
') is used 
as a predetermined control value for the simultaneous 

adjustment of the guide blades and of the rotor blades 
for the regulation along an improved H
1
'=constant line. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterised in 
that, for the height of fall (H
1
), further optimized 
operating points (A
k
',A
n
') corresponding to other water 
flows (Q) and associated guide blade and rotor blade 

positions are determined and stored on reaching further 
provisional operating points (A
k
,A
n
), in order to form 
supporting points for an optimized H
1
'=constant line. 
Process in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that a plurality of supporting values with optimized 

operating points (A') are determined and stored for a 
plurality of heights of fall (H) in order to form a 

network of supporting values for an optimized 
interpolation of H=constant lines lying therebetween. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the carrying out of the  

 
optimization takes place supported by a computer in 

accordance with a program and fully automatically by, on 
the one hand, making available as measurement values to 

a computer; the height of fall (H) of a relevant 
H=constant line, the current guide blade and rotor blade 

positions and the instantaneous power (P) delivered by 
the generator and cos  and, on the other hand, by the 

computer prescribing for the first step, as well as for 
the second step and further subsequent steps the 

adjustment speed and the adjustment scheme for the guide 
blades and the rotor blades and also the dwell times, 

and making available the optimum combination at the 
point (A
1
') determined in the evaluation step as a new 
predetermined value for the control of the turbine along 

an improved H'=constant line. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that measurement values for the water 

flow, for instance in the form of spiral pressure 
measurement signals, are determined periodically and 

made available to a computer so that these measurement 
values are used, in parallel with a water flow 

determined theoretically by a point (A
1
), for checking 
the degree of efficiency and as supporting values for 

lines with the same water flow. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the measurement signal for the 

generator power is subjected to low-pass filtering by 
not letting through either signals greater than or the 

same as the prevailing mains frequency, for instance 50 
or 60Hz, or signals of a frequency greater than the 

product of shaft rotation frequency and blade number.  
 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the power (P) taken up by the 

generator is obtained from the measurement signal for 

the actual power and is corrected by the computational 
inclusion of a blind power signal in order to compensate 

the degree of efficiency of the generator which is 
dependent on the blind power. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the first step takes place in a 

direction opposite to and away from a point (A
1
) in that 
a simultaneous enlargement of the guide blade position 

and reduction of the rotor blade position takes place, 
whereas the second step and the subsequent steps on the 

same line of action (3) lead to values with a smaller 
guide blade position and with a larger rotor blade 

position. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 4 to 8, 
characterised in that an event-controlled 

self-optimization of operating points (A') is undertaken 
with the computer by setting this self-optimization in 

operation at predetermined times when particular 
measurement values are reached, for instance at heights 

of fall (H) with particular combinations of guide blade 
and rotor blade positions, for non-plausible 

combinations of parameters, or for particular 
constellations of the inflow. 
Process in accordance with one of the claims 4 to 8,

approximately +/- 10% of the guide blade adjustment is 
traversed in both directions on the line of action (3) 

in less than 5 minutes and the signal for the generator 
power which has been subjected to extreme low-pass

having reached the largest guide blade position at a 
point A*, have a rotor position ϕ* with a reserve with 

respect to the largest rotor position ϕ 100%, the 
process is continued for values beyond A* in such a 

manner that, with the largest guide wheel position, the 
rotor position is increased stepwise and the associated 

power delivered at the generator is determined and 
stored in order to determine for later limitations the 

position for the power which is the maximum deliverable 
for this height of fall. 
Process for the optimization of the degree of efficiency 
of a water turbine in accordance with one of the claims 

1 to 11, characterized in that a computer is used for 
the optimization and simultaneously controls the 

operation of the water turbine.
