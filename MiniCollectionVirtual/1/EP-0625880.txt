<ABSTRACT>
A latching mechanism (2) can be used to attach a child's seat to various supports to make a high chair, stroller, bicycle with child seat, etc. The mechanism is attached to the seat frame with the elongate element (30) connected to the seat back and the balance of the device shown connected under the seat proper. The pins (8a, b) are biased (by action of spring 14) into holes of a respective support so as to join the seat thereto. The pins are disengaged by linear motion of rod (16) which is converted to simultaneous linear movements of rods (18) due to notches on the rods engaging with the teeth of twin gears (24a, b). The sprung catch (28) can prevent movement of rod (16), and thus prevent removal of the seat, in that the apertured plate (32) hinders movement of tab (42) of rod (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a releasable locking mechanism, and
in particular, but not exclusively, to a releasable locking mechanism for
incorporating into a child's chair to allow demountable connection of the chair
to a plurality of different supports.There has always been a need to adapt various articles so that they
can be safely and demountably connected to corresponding supports. One
example of this is in the area relating to children's furniture where articles
such as chairs and bassinettes are adapted for demountable connection with
stands and other supports. Often the devices used to allow demountable
connection such as straps, clips, screws and bolts are difficult or inconvenient
to use or require the use of hand tools to operate.Examples of locking mechanisms are to be found for instance in US-A-2431105,
WO-A-88/07616, FR-A-2629508 and US-A-3910611. All of these
are intended for use as door locks, and not for connecting one component to
another in such a way as the one component is connected to the other
component solely by the mechanism, and can be selectively disconnected for
complete removal from the other component.It is an object of the present invention to provide a releasable locking
mechanism for demountably connecting an article to a support which is both
easy and convenient to use.A releasable locking mechanism to demountably connect an article
with a support, which mechanism comprises at least one engaging means to
releasably connect said article and said support, said at least one engaging
means being movable between a first position in which the article is
connected with said support and a second position in which the article is
disconnected from said support thereby enabling removal of said article
therefrom; characterised in that said mechanism further comprises:
retracting means to retract said engaging means from said first
position to said second position;biasing means to bias said engaging means toward said first position;
and coupling means for coupling said retracting means to said engaging
means such that movement of said retracting means causes said engaging
means to move between said first and second positions wherein said
coupling means comprises a rotatable gear and wherein said engaging
means and said retracting means are maintained in meshing contact with said
gear.Preferably said engaging means is retained in said locking mechanism
for sliding movement between said first and second positions.Preferably said retracting means for retracting said engaging

<CLAIMS>
A releasable locking mechanism (2) to demountably connect an article
with a support (4), which mechanism (2) comprises at lea
st one engaging
means (6) to releasably connect said article and said support (4), said at

least one engaging means (6) being movable between a first position in
which the article is connected with said support (4) and a second position in

which the article is disconnected from said support (4) thereby enabling
removal of said article therefrom; characterised in that said mechanism further comprises:


retracting means (16) to retract said engaging means (6) from said first
position to said second position;
biasing means (14) to bias said engaging means (6) toward said first
position; and
coupling means for coupling said retracting means (16) to said
engaging means (6) such that movement of said retracting means (16)

causes said engaging means (6) to move between said first and second
positions wherein said coupling means comprises a rotatable gear (24a) and

wherein said engaging means (6) and said retracting means (16) are
maintained in meshing contact with said gear.
A releasable locking mechanism (2) as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that a plurality of engaging means (6) are provided to

connect said article with said support at a plurality of locations.
A releasable locking mechanism (2) as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that said engaging means (6) is retained in said locking

mechanism (2) for sliding movement between said first and second positions.
A releasable locking mechanism (2) as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that said retracting means (16) for retracting said

engaging means (6) moves in a direction substantially perpendicular to the
direction of movement of said engaging means (6).
A releasable locking mechanism (2) as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that said biasing means (14) is connected with said

retracting means (16) such as to urge said engaging means (6) to move
toward said first position. 
A releasable locking mechanism (2) as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that said engaging means (6) comprises at least two

arms and said coupling means further comprises a second gear (24b),
wherein separate ones of said arms are in meshing contact with respective

ones of said gears (24a,24b) and said retracting means (16) meshes with
both of said gears whereby said retracting means (16) can be manipulated to

cause rotation of said gears (24a,24b) and thereby slidably move both of said
arms (10a,10b) between said first and second positions.
A releasable locking mechanism (2) as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, further comprising a catch movable between a first state in which said

engaging means (6) is prevented from moving from said first position to said
second position, and a second state in which said engaging means (6) is

allowed to move from said first position to said second position.
A releasable locking mechanism (2) to demountably connect an article
with a support (4), which mechanism comprises


at least one engaging means (6) to releasably connect said article and
said support (4), said at least one engaging means (6) being movable

between a first position in which the article is connection with said support (4)
and a second position in which the article is disconnected with said support

(4) and a second position in which the article is disconnected from said
support (4) thereby enabling removal of said article therefrom;

characterised in that said mechanism further comprises:

retracting means (16) to retract said engaging means (6) from said first
position to said second position;
biasing means (14) to bias said engaging means (6) towards said first
