<ABSTRACT>
A method of encapsulating an optical component, 
the component comprising at least partially uncoated 

organic material, the method comprising placing molten 
metal around the optical component, and solidifying the 

metal. The invention includes encapsulating a segment or 
element of an optical component, such as, for example, an 

optical junction, a surface, an optical fiber coupler, 
or a splice. An encapsulated optical 

component and optical components having sealed or 
encapsulated elements are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of 
encapsulating optical components and products produced by 
those methods. Optical components are exposed to a wide variety of 
detrimental environmental influences during use. 
Environmental influences may cause physical, chemical or 
optic damage to an optical component. For example, one 
kind of planar optical fiber coupler is comprised of 
optical fibers that are precision aligned and fastened via 
adhesive, typically light-curable acrylic, to a glass 
coupler substrate. The adhesive can absorb moisture from 
the atmosphere and change dimensions and rigidity, thereby 
lowering the precision alignment and increasing signal 
loss. Such environmental influences must be minimized to 
ensure optimal component life and performance. Several means of protecting optical components have 
been proposed, e.g. U.S. Patent 5,091,989. U.S. Patents 
4,707,069 and 4,714,316 are directed to protective 
arrangements for optical fiber units or couplers. They are 
still susceptible to moisture and chemicals. The method of 
Japanese patent application 60-10707 for making a fused 
optical fiber coupler, is cumbersome to perform since much 
of it must be carried out in an anhydrous atmosphere and 
since it requires sputtering or vapor deposition equipment,  
 
teaching that the molten metal may not be applied directly 
to the organic material of the coupler, but over the 
primary metal layer which has been applied by sputtering or 
vacuum vapor deposition. Furthermore, this method is only 
taught for fused optical fiber couplers, not other couplers 
or optical components. Therefore, a need exists for a method of protecting 
optical components that minimizes moisture adsorption and 
chemical degradation, provides structural protection and 
which is relatively cheap, fast and easy to perform. The present invention solves previously encountered 
problems in protecting optical components from the 
environment. The present inventors discovered that molten 
metal may be placed in direct contact with the organic 
material of an optical component under normal atmospheric 
conditions without significantly affecting the optical 
functioning of the component. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a 
method of encapsulating an optical component, the component 
comprising at least partially uncoated organic material, 
the method comprising: placing molten metal around the 
optical component, and solidifying the metal. It will be 
appreciated that encapsulating an optical component
