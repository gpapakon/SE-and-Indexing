<DESCRIPTION>
 Packaging container and method of producing the sameField of the inventionThe invention relates to a packaging container and method of producing a packaging container comprising at least one inner layer and one outer layer, wherein said inner and outer layers are held together by mechanical anchoring means, said mechanical anchoring means comprising at least one portion formed on one of said layers. Such a container is known from SE 350 943 or SE 353 876 for example.Background to the inventionContainers of the above mentioned type are often formed as an inner plastics tray and an outer cardboard tray and are foreseen with a flange at the upper edge of the inner tray to which a reclosable lid can be fitted. A typical application for such a container is as a container for margarine or dairy products such as cheese spreads for example.However, these containers have the disadvantage that the various handling procedures carried out on them such as ejection from the mould, filling, closing and further operations, require that the inner and outer layers need to be securely held together to prevent separation e.g. due to flexing. The solution normally adopted is to heat seal the layers together, often with the addition of a hot melt adhesive. 

Due to the increased concern for the environment, it is desirable to make containers which are readily recyclable. Containers of the above type are however unsuitable since the material of the outer layer (normally fibrous) cannot easily be separated from the plastics inner layer.Clearly a need exists for a container which has an inner layer readily suitable for product storage, which can easily be combined with an outer layer which is strong, on which one can easily print and which allows separation for recycling but which still ensures secure attachment for processing purposes. In particular it is preferred that the inner layer has very little stiffness and that the required stiffness is provided by the outer layer.As a solution to these problems a container has been proposed in our Swedish application SE 9100905-0, not prior published, wherein an inner plastics layer is secured to an outer cardboard stiffening layer by means of rivet type projections formed on the inner member which project through and are of slightly larger dimension than the cut- outs provided in the outer cardboard layer. In one embodiment the rivet-like projections are assisted at each of the corners by a larger projection which has a lower edge overlapping an upper edge portion of the outer

Claims
1. A packaging container comprising at least one inner layer (2) and one outer layer (1) , wherein said inner and outer layers are held together by mechanical anchoring means (4,5,6), said mechanical anchoring means (4,5,6) comprising at least one portion formed on one of said layers (2), characterized in that said portion is substantially dovetail-shaped and in that at least one side of the dovetail-shaped portion overlaps at least a portion of the other (1) of said layers.
2. A packaging container according to claim 1, characterized in that said at least one side is a sloping side of a dovetail-shaped portion.
3. A packaging container according to either of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the inner layer (2) comprises a thermoformable material and the outer layer (1) comprises a non-thermoformable material, preferably cardboard, said at least one dovetail-shaped portion (4,5,6) being formed on said inner layer (2) .
4. A packaging container according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said dovetail-shaped portion formed on one of said layers has two sloping sides each of which overlaps the other layer.
5. A packaging container according to any preceding claim, characterized in that there are a plurality of said dovetail-shaped portions formed on the inner layer, positioned at the corners and/or on the side and/or ends of said packaging container. 


6. A packaging container according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the outer layer (1) is foreseen with shaped cut-outs (4' ' ,5' ' ,6' ') which are slightly smaller than the dovetail-shaped portions (4,5,6) on the inner layer (2) .
7. A packaging container according to any preceding claim, characterized in that the lower edge portion (4') of the dovetail-shaped portion (4) formed on said one layer (2) overlaps part of said other layer (1) .
8. A packaging container according to claim 6, characterized in that the cut-outs are positioned along the upper edge (9) of the outer layer (1) .
9. A packaging container according to any preceding claim, characterized in that the outer layer (1) is formed from a folded and erected cardboard blank, the blank having a base (a) , side panels (b) and two end panels (c) , the said end panels (c) each being a single layer flap folded about the base (a) over the respective ends (7) of the side panels (b) and anchored in position only by said dovetail-shaped portion (5) on the inner layer (2) .
10. A packaging container according to any preceding claim, characterized in that the base edge of the shaped portion extends outwardly from the surface of the container on which it is formed by a sufficient amount in order to provide a ledge to assist de-stacking of a stack of containers.
11. A packaging container according to any preceding claim, characterized in that some or all of the dovetail- shaped portions are provided with two principal surfaces of differing slope, said principal surfaces intersecting along a line (5') . 


 12. A method of producing a packaging container wherein a blank of a foldable material, preferably cardboard, having preferably dovetail-shaped cut-outs therein is introduced into a female mould and wherein the
- 5 female mould has correspondingly shaped recesses which substantially align with said cut-outs in the folded and erected blank, and wherein a plastics material is introduced inside the erected blank, said plastics material thereby covering at least the whole of the inside of the
10 blank and entering into the recesses in the mould, and wherein the outer layer is anchored to the inner layer by at least one of the sides of the dovetail-shaped portions formed on the inner layer.
13. A method according to claim 12, wherein the 15 plastics material is introduced into the erected blank and recesses by pressure and/or vacuum-forming a plastics sheet which has been preheated.
14. A method according to either of claims 13 or 14, wherein the blank is brought to the female mould in a flat
20 condition and is folded and erected by being introduced into said female mould.
