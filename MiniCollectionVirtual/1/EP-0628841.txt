<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a new 
and useful polymeric optical fiber splicer-connector 
useful for connecting two optical fibers together. 
More specifically, the invention relates to a 
connectorized optical fiber splicer-connector. Many modern telecommunications networks have been 
converted from older, metallic wire transmission lines, 
and accompanying technology, into newer, optical fiber 
transmission lines and technology. By performing this 
conversion, the telecommunications networks are able to 
provide better service to their subscribers. Specifically, optical fiber telecommunications 
networks offer faster transmission speed and greater 
information density than the metallic wire networks. 
Also, the optical fiber networks have greater utility 
in employments with digital technology, as opposed to 
the metallic wire networks, which are more suited to 
use with analog technology. This is particularly  
 
important with the advent of computers networked by means of a 
telecommunications network, as well as the now common usage of 
facsimile machines. While the conversion from metallic wire to optical 
fiber technology affords subscribers great benefits, the 
conversion is often troublesome for the network operators. While 
the equipment itself may be converted or replaced, the optical 
fiber equipment must occupy the same physical space as or less 
space than that occupied by the metallic wire equipment. Because 
the areas surrounding the equipment of the telecommunications 
network is limited, the optical fibers, and their accompanying 
equipment, which may require a space larger than the available 
space, will not fit into the existing space. For instance, in order to connect optical fibers to a 
piece of telecommunications equipment, a splicer is first used 
to connect one optical fiber to another. Additionally, the 
spliced optical fiber must then be joined to the equipment 
through a connector. The splicer and the connector occupy a 
substantial amount of space, which is at a premium in a 
telecommunications network. Additionally, because essentially 
two separate connections must be made, the installation procedure 
can be tedious and complicated. These problems lead to additional costs in 
reconfiguring the space as needed to house the splicer and the 
connector, as well as increased installation costs. the 
telecommunications network operator may or may not be able to 
pass these costs on to the subscribers. The polymeric splicer 
and connector, constructed according to
