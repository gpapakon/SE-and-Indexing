<ABSTRACT>
A biodegradable interpolymer and composition is prepared by the reactive blending of a synthetic polymer having functional groups with a naturally occurring biodegradable polymer such as a carbohydrate or protein compound. During reactive blending, the synthetic polymer can undergo a chemical reaction with the biodegradable natural polymer which results in covalent and physical bonding between the two polymers, thereby forming an interpolymer. By this process, a biodegradable interpolymer composition is produced that is suitable for molding various articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to biodegradable
polymers. More particularly, the invention relates to
biodegradable interpolymers and compositions made
therefrom produced by reactive blending of synthetic and
naturally occurring polymers. The synthetic polymers
have functional groups thereon, and the natural polymers
can include various biodegradable polymers such as
carbohydrates or natural materials comprising starch and proteins.Synthetic polymers are increasingly replacing
conventional materials like metal, wood, glass and paper
because of their excellent mechanical properties, as
well as chemical and weather resistance. However, these
very properties make such polymers nonbiodegradable, and
as a result, a large amount of plastic waste is
accumulating in landfills, causing severe pollution.
The burden of accumulating plastic waste has led to a
growing interest in the development of biodegradable
plastics. The environmental movement in advanced
countries generally supports the idea that plastics used
in packaging and other discardable containers should be
biodegradable. For many biomedical, agricultural, and
ecological uses, it is preferable to have a
biodegradable polymer that will undergo degradation in
the physiological environment or by microbial action in
the soil.Although the use of petroleum-based plastics
continues to grow, limited oil reserves and the effect 
of plastics on the environment has generated a need for
degradable plastics based on renewable sources like
cereal grains or cellulose, since most synthetic
plastics are resistant to microbiological attack. Many
plastic articles contain biopolymers including starch or
cellulose based additives such as fillers, extenders and
reinforcing agents. However, the amount of biopolymer
currently being used in plastics is relatively small and
would account for a minor fraction of a percent of the
total plastics produced.Most synthetic (petroleum-based) polymers and
natural polymers such as polysaccharides and proteins
are immiscible at the molecular level. Prior
researchers have used graft copolymers of starch and
vinyl monomers to develop biodegradable blends. In this
type of reaction, the vinyl monomer is grafted onto the
starch backbone. The most common method of grafting is
the free radical initiation technique, including
initiation by chemical methods and initiation by
irradiation. The addition of block copolymers as a
compatibilizer has also been utilized, however, block
copolymers in general are expensive and those from
polysaccharides
