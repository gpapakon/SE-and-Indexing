<ABSTRACT>
An article which includes at least one layer 
of a network of high strength fibers, preferably 

extended chain polyethylene fibers. The fibers of the 
network are coated with a very low modulus elastomeric 

matrix material, preferably an acrylic ester copolymer, 
which has a tensile modulus of less than about 100 psi, 

a tenacity of less than 450 psi (3105 kPa), a glass 
transition temperature (T
g
) of about -10°C to about - 
20°C, and an elongation-to-break of at least about 

2000%. The article can further include a second matrix 
material, preferably made of polyethylene, adjacent to 

the fiber network layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible
ballistic resistant composite article which includes a
network of high strength fibers coated or impregnated
with an elastomeric matrix material.Various constructions are known for
ballistic resistant articles such as vests, curtains,
mats, raincoats and umbrellas. These articles display
varying degrees of resistance to penetration by high
speed impact from projectiles such as BB's, bullets,
shells, shrapnel, glass fragments and the like. U.S.
Patents No. 4,820,568; 4,748,064; 4,737,402; 4,737,401;
4,681,792; 4,650,710; 4,623,574; 4,613,535; 4,584,347;
4,563,392; 4,543,286; 4,501,856; 4,457,985; and
4,403,012 describe ballistic resistant articles which
include high strength fibers made from materials such
as extended chain ultra-high molecular weight
polyethylene. Typically these fibers are coated,
embedded or impregnated with a resin matrix. Of
particular interest among the above disclosures is the
description of the materials that can be used for the
resin matrix that is found, for example, at column 6,
line 44 to column 7, line 11, of U.S. Patent No.
4,820,568; column 5, lines 40-56 of U.S. Patent No.
4,623,574; and column 4, lines 40-59 of U.S. Patent No.
4,650,710. In addition to these patents, commonly
assigned copending U.S. Patent No. 5,175,040 describes
a flexible multi-layered impact resistant article
wherein the flexibility is a result of the manner in
which the successive layers are adhered to each other.Although the ballistic resistant articles
described in the above documents provide sufficient
protection against most threats, a need exists for
further improvement in ballistic resistance and
improved flexibility for the articles. The above-mentioned US-A-4737401 (preamble of claim 1) describes flexible ballistic resistant fabric
armour comprising a network of high strength fibers coated with a low
modulus elastomeric material. The fibers are extended chain polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyvinyl alcohol or polyacrylonitrile fibers of not more than
55.56 tex (500 denier) and having a tensile modulus of at least 176.6 dN/tex
(g/denier). The low modulus elastomeric material coating the fibers has a
tensile modulus of less than 41370.0 kPa (6000 psi), most preferably less
than 3447.5 kPa (500 psi).WO-92/10363 describes a fire-resistant ballistic composite having a fire-retardant
layer on a layer comprising a network of high strength polyethylene
or aramid fibers in a matrix of thermoplastic and/or thermosetting resin.The present invention provides an
