<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser gun for selectively dispensing controlled 
quantities of viscous or semi-viscous materials, and in 

particular liquid pesticides or insecticides, employs a 
vacuum driven operating system for discharging and reloading 

the viscous or semi-viscous materials to be discharged. The 
dispenser gun is designed to create pressure differentials 

in adjoining chambers which, in conjunction with a 
cooperating valve system, enables the discharge of precisely 

metered quantities of material and prevents continued and 
undesired discharge or dripping from a discharge nozzle 

after a preselected quantity of material has been discharged 
from the dispenser gun. The handle of the device includes 

structure for pre-selecting one or more predetermined 
quanitites of material to be discharged from the dispenser 

in repeatable sequences. The dispenser gun also includes 
structure for removably receiving a replaceable reservoir of 

viscous or semi-viscous material to be discharged from the 
gun.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to dispensing devices
for discharging predetermined quantities of viscous or
semi-viscous materials from the nozzle of a gun-like device
having a manually actuated trigger structure for selectively
discharging the materials from the gun. In particular, the
discharge device of the present invention is primarily
adapted for the application of relatively small quantities
of viscous or semi-viscous liquid insecticides or pesticides
to be applied to relatively small target areas in accurate
and repeatable sequences.US-A-1 936 526 discloses a device as defined by the preamble of
claim 1.The following United States patents represent typical
prior art dispensing devices for discharging liquid
materials, including viscous or semi-viscous materials: U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,141,583; 3,517,638; 3,545,680; 4,062,480;
4,083,474; 4,394,945; 4,531,912; 4,678,107; 4,809,885;
4,821,927; 4,923,096; 4,991,747; 5,022,563; 5,064,098;
5,065,910; and 5,137,187.It is an object of the present invention to overcome
disadvantages of the known prior art dispensing guns. In
particular, the discharge devices encompassed within the
scope of the present invention provide manually actuated
dispensing guns including means for presetting selected 
quantities of material to be discharged from the device, and
assuring that the precisely metered quantity of discharged
material are applied in repeatable sequences at the
selection of the user. The dispensing gun is adapted to
operate as a vacuum driven system, and includes suction
generating means for evacuating a discharge chamber to
prevent dripping of material from the gun after the desired
quantity of material has been discharged. The dispensing gun
is particularly adapted to the discharge and application of
viscous and semi-viscous materials, and in particular,
liquid pesticides and insecticides, which, by the nature of
the products, precisely measured, relatively small
quantities of material are discharged and applied to well
defined and closely confined target locations. It is the
further object of the present invention to provide a
dispensing device including means for adjusting one or more
of the preset quantities of material dischargeable from the
gun, and further providing means for readily enabling the
user to discharge the same predetermined quantities of
material from the gun in easily repeatable selected
sequences.Other objects and advantages of the present invention
will become apparent from the following discussion in
conjunction with the

<CLAIMS>
A device for discharging a liquid material including a housing (1A), a handle
(25A), a trigger (19) and means (18) for coupling said trigger (19) to a movable

piston (6) in said housing (1A) for selectively advancing and retracting the relative
position of said piston (6) in said housing; said housing defining a discharge

chamber (32), and said piston (6) being selectively movable into and out of said
discharge chamber (32) in response to actuation of said trigger (19); said piston

(6) defining a central bore therein for providing fluid communication between a
product reservoir (2) disposed rearwardly of said piston (6) and said discharge

chamber (32) defined forwardly of said piston (6); valve means (9) disposed on the
end of said bore in said piston (6) adjacent to said discharge chamber (32); said

discharge chamber defining outlet means (14-16) in the forward end therof;
wherein forward movement of said piston (6) into said discharge chamber (32)

increases the pressure within said chamber (32) to discharge material therein
through said outlet means (14-16), and retraction of said piston (6) in a direction

rearwardly relative to said discharge chamber (32) decreases the pressure within
said chamber to result in flow of material in a forward direction through said bore

in said piston (6) from said rearwardly disposed product reservoir (2) and into said
forwardly disposed discharge chamber (32), and retraction of said piston (6)

simultaneously results in rearward flow of material positioned forward of said
discharge chamber through said outlet means (14.16) for avoiding undesirable

accumulation of non-discharged residual material in the discharge nozzle and
the resulting continuous discharge of dripping material after the piston (6) has

completed its forward discharge stroke and for reloading said discharge
chamber (32) for subsequent discharge of material therefrom, characterized in that

the device further includes a means (10) in said discharge chamber (32) for
exerting a resilient force on said valve means (9) for sealing said forward end of

said bore in said piston (6) when said piston is advanced in a forward direction 
into said discharge chamber (32).
The device as claimed in claim 1 further including a discharge needle (16)
extending from the forward end of said device and in fluid communication with the

outlet means (13-15) defined in the forward end of said discharge chamber (32) for
discharging material from said device through said discharge needle (16).

receiving said product reservoir (2) in said housing (1A) for replacing said product

reservoir (2) when the material therein is depleted; and further including an end
cap (1) pivotally mounted to the rear of said housing, said end cap (1) being

pivotal between an opened and a closed position for removing and receiving said
product reservoir (2) in said housing (1A).
A dispensing device for a viscous or semi-viscous material including a housing
(1A), a handle (25A) and a trigger (19) movable relative to said handle (25A)

wherein actuation of said trigger (19) results in discharge of said semi-viscous or
viscous material from said housing (1A) said housing (1A) defining a discharge

chamber (32) therein, and a reciprocating piston (6) movable relative to said
discharge chamber (32) for varying the pressure therein in response to actuation

of said trigger (19); said discharge chamber (32) including a forward end (48)
defining at least one outlet port (50,52), characterized in that said discharge

chamber (32) including a displaceable flap (13) mounted to said forward end (48)
of said discharge chamber (32) for selectively covering said at least one outlet port

(50,52) defined therein ; said flap (13) being displaced in response to increased
pressure in said discharge chamber (32) for permitting flow of material out from

said discharge chamber (32) through said at least one outlet port (50,52) in a
forwardly direction, and said flap (13) being displaced in response to decreased

pressure within said discharge chamber (32) for permitting flow of material 
rearwardly into said discharge chamber (32) through said at least one outlet port

(50,52) for preventing the accumulation of residual material forward of said
discharge chamber (32).

product reservoir (2) disposed rearwardly of said piston (6) and said discharge
chamber (32) defined forwardly of said piston (6), wherein reduced pressure in

said discharge chamber (32) as a result of rearward relative movement of said
piston (6) causes flow of material from said product reservoir through said bore in

said piston (6) and into said discharge chamber (32).
The device as claimed in claim 5 further including valve means (9) disposed on
the end of said bore in said piston (6) adjacent to said discharge chamber (32) for

controlling the flow of material through said bore in response to pressure variations
within said discharge chamber (32); and further including means (10) for applying

a resilient force on said valve means (9) for sealing said forward end of said bore
