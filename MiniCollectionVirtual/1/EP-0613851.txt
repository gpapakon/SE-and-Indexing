<ABSTRACT>
A braking device for an elevator, wherein a cage 
(3) moves along a guide rail. The braking device includes a 

wedge braking device (10) a speed governor (20) and a 
linking mechanism. The wedge braking device (10) has wedges 

(14) which are pressed against the guide rail (2) thereby 
stopping the cage (3) when the speed governor (20) senses an 

excess speed or when a weight responsive mechanism senses a 
fall in weight. The wedge braking device (10) has an 

hydraulic release mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elevator braking device
provided with the function of preventing the cage
free falling in the event of a malfunction.In recent years types of self running elevator
have been proposed wherein the cage runs freely within the
ascending/descending path under a drive provided by a linear
motor instead of the traction-type elevator wherein the cage
is raised and lowered by a winch drive using a conventional
suspension rope.Hereinafter the non-winch type elevator is known as
a self propelled elevator. A self propelled elevator has a
construction, as shown for example in JP-A-02261789,
wherein a primary coil and secondary
conductor of a linear motor are provided facing each other
with a small gap between them on the left and right side
faces of the cage and on left and right inside wall faces of
the ascending/descending path, whereby the cage runs along
guide rails within the ascending/descending path under a
propulsive force generated between the primary coil and
secondary conductor of the linear motor.Self propelled elevators have various advantages as
described below. Since a winch is not employed there is no
restriction on the length of the ascent/descent. Its
transportation capabilities can be improved by having more 
than one cage run along a single elevator path. The need to
provide a machinery room directly above the
ascending/descending path is eliminated.In the self propelled elevators of this type
provided with no suspension rope, the linear motor generates
a propulsive force so as to raise, lower or stop the cage.
There is a risk that the cage could fall in the event of a
malfunction. For this reason, safety measures to prevent
the cage falling are essential.A braking device is disclosed in JP-A-02261789,
and comprises a pair of left
and right levers having brake shoes at their ends that are
free to open and close to clamp the guide rails.
Compression coil springs bias the left and right levers such
that the brake shoes at their ends press against the guide
rails. Solenoids and links act to open the left and right
levers against these compression coil springs. During
running of the cage, the solenoids are excited by an applied
voltage so that the left and right levers are opened thereby
releasing the brake. In braking, voltage to the solenoids
is cut off, causing the left and right levers to be closed
by the spring force so that the brake shoes are pressed
against the guide rails and braking of the cage is effected.Since the self propelled elevator braking device

<CLAIMS>
An elevator braking device, wherein a cage (3)
moves along a guide rail (2), comprising:


a wedge braking means (10) mounted on said cage
(3);
a speed governor means (20); and
a linking means for linking said wedge braking
means (10) and said speed governor means (20);
said wedge braking means (10) including,
a resilient support member (12),
a wedge guide means (13), supported by said
resilient support member (12),
a wedge member (14), provided between said guide
rail (2) and said wedge guide means (13), to be pressed

against said guide rail (2) by a biasing force generated by
said resilient support member (12), thereby stopping said

cage (3) by means of a first frictional force between said
guide rail (2) and said wedge member (14),
a releasing means for releasing said resilient
support member (12) such that said wedge member (14)

separates from said guide rail (2) when a releasing force is
generated; and
said linking means being linked such that the speed
governor (20) pulls up said wedge members (14) along said

wedge guide means (13) when said speed governor means (20)
detects that a speed of said cage exceeds a rated speed, 

thereby pressing said wedge member (14) against said guide
rail (2) and effecting an emergency stop of said cage (3) by

means of a second frictional force between said guide rail
and said wedge member (14), wherein:
said wedge braking means (10) includes,
a balancing spring means (40) provided under said
wedge member (14) for supporting said wedge member (14), a

spring force thereof being set such that said spring force
balances the weight of said wedge member (14) so that said

wedge member (14) is supported in a positiion with a
suitable clearance with respect to said guide rail (2),

characterised in that said speed governer means (20) is provided on said cage
for detecting a running speed of said cage (3), said balancing spring (40) is arranged

to push up said wedge member (14) along said wedge guide
means (13) when the balance between said weight of said

wedge member (14) and said spring force (40) is lost by
excessively rapid descent of said cage (3), thereby pressing

said wedge member (14) against said guide rail (2) and
effecting an emergency stop of said cage (3) by means of a

third frictional force between said guide rail (2) and said
wedge member (14).
