<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronic visiting card with an automatic calling function (1) including a visual information medium and an integrated circuit comprising a microprocessor (2) at least one contactor (6 to 13), and audible emitter (4) and an electrical source (5). The electronic visiting card with an automatic calling function includes a read-only memory (3) associated with each contactor (6 to 13) containing prerecorded information representative of a telephone number to call, and action by a user on a contactor (6 to 13) causes a sound signal to be sent out which is coded on the basis of the prerecorded information, in such a way that the sound signal generates the dialing of the telephone number to call which it represents, when the audible emitter (4) is brought close to the microphone of a telephone handset.
