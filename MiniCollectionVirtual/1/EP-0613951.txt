<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel polysaccharides, 
a process for producing polysaccharides, uses of the 
polysaccharides and a strain producing the polysaccharides. 
The novel polysaccharides of the present invention may be 
used various fields, for example, as a humectant, a film-forming 
agent, an emulsifier, a foam stabilizer, a water-retaining 
agent and a cement admixture. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 
63-156707 (1988) proposes a cosmetic composition containing 
hyaluronic acid as a humectant. The humectant, when used in 
cosmetics, serves for mitigating stimulus from the outside 
and for protecting the skin from becoming rough, and also 
improves the touch to the skin of the cosmetics. Generally, 
a humectant used as a cosmetic material is desired to have a 
moisture retention within the range of 10 to 50% under an 
ordinary environmental condition with a relative humidity of 
40 to 80%. It is also required that its moisture retaining 
ability shouled be scarcely affected by the change of 
relative humidity (Fragrance Journal, special No. 9 "Science 
of Humectant", 1988, page 34, etc.). However, hyaluronic acid has a serious defect that its 
moisture retaining ability is unstable and tends to be 
influenced by ambient humidity.  As a result of extensive search for a material having 
excellent moisture retaining ability, the present inventors 
have found that novel polysaccharides obtained by using a 
novel microorganism have excellent moisture retaining 
ability which is hardly influenced by ambient relative 
humidity. It has been also found that the novel 
polysaccharides have other useful properties. The present 
invention has been achieved on the basis of these findings. An object of the present invention is to provide novel 
polysaccharides. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
process for producing polysaccharides and advantageous uses 
of the polysaccharides. Still another object of the present invention is to 
provide a novel microorganism of the genus Azotobacter. To achieve the aims, in a first aspect of the present 
invention, there are provided novel polysaccharides having 
the following physicochemical properties: 
(1) a molecular weight determined by gel filtration 
chromatography is about 5 × 10³ to 10 × 10⁶, (2) the constituent glycoses are D-galacturonic acid, 
L-rhamnose and D-glucose, (3) the constituent glycoses are joined substantially by 
1,3-linkages, and  (4) a configuration of D-galacturonic acid is α, that of 
L-rhamnose is β
