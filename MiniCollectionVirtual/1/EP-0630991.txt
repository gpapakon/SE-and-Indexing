<ABSTRACT>
An electroless gold plating bath comprising an aqueous solution of (a) chloroauric acid or a salt thereof, or 
a gold (I) complex salt of sulfurous or thiosulfuric acid as the gold source, (b) an alkali metal or ammonium salt of 

selected from among 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, 6-ethoxy-2-mercaptobenzothiazole, 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 2-mercaptobenzoxazole 
and salts thereof and further, if desired (f) an alkylamine compound. It can prevent precipitates 

from depositing when it is stored after the preparation or during the use thereof, can be used for long in a stable state, 
has a remarkably high plating rate, does not undergo any reduction in the plating rate even under a high bath load 

condition, can deal with a large amount of objects being plated in a short time, and can give a thick coating in a short 
time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electroless gold plating solution using chloroauric (III) acid or a salt thereof
or a sulfite or thiosulfate gold (I) complex salt as a gold source.Due to its excellent functional characteristics, electroless gold plating has been widely used in the field
of electronic industry where plating of complex fine circuits, isolated parts with difficult access to leads, etc.
is needed. As common electroless gold plating solutions there have been heretofore used those containing
cyanides of strong toxicity as a gold (I) ion-complexing agent, which are usually used at high temperatures
under strongly alkaline conditions. As a result, where they are used in such applications as mentioned
above, various problems are encountered, for example, separation of resists used for masking circuits or
corrosion of ceramic base materials by alkalis. Furthermore, cyanide-containing electroless gold plating
baths are extremely high in toxicity and thereby cause problems in their handling, storing and controlling as
well as with regard to the safety of working environments and the economy of waste liquid disposal.On the other hand, as a representative of gold plating solutions using no cyanides there has been
known a gold plating solution using a chloroaurate (III) as a gold source (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No.
4,142,902 and GB, A, 2114159). This chloroaurate (III) based gold plating solution, where a gold complex
salt is formed from the chloroaurate (III) and a sulfite or thiosulfate as a further ingredient, has been put into
practical use as cyanide-free plating solution.In addition those plating solutions using sodium chloroaurate (III) or sodium gold (I) thiosulfate as a gold
source and containing sodium sulfite and thiourea as further ingredients have been known from U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,804,559 and 4,880,464. With the plating solutions described in these U.S. Patents, plating, although
possible under weakly acidic conditions, proceeds at a low rate and high temperatures are required to raise
the plating rate. Furthermore, although continuous plating is possible therewith, plating has to be performed
for a long period of time even at a temperature of as high as 80°C if a film thickness of 5 µm or more is to
be achieved.The present inventors have previously provided an improvement in electroless gold plating solutions
with the above-described chloroaurate (III) as a gold source, which improvement comprises using ascorbic
acid as a reducing ingredient (see Japanese published unexamined patent
