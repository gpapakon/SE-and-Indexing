<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a control circuit for a magnetic valve. This control circuit (1) actuates the drive current of the magnetic valve (2) if the valve is to be switched from its passage to its closed position in such a way that the control current is first taken to a value beyond that (6) at which the valve begins to be released. The control current is, however, subsequently taken back to the range lying between the current (6) at which the valve closes and that (5) at which it goes into its passage position.

<CLAIMS>
Control for a solenoid valve which, after a
specific first actuation current value has been reached,

is adjusted from its closed position into its flow
position and, after a specific second actuation current

value has been reached, is adjusted from its flow position
into its closed position and in which, in addition,

the actuation current is influenced, characterized in
that when the valve is adjusted into its flow position

the actuation current is initially briefly, with respect
to the actuation period, adjusted beyond the second

actuation current value and subsequently adjusted into
the range between the first and second actuation current

value.
Control according to Claim 1 in which the valve
is in the closed position when the actuation current is

at a maximum, characterized in that the actuation current
is briefly zero.
Control according to Claim 1 in which the valve
is in its position when the actuation current is at a

maximum, characterized in that the actuation current is
briefly of the order of magnitude of 30% of the actuation

current for the closed position.
Control according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the actuation current is kept

constant between the first and second actuation current
value.
Control according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the control current is changed with

a predeterminable small gradient after being returned to
between the first and second actuation current value. 
Control according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that the control current is kept between the first and

second actuation current value until the next actuation
of the valve.
Control according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the actuation pulses are pulse

width-modulated.
