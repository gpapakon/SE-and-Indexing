<ABSTRACT>
A composition which inhibits the 
in vivo
 
formation of scar tissue at a surface of a device 

coated with the composition when the device is 
inserted at an 
in vivo
 site. The composition promotes 
growth of viable tissue at the site of insertion of a 

device and comprises a biocompatible polymer and an 
extracellular matrix molecule or fragment thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions and 
their use for modifying the biocompatibility of the 
surfaces of medical devices to prevent fouling of these 
devices. The development of implantable medical devices, 
such as artificial blood vessels, catheters, 
pacemakers, prosthetic implants, and drug delivery 
systems for the controlled release of therapeutics, 
represent a small fraction of material-dependent 
devices in a rapidly developing area. However, the 
long-term use of these implantable devices can be 
impaired by thrombosis, infection, as well as chronic 
inflammation, generally considered as fouling of these 
devices. The fouling can result in a decrease in 
device performance and longevity. Proteins deposited from the blood can initiate 
deposition of the cellular components within the blood 
onto the surface of the medical devices. This 
deposition constricts and hinders the use of devices 
such as artificial blood vessels. Inflammation, a 
natural response to an implant, can also initiate 
reactions that impede the function of devices such as 
ophthalmic lenses and pacemakers leads. Consequently, 
it is highly desirable to prevent such fouling of 
biomaterial surfaces. Fouling of a medical device can be prevented by 
modifying the surface of the device to inhibit 
fouling. Many different materials can be used to  
 
limit and inhibit fouling. One such material is 
polyethylene oxide (PEO). However, there are several 
problems associated with PEO coatings. A major problem with PEO is its high solubility 
in water. This necessitates the use of complex and 
expensive methods allowing the utilization of PEO as 
an anti-fouling coating material. These complex 
techniques include such methods as: covalent 
grafting; plasma polymerization; preparation of 
polymers containing pendant groups; preparation of 
block co-polymers; and the absorption of surfactants 
into a polymeric surface. The complexity of these 
techniques raises the level of difficulty in 
controlling coating uniformity, thickness and 
consistency. Furthermore, many of these reactions use 
catalysts and/or reaction initiators that result in 
undesirable reaction byproducts which have to be 
subsequently removed by separation techniques. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,177,056 describes the use 
of water insoluble PEO's terminated with 
bismethacrylates. These require a free radical 
initiator for polymerization, resulting in undesirable 
byproduct contaminants within the coating. Thus, many current techniques of applying
