treating surfaces while emitting little formaldehyde 

includes an open, lofty, three-dimensional nonwoven web 
of a plurality of thermoplastic organic fibers a bound 

together at places where they contact by a binder, 
binder comprising 1) a copolymer of an acrylate monomer 

and an acrylamide monomer, 2) the crosslinked reaction 
product of a polyol and a melamine crosslinking agent, 

and 3) the reaction product of a urea derivative and 
formaldehyde.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nonwoven surface
treating articles which are useful for surface
treatment, particularly polishing of various surfaces.The appearance of a surface may be indicated by
"shininess", or "gloss". The "gloss" produced by
buffing a surface with a surface treating article
attached to a conventional rotary floor machine depends
on a number of factors. Among these are the type of
abrasive article employed, the nature and amount of
ancillary chemical used (if any) with the article, the
pressure applied to the floor, the speed of rotation of
the article, the treatment time at given pressure, etc.
To ensure acceptable gloss production as a result of
the treatment procedure, the user tries to optimize all
of these parameters. The goal is a high gloss, high
durability, stain resistant floor, achieved with a
minimum of labor.Uniform, lofty, open, nonwoven three-dimensional
abrasive articles are known for use in cleaning and
polishing floors and other surfaces. Examples of such
nonwoven surface treating articles are the nonwoven
abrasive pads made according to the teachings of
Hoover, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,958,593; McAvoy, U.S.
Pat. No. 3,537,121; McAvoy, et al., U.S. Pat. No.
4,893,439; and McGurran, U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,496.Nonwoven abrasive pads such as disclosed by
McGurran, while finding wide ranging use, are
disadvantageous from a production standpoint since the
condensation polymerization reaction of the melamine
during curing may generate volatile organic
hydrocarbons (VOC). Various formaldehyde "scavengers",
such as phenol, urea, dicyanodiamide, and beta-ketobutyramide,
are known but each has its faults. Use 
of phenol is discouraged because it is a VOC.
Dicyanodiamide and beta-ketobutyramide are incompatible
with the melamine/PVC system because the system is
organic in nature, and dicyanodiamide and beta-ketobutyramide
are insoluble in the organic solvents
frequently employed in production facilities used to
dissolve or disperse the melamine/PVC. Urea is also
insoluble in the organic solvents employed in
production facilities, but can be incorporated into the
melamine/PVC system in dry form; however, the resulting
melamine/PVC/urea mixtures may be unstable. During the
time period required for coating fibrous webs, phase
separation of the urea from the melamine/PVC may occur,
which may not be eliminated by decreasing the urea
particle size.Urea, however, is much more soluble in aqueous
solutions than either dicyanodiamide and beta-ketobutyramide,
thus requiring less energy to remove
