<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of microprocessor systems, 
and more particularly, to a reset circuit for a microprocessor system. All computer systems have some type of reset circuit. The purpose of the 
reset circuit is to initialize a CPU's internal storage locations (e.g., the general state 
of the machine). Typically during a reset operation, all registers are set to zero, the 
interrupt system is disabled, the input/output interface is initialized, and the program 
counter is set to some initial value. The terms reset, power up (from a cold or warm 
start), and boot are used interchangeably throughout this document. Typically, the 
reset signal is generated external to the CPU. It is extremely important that the system designer design the system to 
guarantee that the CPU starts last after the reset pin becomes inactive. Once the 
reset funtions of the CPU begin, the CPU is initialized to some predetermined state 
and a defined sequence of events begins. It is essential that all the chips peripheral 
to the CPU initialize before the CPU is allowed to access their memory locations; 
otherwise, the CPU will be accessing invalid data. The present invention provides a reset circuit having 
the features of patent claim 1. The reset circuit of 
the present invention has two different threshold input 
voltages and is designed to control the reset functions of two 
separate devices. According to a preferred embodiment, the 
second device is a processor and the first device is located 
peripheral to the processor. The reset circuit guarantees 
that the processor will start working after the peripheral 
devices subsequent to power up. Further, the present invention provides a method for 
resetting a system having a reset circuit as defined in patent 
claim 5.  
 This invention is pointed out with particularity in the appended claims. The 
above and further advantages of this invention may be better understood by 
referring to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
FIG. 1 is a general illustration of the conventional means for resetting a 
system architecture comprising CPU 105 and a plurality of chips 110 peripheral to 
CPU 105; FIG. 2 is a detailed schematic of a reset circuit 200 of the present invention; FIG. 3 is a timing diagram which illustrates the switching characteristics of 
the two different threshold input voltages associated with buffers 250 and 260; FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of buffer 250; and FIG. 5 is a schematic

<CLAIMS>
A reset circuit (200) for resetting at least a first 
and second device, the circuit comprising: 


(a) a first buffer (250) with a first threshold 
voltage level, the input of said first buffer being 

connected to a reset signal and the output of said 
first buffer (250) being connected to trigger the 

reset function of at least one first device; and 
(b) a second buffer (260) with a second threshold 
voltage level that is higher than said first threshold 

voltage level, the input of said second buffer being 
connected to said reset signal and the output of said 

second buffer (260) being connected to trigger the 
reset function of a second device (210), 
 
wherein said first buffer (250) and said second buffer 

(260) are located within said second device (210). 
The circuit of claim 1, wherein said second device is 
a central processing unit (210). 
The circuit of claim 2, wherein said first device 
being a device peripheral to said central processing 

unit (210). 
The circuit of claim 3, further comprising a third 
buffer (240) connected betweeen the output of said  

 
first buffer (250) and said at least one peripheral 

device, said third buffer provides isolation and 
increased fan-out so that said first buffer can drive 

more peripherals. 
A method for resetting a microprocessor system, 
comprising the steps of: 


(1) receiving a single reset signal; and 
(2) generating, within a processor (210), a 
peripheral device reset signal (230) and a processor 

reset signal (270) from said single reset signal, 
wherein said peripheral device reset signal (230) 

activates the reset circuitry of the devices 
peripheral to said processor (210) before activating 

the reset circuitry of said processor. 
The method of claim 5, wherein said generating step 
further comprises the steps of: 


(a) providing the output of a first buffer (250) 
with a first threshold voltage level to the devices 

peripheral to said processor (210), said output of 
said first buffer (250) being said peripheral device 

reset signal; and 
(b) providing the output of a second buffer (260) 
with a second threshold voltage level to said 

processor (210) wherein said second threshold voltage level is 
higher than said first threshold voltage level, said 

output of said second buffer being said processor 
reset signal (270). 
The method of claim 6, further comprising the steps 
of:  

 

(1) applying said reset signal (220) to the first 
buffer (250) and the second buffer (260), 
(2) outputting, at a first time, said peripheral 
device reset signal (230) from said first buffer (250) 

to initialize said peripheral devices; and 
(3) outputting, at a second later time, said 
processor reset signal (270) from said second buffer 

(260) to initialize said processor (210).
