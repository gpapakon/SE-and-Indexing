An instrument (10) for use in surgery is provided. The instrument has a heating element (12) with a working surface for providing hemostasis at an auto-regulated temperature. The heating element (12) may be disposed on a flexible elongated shaft (18) for use in endoscopic surgery, or a shorter shaft (18A) for use in open surgical procedures. The working surface may include a tapered edge (11) for providing thermally-enhanced cutting and a non-stick coating for operating the instrument at low auto-regulation temperatures. A process for making such instruments and methods of employing such devices in performing surgery are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Surgical Instruments Having Auto-Regulating HeaterThis invention relates to resistively-heated instruments for use in open surgical procedures and endoscopic surgery. More particularly, this invention relates to surgical instruments having an auto- regulating heating element.Background Of The Invention It is known to provide surgical scalpels which employ a blade with an adjacent resistive heating element. The resistive heating element provides thermally-enhanced cutting, in addition to hemostasis, when electrical current is passed through the element. Although such resistive heating elements can be readily brought to a suitably high and constant temperature in air prior to contacting tissue, they rapidly cool when brought into contact with tissue. During surgery, non- predictable and continually varying portions of the blade contact the tissue as it is being cut. As the blade cools, its ability to cut tissue and provide hemostasis becomes markedly less effective. Furthermore, tissue tends to adhere to the blade. If additional power is applied by conventional means to counteract this cooling, the additional power may be 

delivered to the uncooled portions of the blade, thus resulting in tissue damage and blade deterioration.Shaw U.S. Patent No. 4,185,632 shows a surgical cutting instrument comprising a ceramic substrate having thin conducting layers bonded to either side. Radio frequency electrical currents conducted through the thin conducting layers heat and maintain the blade temperature within an elevated preselected temperature range. These currents flow within variable skin depths in the thin conducting layers disposed near the cutting edge of the blade. This variable skin depth effect produces self- regulation of the blade temperature.Although the cutting instrument shown in the above-referenced Shaw U.S. Patent No. 4,185,632 has improved temperature regulation over other surgical scalpels, further improvements are possible. For example, such instruments may be designed to provide low cost and simplicity of manufacturing. In addition, instruments having self- regulating heating elements may be advantageous for use in endoscopic surgery to provide hemostasis and the ability to remotely cut and dissect operative tissue. Ideally, incisions made during endoscopic surgery should only occur in regions where it is desired to cut or dissect. However, since previously known endoscopic instruments must pass through tissue masses to gain access to operative sites, there is the potential that the cutting
