<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing an electron source having 
a plurality of surface-conduction electron-emitting 

devices arranged on a substrate in row and column 
directions includes the forming of electron emission 

portions of the plurality of surface-conduction 
electron-emitting devices. The forming is carried out 

by supplying current through the plurality of surface-conduction 
electron-emitting devices upon dividing them 

into a plurality of groups. An image forming apparatus 
passes a current through a plurality of electron 

sources, which are formed on a substrate and arrayed in 
the form of a matrix, in dependence upon an image 

signal, and an image is formed by a light emission in 
response to electrons emitted from the plurality of 

electron sources.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 
a method of manufacturing the electron source according to the preamble of claims 1 and 13. Two types of electron sources, namely thermionic 
sources and cold cathode electron sources, are known as 
electron-emitting devices. Examples of cold cathode 
electron sources are electron-emitting devices of the 
field emission type (abbreviated to "FE" below), 
metal/insulator/metal type (abbreviated to "MIM" below) 
and surface-conduction emission type (abbreviated to 
"SCE". Known examples of the FE type are described by 
W.P. Dyke and W.W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advance in 
Electron Physics, 8,89 (1956) and by C.A. Spindt, 
"Physical properties of thin-film field emission 
cathodes with molybdenum cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47,5248 
(1976). A known example of the MIM type is described by 
C.A. Mead, "The tunnel-emission amplifier", J. Appl.  
 
Phys., 32,616 (1961). A known example of the SCE type is described by 
M.I. Elinson, Radio. Eng. Electron Phys., 10 (1965). The SCE type makes use of a phenomenon in which an 
electron emission is produced in a small-area thin film, 
which has been formed on a substrate, by passing a 
current parallel to the film surface. Various examples of this surface-conduction 
electron-emitting device have been reported. One relies 
upon a thin film of SnO2 according to Elinson, mentioned 
above. Other examples use a thin film of Au [G. 
Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", 9,317 (1972)]; a thin film 
of In2O3/SnO2 (M. Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad: "IEEE 
Trans. E.D. Conf.", 519 (1975); and a thin film of 
carbon (Hisashi Araki, et al: "Vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, 
p. 22 (1983). Fig. 1 illustrates the construction of the device 
according to M. Hartwell, described above. This device 
is typical of the surface-conduction electron-emitting 
device. As shown in Fig. 1, numeral 1 denotes an 
insulative substrate. Numeral 2 denotes a thin film for 
forming an electron emission portion. The thin film 2 
comprises a thin film of a metal oxide formed into an H-shaped 
pattern by sputtering. An electron emission 
portion 3 is formed by an electrification process 
referred to as "forming", described below. Numeral 4  
 
designates a thin film, which includes the electron 
emission portion 3. Further, spacing L1 between device 
electrodes is set to 0.5 ∼ 1 mm, and W is set to 0.1 mm. 
It should be noted that since the position and shape of 
the electron emission portion 3 is unknown, this is 
represented schematically. In these conventional surface-conduction
