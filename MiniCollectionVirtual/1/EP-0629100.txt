<ABSTRACT>
Method and arrangement intended to allow transmission, via a link operated in cell mode between two telecommunication installation units, of information previously supplied to one of the two units via a link in narrow band circuit mode, when the two units are respectively managed in circuit mode. The arrangement for implementing the method according to the invention involves the implementation of at least two combined units (3) linked, on the one hand, together by a link for cell mode and, on the other hand, each linked to a unit and/or to terminals, supporting the circuit mode. Each combined unit includes a communication circuit (9 or 13) for its exchanges in each of the modes, as do the units with which it communicates in one of these modes, and a gateway circuit (14) putting the information modules transmitted by a time-division multiplex link in circuit mode into cell mode in the course of a frame and, conversely, recovery of the information modules contained in a received cell.

Method of transmitting over a cell mode link between two telecommunication
installation units data previously supplied in time-division multiplexed form and

consequently in modular form to one of the two units by means of one or more
basic narrowband circuit mode channels when the two units are respectively

controlled in circuit mode in synchronous manner or by two plesiochronous
clocks, consisting in:


forcing the transmission priority on the cell mode link of each data module
previously in circuit mode which is intended to be communicated from one unit to

the other so that each of said data modules is inserted into the first cell
transmitted by the unit responsible for transmission, after it is received by the

latter,
and re-inserting said data modules successively communicated in cell mode to
said destination unit cyclically into one or more specific channels under the

control of the clock controlling the narrowband circuit mode at the destination
unit, so allowing integral output of the data in its original form;
characterized in that
 the circuit mode clock at a destination unit is also aligned to
a first circuit mode basic channel clock on the basis of the data from which the

data modules have been formed, successively produced at a frame timing rate
set by said first clock and subsequently received in cell mode via a unit operating

in both said modes,

said alignment being achieved by means of an average value type signal
obtained from the received cells, on the basis of occurrences of a marker

comprising a characteristic combination of data appearing at the frame timing
rate and subject to jitter associated with transmission in the form of cells for the

data emanating from at least one of the channels transmitted.
System for implementing the method according to claim 1 for a
telecommunications installation including narrowband circuit mode units (1) for

narrowband circuit mode terminals (6), said units being interconnected by point-to-point
links (NL) specifically adapted and temporally controlled for this mode

and cell mode units (2) connected by point-to-point links (BL) specifically adapted
and controlled for cell mode, possibly via one or more switching elements of a

cell switching organization (5) of the installation, said system including at least
two hybrid units (3) connected to each other by a cell mode link and each to a

circuit mode unit and/or terminals; 

each hybrid unit which is provided with a communication circuit (9 or 13) for
communications in each of the modes, and likewise the units with which it

communicates in one of said modes, further including a gateway circuit (14) for
converting to cell form data modules transmitted by a circuit mode time-division

multiplex link during a frame and conversely restoring data modules contained in
a received cell to their original time position, before conversion to cell mode,

during the frame in which they are output in circuit mode;
characterized in that
 at least one of the hybrid units (3) has means for aligning
the circuit mode clock supplied locally by its timebase module (11) for at least

one circuit mode terminal (6) and/or circuit mode unit (1) to a first clock timing
circuit mode basic channels on the basis of data from which the data modules

are formed, successively produced at a frame timing rate fixed by said first clock
and subsequently received in cell mode by the hybrid unit;
said means including a filter supplying a local clock alignment signal from the
data modules received;
said filter producing an average value type alignment signal on the basis of
occurrences of a marker comprising a characteristic combination of data

appearing at the frame timing rate and subject to jitter associated with
transmission in the form of cells, for data emanating from at least one of the

channels transmitted.
System according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 each hybrid unit includes a
gateway circuit (14) incorporating mode changing means (15) for creating a cell

into which are inserted the data modules supplied by a time-division multiplex
link during a frame and for redistributing on the channels of a time-division

multiplex link that it serves the data modules contained in a received cell so as to
reposition them in time, as they were originally, during the frame for transmitting

them.
System according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 each hybrid unit includes a cell
mode communication circuit incorporating means (20, 21) for assigning

priorities to cells to be transmitted including a high priority level for cells
transmitting data modules supplied and to be output in circuit mode and parallel

structured transfer buffer means (17 to 19) for transmitting cells between hybrid
units according to the priorities assigned and transmitting high priority cells in a

time period shorter for each cell than the time allotted to sending a cell.
System according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 each hybrid unit includes a 
cell mode communication circuit (13) further including parallel structured transfer

buffer means (24, 26, 27) for separating cells received from another hybrid unit
according to priority indications assigned by the latter and for compensating in

conjunction with the mode changing means (15) of the gateway circuit of the
same hybrid unit the variable time-delays introduced by transmission in cell

mode for each group of bytes corresponding to the data modules to be output in
circuit mode contained in one of the successive cells received addressed to the

same time-division multiplex link.
