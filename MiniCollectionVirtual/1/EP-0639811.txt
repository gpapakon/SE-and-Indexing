<ABSTRACT>
A disk array (10) has a plurality of disks (12), a disk array controller 
(14) for coordinating data transfer to and from the disks, and a RAID 

management system (16) for mapping two different RAID areas (42,44) onto 
the disks. The RAID management system (16) stores data in one of the RAID 

areas according to mirror redundancy, and stores data in the other RAID area 
according to parity redundancy. The RAID management system (16) then shifts 

or migrates data between the mirror and parity RAID areas on the disks in 
accordance with a predefined performance protocol, such as data access 

recency or access frequency. A method for managing data on a disk array is 
also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to non-volatile memory systems with the
capability of detecting failures, such as computer disk arrays, having data
storage redundancy management.Computer systems are constantly improving in terms of speed,
reliability, and processing capability. As a result, computers are able to handle
more complex and sophisticated applications. However, as computers improve,
performance demands placed on mass storage and input/output (I/O) devices
increase. In general, I/O performance has had difficulty keeping pace with the
growing capabilities of the computers.The mass storage industry faces two primary challenges: (1) to
improve I/O performance so that data access does not become a limiting factor
for an application, and (2) to provide access to on-line data at levels of reliability
well in excess of the expected lifetimes of the computer systems that process
it. See, The RAIDBook: A Source Book for RAID Technology, published June
9, 1993, by the RAID Advisory Board, Lino Lakes, Minnesota It is desirable that
storage devices meet these goals in a cost-effective manner.The performance of present disk I/O systems is limited because
data stored thereon is located by comparatively slow processes of seeking and
disk rotation. Additionally, the data is transferred to and from the disk media in
a serial bit stream which also inhibits speed. Manufacturers, therefore, attempt
to design systems which rearrange data on the disks in such a manner that the
more frequently accessed data is evenly distributed across the I/O resources.There are three primary design criteria for mass storage systems:
cost, performance, and availability. It is most desirable to produce memory
devices that have a low cost per megabit, a high input/output performance, and
high data availability. "Availability" is the ability to recover data stored in the 
storage system even though some of the data has become inaccessible due to
failure or some other reason and the ability to insure continued operation in the
event of such failure. Typically, data availability is provided through the use of
redundancy wherein data, or relationships among data, are stored in multiple
locations.There are two common methods of storing redundant data.
According to the first or "mirror" method, data is duplicated and stored in two
separate areas of the storage system. For example, in a disk array, the identical
data is provided on two separate disks in the disk array. The mirror method has
the advantages of high performance and high data

space having first and second areas (42,44), the first area holding data

according to a first RAID level and the second area holding data
according to a second RAID level;

   mapping the first virtual storage space (40) into a second virtual storage
space (50) having multiple blocks (52,53), the blocks representing the

first and second RAID level areas;

(a) converting an unused and undesignated RAID area into a
second block representing the second RAID level area;
b) locating an unused block representing the first RAID level area

RAID level area to the unused block to make the used block
