<ABSTRACT>
The device has a reader (202) for scanning a graphical original and for outputting electrical signals corresponding to pixels on a first line (206) which is connected to a transmitting module (S) of a receiver/transmitter unit (E/S) to which a telecommunications line (242) is connected. A printer (204), which is connected to a receiver module (E) of the receiver/transmitter unit (E/S) via a second line (212) and to the reader (202) via a third line (216), can receive data to be printed from the receiver module (E) and the reader (202). The data can be stored in a first memory (220) and a second memory (222) which are connected to the first line (206) and, respectively, the second line (212), a device operator acting on switches (230, 232) and initiating the storage.

Device for sending and receiving graphical
documents to be transmitted via teletransmission lines,

comprising:

a reading device (202) for scanning a graphical original
and for outputting electrical signals corresponding to

image points on a first line (206) which is connected to
a transmitting module (S) of a receiver/transmitter unit

(E/S), to which a teletransmission line (242) is
connected,
a printer (204), which is connected via a second line
(212) to a receiver module (E) of the receiver/transmitter

unit (E/S) and via a third line (216) to the
reading device (202), and can receive data to be printed

from the receiver module (E) and the reading
device (202),
a first memory (220) and a second memory (222), which are
connected to the first line (206) and the second line

(212) respectively,
a first switch (230) and a second switch (232), which are
connected into the first line (206) and the second line

(212) respectively,
and a device operating system (238), which acts on the
memories (220, 222) and the switches (230, 232),
with the result that either

a) the first memory (220) stores data which are generated
by the reading device (202) and arrive on the first line

(206), while at the same time, occupying the teletransmission
line (242), data are received from the

receiver module (E) via the second line (212), and after
completing the reception of the data from the receiver 

module (E) and releasing the teletransmission line (242),
the data stored in the first memory (220) being transmitted

via the teletransmission line (242) via the first
line (206) and the transmitter module (S),

or
b) the second memory (222) stores data which arrive at
the receiver module (E) via the teletransmission line

(242) during a transmission operation, and are led onto
the second line (212), while the printer (204) is

occupied, and after the printer (204) becomes free, the
data stored in the second memory (222) being fed to the

printer (204) via the second line (212) and printed out.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that an external EDP system (224) has a fourth connecting

line (226) and a fifth connecting line (228), which can
be connected to the first connecting line (206) via the

first switch (230) or, respectively, to the second line
(212) via the second switch (232).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that data contained in the EDP system (224) can be

transmitted to the transmitting module (S) via the first
connecting line (226) and the first switch (230).
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that data incoming via the receiver module (E) can be

transmitted to the EDP system (224) via the second line
(212), the second switch (232) and the second connecting

line (228).
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that data generated by the reading device

(202) can be transmitted to the EDP system (224) via the
first switch (230) and the first connecting line (226).
Device according to one of the preceding Claims 2
to 5, characterized in that data can be transmitted from

the EDP system (224) into the printer (204) via the
second connecting line (228) and the second switch (232).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that there is connected into the third

line (216) between the reading device (202) and the 
printer (204) a device (218) which converts image point

signals outgoing from the reading device (202) into image
point signals which can be used for the printer (204),

without at the same time changing the high resolution
quality of the reading device (202).
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the device operating system (238) can also act in a

controlling manner on the device (218).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the switches (230, 232) can be

controlled individually by the device operating
system (238).
