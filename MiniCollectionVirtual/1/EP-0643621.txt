<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally concerned with the 
production of attrition-resistant binder formulations 
such as those used to bind catalyst particles into 
those forms (e.g., microspheroids) which are commonly 
employed in fluid catalytic cracking processes. More 
particularly, this invention is concerned with the use 
of certain inexpensive, naturally occurring clay 
materials, e.g., kaolinites -in place of certain more 
expensive, synthetic materials, e.g., synthetic silica 
and/or alumina materials - as principle ingredients in 
such binder formulations. Clays have been used in catalyst matrix systems 
for many years. For example, one very important 
development in petroleum "cracking" was the catalytic 
decomposition of gas oil in the presence of certain 
naturally occurring clays such as kaolinites in an 
atmosphere of the gas oil's own vapor. However, the 
use of such clays as catalysts per se has diminished 
over the years. There were several reasons for this.  
 
One of the most important of these reasons was the 
fact that most naturally occurring clays lack the 
quality of "attrition-resistance" which is very 
important in any catalytic system which places its 
catalyst particles in "fluid motion." Moreover, 
catalytic clays of this type also have to be 
extensively treated before they can be used as 
"cracking catalysts." For example U.S. Patent 
2,848,423 notes that in order for its particular 
process to be effective, its kaolin catalyst 
ingredient first has to be "sized" in order to obtain 
kaolin particles of less than about 2 microns. These 
sized particles are then aggregated and subjected to 
elevated temperatures. The resulting materials are 
thereafter treated with hydrogen sulfide at about 
1200Â°F in order to form aggregates which, in turn, are 
exposed to ammonium chloride in order to selectively 
remove any iron present in the kaolin aggregates. The need for so many preparatory steps, in 
conjunction with the fact that catalyst particles 
having high kaolin concentrations are subject to 
unacceptable attrition losses, provided a great deal 
of motivation to find more suitable catalyst 
materials. Eventually a large variety of other 
amorphous catalytic materials, and especially those 
having large proportions of alumina, were developed. 
The use of these materials represented a very 
significant step in this art because not only were 
these other alumina-containing materials more 
catalytically active than kaolin clays, they also were 
generally much more attrition-resistant.
