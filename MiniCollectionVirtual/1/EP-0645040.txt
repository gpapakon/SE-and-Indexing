<ABSTRACT>
An expanded annunciator of the status of individual switches in a series circuit of interlock switches, has a schematic of the series circuit printed on its display panel face. Display elements such a light-emitting diodes are juxtaposed to the switches, and emit light to symbolize that the switches are conducting. Preferably, the schematic is printed with individual switch symbols arranged in a line, and lines are drawn on the panel face from individual display elements to the lines symbolizing the conductors whose voltage level is displayed by the display element involved.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DISPLAY PANEL ASSOCIATING SERIESCIRCUIT INTERLOCK SWITCH CONDUCTIONSTATUS INDICATORS WITH CIRCUIT TOPOLOGY< 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION+Many types of control systems are used to operate apparatus which has the potential for causing harm or injury if various parameter levels are outside of predetermined ranges. A simple example is the automobile whose engine will be severely damaged if the oil pressure is too low or the coolant temperature is too high.10 In this situation the system relies on the good judgment of the driver to stop the auto as soon as the warning light or gauge indicates the problem.In many of these systems however, human monitoring of the apparatus parameters may be unacceptable because the apparatus is intended to operate automatically, or because the result of improper, that is to say human, monitoring15 may result in serious damage or injury. Neither is it desirable to rely on the control system to monitor every one of these parameter levels and shut down of the system when needed because this adds substantial complexity to the controller. Also, the control system can on occasion fail, for example because of power outages. Instead, in most systems these parameters are used to directly control interlock switches which20 open if the parameter level is outside of the predetermined range. In these systems, the interlock switches are typically arranged in a series circuit which passes the current for operating the apparatus (and parts of the control system as well in many cases) so that if any of the parameter levels are outside the range specified for it, the apparatus will not receive power and cannot operate. Examples of these series25 circuits of interlock switches are found in a number of different types of apparatus and their controls, including as one example burner systems and controls. In burner controls, the interlock switch series circuit is used to control power which operates the fuel valves. If any of the burner system parameters are outside the specified ranges, power is not available to the fuel valves, with the result that the burner cannot30 operate.There are as many as a dozen or more of these individual interlock switches employed in a typical installation. These switches will usually be physically located at various sites in the installation which are separated from each other. Thus, switches which are adjacent to each other in the series circuit sequence, may be35 physically separated by many feet or even yards. This is because the most convenient or logical
