<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides elastic fabrics which are substantially non-extensible in the machine direction and have substantial elastic properties in the cross-machine direction. The process stable fabrics of the invention include a net and a fibrous layer which are secured together. The net is composed of a plurality of continuous machine direction strands and a plurality of cross-direction strands. The machine direction strands are substantially non-extensible and the cross-direction strands are substantially elastic. The fabrics of the invention can be manufactured and processed more readily than fabrics which are elastic in both the machine direction and the cross-machine direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS STABLE NONWOVEN FABRICField of the Invention The invention relates to process stable composite elastic nonwoven fabrics and to processes for producing them. More specifically, the invention relates to process stable composite nonwoven elastic fabrics having desirable strength, conformability, and stretch and recovery properties, and which can be more readily manufactured and processed using existing textile equipment as compared to prior nonwoven fabrics.Background of the Invention Nonwoven elastic fabrics have been the subject of considerable attention and effort. Elastic fabrics are desirable for use in bandaging materials, garments, diapers, supportive clothing and personal hygiene products because of their ability to conform to irregular shapes and to allow more freedom of body movement than fabrics with limited extensibility.Elastomeric materials have been incorporated into various fabric structures to provide stretchable fabrics. In many instances, such as where the fabrics are made by knitting or weaving, there can be a relatively high cost associated with the fabric. In cases where the fabrics are made using nonwoven technologies, the fabric can suffer from insufficient 

strength and only limited stretch and recovery properties.Elastomers used to fabricate elastic fabrics often have an undesirable rubbery feel. This is particularly true with thermoplastic elastomers rather than cross-linked elastomers. When these materials are used in composite nonwoven fabrics, the hand and texture of the fabric can be perceived by the user as sticky or rubbery and therefore undesirable. Nonwoven fabrics having thermoplastic elastomers incorporated into the fabric structure can be extremely difficult to process and to manufacture. For example, tension control during fabric manufacture and/or during downstream processing can be extremely critical. A small change in tension can result in stretching or recovery of the fabric which can lead to a non-uniformly manufactured product. Tension control is even more aggravated when heating is required, for example, during fabric drying, adhesive application, lamination, thermal bonding or other thermal treatment. When subjected to heat and tension, the fabric can stretch and otherwise undergo greater distortion than when the fabric is at room temperature. In addition, thermoplastic elastomers can lose elastic properties when stressed at elevated temperatures and allowed to cool fully or partially while stressed, and/or the thermoplastic fibers and filaments are
