<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an antenna allowing application or irradiation by microwaves. - The subject of the invention is an antenna for microwaves characterised in that it is multipolarising, closed at each of its ends by an isotropic or anisotropic reflection short circuit, (causing the polarisation plane of the waves to turn), fed directly by one or more generators in TE11 mode and the central, fixed or rotating part (B) of which is equipped over almost its whole length with one or more non-resonant elongate slot or slots, matched at their extremities (7, 8) inclined with respect to the generatrices of the cylinder. - Application to devices for application of microwaves.
