<ABSTRACT>
A case for storing and cleaning contact lenses comprising a container (3) being filled with suitable cleaning liquid and a movable mechanism screwed on top (2) of the container. The contact lenses are mounted at suitable locations of the movable mechanism so that they may be immersed within the cleaning liquid and each lies in between a pair of reversely rotating blade bearing means (7, 8, 11). These blade bearing means are set in alternate clockwise and anticlockwise rotation when a top head cover (2) of the case is pressed downwards and then returns under the action of a compression spring (16). This operation results in the above blades mildly sweeping off any proteinic or other remnants from both the inner concave and outer convex surfaces of the contact lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
 _\L\_l_l-.L_- -._l_-_l _-_ _-_l_l_\_._lL_l_\-_ __ΪHE_FIELD_OF_THE_INVENTIQNThe invention relates to a case for the storing of contact lenses comprising means for the removal of the proteinic and other remnants both from the inner and outer surfaces of the lenses.THE BACKGROUND ARTCases for contact lenses of the prior art are simple, smal l baskets, wherein contact lenses are immersed and kept within puri fying and preserving l iquids. In this manner the lenses can be disinfected, but the organic remnants on the surface of the lenses, which are the main cause of irritation of the eye and of dimness of the lenses themselves, are not removed. That's why in many systems of contact lenses cleaning, soft rubbing of the lenses in between the fingers or with a special cloth is suggested before the steri l ization. This speci fic activity is however a very fine process and y be dangerous for the integrity of the lens, whereas it certainly reduces its service l ife.For the same purpose, micro-apparatuses of osci l lation of the contact lenses within the l iquid of purification have been lso manufactured. However such devices are bulky, they 

function with batteries and they are not sufficiently e fective.The object of the present invention is therefore to efficiently overcome the abovement 1 oned problems and drawbacks of the prior art by providing a case for storing contact lenses, wherein the lenses may also be cleaned by simple manual oper tion.The case of the present invention can on the one hand be used as a typical case in the form of a smal l basket for the contact lenses and on the other hand it comprises an incorporated system of thin soft rubber blades. The blades can move and rotate on the same axis in both clockwise and anticlockwise course of rotation by instantaneously pressing a part of the apparatus with the finger. By means of their rotation, the blades sweep the inner and outer surfaces of the lenses which have been placed in between them, thereby removing every foreign object, proteinic and other remnants stuck upon the lenses.The blades are made from soft rubber and they are properly shaped so that the lenses may fit in between them and thereby avoid being damaged or harassed during rubbing.The entire case is sl ightly larger than a conventional case, it is air-tight and water-tight, and is as handy to use as the conventional case. Further, the proposed case can be used in relation with al l avai lable contact lens cleaning systems, offering a substantial improvement in their cleaning per
