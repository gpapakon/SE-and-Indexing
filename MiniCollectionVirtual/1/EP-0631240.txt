<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a data transmission circuit having a slave device (3), a master device (2) and a two-wire bus (6) for transmitting digital information between them. The master device (2) produces a potential difference (V(t)) between the said two wires so as to provide the said slave device (3) with energy and comprises means (41) for producing pulses in the said potential difference (V(t)), the said pulses having an amplitude representative of the said digital information. The slave device (3) comprises means (20) for decoding the pulses in order to detect the said pulses and in order to produce a synchronising signal (Clk) upon the detection of each of the said pulses. Thus, the master device can transmit information, energy and the synchronising signals to the slave device on two lines only, without requiring a local clock in the slave device.
