<ABSTRACT>
A logical comb filter comprises a logic decision section (16, 
17) for making logical decisions on the selection of signals and a 

signal generating section for generating signals to be selected 
according to the logical decisions. In the signal generating section, 

a band-pass filter (5) extracts from the input of a composite video 
signal a signal component centring on a colour sub-carrier frequency, 

and first and second delay lines (7, 9) generate three line signals 
based on an inverted output of the band-pass filter (5). A first mean 

level calculator (11, 13) calculates the mean level between the main 
signal and a first delay signal obtained as the inverted output of the 

first delay line (7), and a second mean level calculator (12, 15) 
calculates the mean level between the first delay signal and a second 

delay signal obtained as the inverted output of the second delay line 
(9). One of the output signals and the first delay signal is then 

selected by a changeover means (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to logical comb filters . Such
filters may, for example, be used in video apparatus to separate a
luminance signal (Y) from a chrominance signal (C).In separating vertically a luminance signal (Y) from a
chrominance signal (C) in video apparatus, a logical comb filter
employs logic circuits to carry out comparisons of three line signals,
corresponding to previous, present and next lines, so as to minimise
signal irregularities (dot disturbance, discolouring, etc.) resulting
from the use of the signals with low vertical correlation.Figure 6 shows a typical logical comb filter a of the NTSC
standard comprising an input terminal b through which a composite
signal (Y+C)I is input. The input signal (Y+C)I is supplied via a 1H
delay line c to a subtracter d, and also to a band-pass filter e whose
centre frequency is fsc (the colour sub-carrier frequency).The signal in the vicinity of fsc, when extracted by the
band-pass filter e is supplied to a 1H delay line g via a NOT circuit
f which supplies an output signal A0, the bar meaning inversion of
phase. The signal on the 1H delay line g is then supplied to a NOT
circuit h that generates a signal A1 delayed by 1H relative to the
signal A0.In addition, a 1H delay line i and a NOT circuit j downstream
thereof derive a signal A2 delayed by 1H relative to the signal A1.The three line signals A0, A1 and A2, obtained with the 1H
time spacing therebetween, are processed by logic operation units k
and l which comprise MAX and MIN circuits, the MAX circuits extracting
the signals whose levels are the highest, and the MIN circuits
extracting the signals whose levels are the lowest.Specifically, in the logic operation unit k, the signals A0
and A1 are supplied to a MIN circuit m, and the signals A1 and A2 are
supplied to a MIN circuit n. The outputs from the MIN circuits m and
n are supplied to a MAX circuit o whose output is in turn supplied to
an adder p.In the logic operation unit l, the signals A0 and A1 are
supplied to a MAX circuit q and the signals A1 and A2 are supplied to
a MAX circuit r. The outputs from the MAX circuits q and r are 
supplied to a MIN circuit s whose output in turn is supplied to the
adder p.The output from the adder p is output as a C (chrominance)
signal C0 via a multiplier t having a coefficient of 1/2. The adder
output is also supplied to the subtracter d wherein the signal C0 is
subtracted from the 1H delayed signal of the input signal (Y+C)I to
provide a luminance signal Y0.In the above-described logical comb filter
