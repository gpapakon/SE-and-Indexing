<ABSTRACT>
A tool for punching out single and multiple containers from plastic foil of high elongation at tear, especially from polypropylene foil, has a plurality of knives for cutting into the foil and cutting through it which can be advanced in a specific way via a press. The tool is characterised by a cutting plate 6 with recessed and raised cutting perforations 34 and 36 which cooperate with the knives 10, 14, 18, furthermore by at least two receiving plates 8, 12, 16 arranged in succession in the direction of advance and intended for the knives, the knives 14 and 18 or their knife mountings passing respectively through the receiving plates 8, 12 arranged in the direction of advance in front of the receiving plates 12, 16 assigned to them, and by adjustably designed stops 26, 28 which take effect simultaneously or at different times and are intended for the receiving plates and which fix the amount of the advancing travels of the knives. This design provides a tool for punching out containers from plastic foils of high elongation at tear, by means of which, on the one hand, individual containers also consisting of multiple packs can be separated easily without an aid and, on the other hand, the selective production of individual or multiple packs with different numbers of containers is possible without a complicated demounting and resetting of the tool.

Apparatus for cutting individual pots and packs of 
pots out of a plastics sheet with a high elongation at 

break, particulary out of a polypropylene sheet, 
comprising a plurality of knives (10, 14, 18) for scoring 

and cutting through the sheet which may be advanced by a 
press in a defined manner, and a die plate (6) having 

depressed and raised cutting holes (34 and 36) which 
cooperate with the knives (10, 14, 18), characterized by 


at least two carrying plates (8, 12, 16) for the 
knives (10, 14, 18), the plates being arranged one 

behind the other in the direction of advance, 
wherein the knives (14 and 18) or their carriers 

which pass in the direction of approach through the 
carrier plates (8, 12) arranged before the carrier 

plates (12, 16) associated therewith, and 
stops (26, 28) for the carrier plates (8, 12), the 
stops being adjustable, acting at the same or 

different time and serving for the determination of 
the length of the paths of advancement of the knives 

(10, 14). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the carrier plates include at least two holding 

plates (8, 12) and a top plate (16). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
that compression springs (24, 25) or gas cylinders for 

the setting of the cutting forces and pretension are 
arranged between the carrier plates (8, 12, 16). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the die plate (6) and the stops (26, 28) are  

 
arranged on a bottom plate (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 4, characterized 
by wedge-shaped slides (50, 50') for the adjustment of 

the length of the stops (26, 28). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the knives include knives 

(10) with straight cutting edges (30) for cutting through 
or scoring the sheet, knives (14) with concave cutting 

edges (32) for selectably cutting through or scoring to 
produce a thin film where tearing is desired and lateral 

cutting through to produce lateral scoring, and star-shaped 
punches (18) for the trimming of the pot corners 

to provide rounding (19). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the knives (10) with straight cutting edges (30) are 

provided on the holding plate (8) next to the die plate 
(6),
 
the knives (14) with the concave edges are fixed on the 

next following holding plate (12) and pass through the 
holding plate (8), and
 
the star-shaped punches (18) are arranged on the top 

plate (16) and pass through both the holding plates (8 
and 12). 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in 
that, in the open position (starting position) of the 

apparatus (2), the cutting edges of the knives (10 and 
14) and of the star-shaped punches (18) are situated in a 

plane between the holding plate (8), which is adjacent 
the die plate (6), and the die plate (6). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterised in that the die plate (6) and the 
bottom plate (4) are provided with discharge openings 

(56) for the rounding cut-outs cut out by the star-shaped 
punches (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and 6, characterised 
in that the stop (28) and/or the stop (26) for the knives 

(14) with concave cutting edges (32) and/or the knives 
(10) with straight cutting edges are/is adjustable such 

that the sheet may be scored up to a residual thickness 
of 0.03 mm to 0.05 mm, corresponding to the thickness of 

the thin film where tearing is desired. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the recess (32) of the 

cutting edge of the knives (14) has the shape of a 
trapezium, a rectangle or concave recess.
