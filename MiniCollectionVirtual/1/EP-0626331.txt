<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for exactly separating a main stack from an auxiliary stack in continuous deliveries of sheet-processing printing machines. The object on which the invention is based is to develop a solution which guarantees the exact separation of the main and auxiliary stacks and which prevents sheets from slipping back in the direction of the sheet ascent during the depositing operation. Furthermore, spearing actions caused by holding-up devices are to be avoided. This is achieved by means of a corresponding method and in that the carrier 22 and a crossbar 21 are articulated vertically movably, for example by means of cranks 14, on a crossmember 10 fastened to the sheet brake 9. Lower stops 12 and wedges 13 are arranged in the direction of the stack on the carrier 22, and mountings 17 for rear sheet holding-up devices 16 are provided on the side of the carrier 22 facing away from the stack. The sheet holding-up devices 16 pivot inwards in the stack region when a stack board 2 is pushed in.

Process for exact pile separation of main (1) and 
auxiliary (5) piles in non-stop deliveries of sheet 

operating printing presses using stops and sheet 
supporters for sheet front (4) and sheet rear edges 

(16), wherein, in the region of the pile rear edge, 
a cross-member (10) with fixed stops (11) is 

arranged on a format adjustable sheet brake device 
(9), characterised in that deposited final sheets of 

the upper layer of a main pile (1) are leafed 
through by means of sheet supports (16) swinging in 

on a cam path horizontally and vertically into the 
pile region at its sheet rear edge, until they 

arrive at the lowermost sheet of a newly-forming 
auxiliary pile (5) on a piling device (2) which has 

been pushed in and thereafter the lowermost as well 
as the subsequent sheets forming the auxiliary pile 

(5) are deposited on the sheet supports (16), with 
the sheet supports (16) moving to the level of the 

upper surface of the piling device. 
Device for exact pile separation of main and 
auxiliary piles in non-stop deliveries of sheet 

operating printing presses using stops and sheet 
supports for sheet front (4) and sheet rear edges 

(16) wherein in the region of the pile rear edge, a 
cross-member (10) with fixed stops (11) is arranged 

on a format adjustable sheet brake device (9) 
characterised in that on the fixed upper stops (11) 

are arranged lower stops (12) fixed to a vertically 
movable carrier (22) extending in the extended 

length below the pushing in plane for a piling 
device, e.g. a pile board (2), wherein the carrier 

(22) is coupled with actuation means which, on 
pushing in the pile device, e.g. the pile board (2), 

effect the vertical movement of the carrier (22) and  
 

on the side of the carrier (22) turned away from the 
pile region, mounting and guide means are arranged 

for horizontal and combined vertical swivelling in 
of sheet supports (16) into the pile region. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that 

on at least two fixed upper stops (11), lower 
stops (12) fixed to a carrier (22) are guided 

in parallel, wherein carrier (22) and a cross-member 
(21) arranged parallel are vertically 

movably linked by means of coupling members and 
links to the cross-member (10) carrying the 

stops (11), 
at the free ends of the carrier (22) are 
arranged wedges (13) extending into the pile 

region which are directed obliquely upwardly in 
the pushing in plane of the pile board (2), 
on the side of the carrier (22) turned away 
from the pile region, mountings (17) are 

arranged, in rotary pivots (18) of which, in 
each case, a lever (19) is mounted and at one 

end of the lever (19) a sheet supporter (16) is 
pivoted, as well as at the other end a roller 

(20) is arranged which stands in engagement 
with the transverse bar (21) which is 

constructed as a cam member, 
the vertically movable carrier (22) extends in 
its extended length below the pushing-in plane 

for the pile board (2). 
Device according to claims 2 and 3, characterised in 
that on at least two fixed upper stops (11), lower 

stops (12) are guided in parallel fixed on a carrier 
(22), wherein carrier (22) and a transverse bar (21) 

arranged in parallel are vertically movably linked 
by means of pivoted cranks (14) to the cross-member 

(10) carrying the stops (11).  
 
Device according to claims 2 and 3, characterised in 
that the pile board (2) is a brake which can be 

pushed in counter to the feed direction (23) and is 
retractable in the feed direction (23). 
Device according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the transverse bar (21) constructed as cam 

member has a cam groove in which the roller (20) is 
guided. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the cam groove on the transverse bar (21) is 

constructed with a crossing point so that the 
supports (16) swivel back in the region of the 

uppermost position out of the auxiliary pile (5).
