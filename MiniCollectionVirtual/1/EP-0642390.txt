<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for generating a spray of liquid comprises a nozzle (56) for receiving a flow of liquid and for forming the liquid into a jet, and means (eg. a hydrodynamic whistle 34, 52) for generating vibrations in the jet using energy obtained from the liquid, the vibrations being of at least one predetermined frequency such as to promote break-up of the jet into droplets.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING A LIQUID SPRAYThe invention relates to a method of and apparatus for the production of a liquid spray.The production of a finely-divided liquid spray, or "ato isation" is at the heart of many products and processes including aerosols, crop sprayers, fuel injection systems and painting. The majority of these applications employ a nozzle through which liquid is forced whereupon it breaks up into droplets which vary in size over a wide range.If the drop size can be controlled, significant advantages accrue. In aerosols, controlled drop size makes for uniform spray dispersion and coating. In agricultural spraying more regular drop size maximises the amount of liquid (be it insecticide, fungicide etc) reaching the targetted plants, whereas with an uncontrolled spray a large proportion of the liquid is dispersed by the wind through the drops being too small, or falls directly to the ground if the drops are too large. In fuel injectors, a more uniform spray offers the advantages of better, cleaner and more predictable combustion. In fire fighting, controlled drop size reduces the amount of water needed to put out a fire, by increasing the heat-absorbtion performance of the spray. Thus, in general, reducing the spread of drop sizes in a spray offers many benefits through an improved control of the spray properties. A few demanding applications such as ink jet printing require a very narrow spread of droplet sizes, termed "mono-dispersity".In a conventional spray nozzle, the emergent jet of liquid breaks up into droplets either as a result of the formation of capillary waves, or due to shear stresses resulting from aerodynamic drag. With capillary-induced growth the droplet diameter is directly related to the wave length. When many different wave lengths are present, as is the case in conventional nozzles, many different droplet sizes are produced. Typically, 90/. of the droplets lie in a region one decade wide say 10 to 100 microns.The capillary waves are initiated by liquid borne noise generated by the liquid flow eg. by turbulence, vortex-shedding etc. In conventional nozzles, this noise is produced over a wide range of random frequencies which causes the initiation of capillary waves of many 

different lengths. Those wave lengths close to an optimum value grow fastest with the result that the spread of droplet diameters is centred around the diameter corresponding to the optimum wave length.Drag induced break up is a higher-energy process than the capillary wave mode, and
