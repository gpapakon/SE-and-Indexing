<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
and an apparatus for determining a position of a mobile 
object, and a mobile communication system using the 
same. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a method of and an apparatus for detecting a position, 
moving speed and moving direction of a mobile 
object with high accuracy and a mobile radio communication 
system using the method. In a mobile communication system using a TDMA 
(Time Division Multiple Access) cellular process, a 
microcell mobile communication system planned to use 
frequencies effectively is studied. A basic zone 
arrangement used in the microcell mobile communication 
system includes the arrangement of a service zone by 
contiguous microcells each having a radius of about 50 
to several hundreds meters. Another idea has been 
proposed to form a service zone by very small cells 
called picocells which are smaller than the microcell. 
This system includes contiguous very small cells, each 
having a radius of about 10 - 50 meters set in offices 
in an underground street or a building where the  
 
propagation of radio waves is relatively difficult. 
Further, an idea of a so-called third generation mobile 
communication system has been proposed to unify both the 
techniques for those very small cells and the macrocells 
realized in a conventional mobile telephone system. One of the third generation systems includes a 
FPLMTS (Future Public Land Mobile Telecommunication 
Systems), the study of which has started internationally. 
The FPLMTS uses a variety of cell structures such 
as macrocells, microcells, and picocells arranged in a 
multilayered (or complex-cellular) structure in a 
service zone. Thus, high degree radio channel mobile 
control is indispensable which includes a control of 
zone switching between the respective cells, and 
allocation and switching of frequency bands among the 
respective cells. As the size of the cells becomes very 
small, problems are actualized which include an increase 
of the positional variation of the level of the receiving 
signal, an increase of the frequency in switching of 
the channel (frequency or time slot) during communication, 
and an increase of the installation cost of the 
base stations. Further problem is to counter with 
traffic concentration or jam and to provide flexible 
service for mobile objects moving at very high or very 
low speeds. Conventionally, in order to solve those 
problems, a study has been made of the decentralized 
autonomous control technique where

An apparatus according to claim 54, wherein 
each of said wide band transmission paths (52) comprises 

an optical fiber cable. 
A method of determining a position of a mobile 
object, comprising: 

   a first step (S201), which is carried out at 
 

each of a plurality of spaced positions disposed in an 
area where the mobile object is movable, of receiving a 

radio wave of a constant frequency transmitted from the 
mobile object, detecting a frequency of the received 

radio wave and detecting and storing a frequency 
deviation of the frequency of the receiving radio wave 

from the constant frequency; 
   repeating (S201) said first step at least two 

times at each of said positions; 
   a second step (S205), which is carried out at 

each of said positions, of obtaining difference data 
indicating a difference between the frequency deviation 

detected by the first step carried out at the first time 
and the frequency deviation detected by the first step 

carried out at the second time; 
   a third step (S206, 207, 208) of selecting at 

least two of said positions such that said difference 
data detected by the second step in each of said two 

positions satisfies a predetermined condition; and 
   a fourth step (S207, 208, 209) of determining 

the position of the mobile object based on position data 
indicating said at least two positions selected by said 

third step and said difference data obtained in said two 
positions. 
A method of determining a current position of 
a mobile object which has moved from a known position, 

said method comprising the steps of: 
   transmitting a radio wave of a constant 

 
frequency from the mobile object (step S7); 

   receiving the radio wave transmitted from said 
mobile object and detecting a frequency of the received 

radio wave at each of a plurality of spaced fixed 
positions in an area where said mobile object is movable 

(step S8); 
   determining a plurality of Doppler shift 

signals observed at the respective fixed positions, each 
Doppler shift signal indicative of a Doppler shift value 

dependent on a movement of the mobile object, on the 
basis of frequencies of the received radio wave detected 

at the fixed positions, respectively (steps S9, 10); 
   selecting at least two of said Doppler shift 

signals which satisfy a predetermined condition among 
the plurality of Doppler shift signals (steps S11, 12); 

and 
   determining the current position of said 

mobile object on the basis of position data indicating 
the fixed positions corresponding to said selected at 

least two Doppler signals (step S13). 
A method according to claim 57, wherein said 
selected at least two Doppler signals include maximum 

and minimum Doppler shift signals which provide maximum 
and minimum Doppler shift values, respectively, among 

upward or downward Doppler shift values given by said 
plurality of Doppler shift signals. 
A method according to claim 58, wherein the 
current position of said mobile object is determined by 

 
a position where first and second straight lines 

intersect with each other, wherein said first straight 
line passes a first one of the fixed positions 

corresponding to said maximum Doppler shift signal and 
extending toward said known position, while said second 

straight line passes a second one of the fixed positions 
corresponding to said minimum Doppler shift signal to 

extend toward said known position and intersects at a 
right angle with said first straight line.
