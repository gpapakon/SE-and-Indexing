<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to milk protein hydrolysates and their use to induce 
immunologic tolerance in infants suffering from cow's milk allergy. EPA 421 309 (Sandoz Nutrition Ltd.) discloses non-allergenic cow milk 
protein hydrolysates having a high degree of hydrolysis whilst having a low content 
of free amino acids. The non-allergenic milk protein hydrolysates disclosed in EPA 
421 309 are indicated for use as protein supply replacement in infants having 
intolerance against dietary proteins such as cow's milk proteins. The terms non-allergenic hydrolysates and hydrolysates substantially free of 
allergenic proteins as used herein are interchangeable. They refer to protein 
hydrolysates that can be administered to infants having intolerance against dietary 
proteins, more particularly cow's milk proteins, without inducing allergic reactions. In allergic disease, the type of allergy is related with the age to the child as 
food allergy mostly occur in infants. Cow's milk allergy is a common food allergy in 
infants, the disease prevalence ranging from 2 to 7,5 % of all children. Various 
symptoms can occur. Symptoms can be immediate (e.g. anaphylaxis and urticaria) 
which occur in half of the patients or less specific (e.g. vomiting or diarrhoea) which 
represent delayed clinical reactions in the other half of patients. Diagnostic 
procedure is well standardized with the criteria given by the European Society for 
Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition Working Group (ESPGAN J. Pediatr. 
Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1992; 14: 108-12). Complete exclusion of cow's milk proteins 
and diet with hydrolysed formulas represent the treatment of choice of this 
condition. Cow's milk allergy disappears spontaneously. Cow's milk tolerance tends 
to appear at 2 to 4 years of age, whereby it is been suggested for safety reasons 
to avoid administration of milk proteins to children suffering from cow's milk allergy 
before they are 6 to 7 years old.  It has now surprisingly been found that non-allergenic whey protein 
hydrolysates are capable of inducing cow's milk protein tolerance such that cow's 
milk allergy disappears substantially faster than normally would be expected for 
spontaneously (i.e. naturally) acquired tolerance. The invention accordingly provides a method of inducing cow's milk protein 
tolerance in children susceptible to cow's milk allergy by administering to a child in 
need of such treatment a whey protein hydrolysate substantially free of allergenic 
proteins. The whey protein hydrolysate free of
