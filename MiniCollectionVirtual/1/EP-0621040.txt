<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing the number of contaminative live bacteria in xanthan 
gum which comprises the step of washing a mixture of 100 parts by weight of 

water-containing isopropanol having an isopropanol concentration of 50 to 100% by 
weight and 1 to 100 parts by weight of the xanthan gum under heating conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for reducing the number of 
contaminative live bacteria in xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is an anionic polysaccharide produced by the submerged 
fermentation of a xanthan gum producing bacterium of the genus Xanthomonas. It is used 
in many industrial fields, including, foods, cosmetics, medicines and the like. In the 
conventional fermentation processes used for the preparation of xanthan gum, bacteria 
other than the xanthan-producing bacteria may grow which may survive the process and 
end up as live bacterial contaminants in the final xanthan product. In certain of these end uses, and in particular, in food, cosmetic, and 
medical products, it is preferable that the number of contaminative live bacteria in the 
xanthan gum decrease as much as possible. Preferably, the number of the bacteria is 
about 100 or less per gram of the xanthan gum. In conventional xanthan processing, after the fermentation is completed, an 
organic solvent in which xanthan is insoluble, typically, isopropanol, is used to precipitate 
the xanthan from the fermentation broth. Usually the amount of isopropanol used to 
precipitate the xanthan gum is 1 to 3 times by volume of the volume of the fermentation 
broth containing the xanthan gum. The precipitated xanthan gum is collected, dehydrated 
and then directly dried.  
 In certain procedures for the recovery of xanthan from fermentation broths, 
the broth may be subjected to a heating step before the precipitation procedure. See, for 
example, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication 2-60597 which relates to a method for 
enhancing the efficiency of filtration by sterilizing bacteria by heating after culturing and 
agglomerating the bacteria. The xanthan gum producing bacteria are killed by such a heat treatment or 
by contact with the isopropanol used to precipitate the gum. However, contaminative 
bacteria can get into the xanthan gum, for example, in a process line, subsequent to the 
addition of the isopropanol. Contaminative bacteria entering at this point are not killed by 
the isopropanol present or the heat treatment and end up in the xanthan product as live 
bacterial contaminant. Sterilization methods for the reduction of the number of contaminative 
bacteria in the xanthan gum have been suggested. Such sterilization methods include 
those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,206,275 wherein a method for the sterilization of 
materials, such as, tobacco, spices, rice and the like, by subjecting them to repeated gas 
treatments, is

<CLAIMS>
A method for reducing the number of contaminative live 
bacteria in xanthan gum which comprises the step of 

washing 1 to 100 parts by weight 
of particulate xanthan gum, the particle diameter thereof 

being such that at least 90% possess a mesh of 105 µm with 100 parts by weight of water-containing 
isopropanol having an isopropanol concentration 

of 60 to 95% by weight, 
while heating the mixture of xanthan gum and water-containing isopropanol at a temperature of from 

50° to 80°C for a heating time of one hour to less 
than 5 hours. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein said mixture is 
contacted at a pressure from atmospheric to about 0,15 

MPa. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the xanthan gum product 
has a contaminative bacterial content of no more than 

100 per gram of xanthan gum.
