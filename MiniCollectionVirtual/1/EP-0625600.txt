<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus contains a continuous yarn channel (13, 14, 15) of circular cross-section. Three blowing-medium feed bores (16, 17) open out in a cylindrical middle portion (14) of the yarn channel (13, 14, 15). The axes of the blowing-medium feed bores (16, 17) intersect the axis of the yarn channel (13, 14, 15) at a common point, each at an angle of 15 to 40@. By means of the apparatus, it is possible to treat a multifilament yarn (M1), which is fed to the yarn channel (13, 14, 15) with an over-delivery of 0 to 15 % and which is drawn off from the apparatus transversely to the axis of the yarn channel (13, 14, 15), in such a way that the filaments of the yarn are intertwisted with one another uniformly over the length of the yarn and, at the same time, form no projecting loops.

Method for the compressed air interlacing of one or more 
filament yarns in a yarn duct into which compressed air is 

blown laterally, characterised in that the filament yarn is 
supplied to an interlacing apparatus with overfeed of less 

than 15%, the compressed air is introduced via orifices in a 
cylindrical central portion at an angle of 15 to 40° to the 

axis of the yarn duct, the filaments are braided uniformly 
with one another and are taken off at right angles at the 

outlet of a yarn duct widened in the form of a trumpet as 
knot-free interlaced yarn comprising no projecting filament 

loops. 
Interlacing apparatus for producing a knot-free 
interlaced yarn having no projecting filament loops, in 

particular according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
interlacing apparatus comprises a yarn duct which is circular 

in cross section with a cylindrical central portion and then a 
portion with an outlet widening in the form of a trumpet, 

three orifices for the compressed air preferably being 
arranged at an angle of 15 to 40° to the axis of the yarn duct 

in such a way that they intersect a common point on the axis. 
Interlacing apparatus according to claim 2, for treating 
at l
east one running multifilament yarn with a blowing medium, 
with a continuous yarn duct (13, 14, 15) which is circular in 

cross section and comprises a cylindrical central portion (14) 
in which a number of blowing medium supply, orifices (16, 17, 

18) open laterally, wherein the numbers of blowing medium 
supply orifices (16, 17, 18) is three and these orifices are 

arranged at regular angular intervals from one another such 
that their axes intersect the axis of the yarn duct (13, 14, 

15) at a common point at a respective angle of 15 to 40°.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
axes of the blowing medium supply orifices (16, 17, 18) 

intersect the axis of the yarn duct (13, 14, 15) at a 
respective angle of 25 to 35°, preferably 30°. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the yarn duct (13, 14, 15) has a conically tapering inlet 

portion (13) before the cylindrical central portion (14). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the cylindrical central portion (14) of 

the yarn duct (13, 14, 15) has a diameter of 1 to 2 mm, 
preferably a diameter of 1.1 to 1.3 mm. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the three blowing medium supply orifices 

(16, 17, 18) have a diameter in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 mm, 
preferably have a diameter of 0.55 to 0.65 mm. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by a body (11, 12) consisting of two parts which 

are displaceable with respect to one another between an 
operating position and a threading position and which have a 

respective recess in lateral faces turned toward one another 
such that the two recesses together define the yarn duct (13, 

14, 15) in the operating position while at least one of the 
recesses is exposed for insertion of the multifilament yarn in 

the threading position.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
two parts (11, 12) of the body are arranged in a mounting (23) 

containing a blowing medium supply duct (24) and in that one 
part (12) is displaceable in the mounting (23) and has a 

blowing mediums inlet aperture (19) which communicates with the 
blowing medium supply orifices (16, 17, 18) and is aligned 

with the mouth of the blowing medium supply duct (24) in the 
mounting (23) in the operating position while this mouth is 

closed by said part (12) of the body in the threading 
position.
