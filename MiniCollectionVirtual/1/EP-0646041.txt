<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reverse osmosis water
treatment and storage system. More particularly, it
relates to an integrated reverse osmosis water treatment
and storage system for use in supplying drinking water. A
reverse osmosis system for supplying drinking water from a
raw water source usually includes a prefilter, a reverse
osmosis membrane, a post filter, and a means for storing
the product or processed water.Reverse osmosis water processing systems are used to
provide purified water for human consumption. Such systems
customarily included four separate components, a
prefilter, a reverse osmosis filter, a post filter and a
storage tank for the product or processed water. With each
of these components being provided as a separate unit, a
complete system occupies a considerable amount of space.
It is frequently desirable to install a reverse osmosis
water processing system within the cabinet space under a
sink. If a system is installed under a sink, a
considerable amount of space which might otherwise be used
for storage is lost. Further, when each system component
is provided as a separate unit, the installation of the
water processing system is quite labor intensive.US 3 679 055 discloses a reverse osmosis water
purifier. It consists of a tank containing a tubular
housing, inside of which is a reverse osmosis element. A
flexible bladder surrounds the tubular housing within the 
tank.US 5 078 876 discloses an apparatus for multistage
purification of water. It consists of a pressure vessel
containing within it multiple concentric purification
mediums.US 3 719 593 discloses a water purifying device. It
consists of a reverse osmosis water purifying element
housed in a pressure vessel surrounded by cylindrical
membrane functioning as a process water reservoir. All
components reside in an outer cylindrical shell or
housing. As the population becomes more and more concerned
about the quality of water, particularly that used for
cooking and drinking, the installation of reverse osmosis
systems at the point of use to provide purified water has
become more frequent. As the demand for such units
increases, so does the desirability of simplifying not
only the reverse osmosis assembly, itself, but also the
labor involved in installing the system.Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to
provide an integrated reverse osmosis water processing and
storage system. It is a further object of this invention
to provide a reverse osmosis water processing and storage
system consisting of a prefilter, reverse

<CLAIMS>
A reverse osmosis system comprising:

a pressure tank (12) having an open end (14),
an expandable bladder (16) received within said
pressure tank (12), said bladder (16) having an open end,
a second tank assembly, including a second tank (18)
received within said bladder (16), said second tank (18)

having a first and second end, the first end being open,
said second tank (18) having a first flange (94)
located on the outside of and near the open end of the

second tank (18) for securing the bladder (16) and the second tank (18) in the open end (14) of the pressure tank (12), and a second flange (42) located on the
outside of and at the open end of the second tank (18),
said open end of said bladder (16) being engaged
between the open end (14) of the pressure tank (12) and

said first flange (94) to provide a first seal between
said pressure tank (12) and said bladder (16), so as to

form a first enclosed variable volume (114) between said
pressure tank (12) and said bladder (16), and a second

seal between said bladder (16) and said second tank (18),
so as to form a second enclosed variable volume (86)

between said bladder and said second tank (18),
said first flange (94) secured to said pressure tank
(12) by a clamp (98),
a cylindrical reverse osmosis membrane assembly (22)
received within said second tank (18),
a hollow cylindrical prefilter (20) having end caps 
(24, 26), and surrounding the cylindrical reverse osmosis

membrane assembly (22),
said second tank assembly including a cap (38) for
closing said first end of said second tank (18), said cap

having a flange (40) located on the outside of said cap
(38),
said flange (40) on said cap (38) secured to said
second flange (42) on said tank (18) by two clamps (44,

46) and two clips (48, 50),
a check valve (36) located at said second end of the
second tank (18), said check valve (36) allowing water

flow out of said second tank (18) and preventing flow into
said second tank (18),
a first (56) and second (34) concentric cylindrical
wall on the bottom of said second tank (18) and a third

concentric cylindrical wall (58) on said cap (38), for
supporting said hollow prefilter (20) and said reverse

osmosis membrane assembly (22) in said second tank (18)
such that, in use, raw water which enters said second

tank (18) must first flow through said hollow prefilter
(20) and then through said reverse osmosis assembly (22), and purified product water flows from said assembly (22) through

said check valve (36) into said second variable volume (86),
said first concentric cylindrical wall (56) makes a
