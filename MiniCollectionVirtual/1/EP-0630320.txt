<ABSTRACT>
Described is an adhesive for bonding together, under the action of heat, the surfaces of two layers of material, in particular by bonding points on the surfaces. The adhesive comprises pieces of thermoplastic sheet (1, 2, 3, 4) which are applied to the contact surface of at least one of the layers (5, 7).

Adhesive for connecting two layers of material over an area, in particular
at points, under the action of heat, characterised in that the adhesive is formed

by pieces of thermoplastic plastics film (1,2,3,4) of different sizes and thickness
capable of being applied to the contact surface of at least one layer of material

(5,7), the pieces of plastics film (1,2,3,4) having a size between 0,5 and 15 mm
in breadth and length.
Adhesive according to claim 1, characterised in that the pieces of plastics
film (1,2,3,4) comprise different materials.
Adhesive according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the pieces of
plastic film (1,2,3,4) have a size between 1 and 5 mm.
Adhesive according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that
the pieces of plastic film (1,2,3,4) originate from scrap film or waste material.
Adhesive according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that
the adhesive connection is releasable by the action of heat.
The use of the adhesive according to one of the foregoing claims, for
connecting together two layers of material, characterised in that pieces of

plastics film are deposited on a layer of material (5,7) in any desired spatial
arrangement and bonded to the two layers of material (5,7) under the action of

pressure and heat. 
The use according to claim 6, characterised in that the bonding is achieved
by hot-pressing.
The use according to one of claims 6 or 7 characterised in that the
bonding together of the layers of material (5,7) takes place over the entire

contact area either over the full area or partial area.
The use according to one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the
bonding is point by point.
The use according to one of claims 6 to 9, characterised in that the layers
of material to be bonded together are parts of three-dimensional bodies.
The use according to one of claims 6 to 10 characterised in that the three-dimensional
bodies are bonded together in a process resulting in shaped bodies,

e.g. a deep-drawing process or a heat-forming process.
The use of the adhesive according to one of claims 1 to 5 for the
production of a double-sided material adhesive coating, in which pieces of

plastics film (9) are arranged on one side of a permeable carrier material (8) and
are bonded to it under the action of pressure and heat in such a way that the

pieces of plastics film (9) are forced through the meshes of the permeable carrier
(8).
The use according to claim 12, characterised in that the carrier material
(8) is a fleece material. 
The use of the adhesive according to one of claims 1 to 5 for producing a
material adhesive coating in which pieces of plastic film are arranged on a

silicone paper and bonded to it by the action of heat.
The use of the material adhesive coating according to claim 12 for the
bonding together of two layers of material (10,11) either over an area or three-dimensionally.
The use of the adhesive according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the adhesive serves for bonding together, or to other layers of material,

layers of material (5,7) comprising paper, leather, textile material such as
fabrics, metal films or cardboard.
The use of the adhesive according to one of claims 1 to 5 for producing a
material adhesive coating (5) which has at least on one side a contact face to

which pieces of plastics film (6) are stuck by the action of heat.
The use according to claim 17, characterised in that pieces of film (6) of
different materials are arranged side by side.
The use according to claim 18, characterised in that the pieces of plastics
film are coated at points with a material which reduces the adhesive capac
ity.
