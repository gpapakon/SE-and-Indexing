<ABSTRACT>
A recording sheet comprising a substrate and a 
colorant absorbing layer made of a porous inorganic 

oxide, formed on the substrate, wherein said colorant 
absorbing layer contains an organic acid with the first 

acid dissociation exponent of at most 5, which has an 
aromatic nucleus or at least two carboxyl groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording sheet
and a record.JP-A-4-263983 discloses a recording sheet having a die holding layer comprising
pseudo-boehmite on a substrate wherein a surfactant is applied on the surface of the
pseudo-boehmite to prevent bleeding. As the surfactant, "dodecyl benzenesulfonic
acid" is illustrated.US-A-4,562,448 discloses a heat-sensitive paper comprising an ink-receiving layer
which consists essentially of salicylic acid as a developer. The developer is present
in the ink-receiving layer in an amount of from 8.3 to 90 wt.-%.EP-A-410 051 discloses a printing sheet which employs cinnamic acid for improving
an adhesiveness of a UV curing ink.It has been common to form images by means of various
printers of e.g. an ink jet system, an electrophotography
system or a dye diffusion thermal transfer system. In
such cases, with ordinary paper, no adequate ink
absorption or image resolution can be obtained, and it is
difficult to obtain a transparent sheet. Therefore, a
recording sheet having an inorganic porous layer formed 
on a substrate has, for example, been proposed as in e.g.
US Patent 5,104,730.With such a recording sheet having a porous layer
excellent in ink absorption and in fixing of
colorants, it has been likely that during storage,
the porous layer absorbs also plasticizers for the resin
and thus undergoes a color change. It is an object of
the present invention to provide a recording sheet
excellent in ink absorption as well as in fixing 
of colorants, which undergoes no color change even when
stored for a long period of time.The present invention provides a recording sheet
for an ink jet printer comprising a substrate and a colorant absorbing layer
which has a structure having porous inorganic oxide particles bonded by
a binder which is present in an amount of from 5 to 50 wt% based on the
porous inorganic oxides formed on the substrate, wherein said colorant
absorbing layer contains an organic acid with the first acid dissociation
exponent of at most 5,
in an amount of from 0.05 to 7.5 weight per cent, based on the weight of the
colorant-absorbing layer,
which has an aromatic nucleus
bonded to a carboxyl group
or at least two
carboxyl groups.Here, the organic acid with the first acid
dissociation exponent of at most 5 includes not only
polybasic acids but also monobasic acids. In the present
invention, such an organic acid is incorporated in the
colorant absorbing layer, whereby color change of the
recording sheet can be prevented. If the first acid
