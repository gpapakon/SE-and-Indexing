<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for splitting up the consumption, in particular with respect to the heating costs and hot-water costs. The installation is equipped for central acquisition, the individual measurement points 1, which automatically measure the consumption of the consumers monitored by them, sporadically transmitting the consumption values, measured by them in the meantime, to an external central station which carries out the evaluation and issues the consumer bills. This is done without wires by radio contact, using frequencies licensed by telecom. For this purpose, the external central station is assigned a suitable radio receiver. The data emission at the measuring points 1 (consumption distributors) is triggered by a random generator assigned to each device, which initiates the data emission after certain time intervals in accordance with a statistical probability, which is then repeated directly a number of times by the electronic system of the consumption distributor so as to avoid possible disturbing influences on the data transmission. Together with the measured consumption values, during the data emission all the other characteristic data necessary to define the measuring point unambiguously are simultaneously transmitted during the radio transmission.

Device for central recording of energy consumption costs
for a multiplicity of consumer points, for example

heating and hot water costs in residential and/or
business premises, with an electronic consumption

distribution device (1) which is allocated to each
consumer point and produces, totals and electronically

stores a relative or absolute consumption value at the
measurement point concerned, with a transmitter (15)

emitting electromagnetic waves for the coded

determined by a timer (20) by means of a random
generator (16, 18), of the stored consumption value in a

sequential pulse sequence, and with a common central
receiving point (30, 31, 32) with a receiver selecting

successi
on.
