<ABSTRACT>
An electric discharge lamp has a discharge vessel (11) including pair of 
opposing planar seals (14) each having a pair of major faces (14a, b) and a pair of 

minor side faces (14c, d). A containment shield surrounds the discharge vessel (11) and 
includes a glass sleeve (21) and a helically coiled wire (22) secured on the glass sleeve. 

The glass sleeve is pinched to ends of the minor side faces (14c, d) of the seals (14) 
only and substantially does not engage the major faces (14a, b) of the seal. The wire 

(22) is fixed around the sleeve (21) in an electrically floating manner, e.g. by clamping 
fit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high pressure discharge lamp comprising: 
an outer envelope; a discharge vessel arranged within the outer envelope, the discharge vessel 
including a body portion enclosing a discharge space, a pair of opposing electrodes 
within said body portion between which a discharge is maintained during lamp 
operation, and a pair of opposing seals sealing the discharge vessel in a gas-tight 
manner, each of the seals having a pair of opposing major faces and a pair of minor 
side faces extending between the major faces; frame means for supporting the discharge vessel within the outer envelope 
and for electrically connecting the discharge vessel to a source of electric potential 
outside of the lamp envelope; and a light-transmissive sleeve disposed about the discharge vessel and having 
an end pinched to a said seal. Such a lamp has been publicly disclosed by Venture Lighting Company of 
Cleveland, Ohio as a metal halide lamp in 70 W and 100 W sizes. The sleeve and 
discharge vessel for this lamp are shown in Figure 1. The purpose of the containment sleeve 1 is to contain fragments of the 
discharge vessel 2 and prevent failure of the outer envelope (not shown) in the rare 
event of discharge vessel rupture. One end 3 of the sleeve is open while the other end 4 
is pinched to both major faces of one of the press seals 5. The discharge vessel is of the 
formed body type in which the body portion 6 of the discharge vessel, which lies 
between the press seals and in which the discharge is maintained between discharge 
electrodes 7, has a precise elliptical or ovoidal shape. The fusing of the sleeve to a portion of the discharge vessel is 
advantageous because lamp manufacturing is simple and no additional metal parts are 
introduced into the lamp envelope. However, the containment was found to be 
insufficient. The wall thickness of the sleeve in the lamp of Figure 1 was 2 mm. In tests  
 
in which the discharge vessel was ruptured by a current surge, failure of the outer 
envelope was found to occur. Additionally, the sleeve construction is asymmetric in that 
the pinched end of the sleeve is totally closed whereas the other side is open. The lower 
side of the discharge vessel will thus have a significantly different temperature, and the 
lamp will have different photometrics, depending on whether the lamp orientation is 
base-up or base-down, which is undesirable. Also from EP 0.549.056-A1 a discharge lamp is known, in which a sleeve 
is held around the discharge vessel by means of
