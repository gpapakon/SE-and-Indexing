<ABSTRACT>
A unitized wheel hub (12) and bearing assembly for use 
on the ends of stationary axles and particularly on 

tractor and trailer axles. A wheel hub (12), a pair of 
bearings (14,16) and at least one seal are assembled with a 

mounting sleeve (22) which is sized to be fitted on an axle 
end (40). The inclusion of a custom designed mounting 

sleeve (22) permits the building of unitized assemblies to 
be used with existing axles as well as with new ones. 

The unitized construction allows pre-adjustment of the 
bearings and when two seals are employed, the bearings 

can also be pre-lubricated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unitized wheel hub and 
bearing assembly for mounting on the ends of vehicle 
axles. More particularly, the assembly includes a 
special unitary mounting sleeve, a pair of bearings, at 
least one seal and a wheel hub. By means of the 
assembly the various elements may be pre-adjusted and, 
when two seals are used, may be pre-lubricated. In wheeled vehicles of all types, it is necessary 
to provide bearings for axles so that associated wheel 
hubs may rotate freely on the end of a relatively 
stationary axle. Such bearings must be lubricated and 
seals are required to retain the lubricating medium 
whether it be grease or oil. Frequently, wear sleeves 
are employed to prevent undue wear of the axle by the 
seals. Sometimes such wear sleeves have been separate 
elements and sometimes they have been an integral part 
of a unitized seal. Until quite recently, such bearing, seal and wheel 
hub means have been assembled piece by piece. The 
bearing races have been fitted to designated axle 
portions and corresponding portions of the associated 
wheel hub. The bearing elements are usually spaced as  
 
far apart axially as possible with a tapered axle 
portion between the elements. The assembly also 
includes one or two seals, depending upon the 
particular design. These wheel hub assemblies have 
typically provided long lasting performance when 
assembled properly. However, such an assembly process 
requires skilled personnel and proper equipment to 
achieve proper installation and operation. If repair 
or replacement of any part becomes necessary, correct 
positioning and adjustment of all elements becomes even 
more of a challenge and damaged parts are a quite 
likely result. Typical prior art assemblies are 
illustrated in U.S. patent 4,552,367 assigned to 
Garlock Inc and patent 4,037,849 assigned to The 
Mechanex Corp. More recently, some efforts have been made to 
develop assemblies which permit more of the various 
elements to be pre-assembled and adjusted, thus 
resulting in less dependance on the skills of the field 
mechanic. One such attempt has been the SAF Euro-axle 
developed by Otto Sauer Achsenfabric of Keilberg, 
Germany. These units accomplish much in terms of 
allowing factory assembly and adjustment of sealed 
bearing units and avoidance of so much dependance on 
the skills of the field mechanic. However, these units 
are not constructed to allow prefilling with oil which 
is a preferred bearing lubricant as compared to grease.
