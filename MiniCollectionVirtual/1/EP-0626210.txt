<CLAIMS>
Device for dispensing a dose of given volume of 
a liquid or pasty product, including a receptacle (2, 

102) capable of containing several doses of product, a 
bottle (3, 103) capable of containing a single dose of 

product, a means for transferring the product from the 
receptacle (2, 102) into the bottle (3, 103), and a 

means for dispensing the dose of product from the bottle 
(3, 103), it being possible for the bottle (3, 103) to be 

fixed removably to the receptacle (2, 102) and to slide 
longitudinally with respect to the said receptacle (2, 

102), characterized in that: 

the receptacle (2, 102) is equipped with a first 
pump (4, 104) including a hollow control rod (5, 

105) for transferring, by forcing, the product from 
the receptacle (2, 102) into the bottle (3, 103); 
the bottle (3, 103) is equipped at one end with a 
second pump (15, 115) and with a dispensing head 

(14, 114) for dispensing the dose of product from 
the bottle (3, 103), the said bottle having, at the 

other end, a bottom (17, 117) designed to interact 
with the end of the control rod (25, 125) of the 

first pump (4, 104) and including a valve sealing 
off a passage (26) for communication between the 

receptacle (2, 102) and the bottle (3, 103) formed 
in the said bottom (17, 117), and opening only under 

the pressure of the product contained in the receptacle 
(2, 102) when the first pump (4, 104) is 

actuated. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first pump (4, 104) is carried by a component 

(8, 108) forming a plug including a skirt (9) for fixing 
on to the receptacle, the component being closed by a 

wall (12) perpendicular to the said skirt and equipped 
with an opening (13). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the component forming a plug is secured to a guide 

component (133, 333) for guiding the sliding of the 
bottle (103).  

 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the bottom (17, 117) of the bottle is a 

separate component. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the valve located in the bottom of the 

bottle includes a moving body (28, 128) resting on a seat 
(27, 127), the moving body (28, 128) being held by an 

elastic means (29, 129). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the moving body is a ball (28, 128). 
Device according to one of Claims 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the elastic means is a strip (29). 
Device according to one of Claims 5 or 6, characterized 
in that the elastic means is a spring (129). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the outer face of the bottom (17, 117) of 

the bottle is provided with an indentation (24, 124) into 
which there opens a passage which can be sealed off by 

the valve and in that the end of the hollow control rod 
(25, 125) of the first pum
p (4, 104) has a complementary 
shape to that of the said indentation (24, 124). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the bottle (3, 103) is equipped with 

vents (30, 130) close to the dispensing head (14, 114). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the bottle (103) contains a free 

piston (136). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the bottle contains, close to the dispensing head 

(114), a spring (139) located so that the free piston 
(136) compresses it at the end of travel. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the bottle (403) has a swelling 

(403
a
) close to the dispensing head (414).
