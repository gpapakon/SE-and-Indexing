<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the integral treatment of chromium containing wastes from tan-yards according to the diagram of figure (1). There 
is provided one or two solid (1) and/or liquid (2) effluents which contain chromium. The solid effluent is subjected to a treatment (4) with perborate (3) producing 

a chromium-free residue (5) which is treated by conventional methods (for example hydrolysis in order to produce gums or chelagen) and waters which contain 
the chromium present as Cr(VI). Said Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(III) by redution in acid medium at (6). In a reactor (7) the solution containing Cr(III) is treated 

continuously with an alkaline solution (8), to give waters with less than 1 ppm of Cr(9) and a pulp (10) containing Cr(OH)₃.3H₂O from which is obtained, by 
acidification with sulphuric acid, a concentrated solution of chromium sulphate reusable in the same tan-yard. The present invention provides for the precipitation 

of Cr(III) contained in solutions, by using magnesium hydroxide (or mixture with NaOH); the chromium-containing solution is slowly and continuously added 
to another solution, maintained at a temperature between 60 and 63ºC, to which is also added the neutralizing agent. Thereby, the precipitate obtained has particular 

characteristics of solubility and settling which cannot be obtained in a precipitate produced with other neutralizers. In the solid wastes, the oxidation is performed 
by stirring these chopped wastes with an aqueous solution which contains a perborate in the proportion of at least 1.5 mol of BO₃ per at-g of Cr contained in the 

residues (for example 2.35 g of NaBO₃ per g of Cr), during a period of time longer than 10 minutes, the recommended amount of perborate to be used, if sodic 
salt is used, being from 3.3 to 3.7 g of NaBO₃ per g of Cr contained in the residue to be treated and the recommeded treatment time being 45 minutes. The perborate 

may be substituted by a mixture of oxygenated water, H₂O₂, and a borate (for example borax) in a solution whose pH must be comprised between 7.5 and 11.5, 
preferably between 8.5 and 9.5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The tanning industry is considered as the cause of a considerable amount of pollution
due to both its solid and liquid waste; a typical percentage distribution of the different
effluents might be the following:
Purifying plant sludges35.0%Fats30.0%Cutoff chippings or waste10.0%Fleshing and gristle8.1%Shavings6.0%Trash (wood, plastics, etc.)10.9%Regarding solid waste, the partial percentages for different by-products
varies widely
according to the type of manufacturing (ovine, capric, bovine, etc.). As in the above case,
and referring to the production of medium-fine skins (lamb), the following percentage
distribution may be found:
Fleshed and dry skin (for tanning)23%Clean and dry wool (saleable)20%Rough skin cuttings17%Proteins dispersed in drainage water15%Insoluble matter25%Cuttings have the following distribution:
Collagen27%Wool32%Fatty matter15%Others26%Proteins and insoluble matter are dumped into the sewage water from the tanning
industry; insoluble matter (made up of fats, collagenic proteins and suety keratinics) and are
in suspension in this water. The global DQO for these drainage waters is 2 500 ppm with
a pH of 8.The amount of water required (and therefore dumped) by the said industry is about
30 m3/day.The above problems worsen due to the almost generalised presence of chromium in
cutoffs and shavings (coming from the tanning).It is well known that in the last few years the tanning industries have been
increasingly required to start with skins in a "wet-blue" state that generates greater quantities
of this solid waste, composed 90% of proteins and 5 to 6% of chromium oxide.With regard to the chromium content in the water, it is known that Cr(VI) is 100
times more toxic for mammals than Cr(III). It has been proved that at this valency,
chromium is essential for many of the functions of the organism (it increases the action of
insulin and retards arteriosclerosis) and its daily requirement is 62 µg/L, a larger amount
than the average of 15 µg/L found during analyses of water. In any event, the content of
Cr(III) in drainage water must be less than 2 mg/L.At this time Cr(VI) which previously was widely used in two bath tanning, has
practically disappeared from tan-yards. On the other hand, Cr(III) is currently the most
important tanning agent and attempts to find a substitute for it have been without success. 
This means that chromium with this valency appears in important concentrations in tanning
bath waste. Furthermore, the washing of wet-blues gives rise to the appearance of some 30

Treatment of solid and liquid effluents from
tan-yards for removing and recovering the contained

chromium, characterized in that the treatment comprises
the following steps:


in a first step applicable to solid residues, the
chromium is solubilized by attack with a solution of

perborate in an alkaline medium, giving rise to a
chromium free residue and waters which contain chromium

as Cr(VI), whereafter said chromium Cr(VI) is reduced to
Cr(III) by reduction in acid medium, whereby a solution

containing Cr(III) is obtained;
in a second step, applicable to the solution
containing Cr(III) obtained in the first step and to

other liquid effluent solutions containing Cr(III), the
chromium containing solution is added slowly and

continuously to another solution in an agitator reactor,
initially filled with water, which is held at a

temperature above 55°C, to which is also continuously
added magnesium hydroxide or magnesium oxide, whereby the

chromium is precipitated in the form of hydroxide;

the addition of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium
oxide is regulated by the measurement of the pH in the

first reactor; the pH must not be less than 6;
