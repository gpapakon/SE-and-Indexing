<ABSTRACT>
A peptide linkage unit is employed for joining peptide and pseudopeptide sequences, including peptides and pseudopeptides that inhibit aspartic proteinase enzymes. The peptide linkage unit includes a phosphinate methylene ammonium linkage in place of a peptidyl carboxamide bond. If the peptide linkage unit is incorporated into a peptide sequence that would otherwise serve as an aspartic proteinase substrate and if it is positioned at a cleavage site within such peptide sequence, the phosphinate methylene ammonium linkage is resistant to cleavage and serves as an exploding transition state analog of such cleavage site. When so incorporated, the phosphinate methylene ammonium linkage can bind or interfere with the active site of aspartic proteinase enzymes and inhibit its activity. Preferred inhibitors contain a phosphinic acid methylene amine group joining the P1 and P1' residues and have a length of 3 to about 15 amino acid residues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to linkage units
for joining peptide sequences and to the use of such
linkage units for forming peptides and
pseudopeptides, including pseudopeptides that inhibit
aspartic proteinase enzymes. More particularly, the
invention relates to pseudopeptides that include a
phosphinate methylene ammonium linkage (exploding
transition state analog) in place of an amide bond at
the position in a peptide sequence that is cleaved by
aspartic proteinase enzymes.Peptide linkage units are employed in the
construction of peptides. In the simplest case,
naturally occurring L-amino acids serve as peptide
linkage units. However, various unnatural L-amino
acids and a wide variety of D-amino acids may also
serve as peptide linkage units. The peptide linkage
unit need not employ a peptide bond to form the
linkage. A number of pseudopeptides are disclosed
and employed in the prior art as peptide linkage
units.A peptide linkage unit may be employed to link
two peptide sequences or may be employed at the
terminal end of a peptide. The peptides lying on
either side of a peptide linkage unit may be
functionally distinct.Peptide linkage units are employed in the
construction of synthetic proteinase inhibitors.
Many proteinase substrates include a proteinase
binding or recognition region which flanks either
side of the cleavage site. Accordingly, one class of
synthetic proteinase inhibitor employs peptides 
having amino acid sequence homology with the binding
or recognition regions of known proteinase
substrates. If two such peptides are employed in a
synthetic proteinase inhibitor, i.e. peptides having
a sequence homology with the binding or recognition
region flanking either side of a cleavage site, a
peptide linkage unit may then be employed to link the
two peptides together. In this instance, the peptide
linkage unit will be positioned at or near the
cleavage site. Peptide linkage units which are
resistant to proteolysis and which bind tightly to
the active site of the proteinase are particularly
useful in the construction of synthetic proteinase
inhibitors.Aspartic proteinase enzymes (EC 3.4.23) are a
family of related enzymes that cleave (hydrolyze)
protein and polypeptide chains. These enzymes have
isoelectric points on the acid side of neutrality and
molecule masses ranging from 35,000-45,000 Daltons
(D) for fungal enzymes and about 35,500 D for pepsin.Exemplary enzymes of this class include pepsin
that is a mammalian gastric proteinase, cathepsin D
that is the intracellular aspartic proteinase
