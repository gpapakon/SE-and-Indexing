<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an agricultural machine, particularly a fodder windrower, including a structure (1) bearing at least one raking wheel (2) and a protective device (16) which includes at least one foldable lateral part (19, 20) to which is connected a catch (31) used to immobilise the raker wheel (2) during transport. It is noteworthy in that the raker wheel (2) has a stop piece (34) which blocks the catch (31) and the lateral part or parts (19 and 20) of the protective device (16) in the working position while it is being rotationally driven.

Agricultural machine especially a fodder windrower, comprising a structure
carrying at least one raking wheel which is driven in rotation during work

about a substantially vertical axis, and a protecting device which partially or
completely surrounds the said raking wheel, which protecting device has at

least one foldable lateral part to which is attached a bolt which immobilizes
the raking wheel during transport, 
characterized in
 that the raking wheel (2)
has a stop (34) that locks the bolt (31) and the lateral part or parts (19 and

20) of the protecting device (16) in the work position while this wheel is
driven in rotation.
Machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the stop (34) consists of
a ring (35) which is rigidly fastened to the raking wheel (2) and is located

beneath the bolt (31).
Machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the ring (35) has holes
(36) in which the bolt (31) can en
gage and the diameter of which is only
slightly greater than that of the said bolt (31).
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that
the bolt (31) consists of a substantially vertical pin (32).
Machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the bolt (31) is housed
in a tube (33) which is rigidly fastened to a bar (18) fixed to the structure (1).
Machine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
 that the bolt (31) is
connected to a cross member (39) which extends between the lateral parts

(19 and 20) of the protecting device (16) and can be moved heightwise by
means of this cross member (39). 
Machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in
 that the cross member (39)
is fixed at its ends to pivots (41 and 42) which are located on lugs (43 and

44) which are rigidly fastened to the axes of articulation (21 and 22) of the
lateral parts (19 and 20) of the protecting device (16).
Machine according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
 that the pivots (41 and 42)
are offset with respect to the axes of articulation (21 and 22) of the lateral

parts (19 and 20) of the protecting device (16).
Machine according to Claim 8, 
characterized in
 that the pivots (41 and 42)
lie on straight lines (D and D') which are directed obliquely upwards and

towards the middle of the machine when the lateral parts (19 and 20) of the
protecting device (16) are in the work position.
Machine according to Claim 9, 
characterized in
 that when the lateral parts
(19 and 20) of the protecting device (16) are in the work position, the straight

lines (D and D') form angles (α and α') of approximately 45° with a
horizontal line (L) passing through the axes of articulation (21 and 22) of the

the said lateral parts (19 and 20).
Machine according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
 that the cross member (39)
has at its ends, holes (45 and 46) which are oblong in the horizontal direction

and in which the pivots (41 and 42) are housed.
