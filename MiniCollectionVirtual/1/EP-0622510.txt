<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a hinge fitting for a window or door shutter, which is composed of a shutter hinge with a hinge sleeve into which there engages a hinge pin, fastened on the window or door frame or in the wall by means of a rod, and of a hinge-side stopping and/or locking unit with a latching attachment which takes effect between rod and shutter hinge and is intended for fixing the pivoting range of the shutter. The stopping and/or locking unit is mounted on the rod such that it can pivot about the hinge pin thereof, and it can be fixed in various positions with respect to the rod by fixing elements.

Hinge fitting for a window or door shutter fixable in the open position
via a shutter holder and comprising a shutter hinge member

(19) with a hinge sleeve (19') into which a hinge spigot (2) securable
by means of a bar member (1) to the window frame or door frame, or

in the wall, and also a hinge side abutment and/or locking unit (3)
mounted on the bar member (1) and pivotable around its hinge

spigot (2) and having a latch projection (4) effective between the bar
member (1) and the shutter hinge member (19) to determine the

range of pivoting of the shutter, wherein the abutment and/or
latching unit (3) can be fixed in different positions relative to the bar

member (1) via fixing elements (7, 11, 12),

characterised in that

a clasp spring (22) substantially engages around the hinge spigot (2),
is arranged between the shutter hinge member (19) and the bar

member (1) and is secured at one end (24) to the shutter hinge
member (19), or to the bar member (1), and in that the free end (28)

of the clasp spring (22) can be coupled to a driver (27) in the region
of the open position of the shutter and can be tensioned by the

driver which is provided at the shutter hinge member (19), or at the
bar member (1).
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 1,

characterised in that
 
the fixing elements (7, 11, 12) in the abutment and/or latching unit

(3) are adjustably mounted and are braced against two substantially
oppositely disposed regions of the bar member (1).
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 2,

characterised in that

at least one fixing element is formed as a screw, in particular as a
grub screw (7), with the end (9) of the screw remote from the actuating

end (8) acting on the bar member (1) at the side.
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 2 or claim 3,

characterised in that

at least one fixing element comprises an axially non-displaceable
guide screw (11) rotatably mounted at the abutment and/or latching

unit (3) and a support element (12) screwed to the guide screw and
having at least one guide projection (17, 17'), in particular a guide

projection formed as an inclined surface.
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 4,

characterised in that

at least one inclined guide (18, 18') is provided at the abutment

and/or latching unit (3) and cooperates with the respective guide
projection (17, 17') of the support element (12), and in that the support

element (12) is displaceable by rotation of the guide screw (11)
along the inclined guide (18, 18'), whereby the support element (12)

is movable in the direction of the bar member (1) for the support of
the abutment and/or latching unit (3) on the bar member. 
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 4 or claim 5,

characterised in that

the region of the support element (12) acting on the bar member (1)
is of substantially convex curved shape (29) parallel to the plane of

pivoting of the abutment and/or latching unit (3).
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 4, 5 or 6,

characterised in that

the region of the support element (12) acting on the bar member (1)
is substantially concavely curved (30) perpendicular to the plane of

pivoting of the abutment and/or latching unit (3) and engages
around a region of the bar member (1).
Hinge fitting in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

a displaceably mounted latch projection (4), in particular a latch
projection standing under spring bias, is provided at the abutment

and/or latching unit (3) and engages in the open position of the
shutter into a latch recess (26) provided in the shutter hinge member

(19).
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 8,

characterised in that

the side surfaces of the latch projection (4) are formed as inclined
surfaces (10).
Hinge fitting in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 
a recess (21) in which the clasp spring (22) is arranged and secured

at one end (24) is provided at the lower side of the shutter hinge
member (19), at least in the region of the hinge sleeve (19'), and in

that the driver (27) is provided on the bar member (1), engages into
the cut-out (21) and is freely movable in the cut-out (21) between

the closed position and the coupling position of the shutter.
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 10,

characterised in that

a cover surface (23) is provided at the region of the bar member (1)
facing the recess (21) which substantially covers over the recess (21)

provided in the shutter hinge member (19), and in that the driver
(27) projects beyond the cover surface (23) and engages into the recess

(21).
Hinge fitting in accordance with claim 10 or 11,

characterised in that

the free end (28) of the clasp spring (22) is bent radially outwardly
and the driver (27) contacts the outwardly bent free end in the coupling

position.
