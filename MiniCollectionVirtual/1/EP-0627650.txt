<ABSTRACT>
A photographic camera comprises a camera body (3) with a 
loading chamber (5) for receiving a film cassette (7) endwise, 

a door (11) supported for pivotal closing and opening 
movement to cover and uncover the chamber, latching means 

(29) for preventing pivotal opening movement of the door 
(11) but which can be disabled to permit the door to be 

opened, and ejecting means (33, 37, 41) for pushing the 
cassette endwise at least part way out of the chamber. 

According to the invention, the ejecting means includes 
single piece means (33) supported for movement in an ejecting 

direction for first disabling the latching means (29) to 
permit the door (11) to be opened and then pushing the 

cassette (7) endwise at least part way out of the chamber 
(5) when the door is opened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of 
photography, and in particular to apparatus for ejecting 
a film cassette at least part way out of a cassette 
receiving chamber located in the body of a camera. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,914, 
issued Sep. 17, 1991, discloses a photographic camera 
comprising a camera body with a loading chamber for 
receiving a film cassette endwise, i.e. axially, a door 
supported for pivotal closing and opening movement to 
cover and uncover the chamber, latching means for 
preventing pivotal opening movement of the door but which 
can be disabled to permit the door to be opened, and 
ejecting means for pushing the cassette endwise at least 
part way out of the chamber when the door is opened. 
Specifically, the ejecting means includes an over-center 
linkage that first is shifted to slightly beyond a 
centered position, without moving a film cassette in the 
chamber, responsive to the door being opened manually a 
limited amount, and then by virtue of its construction 
shifts itself further from its centered position (without 
having to continue to manually open the door) to 
automatically further open the door and push the cassette 
at least part way out of the chamber. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,914, the latching means 
must be disabled manually before the door can be opened. A photographic camera comprising a camera body 
with a loading chamber for receiving a film cassette 
endwise, a door supported for pivotal closing and opening 
movement to cover and uncover the chamber, latching means 
for preventing pivotal opening movement of the door but 
which can be disabled to permit the door to be opened, 
and ejecting means for pushing the cassette endwise at  
 
least part way out of the chamber, is characterized in 
that:
 
   the ejecting means includes single piece means 
supported for movement in an ejecting direction for first 
disabling the latching means to permit the door to be 
opened and then pushing the cassette endwise at least 
part way out of the chamber when the door is opened. FIGS. 1-4 are perspective views of an end 
portion of a camera body including cassette ejecting 
apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the 
invention, showing successive steps of the operation of 
the cassette ejecting apparatus. The invention is disclosed as being embodied 
preferably in a 35 mm still-picture camera. Because the 
features of this type camera are generally well known, 
the description which follows is directed in particular 
to camera elements
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A photographic camera comprising a camera 
body with a loading chamber for receiving a film cassette 

endwise, a door supported for pivotal closing and opening 
movement to cover and uncover said chamber, latching 

means for preventing pivotal opening movement of said 
door but which can be disabled to permit the door to be 

opened, and ejecting means for pushing the cassette 
endwise at least part way out of said chamber, is 

characterized in that: 
   said ejecting means includes single piece means 

supported for movement in an ejecting direction for first 
disabling said latching means to permit said door to be 

opened and then pushing the cassette endwise at least 
part way out of said chamber when the door is opened. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
1, wherein said ejecting means includes a spring for 

moving said single piece means in said ejecting direction 
to push the cassette endwise at least part way out of 

said chamber, and said latching means includes movable 
restraining means located in the way of said single piece 

means for preventing said spring from moving said single 
piece means in said ejecting direction to disable the 

latching means but which can be moved out of the way of 
the single piece means responsive to the single piece 

means being manually pushed in the ejecting direction. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
2, wherein said camera body includes a guide slot having 

a first section extending in said ejecting direction and 
a second section extending transversely from said first 

section in an opening direction said door is opened, said 
door is supported for translational movement in said 

ejecting direction besides being supported for pivotal 
closing and opening movement and includes a guide pin 

located in said guide slot to prevent the door from being 
opened whe
n said pin is within said first section of the 
slot and to permit the door to be opened when the pin is 

within said second section of the slot, said single piece 
means includes integral means for pushing said pin in 

 
said ejecting direction along said first section of said 

slot to said second section of the slot to move said door 
in the ejecting direction, and a spring is arranged to 

move said door open when said pin is within said second 
section of said slot. 
A photographic camera comprising a loading 
chamber for receiving a film cassette endwise, a door for 

covering said chamber, and ejecting means for moving the 
cassette out of said chamber, is characterized in that: 

   said door is supported first for translational 
movement part way from said chamber and then for pivotal 

movement further from the chamber to open the door; and 
   said ejecting means includes movable means for 

translationally moving said door and the cassette part 
way from said chamber and for translationally moving the 

cassette without the door further from the chamber when 
the door is pivotally moved further from the chamber. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
4, wherein latching means prevents movement of said door 

but can be disabled to permit the door to be moved, and 
said movable means includes integral means for disabling 

said latching means.
