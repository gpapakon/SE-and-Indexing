<ABSTRACT>
Sigma-delta modulator comprising a low-pass filter of the Nth order, 
which is constituted by a series combination of N first-order integrating sections (6.1, 

6.2, 6.3, ..., 6.N) comprising each an integrator (12.1, 12.2, 12.3, ..., 12.N) and a 
limiter (14.1, 14.2, 14.3, ..., 14.N). The individual output signals of the sections are 

weighted by means of corresponding weighting amplifiers (16.1, 16.2, 16.3, ..., 16.N) 
and added together in an adder stage (18). The gains of the sections and the limiting 

values of the limiters are selected so that the last limiter (14.N) in the series 
arrangement is activated first when the signal level in the sigma-delta modulator 

increases, subsequently the last-but-one limiter, and so on. This reduces the order of the 
filter system each time by one when there is an increasing signal level, and causes the 

sigma-delta modulator to remain stable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sigma-delta modulator for converting an input 
signal to a digital output signal, comprising: 
a difference stage for generating a difference signal in response to the difference 
between the input signal and a feedback signal; filter means including:
 
   a plurality of N first-order integrating sections of rank K where K ranges 
from 1 to N, these sections being connected in series in ascending order of rank, 
where K and N are integers greater than or equal to 1, each separate section 
having an input and an output for producing a section signal and a first-order 
transfer function from the input to the output with a section gain GK of rank K, 
the input of the section of rank 1 being connected for receiving the difference 
signal and from the remaining sections the input of the section of rank K being 
coupled to the output of the preceding section of rank K-1;
 
   an equally large plurality of N weighting amplifiers of rank K where K 
ranges from 1 to N, having each an input coupled to the output of the section of 
the same rank and having each an individual weight factor WK of rank K, for 
generating N weighted signals;
 
   an adder stage for generating a filter signal in response to the sum of the 
N weighted signals; a quantizer for converting the filter signal to the digital output signal; and feedback means for generating the feedback signal in response to the digital 
output signal. A sigma-delta modulator of this type is known from the journal article: 
"A Stereo 16-Bit Delta-Sigma A/D Converter for Digital Audio", Journal of the Audio 
Engineering Society, Vol. 37, No.6, June 1989, pp. 476-486, Fig. 5. Sigma-delta 
modulation is a technique in which a digital high-resolution output signal is obtained 
with the aid of a low-resolution quantizer when oversampling is applied. In this  
 
technique the digital output signal is fed back and subtracted from the input signal, the 
difference signal obtained is filtered by low-pass filter means and applied to the 
quantizer. The use of a sufficiently high loop gain for frequencies in the baseband of the 
input signal achieves that the baseband quantizing noise in the digital output signal is 
small at the cost of a higher quantizing noise for frequencies above the baseband. This 
effect is known as noise shaping. The attainable signal-to-noise ratio in the baseband of 
the digital output signal depends, for example, on the extent of oversampling and on the 
order of the filter means. A higher-order filter is favourable

characterized in that each of the sections comprises a limiter for limiting the amplitude 

of the relevant section signal to a section limit value LK of rank K and in that, for each 
value of rank K exceeding 2 the quotient value QK of the quotient of the section limit 

value LK of rank K and a value resulting from the product of the section gain GK of 
rank K, the section gain GK-1 of a rank that is one less than K, and so on up to and 

 
including the section gain G₁ of rank 1, is smaller than the quotient value QK-1 of the 

quotient of the section limit value LK-1 of rank K-1 and a value resulting from the 
product of the section gain GK-1 of rank K-1, the section gain GK-2 of a rank that is 

one less than K-1, and soon up to and including the section gain G₁ of rank 1. 
Sigma-delta modulator as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the 
sigma-delta modulator comprises supply voltage means for supplying the sections with 

supply voltages which determine for the relevant section signal a signal excursion range 
which is substantially equally large as the relevant section limit value.
