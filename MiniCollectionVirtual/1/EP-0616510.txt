<ABSTRACT>
A medication dispenser (2, 120) is used to directly fill a syringe (8, 134) with measured amounts of one or more liquid medications, typically two different types of insulin, from containers, such as vials (4, 6) and cartridges (230, 232, 234) each having a septum at one end; each cartridge has a pierceable piston (256) at the other end. The septum of each container is pierced by hollow liquid spikes (54) while hollow gas spikes (56) pierce the septum of the vial and the piston of the cartridge. Liquid is pumped out of the container and air is replaced into the container through the liquid and gas spikes. Two of the cartridges can contain a diluent (231) and a lyophilized component (233) respectively; the diluent in the first cartridge can be pumped into the second cartridge through a one-way valve to create a mixed pharmaceutical which is then pumped into the syringe, with or without another pharmaceutical.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYRINGE-FILLING AND MEDICATION MIXING DISPENSERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Therapeutic insulin is of three basic types: fast- acting, intermediate-acting and long-acting. Insulin users often use a combination of. two types of insulin depending on the user's blood sugar level, the time of day, nourishment intake and expected activity. For example, insulin injected at the beginning of an active day may have more of the fast-acting insulin, while the insulin injection given at the end of the day before going to bed would likely have more intermediate or long- acting insulin.One of the problems with conventional insulin syringes is that they are designed to inject only one type of insulin, not a combination. Although insulin can be obtained as a mixture of the two types, the mixtures are generally a preset combination, such as 70% intermediate-acting and 30% fast-acting. Thus, the prior art limits the insulin user to a set mixture of the two insulins or the need to make two separate injections.Another problem relates to pharmaceuticals which are kept in a lyophilized (dried) condition until use; they are then mixed with a diluent to reconstitute the pharmaceutical. This is conventionally done by syringe transfer.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a medication dispenser which can be used with one or more conventional medication containing containers, such as vials or cartridges, to supply a conventional syringe with a desired amount of the one or more medications. This permits the user to deliver medication, such as insulin, in desired amounts and proportions of each from a single, typically conventional, syringe. The dispenser also permits reconstituting a lyophilized pharmaceutical by mixing two 

 or more pharmaceutical components prior to supplying the syringe with the medication.The medication dispenser is typically used to directly fill a syringe with measured amounts of one or more liquid medications. The dispenser includes a body which has a number of cavities which are used to hold or position two or more liquid medication containers, typically vials or cartridges, and a syringe. The vials and cartridges are of the type having a septum at one end. The septum of each vial is pierced by a pair of hollow spikes. One of the spikes, the liquid spike, is used to allow the liquid medication to flow out of the vial while the other spike, the gas spike, is used to introduce air into the vial to replace the liquid medication drawn from the vial. With cartridge, the liquid spike
